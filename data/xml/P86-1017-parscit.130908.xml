Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999914">
Here we address the problem of mapping phrase meanings
into their conceptual representations. Figurative phrases are
pervasive in human communication, yet they are difficult to
explain theoretically. In fact, the ability to handle idiosyncrat-
ic behavior of phrases should be a criterion for any theory of
lexical representation. Due to the huge number of such
phrases in the English language, phrase representation must be
amenable to parsing, generation, and also to learning. In this
paper we demonstrate a semantic representation which facili-
tates, for a wide variety of phrases, both learning and parsing.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982050928571429">
The phrasal approach to language processing [13ecker75,
Pawley83, Fillmore86] emphasizes the role of the lexicon as a
knowledge source. Rather than maintaining a single generic
lexical entry for each word, e.g.: take, the lexicon contains
many phrases, e.g.: take over, take it or leave it,
take it up with, take it for granted, etc. Although
this approach proves effective in parsing and in generation
[Wilensky84], there are three problems which require further
investigation. First, phrase interaction: the lexicon provides
representation for single phrases, such as take to task and
make up one&apos;s mind. Yet it is required to analyze complex
clauses such as he made up his mind to take her to
task. The problem lies with the way the meanings of the two
phrases interact to form the compound meaning. Second,
phrase ambiguity: [Zernik86] phrasal parsing shifts the task
from single-word selection to the selection of entire lexical
phrases. When a set of lexical phrases appear syntactically
equivalent, i.e.: he ran into a friend, he ran into an
1986 Mercedes, he ran into the store, and he ran
into trouble again, disambiguation must be performed by
semantic means. The conditions which facilitate phrase
discrimination reside within each lexical entry itself. Third,
phrase idiosyncracy: the meaning representation of phrases
such as: lay down the law VS. put one&apos;s foot down,
must distinguish the special use of each phrase. This paper is
concerned in the representation of phrase meanings and the
process of acquiring these meanings from examples in context.

1.1 The Task Domain
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971752051282051">
Consider the figurative phrases in the sentences below, as
they are parsed by the program RINA [Zerni1c85a].
Si: The Democrats in the house carried the water for
Reagan&apos;s tax-reform bill.**
S2: The famous mobster evaded prosecution for
years. Finally, they threw the book at him
for tax evasion.
Depending on the contents of the given lexicon, the program
may interpret these sentences in one of two ways. On the one
hand, assuming that the meaning of a phrase exists in the lexi-
con, the program applies that meaning in the comprehension of
the sentence. In Si, the program understands that the Demo-
cratic representatives did the &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; work in passing the bill
for Reagan. On the other hand, if the figurative phrase does
not exist in the lexicon, an additional task is performed: the
program must figure out the meaning of the new phrase, using
existing knowledge: First, the meanings given for the single
words carry and water are processed literally. Second, the
context which exists prior to the application of the phrase, pro-
vides a hypothesis for the formation of the phrase meaning. A
dialog with RINA proceeds as follows:
RINA: They moved water?
User: No. The Democrats carried the water for
Reagan.
RINA: They helped him pass the bill?
Thus, RINA detects the metaphor underlying the phrase,
and using the context, it learns that carry the water means
helping another person do a hard job. Consider encounters
with three other phrases:
Jenny wanted to go punk but her father
S3: laid down the law.
S4: put his foot down.
S5: read her the riot act.
In all these cases, it is understood from the context that
Jenny&apos;s father objected to her plan of going punk (aided by the
word but which suggests that something went wrong with
Jenny&apos;s goals). However, what is the meaning of each one of
the phrases, and in particular do all these phrases convey ident-
ical concepts?

1.2 The Issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999451">
In encoding meanings of figurative phrases, we must ad-
dress the following issues.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.521627">
Underlying Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998240333333333">
What is the knowledge required in order to encode the
phrase throw the book? Clearly, this knowledge includes the
situation and the events that take place in court, namely the
judge punishing the defendant.
The phrase carry the water, for example, requires two
kinds of knowledge:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987939">
(a) Knowledge about the act of carrying water which can
support the analysis of the phrase metaphor.
(b) Knowledge about general plans and goals, and the way
one person agrees to serve as an agent in the execution of
the plans of another person. This knowledge supports the
analysis of the context.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991325">
While the phrases above could be denoted in terms of
plans and goals, other phrases, i.e.: rub one&apos; s nose in it,
climb the walls, and have a chip on one&apos;s shoulder
require knowledge about emotions, such as embarrassment
and frustration. Unless the program maintains knowledge
about resentment, the phrase have a chip on the should-
er, for example, cannot be represented. Thus, a variety of
knowledge structures take place in encoding figurative phrases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.74746">
Representing Phrase Meanings and Connotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998544518518519">
The appearance of each phrase carries certain implica-
tions. For example, John put his foot down implies that
John refused a request, and on the other hand, John read the
riot act implies that he reacted angrily about a certain event
in the past. John gave Mary a hard time implies that he re-
fused to cooperate, and argued with Mary since he was an-
noyed, while John laid down the law implies that John im-
posed his authority in a discussion. The representation of each
phrase must account for such implications.
Three different phrases in sentences S3-S5 are applied in
the same context. However, not any phrase may be applied in
every context. For example, consider the context established
by this paragraph:
S6: Usually, Mary put up with her husband&apos;s cook-
ing, but when he served her cold potatoes
for breakfast, sheputherfootdomm.
Could the phrase in this sentence be replaced by the other two
phrases: 00 lay down the law,Or(b) read the riot act?
While understandable, these two phrases are not appropriate in
that context. The sentence she read him the riot act
does not make sense in the context of debating food taste. The
sentence she laid down the law does not make as much
sense since there is no argument between individuals with
non-equal authority. Thus, there are conditions for the appli-
cability of each lexical phrase in various contexts. These con-
ditions support phrase disambiguation, and must be included
as part of a phrase meaning.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.949087">
Phrase Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8117357">
Phrase meanings are learned from examples given in con-
text. Suppose the structure and meaning of put one&apos;s foot
down is acquired through the analysis of the following sen-
tences:
S6: Usually, Mary put up with her husband&apos;s cook-
ing, but when he served her cold potatoes
for breakfast, she put her foot down .
S7: Jenny was dating a new boyfriend and started
to show up after midnight. When she came
at 2am on a weekday, her father put his Amt
down: no more late dates.
S8: From time to time I took money from John, and
I did not always remember to give it back
to him. He put his foot down yesterday when I
asked him for a quarter.
Since each example contains many concepts, both appropriate
and inappropriate, the appropriate concepts must be identified
and selected. Furthermore, although each example provides
only a specific episode, the ultimate meaning must be general-
ized to encompass further episodes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.808613">
Literal Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929666666667">
Single-word senses (e.g.: the sense of the particle into in
run into another car), as well as entire metaphoric actions
(e.g.: carry the water in the Democratic representa-
tives carried the water for Reagan&apos;s tax-reform
bill) take part in forming the meaning of unknown figurative
phrases. Can the meaning of a phrase be acquired in spite of
the fact that its original metaphor is unknown, as is the case
with read the riot act (what act exactly?) or carry the
water (carry what water)?
</bodyText>

2. The Program
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984571428571">
The program RINA [Zernik8513] is designed to parse sen-
tences which include figurative phrases. When the meaning of
a phrase is given, that meaning is used in forming the concept
of the sentence. However, when the phrase is unknown, the
figurative phrase should be acquired from the context. The pro-
gram consists of three components: phrasal parser, phrasal lex-
icon, and phrasal acquisition module.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988361">
2.1 Phrasal Parser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998326666666667">
A lexical entry, a phrase, is a triple associating a linguistic
pattern with its concept and a situation. A clause in the input
text is parsed in three steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994569">
(1) Matching the phrase pattern against the clause in the text.
(2) Validating in the context the relations specified by the
phrase situation.
(3) If both (1) and (2) are successful then instantiating the
phrase concept using variable bindings computed in (1)
and (2).
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.995333">
107
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.97718825">
For example, consider the sentence:
S9: Fred wanted to marry Sheila, but she ducked
the issue for years. Finally he put her on the
Spot.
The figurative phrase is parsed relative to the context esta-
blished by the first sentence. Assume that the lexicon contains
a single phrase, described informally as:
phrase
pattern: Person 1 put Person2 on the spot
situation: Person2 avoids making a certain tough decision
concept: Person 1 prompts Person2 to make that decision
The steps in parsing the clause using this phrase are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9922791">
(1) The pattern is matched successfully against the text.
Consequently, Personl and Person2 are bound to Fred
and Sheila respectively.
(2) The situation associated with the pattern is validated in
the context. After reading the first phrase the context
contains two concepts: (a) Fred wants to marry Sheila,
and (b) she avoids a decision. The situation matches the
input.
(3) Since both (1) and (2) are successful, then the pattern it-
self is instantiated, adding to the context:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987045857142857">
Fred prompted Sheila to make up her mind.
Phrase situation, distinguished from phrase concept, is intro-
duced in our representation, since it help solve three problems:
(a) in disambiguation it provides a discrimination condition for
phrase selection, (b) in generation it determines if the phrase is
applicable, and (c) in acquisition it allows the incorporation of
the input context as part of the phrase.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998465">
2.2 Phrasal Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993775">
RINA uses a declarative phrasal lexicon which is imple-
mented through GATE [Mueller84] using unification [Kay79]
as the grammatic mechanism. Below are some sample phrasal
patterns.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.9592086">
Pl: ?x &lt;lay down&gt; &lt;the law&gt;
P2: ?x throw &lt;the book&gt; &lt;at ?y&gt;
These patterns actually stand for the slot fillers given below:
Pl: (subject ?x (class person))
(verb (root lay)(modifier down))
(object (determiner the) (noun law))
P2: (subject ?x (class person))
(verb (root throw))
(object ?z (marker at)(class person)))
(object (determiner the) (noun book))

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.767232">
2.3 Phrase Acquisition through Generalization and
Refinement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966437789473684">
Phrases are acquired in a process of hypothesis formation
and error correction. The program generates and refines hy-
potheses about both the linguistic pattern, and the conceptual
meaning of phrases. For example, in acquiring the phrase
carry the water, RENA first uses the phrase already existing
in the lexicon, but it is too general a pattern and does not make
sense in the context.
?x carry:verb ?z:phys-obj &lt;for ?y&gt;
Clearly, such a syntactic error stems from a conceptual error.
Once corrected, the hypothesis is:
?x carry:verb &lt;the water&gt; &lt;for ?y&gt;
The meaning of a phrase is constructed by identifying salient
features in the context. Such features are given in terms of
scripts, relationships, plan/goal situations and emotions. For
example, carry the water is given in terms of agency goal
situation (?x executes a plan for ?x) on the background of
rivalry relationship (?x and ?y are opponents). Only by
detecting these elements in the context can the program learn
the meaning of the phrase.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.978755" genericHeader="method">
3. Conceptual Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999402">
The key for phrase acquisition is appropriate conceptual
representation, which accounts for various aspects of phrase
meanings.
Consider the phrase to throw the book in the following
paragraph:
S2: The famous mobster avoided prosecution for
years. Finally theythrewthebook at him for
tax evasion.
We analyze here the components in the representation of this
phrase.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98405">
3.1 Scripts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999726">
Basically, the figurative phrase depicts the trial script
which is given below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.926951">
(a) The prosecutor says his arguments to the judge
(b) The defendant says his arguments to the judge
(c) The judge determines the outcome, either:
(1) to punish the defendant
(2) not to punish the, defendant
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97951675">
This script involves a Judge, a Defendant, and a Prosecutor,
and it describes a sequence of events. Within the script, the
phrase points to a single event, the decision to punish the de-
fendant. However, this event presents only a rough approxi-
mation of the real meaning which requires further refinement.
(a) The phrase may be applied in situations that are more
general than the trial script itself. For example:
S10: When they caught him cheating in an exam for
the third time, the dean of the school de-
cided tothrowthebook at him.
Although the context does not contain the specific trial
script, the social authority which relates the judge and the
defendant exists also between the dean and John.
(b) The phrase in S2 asserts not only that the mobster was
punished by the judge, but also that a certain prosecution
strategy was applied against him.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996514">

<bodyText confidence="0.99887">
The representation of the phrase take it up with, for exam-
ple, is given below:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993447">
3.2 Specific Plans and Goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.877656166666667">
In order to accommodate such knowledge, scripts incor-
porate specific planning situations. For example, in prosecuting
a person, there are three options, a basic rule and two devia-
tions:
(a) Basically, for each law violation, assign a penalty as
prescribed in the book.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96050975">
(b) However, in order to loosen a prescribed penalty, mitigat-
ing circumstances may be taken into account.
(c) And on the other hand, in order to toughen a prescribed
penalty, additional violations may be thrown in.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999296">
In S2 the phrase conveys the concept that the mobster is pun-
ished for tax evasion since they cannot prosecute him for his
more serious crimes. It is the selection of this particular
prosecution plan which is depicted by the phrase. The phrase
representation is given below,
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.803170615384615">
phrase
pattern ?x:person throw:verb
&lt;the book&gt; &lt;at ?y:person&gt;
situation (Strial (prosecution ?x)
(defendant ?y))
concept (act (select-plan

(plan (ulterior-crime

(crime-of ?})M)
(result (thwart-goal

(goal-of ?y)))
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.950231">
where ulterior-crime is the third prosecution plan above.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.896883">
3.3 Relationships
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980392">
The authority relationship [Schank78, Carbone1179] is per-
vasive in phrase meanings, appearing in many domains:
judge-defendant, teacher-student, employer-employee, parent-
child, etc. The existence of authority creates certain expecta-
tions; if X presents an authority for Y, then:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.927219125">
(a) X issues rules which Y has to follow.
(b) Y is expected to follow these rules.
(c) Y is expected to support goals of X.
(d) X may punish Y if Y violates the rules in (a).
(e) X cannot dictate actions of Y; X can only appeal to Y to
act in a certain way.
(0 X can delegate his authority to Z which becomes an au-
thority for Y.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947495">
In S10, the dean of the school presents an authority for John.
John violated the rules of the school and is punished by the
dean. More phrases involving authority are given by the fol-
lowing examples.

The underlying situation is an authority relationship between
X and Y. The phrase implies that X appeals to Y so that Y

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965918">
3.4 Abstract Planning Situations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.725359914285714">
General planning situations, such as agency, agreement,
goal-conflict and goal-coincidence [Wilensky83] are addressed
in the examples below.
Si: The Democrats in the house carried the water for
Reagan in his tax-reform bill.
The phrase in Si is described using both rivalry and agency.
In contrast to expectations stemming from rivalry, the actor
serves as an agent in executing his opponent&apos;s plans. The
representation of the phrase is given below:
phrase
pattern ?x:person carry:verb
&lt;the water ?z:plan&gt; &lt;for ?y:person&gt;
situation (rivalry (actorl ?x) (actor2 ?y))
concept (agency (agent ?x)
(plan ?z)
(plan-of ?y))
Many other phrases describe situations at the abstract goal/plan
level. Consider S14:
S14: I planned to do my CS20 project with Fred. I
backed out of it when I heard that he had
flunked CS20 twice in the past.
Back out of depicts an agreed plan which is cancelled by one
party in contradiction to expectations stemming from the
agreement.
S15: John&apos;s strongest feature in arguing is his
ability tofallbackoa his quick wit.
Fall back on introduces a recovery of a goal through an al-
ternative plan, in spite of a failure of the originally selected
plan.
S16: My standing in the tennis club deteriorated
since I was bogged down with CS20 assignments
the whole summer.
In bog down, a goal competition over the actor&apos;s time exists
between a major goal (tennis) and a minor goal (CS20). The
major goal fails due to the efforts invested in the minor goal.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979028">
3.5 Emotions and Attitudes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.919825533333333">
In text comprehension, emotions [Dyer83, Mueller85] and
attitudes are accounted for in two ways: (a) they are generated
by goal/planning situations, such as goal failure and goal
achievement, and (b) they generate goals, and influence plan
selection. Some examples of phrases involving emotions are
given below. Humiliation is experienced by a person when
other people achieve a goal which he fails to achieve. The
phrase in S17 depicts humiliation which is caused when John
reminds the speaker of his goal situation:
S17: I failed my CS20 class. My friend John rubbed
mynoseinit by telling me that he got an A+.
Resentment is experienced by a person when a certain goal of
his is not being satisfied. This goal situation causes the execu-
tion of plans by that person to deteriorate. The phrase in S18
depicts such an attitude:
S18: Since clients started to complain about John,
his boss asked him if he had a chip on his
shoulder.
Embarrassment is experienced by a person when his plan
failure is revealed to other people. The phrase in S19, depicts
embarrassment which is caused when a person is prompted to
make up his mind between several bad options.
S19: Ted Koppel put his guest on the spot when he asked
him if he was ready to denounce appartheid
in South Africa.
In all the examples above, it is not the emotion itself which is
conveyed by the phrase. Rather, the concept conveys a certain
goal situation which causes that emotion. For example, in S20
(rub one&apos;s nose) a person does something which causes the
speaker to experience humiliation.

4. Learning Phrase Meanings

Consider the situation when a new phrase is first encoun-
tered by the program:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.8139952">
User: The Democrats in the house carried the water
for Reagan&apos;s tax-reform bill.
RINA: They moved water?
User: No. They carried the water for him.
R1NA: They helped him pass the bill.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.5597785">
Three sources take part in forming the new concept, (a) the
linguistic clues, (b) the context, and (c) the metaphor.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994635">
4.1 The Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997782">
The context prior to reading the phrase includes two con-
cepts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.409608333333333">
(a) Reagan has a goal of passing a law.
(b) The Democrats are Reagan&apos;s rivals—they are expected to
thwart his goals, his legislation in particular.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998974">
These concepts provide the phrase situation which specifies
the context required for the application of the phrase.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995747">
4.2 The Literal Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983714285714">
The literal interpretation of carried the water as
&amp;quot;moved water&amp;quot; does not make sense given the goal/plan situa-
tion in the context. As a result, RINA generates the literal in-
terpretation and awaits confirmation from the user. If the user
repeats the utterance or generates a negation, then R1NA gen-
erates a number of utterances, based on the current context, in
hypothesizing a novel phrase interpretation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998274">
4.3 The Metaphor
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997597888888889">
Since the action of moving water does not make sense
literally, it is examined at the level of plans and goals: Moving
water from location A to B is a low-level plan which supports
other high-level plans (i.e., using the water in location B).
Thus, at the goal/plan level, the phrase is perceived as: &amp;quot;they
executed a low-level plan as his agents&amp;quot; (the agency is suggest-
ed by the prepositional phrase: for his tax-reform bill;
i.e., they did an act for his goal). This is taken as the phrase
concept.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991643">
4.4 The Constructed Meaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996922">
The new phrase contains three parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.793809125">
(a) The phrase pattern is extracted from the example sen-
tence:
?x carry:verb &lt;the water&gt; &lt;for ?y&gt;
(b) The phrase situation is extracted from the underlying
context:
(rivalry (actorl ?x) (actor2 ?y))
(c) The phrase concept is taken from the metaphor:
(plan-agency (actor ?x) (plan ?z) (plan-of ?y))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995445">
Thus, the phrase means that in a rivalry situation, an opponent
served as an agent in carrying out a plan.

5. Future Work and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921058823529">
The phrasal approach elevates language processing from
interaction among single words to interaction among entire
phrases. Although it increases substantially the size of the lexi-
con, this chunking simplifies the complexity of parsing since
clauses in the text include fewer modules which interact in
fewer ways. The phrasal approach does reduce the power of
the program in handling non-standard uses of phrases. For ex-
ample, consider the situation where a mobster kidnaps a judge,
points the gun at him, and says: No funny book you could
throw at me now would do you any good!*. Our current
parser would certainly fail in matching the syntactic pattern
and inferring the ironic meaning. The analysis of such a sen-
tence would require that the program associate the two exist-
ing phrases, the general throw something and the figurative
throw the book, and make inferences about the pun meant by
the mobster. Such examples show that it is difficult to capture
human behavior through a single parsing paradigm.

Parsing text is a futile task unless it addresses the ultimate
objective of language processing, namely mapping text into
conceptual representation. To this end, we have shown the
structure of a lexicon which provides the association between
syntactic patterns with their semantic concepts. However, due
to the huge size of the English language, not all phrases can be
given at the outset. A parsing program is required to handle
unknown phrases as they are encountered in the text. In RINA
we have shown how new phrases can be acquired from exam-
ples in context.
Phrase acquisition from context raises questions regarding
the volume of knowledge required for language processing. A
phrase such as throw the book requires highly specialized
knowledge involving sentencing strategies in court. Now, this
is only one figurative phrase out of many. Thus, in order to
handle figurative phrases in general, a program must ultimately
have access to all the knowledge of a socially mature person.
Fortunately, learning makes this problem more tractible. In the
process of phrase acquisition, phrase meaning is elevated from
the specific domain in which the phrase has originated to a lev-
el of abstract goal situations. For example, once throw the
book is understood as the act of authority-decree, then
knowledge of the trial situation no longer needs to be accessed.
The phrase is well comprehended in other domains: my boss
threw the book at me, his parents threw the book at
him, her teacher threw the book at her, etc. At that
level, a finite number of goal situations can support the appli-
cation of figurative phrases across a very large number of
domains.

Literal Interpretation Single-word senses (e.g.: the sense of the particle into in run into another car), as well as entire metaphoric actions (e.g.: carry the water in the Democratic representatives carried the water for Reagan&apos;s tax-reform bill) take part in forming the meaning of unknown figurative phrases. Can the meaning of a phrase be acquired in spite of the fact that its original metaphor is unknown, as is the case with read the riot act (what act exactly?) or carry the water (carry what water)? 2. The Program The program RINA [Zernik8513] is designed to parse sentences which include figurative phrases. When the meaning of a phrase is given, that meaning is used in forming the concept of the sentence. However, when the phrase is unknown, the figurative phrase should be acquired from the context. The program consists of three components: phrasal parser, phrasal lexicon, and phrasal acquisition module. 2.1 Phrasal Parser A lexical entry, a phrase, is a triple associating a linguistic pattern with its concept and a situation.
