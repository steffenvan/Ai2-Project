Recent work identifies two properties that
appear particularly relevant to the charac-
terization of graph-based dependency mod-
els of syntactic structure1: the absence of
interleaving substructures (well-nestedness)
and a bound on a type of discontinuity
(gap-degree ≤ 1) successfully describe
more than 99% of the structures in two de-
pendency treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre
2006).2 Bodirsky et al. (2005) establish that
every dependency structure with these two
properties can be recast as a lexicalized
Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) deriva-
tion and vice versa. However, multi-
component extensions of TAG (MC-TAG),
argued to be necessary on linguistic
grounds, induce dependency structures that
do not conform to these two properties
(Kuhlmann and Möhl 2006). In this paper,
we observe that several types of MC-TAG
as used for linguistic analysis are more re-
strictive than the formal system is in prin-
ciple. In particular, tree-local MC-TAG,

that weak equivalence does not speak to.

projective dependency structures and the corresponding non-

Bodirsky et al. (2005) introduce a class of graphi-
cal dependency models, called graph drawings
(which differ from standard dependency struc-
tures), that are equivalent to lexicalized Tree Ad-
joining Grammar (LTAG) derivations (Joshi and
Schabes 1997). Whereas TAG is a generative
framework in which each well-formed expression
corresponds with a legitimate derivation in that
system, the graph drawing approach provides a set
of structures and a set of constraints on well-
formedness. Bodirsky et al. offer the class of
graph drawings that satisfy these constraints as a
model-based perspective on TAG. Section 2
summarizes this relationship between TAG deriva-
tions and these graph drawings.
In related work, Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006)
evaluate a number of constraints that have been
proposed to restrict the class of dependency struc-
tures characterizing natural language with respect
to two dependency treebanks: the Prague Depend-
ency Treebank (PDT) (Hajič et al., 2001) and the
Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann,
2003). The results indicate that two properties

treebanks.3 The first is a binary well-nestedness
constraint.4 The other is a bound on gap degree, a
graded measure of discontinuity. These results are
given in Table 1. What is noteworthy is that the
graph drawings which correspond to LTAG deriva-
tions share these two properties: LTAG induced
graph drawings are both well-nested and have gap
degree &lt; 1, and for every graph drawing that is
both well-nested and gap degree &lt; 1, there exists a
corresponding LTAG derivation (Möhl 2006). In
section 3, these two properties are defined.

In section 4, we show that gap degree can be
used to distinguish between strong island viola-
tions and weak island violations in English. This
supports the notion that gap-degree is a linguisti-
cally relevant measure.
Although TAG is a linguistically expressive
formalism, a closer look at the linguistic data has
motivated extensions of TAG.5 One of the most
widely used extensions for handling cases that are
difficult for classic TAG is Multi-Component TAG
(Weir 1988). Like basic TAG, MC-TAG is a for-
malism for rewriting nodes of a tree as other trees.
The set of underived trees are called elementary
trees. The rewriting is accomplished via two opera-
tions: substitution, which rewrites a leaf node la-
beled X with a tree rooted in a node labeled X, and
adjoining, which rewrites a node X with a tree that
labels both its root and a distinguished leaf node,
the foot, with X. The observation that linguistic
dependencies typically occur within some sort of
local domain is expressed in the TAG hypothesis
that all such dependencies occur within the basic

structures, but has no clear relationship to TAG-derivations.
Thus, reference to it is omitted in the remaining text. See

building blocks of the grammar. Recursive struc-
ture is “factored out,” which allows apparent non-
local dependencies to be recast as local ones.
Whereas basic TAG takes the basic unit to be a
single elementary tree, MC-TAG extends the do-
main of locality to encompass a set of elementary
trees. That is, these sets are the objects over which
the combinatory operations apply. The MC-
extension allows for linguistically satisfying ac-
counts for a number of attested phenomena, such
as: English extraposition (Kroch and Joshi 1986),
subj-aux inversion in combination with raising
verbs (Frank 1992), anaphoric binding (Ryant and
Scheffler 2006), quantifier scope ambiguity (Joshi
et al. 2003), clitic climbing in Romance (Bleam
1994), and Japanese causatives (Heycock 1986).
The primary concern of this paper is the recon-
ciliation of the observation noted above, that MC-
TAG appears to be on the right track for a good
generative characterization of natural language,
with a second observation: The graph drawings
that correspond to MC-TAG derivations, are not
guaranteed to retain the properties of basic-TAG
induced graph drawings. Kuhlmann and Möhl
(2006) report that if an entire MC set is anchored
by a single lexical element (the natural extension
of “lexicalization” of TAGs to MC-TAGs), then
the class of dependency structures is expanded
with respect to both conditions that characterized
the TAG-induced graph drawings: MC-TAG in-
duced graph drawings include structures that are
not well-nested, have gap degree &gt; 1, or both. As
Kuhlmann and Möhl point out, the gap degree in-
creases with the number of components, which we
will elaborate in section 6. This is true even if we
require that all components of a set combine with a
single elementary tree (i.e. tree-local MC-TAG,
which is known to allow more derivation structures
(i.e. derivation trees) than TAG, although they gen-
erate the same set of derived trees). If we suppose
that the characterization of dependency structures
as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for
Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e.
the dependency structures for natural language
falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree
&lt; 1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears
to correspond to the wrong class of model-
theoretic dependency structures. It is desirable to
account for the apparent mismatch.
One possibility is that the linguistic analyses that
depend on a multi-component approach are ex-

tremely infrequent, and that this is reflected in the
small proportion (&lt; 1%) of data in the PDT and
DDT that are not both well-nested and gap degree
&lt; 1. A second possibility is that the structures in
the PDT and DDT are actually not good represen-
tatives of the structures needed to characterize
natural languages in general. However, a look at
the cases in which MC-TAG is employed reveals
that these particular analyses yield derivations that
correspond to graph drawings that do satisfy well-
nestedness and have gap degree &lt; 1. In practice,
MC-TAG seems to be used more restrictively than
what the formal system allows in principle. This
keeps the corresponding graph drawings within the
class of structures identified by Bodirsky et al.
(2005) as a model of TAG derivations, and by
Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) as empirically rele-
vant. Lastly, we compare the scrambling patterns
that are possible in an MC-TAG extension with
those that conform to the well-nestedness and gap
degree &lt; 1 properties of the graph approach.

2 TAG-induced Graph Dependencies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993666666667">
The next two sections are intended to provide an
intuition for the terms defined more formally in
Bodirsky et al. (2005) and Kuhlmann and Nivre
(2006). In the former, the authors define their de-
pendency structures of interest, called graph draw-
ings, as a three-tuple: a set of nodes, a dominance
relation, and a (total) precedence relation. These
dependency structures are based on information
from both a TAG-derivation and that derivation’s
final phrase structure. The anchor of each elemen-
tary tree of a strictly lexicalized TAG (LTAG) is
used as a node label in the induced dependency
structure. E.g. suppose tree A is anchored by lexi-
cal item a in the LTAG grammar. Then a will be a
node label in any dependency structure induced by
an LTAG derivation involving tree A.
To see how the dominance relation and prece-
dence relation mirror the derivation and the final
derived phrase structure, let us further suppose that
LTAG tree B is anchored by lexical item b. Node
a dominates node b in the dependency structure iff
Tree A dominates tree B in the derivation struc-
ture. (I.e. tree B must substitute or adjoin into tree
A during the TAG-derivation.6) Node a precedes

node b in the dependency structure iff a linearly
precedes b in the derived phrase structure tree.
An example based on the cross-serial dependen-
cies seen in Dutch subordinate clauses is given in
Figure 1. In the graph drawing in (4), the four
nodes names, {Jan, de kinderen, zag, zwemmen},
are the same set as the anchors of the elementary
trees in (1), which is the same as the set of termi-
nals in (3), the derived phrase structure. The or-
dering of these nodes is exactly the ordering of the
terminals in (3). The directed edges between the
nodes mirrors the immediate dominance relation
represented in (2), the derivation structure showing
how the trees in (1) combine. E.g. Just as the
zwemmen node has the zag and de kinderen nodes
as its two children in (2), so does the zwemmen
node dominate zag and de kinderen in (4).
Möhl (2006) provides the formal details show-
ing that such LTAG-induced dependency struc-
tures have the properties of being 1) well-nested
and 2) gap degree &lt; 1, and, conversely, that any
structures with these properties have a correspond-
ing LTAG derivation.7 These properties are de-
fined in the next section.

Definition: The projection of a node x is the set of
nodes dominated by x (including x). (E.g. in (4),
the projection of zag = {Jan, zag}.)

Recall that the nodes of a graph drawing are in a
precedence relation, and that this precedence rela-
tion is total.
Definition: A gap is a discontinuity with respect to
precedence in the projection of a node in the draw-
ing. (E.g. in (4), de kinderen is the gap preventing
Jan and zag from forming a contiguous interval.)
Definition: The gap degree of a node is the num-
ber of gaps in its projection. (E.g. the gap degree of
node zag = 1.)
Definition: The gap degree of a drawing is the
maximum among the gap degrees of its nodes.
(E.g. in (4), only the projection of zag is inter-
rupted by a gap. Thus, the gap degree of the graph
drawing in (4) = 1.)
In TAG drawings, a gap arises from an interrup-
tion of the dependencies in an auxiliary tree. If B
is adjoined into A, the gap is the material in A that
is below the foot node of B. E.g. in figure 1, De
kinderen is substituted into the zwemmen tree be-
low the node into which the zag tree adjoins into
the zwemmen tree. Thus, de kinderen interrupts the
pronounced material on the left of the zag tree’s
foot node, Jan, from the pronounced material on
the right of the foot node, zag.

Definition: If the roots of two subtrees in the
drawing are not in a dominance relation, then the
trees are disjoint. (E.g. in (5), the subtrees rooted in
b and c are disjoint, while the subtrees rooted in a
and b are not.)
Definition: If nodes x1, x2 belong to tree X, nodes
y1, y2 belong to tree Y, precedence orders these
nodes: x1 &gt; y1 &gt; x2 &gt; y2, and X and Y are disjoint,
then trees X and Y interleave. (E.g. in (5), b and d
belong to the subtree rooted in b, while c and e be-
long to the subtree rooted in c. These two subtrees
are disjoint. Since the nodes are ordered b &gt; c &gt; d
&gt; e, the two trees interleave.)

joint subtrees, then a graph drawing is well-nested.

4 Island Effects and Gap-Degree
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945">
When standard TAG analyses of island effects are
adopted (see Frank 2002), we observe that differ-
ences in gap degree align with the division be-
tween wh-extractions that are attested in natural
language (grammatical wh-movement and weak
island effects) and those claimed to be prohibited
(strong island effects). Specifically, four strong
island violations, extraction from an adverbial
modifier, relative clause, complex NP, or subject,
correspond to structures of gap degree 1, while
cyclic wh-movement and a weak island violation
(extraction from a wh-island) are gap degree 0 in
English. Interestingly, while it is clear that weak
islands vary in their island status from language to
language, strong islands have been claimed to
block extraction cross-linguistically. We tenta-
tively postulate that gap degree is useful for char-
acterizing strong islands cross-linguistically.
An example is given in (6), a standard TAG
derivation for adverbial modification: the after-tree
adjoins into the buy-tree (the matrix clause), the
got-tree substitutes into the after-tree, and the two
arguments who and a-raise substitute into the got-
tree. In (7), the corresponding dependency struc-
ture, the projection of got includes who, which is
separated from got by the string comprising the
matrix clause and adverbial. Clearly, we do not
want to claim that any gap degree of 1 is a sure
source of ungrammaticality. However, it is possi-
ble that a gap degree of 1 in conjunction with a wh-
element yields ungrammaticality. For the particu-
lar set of islands we examined, we postulate that
the projection of the node immediately dominating
the wh-element is prohibited from containing gaps.

5 MC-TAG-induced Dependency Graphs
5.1 Gap-Degree Beyond 1
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950384615385">
As reviewed in section 3, the source of every gap
in a TAG drawing comes from an interruption of
the dependencies in an auxiliary tree. Since the
auxiliary tree only has one foot, it only has a slot
for a single gap. A MC-set, however, could be
comprised of two auxiliary trees. This means there
are slots for two gaps, one associated with each
foot. Furthermore, a gap may arise as a result of
any pronounced material between the two compo-
nents. Thus, when we already have at least one
foot, adding an additional foot increases the maxi-
mum gap degree by 2. The maximum gap degree
= 1 + 2(n – 1) = 2n – 1, where n is the max # of
foot nodes in any elementary tree set.
As an example, consider the composition of the
trees in (8), Figure 3 (Kuhlmann, p.c.) The tree set
in (8w) is comprised of two auxiliary trees. One
tree, (8wα), adjoins into (8a), and a gap is created
by the material in (8a) that falls below the foot
node of (8wα), namely b. When (8wR) is adjoined
into (8α) at node V, a second gap is created below
(8wR) by d. A third gap is created by the material
between the two components. (9) shows the de-
rived phrase structure, and (10), the corresponding
graph drawing. The projection of node w, {w, x, y,
z} has three discontinuities, nodes b, c, and d.

Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even a tree-
local MC-TAG that allows only substitution can
induce a non-well-nested graph drawing. Figure 4
replicates their example. This derivation involves
two MC-sets, (11b) and (11c). The tree anchored
by d, (11d), substitutes into the second component
of the set anchored by b, (11b). Similarly, the tree
anchored by e, (11e), substitutes into the second
component of the set anchored by c, (11c). Both
MC-sets compose into the tree anchored by a,
yielding the derived phrase structure in (12). The
corresponding graph drawing is exactly our earlier
example of non-well-nestedness in (5).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997735307692308">
We now turn to cases in which linguists have used
MC-TAGs to account for cases argued to have no
satisfying solution in basic TAG. Unlike the ex-
amples in 5.1 and 5.2, these particular MC-deriva-
tions correspond to dependency structures that are
well-nested and have gap degree &lt; 1. Table 2
summarizes these cases. The last column indicates
the type of MC-extension assumed by the analysis:
tree-local MC-TAGs, tree-local MC-TAGs with
flexible composition, the mirror operation to ad-
joining; if tree α adjoins into tree R, the combina-
tion can be alternatively viewed as tree R “flexibly”
composing with tree α (Joshi et al. 2003, Kall-
meyer and Joshi 2003)8, and set-local MC-TAGs.
Set-local MC-TAGs are generally more powerful
than TAGs, but since these particular cases induce
well-nested graph drawings of gap degree &lt; 1, we
can conclude that set-local MC-TAG as used in
8 I.e. When composing A and B, we can take A as the function
and B as the argument or vice versa. For CFGs, such flexibil-
ity has no added benefit. For categorical type grammars, this
kind of flexibility is accomplished via type raising, which
allows for some new types of constituents but does not give
rise to any new word orders. For tree local MC-TAGs, such
flexibility does allow more word orders (permutations) to be
generated than are possible without flexible composition.

these cases is weakly equivalent to TAG.
From Table 2, we can draw two generalizations.
First, in an MC-TAG analysis, a two-component
set is typically used. One of the trees is often a
very small piece of structure that corresponds to
the “base position,” surface position, or scope posi-
tion of a single element. Second, the auxiliary tree
components typically have elements with phono-
logical content only on one side of the foot.
At this point, we make explicit an assumption
that we believe aligns with Bodirsky et al. (2005).
Since silent elements, such as traces, do not anchor
an elementary tree, they do not correspond to a
node in the dependency structure.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988090909091">
Recall that in example (8), each of the two compo-
nents in the example MC-TAG has a foot with
phonological material on both sides, giving rise to
two gaps, and a third gap is created via the material
between the two components. In contrast, in the
MC-TAG sets shown in Table 2, the auxiliary trees
have pronounced material only on one side of the
foot node. This eliminates the gap that would have
arisen due to the interruption of material on the left
side of the foot from the right side of the foot as a
result of the pronounced material beneath the foot.
The only way to obtain pronounced material on
both sides of the foot node is to adjoin a compo-
nent into one of these auxiliary trees. Interestingly,
the set-local analyses (in which all components of
a set must combine with components of a single set
vs. tree-local MC-TAG) for clitic climbing and
Japanese causatives do posit recursive components
adjoining into other recursive components, but
only while maintaining all pronounced material on
one side of the foot. In the absence of a deriva-
tional step resulting in pronounced material on

both sides of a foot, the only remaining possible
gap is that which arises from pronounced material
that appears between the two components.
Note that the observation about the position of
pronounced material applies only to auxiliary trees
in sets with multiple components. That is, auxil-
iary trees that comprise a singleton set may still
have pronounced material on both sides of the foot.

Since Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even
a MC-TAG that allows only non-auxiliary trees in
MC-sets will expand the drawings to include non-
well-nested drawings, there is no way to pare back
the MC-TAG via restrictions on the types of trees
allowed in MC-sets so as to avoid interleaving.
Recall that to satisfy the definition of interleav-
ing, it is necessary that the two MC-sets are not in
any dominance relation in the derivation structure.
In Kuhlmann and Möhl’s example, this is satisfied
because the two MC-sets are sisters in the deriva-
tion; they combine into the same tree. In the lin-
guistic analyses considered here, no more than one
MC-set combines into the same tree. For tree-local
MC-TAG, it appears to be sufficient to bar more
than one MC-set from combining into a single tree.

<bodyText confidence="0.993167666666666">
In subordinate clauses in Standard German, the
canonical order of verbs and their subject argu-
ments is a nested dependency order. However,
other orderings are also possible. For example, in
the case of a clause-final cluster of three verbs, the
canonical order is as given in (13), NP1NP2NP3
V3V2V1, but all the other permutations of the NP
arguments are also possible orderings. All six per-
mutations of the NPs can be derived via tree-local
MC-TAG. From the graph-model perspective
adopted here, this is unsurprising: All the se-
quences are well-nested and have gap degree &lt; 1.
(13) NP1 NP2 NP3 V3 V2 V1
. . . Hans Peter Marie schwimmen lassen sah
. . . Hans Peter Marie swim make saw
“ . . . Hans saw Peter make Marie swim.”
However, with an additional level of embed-
ding, i.e. four NPs and four verbs, the situation is
different, both linguistically and formally. Our
focus is on making the formal predictions of a lin-
guistically informed system precise. We start with
a tree-local MC-TAG that is restricted to linguisti-
cally motivated tree-sets and to semantically co-
herent derivations. The former linguistic restric-
tion is illustrated in (14), the possible tree-sets an-
chored by a verb that takes a VP argument. The
latter linguistic restriction is that there is no seman-
tic feature clash at any stages of the derivation: the
VP argument of Vi must be associated with Vi+1.
Single and two-component sets for Vi
As MC-TAG is enriched in various ways (by al-
lowing flexible composition, multiple adjoining at
the same node, and/or components from the same
MC-set to target the same node), all 24 orderings
where the nouns permute while the verbs remain
fixed can be derived. (We are aware that German
also allows verbs to scramble.) Taking the depend-
ency structures of these sequences to consist of an
edge from each verb Vi to its subject NP and to the
head of its argument VP, Vi+1, we can compare the
predictions of the graph drawing approach and the
MC-TAG approach. It turns out that the permuta-
tions of gap degree &lt; 1 and those of gap-degree 2
do not align in an obvious way with particular en-
richments. For example, NP4NP2NP3NP1V4V3V2V1
(gap degree 2) is derivable via basic tree-local MC-
TAG, but NP3NP1NP4NP2V4V3V2V1 and
NP3NP2NP4NP1V4V3V2V1 (also gap degree 2) ap-
pear to require both flexible composition and al-
lowing components from the same MC-set to tar-
get the same node.

This paper reviews the connection established in
previous work between TAG derivations and
model-theoretic graph drawings, i.e. well-nested
dependency structures of gap degree &lt; 1, and re-
ports several observations that build on this work.
First, additional evidence of the linguistic rele-
vance of the gap degree measure is given. The gap
degree measure can distinguish wh-movement that
is assumed to be generally disallowed from wh-
movement that is permitted in natural language.
Second, we observe that the graph drawings in-

duced by MC-TAGs used in linguistic analyses
continue to fall within the class of well-nested, gap
degree &lt; 1 dependency structures. While
Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that MC-TAGs
in which each set has a single lexical anchor in-
duce graph drawings that are outside this class, this
extra complexity in the dependency structures does
not appear to be utilized. Even for the crucial cases
used to argue for MC-extensions, MC-TAG is used
in a manner requiring less complexity than the
formal system allows. Examining these particular
grammars lays the groundwork for identifying a
natural class of MC-TAG grammars whose deriva-
tions correspond to well-nested graph drawings of
gap degree &lt; 1. Specifically, the observations sug-
gest the class to be MC-TAGs in which 1) compo-
nent sets have up to two members, 2) auxiliary
trees that are members of non-singleton MC-sets
have pronounced material on only one side of the
foot, whether the auxiliary member is derived or
not, and 3) up to one MC-set may combine into
each tree. Though these constraints appears stipu-
lative from a formal perspective, a preliminary
look suggests that natural language will not require
their violation. That is, we may find linguistic jus-
tification for these constraints. Lastly, in ongoing
work, we explore how allowing flexible composi-
tion and multiple adjoining enables MC-TAGs to
derive a range of scrambling patterns.

(2005) introduce a class of graphical dependency models, called graph drawings (which differ from standard dependency structures), that are equivalent to lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) derivations (Joshi and Schabes 1997). Whereas TAG is a generative framework in which each well-formed expression corresponds with a legitimate derivation in that system, the graph drawing approach provides a set of structures and a set of constraints on wellformedness. Bodirsky et al. offer the class of graph drawings that satisfy these constraints as a model-based perspective on TAG. Section 2 summarizes t</context>

A second possibility is that the structures in the PDT and DDT are actually not good representatives of the structures needed to characterize natural languages in general. However, a look at the cases in which MC-TAG is employed reveals that these particular analyses yield derivations that correspond to graph drawings that do satisfy wellnestedness and have gap degree &lt; 1. In practice, MC-TAG seems to be used more restrictively than what the formal system allows in principle. This keeps the corresponding graph drawings within the class of structures identified by Bodirsky et al. (2005) as a model of TAG derivations, and by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) as empirically relevant. Lastly, we compare the scrambling patterns that are possible in an MC-TAG extension with those that conform to the well-nestedness and gap degree &lt; 1 properties of the graph approach. 2 TAG-induced Graph Dependencies The next two sections are intended to provide an intuition for the terms defined more formally in Bodirsky et al. (2005) and Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006). In the former, the authors define their dependency structures of interest, called graph drawings, as a three-tuple: a set of nodes, a dominan</context>

Canonical tree sets used in MC-TAG analyses of several phenomena these cases is weakly equivalent to TAG. From Table 2, we can draw two generalizations. First, in an MC-TAG analysis, a two-component set is typically used. One of the trees is often a very small piece of structure that corresponds to the “base position,” surface position, or scope position of a single element. Second, the auxiliary tree components typically have elements with phonological content only on one side of the foot. At this point, we make explicit an assumption that we believe aligns with Bodirsky et al. (2005). Since silent elements, such as traces, do not anchor an elementary tree, they do not correspond to a node in the dependency structure. 6.1 Why the Gap-Degree Remains ≤ 1 Recall that in example (8), each of the two components in the example MC-TAG has a foot with phonological material on both sides, giving rise to two gaps, and a third gap is created via the material between the two components. In contrast, in the MC-TAG sets shown in Table 2, the auxiliary trees have pronounced material only on one side of the foot node. This eliminates the gap that would have arisen due to the interruption </context>

In the absence of a derivational step resulting in pronounced material on 6 both sides of a foot, the only remaining possible gap is that which arises from pronounced material that appears between the two components. Note that the observation about the position of pronounced material applies only to auxiliary trees in sets with multiple components. That is, auxiliary trees that comprise a singleton set may still have pronounced material on both sides of the foot. 6.2 Why the Structures Remain Well-Nested Since Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even a MC-TAG that allows only non-auxiliary trees in MC-sets will expand the drawings to include nonwell-nested drawings, there is no way to pare back the MC-TAG via restrictions on the types of trees allowed in MC-sets so as to avoid interleaving. Recall that to satisfy the definition of interleaving, it is necessary that the two MC-sets are not in any dominance relation in the derivation structure. In Kuhlmann and Möhl’s example, this is satisfied because the two MC-sets are sisters in the derivation; they combine into the same tree. In the linguistic analyses considered here, no</context>

Section 2 summarizes this relationship between TAG derivations and these graph drawings.

In practice, MC-TAG seems to be used more restrictively than what the formal system allows in principle. This keeps the corresponding graph drawings within the class of structures identified by Bodirsky et al.

The primary concern of this paper is the reconciliation of the observation noted above, that MCTAG appears to be on the right track for a good generative characterization of natural language, with a second observation: The graph drawings that correspond to MC-TAG derivations, are not guaranteed to retain the properties of basic-TAG induced graph drawings. Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) report that if an entire MC set is anchored by a single lexical element (the natural extension of “lexicalization” of TAGs to MC-TAGs), then the class of dependency structures is expanded with respect to both conditions that characterized the TAG-induced graph drawings: MC-TAG induced graph drawings include structures that are not well-nested, have gap degree &gt; 1, or both. As Kuhlmann and Möhl point out, the gap degree increases with the number of components, which we will elaborate in section 6. This is true even if we require that all components of a set combine with a single elementary tre</context>

The ordering of these nodes is exactly the ordering of the terminals in (3). The directed edges between the nodes mirrors the immediate dominance relation represented in (2), the derivation structure showing how the trees in (1) combine. E.g. Just as the zwemmen node has the zag and de kinderen nodes as its two children in (2), so does the zwemmen node dominate zag and de kinderen in (4). Möhl (2006) provides the formal details showing that such LTAG-induced dependency structures have the properties of being 1) well-nested and 2) gap degree &lt; 1, and, conversely, that any structures with these properties have a corresponding LTAG derivation.7 These properties are defined in the next section.

The tree set in (8w) is comprised of two auxiliary trees. One tree, (8wα), adjoins into (8a), and a gap is created by the material in (8a) that falls below the foot node of (8wα), namely b. When (8wR) is adjoined into (8α) at node V, a second gap is created below (8wR) by d. A third gap is created by the material between the two components. (9) shows the derived phrase structure, and (10), the corresponding graph drawing. The projection of node w, {w, x, y, z} has three discontinuities, nodes b, c, and d. 5.2 Non-Well-Nestedness Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even a treelocal MC-TAG that allows only substitution can induce a non-well-nested graph drawing. Figure 4 replicates their example. This derivation involves two MC-sets, (11b) and (11c). The tree anchored by d, (11d), substitutes into the second component of the set anchored by b, (11b). Similarly, the tree anchored by e, (11e), substitutes into the second component of the set anchored by c, (11c). Both MC-sets compose into the tree anchored by a, yielding the derived phrase structure in (12). The corresponding graph drawing is exactly our earlier example of non-well-nestedness in </context>

In the absence of a derivational step resulting in pronounced material on 6 both sides of a foot, the only remaining possible gap is that which arises from pronounced material that appears between the two components. Note that the observation about the position of pronounced material applies only to auxiliary trees in sets with multiple components. That is, auxiliary trees that comprise a singleton set may still have pronounced material on both sides of the foot. 6.2 Why the Structures Remain Well-Nested Since Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even a MC-TAG that allows only non-auxiliary trees in MC-sets will expand the drawings to include nonwell-nested drawings, there is no way to pare back the MC-TAG via restrictions on the types of trees allowed in MC-sets so as to avoid interleaving. Recall that to satisfy the definition of interleaving, it is necessary that the two MC-sets are not in any dominance relation in the derivation structure. In Kuhlmann and Möhl’s example, this is satisfied because the two MC-sets are sisters in the derivation; they combine into the same tree. In the linguistic analyses considered here, no</context>

First, additional evidence of the linguistic relevance of the gap degree measure is given. The gap degree measure can distinguish wh-movement that is assumed to be generally disallowed from whmovement that is permitted in natural language. Second, we observe that the graph drawings in(14) NPi (e)i Vi NP VP(i+1)* VP VP VP α NPi R (e)i Vi NP VP(i+1)* VP VP* VP VP 7 duced by MC-TAGs used in linguistic analyses continue to fall within the class of well-nested, gap degree &lt; 1 dependency structures. While Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that MC-TAGs in which each set has a single lexical anchor induce graph drawings that are outside this class, this extra complexity in the dependency structures does not appear to be utilized. Even for the crucial cases used to argue for MC-extensions, MC-TAG is used in a manner requiring less complexity than the formal system allows. Examining these particular grammars lays the groundwork for identifying a natural class of MC-TAG grammars whose derivations correspond to well-nested graph drawings of gap degree &lt; 1. Specifically, the observations suggest the class to be MC-TAGs in which </context>

Recursive structure is “factored out,” which allows apparent nonlocal dependencies to be recast as local ones. Whereas basic TAG takes the basic unit to be a single elementary tree, MC-TAG extends the domain of locality to encompass a set of elementary trees. That is, these sets are the objects over which the combinatory operations apply. The MCextension allows for linguistically satisfying accounts for a number of attested phenomena, such as: English extraposition (Kroch and Joshi 1986), subj-aux inversion in combination with raising verbs (Frank 1992), anaphoric binding (Ryant and Scheffler 2006), quantifier scope ambiguity (Joshi et al. 2003), clitic climbing in Romance (Bleam 1994), and Japanese causatives (Heycock 1986).

Relevant results from Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006). In section 4, we show that gap degree can be used to distinguish between strong island violations and weak island violations in English. This supports the notion that gap-degree is a linguistically relevant measure. Although TAG is a linguistically expressive formalism, a closer look at the linguistic data has motivated extensions of TAG.5 One of the most widely used extensions for handling cases that are difficult for classic TAG is Multi-Component TAG (Weir 1988). Like basic TAG, MC-TAG is a formalism for rewriting nodes of a tree as other trees. The set of underived trees are called elementary trees. The rewriting is accomplished via two operations: substitution, which rewrites a leaf node labeled X with a tree rooted in a node labeled X, and adjoining, which rewrites a node X with a tree that labels both its root and a distinguished leaf node, the foot, with X. The observation that linguistic dependencies typically occur within some sort of local domain is expressed in the TAG hypothesis that all such dependencies occur within the basic 3 A third pr</context>
