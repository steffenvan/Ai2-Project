We present two approaches for syntactic and se-
mantic transfer based on LFG f-structures and
compare the results with existing co-description
and restriction operator based approaches, fo-
cusing on aspects of ambiguity preserving trans-
fer, complex cases of syntactic structural mis-
matches as well as on modularity and reusabil-
ity. The two transfer approaches are interfaced
with an existing, implemented transfer com-
ponent (Verbmobia by translating f-structures
into a term language, and by interfacing f-
structure representations with an existing se-
mantic based transfer approach, respectively.

Target and source levels of representation in
transfer-based machine translation (MT) are
subject to often competing demands: on the one
hand, they need to abstract away from partic-
ulars of language specific surface realization to
ensure that transfer is as simple and straightfor-
ward as possible. On the other hand, they need
to encode sufficiently fine-grained information to
steer transfer. Furthermore, target and source
representations should be linguistically well es-
tablished and motivated levels of representa-
tion. Finally, from a computational perspective
they need to be sensible representations for both
parsing and generation. LFG f-structures are
abstract, &amp;quot;high-level&amp;quot; syntactic representations
which go some way towards meeting these of-
ten irreconcilable requirements.

Correspondence-based transfer on f-structures
has been proposed in (Kaplan et al., 1989).
A closer look at translation problems involv-
ing structural mismatches between languages —
in particular head switching phenomena (Sadler
and Thompson, 1991) — led to the contention
that transfer is facilitated at the level of seman-
tic representation, where structural differences
between languages are often neutralized. Struc-
tural misalignment is treated in semantics con-
struction involving a restriction operator (Ka-
plan and Wedekind, 1993) where f-structures are
related to (possibly sets of) disambiguated se-
mantic representations.
Given the high potential of semantic ambigui-
ties, the advantage of defining transfer on se-
mantic representations could well be counter-
balanced by the overhead generated by multi-
ple disambiguated structures as input to trans-
fer. This and the observation that many seman-
tic (and syntactic) ambiguities can be preserved
when translating into a target language that is
ambiguous in similar ways, sheds light on the
issue of the properties of representations for the
task of defining transfer.
In principle, the problem of semantic ambi-
guity in transfer can be tackled in a number
of ways. Packed ambiguity representation tech-
niques (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993) could be
integrated with the approach in (Kaplan and
Wedekind, 1993). In the linear logic based se-
mantics of (Dalrymple et al., 1996) scope am-
biguities are accounted for in terms of alterna-
tive derivations of meaning assignments from
a set of meaning constructors. Ambiguity pre-
serving semantic transfer can be devised on
sets of meaning constructors rather than dis-
ambiguated meanings (Genabith et al., 1998).

in (Emele and Dorna, 1998).
In the present paper we consider alternative ap-
proaches to transfer on underspecified — syntac-
tic or semantic — representations, focusing on is-
sues of modularity, reusability and practicality,
interfacing existing implemented approaches in
a flexible way. At the same time, the propos-
als readdress the issue of what is an appropriate
level of representation for translation, in view of
the known problems engendered by structural
mismatches and semantic ambiguity.
We first show how the underlying machinery
of the semantic-based transfer approach de-
veloped in Dorna and Emele (1996b) can be
ported to syntactic f-structure representations.
Second, we show how the underspecified seman-
tic interpretation approach developed in Gen-
abith and Crouch (1997) can be exploited to in-
terface f-structure representations directly with
the named semantic-based transfer approach.
Third, we compare the two approaches with
each other, and with co-description and restric-
tion operator based approaches.

This section presents a simple bidirectional
translation between LFG f-structures and term
representations which serve as input to and
output of a transfer component developed
within the Verbmobil project (Dorna and Emele,
1996a). The term representation is inspired by
earlier work (Kay et al., 1994; Caspari and
Schmid, 1994) which uses terms as a quasi-
semantic representation for transfer and gener-
ation.
The translation between f-structures and terms
is based on the correspondence between directed
graphs representing f-structures and the func-
tional interpretation of these graphs (cf. (John-
son, 1991)). Given an arc labeled f which con-
nects two nodes n1 and n2 in a graph, the same
can be expressed by a function f(n1) = n2. An
f-structure is the set of such feature equations
describing the associated graph. Instead of fea-
ture equations f (ni) = n2 we use the relational
notation f (ni, n2).
Using this idea f-structures can be converted
into sets of terms and vice versa.1 F-structure

FRED features and their &amp;quot;semantic form&amp;quot; values
are given special treatment. Instead of introduc-
ing FRED terms we build unary relations with
the semantic form predicate name as functor
(see Example (1)). The resulting representation
is similar to a Neo-Davidsonian style event se-
mantics (Parsons, 1991) but uses syntactic roles.

respondence see Appendix A.

Consider the simple head switching example in-

the English verb like (see (lb) and (3b)). (la)

tence (1b).2 (1c) is the set of terms representing
(1a).
Transfer works on source language (SL) and tar-
get language (TL) sets of terms representing
predicates, roles, etc. like the ones shown in (1c).
The mapping is encoded in transfer rules as in
(2). For a rule to be applied, the set on the SL
side must be a matching subset of the SL input
set. If this is the case, we remove the covering
set from the input and add the set on the other
side of the rule to the TL output. Transfer is
complete, if the SL set is empty.

The head switching rule (2d) shows two compo-

of # is a test on a copy of the original input. The
test binds the variable I&apos; at runtime when ap-

direction (and in general), TL tests are ignored.
Applying the rule set in (2) to (1c), we get
(3c). We now use the correspondence between f-
structures and term representations to construct
the TL f-structure. The result is (3a) represent-
ing the English sentence (3b).

3 Semantic Transfer
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999731375">
Semantic-based transfer as detailed in (Dorna
and Emele, 1996a; Dorna and Emele, 1996b)
is based on rewriting underspecified seman-
tic representations. The representations (Bos et
al., 1996) are UDRS variants (Reyle, 1993).
F-structures are abstract syntactic representa-
tions. They do, however, encode basic predicate—
argument relations, and this is essentially se-
mantic information. It turns out that there
are important structural similarities between
f-structures and UDRSs: f-structures can be
&amp;quot;read&amp;quot; as UDRSs and hence be assigned an
underspecified truth-conditional interpretation
(Genabith and Crouch, 1997).3 Appendix B
gives a relational formulation of the corre-
spondence between f-structures and UDRSs.
The UDRS representations are processed by
semantic-based transfer. The resulting system is
bi-directional. Consider again the simple head
switching case discussed in (1) and (3) above.
(4) shows the corresponding UDRSs.
The structural mismatch between the two f-
structures has disappeared on the level of UDRS
representations and transfer is facilitated.4

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982456">
We have presented two alternative architectures
for transfer in LFG. In both cases, transfer is
driven by the transfer module developed and
implemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a). In
the case of syntactic transfer, transfer is de-
fined on term representations of f-structures. In
the case of semantic transfer, transfer is de-
fined on UDRS translations of f-structures. F-
structure, term and UDRS correspondences are
defined in the Appendix. The transfer rules are
bi-directional, as are the f-structure—term and
f-structure—UDRS correspondences.
Co-description based approaches (Kaplan and
Wedekind, 1993) require annotation of source
and target lexica and grammars. By contrast,
both approaches presented here support mod-
ular grammar development: they don&apos;t involve
additional coding in the grammar specifications.
An important issue, noted above, is the problem
of ambiguities and ambiguity preserving trans-
fer. F-structures and UDRSs are underspecified
syntactic and semantic representations, respec-
tively. Both support ambiguity preserving trans-
fer to differing degrees (NP scope, operators,
adjuncts). F-structure based syntactic represen-

tations may come up against structural mis-
matches in transfer. The original co-description
based approach in (Kaplan et al., 1989) faced
problems when it came to examples involving
embedded head-switching and multiple adjuncts
(Sadler and Thompson, 1991), which led to the
introduction of a restriction operator, to en-
able transfer on partial f-structures or semantic
structures (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993). One
might suppose that the need to refer to partial
structures is an artifact of the correspondence-
based approach, which doesn&apos;t allow the map-
ping from a single node of the source f-structure
to distinct nodes in the target f-structure with-
out violation of the functional property of the
T correspondence. On closer inspection, though,
the rewriting approach to syntactic f-structure-
term translations presented above suffers from
the very same problems that were met by the
correspondence-based approach in (Kaplan et
al., 1989).
By contrast, transfer on the semantic UDRS
representations does not suffer from such prob-
lems. Head switching is dealt with in the con-
struction of semantic representations. Under-
specified semantic representations in the form of
UDRSs (or related formalisms) offer the follow-
ing advantanges for transfer: they abstract away
from cross-language configurational variation to
facilitate transfer. Unlike the original restric-
tion operator approach (Kaplan and Wedekind,
1993) whenever possible they avoid the detour
of multiple transfer on disambiguated represen-
tations. At the same time they provide a flexible
encoding of information essential to steer trans-
fer.
Of course, semantics does not come for free nor
does it always blend as seamlessly with syntac-
tic representations as one would hope for. Se-
mantics has to be encoded in the grammar or
defined in terms of correspondences as below.
System design has to address the question where
to do what at which cost. Semantic representa-
tions pay off when they are useful for a num-
ber of tasks: evaluation (as against a database),
inference and transfer. Even more so when ex-
isting resources can be interfaced qua semantic
representations: in our case the tested transfer
methodology and resources developed in (Dorna
and Emele, 1996a).

The term representation is inspired by earlier work (Kay et al., 1994; Caspari and Schmid, 1994) which uses terms as a quasisemantic representation for transfer and generation. The translation between f-structures and terms is based on the correspondence between directed graphs representing f-structures and the functional interpretation of these graphs (cf. (Johnson, 1991)). Given an arc labeled f which connects two nodes n1 and n2 in a graph, the same can be expressed by a function f(n1) = n2. An f-structure is the set of such feature equations describing the associated graph. Instead of feature equations f (ni) = n2 we use the relational notation f (ni, n2).

This and the observation that many semantic (and syntactic) ambiguities can be preserved when translating into a target language that is ambiguous in similar ways, sheds light on the issue of the properties of representations for the task of defining transfer. In principle, the problem of semantic ambiguity in transfer can be tackled in a number of ways. Packed ambiguity representation techniques (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993) could be integrated with the approach in (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993). In the linear logic based semantics of (Dalrymple et al., 1996) scope ambiguities are accounted for in terms of alternative derivations of meaning assignments from a set of meaning constructors. Ambiguity preserving semantic transfer can be devised on sets of meaning constructors rather than disambiguated meanings (Genabith et al., 1998).

With (14) the head switching — multiple adjunct interaction is correctly resolved in semanticbased transfer. Similarly, in syntactic transfer, the precedence constraint (13) can be used to steer translation to f-structure (8b). 5 Discussion We have presented two alternative architectures for transfer in LFG. In both cases, transfer is driven by the transfer module developed and implemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a). In the case of syntactic transfer, transfer is defined on term representations of f-structures. In the case of semantic transfer, transfer is defined on UDRS translations of f-structures. Fstructure, term and UDRS correspondences are defined in the Appendix. The transfer rules are bi-directional, as are the f-structure—term and f-structure—UDRS correspondences. Co-description based approaches (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) require annotation of source and target lexica and grammars. By contrast, both approaches presented here support modular grammar development: they don&apos;t involve additional </context>

Correspondence-based transfer on f-structures has been proposed in (Kaplan et al., 1989). A closer look at translation problems involving structural mismatches between languages — in particular head switching phenomena (Sadler and Thompson, 1991) — led to the contention that transfer is facilitated at the level of semantic representation, where structural differences between languages are often neutralized. Structural misalignment is treated in semantics construction involving a restriction operator (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) where f-structures are related to (possibly sets of) disambiguated semantic representations. Given the high potential of semantic ambiguities, the advantage of defining transfer on semantic representations could well be counterbalanced by the overhead generated by multiple disambiguated structures as input to transfer. This and the observation that many semantic (and syntactic) ambiguities can be preserved when translating into a target language that is ambiguous in similar ways, sheds light on the issue of the properties of representations for the task of defining transfer.

In both cases, transfer is driven by the transfer module developed and implemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a). In the case of syntactic transfer, transfer is defined on term representations of f-structures. In the case of semantic transfer, transfer is defined on UDRS translations of f-structures. Fstructure, term and UDRS correspondences are defined in the Appendix. The transfer rules are bi-directional, as are the f-structure—term and f-structure—UDRS correspondences. Co-description based approaches (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) require annotation of source and target lexica and grammars. By contrast, both approaches presented here support modular grammar development: they don&apos;t involve additional coding in the grammar specifications. An important issue, noted above, is the problem of ambiguities and ambiguity preserving transfer. F-structures and UDRSs are underspecified syntactic and semantic representations, respectively. Both support ambiguity preserving transfer to differing degrees (NP scope, operators, adjuncts).

By contrast, transfer on the semantic UDRS representations does not suffer from such problems. Head switching is dealt with in the construction of semantic representations. Underspecified semantic representations in the form of UDRSs (or related formalisms) offer the following advantanges for transfer: they abstract away from cross-language configurational variation to facilitate transfer. Unlike the original restriction operator approach (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) whenever possible they avoid the detour of multiple transfer on disambiguated representations. At the same time they provide a flexible encoding of information essential to steer transfer. Of course, semantics does not come for free nor does it always blend as seamlessly with syntactic representations as one would hope for. Semantics has to be encoded in the grammar or defined in terms of correspondences as below. System design has to address the question where to do what at which cost. Semantic representations pay off when they are useful for a number of tasks: evaluation (as against a datab</context>

Third, we compare the two approaches with each other, and with co-description and restriction operator based approaches. 2 Syntactic Transfer This section presents a simple bidirectional translation between LFG f-structures and term representations which serve as input to and output of a transfer component developed within the Verbmobil project (Dorna and Emele, 1996a).
