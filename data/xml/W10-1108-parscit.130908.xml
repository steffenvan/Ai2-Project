Abstract

We present a comparative study of Finnish
and Swedish free-text nursing narratives from
intensive care. Although the two languages
are linguistically very dissimilar, our hypothe-
sis is that there are similarities that are impor-
tant and interesting from a language
technology point of view. This may have im-
plications when building tools to support pro-
ducing and using health care documentation.
We perform a comparative qualitative analysis
based on structure and content, as well as a
comparative quantitative analysis on Finnish
and Swedish Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurs-
ing narratives. Our findings are that ICU nurs-
ing narratives in Finland and Sweden have
many properties in common, but that many of
these are challenging when it comes to devel-
oping language technology tools.

our research is to define linguistic similarities and
language-specific aspects that differentiate clinical
narratives in Finnish and Swedish in order to lay
groundwork for developing internationally appli-
cable language technology solutions and create a
framework for characterising and comparing clini-
cal narratives. Free text is handy for information
entry but a challenge for information extraction,
care handover and other uses of gathered informa-
tion. Language technology can alleviate some of
these problems in retrospective analysis by offer-
ing a more semantically informed interpretation
and abstraction. However, the most promising po-
tential of language technology is to interactively
improve, interpret and code during text entry so
that the resulting structured, coded, free text can be
validated immediately. The critical bottleneck to-
day is namely information handover and reuse, and
extensive text is simply not used nor is useful. In-
teractively validated, semantically processed text
could be more usable and support abstraction,
visualization and query tools for the benefit of cli-
nicians, patients, researchers and quality adminis-
trators.

In this paper, we analyze Finnish and Swedish
ICU nursing narratives from both qualitative and
quantitative perspectives. Our data includes textual
nursing documentation of adult patients with a
protracted inpatient period. We have chosen ICUs
because of their international similarity in decision
making (Lauri &amp; SalanterŠ 2002) and nursing
documentation because it covers the entire inpa-
tient period.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996988">
2.1 Clinical text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994476">
Clinical text covers the text documents produced
for clinical work by clinicians and occurs in clini-
cal information systems. It is written by clinicians,
that is, professionals (physicians, nurses, therapists
and other specialist) responsible for patient care.
Its primary purpose is to serve patient care as a
summary or hand-over note. However, clinical text
is also written for legal requirements, care continu-
ity and purposes of reimbursement, management
and research. Clinical text covers every care phase
and, depending on the purpose, documents differ.
Documents that describe the patient’s state, current
health problems and socio-medical history are very
different from those describing a care plan, its ac-
tualization and evaluation of care outcomes. Again,
these differ from diagnostic notes, lab results, ra-
diography readings, pathology reports and dis-
charge documents that plan further care at
discharge. Finally, clinical text may have been
entered in “real time”, in retrospect, or as a sum-
mary, by the bedside or elsewhere. The enterer can
be a clinician, secretary who transcribes a dictate,
speech recognition software or another system that
generates or synthesizes text, (McDonald 1997,
Thoroddsen et al., 2009.).

2.2 Legal requirements for clinical documen-
tation in different countries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945166666667">
In several countries clinical documentation is
based on law. In Finland, the Ministry of Social
Affairs and Health (Statutes of Finland, 298/2009)
defines that to ensure good care, all necessary and
wide-ranging information has to be registered in
patient records. In Sweden, the National Board of
Health and Welfare has a similar approach (Pa-
tientdatalagen 2008:355). Clinical text should be
explicit and intelligible, and only generally well-
known, accepted concepts and abbreviations are
allowed to be used. It should detail adequately the
patient’s conditions, care and recovery.

2.3 Special features of ICU and nursing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977564102564">
An ICU is an essential component of most large
hospitals with high quality care. ICUs provide
care for critically ill patients and focus on condi-
tions that are life-threatening and require compre-
hensive care and constant monitoring (Webster&apos;s
2010). This task is fairly similar universally. It is
based on optional, international guidelines focus-
ing on triage, admission, discharge and education.
This international similarity was evident when
nurses’ decision making was studied in Canada,
Finland, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, Norway
and the USA (Lauri &amp; SalanterŠ 2002); the study
showed that decision making of ICU nurses was
the most uniform in different countries when com-
pared with nurses working in public health care,
psychiatric care, and short and long term care.
Clinical text written by nurses, that is, nursing
narratives, both in Finland and in Sweden is based
on the care process which stands for gathering in-
formation from the patient, setting goals for care,
implementing nursing interventions, and evaluat-
ing the results of given care. In Finland, the na-
tional standardized documentation model has been
implemented with the Finnish care classification
(assessment, interventions and outcomes of care)
(Tanttu &amp; Ikonen 2007). The Swedish VIPS model
provides a structure for the documentation process
with key words that reflect the nursing process
(Ehrenberg et al., 1996).
ICU nursing narratives can be lengthy, espe-
cially when the patient stay in the ICU is pro-
longed. As much as 60 A4 pages equivalents of
written text may be gathered during one period of
care. However, clinicians have somewhat different
opinion on how to organize the information they
write. For example, headings are often inconsistent
and text under headings can cover a lot of other
issues than those directly concerning the given
heading. (Suominen et al., 2009.)

have taken place. This may include various topics,
from viewing detailed information about specific
items (e.g. readability, Kim et al., 2007) to identi-
fying patterns and structures in order to provide
better technology to automatically process the
sublanguage (Pakhomov et al., 2006). The majority
of such efforts investigate different aspects of lin-
guistic features at a monolingual level, for in-
stance, Hahn &amp; Wermter (2004); Tomanek et al.,
(2007); Chung (2009); Harkema et al., (2009);
while for a thorough review of various related is-
sues see Meystre et al., (2008). In the Nordic con-
text, Josefsson (1999) discusses Swedish clinical
language and shows examples on how verb con-
structions in a clinical setting differ from a non
clinical setting. One claim is that the physician
unmarks the verb forms for agentivity when writ-
ing about the patient and what actions she takes,
for example, Patienten hallucinerar [The patient
hallucinates] instead of the normal form Patienten
fdr hallucinationer [The patient experiences hallu-
cinations].
Helles¿ (2005) describes nurses&apos; general use of
the language function in the nursing discharge
notes. She finds that the text in the nursing dis-
charge notes is information-dense and character-
ized by technical terms, and that the use of
standardised templates helped nurses improve the
completeness, structure and content of the informa-
tion. Comparisons at a monolingual level between
written clinical text and lay text has been carried
out by Dalianis et al., (2009). A contrastive com-
putational linguistics study was carried out be-
tween the Stockholm EPR Corpus (SEPR) and a
general language corpus, both written Swedish
text. The findings showed that SEPR contained
longer words and that the vocabulary was highly
domain-specific. Other work is described in
Ownby, (2005). Comparing clinical text at a
crosslingual level has, to our knowledge, only been
done by Borin et al., (2007).

3 Analysis of Finnish and Swedish ICU
nursing narratives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981833333333">
The analyzed nursing narratives origin from one
ICU in a university-affiliated hospital both in Fin-
land and Sweden. Our inclusion criterion was an
ICU inpatient period of at least 5 days and patient&apos;s
age of at least 16 years. The Finnish data includes
nursing narratives from 514 patient records (496
unique patients, 18 rebounds, a patient record is
defined as each inpatient period of at least 5 days
per patient) between January 2005 and August
2006. The Swedish data includes nursing narra-
tives from 379 patient records (333 unique pa-
tients, 46 rebounds) between January 2006 and
May 2008. Since we did not have complete admis-
sion and discharge documents from both countries,
our analysis is performed on daily nursing narra-
tives. These documents are written by ICU nurses
during the actual inpatient period from the patient
admission to the discharge.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999969">
3.1 Qualitative analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987888888889">
A manual content analysis was performed by four
health care professionals (i.e., three native Finnish
speakers knowing Swedish, one Swedish native
speaker) and one native Swedish speaking lan-
guage consultant. Three average-sized patient re-
cords each from Finland and Sweden were chosen
for our analysis (average size 2,389 words for Fin-
land and 5,169 words for Sweden). In the analysis,
we considered special features (Table 1) of daily
notes both from the structural and content related
points of view.
The style and context of both Finnish and Swed-
ish text is very similar. For health care profession-
als, and especially with an ICU background, all the
texts are intelligible and the meaning of a writer
becomes evident from the context even in the pres-
ence of numerous linguistic and grammatical mis-
takes; almost all the sentences are lacking both
grammatical subjects and objects. It is evident that
in both countries, the narratives are written from a
professional to a professional in order to support
information transfer, remind about important facts,
and supplement numerical data.
A feature common for all the six records is that
they rarely contain any subjects or objects when
nurses are writing about patients. However, in the
Swedish nursing narratives the word patient is
used as a subject or object much more often than in
the Finnish narratives. The abbreviation pat. is
mostly used for this reference and she/he is never
used for this purpose. In the whole data, pat. is 40
percent more common than she/he, which is the
most common personal pronoun. It seems that the
word patient or pat. is used more when the profes-
sionals are writing about relatives. In general, pro-
nouns are used infrequently in the narratives, and

I very rarely. If the reader is not a health care pro-
fessional, a risk for confusing the subject (i.e., the
patient or nurse) arises. However, the context
makes it almost always clear who is referred to.
Approximately half of the narratives do not contain
any verb. The most common tense is perfect, but
without the auxiliary has. When the meaning does
not contain a subject it becomes “unnatural” to use
has. Instead, the supine form is used, for example
slept, lain, and eaten. Both present and past parti-
ciples without be-verb are common, for example,

<bodyText confidence="0.99961793939394">
The use of headings is frequent and good – most of
the time the content matches the headings (Tables
1 and 3). In addition, headings are used similarly in
the Swedish and Finnish documents. Most of the
time the headings are considered as subjects of the
sentence, for example, Consciousness: Unchanged.
Liquor brighter than yesterday.
However, in the use of headings there are two
interesting findings: If the headings are to be cho-
sen freely, as in the Finnish narratives, nurses tend
to use their own headings and hence many syno-
nyms or closely related concepts are used; for ex-
ample, hemodynamics versus blood pressure and
pulse or breathing versus oxidation. If the headings
are obligatory, as in the Swedish narratives, nurses
tend to write their observations under the heading
which is somehow closest to the subject; for exam-
ple, body temperature under circulation or level of
sedation under sleep.
For both languages the use of different abbrevia-
tions is very common. Almost every daily nursing
narrative included several abbreviations. Most of
the abbreviations are typical for an ICU domain:
CVP [central venous pressure], PEEP [Positive
End-Expiratory Pressure], EN [Enteral Nutrition],
TPN [Total Parenteral Nutrition], pO2 [partial
pressure of oxygen], pCO2 [partial pressure of
carbon dioxide], MV [Minute Ventilation] and
MAP [Mean Arterial Pressure]. From a language
technology point of view this means that ICU nurs-
ing narratives contain language-independent vo-
cabulary. However, nurses in both countries also
use many language dependent abbreviations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999957">
3.2 Quantitative analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998017261538461">
The Finnish data set (n=514) was quantitatively
analyzed using the morphological analyser FinT-
WOL and the disambiguator FinCG, (Lingsoft
2010), and the Swedish data set (n=379) using the
GTA, Granska Text Analyzer (Knutsson et al.,
2003). Both data sets are rich in terms of amount
of text and vocabulary (Table 2). It is also clear
that the amount of text written per day and patient
varies a lot in both data sets. More complex words
were spelled in numerous ways. For example, the
pharmacological substance Noradrenalin had ap-
proximately 350 and 60 different spellings in the
Finnish and Swedish data sets, respectively. This
problem is part of a more general issue of refer-
ence resolution e.g. when mapping different lexical
terms referring to the same concept.
In our quantitative analysis, we have included
punctuation characters. In the Swedish data there
was a large amount of html-tags and other format-
ting characters, which has a high impact on the
total number of tokens (see Table 2). Moreover, as
Finnish is highly inflective, FinCG produces alter-
native lemmas, hence it is possible to reduce the
sparseness of the data by processing the output by
choosing only one alternative lemma (see total
number of types in Table 2).
To further illustrate the richness of ICU nursing
language, the number of unique bigrams (e.g., “is
not”, “oxidate well” and “night time” (note: a mis-
spelled compound) are the most common ones for
Finnish) and trigrams (e.g., “oxygeneated and ven-
tilated”, “and ventilate well” are among the most
common ones for Finnish) were 368,166 (275,205
after FinCG) and 745,407 (356,307 after FinCG)
for Finnish patient records. For the Swedish data,
the number of unique bigrams was 469,455
(344,127 after GTA) and 1,064,944 (905,539 after
GTA). Examples of common Swedish ICU bi-
grams and trigrams include “circulation stabile”,
“during night”, “in connection with”, and “with
good effect”. Of the content of Finnish nursing
narratives, 11% are verbs, 7% nouns and less than
1% pronouns. For Swedish nursing narratives, the
respective percentages are 11%, 27% and 2%. One
reason for the high numbers for nouns in the Swed-
ish data might be due to the large amount of
(obligatory) headings relative to the Finnish data
(see Table 3).
To support fluent information flow, language
technology is needed to strengthen referential con-
gruence. Much of this richness of vocabulary is
explained by abbreviations and personal differ-
ences in professional jargon. In particular, abbre-
viations were common. Based on the analysis of
the most common words, abbreviations were rela-
tively established in Swedish data. For the Finnish
data, abbreviations were less standard but RR, SR,
CVP, h, ad, ml, ok, vas. [vasen, left] and oik.
[oikea, right] were extremely common. Thus, ref-
erential congruence can be strengthened by spell-
ing out the most common abbreviations
automatically.
Adding topical content headings is another way
to support information flow. Topical content head-
ings were mandatory for Swedish data, but no de-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996665">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870771929825">
fault headings for Finnish existed. However, the
headings for Finnish were established in terms of
content. In Table 3, we see that the headings for
both languages cover similar topics, which indi-
cates that the clinical information need is similar
for professionals in both countries (and languages).
Thus, we recommend forming a standardized set of
headings from which the user can voluntarily se-
lect the ones to be used. This does not exclude add-
ing other headings. Another alternative is to
develop language technology for topic segmenta-
tion and labeling. We have promising results from
this approach (see, e.g., Suominen 2009).
Temporal expressions (e.g., time, evening, night)
were often used in both data sets. This poses the
question of tense analysis of verbs being unneces-
sary and the time-related words being enough to
imply the needed temporal information. It is also
interesting to note that the negations inte [not,
Swe], ingen [none, Swe], ej [not, Swe] and ei
[no/not, Fin] are all among the most common
types, which is an important property to take into
account in information extraction applications.
Furthermore, words regarding the oral cavity, such
as breathing and mucus, as well as relations, such
as daughter, son, wife, and husband are very com-
mon in both data sets.
Inspired by the tf×idf-measure from information
retrieval, we also analyzed the most common
words in terms of a) the number of patients in
whose documents the word was used and b) the
number of daily nursing narratives in which the
word was used. Here, we found, in both data sets,
that those words that were used for all patients as
well as all daily narratives, were very similar in
both data sets, and were related to the most com-
mon headings, temporal expressions, negations and
monitoring (e.g., increase, continue, begin).
The amount of Protected Health Information
(PHI) in form of person names was equal in both
of the data sets: 1.5 person names per thousand
tokens. This is notable, since this has implications
when it comes to integrity issues and reuse of data
for research purposes.
FinCG did not recognize 36% of the content of
Finnish nursing narratives. However, words
marked as unrecognized by FinCG also included
punctuation marks. In our previous study (see
Suominen 2009 and references therein), we tai-
lored FinCG by extending approximately 35,000
clinical terms. The extension not only substantially
improved the applicability of FinCG to the health
domain but also initiated piloting of our language
technology components in an authentic healthcare
environment in the fall 2008. This lead to the re-
lease of commercial language technology for Fin-
nish health records (Lingsoft 2010).

For Swedish, GTA handles unknown words dif-
ferently than FinCG. However, by comparing the
ICU words with a Swedish general language cor-
pus (PAROLE, Gellerstam et al. (2000)), we found
that 69% of the types are not included in PAROLE,
which indicates a need for tailoring GTA (or simi-

<bodyText confidence="0.999984923076923">
The purpose of this study was to do content and
lexical analysis of nursing narratives written in an
ICU. Our findings are that, even though the Fin-
nish and Swedish languages are not linguistically
closely related, the way of writing clinical nursing
ICU narratives in both countries is very similar.
Moreover, the written context made sentences
clear for content experts, even though the texts
were full of specialized jargon, misspellings, ab-
breviations, and missing subjects and objects.
However, these characteristics make clinical text
challenging for language technology. For example
coreference resolution as in the case of noradrena-
lin.
We have also shown that the content characteris-
tics of Finnish and Swedish ICU nursing narratives
are very similar. This implies that developing tools
for documentation support in ICUs is not country
or language dependant in that respect. Developing
such tools may improve possibilities for informa-
tion extraction and text mining, enabling the possi-
bilities to reuse the vast amounts of important
practice-based information and evidence captured
in clinical narratives. The framework we have in-
troduced here could easily be employed in other
studies of clinical texts.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978277777778">
In the future, we will use the results of this study in
developing language technology for Finnish, Swe-
dish and other Nordic ICU narratives. We will
study how to identify abbreviations, misspellings
and normalize and correct them, by using various
distance measures and concept management tech-
niques. We will also study how to automatically
identify important parts of text and highlight them.
Furthermore, we are interested in studying text
provenance and pragmatics in this particular set-
ting. In addition, we will evaluate the influence of
these technology components in clinical practice.
We will also address similarities and differences in
clinical text written by various professional groups
or at other hospital wards and health care units.
Finally, we are eager to seek possibilities to incor-
porate laymen&apos;s information needs and their inter-
action with health care providers into our study.

Although the two languages are linguistically very dissimilar, our hypothesis is that there are similarities that are important and interesting from a language technology point of view. This may have implications when building tools to support producing and using health care documentation. We perform a comparative qualitative analysis based on structure and content, as well as a comparative quantitative analysis on Finnish and Swedish Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nursing narratives. Our findings are that ICU nursing narratives in Finland and Sweden have many properties in common, but that many of these are challenging when it comes to developing language technology tools.</abstract>

Clinical text written by nurses, that is, nursing narratives, both in Finland and in Sweden is based on the care process which stands for gathering information from the patient, setting goals for care, implementing nursing interventions, and evaluating the results of given care. In Finland, the national standardized documentation model has been implemented with the Finnish care classification (assessment, interventions and outcomes of care) (Tanttu &amp; Ikonen 2007). The Swedish VIPS model provides a structure for the documentation process with key words that reflect the nursing process (Ehrenberg et al., 1996). ICU nursing narratives can be lengthy, especially when the patient stay in the ICU is prolonged. As much as 60 A4 pages equivalents of written text may be gathered during one period of care. However, clinicians have somewhat different opinion on how to organize the information they write. For example, headings are often inconsistent and text under headings can cover a lot of other issues than those directly concerning the given heading.

Our data includes textual nursing documentation of adult patients with a protracted inpatient period. We have chosen ICUs because of their international similarity in decision making (Lauri &amp; SalanterŠ 2002) and nursing documentation because it covers the entire inpatient period. 2 Background 2.1 Clinical text Clinical text covers the text documents produced for clinical work by clinicians and occurs in clinical information systems. It is written by clinicians, that is, professionals (physicians, nurses, therapists and other specialist) responsible for patient care. Its primary purpose is to serve patient care as a summary or hand-over note. However, clinical text is also written for legal requirements, care continuity and purposes of reimbursement, management and research. Clinical text covers e</context>

ICUs provide care for critically ill patients and focus on conditions that are life-threatening and require comprehensive care and constant monitoring (Webster&apos;s 2010). This task is fairly similar universally. It is based on optional, international guidelines focusing on triage, admission, discharge and education. This international similarity was evident when nurses’ decision making was studied in Canada, Finland, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, Norway and the USA (Lauri &amp; SalanterŠ 2002); the study showed that decision making of ICU nurses was the most uniform in different countries when compared with nurses working in public health care, psychiatric care, and short and long term care. Clinical text written by nurses, that is, nursing narratives, both in Finland and in Sweden is based on the care process which stands for gathering information from the patient, setting goals for care, implementing nursing interventions, and evaluating the results of given care. In Finland, the national standardized documentation model has been implemented with the Finnish care classification (</context>

In Table 3, we see that the headings for both languages cover similar topics, which indicates that the clinical information need is similar for professionals in both countries (and languages). Thus, we recommend forming a standardized set of headings from which the user can voluntarily select the ones to be used. This does not exclude adding other headings. Another alternative is to develop language technology for topic segmentation and labeling. We have promising results from this approach (see, e.g., Suominen 2009). Temporal expressions (e.g., time, evening, night) were often used in both data sets. This poses the question of tense analysis of verbs being unnecessary and the time-related words being enough to imply the needed temporal information. It is also interesting to note that the negations inte [not, Swe], ingen [none, Swe], ej [not, Swe] and ei [no/not, Fin] are all among the most common types, which is an important property to take into account in information extraction applications. Furthermore, words regarding the oral cavity, such as breathing and mucus, as well as relations, such as daughte</context>

The amount of Protected Health Information (PHI) in form of person names was equal in both of the data sets: 1.5 person names per thousand tokens. This is notable, since this has implications when it comes to integrity issues and reuse of data for research purposes. FinCG did not recognize 36% of the content of Finnish nursing narratives. However, words marked as unrecognized by FinCG also included punctuation marks. In our previous study (see Suominen 2009 and references therein), we tailored FinCG by extending approximately 35,000 clinical terms.

In Finland, the national standardized documentation model has been implemented with the Finnish care classification (assessment, interventions and outcomes of care) (Tanttu &amp; Ikonen 2007). The Swedish VIPS model provides a structure for the documentation process with key words that reflect the nursing process (Ehrenberg et al., 1996). ICU nursing narratives can be lengthy, especially when the patient stay in the ICU is prolonged. As much as 60 A4 pages equivalents of written text may be gathered during one period of care.
