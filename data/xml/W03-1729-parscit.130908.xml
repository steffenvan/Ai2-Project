Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9995026875">
SYSTRAN’s Chinese word segmentation
is one important component of its
Chinese-English machine translation
system. The Chinese word segmentation
module uses a rule-based approach, based
on a large dictionary and fine-grained
linguistic rules. It works on general-
purpose texts from different Chinese-
speaking regions, with comparable
performance. SYSTRAN participated in
the four open tracks in the First
International Chinese Word Segmentation
Bakeoff. This paper gives a general
description of the segmentation module,
as well as the results and analysis of its
performance in the Bakeoff.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943794871795">
Chinese word segmentation is one of the pre-
processing steps of the SYSTRAN Chinese-
English Machine Translation (MT) system. The
development of the Chinese-English MT system
began in August 1994, and this is where the
Chinese word segmentation issue was first
addressed. The algorithm of the early version of
the segmentation module was borrowed from
SYSTRAN’s Japanese segmentation module. The
program ran on a large word list, which contained
600,000 entries at the time1. The basic strategy was
to list all possible matches for an entire linguistic
unit, then solve the overlapping matches via
linguistic rules. The development was focused on
technical domains, and high accuracy was
achieved after only three months of development.
Since then, development has shifted to other areas
of Chinese-English MT, including the enrichment
of the bi-lingual word lists with part-of-speech,
syntactic and semantic features. In 2001, the
development of a prototype Chinese-Japanese MT
system began. Although the project only lasted for
three months, some important changes were made
in the segmentation convention, regarding the
distinction between words and phrases 2 . Along
with new developments of the SYSTRAN MT
engine, the segmentation engine has recently been
re-implemented. The dictionary and the general
approach remain unchanged, but dictionary lookup
and rule matching were re-implemented using
finite-state technology, and linguistic rules for the
segmentation module are now expressed using a
context-free-based formalism, improving
maintainability. The re-implementation generates
multiple segmentation results with associated
probabilities. This will allow for disambiguation at
a later stage of the MT process, and will widen the
possibility of word segmentation for other
applications.

2.1 Segmentation Standard
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559">
Our definition of words and our segmentation
conventions are based on available standards,
modified for MT purposes. The PRC standard (Liu
et al., 1993) was initially used. Sample differences
are listed as follows:

2.2 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984074375">
The SYSTRAN Chinese word segmentation
module uses a rule-based approach and a large
dictionary. The dictionary is derived from the
Chinese-English MT dictionary. It currently
includes about 400,000 words. The basic
segmentation strategy is to list all possible matches
for a translation unit (typically, a sentence), then to
solve overlapping matches via linguistic rules. The
same segmentation module and the same
dictionary are used to segment different types of
text with comparable performance.
All dictionary lookup and rule matching are
performed using a low level Finite State
Automaton library. The segmentation speed is
3,500 characters per second using a Pentium 4
2.4GHZ processor.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.740137" genericHeader="method">
Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989906944444444">
The Chinese-English MT dictionary currently
contains 400,000 words (e.g., 中华), and 200,000
multi-word expressions (e.g., 中华 人民 共和国).
Only words are used for the segmentation.
Specialized linguistic rules are associated with the
dictionary. The dictionary is general purpose, with
good coverage on several domains. Domain-
specific dictionaries are also available, but were
not used in the Bakeoff.
The dictionary contains words from different
Chinese-speaking regions, but the representation is
mostly in simplified Chinese. The traditional
characters are considered as “variants”, and they
are not physically stored in the dictionary. For
example, 意 大 利 and 义 大 利 are stored in the
dictionary, and 義大利 can also be found via the
character matching 義→ 义.
The dictionary is encoded in Unicode (UTF8),
and all internal operations manipulate UTF8
strings. Major encoding conversions are supported,
including GB2312-80, GB13000, BIG-5, BIG5-
HKSCS, etc.
Training
The segmentation module has been tested and fine-
tuned on general texts, and on texts in the technical
and military domains (because of specific customer
requirements for the MT system). Due to the wide
availability of news texts, the news domain has
also recently been used for training and testing.
The training process is merely reduced to the
customization of a SYSTRAN MT system. In the
current version of the MT system, customization is
achieved by building a User Dictionary (UD). A
UD supplements the main dictionary: any word
that is not found in the main MT system dictionary
is added in a User Dictionary.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.768169">
Name-Entity Recognition and Unknown Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716181818182">
Name entity recognition is still under development.
Recognition of Chinese persons’ names is done via
linguistic rules. Foreign name recognition is not
yet implemented due to the difficulty of obtaining
translations.
Due to the unavailability of translations, even
when an unknown word has been successfully
recognized, we consider the unknown word
recognition as part of the terminology extraction
process. This feature was not integrated for the
Bakeoff.

2.3 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998034">
Our internal evaluation has been focused on the
accuracy of segmentation using our own
segmentation standard. Our evaluation process
includes large-scale bilingual regression testing for
the Chinese-English system, as well as regression
testing of the segmenter itself using a test database
of over 5MB of test items. Two criteria are used:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.912395">
1. Overlapping Ambiguity Strings (OAS): the
reference segmentation and the segmenter
segmentation overlap for some string, e.g.,
AB-C and A-BC. As shown below, this
typically indicates an error from our
segmenter.
2. Covering Ambiguity Strings (CAS): the test
strings that cover the reference strings
(CAS-T: ABC and AB-C), and the reference
strings that cover the test strings (CAS-R:
AB-C and ABC). These cases arise mostly
from a difference between equally valid
segmentation standards.
No evaluation with other standards had been done
before the Bakeoff.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.930467296296296">
SYSTRAN participated in the four open tracks in
the First International Chinese Word Segmentation
Bakeoff http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2003/. Each
track corresponds to one corpus with its own word
segementation standard. Each corpus had its own
segmentation standard that was significantly
different from the others. The training process
included building a User Dictionary that contains
words found in the training corpora, but not in the
SYSTRAN dictionary. Although each of these
corpora was segmented according to its own
standard, we made a single UD containing all the
words gathered in all corpora.
Although the ranking of the SYSTRAN
segmenter is different in the four open tracks,
SYSTRAN’s segmentation performance is quite
comparable across the four corpora. This is to be
compared to the scores obtained by other
participants, where good performance was
typically obtained on one corpus only. SYSTRAN
scores for the 4 tracks are shown in Table 3 (Sproat
and Emerson, 2003).

The majority of OAS divergences show incorrect
segmentation from SYSTRAN. However,
differences in CAS do not necessarily indicate
incorrect segmentation results. The reasons can be
categorized as follows: a) different segmentation
standards, b) unknown word problem, c) name
entity recognition problem, and d) miscellaneous4.
The distributions of the differences are further
analyzed in Table 5 and 6 for the ASo and PKo

This analysis shows that the segmentation results

for example the encoding of numbers using single

in the PKo corpus, which account for about 12% of

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999524333333333">
For an open track segmentation competition like
the Bakeoff, we need to achieve a balance between
the following aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995362076923077">
• Segmentation standards: differences between
one’s own standard and the reference standard.
• Adaptation to the other standards: whether one
should adapt to other standards.
• Dictionary coverage: the coverage of one’s
own dictionary and the dictionary obtained by
training.
• Algorithm: combination of segmentation,
unknown word identification, and name entity
recognition.
• Speed: the time needed to segment the corpora.
• Training: time and manpower used for training
each corpus and track
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789441176471">
Few systems participated in all open tracks:
only SYSTRAN and one university participated in
all four. We devoted about 2 person/week for this
evaluation. We rank in the top three of three open
tracks, and only the PKo track scores are lower,
probably because of encoding problems for
numbers for this corpus (we did not adjust our
segmenter to cope with this corpus-specific
problem). Our results are very consistent for all
open tracks, indicating a very robust approach to
Chinese segmentation.
Analysis of results shows that SYSTRAN’s
Chinese word segmentation excels in the area of
dictionary coverage, robustness, and speed. The
vast majority of divergences with the test corpora
originate from differences in segmentation
standards (over 55% for CAS-R and about 98% for
CAS-T). True errors range between 0% and 2%
only, the rest being assigned to either the lack of
unknown word processing or the lack of a name
entity recognizer. Although not integrated, the
unknown word identification and name entity
recognition are under development as part of a
terminology extraction tool.
For future Chinese word segmentation
evaluations, some of the issues that arose in this
Bakeoff would need to be addressed to obtain even
more significant results, including word
segmentation standards and encoding problems for
example. We would also welcome the introduction
of a surprise track, similar to the surprise track of
the DARPA MT evaluations that would require
participants to submit results within 24 hours on an
unknown corpus.
