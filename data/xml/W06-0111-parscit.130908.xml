BA-construction (‘ ’ ) is a special
syntactic structure in the Chinese language. It is
so frequently used in everyday conversations that
its usage can not be simply ignored. In fact, the
BA-construction has been greatly drawing the
attention of almost all linguists who are
interested in the Chinese language. The reason
for this concentrates not only on the fact that it is
a quite special Chinese linguistic phenomenon
but also that until now no consensus has been
reached among linguists on whether its
grammatical category belongs to that of a verb or
that of a preposition. Historically speaking, much
evidence shows that it was used more as a verb
than as a preposition. However, recent research
tends to classify the BA-construction to the
category of the prepositional phrase (PP), which
characterizes the pre-posed object (usually a
noun phrase – NP) of a transitive verb (Zhou and
PU, 1985). In the following sections we will first
introduce very briefly the different points of
view held by these linguists and then we will
demonstrate our choice for the study of the BA-
construction in our experimental English-
Chinese machine translation system, which is
based on the controlled language technique. We
will particularly stress the problems we face
when transferring certain English imperative
sentences into Chinese sentences containing the
BA-construction which is mandatory in some
cases, while this is optional in other cases, or can
be used as one of the other alternatives (between

The BA-construction refers to a special
grammatical structure in Mandarin
Chinese. It is an extremely important
syntactic structure in Chinese, which is
frequently used in daily life. The study of
the BA-construction has attracted the
attention of almost all linguists who are
interested in this language. Yet it is a
quite complex and difficult linguistic
phenomenon and it is hard to analyze it
satisfactorily to cope with the syntactic
structure(s) of another language which
does not possess this kind of construction
(e.g. in machine translation). This paper
discusses a few methods on how some of
the English imperative sentences are
realized by the Chinese BA-construction
which is mandatory in transferring
certain source language (SL) information
into target language (TL) in an
experimental machine translation (MT)
system. We also introduce the basic
syntactic structures of the BA-
construction and explain how we
formalize and control these structures to
satisfy our need. Some features related to
the BA-construction, such as
obligatoriness versus the optionality, the
semantics as well as the properties of the
elements preceding and following the BA
are also discussed. Finally we suggest
that by constraining the variations of the
formalized patterns of the BA-

a normal syntactic structure (V + NP + X1 ) and
the BA-construction (BA + NP + V + X).
2 The BA-Construction: a verb phrase
or a prepositional phrase?
It is important to note that we do not pretend
to give an overview of all kinds of points of view
on the study of the BA-construction here, nor do
we claim to justify all the different conceptions
held in the literature in this short paper. Instead,
we just try to verify how our practice with this
construction can be better formulated for our
specific purpose: to be well adapted to serve for
an English-Chinese MT system.
Whether the word BA ( ) in the BA-
construction is a verb or a preposition is an open
question in Chinese linguistics. Due to the
difficulty of having sufficient and strong
evidence to distinguish the BA-construction
between a verb and a preposition, some linguists
also call the BA and some other words which
possess the same property, such as BEI ( ) etc.,
a “coverb” ( , literally: a sub-
verb) which share the properties of both a verb
and a preposition. As a result of no consensus
among linguists, the analysis of this construction
is divided into two separate schools: that of a
verb phrase (VP) and that of prepositional phrase
(PP) or one that is more inclined to one of the
schools than the other. The first school of
linguists states that the BA-construction should
be considered as a VP whose surface structure
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4220275">
resembles a lot the serial-verb constructions (
) (Subj + V + (NP1+2 ) + V2 + (NP2) ...),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999311076923077">
(see example 1 b). Like a serial verb
construction, the first V can be represented by
the word BA and form a BA-construction. In
their opinion, the BA shows the characteristics of
the other parallel verbs which are used in the
serial-verb construction (refers to any surface
string with more than one verb in a sentence).
Furthermore, some features of the BA indicate
that the elements following the BA make up a
constituent in which the BA looks more like a
verbal head taking a complement (Bender, 2002),
(Hashimoto, 1971), (Ma, 1985), and (Her, 1990),
for example:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.477470333333333">
1 a)
1 X: a non-null variable, usually an adverb or a PP
2 +: refers to the possibility of more than one NP.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8957928">
I opened the door and went in to take a book.
One of their supporting points is that unlike a
prepositional phrase, the BA-construction can
not be moved to the beginning of the sentence,
for example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.57475">
c) *4 ,

(literal translation: In Beijing, he buy
LE(ASP) a BEN(CL) book)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.880584769230769">

Furthermore, like the other verbs, the BA can
be negated by MEIYOU ( ), for example (1
a):
(literal translation: Zhang San, MEIYOU6 ,
BA Li Si hit a punch, Wang Wu kick two foot)
Zhang San did not give Li Si a punch and
Wang WU two kicks.
In addition, like other monosyllable verbs,
the BA as a verb can be used as the attributive of
a noun by adding a structural word “DE ( ”
(STR7 ) between it and the noun, for example, “
” (read, DE, book; the book to read); “
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.884177666666667">
The second school of linguists claims that the
BA-construction is actually a prepositional
phrase with its head word followed by a NP
complement which is moved in front of the
transitive main verb in the sentence (See
example 4 a) below). Furthermore, though the
BA possesses the categorical features of a verb,
it is hard to qualify the BA to function alone as
the main verb or predicate in a sentence. In
addition, in Mandarin Chinese the aspect
attachments can be used as one of the conditions
to test the verbhood of a word. The fact is that in
most cases, if an aspect attachment, such as LE (
), GUO ( ) (expressing past actions) and
ZHE ( ) (expressing continuous actions), is
attached to the BA, the whole sentence will look
strange and become ungrammatical (see below in
b) and c)).

(literal translation: he, look, GUO, this book)
He read the book.
He is looking at the book.
Their point of view concerning this
construction is also supported by some
grammatical criteria to test the verbhood of a
word. For instance, most monosyllable verbs can
be duplicated as independent “AA” or “A A”
structures in Chinese, for example “ (see,
look)” as “ ” or “ ” “ (read)” as “
” or “ ”; “ (eat)”as “ ” or “
”; and “ (go or walk)” as “ ” or “
”
(some transitive verbs can be used this way
without objects, but the duplicated “ ” or “
” as a verb must have its object following it,
e.g. “ (make checks; to guard a pass,
etc.)” or “ ”). Furthermore the verb
following the BA-construction is a transitive
verb which in fact subcategorizes for (or still
governs) the pre-posed logical object (the
complement of the preposition BA) and the main
verb is usually accompanied by other auxiliary
constituents following or immediately preceding
it. In other words, the verb can not stand alone
after its object is moved in front of it (see in 6 a),
7 a) and 7 c)) in italics and in blue and the
ungrammatical sentences 6 c) and 7 d)). Besides,
Chinese is a thematic language, and the theme is
often placed in front of the other constituents in
the sentences accordingly. In many cases, we can
see that the BA-construction does have an effect
of emphasis on the semantic content that this
structure carries (see the comparisons between 6
a) and 6 b), and between 7 a) and 7 b)). We take
again the example (4), “He repeated what he had
said just now.”, and show it in (6) (HU, 1991).

patient object is shifted to the front of the main
verb and the BA structure functions as an adjunct
of the verb like many other adjuncts that are
often placed between the subject and the
predicate verb (HU, 1991). The reason for this
choice is that considering the BA-construction as
a PP is easier for the syntactic analysis and
formulation than taking it as a VP in a serial verb
construction.
Against this background, we will demonstrate
in the following section how we formalize the
BA-construction to cope with its English
counterpart imperative sentences in our work and
how these English sentences are finally
constructed into grammatical target Chinese
sentences containing the BA-structure.

both sentences (6 c and 7 d) become
ungrammatical. Therefore, the syntactic structure
of the second school can be analyzed as shown in
Figure 2 “BA as a Preposition”:

<bodyText confidence="0.9385855">
Schematically, a BA-construction always has
the following linear configurations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.638409">

<bodyText confidence="0.999983545454546">
where the sentence can have an optional (in
many cases) NP* as subject, followed by BA and
its NP complement, then followed by a
transitive V and another constituent X (which
might precede the verb as shown in (b), and
usually is an adverb or a prepositional phrase).
Concerning our own view, we adopt the idea
that the BA is a preposition with which the
The MT system we work with is oriented to
the automatic translation of medical protocols
selected from two sub-domains: echinococcosis
(clinical practice) and molecular cloning
(laboratory practice), where the predominant
sentence type is the imperative sentence. Due to
the fact that the BA-construction is mandatory in
transferring some of the information conveyed in
these SL sentences, we have formalized some
English sentences into Chinese counterpart
sentences containing the BA-construction. To do
this, we compare carefully each of the sentence
pairs in both languages from a parallel bilingual
corpus which we have constructed for our
research. In this way, we obtained enough
evidence to support the formalization of this
special Chinese construction for our MT system.
Though the BA-construction is a very productive
structure from which we can derive many
varieties in Mandarin Chinese, our observation
of the corpus reveals that the variations are
limited but nevertheless indispensable for
formulation.
As we have mentioned in the above paragraph,
we have constructed a parallel bilingual corpus
for an experimental MT system for the purpose
of automatic translation of medical protocols
which are from two different sources: one is on
echinococcosis, a kind of transmissible disease
shared by humans and animals, and the other is
on molecular cloning. Like many other scientific
documents, the medical texts we collected show
a high degree of homogeneity in respect of the
text structure and lexical usage, but often we find
very long and structurally complicated sentences
which are difficult to analyze or to be formally

represented. To narrow down the linguistic
difficulty, we adopt the controlled language
technique as a supporting method (CARDEY, et
al. 2004), (WU, 2005). In other words, we first
make the raw text materials simpler and easier
for the computer to process, for example, to
standardize the general structure of the text, the
terminology, and to constrain the lexical usages
and the sentence structures, which allows us to
avoid many complex linguistic phenomena and
which helps us to design practical controlled
writing rules. Controlled language has been
proved to be very feasible in machine translation
by many systems, e.g. KANT (NYBERG &amp;
TERUKO, 1996). With the simpler and clearer
input source sentences, the machine can
generally produce better output target sentences.
We finally work with our already well-
controlled final texts for linguistic analysis which
is based on unification-based grammar.
According to our observation, the English
sentences which have to be transferred into
Chinese sentences containing the BA-
constructions are of two types, of which one is
obligatory and the other is optional (with the BA-
construction or no). The typical feature of these
kinds of sentences is that the main verb in the
sentence often indicates a kind of change or
movement; therefore, in both the source and
target sentence the goal or location of this change
or movement is represented by a prepositional
phrase, for example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967009">
8) Insert a catheter in the cyst.
9) Store the tube on the ice.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996493">
The syntactic structure of this kind of sentence
in the SL can be represented as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.969088">
S VP
VP V NP PP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997034">
and we get two basic formulae by applying
predicate-argument generation for example 8 and
9:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8294695">
Insert (_, Compl1, in_Compl2)
Store (_, Compl1, on_Compl2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99553425">
“_” refers to the position of the verb which may
vary accordingly.
From the aligned TL sentence, we can
formulate the TL sentence as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.98236">
S VP
VP PP1 V PP2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996684">
”,
for the reason that it is more convenient if we
lexicalize a Chinese equivalent for the English
preposition “in” in the Chinese translation at the
cost that it is a bit redundant in the TL sometimes,
but completely grammatical and acceptable. Our
principle here is that every word should have its
status in the sentence. So whenever it is possible
and, in particular acceptable in the TL, we assign
a correspondence to the SL preposition (or other
words like adverbs or NP as adjunct) in the TL.
By doing so, the machine can have a better
performance in most cases. It is particularly
beneficial for bi-directional MT. The
correspondence of a SL preposition is mostly
composed of two Chinese characters in the
structure of “X ... Y”, of which “...” is the
position of the complement of the preposition in
question. The second element “Y” is usually
considered as a noun indicating the direction or
location in Chinese. However, in our case, we
consider it as a disjoint part of the first
preposition “X”. In other words, the “X...Y”
structure is considered as one language unit in
our practice. The lexicalization of a prepositional
phrase in the TL is also one of our criteria to test
if a sentence has to be constructed with the BA-
structure or not. Most importantly this practice
can reduce the workload of writing too many
grammatical rules for the system, for example
when a preposition has to be translated into
Chinese and when it needs not to, etc.
Like most of the English imperative sentences,
the Chinese counterpart sentences start with
verbs. However, in some cases, the BA-
construction is also employed. Generally
speaking, many of the sentences can be used in
both ways: to start with a verb or start with the
BA-construction. They do not make big
differences in general. However, semantically
the sentences starting with a verb tend to be more
narrative while the BA-construction is more firm
and authoritative in expressing the ideas, for
example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.671321">
10) Store the tube on the ice.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992175">
in which the first PP is the BA-structure and the
second PP corresponds to the PP in the SL.
Therefore we get two corresponding formulae for
example 8 and 9 in the TL respectively:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9995945">
(BA_Compl1, _, _Compl2_ )
(BA_Compl1, _, _Compl2_ )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998667">
In fact, for example 8 the Chinese translation
can leave out the second preposition “ ... ( )

<bodyText confidence="0.98915752173913">
The protocols we work with are instructions of
certain step-by-step procedures of either clinical
practice or laboratory practice, just like product
use instructions, recipes and user’s manuals. The
semantic contents of these sentences should be
firmly expressed as kinds of orders. Though both
pairs of the Chinese sentences (10 and 11) are
transferring the same idea, the BA-construction
is more expressive and natural in this case
(example 10 a) and 11 a).
In our corpus, we have observed that some of
the English imperative sentences can be
transferred into two kinds of BA-construction,
that of obligatory and that of optional.
Obligatoriness:
In our work, some sentences must be
constructed into Chinese BA-structure, otherwise,
the whole sentence sounds either ungrammatical
(see in c below) or unnatural or especially
unacceptable (see in b below). The
grammaticality of the sentence can be tested by
moving the translated SL PP to the front of the
sentence in the TL (see in c)), for example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90929">
12 a) Inject contrast medium into the cyst.
(unacceptable)
c) *
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.907899363636364">
As is shown in (c), if the whole sentence
becomes ungrammatical after moving the PP in
front of the sentence, we classify the sentence as
obligatory to be transferred into to a TL sentence
containing the BA-structure. We then constrain
the syntactic structure to the first one as the legal
structure while excluding the other two, thus the
formulations are:
insert (_, Compl1, into_Compl2)
(BA_Compl1, _, _Compl2_ )
The other two are excluded:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.3933212">
(_, Compl1, _Compl2_ )
(unacceptable)
9 Note: the BA is underlined; the verb is in bold font;
and the object (logical) is in italic.
10 Red: refer the translated SL PP in TL.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.945231875">
* ( _Compl2_ , _, Compl1)
Notice that though the first excluded
formulation in the TL shares the same structure
as that of the SL, they are unacceptable in the TL.
The same situation applies to the following two
examples:
13 a) Leave the contrast medium in the cyst as
a substitute of protoscolicide agent.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.603219666666667">

,
(ungrammatical)
c) *
(strange and ungrammatical)
The final formulation is based on (a):
Leave (_, Compl1, in_Compl2, X)
(X, BA_Compl1, _, _Compl2_ )
The other two are excluded:
* (X, _, Compl1, _Compl2_ )
* (X, _Compl2_ , _, Compl1,)
14 a) Leave the inserted catheter in the cyst for
1-3 days.
Alternative:

(ungrammatical)
Note: for (b) a better alternative should be:

acceptable sentence)
The final legal formulations are:
Leave (_, Compl1, in_Compl2, T)
(BA_Compl1, _, _Compl2_ , T)
The alternatives (in a) and b)) will be excluded
as long as the first one (a) is a perfectly
acceptable sentence. Unlike the “X” in example
(13 and 14), here the “T” refers to adjuncts
which refers to TIME and which usually
occupies a different position in the sentence in
our case.
Therefore our criterion to test the
obligatoriness is to see what kind of grammatical
performance a sentence will exhibit when it is
used in the form shown in the above (b’s and c’s,
especially in (c’s)). If the sentence looks

unacceptable or is in particular ungrammatical,
then it must be constructed into the TL sentence
containing the BA-structure. This phenomenon is
in fact closely related with the semantic contents
of the verb and as well as the preposition (a goal
or a location) in question (we will not discuss
this aspect in this paper).
Optionality
Some sentences that we have observed can be
used optionally. That is to say, we can transfer
the SL sentences without employing the BA-
construction, or with the BA-construction in the
TL. In doing so, no significant loss of the
sentence meaning will occur (except that in some
cases there still exist the semantic differences
where a BA-construction exhibits firmness and
authority), for example:

Here “Y” refers to adverbs.
However, if the transitive verb (e.g. “vortex”)
is used intransitively as is often the case in our
corpus, the BA-construction has to be changed to
the normal sentence structure (V + (X) + PP), for
example:
17) Vortex gently for a few seconds.
Formulation for this becomes:
Vortex (_, Y, T)
(Y, _, T)
The reason why we allow the alternative
formulations in the second case is that these
sentences are actually subcategorized for by the
verbs and will not be confused with other similar
syntactic structures (e.g. V + NP + PP) which do
not employ the BA-construction in the TL while
transferring the intended information. We
demonstrate this with an example:
18 a) Puncture the cyst with the needle.
While the machine is searching the
information concerning this sentence, two major
supported sources of information (lexicon and
grammar rules) will help it find the correct
structure for transferring the sentence into the
correct TL correspondence. Therefore, the
machine will not mismatch the syntactic
structure for this sentence by wrongly employing
the BA-construction, for example the following
translation will be excluded by both the
information stored in the lexicon and grammar as
a legal instruction:

<equation confidence="0.736137">
b) *
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977214285714">
This is an understandable but very unnatural
sentence and can be regarded as ungrammatical
in the target language. Though it possesses the
same structure as that of the other BA-
construction, the problem of this
ungrammaticality is caused by the semantic
content conveyed by both the verb and the
preposition. Usually a BA-construction expresses
the resultative or directional effect of the verb.
However, what the PP “with the needle”
expresses is the manner of the verb, that is, how
the action is done. Semantically, it is not within
the semantic scope of the BA-construction
(though we can find few contradictory examples)

and thus can not be translated into to the target
language by incorrectly employing the BA-
construction.
In our system prepositional phrases like, “with
the needle” is subcategorized by the verb
“puncture” and the syntactic rules for this verb.
To demonstrate this, we simplify the lexical and
syntactic information as shown in the formula
below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.764754">
Puncture (_, Compl1, with_Compl2)
( _Compl2, _, Compl1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950925">
The above information tells us that the verb
“puncture” of the source language, like the other
verbs mentioned in the previous paragraphs, can
have two complements, of which one has a
preposition as the head of the second linear
complement. The correspondence in the target
language for this verb is “ ” which take two
complements too. One corresponds to the first
complement of the SL and is placed after the
verb “ ”, and the other complement
corresponds to the second complement but is
placed in front of the verb with a preposition as
its head “ ”. The simplified syntactic structures
for both sentences are:
SL: V_311 (_, A, P_B)
TL: V_3 (P_B, _, A)

4 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999834523809524">
In this paper we have discussed a special
Chinese syntactic structure: the BA-construction
which is quite controversial in the literature but
nevertheless less problematic in our work. After
comparing with other syntactic structures, we
finally adopt the idea that the BA-construction
shows more characteristics of a PP which is still
governed by the verb which follows it, in
particular in our work. We thus treat this
structure as a PP rather than a VP. This is
supported by the relatively simpler sentence
structures found in our corpus. While
constructing our grammar and formulating the
BA-structure, we lay focus on the syntactic
performance and semantic contents that the BA-
construction exhibits. Based on the verb types
and the semantic content of the preposition
following the verb, we finally formulate two
kinds of sentence types concerning the BA-
construction in the target language which can
well satisfy our purpose. Of course, like many

other language-specific syntactic structures, our
analysis and practice can not satisfy all situations.
However, as we work on a relatively narrow
domain where the sentence types by themselves
do not vary greatly. We can find a better solution
by controlling the syntactic types to tackle the
problems concerning the BA-construction and
the alike.

To narrow down the linguistic difficulty, we adopt the controlled language technique as a supporting method (CARDEY, et al. 2004), (WU, 2005). In other words, we first make the raw text materials simpler and easier for the computer to process, for example, to standardize the general structure of the text, the terminology, and to constrain the lexical usages and the sentence structures, which allows us to avoid many complex linguistic phenomena and which helps us to design practical controlled writing rules. Controlled language has been proved to be very feasible in machine translation by many systems, e.g. KANT (NYBERG &amp; TERUKO, 1996).
