Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.986807761904762">
Medical concepts in clinical reports can be
found with a high degree of variability of ex-
pression. Normalizing medical concepts to
standardized vocabularies is a common way
of accounting for this variability. One of the
challenges in medical concept normalization
is the difficulty in comparing two concepts
which are orthographically different in repre-
sentation but are identical in meaning. In this
work we describe a method to compare medi-
cal phrases by utilizing the information found
in syntactic dependencies. We collected a
large corpus of radiology reports from our
university medical center. A shallow semantic
parser was used to identify anatomical phras-
es. We performed a series of transformations
to convert the anatomical phrase into a norma-
lized syntactic dependency representation.
The new representation provides an easy in-
tuitive way of comparing the phrases for the
purpose of concept normalization.

A vast amount of electronic information is
generated in hospitals as a part of routine clinical
care due to the adoption of the electronic medical
record by health care centers in the United States
(Berner et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2006). A significant
portion of this information is in the form of un-
structured free-text (Hall, 2000; Tange et al.,

for applications to accurately extract medical in-
formation for generic purposes (Ananiadou et al.,
2004). The problem of variability of expression in
natural language expression has been well studied
(Bates, 1986, 1989, 1998; Blair and Maron, 1985;
Funk and Reid, 1983; Furnas et al., 1984; Gomez
et al., 1990). In the medical domain in particular,
users frequently express the same concept in dif-
ferent ways and different concepts in similar ways
(Ananiadou and Nenadic, 2006). To illustrate, the
terms heart attack and cardiac attack both refer to
the same concept — myocardial infarction. Con-
versely the term left lobe could refer to the left lobe
of lung or the left lobe of liver depending on the
context (occurrence in a chest radiology report ver-
sus a gastro-intestinal radiology report). Such va-
riability suggests a need to normalize concepts
encountered in medical reports to a standard voca-
bulary in order to ensure interoperability.
Several standardized vocabularies exist in the
medical domain such as the Unified Medical Lan-
guage System (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993),
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical
Terms (College of American Pathologists, July
2003), Medical Subject Headings (National Li-
brary of Medicine), and the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases (World Health Organization).
There have been several attempts in the past
(Aronson, 2001; Bashyam and Taira, 2005; Ba-
shyam et al., 2007; Cooper and Miller, 1998;
Friedman et al., 2004; Nadkarni et al., 2001; Oliv-
er and Altman, 1994; Ruch et al., 2003; Zou et al.,
2003) to map medical concepts to their standar-
dized concept found in these terminologies. These
approaches are based on mostly on lexical match-
ing (Bashyam et al., 2007), string matching (Nad-
karni et al., 2001), statistical indexing (Cooper and

Oliver and Altman, 1994; Ruch et al., 2003; Zou et
al., 2003) or a combination of these approaches
(Cooper and Miller, 1998). These systems have
managed to map a large percentage of medical
terms to their respective standard terminologies in
their reported experiments. While these systems
have managed to perform satisfactorily for the task
of normalizing simple expressions, they all ac-
knowledge the larger problem of normalizing leng-
thy expressions. To illustrate, Nadkarni et al.
(2001) mention the mapping of the phrase spleen
rupture and normal stomach to the concept sto-
mach rupture as a possible spurious mapping.
We hypothesize that using deep syntactic in-
formation can help in avoiding such spurious map-
ping. We describe a system which uses information
found in syntactic dependencies to help in the cod-
ing of lengthy phrases. Preliminary results using
this approach are reported as a proof-of-concept.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976724137931">
Syntactic dependency parsing has received
much focus from the natural language processing
community (Eisner, 1996; Kudo and Matsumoto,
2000; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Yamada and Mat-
sumoto, 2003). A syntactic dependency relation is
an asymmetric relation between two words. One
word is called the head, and the other word is
called the modifier or dependent. A word in the
sentence can play the role of the head in several
dependency relations (i.e., it can have several mod-
ifiers) but each word can play the role of the mod-
ifier only once. A special word, named the root,
does not play the role of the modifier in any rela-
tion. The set of dependency relations that can be
defined on a sentence form a tree, called the de-
pendency tree. An example of dependencies in a
typical sentence found in a radiology report is
shown in Figure 1.
Systems based on syntactic dependencies have
been used successfully in several information re-
trieval experiments with results outperforming tra-
ditional retrieval systems (Croft et al., 1991; Gao
et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Smeaton,
1986). In particular, this method has been used for
word sense disambiguation (Lin, 1997) and thesau-
rus construction (Lin, 1998). Dependency trees
have also been used for medical concept represen-
tation in the domains of radiology (Steimann,
1998) and pathology (Romacker et al., 1999).

3.1 Anatomy Phrase Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999498066666667">
For identifying anatomy phrases, we use a spe-
cialized phrase parser trained to identify anatomy
phrases within clinical reports. The input to the
parser is a sentence tagged with a part-of-speech
tag and a semantic tag. The lexical analyzer mod-
ule of our NLP system takes a single sentence as
the input and produces an output of word tokens
tagged with their syntactic and semantic classes.
The semantic tag is obtained by mapping tokens in
a sentence to a taxonomy handcrafted for the do-
main of radiology reports custom built from radi-
ology textbooks, radiology review manuals,
radiology word compilations and published radiol-
ogy glossaries apart from actual radiology reports
(Taira et al., 2001). Features of our implementation

include: 1) a large number (&gt;450) of semantic
classes as compared to lexical sources currently
available allowing improved discrimination for
tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic interpre-
tation and frame building; 2) the system recognizes
special symbols including dates, medical abbrevia-
tions, medical coding symbols, numeric measure-
ments, image slice references, and proper names;
and 3) the system performs some word sense dis-
ambiguation using surrounding syntactic and se-
mantic word features.
Our phrase parsing module currently targets
anatomy phrases (e.g., right upper lobe of lung),
existential relationships (e.g., there is no evidence
of), and spatial relationships (e.g., is located Icm
above). We utilize a supervised learning approach
to estimate the feature weights to a maximum en-
tropy model which classifies words as the start,
inside, end, single, or outside of a phrase boundary.
A Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm is used
to maximize the tag sequence probability. The
anatomy phrase chunker has been tested on 4,500
sentences with recall and precision scores of 97.1%
and 97.4% respectively.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999252">
3.2 Normalized Dependency Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992286">
We perform a series of transformations to con-
vert an anatomical phrase from a free-text repre-
sentation to a normalized dependency vector space
representation. The following steps are taken in the
representation conversion:

Syntactic Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973846153846">
The anatomy phrase identified by the phrase
parser preserves lexical information which is used
to obtain a dependency parse tree using a full syn-
tactic parser. This parser is based on a novel field
theory approach to dependency parsing. The parser
is strongly modeled for the radiology domain with
performance accuracies of 84.9% and 89.9% for
link precision and recall respectively for parsing
whole sentences (Taira et al., 2007). In compari-
son, the state-of-the-art parsers have performance
accuracies in the low nineties for link precision and
recall in the domain of newspaper text, with per-
formance unknown in the domain of clinical text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.831312">
Link Reduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977769230769">
Our system classifies dependency links into
two types — bilexical links and trilexical links. A
bilexical link is a strong dependency relation be-
tween two words (e.g. determiner noun) whereas
a trilexical link usually has a mediator word in be-
tween the two words (e.g. finding--).in--).location).
When possible, a trilexical link is converted to a
bilexical link by the elimination of the mediator
word and the link type is tagged by the mediator
word. The link type can play important roles in
certain cases. In cases where the mediator word is
also important, the trilexical link is considered as a
pair of bilexical links.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.364707">
oken Level Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916285714286">
Once the parse tree is obtained, the tokens are
normalized to their base form. The normalization is
an approximate kind of lemmatization. However
we also perform word level synonym normaliza-
tion. For lemmatization, we use the Lexical Va-
riant Generator tools developed by the National
Library of Medicine for biomedical text (McCray
et al., 1994). For synonyms, we use a handcrafted
lexicon built for the domain of radiology. This step
helps in avoiding missing a mapping due to lexical
differences due to pluralization, abbreviations and
acronyms, case differences etc. This representation
is referred to as the normalized dependency vector
space representation

3.3 Mapping to a Terminology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999734">
The normalized dependency parse tree is
represented as in a vector space as a bag-of-links as
analogous to the so-called bag-of-words represen-
tation in conventional information retrieval. Two
phrases can now be compared by using similarity
measures such as cosine, dice, Jaccard etc. within
the dimension-space of dependency-links. One
phrase can be the anatomy phrase in a clinical re-
port and the other phrase can be an entry in a stan-
dardized terminology.

An exercise in normalization is described in
Figure 2 to illustrate how this method works. Con-
sider the following phrase in a neuro-radiology
report: ventral postero-medial thalamic nucleus.
The corresponding concept in the target terminolo-
gy is the phrase postero-medial ventral nucleus of
thalamus. These phrases if compared by string
matching will not result in direct matches. Permut-
ing words and trying to compare rearrangements is
complicated. In our approach, we first preprocess
our terminology list and store it in a database. The
preprocessing step is described in the right column
(Phrase 2) of Figure 2. Starting with the phrase
postero-medial ventral nucleus of thalamus, we
first tokenize the individual words (lexical analy-
sis) in the first step. In the second step, we parse
the phrase to arrive at the dependency tree. In the
third step, the trilexical link nuc-
leus&lt;--of&lt;--thalamus is converted to a bilexical link
by eliminating the word of and tagging it as the
link type. In the following step, each word is nor-
malized to its base form. In the fifth step, the
phrase is represented as a bag-of-links and stored
in a database. Similarly all the other phrases in our
terminology are stored.
When the query phrase ventral postero-medial
thalamic nucleus is compared against the terminol-
ogy it undergoes the same processes previously
described (Figure 2, Phrase 1). The importance of
word-normalization can be seen here. In step 4, the
word thalamic is normalized to thalamus. The final
output is the bag-of-links representation. For con-

venience of comparison Figure 2 shows together,
the query phrase and target phrase undergoing the
various steps starting from a bag-of-words repre-
sentation to a bag-of-links representation. It is clear
that both phrases look identical in the final repre-
sentation. While a string comparison would have
missed equating the two in their original word-
level representation, a comparison in the depen-
dency vector space is likely to score them as a per-
fect match.

4 Experiment and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838216216216">
We obtained a set of 2500 neuro-radiology re-
ports from our university medical center. Using the
shallow semantic parser, we extracted a set of 2551
unique anatomical phrases. Of the 2551 phrases,
819 phrases were single worded terms. We dis-
carded the single word terms. Single worded
phrases do not fall into the difficult-to-map catego-
ry which this method is specifically aiming to ad-
dress. Moreover, a minimum of two words are
required to define a syntactic dependency and thus
the method is irrelevant for single worded terms.
Thus we used only the 1732 multi-worded terms in
our experiment. The average length of the multi-
worded terms was 2.48 words.
We chose the UMLS, a coordinated repository
of vocabularies as a target for concept coding. To
reduce complexity, we removed non-English con-
cepts and concepts outside the domain of neuro-
radiology by filtering out unrelated concepts. Our
final terminology had a size of about 100,000 en-
tries. We preprocessed the entire terminology us-
ing the above mentioned steps and stored the
dependency representation in a database. Every
anatomy phrase was queried against this database
and cosine similarity was used to measure relev-
ance. No weighting system was employed although
it is possible to weight links by their types. A phy-
sician domain expert manually evaluated the re-
sults of the 1732 queries for performance. Of the
1732 phrases, 1091 phrases (62.9% accuracy, 95%
CI ±0.946%) were successfully matched. Since the
target set is extremely large in size (as in any IR
system), a recall analysis was not performed. A
baseline comparison with MMTx (in phrase mode)
resulted in 1051 phrases (60.68% accuracy, 95%
CI ±0.49%) being mapped by MMTx. Table 1
summarizes the results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991823529412">
A syntactic parser can parse a sentence and
identify dependency relations in a sentence. How-
ever, when a phrase is given as an input, it is not
always easy to parse a phrase and generate a de-
pendency representation. There is context (remain-
ing portions of the sentence) missing which is
needed to unambiguously parse the phrase. In the
case of anatomical phrases, our system was able to
parse it because the source sentences from which
they were extracted were available. However, in
the case of the UMLS phrases, there is no such
available information. Therefore manual parsing of
several UMLS phrases had to be performed. One
potential solution to this problem could be to iden-
tify MEDLINE sentences that contain these UMLS
concepts and obtain a dependency parse tree using
the context of the sentence.

Word Normalization Errors:
using them can result in advanced language under-
standing, they may not be suitable for real-time
applications. There is always a tradeoff between
accuracy and speed and it remains to be seen if
robust low complexity parsers can be developed.
There is a natural ambiguity introduced when
words are normalized to their base forms. Words
with completely different senses can have the same
root form (e.g. left leaves and left left (spatial
direction)). Similarly, a word can have different
normalized forms depending on the sense (e.g.
leaf leaves and left leaves). A robust method
for word-level normalization is desired that can
also perform word-sense disambiguation. Current-
ly the NLM&apos;s word level normalization tool is be-
ing used which is not perfect and therefore errors
introduced due to this module result in the entire
phrase being transformed incorrectly or ambi-
guously. The ideal word level normalization will
result in the words cancer, cancerous, carcinoma
all conflating to the same word which is beyond
purely morphological analysis.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.788951">
Link Reduction Errors:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999027023809524">
Not all relations manifest as simple bilexical
and trilexical links. Some relations are tetralexical
and although they can be reduced effectively to
bilexical links, the methodology needs to be inves-
tigated. To illustrate, consider the phrases `mass
consistent with cancer&apos; and `cancerous mass&apos;
parsed as
mass consistent with cancer
cancerous mass.
The former is parsed as four words with three
links. To convert it into a bilexical link, the words
`consistent&apos; and `with&apos; need to be: (&apos;) clustered as
a single token and (2) eliminated by transferring it
to the link as a label. This is a more complicated
process and we still haven&apos;t explored such abstrac-
tions. A robust rule based link reduction system is
desired to handle such cases.
Another limitation of this method is that the
heuristic rules for link reduction may not be appli-
cable outside the radiology domain. Finally, syn-
tactic dependency parsers are built using
computationally complex algorithms. Thus while
The inability to perform a recall analysis also
make is difficult to Judge the theoretical best per-
formance. That is, it is quite likely that there are
many phrases in our dataset that do not have a cor-
responding UMLS concept. Performing a recall
analysis would help in determining this.
While we noticed several areas of improvement
in our system, we were encouraged by the compar-
ison of the overall results of our system to that of
MMTx. We did not do an error analysis of MMTx
since several previous publications have docu-
mented the various kinds of errors in MMTx (Ba-
shyam et al., 2007; Divita et al., 2004; Meng et al.,
2005). Our idea is to provide a baseline compari-
son showing that our approach performs compara-
bly if not better than MMTx which is the most
commonly used&apos; tool for concept coding. To our
knowledge this the first time syntactic dependen-
cies have been used for this task, Previous attempts
have relied purely on shallow parsers.

Syntactic dependency based methods for med-

expected that the principle is general enough to be

<abstract confidence="0.999400772727273">Medical concepts in clinical reports can be found with a high degree of variability of expression. Normalizing medical concepts to standardized vocabularies is a common way of accounting for this variability. One of the challenges in medical concept normalization is the difficulty in comparing two concepts which are orthographically different in representation but are identical in meaning. In this work we describe a method to compare medical phrases by utilizing the information found in syntactic dependencies. We collected a large corpus of radiology reports from our university medical center. A shallow semantic parser was used to identify anatomical phrases. We performed a series of transformations to convert the anatomical phrase into a normalized syntactic dependency representation. The new representation provides an easy intuitive way of comparing the phrases for the purpose of concept normalization.</abstract>

Thus while The inability to perform a recall analysis also make is difficult to Judge the theoretical best performance. That is, it is quite likely that there are many phrases in our dataset that do not have a corresponding UMLS concept. Performing a recall analysis would help in determining this. While we noticed several areas of improvement in our system, we were encouraged by the comparison of the overall results of our system to that of MMTx. We did not do an error analysis of MMTx since several previous publications have documented the various kinds of errors in MMTx (Bashyam et al., 2007; Divita et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2005). Our idea is to provide a baseline comparison showing that our approach performs comparably if not better than MMTx which is the most commonly used&apos; tool for concept coding. To our knowledge this the first time syntactic dependencies have been used for this task, Previous attempts have relied purely on shallow parsers. 6 Future Work Increasing the robustness of the individual modules is a primary requirement for further experiments to prevent the weakest link effect cascading to the final output.

That is, it is quite likely that there are many phrases in our dataset that do not have a corresponding UMLS concept. Performing a recall analysis would help in determining this. While we noticed several areas of improvement in our system, we were encouraged by the comparison of the overall results of our system to that of MMTx. We did not do an error analysis of MMTx since several previous publications have documented the various kinds of errors in MMTx (Bashyam et al., 2007; Divita et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2005). Our idea is to provide a baseline comparison showing that our approach performs comparably if not better than MMTx which is the most commonly used&apos; tool for concept coding. To our knowledge this the first time syntactic dependencies have been used for this task, Previous attempts have relied purely on shallow parsers. 6 Future Work Increasing the robustness of the individual modules is a primary requirement for further experiments to prevent the weakest link effect cascading to the final output.

The normalization is an approximate kind of lemmatization. However we also perform word level synonym normalization. For lemmatization, we use the Lexical Variant Generator tools developed by the National Library of Medicine for biomedical text (McCray et al., 1994). For synonyms, we use a handcrafted lexicon built for the domain of radiology. This step helps in avoiding missing a mapping due to lexical differences due to pluralization, abbreviations and acronyms, case differences etc. This representation is referred to as the normalized dependency vector space representation 3.3 Mapping to a Terminology The normalized dependency parse tree is represented as in a vector space as a bag-of-links as analogous to the so-called bag-of-words representation in conventional information retrieval.

That is, it is quite likely that there are many phrases in our dataset that do not have a corresponding UMLS concept. Performing a recall analysis would help in determining this. While we noticed several areas of improvement in our system, we were encouraged by the comparison of the overall results of our system to that of MMTx. We did not do an error analysis of MMTx since several previous publications have documented the various kinds of errors in MMTx (Bashyam et al., 2007; Divita et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2005). Our idea is to provide a baseline comparison showing that our approach performs comparably if not better than MMTx which is the most commonly used&apos; tool for concept coding.

The following steps are taken in the representation conversion: Syntactic Parsing The anatomy phrase identified by the phrase parser preserves lexical information which is used to obtain a dependency parse tree using a full syntactic parser. This parser is based on a novel field theory approach to dependency parsing. The parser is strongly modeled for the radiology domain with performance accuracies of 84.9% and 89.9% for link precision and recall respectively for parsing whole sentences (Taira et al., 2007). In comparison, the state-of-the-art parsers have performance accuracies in the low nineties for link precision and recall in the domain of newspaper text, with performance unknown in the domain of clinical text. Link Reduction Our system classifies dependency links into two types — bilexical links and trilexical links. A bilexical link is a strong dependency relation between two words (e.g. determiner noun) whereas a trilexical link usually has a mediator word in between the two words (e.g. finding--).in--).location).

These approaches are based on mostly on lexical matching (Bashyam et al., 2007), string matching (Nadkarni et al., 2001), statistical indexing (Cooper and 125 Proceedings of the Workshop on BioNLP, pages 125–132, Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. c�2009 Association for Computational Linguistics Figure 1.
