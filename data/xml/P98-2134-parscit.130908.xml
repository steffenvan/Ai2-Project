Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998992777777778">
Rich mark-up can considerably benefit the process
of establishing bitext correspondences, that is, the
task of providing correct identification and align-
ment methods for text segments that are transla-
tion equivalences of each other in a parallel corpus.
We present a sentence alignment algorithm that, by
taking advantage of previously annotated texts, ob-
tains accuracy rates close to 100%. The algorithm
evaluates the similarity of the linguistic and extra-
linguistic mark-up in both sides of a bitext. Given
that annotations are neutral with respect to typolog-
ical, grammatical and orthographical differences be-
tween languages, rich mark-up becomes an optimal
foundation to support bitext correspondences. The
main originality of this approach is that it makes
maximal use of annotations, which is a very sensible
and efficient method for the exploitation of parallel
corpora when annotations exist.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958574468085">
Adequate encoding schemes applied to large
bodies of text in electronic form have been a
main achievement in the field of humanities
computing. Research in computational linguis-
tics, which since the late 1980s has resorted to
methodologies involving statistics and probabil-
ities in large corpora, has however largely ne-
glected the existence and provision of extra in-
formation from such encoding schemes. In this
paper we present an approach to sentence align-
ment that crucially relies on previously intro-
duced annotations in a parallel corpus. Fol-
lowing (Harris 88), corpora containing bilingual
texts have been called &amp;quot;bitexts&amp;quot; (Melamed 97),
(Martinez et al. 97).
The utility of annotated bitexts will be
demonstrated by the proposition of a methodol-
ogy that crucially takes advantage of rich mark-
up to resolve bitext correspondences, that is,
the task of providing correct identification and
alignment methods for text segments that are
translation equivalencies of each other (Chang
&amp; Chen 97). Bitext correspondences provide a
great source of information for applications such
as example and memory based approaches to
machine translation (Sumita &amp; Iida 91), (Brown
et al. 93), (Collins et al. 96); bilingual termi-
nology extraction (Kupiec 93), (Eijk 93), (Da-
gan et al. 94), (Smajda et al. 96); bilingual
lexicography (Catizione et al. 93), (Daille et
al. 94), (Gale &amp; Church, 91b); multilingual in-
formation retrieval (SIGIR 96), and word-sense
disambiguation (Gale et al. 92), (Chan &amp; Chen
97). Moreover, the increasing availability of
running parallel text in annotated form (e.g.
WWW pages), together with evidence that poor
mark-up (as HTML) will progressively be re-
placed by richer mark-up (e.g. SGML/XML),
are good enough reasons to investigate methods
that benefit from such encoding schemes.
We first provide details of how a bitext sam-
ple has been marked-up, with particular em-
phasis on the recognition and annotation of
proper nouns. Then we show how sentence
alignment relies on mark-up by the application
of a methodology that resorts to annotations to
determine the similarity between sentence pairs.

This is the &apos;tags as cognates&apos; algorithm, TasC.
2 Bitext tagging and segmentation
A large bitext has been compiled consisting of a
collection of administrative and legal bilingual
documents written both in Spanish and Basque,
with close to 7 million words in each language.
For the experiments, we have worked on a rep-
resentative subset of around 500,000 words in
each language. Several stages of automatic tag-
ging, based on pattern matching and heuristics,
were undertaken, rendering different descriptive
levels:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988788384615385">
• General encoding (paragraph, sentence,
quoted text, dates, numbers, abbrevia-
tions, etc.).
• Document specific tags that identify doc-
ument types and define document internal
organisation (sections, divisions, identifica-
tion code, number and date of issue, issuer,
lists, itemised sections, etc.).
• Proper noun tagging (identification and
categorisation of proper nouns into several
classes, including: person, place, organi-
sation, law, title, publication and uncate-
gorised).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889153846154">
This collection of tags (shown in Table 1) re-
flects basic structural and referential features,
which appear consistently at both sides of the
bitext. Although the alignment of smaller seg-
ments (multi-word lexical units and colloca-
tions) will require more expressive tagging, such
as part-of-speech tagging (POS), for the task
of sentence alignment, this is not only unnec-
essary, but also inappropriate, since it would
introduce undesired language dependent infor-
mation. The encoding scheme has been based
on TEI&apos;s guidelines for SGML based mark-up
(Ide &amp; Veronis 95).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990413">
2.1 Proper noun tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945852941177">
As for many other text processing applications,
proper noun tagging plays a key role in our
approach to sentence alignment. It has been
reported that proper nouns reach up to 10%
of tokens in text (newswire text (Wakao et al.
96) and (Coates-Stephens 92)) and one third of
noun groups (in the Agence France Presse flow
(Wolinski et al. 95)). We have calculated that
proper nouns constitute a 15% of the tokens in
our corpus. The module for the recognition of
proper nouns relies on patterns of typography
(capitalisation and punctuation) and on contex-
tual information (Church 88). It also makes use
of lists with most common person, organisation,
law, publication and place names. The tagger
annotates a multi-word chain as a proper noun
when each word in the chain is uppercase initial.
A closed list of functional words (prepositions,
conjunctions, determiners, etc.) is allowed to
appear inside the proper noun chain, see exam-
ples in Table 2. A collection of heuristics dis-
card uppercase initial words in sentence initial
position or in other exceptional cases.
In contrast with other known classifications
(e.g. MUC-6 95), we exclude from our list
of proper nouns time expressions, percentage
expression, and monetary amount expressions
(which for us fall under a different descriptive
level). However, on top of organisation, person
and location names, we include other entities
such as legal nomenclature, the name of publi-
cations as well as a number of professional titles
whose occurrence in the bitext becomes of great
value for alignment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999838">
2.2 Bitext asymmetries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998812">
Because our approach to alignment relies on
consistent tagging, bitext asymmetries of any
type need to be carefully dealt with. For exam-
ple, capitalisation conventions across languages
may show great divergences. Although, in the-
ory, this should not be the case between Spanish
and Basque, since officially they follow identical
conventions for capitalisation (which are by the
way the same as in French), in practise these
conventions have been interpreted very differ-
ently by the writers of the two versions (lawyers
in Spanish and translators in Basque). In the
Basque version, nouns referring to organisations
saila &apos;Department&apos;, professional titles diputatua
&apos;Deputy&apos;, as well as many orographic or geo-
graphical sites arana &apos;Valley&apos;, are often written
in lowercase, while in the Spanish original doc-
uments these are normally written in uppercase
(see Table 2). These nouns belong to the type
described as &apos;trigger&apos; words by (Wakao et al.
96), in the sense that they permit the identifi-
cation of the tokens surrounding them as proper
nouns. Then, it has been required to resort to
contextual information. The results of the reso-
lution of these singularities are shown in Table

3 Using tags as cognates for
sentence alignment
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752117647059">
Algorithms for sentence alignment abound and
range from the initial pioneering proposals of
(Brown et al. 91), (Gale &amp; Church 91a),
(Church 93), or (Kay &amp; Roscheisen 93), to the
more recent ones of (Chang &amp; Chen 97), or
(Tillmann et al. 97). The techniques employed
include statistical machine translation, cognates
identification, pattern recognition, and digital
signal and image processing. Our algorithm,
as (Simard et al. 92), and (Melamed 97) em-
ploys cognates to align sentences; and similar to
(Brown et al. 91), it also uses mark-up for that
purpose. Its singularity does not lie on the use
of mark-up as delimiter of text regions (Brown
et al. 91) in combination with other techniques,
but on the fact that it is the sole foundation
for sentence alignment. We call it the &apos;tags
as cognates&apos; algorithm, TasC. This algorithm is
not disrupted by word order differences or small
asymmetries in non-literal translation, and, un-
like other reported algorithms (Melamed 97),
it possesses the additional advantage of being
portable to any pair of languages without the
need to resort to any language-specific heuris-
tics. Provided an adequate and consistent bi-
text mark-up, sentence alignment becomes a
simple and accurate process also in the case of
typologically disparate or orthographically dis-
tinct language pairs for which techniques based
on lexical cognates may be problematic. One of
the best consequences of this approach is that
the burden of language dependent processing is
dispatched to the monolingual tagging and seg-
mentation phase.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999815">
3.1 Similarity calculus between bitexts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908153846154">
The alignment algorithm establishes similarity
metrics between candidate sentences which are
delimited by corresponding mark-up. Dice&apos;s co-
efficient is used to calculate these similarity met-
rics (Dice 45). The coefficient returns a real nu-
meric value in the range 0 to 1. Two sentences
which are totally dissimilar in the content of
their internal mark-up will return a Dice score
of 0, while two identical contents will return a
Dice score of 1.
For two text segments, P and Q, one in each
language, the formula for Dice&apos;s similarity coef-
ficient will be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988771">
Dice(P,Q) = 2FpQ Fp + FQ
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999337416666667">
where FpQ is the number of identical tags that
P and Q have in common, and Fp and FQ are
the number of tags contained by each text seg-
ment P and Q.
Since the alignment algorithm determines
the best matching on the basis of tag
similarity, not only tag names used to
categorise different cognate classes (num-
ber, date, abbreviation, proper noun, etc.),
but also attributes contained by these tags
may help identify the cognate itself: &lt;num
num=57 &gt; 57 &lt; /num&gt; . Furthermore, attributes

may serve also to subcategorise proper noun
tags: &lt;rs type=place&gt;Bilbao&lt;/rs&gt;.
Such subcategorisations are of great value to
calculate the similarity metrics. If mark-up is
consistent, the correlation between tags in the
candidate text segments will be high and Dice&apos;s
coefficient will come close to 1. For a randomly
created bitext sample of source sentences, Fig-
ure 1 illustrates how correct candidate align-
ments have achieved the highest Dice&apos;s coeffi-
cients (represented by &apos;*&apos;s), while next higher
coefficients (represented by &apos;o&apos;s ) have achieved
significant lower values. It must be noted that
the latter do not correspond to correct values.
The difference mean between Dice&apos;s coeffi-
cients corresponding to correct alignments and
next higher values is:

E(DCci — DCwi)
= 0.45
Ti
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997210923076923">
Where for a given source sentence i, DC cz
represents Dice&apos;s coefficient corresponding to its
correct alignment and DCwi represents the next
higher value of Dice&apos;s coefficients for the same
source sentence i. In all the cases, this difference
is greater than 0.2.
For consistently marked-up bitexts, these re-
sults show that sentence alignment founded on
the similarity between annotations can be ro-
bust criterion.

erality to the assignment problem and makes it
possible to add constraints to the solutions re-
ported in the literature. These constraints take
into account the order in which sentences in
both the source and target texts have been writ-
ten, and capture the prevailing fact that trans-
lators maintain the order of the original text
in their translations, which is even a stronger
property of specialised texts.
By default, a whole document delimits the
space in which sentence alignment will take
place, although this space can be customised
in the algorithm. The average number of sen-
tences per document is approximately 18. Two
types of alignment can take place:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995589666666667">
• 1 to 1 alignment: when one sentence in the
source document corresponds to one sen-
tence in the target document (94.39% of
the cases).
• N to M alignment: when N sentences in
the source document correspond to M sen-
tences in the target document (only 5.61%
of the cases). It includes cases of 1-2, 1-3
and 0-1 alignments.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9409565">
Both alignment types are handled by the algo-
rithm.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998431">
3.3 The algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993955043478261">
The TasC algorithm works in two steps:
1. It obtains the similarity matrix S from
Dice&apos;s coefficients corresponding to can-
didate alignment options. Each row in
S represents the alignment options of a
source sentence classified in decreasing or-
der of similarity. In this manner, each col-
umn represents a preference position (1 the
best alignment option, 2 the second best
and so on). Therefore, each Si is the
identification of one or more target sen-
tences which match the source sentence i
in the preference position j. In order to
obtain the similarity matrix, it is not nec-
essary to consider all possible alignment
options. Constraints regarding sentence
ordering and grouping greatly reduce the
number of cases to be evaluated by the al-
gorithm. In the algorithm each source sen-
tence x, is compared with candidate target
sentences yi as follows: (xi, yi); (xi, yiy3+1
, where yo3+1 represents the concate-
nation of yi with y3+1. The algorithm
module that deals with candidate align-
ment options can be easily customised to
cope with different bitext configurations
(since bitexts may range from a very simple
one-paragraph text to more complex struc-
tures). In the current version of the al-
gorithm seven alignment options are taken
into account.
2. The TasC algorithm solves an assignment
problem with several constraints. It aligns
sentences by assigning to each ith source
sentence the Si target option with min-
imum j value, that is, the option with
more similarity. Furthermore, the algo-
rithm solves the possible conflicts when a
sentence matches with other sentences al-
ready aligned. The average cost of the al-
gorithm, experimentally contrasted , is lin-
ear in the size of the input, although in the
worst case the cost is bigger.
The result of sentence alignment is reflected
in the bitext by the incorporation of the at-
tribute &apos;corresp to sentence tags, as can be seen

<bodyText confidence="0.999943357142857">
The current version of the algorithm has been
tested against a subcorpus of 500,000 words in
each language consisting of 5,988 sentences and
has rendered the results shown in Table 4.
The accuracy of the 1 to 1 alignment is 100%.
In the N to M case only 1 error occurred out of
314 sentences, which reaches 99.68% accuracy.
The algorithm to sentence alignment has been
designed in such a modular way that it can eas-
ily change the tagset used for alignment and the
weight of each tag to adapt it to different bitext
annotations. The current version of the algo-
rithm uses the tagset shown in Table 1 without
weights.

Proper nouns are a key factor for the efficient
management of the corpus, since they are the
basis for the indexation and retrieval of doc-
uments in the two versions. For this reason,
at present we are concerned with proper noun
alignment, something which is not usually done
in the mapping of bitexts. The alignment is
achieved by resorting to:

<listItem confidence="0.99935975">
• The identification of cognate nouns, aided
by a set of phonological rules that apply

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984416666667">
The next step is the recognition and alignment
of other multi-word lexical units and colloca-
tions. Due to the still unstable translation
choices of much administrative terminology in
Basque, on top of the considerable typological
and structural differences between Basque and
Spanish, many of the techniques reported in the
literature (Smadja et al. 96), (Kupiec 93) and
(Eijk 93) cannot be effectively applied. POS
tagging combined with recurrent bilingual glos-
sary lookup is the approach we are currently
experimenting with.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996266666667">
We have presented a sentence alignment ap-
proach that, by taking advantage of previously
introduced mark-up, obtains accuracy rates
close to 100%. This approach is not disrupted
by word order differences and is portable to any
pair of languages without the need to resort to
any language specific heuristics. Provided and
adequate and consistent bitext mark-up, sen-
tence alignment becomes an accurate and ro-
bust process also in the case of typologically
distinct language pairs for which other known
techniques may be problematic. The TasC algo-
rithm has been designed in such a modular way
that it can be easily adapted to different bitext
configurations as well as other specific tagsets.

<abstract confidence="0.999422">Rich mark-up can considerably benefit the process of establishing bitext correspondences, that is, the task of providing correct identification and alignment methods for text segments that are translation equivalences of each other in a parallel corpus. We present a sentence alignment algorithm that, by taking advantage of previously annotated texts, obtains accuracy rates close to 100%. The algorithm evaluates the similarity of the linguistic and extralinguistic mark-up in both sides of a bitext. Given that annotations are neutral with respect to typological, grammatical and orthographical differences between languages, rich mark-up becomes an optimal foundation to support bitext correspondences. The main originality of this approach is that it makes maximal use of annotations, which is a very sensible and efficient method for the exploitation of parallel corpora when annotations exist.</abstract>
