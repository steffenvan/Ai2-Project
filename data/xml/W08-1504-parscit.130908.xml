Voice over IP and the open source technologies are
becoming popular choices for organizations.
However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways
these systems fail to attract the global users
economically. The objective of this paper is to
demonstrate how an existing web application can be
modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual
access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way
for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a
VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service
provider (VSP) does not provide a local
geographical number to global customers to access
the application. In addition, we introduce an
economical way for small sized businesses to
overcome the high cost of setting up and using a
commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is
based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the
entire process, we present a sample Package
Tracking System application, which is based on an
existing website and provides the same functionality
as the website does. We also present an online
demonstration, which provides global access to
commercial voice platforms (i.e. Voxeo, Tellme
Studio, Bevocal and DemandVoice). This paper also
discusses various scenarios in which spoken
interaction can play a significant role.

<bodyText confidence="0.999955714285714">
The end of the 20th century witnesses an explosive growth in
Internet usage. We have seen an explosion in the number of
browser-based visual applications, from the broad examples
we use every day, such as e-commerce, movie or flight
schedules, and financial information. The most common
means for accessing information residing on many websites
across the globe is still the dominating interface of point and
click with a mouse using the graphical user interface (GUI).
Additionally, telephone is also widely used to access
information. Still, in densely populated countries it seems to
be difficult to handle large amounts of calls simultaneously,
which leads to long call queues and frustrated customers.
However, the challenge that is presented to the present
Internet world is to make the enormous web content

accessible to users who don’t have the computers or maybe
don’t have the money to buy as well as visually impaired
users. Since speech is the most natural means of
communication, especially for these users, voice will be a
dominating mode in newly designed multi-modal (Oviatt,
S.L., 1999) user interfaces for future devices. This calls for a
revolutionary design of a voice user interface (VUI) to
supplement the conventional GUIs. Internet and telephony
used to be two separate technologies to build applications
accessible over the phone. VoiceXML bridges the gap; it
leverages the existing web infrastructure and enables web
developers to build voice-enabled web applications
accessible from any telephone, by anyone, anywhere,
anytime. A major advantage of VoiceXML is that it provides
web content over a simple telephone device, making it
possible to access an application even without a computer
and an Internet connection. VoiceXML finds ready
acceptance in the business world due to the following
reasons.
Providing a voice-based interface with the web interface is
an advantage to the visually challenged who are unable to use
a visual interface. It is also possible to use the application for
accessing a web-based interface even while on the move
through a mobile phone, which is much easier to carry
around than a personal computer. Phone applications are
more spontaneous. Most people these days always have their
phone on their hip. In many cases, the phone transaction can
be completed before the PC even boots or you can log in.
Lastly, there is no possibility of a virus from a phone call and
it is typically much more secure.
The number of telephone users is far greater than the
number of people who use personal computers or the
Internet.
Thus, by using VoiceXML applications, we can reach out
to more customers than is possible by using the Internet.
Voice portals put all kinds of information at a consumer&apos;s
fingertips anytime, anywhere. Customers just dial into the
voice portal&apos;s 800 number and use simple voice commands to
access whatever information they need. It&apos;s quick, easy, and
effective, even from a car or the airport. However, it still fails
to attract the huge global customers as they have to pay the
long distance calling charge to access the information. Hence,
this paper is an attempt to peep behind the curtain and
analyze the market trends and thereby proposes a solution to
resolve the current issues and satisfy the global customers by
providing them a solution to access the VoiceXML gateway
economically. The structure of this paper is as follows. In the

2 Voice Hosting Infrastructure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886">
A voice hosting infrastructure requires many interlocking
components such as telephony hardware, software: TTS (text
to speech, ASR (automatic speech recognition), networking
technology, monitoring and administrative services. We
discuss all the essential elements bellow.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997578">
2.1 Linking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711333333333">
Most of the VoiceXML gateways (Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M.
2003) can operate VoiceXML speech applications on any
standard web server and can support both static and dynamic
content, and provide a high degree of scalability and
platform-independence. Also, voice applications can be
seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise web and IT
infrastructure. There are two ways to accomplish the task:
-Link your existing web server with VSP’s voice
gateways.
-Port your web applications to VSP’s web server.
Linking an existing web application with VoiceXML
gateways is fairly straightforward. As you see in figure 1,
when a VoiceXML gateway receives a phone call, it looks at
the number dialed to lookup the URL of the web server, then
sends the HTTP request. You need to provide the URL of
your web server to VSP. One VSP provides Web-based GUI
for linking an application as shown in Figure 1.
There may be some changes required to your Web server
before you connect with your VSP. Changes vary from VSP
to VSP, or depending on your service provider and type of
Web server. As an example, our application residing on an
Apache HTTP Server, according to Bevocal, must modify the
httpd.conf file to add the new MIME type in the following
way.

2.2 Mapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998969388888889">
Speech-enabled Internet portals, or voice portals, are quickly
becoming the hottest trend in e-commerce-broadening access
to Internet content to everyone with the most universal
communications device of all, the telephone. Currently,
voice hosting providers set up local toll free numbers or DID
(direct inward dialing) numbers in order to access voice
applications through their VoiceXML gateways. If the VSP is
unable to provide the local DID numbers in the desired
country, the users from that country have to pay international
calling charges, which is sometimes quite expensive. We
propose our idea to resolve this issue as follows.
SIP Mapping: It totally depends upon the telephony
infrastructure of the VoiceXML gateway. If it is asterisk-
based (Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J. 2007) then the
job is fairly easy, otherwise it could be a tedious task to
configure a VoiceXML gateway with a remote telephony
network. Our proposed idea is independent of any kind of
telephony infrastructure, provided it supports SIP signaling.

The most promising way to connect a VoiceXML gateway
with a third party&apos;s Asterisk server (any IP-PBX) is to use the
ENUM service. In order to use ENUM DNS efficiently, there
are few steps needed to be followed. First of all, at e164.org
(Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 2003), in the ENUM database, we
need to register the IP address and DID number, which is
landing on your SIP extension of VoiceXML Gateway, as
depicted in the figure 2.

Moreover, they do not want to accept anonymous SIP calls,
and want to run their own IP-PBX instead of using client’s
IP-PBX. In that case, we propose a very easy solution to set

<bodyText confidence="0.998914290322581">
After editing the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping)
entry, we set up the ENUM trunk and outbound route on the
remote IP-PBX machine.
We are running Elastix IP-PBX (elastix.org) on the remote
side because it is easy to manage the configuration through
GUI on Elastix. Moreover, it is an open source technology,
and comes with a self-installing package that installs a
complete operating system, Asterisk PBX, FreePBX etc.
9|.XXXXXXXXXXXXX (X matches any digit from 0 to 9)
According to our dial plan shown above, let’s assume that
we need to dial the American DID number 641-543-6745,
and dialing pattern would be like: 916415436745.
Our DID number 641-543-6745 is registered at e164.org.
This means that when someone calls the DID, the call will
land on the SIP number instead of DID number, as the
e164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing and
protocol information needed to connect to your VoiceXML
gateway . In other words, the call will not go over the DID
provider’s network (see figure 3).
There would be a native or Packet2Packet SIP bridging
between the VoiceXML gateway and remote IP-PBX.
Ultimately, VSP and remote client will not pay any toll to
PSTN operator or ITSP (Internet Telephony Service
Provider) because the call bypasses their network. Moreover,
the VSP does not need to open all the credentials of
telephony setup of the VoiceXML gateway. So, most of the
information will be isolated from the remote client. This is
attractive to the VSP that does not want to register the sip
number and IP address of the gateway in the ENUM
(tElephone NUmber Mapping) database, (because some
people are afraid to disclose their IP addresses to others).

Both of the above mentioned methods are really good if VSP
does not want to use a remote IP-PBX for outbound calls.
On the contrary, when VSP wants to setup outbound calls on
the remote machine, we propose another idea to accomplish
the task. Fortunately, this is very easy to configure the

machines on both sides, if a telephony infrastructure uses an
asterisk-based PBX on both ends.
In this scenario, we can register the machines with each other
using username and secret or we can use IP-based
authentication without registering with each other. Actually,
it is very easy on Elastix because it uses a Freepbx for
configuring most of the tasks of Asterisk server.
In other words, it’s becoming less and less common to have
static IP addresses. So, if you have a dynamic IP address it is
good to go with username and secret. Typically, we have to
deal with sip.conf and extensions.conf on Asterisk, provided
you use sip protocol. For a sample configuration code
(Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J. 2007) see subsection
DID Mapping.

When a VoiceXML gateway does not support SIP signaling.
b) When VSP wants to land the calls only on a DID number

<bodyText confidence="0.91385925">
First, if it is a toll free DID number then the remote client
can dial through ENUM in order to connect with a toll free
gateway, and call will land on the toll free network, which is
connected with a VoiceXML gateway (see figure 5). It means
a toll free subscriber has to pay for it, and the call between a
remote IP-PBX and the toll free gateway would be free,
because it will go over the internet.

For example, we connect DemandVoice’s voice gateway
using a toll free DID number remotely as follows:

Or you can dial through ENUM as we discussed in
subsection SIP Mapping.
If it is a DID number and has no registration in the ENUM
database then you need to originate the call using your ITSP,
and the call will directly land on your DID assigned for your
application by VSP. With the advent of VOIP technology,

there has been a flood of ITSP (Internet Telephony Service

We have tested the following configuration using our Static

numbers.
If there are issues for porting the existing number, we
propose a very simple idea to install an asterisk-based IP-
PBX at your premises and route the calls landing on your
existing number to VoiceXML gateway using a sip or ITSP

Adding VoiceXML interface (Tsai, M.-J. 2005) (Kenneth, R.
A. 2001) (Yankelovich, N., 2000) to web contents presents
unique challenges to designers. Complexity depends upon the
web application’s architecture. In this section, we
demonstrate how to modify an existing package tracking web
site powered by a relational database. We use PHP, MySQL,
Apache web server, and these tools are widely used in web
applications development, because these are cross-platform
and open source technologies. There are a couple of ways to
add voice user interfacing (VUI). It is possible to add
VoiceXML tags either on the fly when the VoiceXML
interpreter extracts the contents from the web server or in
other case tags can be embedded into an existing web page.
However, we concentrate only on the latter case. First of all
let’s have a look on a web application (see figure 7)
(Tracking number: 6754356786). This application is
available on the following URL for demonstrating the task.

3. Scenarios for Using Voice User Interfacing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986337846153846">
Despite the availability of various media of communication
utilized in human computer interaction, people tend to prefer
the more social medium of communication such as voice.
With the advent of the Internet, the PC has become the most
preferred device which people turn to when they need to
enquire for information. On the interaction side, the
telephone seems to remain the best example for usability
preferred by the various classes of users. So, to power of
voice communication, with the richness of the Internet on
one side, and the usability of the phone device on the other
side, we present various situations in which VUI can be of
great utility.
Situations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99997425">
• Driving
• No internet service
• Visually Impaired persons
• Replacement of human operators
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844785714286">
VUI is the most time efficient modality for input, because
voice input is nimbler than typing. VUI can be used to check
and answer web emails while driving a vehicle. Another class
of situations is when there is no Internet or PC available and
the user needs to access web applications such internet
banking, parcel tracking, directory assistance, online
reservation, order status enquiry, instant messaging,
electronic voting, dating/chat services, and information
services. Moreover, visually impaired people can take
advantage of the above mentioned services just over the
regular phone. Furthermore, in many situations cost
efficiency can be increased by replacing human operators in
call centers and offices with a VoiceXML-based interactive
voice response system.

4. Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978222222222">
To verify the performance of our proposed idea, we
implemented an IP-PBX, an automated package tracker and
the business listing search using VoiceXML, PHP, and
MySQL. Then, we linked remotely with various VoiceXML
gateways, and tried to call the application using different
codecs (ulaw, g729, gsm). We found that ulaw codec is much
better for interacting with the ASR engine, and also it
provides the best voice quality since it uses no compression.
This means that it has the lowest latency and the highest
MOS (Mean Opinion Score) because there are no additional
processing delays. However, it requires high bandwidth, and
this can be easily managed via proper network provisioning.
The compression has very adverse affect on speech
recognition when it comes to deal with the ASR engine. The
more compression is used, the more characters will be lost.
Fortunately, ulaw is immune to this effect. Table 2 shows the
call volume according to bandwidth and codec. Table 3
shows the hardware and software specifications.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995955">
In this paper we have targeted the large number of
international users who are deprived of taking the advantage
of using the toll free number remotely, and have introduced
an economical way to access VoiceXML gateways globally.
Moreover, our globally distributed PSTN numbers are
available to access VoiceXML platform for only research,
test and educational purpose. We conclude that the call
quality may differ depending upon the different feature sets
(e.g., codecs) and network bandwidth available. In order to
get a nice connectivity with a VoiceXML gateway, the call
should pass through minimum VOIP gateways. Currently, we
are developing a virtual user agent based on ATOM/RSS
protocol, which can be accessed by phone globally for
accessing information.

Welcome to an automated parcel tracking system. Please tell me the
10 digits tracking number of your
package.
&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;filled&gt;
&lt;prompt&gt;
The tracking number you entered is
&lt;say-as type=&amp;quot;number:digits&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;value
expr=&amp;quot;t_number&amp;quot;/&gt;&lt;/say-as&gt;
Please wait while I&apos;m checking this package&apos;s status.

<abstract confidence="0.999288037037037">Voice over IP and the open source technologies are becoming popular choices for organizations. However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways these systems fail to attract the global users economically. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how an existing web application can be modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service provider (VSP) does not provide a local geographical number to global customers to access the application. In addition, we introduce an economical way for small sized businesses to overcome the high cost of setting up and using a commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the entire process, we present a sample Package Tracking System application, which is based on an existing website and provides the same functionality as the website does. We also present an online demonstration, which provides global access to commercial voice platforms (i.e. Voxeo, Tellme Studio, Bevocal and DemandVoice). This paper also discusses various scenarios in which spoken interaction can play a significant role.</abstract>
