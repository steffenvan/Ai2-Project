This paper presents the design and construc-
tion of an annotated Chinese collocation bank
as the resource to support systematic research
on Chinese collocations. With the help of
computational tools, the bi-gram and n-gram
collocations corresponding to 3,643 head-
words are manually identified. Furthermore,
annotations for bi-gram collocations include
dependency relation, chunking relation and
classification of collocation types. Currently,
the collocation bank annotated 23,581 bi-
gram collocations and 2,752 n-gram colloca-
tions extracted from a 5-million-word corpus.
Through statistical analysis on the collocation
bank, some characteristics of Chinese bi-
gram collocations are examined which is es-
sential to collocation research, especially for
Chinese.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938540000001">
Collocation is a lexical phenomenon in which two
or more words are habitually combined and com-
monly used in a language to express certain seman-
tic meaning. For example, in Chinese, people will
say 历史-包袱 (historical baggage) rather than 历
史 -行李 (historical luggage) even though 包袱
(baggage) and 行 李 (luggage) are synonymous.
However, no one can argue why 历史 must collo-
cate with 包袱. Briefly speaking, collocations are
frequently used word combinations. The collocated
words always have syntactic or semantic relations
but they cannot be generated directly by syntactic
or semantic rules. Collocation can bring out differ-
ent meanings a word can carry and it plays an in-
dispensable role in expressing the most appropriate
meaning in a given context. Consequently, colloca-
tion knowledge is widely employed in natural lan-
guage processing tasks such as word sense disam-
biguation, machine translation, information re-
trieval and natural language generation (Manning
et al. 1999).
Although the importance of collocation is well
known, it is difficult to compile a complete collo-
cation dictionary. There are some existing corpus
linguistic researches on automatic extraction of
collocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993;
Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006). These techniques are
mainly based on statistical techniques and syntactic
analysis. However, the performances of automatic
collocation extraction systems are not satisfactory
(Pecina 2005). A problem is that collocations are
word combinations that co-occur within a short
context, but not all such co-occurrences are true
collocations. Further examinations is needed to
filter out pseudo-collocations once co-occurred
word pairs are identified. A collocation bank with
true collocations annotated is naturally an indis-
pensable resource for collocation research. (Kosho
et al. 2000) presented their works of collocation
annotation on Japanese text. Also, the Turkish
treebank, (Bedin 2003) included collocation anno-
tation as one step in its annotation. These two col-
location banks provided collocation identification
and co-occurrence verification information. (Tutin
2005) used shallow analysis based on finite state
transducers and lexicon-grammar to identify and
annotate collocations in a French corpus. This col-
location bank further provided the lexical functions
of the collocations. However to this day, there is
no reported Chinese collocation bank available.

In this paper, we present the design and con-
struction of a Chinese collocation bank (acrony-
med CCB). This is the first attempt to build a
large-scale Chinese collocation bank as a Chinese
NLP resource with multiple linguistic information
for each collocation including: (1) annotating the
collocated words for each given headword; (2) dis-
tinguishing n-gram and bi-gram collocations for
the headword; (3) for bi-gram collocations, CCB
provides their syntactic dependencies, chunking
relation and classification of collocation types
which is proposed by (Xu and Lu 2006). In addi-
tion, we introduce the quality assurance mecha-
nism used for CCB. CCB currently contains for
3,643 common headwords taken from “The Dic-
tionary of Modern Chinese Collocations” (Mei
1999) with 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations and
2,752 unique n-gram collocations extracted from a
five-million-word segmented and chunked Chinese
corpus (Xu and Lu, 2005).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents some basic concepts. Section 3
describes the annotation guideline. Section 4 de-
scribes the practical issues in the annotation proc-
ess including corpus preparation, headword prepa-
ration, annotation flow, and the quality assurance
mechanism. Section 5 gives current status of CCB
and characteristics analysis of the annotated collo-
cations. Section 6 concludes this paper.

2 Basic Concepts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999677060606061">
Although collocations are habitual expressions in
natural language use and they can be easily under-
stood by people, a precise definition of collocation
is still far-reaching (Manning et al. 1999). In this
study, we define a collocation as a recurrent and
conventional expression of two or more content
words that holds syntactic and semantic relation.
Content words in Chinese include noun, verb, ad-
jective, adverb, determiner, directional word, and
gerund. Collocations with only two words are
called bi-gram collocations and others are called n-
gram collocations.
From a linguistic view point, collocations have a
number of characteristics. Firstly, collocations are
recurrent as they are of habitual use. Collocations
occur frequently in similar contexts and they ap-
pear in certain fixed patterns. However, they can-
not be described by the same set of syntactic or
semantic rules. Secondly, free word combinations
which can be generated by linguistic rules are
normally considered compositional. In contrast,
collocations should be limited compositional
(Manning et al. 1999) and they usually carry addi-
tional meanings when used as a collocation.
Thirdly, collocations are also limited substitutable
and limited modifiable. Limited substitutable here
means that a word cannot be freely substituted by
other words with similar linguistic functions in the
same context such as synonyms. Also, many collo-
cations cannot be modified freely by adding modi-
fiers or through grammatical transformations.
Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja
1993) and language-dependent.

3 Annotation Guideline Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987675">
The guideline firstly determines the annotation
strategy.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9453852">
(1) The annotation of CCB follows the head-
word-driven strategy. The annotation uses selected
headwords as the starting point. In each circle, the
collocations corresponding to one headword are
annotated. Headword-driven strategy makes a
more efficient annotation as it is helpful to estimate
and compare the relevant collocations.
(2) CCB is manually annotated with the help of
automatic estimation of computational features, i.e.
semi-automatic software tools are used to generate
parsing and chunking candidates and to estimate
the classification features. These data are present to
the annotators for determination. The use of assis-
tive tools is helpful to produce accurate annota-
tions with efficiency.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906294117647">
The guideline also specifies the information to
be annotated and the labels used in the annotation.
For a given headword, CCB annotates both bi-
gram collocations and n-gram collocations. Con-
sidering the fact that n-gram collocations consist-
ing of continuous significant bi-grams as a whole
and, the n-gram annotation is based on the identifi-
cation and verification of bi-gram word combina-
tions and is prior to the annotation of bi-gram col-
locations.
For bi-gram annotation, which is the major in-
terest in collocation research, three kinds of in-
formation are annotated. The first one is the syn-
tactic dependency of the headword and its co-word
in a bi-gram collocation . A syntactic dependency
normally consists of one word as the governor (or
head), a dependency type and another word serves

as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10
types of dependencies are annotated in CCB. They
are listed in Table 1 below.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.993489933333333">

The second one is the syntactic chunking informa-
tion (a chunk is defined as a minimum non-nesting
or non-overlapping phrase) (Xu and Lu, 2005).
Chunking information identifies all the words for a
collocation within the context of an enclosed
chunk. Thus, it is a way to identify its proper con-
text at the most immediate syntactic structure. 11
types of syntactic chunking categories given in (Xu
and 2006) are used as listed in Table 2.

The third one is the classification of collocation
types. Collocations cover a wide spectrum of ha-
bitual word combinations ranging from idioms to
free word combinations. Some collocations are
very rigid and some are more flexible. (Xu and Lu
2006) proposed a scheme to classify collocations
into four types according to the internal association
of collocations including compositionality, non-
substitutability, non-modifiability, and statistical
significance. They are,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.451261">
Type 0: Idiomatic Collocation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999446153846154">
Type 0 collocations are fully non-compositional
as its meaning cannot be predicted from the mean-
ings of its components such as�i7 *Ai (climbing
a tree to catch a fish, which is a metaphor for a
fruitless endeavour). Some terminologies are also
Type 0 collocations such as A F(Blue-tooth )
which refers to a wireless communication protocol.
Type 0 collocations must have fixed forms. Their
components are non-substitutable and non-
modifiable allowing no syntactic transformation
and no internal lexical variation. This type of col-
locations has very strong internal associations and
co-occurrence statistics is not important.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.669835">
Type 1: Fixed Collocation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868777777778">
Type 1 collocations are very limited composi-
tional with fixed forms which are non-substitutable
and non-modifiable. However, this type can be
compositional. None of the words in a Type 1 col-
location can be substituted by any other words to
retain the same meaning such as in ,#Zn , AR
/n (diplomatic immunity). Finally, Type 1 colloca-
tions normally have strong co-occurrence statistics
to support them.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.529196">
Type 2: Strong Collocation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999598">
Type 2 collocations are limitedly compositional.
They allow very limited substitutability. In other
words, their components can only be substituted by
few synonyms and the newly generated word com-
binations have similar meaning, e.g., t$$/v n�
/n (alliance formation) and t$$/v Off/n (alliance
formation). Furthermore, Type 2 collocations al-
low limited modifier insertion and the order of
components must be maintained. Type2 colloca-
tions normally have strong statistical support.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.619983">
Type 3: Loose Collocation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954071428572">
Type 3 collocations have loose restrictions.
They are nearly compositional. Their components
may be substituted by some of their synonyms and
the newly generated word combinations usually
have very similar meanings. Type 3 collocations
are modifiable meaning that they allow modifier
insertions. Type 3 collocations have weak internal
associations and they must have statistically sig-
nificant co-occurrence.
The classification represents the strength of in-
ternal associations of collocated words. The anno-
tation of these three kinds of information is essen-
tial to all-rounded characteristic analysis of collo-
cations.

4 Annotation of CCB
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998609">
4.1 Data Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716875">
CCB is based on the PolyU chunk bank (Xu and
Lu, 2005) which contains chunking information on
the People’s Daily corpus with both segmentation
and part-of-speech tags. The accuracies of word
segmentation and POS tagging are claimed to be
higher than 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu et
al. 2001). The use of this popular and accurate raw
resource helped to reduce the cost of annotation
significantly, and ensured maximal sharing of our
output.
The set of 3, 643 headwords are selected from
“The Dictionary of Modern Chinese Collocation”
(Mei 1999) among about 6,000 headwords in the
dictionary. The selection was based both on the
judgment by linguistic experts as well as the statis-
tical information that they are commonly used.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984068">
4.2 Corpus Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973891631578947">
The CCB annotations are represented in XML.
Since collocations are practical word combinations
and word is the basic unit in collocation research, a
preprocessing module is devised to transfer the
chunked sentences in the PolyU chunk bank to
word sequences with the appropriate labels to indi-
cate the corresponding chunking information. This
preprocessing module indexes the words and
chunks in the sentences and encodes the chunking
information of each word in two steps. Consider
the following sample sentence extracted from the
PolyU chunk bank:
确保/v[人民/n 群众/n]BNP 的/u[生命/n 财产/n 安全
/an ]BNP
(ensure life and property safety of the people)
The first step in preprocessing is to index each
word and the chunk in the sentence by giving in-
cremental word ids and chunk ids from left to right.
That is,,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.563892">
[W1]确保/v [W2]人民/n [W3]群众/n [W4]的/u
[W5]生命/n [W6]财产/n [W7]安全/an [C1]BNP [C2]BNP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.954164647058824">
where, [W1] to [W7] are the words and [C1] to [C2]
are chunks although chunking positions are not
included in this step. One Chinese word may occur
in a sentence for more than one times, the unique
word ids are helpful to avoid ambiguities in the
collocation annotation on these words.
The second step is to represent the chunking in-
formation of each word. Chunking boundary in-
formation is labeled by following initial/final rep-
resentation scheme. Four labels, O/B/I/E, are used
to mark the isolated words outsides any chunks,
chunk-initial words, words in the middle of chunks,
and chunk-final words, respectively. Finally, a la-
bel H is used to mark the identified head of chunks
and N to mark the non-head words.
The above sample sentence is then transferred to
a sequence of words with labels as shown below,
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.63938325">
&lt;labeled&gt; [W1][O_O_N][O]确保/v [W2][B_BNP_N][C1]

[W7][E_BNP_N][C2]安全/an &lt;/labeled&gt;
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.994746888888889">
For each word, the first label is the word ID. The
second one is a hybrid tag for describing its chunk-
ing status. The hybrid tags are ordinal with respect
to the chunking status of boundary, syntactic cate-
gory and head, For example, B_BNP_N indicates
that current word is the beginning or a BNP and
this word is not the head of this chunk. The third
one is the chunk ID if applicable. For the word out
of any chunks, a fixed chunk ID O is given.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997829">
4.3 Collocation Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987257666666667">
Collocation annotation is conducted on one head-
word at a time. For a given headword, an annota-
tors examines its context to determine if its co-
occurred word(s) forms a collocation with it and if
so, also annotate the collocation’s dependency,
chunking and classification information. The anno-
tation procedure, requires three passes. We use a
headword 安全/an (safe), as an illustrative exam-
ple.
Pass 1. Concordance and dependency identifica-
tion
In the first pass, the concordance of the given
headword is performed. Sentences containing the
headwords are obtained, e.g.
S1: 遵循/v [确保/v 安全/an]BVP 的/u 原则/n
(follow the principles for ensuring the safety)
S2: 确保/v [人民/n 群众/n]BNP 的/u[生命/n 财产/n 安
全/an]BNP
(ensure life and property safety of people)
S3: 确保/v 长江/ns [安全/an 度汛/v]BVP
(ensure the flood pass through Yangzi River safely)
With the help of an automatic dependency pars-
er, the annotator determines all syntactically and
semantically dependent words in the chunking con-
text of the observing headword. The annotation
output of S1 is given below in which XML tags are
used for the dependency annotation.

Dependency of word combination is annotated
with the tag &lt;dependency&gt; which includes the fol-
lowing attributes:
-&lt;dependency&gt; indicates an identified depend-
ency
-no is the id of identified dependency within cur-
rent sentence according to ordinal sequence
-observing indicates the current observing
headword
-head indicates the head of the identified word
dependency

-modifier_chunk is the hybrid tags for labeling
chunking information of the modifier
-modifier_chunkid is the chunk id of the modi-
fier
-relation gives the syntactic dependency rela-

In S1 and S2, the word combination 确保/v 安全
/an has direct dependency, and in S3, such a de-
pendency does not exist as 确保/v only determines
度汛/v and 安全/an depends on 度汛/v. The qual-
ity of CCB highly depends on the accuracy of de-
pendency annotation. This is very important for
effective characteristics analysis of collocations
and for the collocation extraction algorithms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.477846">
Pass 2. N-gram collocations annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976476190476">
It is relatively easy to identify n-gram colloca-
tions since an n-gram collocation is of habitual and
recurrent use of a series of bi-grams. This means
that n-gram collocations can be identified by find-
ing consecutive occurrence of significant bi-grams
in certain position. In the second pass, the annota-
tors focus on the sentences where the headword
has more than one dependency. The percentage of
all appearances of each dependent word at each
position around the headword is estimated with the
help of a program (Xu and Lu, 2006). Finally,
word dependencies frequently co-occurring in con-
secutive positions in a fixed order are extracted as
n-gram collocations.
For the headword, an n-gram collocation 生命/n
财 产 /n 安 全 /an is identified since the co-
occurrence percentage of dependency 生命/-NN-安
全/an and dependency 财产/n-NN-安全/an is 0.74
is greater than a empirical threshold suggest in (Xu
and Lu, 2006). This n-gram is annotated in S2 as
follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6838115">
&lt;ncolloc observing=&amp;quot;安全/an&amp;quot; w1=&amp;quot;生命/n&amp;quot; w2=&amp;quot;财产/n&amp;quot;

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987166142857143">
where,
-&lt;ncolloc&gt; indicates an n-gram collocation
-w1, w2,..wn give the components of the n-gram
collocation according to the ordinal sequence.
-start_wordid indicates the word id of the first
component of the n-gram collocation.
Since n-gram collocation is regarded as a whole,
its internal dependencies are ignored in the output
file of pass 2. That is, if the dependencies of sev-
eral components are associated with an n-gram
collocation in one sentence, the n-gram collocation
is annotated and these dependencies are filtered out
so as not to disturb the bi-gram dependencies.
Pass 3. Bi-gram collocations annotation
In this pass, all the word dependencies are ex-
amined to identify bi-gram collocations. Further-
more, if a dependent word combination is regarded
as a collocation by the annotators, it will be further
labeled based on the type determined. The identifi-
cation is based on expert knowledge combined
with the use of several computational features as
discussed in (Xu and Lu, 2006).
An assistive tool is developed to estimate the
computational features. We use the program to ob-
tain feature data based on two sets of data. The
first data set is the annotated dependencies in the
5-million-word corpus which is obtained through
Pass 1 and Pass 2 annotations. Because the de-
pendent word combinations are manually identi-
fied and annotated in the first pass, the statistical
significance is helpful to identify whether the word
combination is a collocation and to determine its
type. However, data sparseness problem must be
considered since 5-million-word is not large
enough. Thus, another set of statistical data are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999128">
65
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934727272727">
collected from a 100-million segmented and tagged
corpus (Xu and Lu, 2006). With this large corpus,
data sparseness is no longer a serious problem. But,
the collected statistics are quite noisy since they
are directly retrieved from text without any verifi-
cation. By analyzing the statistical features from
both sets, the annotator can use his/her professional
judgment to determine whether a bi-gram is a col-
location and its collocation type.
In the example sentences, two collocations are
identified. Firstly, 安全/an 度汛/v is classified as a
Type 1 collocation as they have only one peak co-
occurrence, very low substitution ratio and their
co-occurrence order nearly never altered. Secondly,
确保/v 安全/an is identified as a collocation. They
have frequent co-occurrences and they are always
co-occurred in fixed order among the verified de-
pendencies. However, their co-occurrences are dis-
tributed evenly and they have two peak co-
occurrences. Therefore, 确保/v 安全/an is classi-
fied as a Type 3 collocation. These bi-gram collo-
cations are annotated as illustrated below,

The annotators of CCB are three post-graduate stu-
dents majoring in linguistics. In the first annotation
stage, 20% headwords of the whole set was anno-
tated in duplicates by all three of them. Their out-
puts were checked by a program. Annotated collo-
cation including classified dependencies and types
accepted by at least two annotators are reserved in
the final data as the Golden Standard while the
others are considered incorrect. The inconsisten-
cies between different annotators were discussed to
clarify any misunderstanding in order to come up
with the most appropriate annotations. In the sec-
ond annotation stage, 80% of the whole annota-
tions were then divided into three parts and sepa-
rately distributed to the annotators with 5% dupli-
cate headwords were distributed blindly. The du-
plicate annotation data were used to estimate the
annotation consistency between annotators.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983333333333">
Up to now, the first version of CCB is completed.
We have obtained 23,581 unique bi-gram colloca-
tions and 2,752 unique n-gram collocations corre-
sponding to the 3,643 observing headwords.
Meanwhile, their occurrences in the corpus are an-
notated and verified. With the help of a computer
program, the annotators manually classified bi-
gram collocations into three types. The numbers of
Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 collocations are 152,
3,982 and 19,447, respectively.
For the 3,643 headwords in The Dictionary of
Modern Chinese Collocations (Mei 1999) with
35,742 bi-gram collocations, 20,035 collocations
appear in the corpus. We call this collection as
Mei’s Collocation Collection (MCC). There are
19,967 common entries in MCC and CCB, which
means 99.7% collocations in MCC appear in CCB
indicating a good linguistic consistency. Further-
more, 3,614 additional collocations are found in
CCB which enriches the static collocation diction-
ary.

It is observed that about 90% bi-gram collocations
have only one dependency type. This indicates that
a collocation normally has only one fixed syntactic
dependency. It is also observed that about 10% bi-
gram collocations have more than one dependency
type, especially Type 3 collocations. For example,
two types of dependencies are identified in the bi-
gram collocation 安全/an-国家/n. They are 安全
/an-AN-国家/n (a safe nation) which indicates the
dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier
where 国家/n serves as the head, and 国家/n-NN-
安全/an (national security) which indicates the
dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier
where 安全/an serves as the head. It is attributed to
the fact that the use of Chinese words is flexible. A
Chinese word may support different part-of-speech.
A collocation with different dependencies results
in different distribution trends and most of these
collocations are classified as Type 3. On the other
hand, Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations seldom
have more than one dependency type.

Table 4. The statistics of collocations with dif-

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741205128205">
Corresponding to 23,581 bi-gram collocations,
25,793 types of dependencies are identified (some
collocations have more than one types of depend-
ency). In which, about 82% belongs to five major
dependency types. They are AN, VO, NN, ADV and
SBV. It is note-worthy that the percentage of NN
collocation is much higher than that in English.
This is because nouns are more often used in paral-
lel to serve as one syntactic component in Chinese
sentences than in English.
The percentages of Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3
collocations in CCB are 0.6%, 16.9% and 82.5%,
respectively. However, the collocations with dif-
ferent types of dependencies have shown their own
characteristics with respect to different collocation
types. The collocations with CMP, NJX and NN
dependencies on average have higher percentage to
be classified into Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations.
This indicates that CMP, NJX and NN collocations
in Chinese are always used in fixed patterns and
these kinds of collocations are not freely modifi-
able and substitutable. In the contrary, many ADV
and AN collocations are classified as Type 3. This
is partially due to the special usage of auxiliary
words in Chinese. Many AN Chinese collocations
can be inserted by a meaningless auxiliary word 的
/u and many ADV Chinese collocations can be in-
serted by an auxiliary word 地/u. This means that
many AN and ADV collocations can be modified
and thus, they always have two peak co-
occurrences. Therefore, they are classified as Type
3 collocations. 7.7% and 62.5% of the collocations
with dependency OT are classified as Type 0/1 and
Type2 collocations, respectively. Such percentages
are much higher than the average. This is attributed
by the fact that some Type 0/1 and Type 2 colloca-
tions have strong semantic relations rather than
syntactic relations and thus their dependencies are
difficult to label.

5.4 Chunking Statistics of Collocations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964">
The chunking characteristic for the collocations
with different types and different dependencies are
examined. In most cases, Type 0/1/2 collocations
co-occur within one chunk or between neighboring
chunks. Therefore, their chunking characteristics
are not discussed in detail. The percentage of the
occurrences of Type 3 collocations with different
chunking distances are given in Table 5. If a collo-
cation co-occurs within one chunk, the chunking
distance is 0. If a collocation co-occurs between
neighboring chunks, or between neighboring words,
or between a word and a neighboring chunk, the
chunking distance is 1, and so on.

<bodyText confidence="0.99975615">
It is shown that the co-occurrence of collocations
decreases with increased chunking distance. Yet,
the behavior for decrease is different for colloca-
tions with different dependencies. Generally speak-
ing, the ADA, ADV, CMP, NJX, NN and OT collo-
cations seldom co-occur cross two words or two
chunks. Furthermore, the occurrences of AN, NJX
and OT collocations quickly drops when the
chunking distance is greater than 0, i.e. these col-
locations tends to co-occur within the same chunk.
In the contrary, the co-occurrences of ADA, ADV,
CMP, SBV and VV collocations corresponding to
chunking distance equals 0 and 1 decrease steadily.
It means that these four kinds of collocations are
more evenly distributed within the same chunk or
between neighboring words or chunks. The occur-
rences of VO collocations corresponding to chunk-
ing distance from 0 to 3 with a much flatter reduc-
tion. This indicates that a verb may govern its ob-
ject in a long range.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998815">
This paper describes the design and construction of
a manually annotated Chinese collocation bank.
Following a set of well-designed annotation guide-
line, the collocations corresponding to 3,643
headwords are identified from a chunked five-
million word corpus. 2,752 unique n-gram colloca-
tions and 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations are
annotated. Furthermore, each bi-gram collocation
is annotated with its syntactic dependency informa-
tion, classification information and chunking in-
formation. Based on CCB, characteristics of collo-
cations with different types and different depend-
encies are examined. The obtained result is essen-
tial for improving research related to Chinese col-
location. Also, CCB may be used as a standard an-
swer set for evaluating the performance of differ-
ent collocation extraction algorithms. In the future,
collocations of all unvisited headwords will be an-
notated to produce a complete 5-million-word Chi-
nese collocation bank.

A problem is that collocations are word combinations that co-occur within a short context, but not all such co-occurrences are true collocations. Further examinations is needed to filter out pseudo-collocations once co-occurred word pairs are identified. A collocation bank with true collocations annotated is naturally an indispensable resource for collocation research. (Kosho et al. 2000) presented their works of collocation annotation on Japanese text. Also, the Turkish treebank, (Bedin 2003) included collocation annotation as one step in its annotation. These two collocation banks provided collocation identification and co-occurrence verification information. (Tutin 2005) used shallow analysis based on finite state transducers and lexicon-grammar to identify and annotate collocations in a French corpus. This collocation bank further provided the lexical functions of the collocations. However to this day, there is no reported Chinese collocation bank available. 61 Proceedings of the Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 61–68, Prague, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computationa</context>

Consequently, collocation knowledge is widely employed in natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation, machine translation, information retrieval and natural language generation (Manning et al. 1999). Although the importance of collocation is well known, it is difficult to compile a complete collocation dictionary. There are some existing corpus linguistic researches on automatic extraction of collocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993; Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006). These techniques are mainly based on statistical techniques and syntactic analysis. However, the performances of automatic collocation extraction systems are not satisfactory (Pecina 2005).

The first one is the syntactic dependency of the headword and its co-word in a bi-gram collocation . A syntactic dependency normally consists of one word as the governor (or head), a dependency type and another word serves 62 as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10 types of dependencies are annotated in CCB.

The accuracies of word segmentation and POS tagging are claimed to be higher than 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu et al. 2001). The use of this popular and accurate raw resource helped to reduce the cost of annotation significantly, and ensured maximal sharing of our output. The set of 3, 643 headwords are selected from “The Dictionary of Modern Chinese Collocation” (Mei 1999) among about 6,000 headwords in the dictionary. The selection was based both on the judgment by linguistic experts as well as the statistical information that they are commonly used. 4.2 Corpus Preprocessing The CCB annotations are represented in XML. Since collocations are practical word combinations and word is the basic unit in collocation research, a preprocessing module is devised to transfer the chunked sentences in the PolyU chunk bank to word sequences with the appropriate labels to indicate the corresponding chunking information.

We have obtained 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations and 2,752 unique n-gram collocations corresponding to the 3,643 observing headwords. Meanwhile, their occurrences in the corpus are annotated and verified. With the help of a computer program, the annotators manually classified bigram collocations into three types. The numbers of Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 collocations are 152, 3,982 and 19,447, respectively. For the 3,643 headwords in The Dictionary of Modern Chinese Collocations (Mei 1999) with 35,742 bi-gram collocations, 20,035 collocations appear in the corpus. We call this collection as Mei’s Collocation Collection (MCC). There are 19,967 common entries in MCC and CCB, which means 99.7% collocations in MCC appear in CCB indicating a good linguistic consistency. Furthermore, 3,614 additional collocations are found in CCB which enriches the static collocation dictionary. 5.2 Dependencies Numbers Statistics of Collocations Firstly, we study the statistics of how many types of dependencies a bi-gram collocation may have.

There are some existing corpus linguistic researches on automatic extraction of collocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993; Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006). These techniques are mainly based on statistical techniques and syntactic analysis. However, the performances of automatic collocation extraction systems are not satisfactory (Pecina 2005).

Chunking information identifies all the words for a collocation within the context of an enclosed chunk. Thus, it is a way to identify its proper context at the most immediate syntactic structure. 11 types of syntactic chunking categories given in (Xu and 2006) are used as listed in Table 2.

Type 3 collocations are modifiable meaning that they allow modifier insertions. Type 3 collocations have weak internal associations and they must have statistically significant co-occurrence. The classification represents the strength of internal associations of collocated words. The annotation of these three kinds of information is essential to all-rounded characteristic analysis of collocations. 63 4 Annotation of CCB 4.1 Data Preparation CCB is based on the PolyU chunk bank (Xu and Lu, 2005) which contains chunking information on the People’s Daily corpus with both segmentation and part-of-speech tags. The accuracies of word segmentation and POS tagging are claimed to be higher than 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu et al. 2001). The use of this popular and accurate raw resource helped to reduce the cost of annotation significantly, and ensured maximal sharing of our output.

The chunking categories The third one is the classification of collocation types. Collocations cover a wide spectrum of habitual word combinations ranging from idioms to free word combinations. Some collocations are very rigid and some are more flexible. (Xu and Lu 2006) proposed a scheme to classify collocations into four types according to the internal association of collocations including compositionality, nonsubstitutability, non-modifiability, and statistical significance. They are, Type 0: Idiomatic Collocation Type 0 collocations are fully non-compositional as its meaning cannot be predicted from the meanings of its components such as�i7 *Ai (climbing a tree to catch a fish, which is a metaphor for a fruitless endeavour). Some terminologies are also Type 0 collocations such as A F(Blue-tooth ) which refers to a wireless communication protocol. Type 0 c</context>

N-gram collocations annotation It is relatively easy to identify n-gram collocations since an n-gram collocation is of habitual and recurrent use of a series of bi-grams. This means that n-gram collocations can be identified by finding consecutive occurrence of significant bi-grams in certain position. In the second pass, the annotators focus on the sentences where the headword has more than one dependency. The percentage of all appearances of each dependent word at each position around the headword is estimated with the help of a program (Xu and Lu, 2006). Finally, word dependencies frequently co-occurring in consecutive positions in a fixed order are extracted as n-gram collocations. For the headword, an n-gram collocation 生命/n 财 产 /n 安 全 /an is identified since the cooccurrence percentage of dependency 生命/-NN-安 全/an and dependency 财产/n-NN-安全/an is 0.74 is greater than a empirical threshold suggest in (Xu and Lu, 2006). This n-gram is annotated in S2 as follows: &lt;ncolloc observing=&amp;quot;安全/an&amp;quot; w1=&amp;quot;生命/n&amp;quot; w2=&amp;quot;财产/n&amp;quot; w3=&amp;quot;安全/an&amp;quot; start_wordid=&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;/ncolloc&gt; where, -&lt;ncolloc&gt; indicates an n-gram collocation -w1, w2,..wn give the components of the n-gram</context>

Pass 3. Bi-gram collocations annotation In this pass, all the word dependencies are examined to identify bi-gram collocations. Furthermore, if a dependent word combination is regarded as a collocation by the annotators, it will be further labeled based on the type determined. The identification is based on expert knowledge combined with the use of several computational features as discussed in (Xu and Lu, 2006). An assistive tool is developed to estimate the computational features. We use the program to obtain feature data based on two sets of data. The first data set is the annotated dependencies in the 5-million-word corpus which is obtained through Pass 1 and Pass 2 annotations. Because the dependent word combinations are manually identified and annotated in the first pass, the statistical significance is helpful to identify whether the word combination is a collocation and to determine its type. However, data sparseness problem must be considered since 5-million-word is not large enough. Thus, a</context>
