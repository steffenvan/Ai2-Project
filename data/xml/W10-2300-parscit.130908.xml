Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971003836363637">
Recent years have shown an increased amount of interest in applying graph theoretic models
to computational linguistics. Both graph theory and computational linguistics are well studied
disciplines, which have traditionally been perceived as distinct, embracing different algorithms,
different applications, and different potential end-users. However, as recent research work has
shown, the two seemingly distinct disciplines are in fact intimately connected, with a large variety
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications adopting efficient and elegant solutions from
graph-theoretical framework.
The TextGraphs workshop series addresses a broad spectrum of research areas and brings
together specialists working on graph-based models and algorithms for natural language
processing and computational linguistics, as well as on the theoretical foundations of related
graph-based methods. This workshop is aimed at fostering an exchange of ideas by facilitating
a discussion about both the techniques and the theoretical justification of the empirical results
among the NLP community members. Spawning a deeper understanding of the basic theoretical
principles involved, such interaction is vital to the further progress of graph-based NLP
applications.
In addition to the general goal of employing graph-theoretical methods for text processing tasks,
this year we invited papers on a special theme “Graph Methods for Opinion analysis”. One of
the motivations for our special theme was that graphical approaches become very pertinent as
the field of opinion mining advances towards deeper analysis and more complex systems. We
wanted to encourage publication of early results, position papers and initiate discussions of issues
in this area.
This volume contains papers accepted for publication for TextGraphs-5 2010 Workshop on
Graph- Based Algorithms for Natural Language Processing. TextGraphs-5 was held on 16th
of July 2010 in Uppsala, Sweden at ACL 2010, the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics. This was the fifth workshop in this series, building on the successes
of previous workshops that were held at HLT-NAACL (2006, 2007), Coling (2008) and ACL
(2009).
We issued calls for both regular, short and position papers. Six regular and ten short papers were
accepted for presentation, based on the careful reviews of our program committee. We are very
thankful to the incredible program committee, whose detailed comments and useful suggestions
have benefited the papers and helped us to create a great program. We are particularly grateful
for the timely reviews, especially considering that we had a tight schedule.
The articles apply graph methods to a variety of NLP problems such as Word Sense
Disambiguation (De Cao et al., Fagerlund et al., Biemannl), Topic Segmentation (Ambwani
and Davis), Summarization (Jorge and Pardo, Fukumoto and Suzuki), Language Evolution
(Enright), Language Acquisition (German et al.), Language Resources (Archer), Lexical
Networks (Oliveira and Gomes, Gornerup and Karlgren) and Clustering (Wieling and Nerbonne,
Chen and Ji). Additionally, we have selected three papers for our special theme: Zontone et
al. use graph theoretic dominant set clustering algorithm for the annotation of images with
sentiment scores, Amancio et al. employ complex network features to distinguish between
positive and negative opinions, and Tatzl and Waldhauser offer a formalization that could help
to automate opinion extraction within the Media Content Analysis framework.
Last but not the least, having a prominent researcher as the invited speaker significantly added
to the success of our workshop. We would like to thank Professor Edwin Hancock from the
iii
University of York for his captivating talk on graph-based machine learning algorithms. We
are also grateful to the European Community project, EternalS: “Trustworthy Eternal Systems
via Evolving Software, Data and Knowledge” (project number FP7 247758) for sponsoring our
invited speaker.
Enjoy the workshop!
