ON THE SPATIAL USES OF PREPOSITIONS
Annette Herstovits
Linguistics Department, Stanford University
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962444">
At first glance, the spatial uses of prepositions seem
to constitute a good semantic domain for a
computational approach. One expects such uses will
refer more or less strictly to a closed, explicit, and
precise chunk of world knowledge. Such an attitude is
expressed in the following statement:
&amp;quot;Given descriptions of the shape of two objects, given
their location (for example, by means or coordinates in
some system of reference), and, in some cases, the
location of an observer, one can select an appropriate
preposition.&amp;quot;
This paper shows the fallacy of this claim. It
addresses the problem of interpreting and generating
&amp;quot;locative predications&amp;quot; (expressions made up of two
noun-phrases governed by a preposition used spatially).
It identifies and describes a number of object
characteristics beyond shape (section 1) and contextual
factors (section 2) which bear on these processes.
Drawing on these descriptions, the third section
proposes core meanings for two categories of
prepositions, and describes some of the transformations
these core meanings are subject to in context. The last
section outlines the main directions of inquiry
suggested by the examples and observations in the
paper.

1. OBJECT CHARACTERUTICS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99917125">
Throughout the paper, I use the term &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;, meaning,
strictly speaking, the object together with some
lexical label. in effect, the choice of preposition
depends on the lexical category associated with the
object by the noun-phrase used to refer to it. And such
a category is not uniquely defined. There are different
levels in the categorization hierarchy (e.g. &amp;quot;end
table&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;table&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;piece of furniture&amp;quot;), but also
different perspectives on the object. Consider the
picture below.
That patch of grass could be referred to alternately as
a front-yard, a lawn, emu, a patch of grass, etc. (to assume
that these phrases refer to the same object, one must
see the grass as a metonymic substitute for this !souk of
grass, and the frantlard as some &amp;quot;area&amp;quot; rather than a
&amp;quot;slice&amp;quot; including, air above and ground under; neither
view is unreasonable). The permissible prepositions,
and their interpretation, vary with each referring
phrase: compare in/on the grass, in/on the patch offsets, in/(son)
rlie frontlard, on/(&apos;&apos;In) the lawn (Fillmore 1971). With this
warning, I will go on speaking of &amp;quot;object
characteristics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;object identity&amp;quot;, etc.
Some of the object characteristics used in production
and interpretation can be computed from the shape of
the objects -- the axes of symmetry (needed for am/ the
road and along the road), the &amp;quot;top surface&amp;quot; (on the (able), the
&amp;quot;outline&amp;quot; (the bird in the tree), etc. (for a description of
some of these characteristics, and of their role in

Other characteristics are not deducible from shape.

Objects identical in shape may be &amp;quot;conceived&amp;quot;
differently, for instance as surface or as enclosure.
This may be a choice available to the speaker to
emphasize certain aspects Union the rug), or it may be
determined for the category of the reference object (on
the football field).
In under the water, the water stands for da upper free surface
of the water; in in the water, it is conceived as a volume. A
whole category of objects follows this rule: see
(under/In) the (snowilakeloceankandl_). Such objects tend to be
viewed only as volumes with &amp;quot;underneath&amp;quot;: underneath the
lake is generally interpreted as meaning &amp;quot;under the
lower surface of that body of water&amp;quot;.
In the crack in the bowl, the crack is in the volume defined
by the normal surface of the bowl in its uncracked
state. In the mdk in the Nnd, .the milk is in the volume
enclosed by the bowl and limited upward by a plane
through the rim.

1.3. TYPICAL PHYSICAL OR GEOMETRICAL CONTEXT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999533235294118">
When using in with areas, it is not sufficient that the
reference object be two-dimensional; that object must
be part of a surface divided into cells. One does not
draw a line in a blackboard; but in Ow margin Is acceptable,
because the margin is a subdivision of a page. In the
same fashion, &apos;geographical areas (England, the county,
etc.) are sections of a divided surface. Some objects
are exclusively conceptualized as parts of a &amp;quot;cell
structure&amp;quot; and cannot then follow at Oat his room, tat
England). Other objects can be conceptualized both as
elements of a cell structure (in the village), or as one of
a set of separate places (at the village). Or consider yard:
when it is a part of the grounds of a house, one is
restricted to in. But of somebody working in a junkyard,
one could say he is at the yard, reflecting a view of the
yard as one of a set of separate locations.
If a door is in its typical context, i.e. part of a

wall, then interpretation of to 04 right of 04 lamw must be
based on the door&apos;s own axes. Otherwise (in a hardware
store for example) an observer&apos;s line of sight may
override the door&apos;s cross-axis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.906588">
1.4. RELATIVE MOBILITY
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996688363636364">
The mobility of the reference object relative to the
located object influences the order of the nominals
around the preposition: the more mobile object normally
precedes the preposition. One will not say 04 cognac bottle
is the one In a cap, but the one with a cap on U. Following Tally
(1978a), I will call the located object the &amp;quot;Figure&amp;quot;,
and the reference object the &amp;quot;Ground&amp;quot;, when discussing
the order of the nominals.
Human beings tend to play havoc with the relative
mobility rule, either because they are the preferred
topic (the man in a blue cot), or -- as center of the
universe -- preferred reference object (the Empire State
building 0 in front of me).
tee
Typicality, plays an important role in determining an
appropriate locative predication (and no doubt other
types of expressions). The choice of expression tends
to depend not on particular (non prototypical)
attributes of the objects considered, but rather on
typical attributes of the category to which they are
assigned by the linguistic expression. If typical
conditions do not obtain, they tend to be ignored,
unless one has some special reason to bring attention
to the atypical conditions. If for instance the cap of
a bottle were glued to the wall, one would still say the
bottle with a cap on U. Even if a tray has very high sides,
one will say on the tray. Consider also the table pictured
above. Imagine the space under it progressively more
solidly enclosed; there is a point at which one might
be struck by this and say in the mioie. But this point is
rather far along; even with a table with a solid shelf
at floor level, people consistently describe objects on
that shelf as under the table.

2. CONTEXTUA4 FACTORS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749428571429">
The choice of an appropriate locative predication elsc
depends on various aspects of the context. Some of
these contextual characteristics are discussed in this
section as if they were neatly separable; in fact, all
are interdependent in complex ways, and these
interrrelations must become clear before we can design
models of comprehension and production.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.698564">
2.1. CONTEXT DEPENDENT PARAMETERS.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99856475">
These include the location of an observer, for the
deictic uses of some prepositions (infromt#the trot), and
an implicit (fuzzy) distance threshold for the
prepositions indicating proximity (Denofsky 19763.
In the gas-nation is at the freeway, an implicit cross-path is
assumed. To say that &amp;quot;freeway&amp;quot; occurs as a metonymic
substitute for &amp;quot;at the intersection of a cross-road
with the freeway&amp;quot; is not very useful, since no general
rule of metonymy will predict this one .(as natural as
such a substitution may sound to English speakers, it
is not acceptable in French: see *0 poste Jammu est a /a
route).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.759445">
2.2. FIGURE/GROUND AS. )GNMENT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877037037037">
The assignment of the roles of Figure and Ground
depends primarily on which of the two objects&apos; location
is at issue. The object whose location is at issue
precedes the preposition: compare 04 house near the church
and the church near the house. But the assigment must also
respect the relative mobility Tule. The how near the than:A
is reversible because both house and church are equally
immobile; but the bicycle near the church is not. When one
wishes to locate a less mobile object with respect to a
more mobile one, there are a number of periphrastic
devices one tieing the use of &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; as in the
earlier example (the bottle with a cap on U); &amp;quot;with&amp;quot;, not
being basically locative, is not subject to this
relative mobility rule. See also 04 houst is near where the
bicycle is (but *the house is near 04 key&amp; (&apos;relay 1978a1); this
turns bicycle into an immovable entity, namely a place.
The mobility rule is in fact a consequence of the
principle that the object whose location is at issue
should precede the preposition. The Ground is typically
bigger and less mobile than the Figure, since those
objects whose location is most commonly at issue are
those which move around, and a good reference object is
one whose location can be inferred from its name, and
thus had better be the same over some time.
What is at issue in turn depends on the speaker&apos;s
purpose in constructing the locative predication, and
how it fits into his/her overall discourse plan.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.61837">
2.1. VARYING VIEWPOINT ON THE OBJECT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998985625">
Mainly this involves the contrast between a close-up
and a remote view of the objects. Most often, this is
not a matter of actual distance, but a way of viewing
an object for a given purpose: one may choose to ignore
one or more dimensions, or internal characteristics of
the object. For example, a road may be seen as a strip
(a truth on the road), or a line (a village on the mud to Londen).
Normally behind the &amp;nue will be based on the house&apos;s own
axes. But when looking from some distance, one may use
one&apos;s line of sight as axis.
Another aspect of viewpoint, is the bounded/unbounded
distinction. Compare walking through versus across 04 water
(Talmy 1978b1: in the former the boundaries of the body
of water are ignored, but in the latter, the extension
of the body of water from one end to another is
involved.

The socket is still functioning as a socket when facing
down, the bowl not as a bowl. If function is the
relevant aspect, it is of no interest to distinguish
between situations where bulb and socket are as above,

distinction matters.
Similarly, the pear in B is in the bond. It is not
normally useful to distinguish between situation A and
B.

language should account for this possibility.
A locative expression may describe the general
intention of a person over some time, rather than his
precise location at the time of speaking. I could say
Lynn 43.41 the sore even if.1 knew .Lynn might still, be on
her way. But this nay. not be appropriate (e.g. If I
know the addressee is at the store).
Relevance is important for Gricean inferences. For
instance, from fon is near his desk, one can generally infer
Jon IS not at his desk. If however 1 asked a friend on the
phone &amp;quot;are you near your desk? could you look up the
address...&amp;quot;, an appropriate answer is &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, even if my
friend is at his/her desk. In this context proximity is
the relevant aspect, and &amp;quot;near&amp;quot; becomes appropriate.

2.6. HIGHLIGHTING SOME BACKGROUND ELEMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882666666667">
The choice between expressions is often a matter of
bringing attention to some background element rather
than signalling differences of fact Thus to the right, as
contrasted with on the right, tends to highlight the
distance between the two objects, and to evoke travel
away from the reference object; the contrast cannot
always be described in terms of objective differences
in the situations (it sometimes is: thus if a third
object of the same kind is between the two considered,
only to the rig/it is appropriate). And on the right side of the
building as contrasted with on the rig/it of the building brings
attention to the wall. Consider also Bogota is at/on the
equator; &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; will be preferred if one wishes to signal
the presence of some transverse line (e.g. a travel

<bodyText confidence="0.999819">
Most spatial relations are true given a certain
tolerance. The tolerance has a lower limit defined by
the nature of the objects; its effective value depends
on one&apos;s purpose, and the precision of one&apos;s knowledge.
Thus, the angular precision with which directly to 04 right

<bodyText confidence="0.996746423076923">
&amp;quot;Polar concepts&amp;quot;, i.e. terms like to the right, may behave
like Implicit comparatives. In some sense, to the right is
better realized the closer the located object is to the
&amp;quot;right axis&amp;quot;. Thus, if I said put the chair to the rig/it of the
desk, I would expect you to put it more or less on the
right axis of the desk. And, in the figure below, A is to
the right of B only in the absence of C. The location of A
must be contrasted with that of similar objects in the
relevant part of space.
A

A is diagonally to the rig/it of B. This suggests that even in
the presence of C, A is to the right of B is true, but
&amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; (Grice 1974). However, it is
&amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; precisely because of some intrinsic
property of the concept to the rig/it -- i.e. because
&amp;quot;closer to the axis&amp;quot; is in some sense a better way to
realize to the right. Even if one grants some usefulness to
the semantic/pragmatic distinction, it does not neatly
apply here.)
A similar use of contrast can be seen with the chair is in

2.9. OTHERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991618125">
Many uses of the prepositions cannot be explained in
terms of any of the above factors. One then needs a
description of the context of use at a rather specific
level. Consider for example the contexts in which one
will say Suzy is at the playground versus in the playground. In
would be (1) preferred if the speaker can see Suzy,
(ii) required if the addressee expects Suzy to be just
outside the playground, (iii) required if the speaker
her/himself is in the playground (an analogous contrast
exists between at the beach and on the beach). These
conditions &amp;quot;suggest&amp;quot; a close-up view, and that the
speaker&apos;s knowledge is precise; by contrast, &amp;quot;at&amp;quot;
suggests a remote view, and imprecise knowledge. But
&amp;quot;to suggest&amp;quot; is not to imply: one cannot infer these
conditions of use from the ideas of a remote versus a
close-up view.

3. ong MEANINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979964210526316">
With most of the examples given, the explanation
suggested for the choice of a preposition assumes the
existence of a &amp;quot;core meaning&amp;quot;. This core meaning is
basically a geometrical relationship between
geometrical entities. Thus, in a given context,
&amp;quot;geometrical descriptions&amp;quot; (say a point, line, surface,
volume, lamina, etc.) are mapped onto the subject and
object of the preposition. Strictly speaking, the core
meanings are -- at best -- true only of these geometric
descriptions. In fact, they may not even hold for any
such geometric description -- see the pear in a bond
example above, assuming the natural core meaning for
&amp;quot;in&amp;quot;, i.e. &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot;. Yet, the core meaning is then
present as &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot;.
Here are informal definitions of the core meanings for
two categories of prepositions, designated as
&amp;quot;topological&amp;quot; (at, an, in), and &amp;quot;projective&amp;quot; ho the rig/it,
behind, etc.).
.,book
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.986807">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990343481481482">
Topological prepositions:
in: partial inclusion of a geometrical construct in a
volume, an area, or a line.
an: contiguity, adjacency of a geometrical construct
with a surface, or a line.
at: coincidence of .a point with a point in space.
In actual context, inclusion, contiguity, and
coincidence need not be true. Thus the book on top of a
pile of books on the table can be said on the table, and
Afar, is at the gate when very close to it. But the relations
represent the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; around which particular instances
gravitate. Thus at implies the closest reasonable
relationship between two objects, and coincidence where
sensible (Me center of the circle if of the Intersection of the axes). Of
course, the core meanings are not sufficient to
determine the conditions of use of a given preposition:
one must also know precisely which deviations from the
ideal are permitted. One principal process mediating
between core meanings and actual conditions of use is
the mapping of objects onto points, surfaces, and
volumes.
I am not saying that the core meanings presented here
are the only possible ones. Only when core meanings are
incorporated in a global explanatory system will it be
possible to make rigorous arguments for alternate
choices. Those proposed here represent a good starting
point.
Projective prepositions:
Each of these prepositions involves -- through fact,
supposition, or metaphor -- a &amp;quot;point of observation&amp;quot;. A
point of observation consists of two vectors, one
indicating the intrinsic vertical of the observer (it
will not be the gravitational vertical if the observer
is lying down, or not in the gravitational field), and
the other orthogonal to the first along the line of
sight. These two vectors completely specify four
coplanar orthogonal half-line axes associated with the
point of observation: the &amp;quot;front&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;back&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;left&amp;quot; axes, in clockwise order.
In the core meaning definition of these prepositions,
reference and located objects are points. Given a point
of observation, one can specify axes associated with
the reference object -- the &amp;quot;base axes&amp;quot; (right, left,
front, and back) by reference to which to the nght, behind,
etc., will be defined. These axes originate at the
reference object. If the point of observation (Pobs)
coincides with the reference object (PRef ) (figure A
below), the base axes are identical to those of the
point of observation. If the point of observation is
away from the reference object (figure B), the base
axes are a mirror image of those of the point of
observation -- the mirror plane being the bisector of
the segment joining point of observation to reference
object.

PObv
A
There are thus two possible orders of the base axes, as
shown in A and B.
I will define the core meaning of each projective
preposition as follows: given a punctual reference
object (PRef), punctual located object (PLec), and a
point of observation, base axes can be constructed
according to the procedure outlined above: PLec is to the
left: of PRef iff it is located on the left base axis.
Analogous definitions for the other prepositions are
easy to formulate.
A few examples will help understand how these cdre
meanings are manifest in the actual uses of the
prepositions.
In in front of a rolling acme, the point of observation is
&amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot;-- i.e. it is an hypothetical location and
direction for viewing: the location is coincident with
the stone,, and the direction is the direction of
movement. One must of course assume -- as with the
objects in the examples that follow -- that the stone
is asimilated to a point.
In to the right of the chair, the base axes may be specified as
those intrinsic to the chair -- i.e. by reference to a
typical user. The point of observation is then
coincident with the reference object -- namely the
chair. Coincidence may be the case when the base axes
are not intrinsic to the reference object: for instance
on the net of the stool may be defined with respect to
somebody sitting on it, given a round stool with no
Intrinsic front axis.
Reference object and point of observation are separated
in the moon behind the cloud. They can also be separated when
the base axes are intrinsic to the reference object:
with an Me right side of the closet, the point of observation is
defined by a typical user facing the closet.
Again, one might define the core meanings differently.
In .particular one could define the core meaning of &amp;quot;to
the right&amp;quot; say, as implying location in the whole
right-hand half-space instead of on the axis. The
choice adopted here reflects the fact noted in earlier
examples that the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; realization of to the nchf is
with the located object on the right base axis.
Processes other than the mapping of objects onto points
may mediate between core meanings and actual conditions
of use. The reference object aay rotate: where is on the
right nMM of the painting when the painting is tilted? The nee
to the right of the road actually means &amp;quot;at some point of the
road&amp;quot; -- think of a curving road), and the city behind the
barbed wire fence assumes &amp;quot;Integration&amp;quot; along the length of
the fence (note one cannot say the city to the right of Me fence
to the same effect -- that is referring in this way to
the whole city. The line of sight is a favored axis, as
compared to right, left, and back axes).

Here are the main problems and directions of inquiry
suggested by the examples in this paper.
One cannot fully explain the use of a locative
predication in a given situation in terms of the core
meanings together with some inferences from general
principles involving object knowledge, salience,
relevance, the precision desired, etc. There will
always remain uses involving some degree of
arbitrariness (most uses are &amp;quot;motivated&amp;quot;, if not
&amp;quot;compositional&amp;quot; (Fillmore 1979] -- i.e. the morphemes
composing the appropriate expression are normally
selected from &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; candidates). Even where Such
principles are at play, they may operate not at the
comprehension/production level, but rather at the

phylogenetic level. To sort principled aspects of use
from arbitrary ones, and to understand exactly where
such principles operate, one must of course first
establish their existence and nature.
In terms of knowledge of the physical world, I believe
one important step toward adequate representations is
to put the experiencer back into the picture. That is,
it is not enough -- or even always necessary -- to know
where what objects are; one must also consider how much
fits into one field of view, how things &amp;quot;appear&amp;quot; as
opposed to how they &amp;quot;are&amp;quot;, how this changes with
viewing distance, visibility, obstruction, etc.
General principles of salience should Lie studied: how
some object parts or relations are selected as most
important -- either in all imaginable contexts, or in
some contexts. Salience underlies many instances of
metonymy (in at the front of the theatre, &amp;quot;theatre&amp;quot; actually
refers to the part occupied by the audience).
Many questions revolve around the issue of &amp;quot;relevance&amp;quot;
-- of &amp;quot;what matters, to whom, in what circumstances&amp;quot;
rather than the traditional concern with what is true.
All existing artificial intelligence programs have
Ignored this problem by using a limited vocabulary in a
limited domain, so that the question of selecting
relevant utterances never arises.
Relevance is linked to the speaker&apos;s purpose, as many
of the contextual factors described in this paper --
indeterminacy, Gricean inferences, highlighting of
background elements, determination of the Figure/Ground
relationship, etc. The set of &amp;quot;expressible&amp;quot; goals is
constrained by the &amp;quot;potential&amp;quot; of the language, i.e. by
a semantic system with finitely many options. One can
only want to say what can be said, and said in a
reasonable amount of time. Clearly, &amp;quot;planning&amp;quot; for
natural language processing Is a very important
problem.
Purpose however, will not explain everything one says.
Simple associative mechanisms must sometimes be
responsible for what one says. For instance, some
background element may be highlighted -- provided some
linguistic means to do so exists -- only because some
passive associative link has brought it to attention.
Once general principles are better understood, it is an
open question whether they are used by speakers, or
whether their explanatory power is at the phylogenetic
level (and will thus be only implicit in the structure
of the knowledge representation). For instance,
although there is a general principle that the located
object should be more mobile than the reference object,
production may not proceed by inferences from this
general principle together with scenarios involving the
two objects. The linguistic expression (or pattern for
expressions) may be attached to some representation of
a &amp;quot;situation type&amp;quot; ,involving the two objects (or two
superordinate objects). And although &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; generally
implies the closest reasonable relationship between two
objects, such a definition may never be used by a
speaker -- or used only in the creation or
understanding of novel types of expressions, metaphors,
witticisms, etc.
What speakers do, and what computer models of
comprehension and production processes should be made
to do, are two different things: the latter depends on
the constructer&apos;s goals, which should be subjected to
some scrutiny.
A computational treatment of the use of prepositions
will require much greater sophistication than naive
representation theory would lead us to expect.

<abstract confidence="0.999293415584417">At first glance, the spatial uses of prepositions seem to constitute a good semantic domain for a computational approach. One expects such uses will refer more or less strictly to a closed, explicit, and precise chunk of world knowledge. Such an attitude is expressed in the following statement: &amp;quot;Given descriptions of the shape of two objects, given their location (for example, by means or coordinates in some system of reference), and, in some cases, the location of an observer, one can select an appropriate preposition.&amp;quot; This paper shows the fallacy of this claim. It addresses the problem of interpreting and generating &amp;quot;locative predications&amp;quot; (expressions made up of two noun-phrases governed by a preposition used spatially). It identifies and describes a number of object characteristics beyond shape (section 1) and contextual factors (section 2) which bear on these processes. Drawing on these descriptions, the third section proposes core meanings for two categories of prepositions, and describes some of the transformations these core meanings are subject to in context. The last section outlines the main directions of inquiry suggested by the examples and observations in the paper. CHARACTERUTICS Throughout the paper, I use the term &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;, meaning, strictly speaking, the object together with some label. effect, choice of preposition depends on the lexical category associated with the object by the noun-phrase used to refer to it. And such a category is not uniquely defined. There are different levels in the categorization hierarchy (e.g. &amp;quot;end table&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;table&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;piece of furniture&amp;quot;), but also different perspectives on the object. Consider the picture below. That patch of grass could be referred to alternately as emu, a patch (to assume that these phrases refer to the same object, one must a metonymic substitute for !souk the some &amp;quot;area&amp;quot; rather than a &amp;quot;slice&amp;quot; including, air above and ground under; neither view is unreasonable). The permissible prepositions, their interpretation, vary referring compare the the patch frontlard, on/(&apos;&apos;In) the lawn 1971). With this warning, I will go on speaking of &amp;quot;object characteristics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;object identity&amp;quot;, etc. Some of the object characteristics used in production and interpretation can be computed from the shape of objects -the axes of symmetry (needed for am/ the road), &amp;quot;top surface&amp;quot; (able), bird in the tree), (for a description of some of these characteristics, and of their role in comprehension, see (Boggess 19791). Other characteristics are not deducible from shape. These include: ALTERNATE DESCRIPTIONS Objects identical in shape may be &amp;quot;conceived&amp;quot; differently, for instance as surface or as enclosure. This may be a choice available to the speaker to certain aspects rug), it may be for the category of the reference object the football field). water, water stands for free surface water; the water, is conceived as a volume. A whole category of objects follows this rule: see the (snowilakeloceankandl_). objects tend to be only as volumes with &amp;quot;underneath&amp;quot;: generally interpreted as meaning &amp;quot;under the lower surface of that body of water&amp;quot;. crack is in the volume defined by the normal surface of the bowl in its uncracked In mdk milk is in the volume enclosed by the bowl and limited upward by a plane through the rim. 1.2. FUNCTION says on these objects may be essentially identical in shape. One will not say cat is table, the table, with the cage-like table below. is at X means that John is using X as one uses it at normal use being X, not (John is bed, but not right chair defined by reference to a typical user of the chair. TYPICAL PHYSICAL OR GEOMETRICAL using areas, it is not sufficient that the reference object be two-dimensional; that object must be part of a surface divided into cells. One does not a line blackboard; margin acceptable, because the margin is a subdivision of a page. In the fashion, &apos;geographical areas the county, etc.) are sections of a divided surface. Some objects are exclusively conceptualized as parts of a &amp;quot;cell and cannot then follow Oat his room, tat objects can both as of a cell structure the village), as one of set of separate places village). consider when it is a part of the grounds of a house, one is to of somebody working in a junkyard, could say is at the yard, a view of the yard as one of a set of separate locations. If a door is in its typical context, i.e. part of a 1 then interpretation of right 04 must be based on the door&apos;s own axes. Otherwise (in a hardware store for example) an observer&apos;s line of sight may override the door&apos;s cross-axis. 1.4. RELATIVE MOBILITY The mobility of the reference object relative to the located object influences the order of the nominals the more mobile object normally the preposition. One will not say bottle one In one with a cap on U. Tally (1978a), I will call the located object the &amp;quot;Figure&amp;quot;, and the reference object the &amp;quot;Ground&amp;quot;, when discussing the order of the nominals. Human beings tend to play havoc with the relative mobility rule, either because they are the preferred man in blue or -as center of the -preferred reference object Empire State 0 tee an important role in determining an appropriate locative predication (and no doubt other types of expressions). The choice of expression tends to depend not on particular (non prototypical) attributes of the objects considered, but rather on typical attributes of the category to which they are assigned by the linguistic expression. If typical conditions do not obtain, they tend to be ignored, unless one has some special reason to bring attention to the atypical conditions. If for instance the cap of bottle were glued to the wall, one would still say a cap on if a tray has very high sides, will say the tray. also the table pictured above. Imagine the space under it progressively more solidly enclosed; there is a point at which one might struck by this and say the mioie. this point is rather far along; even with a table with a solid shelf at floor level, people consistently describe objects on shelf as table. FACTORS choice of locative predication elsc depends on various aspects of the context. Some of these contextual characteristics are discussed in this section as if they were neatly separable; in fact, all are interdependent in complex ways, and these interrrelations must become clear before we can design models of comprehension and production. 2.1. CONTEXT DEPENDENT PARAMETERS. These include the location of an observer, for the uses of some prepositions an implicit (fuzzy) distance threshold for the prepositions indicating proximity (Denofsky 19763. gas-nation the freeway, cross-path is assumed. To say that &amp;quot;freeway&amp;quot; occurs as a metonymic substitute for &amp;quot;at the intersection of a cross-road with the freeway&amp;quot; is not very useful, since no general of metonymy will predict this one natural as such a substitution may sound to English speakers, it not acceptable in French: see Jammu route). 2.2. FIGURE/GROUND AS. )GNMENT The assignment of the roles of Figure and Ground depends primarily on which of the two objects&apos; location is at issue. The object whose location is at issue the preposition: compare church church house. the assigment must also the relative mobility Tule. how near the is reversible because both house and church are equally but bicycle not. When one wishes to locate a less mobile object with respect to a more mobile one, there are a number of periphrastic devices one tieing the use of &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; as in the example bottle a on U); not being basically locative, is not subject to this mobility rule. See also houst where is near 04 1978a1); this an immovable entity, namely a The mobility rule is in fact a consequence of the principle that the object whose location is at issue should precede the preposition. The Ground is typically bigger and less mobile than the Figure, since those objects whose location is most commonly at issue are those which move around, and a good reference object is one whose location can be inferred from its name, and thus had better be the same over some time. What is at issue in turn depends on the speaker&apos;s purpose in constructing the locative predication, and how it fits into his/her overall discourse plan. 2.1. VARYING VIEWPOINT ON THE OBJECT Mainly this involves the contrast between a close-up and a remote view of the objects. Most often, this is not a matter of actual distance, but a way of viewing an object for a given purpose: one may choose to ignore one or more dimensions, or internal characteristics of the object. For example, a road may be seen as a strip a line on the to Londen). the &amp;nue based on the house&apos;s own axes. But when looking from some distance, one may use one&apos;s line of sight as axis. Another aspect of viewpoint, is the bounded/unbounded Compare through (Talmy 1978b1: in the former the boundaries of the body of water are ignored, but in the latter, the extension of the body of water from one end to another is involved. 2.4. RELEVANCE the pictures below, one will say OW bulb in the The socket is still functioning as a socket when facing down, the bowl not as a bowl. If function is the relevant aspect, it is of no interest to distinguish between situations where bulb and socket are as above, and their upside down versions. With the bowl, this distinction matters. the pear in B is It is not normally useful to distinguish between situation A and B. A For the two examples just described, one could contrive contexts in which the distinctions normally ignored would be important. And certainly adequate models of 2 language should account for this possibility. A locative expression may describe the general intention of a person over some time, rather than his precise location at the time of speaking. I could say sore if.1 knew .Lynn might still, be on her way. But this nay. not be appropriate (e.g. If I know the addressee is at the store). Relevance is important for Gricean inferences. For from is near can generally infer at his desk. however 1 asked a friend on the phone &amp;quot;are you near your desk? could you look up the address...&amp;quot;, an appropriate answer is &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, even if my friend is at his/her desk. In this context proximity is the relevant aspect, and &amp;quot;near&amp;quot; becomes appropriate. 2. 5. SALIENCE book below left Is the wthh, lid (right) is not, because the intervening relation between the lid and the jar is salient. Such salience is not primarily a matter of the size of some intervening object. generally says that X is field the kmd, whenever field or bowl contain X. One may however say dust on the bowl, on the field. adhering thin lamina brings attention to contact rather than inclusion. 2.6. HIGHLIGHTING SOME BACKGROUND ELEMENT The choice between expressions is often a matter of bringing attention to some background element rather signalling differences of fact Thus the with right, to highlight the distance between the two objects, and to evoke travel away from the reference object; the contrast cannot always be described in terms of objective differences in the situations (it sometimes is: thus if a third object of the same kind is between the two considered, the rig/it And the right side contrasted with the rig/it building to the wall. Consider also is at/on the be preferred if one wishes to signal the presence of some transverse line (e.g. a travel trajectory). 2.7. INDETERMINACY Most spatial relations are true given a certain tolerance. The tolerance has a lower limit defined by the nature of the objects; its effective value depends on one&apos;s purpose, and the precision of one&apos;s knowledge. the angular precision with which right is defined varies with silverware on the table, chess pieces on a board, or houses on a block. 2.8. CONTRAST concepts&amp;quot;, i.e. terms like the behave Implicit comparatives. In some sense, the right better realized the closer the located object is to the axis&amp;quot;. Thus, if I said the rig/it expect you to put it more or less on the axis of the desk. And, in the figure below, is right in the absence of C. The location of A must be contrasted with that of similar objects in the relevant part of space. A could however say here: is the right and behind B, to the rig/it B. suggests that even in presence of C, is the right true, but &amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; (Grice 1974). However, it is &amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; precisely because of some intrinsic of the concept the rig/it because &amp;quot;closer to the axis&amp;quot; is in some sense a better way to the right. if one grants some usefulness to the semantic/pragmatic distinction, it does not neatly apply here.) similar use of contrast can be seen with chair is the figure below. It is not appropriate unless the armchair be removed. concept of a &amp;quot;corner&amp;quot; has built in that becomes less appropriate as one gets further from the vertex itself. 2.9. OTHERS Many uses of the prepositions cannot be explained in terms of any of the above factors. One then needs a description of the context of use at a rather specific level. Consider for example the contexts in which one say Suzy is the playground would be (1) preferred if the speaker can see Suzy, (ii) required if the addressee expects Suzy to be just the playground, (iii) required if her/himself is in the playground (an analogous contrast the beach the conditions &amp;quot;suggest&amp;quot; a close-up view, and that the speaker&apos;s knowledge is precise; by contrast, &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; suggests a remote view, and imprecise knowledge. But &amp;quot;to suggest&amp;quot; is not to imply: one cannot infer these the ideas of a remote versus a close-up view. ongMEANINGS With most of the examples given, the explanation suggested for the choice of a preposition assumes the existence of a &amp;quot;core meaning&amp;quot;. This core meaning is basically a geometrical relationship between geometrical entities. Thus, in a given context, &amp;quot;geometrical descriptions&amp;quot; (say a point, line, surface, volume, lamina, etc.) are mapped onto the subject and object of the preposition. Strictly speaking, the core meanings are -at best -true only of these geometric In fact, they not hold for any geometric description -see the a bond example above, assuming the natural core meaning for &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;, i.e. &amp;quot;inclusion&amp;quot;. Yet, the core meaning is then present as &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot;. Here are informal definitions of the core meanings for two categories of prepositions, designated as in), &amp;quot;projective&amp;quot; the rig/it, .,book 3 Topological prepositions: in: partial inclusion of a geometrical construct in a volume, an area, or a line. an: contiguity, adjacency of a geometrical construct with a surface, or a line. coincidence of point with a point in space. In actual context, inclusion, contiguity, and coincidence need not be true. Thus the book on top of a of books on the table can be said on the at the gate very close to it. But the relations represent the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; around which particular instances gravitate. Thus at implies the closest reasonable relationship between two objects, and coincidence where center of the of Intersection of the axes). course, the core meanings are not sufficient to determine the conditions of use of a given preposition: one must also know precisely which deviations from the ideal are permitted. One principal process mediating core meanings and actual use is the mapping of objects onto points, surfaces, and volumes. I am not saying that the core meanings presented here are the only possible ones. Only when core meanings are incorporated in a global explanatory system will it be possible to make rigorous arguments for alternate choices. Those proposed here represent a good starting point. Projective prepositions: Each of these prepositions involves -through fact, supposition, or metaphor -a &amp;quot;point of observation&amp;quot;. A point of observation consists of two vectors, one the intrinsic vertical of the observer will not be the gravitational vertical if the observer is lying down, or not in the gravitational field), and the other orthogonal to the first along the line of sight. These two vectors completely specify four coplanar orthogonal half-line axes associated with the point of observation: the &amp;quot;front&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;back&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; axes, in clockwise order. In the core meaning definition of these prepositions, reference and located objects are points. Given a point one can specify axes associated the reference object -the &amp;quot;base axes&amp;quot; (right, left, and back) which to nght, behind, will be defined. These axes originate object. If the point of observation with the reference object (PRef) (figure A below), the base axes are identical to those of the point of observation. If the point of observation is away from the reference object (figure B), the base axes are a mirror image of those of the point of observation -the mirror plane being the bisector of the segment joining point of observation to reference object. front/ ■0f--0 A There are thus two possible orders of the base axes, as in B. I will define the core meaning of each projective preposition as follows: given a punctual reference punctual located object and a point of observation, base axes can be constructed to the procedure outlined above: is to iff it is located on the left base axis. Analogous definitions for the other prepositions are easy to formulate. A few examples will help understand how these cdre are manifest in uses of the prepositions. of a rolling acme, point of observation is &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot;-i.e. it is an hypothetical location and direction for viewing: the location is coincident with stone,, and the direction is the movement. One must of course assume -as with the objects in the examples that follow -that the stone is asimilated to a point. the right of the chair, base axes may be specified as those intrinsic to the chair -i.e. by reference to a typical user. The point of observation is then coincident with the reference object -namely the chair. Coincidence may be the case when the base axes are not intrinsic to the reference object: for instance the net of the be defined with respect to somebody sitting on it, given a round stool with no Intrinsic front axis. Reference object and point of observation are separated cloud. can also be separated when the base axes are intrinsic to the reference object: an right side of the closet, point of observation is defined by a typical user facing the closet. Again, one might define the core meanings differently. .particular one could core meaning of &amp;quot;to the right&amp;quot; say, as implying location in the whole right-hand half-space instead of on the axis. The choice adopted here reflects the fact noted in earlier that the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; realization of the with the located object on the right base axis. Processes other than the mapping of objects onto points may mediate between core meanings and actual conditions use. The reference object aay rotate: where is the nMM of the painting the painting is tilted? nee the right of the means &amp;quot;at some point of the -think of a curving road), and city behind the wire fence &amp;quot;Integration&amp;quot; along the length of fence (note one cannot say city to the right of Me fence to the same effect -that is referring in this way to the whole city. The line of sight is a favored axis, as compared to right, left, and back axes). CONCLUS1C&apos;S Here are the main problems and directions of inquiry by the examples in paper. One cannot fully explain the use of a locative predication in a given situation in terms of the core together with some general principles involving object knowledge, salience, the precision desired, etc. There remain involving some of are &amp;quot;motivated&amp;quot;, if not -morphemes the appropriate are normally from &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; candidates). Even Such principles are at play, they may operate not at the comprehension/production level, but rather at the 4 left (right front fr nt// left*. -Mright bOck v B 4 phylogenetic level. To sort principled aspects of use from arbitrary ones, and to understand exactly where such principles operate, one must of course first establish their existence and nature. In terms of knowledge of the physical world, I believe one important step toward adequate representations is to put the experiencer back into the picture. That is, it is not enough -or even always necessary -to know where what objects are; one must also consider how much fits into one field of view, how things &amp;quot;appear&amp;quot; as opposed to how they &amp;quot;are&amp;quot;, how this changes with viewing distance, visibility, obstruction, etc. General principles of salience should Lie studied: how some object parts or relations are selected as most important -either in all imaginable contexts, or in some contexts. Salience underlies many instances of (in front theatre, actually refers to the part occupied by the audience). Many questions revolve around the issue of &amp;quot;relevance&amp;quot; -of &amp;quot;what matters, to whom, in what circumstances&amp;quot; rather than the traditional concern with what is true. All existing artificial intelligence programs have Ignored this problem by using a limited vocabulary in a limited domain, so that the question of selecting relevant utterances never arises. Relevance is linked to the speaker&apos;s purpose, as many of the contextual factors described in this paper -indeterminacy, Gricean inferences, highlighting of background elements, determination of the Figure/Ground relationship, etc. The set of &amp;quot;expressible&amp;quot; goals is constrained by the &amp;quot;potential&amp;quot; of the language, i.e. by a semantic system with finitely many options. One can only want to say what can be said, and said in a reasonable amount of time. Clearly, &amp;quot;planning&amp;quot; for natural language processing Is a very important problem. Purpose however, will not explain everything one says. Simple associative mechanisms must sometimes be responsible for what one says. For instance, some background element may be highlighted -provided some linguistic means to do so exists -only because some passive associative link has brought it to attention. Once general principles are better understood, it is an open question whether they are used by speakers, or whether their explanatory power is at the phylogenetic level (and will thus be only implicit in the structure of the knowledge representation). For instance, although there is a general principle that the located object should be more mobile than the reference object, production may not proceed by inferences from this general principle together with scenarios involving the two objects. The linguistic expression (or pattern for expressions) may be attached to some representation of a &amp;quot;situation type&amp;quot; ,involving the two objects (or two superordinate objects). And although &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; generally implies the closest reasonable relationship between two objects, such a definition may never be used by a speaker -or used only in the creation or understanding of novel types of expressions, metaphors, witticisms, etc. What speakers do, and what computer models of comprehension and production processes should be made to do, are two different things: the latter depends on the constructer&apos;s goals, which should be subjected to some scrutiny. A computational treatment of the use of prepositions will require much greater sophistication than naive representation theory would lead us to expect.</abstract>

That patch of grass could be referred to alternately as a front-yard, a lawn, emu, a patch of grass, etc. (to assume that these phrases refer to the same object, one must see the grass as a metonymic substitute for this !souk of grass, and the frantlard as some &amp;quot;area&amp;quot; rather than a &amp;quot;slice&amp;quot; including, air above and ground under; neither view is unreasonable). The permissible prepositions, and their interpretation, vary with each referring phrase: compare in/on the grass, in/on the patch offsets, in/(son) rlie frontlard, on/(&apos;&apos;In) the lawn (Fillmore 1971). With this warning, I will go on speaking of &amp;quot;object characteristics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;object identity&amp;quot;, etc. Some of the object characteristics used in production and interpretation can be computed from the shape of the objects -- the axes of symmetry (needed for am/ the road and along the road), the &amp;quot;top surface&amp;quot; (on the (able), the &amp;quot;outline&amp;quot; (the bird in the tree), etc. (for a description of some of these characteristics, and of their role in comprehension, see (Boggess 19791). Other characteristics are not deducible from shape. These include: 1.1, ALTERNATE GEOMETRIC DESCRIPTIONS Objects identical in sh</context>

Thus, if I said put the chair to the rig/it of the desk, I would expect you to put it more or less on the right axis of the desk. And, in the figure below, A is to the right of B only in the absence of C. The location of A must be contrasted with that of similar objects in the relevant part of space. A (One could however say here: A is to the right and behind B, or A is diagonally to the rig/it of B. This suggests that even in the presence of C, A is to the right of B is true, but &amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; (Grice 1974). However, it is &amp;quot;uncooperative&amp;quot; precisely because of some intrinsic property of the concept to the rig/it -- i.e. because &amp;quot;closer to the axis&amp;quot; is in some sense a better way to realize to the right. Even if one grants some usefulness to the semantic/pragmatic distinction, it does not neatly apply here.) A similar use of contrast can be seen with the chair is in (At corner in the figure below. It is not appropriate unless the armchair be removed. The concept of a &amp;quot;corner&amp;quot; has built in that in the corner becomes less appropriate as one gets further from the vertex itself. 2.9. OTHERS Many uses o</context>

Most often, this is not a matter of actual distance, but a way of viewing an object for a given purpose: one may choose to ignore one or more dimensions, or internal characteristics of the object. For example, a road may be seen as a strip (a truth on the road), or a line (a village on the mud to Londen). Normally behind the &amp;nue will be based on the house&apos;s own axes. But when looking from some distance, one may use one&apos;s line of sight as axis. Another aspect of viewpoint, is the bounded/unbounded distinction. Compare walking through versus across 04 water (Talmy 1978b1: in the former the boundaries of the body of water are ignored, but in the latter, the extension of the body of water from one end to another is involved. 2.4.

If function is the relevant aspect, it is of no interest to distinguish between situations where bulb and socket are as above, and their upside down versions. With the bowl, this distinction matters.
