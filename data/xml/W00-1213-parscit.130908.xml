This paper reported our work on
annotating Chinese texts with
information structures derived from
HowNet. An information structure
consists of two components: HowNet
definitions and dependency relations. It
is the unit of representation of the
meaning of texts. This work is part of a
multi-sentential approach to Chinese
text understanding. An overview of
HowNet and information structure are
described in this paper.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999449375">
Corpora are essential resources to any research
in language engineering. For Chinese, efforts in
building large corpora started in the 90s. For
instance, the PH corpus of 4 million Chinese
characters with word boundary information was
released in 1993 (Guo, 1993). The first version
of the Sinica corpus of two millions words
marked with word boundaries and parts-of-
speech was released in 1995 (CKIP, 1995). In
1996, a small corpus of 5266 distinct words
(inclusive of punctuation marks) with a total
occurrence frequency of 51870 was released (Yu
et al., 1996). This corpus was derived from the
Singapore Primary School Chinese Language
Textbooks. It contained information on word
boundaries, parts-of-speech and also syntactic
structures. In 2000, two additional bracketed
corpora have just been announced. The first one,
the Chinese Penn Treebank, includes 100-
thousand words (Xia et al., 2000). The second
one, the Sinica Treebank, which is derived from
the Sinica corpus, contains 38,725 sentences
with 1000 of them released to the publicl (CKIP,
2000).
The historical development of Chinese corpus
construction has shown a consensus in
incorporating more powerful linguistic
structures into corpora. As noted by Marcus
(1997), the more powerful linguistic structures
will help in improving the accuracy of parsing.
This is especially true to isolating language such
as Chinese. However, there is very little work on
annotating corpora with semantic information.
To the best of our knowledge, there is only one
report of this kind. The work by Lua2 annotated
340,000 words with semantic class information
as defined in a thesaurus of synonyms (Mei,
1983). With the release of HowNet3, a bilingual
general knowledge base, Gan and Thain (1999)
reported the first corpus of 30,000 words that
was annotated with the general knowledge
structure defined in HowNet. This paper
reported an extension of the work in Gan and
Tham (1999) on the annotation of information
structures in Chinese texts. In Section 2, an
overview of HowNet is provided. Information
structure and an illustration will be given in
Section 3.

2 An Overview of HowNet

HowNet is a bilingual general knowledge-base
describing relations between concepts and
relations between the attributes of concepts. The
latest version covers over 65,000 concepts in

Chinese and close to 75,000 English equivalents.
The relations include hyponymy, synonymy,
antonymy, meronymy, attribute-host, material-
product, converse, dynamic role and concept
cooccurrence. The philosophy behind the design
of HowNet is its ontological view that all
physical and non-physical matters undergo a
continual process of motion and change in a
specific space and time. The motion and change
are usually reflected by a change in state that in
turn, is manifested by a change in value of some
attributes. The top-most level of classification in
HowNet thus includes: entity, event, attribute
and attribute value. It is important to point out
that the classification is derived in a bottom-up
manner. First, a set of sememes, the most basic
set of semantic units that are non-decomposable,
is extracted from about 6,000 Chinese characters.
This is feasible because each Chinese character
is monosyllabic and they are meaning-bearing.
Similar sememes are grouped. The coverage of
the set of sememes is tested against polysyllabic
concepts to identify additional sememes.
Eventually, a total of over 1,400 sememes are
found and they are organized hierarchically.
This is a closed set from which all concepts are
defined. The bottom-up approach takes
advantage of the fact that all concepts, either
current or new, can be expressed using a
combination of one or more existing Chinese
characters. It is yet to find a new concept that
has to resort to the creation of a new Chinese
character. Therefore, by deriving the set of
sememes in a bottom-up fashion, it is believed
that the set of sememes is stable and robust
enough to describe all kinds of concepts,
whether current or new. The fact that HowNet
has verified this thesis over 65,000 concepts is a
good proof of its robustness.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999678">
2.1 Types of Relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
The definition of a concept in HowNet expresses
one or more of the following relations.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.904609">
2.1.1 Dynamic Role
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977110696969697">
There are a total of 71 dynamic roles defined in
HowNet. Dynamic role resembles case role in
case grammar (Fillmore, 1968). However, it
differs from case role in that it is concerned with
all probable actants of an event and the roles
they play in the event. The issue of whether
these actants can be realized grammatically is
not its concern. For example,
Concept(1): OM (be a vegetarian for
religious reasons)
DEFatIRL, patient=vegetableIM,
rehgionIr
At the syntactic level, &amp;quot;OM&amp;quot; is an intransitive
verb. According to case grammar, it has only
one case role: agent. However, for this word, the
patient is self-contained in its constituent (i.e.
&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; ). HowNet specifies this explicitly and
indicates the category (&apos;vegetable&apos;4) of
prototypical concepts which fills up this role.
Another distinguishing feature of dynamic role
is its use in defining concepts of &apos;entity&apos; class.
Concept(2): (writing brush)
DEF=PenInklM, *writeln
Through the use of the &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; pointer, the above
definition states that the concept being defined
() is the instrument of the event type a
&apos;write&apos;.
HowNet also uses dynamic role to specify the
attributes that a concept contains. For example,
Concept(3): ZtriA3K (arise suddenly)
DEF=happen141., manner=suddenln
The definition of concept (3) specifies that the
manner of the event is &apos;sudden&apos;.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.98502">
2.1.2 Hyponymy Relation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999608">
The &apos;event&apos; and &apos;entity&apos; classes in HowNet are
organized in a hierarchical manner. The parent
class is a hypernym of its children classes.
Details of the organization are available from the
HowNet site and are therefore omitted here.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.977702">
2.1.3 Meronymy Relation

pointer &amp;quot;%&amp;quot; . For example,
Concept (4): 112151aiNgg (CPU)
DEF=partaf, %computerl&apos;argi, heartbb
The class of the-concept &amp;quot;11=1311W&amp;quot; is
&apos;part&apos;. It is a part of the class &apos;computer&apos;. The
function of the part &amp;quot;14:t9Utila&amp;quot; is the
&apos;heart&apos; of the whole &apos;computer&apos;.

2.1.4 Material-Product Relation

<bodyText confidence="0.991299">
Material-product relation is expressed through
the pointer &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; . For example,
Concept (5): (knitting wool)

&amp;quot;la&amp;quot; belongs to the class &apos;material&apos;. It is a
material for the product &apos;clothing&apos;.

3 Information Structures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999755882352941">
Dong (2000) uses the example
&amp;quot; (Narcotic drugs smuggling group) to
illustrate what information structure is.
Describing the structure of this phrase at the
syntactic level, such as the analysis of Penn
Treebank (Xue, 1999: 72-77), only reveals that it
is a noun phrase with the head of &amp;quot;XlE&amp;quot;
modified by a relative clause
which involves operator movement. At the
semantic level of description, we would indicate
that &amp;quot;Xffi&amp;quot; (group) is the agent of the event
&amp;quot;f./.,&amp;quot; (smuggle) and “eg,&amp;quot; (Narcotic
drugs) is the patient of &amp;quot;tb,&amp;quot; (smuggle).
The informaton structure of this example
consists of two parts, the dependency relations
and the HowNet definitions. The descriptions
are as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.989890333333333">
2.1.5 Attribute-Host Relation Dependency *Pa [patient]-4—fi,4—[agent]XlE
Attribute-host relation is expressed by the relations: medicinelfitt ?addictive*
pointer &amp;quot;&amp;&amp;quot; . For example, Definitions: transportIM, manner=
Concept (6): (face) secretlfZ, crimelgR
DEF=attributeljatt, reputationt4W, conununity I INIE

&amp;quot;ffi-7-&amp;quot; is an attribute; in particular, it is about
the attribute &apos;reputation&apos;. The hosts could be
&apos;human&apos; as well as &apos;organization&apos;.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994809">
2.1.6 Concept Co-occurrence Relation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9791874">
Some concept typically co-occurs with certain
concept. For example,
Concept (7): TaZ.fit (lawless person)
DEF=humanIA, fierce*, crimeln,
#policee, undesiredIN
The typical context where the concept &amp;quot;NA
Z-Ijt&amp;quot; is used involves the concept &apos;police&apos;.
This type of relation is expressed by the pointer
44#&gt;&gt;
In this example, the descriptions specify that a
&apos;community&apos; is an agent involved in a
&apos;transport&apos; event transporting the patient
&apos;medicine&apos;. Furthermore, the &apos;transport&apos; event is
a &apos;crime&apos; and the manner is &apos;secret&apos;. The
&apos;medicine&apos; is a material of &apos;addictive&apos; products.
The arrow between two concepts is a
dependency connection with the concept pointed
to by the arrow denoting the dependent and the
concept at the other end as the governor. The
name of the dependency relation is enclosed in a
square bracket and it could appear at either the
dependent or the governor side.
Currently, over 60 types of information structure
have been defined. The pattern of information
structure is specified in the following format
(sememe) [DRel] ---&gt; [DRel] (sememe), where
DRel means the name of a dependency relation.
For the dependency relation to apply, the
governor and the dependent must satisfy the
requirement of the sememes. Table 1 shows a

subset of the information structures. Information
structures are derived in a bottom-up fashion
from analysing the mechanisms used in the
composition of words. This approach is based on
the insight that mechanisms used in word
formation are also applicable to phrase and
sentence construction in Chinese. For example,
the type &amp;quot;(11411311thne) [IVEUltime] 4— (*4
!event)&amp;quot; applies to the formation of the
following units at various levels of linguistic
structure:
level:
</bodyText>

word &amp;quot;4--Iffi&amp;quot; (afternoon nap)
phrase &amp;quot;Ong4-4T&amp;quot; (summer study)

level: shortage of commodities)
&amp;quot;1999*12 n 96 RIME14---gta
&amp;quot; (leaking occurs on Thursday,
December 9, 1999)
In the process of annotating the corpus, the
coverage of information structure types at the
phrase and sentence levels was evaluated and
missing types are added. The new types arise
mainly due to function words. For example, the
type &amp;quot; (modality! ) [modalityl A-] 4—
(41event)&amp;quot; is due to the use of function
words such as &amp;quot;Nto&amp;quot; (must) and &amp;quot;ffra-
(must). These are words expressing the attitude
of the speaker of an utterance towards an event.

<bodyText confidence="0.998810153846154">
We annotated a subset of the Sinica corpus
(version 3.0) of 30,000 words with information
structures. The corpus includes 103 newspaper
texts covering the crime domain. The annotation
has been completed and is currently under
verification. We expect to release the corpus and
the annotation guideline at the end of this year.
An example of our annotation is shown below
and its information structures are shown in
Figure 1 at the end of this paper. The difference
between this work and the work reported in Gan
and Tham (1999) lies in the addition of the
dependency relations into the annotation.

The hierarchical structure in Figure 1 is another
way to represent the relation between governor
and dependent, as illustrated in Figure 2. Cl
immediately dominates C2, indicating that Cl is
the governor and C2 the dependent. The relation
between them is either R1 or R2. R1 is located
at the same level as Cl and R2 is located at the
same level as C2. These two possibilities could
also be represented linearly as shown in (2).

R2 between the two concepts Cl and C2 should

HowNet can contribute much to better text

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983264">
The work reported here constitutes part of our
efforts to develop a new strategy for Chinese
text understanding. The strategy was proposed
by Dong (1999). It starts with tagging each
concept with the most probable HowNet
definitions. The second step is to determine the
information structures as described in this paper.
The last step is to recover the implicit
information structures from the surface
information structures based on two additional
knowledge sources: (i) relations between the
event types as defined in HowNet; and (ii) rules
governing the interplay of dynamic roles
between event types. For example, the `suicide&apos;
event in example (1) does not mention its agent
directly. The means of committing `suicide&apos; by
`firing&apos; is also implicit. The recovery of this
information will be the main issues to be
resolved at the final stage. In parallel with our
annotation effort, we are also working on
developing automatic algorithms for the
disambiguation of HowNet definitions and the
identification of information structures. The
creation of the two additional knowledge bases
will be our future plan.

As an English and Chinese bilingual common-sense knowledge system, HowNet can contribute much to better text understanding and machine translation (Dong 1999). 4 Conclusion The work reported here constitutes part of our efforts to develop a new strategy for Chinese text understanding. The strategy was proposed by Dong (1999). It starts with tagging each concept with the most probable HowNet definitions. The second step is to determine the information structures as described in this paper. The last step is to recover the implicit information structures from the surface information structures based on two additional knowledge sources: (i) relations between the event types as defined in HowNet; and (ii) rules governing the interplay of dynamic roles b</context>

Therefore, by deriving the set of sememes in a bottom-up fashion, it is believed that the set of sememes is stable and robust enough to describe all kinds of concepts, whether current or new. The fact that HowNet has verified this thesis over 65,000 concepts is a good proof of its robustness. 2.1 Types of Relation The definition of a concept in HowNet expresses one or more of the following relations. 2.1.1 Dynamic Role There are a total of 71 dynamic roles defined in HowNet. Dynamic role resembles case role in case grammar (Fillmore, 1968). However, it differs from case role in that it is concerned with all probable actants of an event and the roles they play in the event. The issue of whether these actants can be realized grammatically is not its concern. For example, Concept(1): OM (be a vegetarian for religious reasons) DEFatIRL, patient=vegetableIM, rehgionIr At the syntactic level, &amp;quot;OM&amp;quot; is an intransitive verb. According to case grammar, it has only one case role: agent. However, for this word, the patient is self-contained in its constituent (i.e. &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; ). HowNet specifies this explicitly and indicates the category (&apos;vegeta</context>

We expect to release the corpus and the annotation guideline at the end of this year. An example of our annotation is shown below and its information structures are shown in Figure 1 at the end of this paper. The difference between this work and the work reported in Gan and Tham (1999) lies in the addition of the dependency relations into the annotation.

An information structure consists of two components: HowNet definitions and dependency relations. It is the unit of representation of the meaning of texts. This work is part of a multi-sentential approach to Chinese text understanding. An overview of HowNet and information structure are described in this paper. 1 Introduction Corpora are essential resources to any research in language engineering. For Chinese, efforts in building large corpora started in the 90s. For instance, the PH corpus of 4 million Chinese characters with word boundary information was released in 1993 (Guo, 1993). The first version of the Sinica corpus of two millions words marked with word boundaries and parts-ofspeech was released in 1995 (CKIP, 1995). In 1996, a small corpus of 5266 distinct words (inclusive of punctuation marks) with a total occurrence frequency of 51870 was released (Yu et al., 1996). This corpus was derived from the Singapore Primary School Chinese Language Textbooks. It contained information on word boundaries, parts-of-speech and also syntactic structures. In 2000, two additional bracketed corpora have just been announced. The first one, the Chinese Penn Treebank, includes 100</context>
