ABSTRACT
This paper pinpoints some of the problems
faced when a computer text production model
(COMMENTATOR) is to produce spontaneous speech, in
particular the problem of chunking the utterances
in order to get natural prosodic units. The paper
proposes a buffer model which allows the accumula-
tion and delay of phonetic material until a chunk
of the desired size has been built up. Several
phonetic studies have suggested a similar tempo-
rary storage in order to explain intonation slopes,
rythmical patterns, speech errors and speech dis-
orders. Small-scale simulations of the whole ver-
balization process from perception and thought to
sounds, hesitation behaviour, pausing, speech
errors, sound changes and speech disorders are pre-
sented.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9946058125">
Several text production models implement-
ed on computers are able to print grammatical sen-
tences and coherent text (see e.g. contributions in
Allen, 1983, Mann &amp; Matthiessen, 1982). There is,
however, to my knowledge no such verbal production
system with spoken output, simulating spontaneous
speech, except the experimental version of
Commentator to be described.
The task to design a speech production
system cannot be solved just by attaching a speech
synthesis device to the output instead of a printer.
The whole production model has to be reconsidered
if the system is to produce natural sound and pro-
sody, in particular if the system is to have some
psychological reality by simulating the hesitation
pauses, and speech errors so common in spontaneous
speech.
This paper discusses some of the prob-
lems in the light of the computer model of verbal
production presented in Sigurd (1982), Fornell
(1983). For experimental purposes a simple speech
synthesis device (VOTRAX) has been used.
The Problem of producing naturally
sounding utterances is also met in text-to-speech
systems (see e.g. Carlson &amp; Granstrtim, 1978). Such
systems, however, take printed text as input and
turn it into a phonetic representation, eventually
sound. Because of the differences between spelling
and sound such systems have to face special prob-
lems, e.g. to derive single sounds from the letter
combinations th, El, sh, ch in such words as the,
thing, shy, change.
2. Commentator as a speech production
system
The general outline of Commentator is
presented in fig. 1. The input to this model is
perceptual data or equivalent values, e.g. infor-
mation about persons and objects on a screen. These
primary perceptual facts constitute the basis for
various calculations in order to derive secondary
facts and draw conclusions about movements and re-
lations such as distances, directions, right/left,
over/under, front/back, closeness, goals and in-
tentions of the persons involved etc. The
Commentator produces comments consisting of gram-
matical sentences making up coherent and well-
formed text (although often soon boring). Some
typical comments on a marine scene are: THE SUB-

MARINE IS TO THE SOUTH OF THE PORT. IT IS APPROACH-
ING THE PORT, BUT IT IS NOT CLOSE TO IT. THE
DESTROYER IS APPROACHING THE PORT TOO. The orig-
inal version commented on the movements of the
two persons ADAM and EVE in front of a gate.
A question menu, different for different
situations, suggests topics leading to proposi-
tions which are considered appropriate under the
circumstances and their truth values are tested
against the primary and secondary facts of the
world known to the system (the simulated scene).
If a proposition is found to be true, it is ac-
cepted as a protosentence and verbalized by var-
ious lexical, syntactic, referential and texual
subroutines. If, e.g., the proposition CLOSE
(SUBMARINE, PORT) is verified after measuring the
distance between the submarine and the port, the
lexical subroutines try to find out how closeness,
the submarine and the port should be expressed in
the language (Swedish and English printing and
speaking versions have been implemented).
The referential subroutines determine
whether pronouns could be used instead of proper
or other nouns and textual procedures investigate
whether connectives such as but, however, too,
either and perhaps contrastive stress should be
inserted.
Dialogue (interactive) versions of the
Commentator have also been developed, but it is
difficult to simulate dialogue behaviour. A
person taking part in a dialogue must also master
turntaking, questioning, answering, and back-
channelling (indicating, listening, evaluation).
Expert systems, and even operative systems, simu-
-late dialogue behaviour, but as everyone knows,
who has worked with computers, the computer dia-
logue often breaks down and it is poor and cer-
tainly not as smooth as human dialogue.
The Commentator can deliver words one
at a time whose meaning, syntactic and textual
functions are well-defined through the verbal-
ization processes. For the printing version of
Commentator these words are characterized by
whatever markers are needed.

<bodyText confidence="0.9989139375">
The experimental system presented in this
paper uses a Votrax speech synthesis unit (for a
presentation see Giarcia, 1982). Although it is
a very simple system designed to enable computers
to deliver spoken output such as numbers, short
instructions etc, it has some experimental poten-
tials. It forces the researcher to take a stand on
a number of interesting issues and make theories
about speech production more concrete. The Votrax
is an inexpensive and unsophisticated synthesis
device and it is not our hope to achieve perfect
pronunciation using this circuit, of course. The
circuit, rather, provides a simple way of doing
research in the field of speech production.

cuit named SC-01 sold under several trade names)

offers a choice of some 60 (American) English
sounds (allophones) and 4 pitch levels. A sound
must be transcribed by its numerical code and a
pitch level, represented by one of the figures
0,1,2,3. The pitch figures correspond roughly to
the male levels 65,90,110,130 Hz. Votrax offers
no way of changing the amplitude or the duration.
Votrax is designed for (American) English
and if used for other languages it will, of course,
add an English flavour. It can, however, be used
at least to produce intelligible words for several
other languages. Of course, some sounds may be
lacking, e.g. Swedish u and v and some sounds may
be slightly different, as e.g. Swedish sh-, ch-,
r-, and 1-sounds.
Most Swedish words can be pronounced
intelligibly by the Votrax. The pitch levels have
been found to be sufficient for the production of
the Swedish word tones: accent 1 (acute) as in
and-en (the duck) and accent 2 (grave) as in ande-
n (the spirit). Accent 1 can be rendered by the
pitch sequence 20 and accent 2 by the sequence 22
on the stressed syllable (the beginning) of the
words. Stressed syllables have to include at least
one 2.
Words are transcribed in the Votrax al-
phabet by series of numbers for the sounds and
their pitch levels. The Swedish word hoger (right)
may be given by the series 27,2,58,0,28,0,35,0,
43,0, where 27,58,28,35,43 are the sounds corre-
sponding to h,8:,g,e,r, respectively and the fig-
ures 2,0 etc after each sound are the pitch levels
of each sound. The word hoger sounds American
because of the 6, which sounds like the (retroflex)
vowels in bird.
The pronunciation (execution) of the
words is handled by instructions in a computer
program, which transmits the information to the
sound generators and the filters simulating the
human vocal apparatus.
4. Some problems to handle
4.1. Pauses and prosodic units in speech
The spoken text produced by human beings is
normally divided by pauses into units of several
words (prosodic units). There is no generally
accepted theory explaining the location and dura-
tion of the pauses and the intonation and stress
patterns in the prosodic units. Many observations
have, however, been made, see e.g. Dechert &amp;
Raupach (1980).
The printing version of Commentator col-
lects all letters and spaces into a string before
they are printed. A speaking version trying to
simulate at least some of the production processes
cannot, of course, produce words one at a time
with pauses corresponding to the word spaces, nor
produce all the words of a &apos;sentence as one proso-
dic unit. A speaking version must be able to pro-
duce prosodic units including 3-5 words (cf
Svartvik (1982)) and lasting 1-2 seconds (see
Jonsson, Mandersson &amp; Sigurd (1983)). How this
should be achieved may be called the chunking
problem. It has been noted that the chunks of
spontaneous speech are generally shorter than in
text read aloud.
The text chunks have internal intonation
and stress patterns often described as superim-
posed on the words. Deriving these internal proso-
dic patterns may be called the intra-chunk problem.
We may also talk about the inter-chunk problem
having to do with the relations e.g. in pitch,
between succesive chunks.
As human beings need to breathe they
have to pause in order to inhale at certain inter-
vals. The need for air is generally satisfied
without conscious actions. We estimate that chunks
of 1-2 seconds and inhalation pauses of about 0.5
seconds allow convenient breathing. Clearly,
breathing allows great variation. Everybody has
met persons who try to extend the speech chunks
and minimize the pauses in order to say as much
as possible, or to hold the floor.
It has also been observed that pauses
often occur where there is a major syntactic break
(corresponding to a deep cut in the syntactic
tree), and that, except for so-called hesitation
pauses, pauses rarely occur between two words
which belong closely together (corresponding to a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996743">
81
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982629032258">
shallow cut in the syntactic tree). There is,
however, no support for a simple theory that
pauses are introduced between the main constitu-
ents of the sentence and that their duration is a
function of the depthof the cuts in the syntactic
tree. The conclusion to draw seems rather to be
that chunk cuts are avoided between words which
belong closely together. Syntactic structure does
not govern chunking, but puts constraints on it.
Click experiments which show that the click is
erroneously located at major syntactic cuts rather
than between words which are syntactically coherent
seem to point in the same direction. As an illus-
tration of syntactic closeness we mention the
combination of a verb and a following reflexive
pronoun as in Adam n4rmar+sig Eva. (&amp;quot;Adam ap-
proaches Eva&amp;quot;). Cutting between narmar and sig
would be most unnatural.
Lexical search, syntactic and textual
planning are often mentioned as the reasons for
pauses, so-called hesitation pauses, filled or
unfilled. In the speech production model envisaged
in this paper sounds are generally stored in a
buffer where they are given the proper intona-
tional contours and stress patterns. The pronun-
ciation is therefore generally delayed. Hesitation
pauses seem, however, to be direct (on-line) re-
flexes of searching or planning processes and at
such moments there is no delay. Whatever has been
accumulated in the articulation or execution
buffer is pronounced and the system is waiting
for the next word. While waiting (idling), some
human beings are silent, others prolong the last
sounds of the previous word or produce sounds,
such as ah, eh, or repeat part of the previous
utterence. (This can also be simulated by
Commentator.) Hesitation pauses may occur anywhere,
but they seem to be more frequent before lexical
words than function words.
By using buffers chunking may be made
according to various principles. If a sentence
termination (full stop) is entered in the execu-
tion buffer, whatever has been accumulated in the
buffer may be pronounced setting the pitch of the
final part at low. If the number of segments in
the chunk being accumulated in the buffer does
not exceed a certain limit a new word is only
stored after the others in the execution buffer.
The duration of a sound in Votrax is 0.1 second
on the average. If the limit is set at 15 the
system will deliver chunks about 1.5 seconds,
which is a common length of speech chunks. The
system may also accumulate words in such a way
that each chunk normally includes at least one
stressed word, or one syntactic constituent (if
these features are marked in the representation).
The system may be made to avoid cutting where
there is a tight syntactic link, as e.g. between
a head word and enclitic morphemes. The length
of the chunk can be varied in order to simulate
different speech styles, individuals or speech
disorders.

4.2. Prosodic patterns within utterance chunks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978461538462">
A system producing spontaneous speech
must give the proper prosodic patterns to all the
chunks the text has been divided into. Except for
a few studies, e.g. Svartvik (1982) most prosodic
studies concern well-formed grammatical sentences
pronounced in isolation. While waiting for further
information and more sophisticated synthesis
devices it is interesting to do experiments to
find out how natural the result is.
Only pitch, not intensity, is available
in Votrax, but pitch may be used to signal stress
too. Unstressed words may be assigned pitch level
1 or 0, stressed words 2 or higher on at least
one segment. Words may be assumed to be inherently
stressed or unstressed. In the restricted Swedish
vocabulary of Commentator the following illustrate
lexically stressed words: Adam, vanster (left),
nara (close), ocksa (too). The following words
are lexically unstressed in the experiments: han
(he), den (it), i (in), och (and), men (but), är
(is). Inherently unstressed words may become
stressed, e.g. by contrast assigned during the
verbalization process.
The final sounds of prosodic units are
often prolonged, a fact which can be simulated
by doubling some chunk-final sounds, but the
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988061875">
Votrax is not sophisticated enough to handle these
phonetic subtleties. Nor can it take into account
the fact that the duration of sounds seem to vary
with the length of the speech chunk.
The rising pitch observed in chunks which
are not sentence final (signalling incompleteness)
can be implemented by raising the pitch of the
final sounds of such chunks. It has also been ob-
served that words (syllables) within a prosodic
unit seem to be placed on a slope of intonation
(grid). The decrement to the pitch of each sound
caused by such a slope can be calculated knowing
the place of the sound and the length of the
chunk. But so far, the resulting prosody, as is
the case of text-to-speech systems, cannot be said
to be natural.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.494336">
4.3. Speech errors and sound change
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929375">
Speech errors may be classed as lexical,
grammatical or phonetic. Some lexical errors can
be explained (and simulated) as mistakes in pick-
ing up a lexical item. Instead of picking up
hogei (right) the word vgnster (left), a semi-
antonym, stored on an adjacent address, is sent
to the buffer. Grammatical mistakes may be simu-
lated by mixing up the contents of memories stor-
ing the constituents during the process of verbal-
ization.
Phonetic errors can be explaned (and
simulated) if we assume buffers where the phonetic
material is stored and mistakes in handling these
buffers. The representation in Votrax is not,
however, sophisticated enough for this purpose as
sound features and syllable constituents often
must be specified. If a person says pager om
porten instead of hoger om porten (to the right
of the gate) he has picked up the initial conso-
nantal element of the following stressed syllable
too early.
Most explanations of speech errors assume
an unconscious or a conscious monitoring of the
contents of the buffers used during the speech
production process. This monitoring (which in some
ways can be simulated by computer) may result in
changes in order to adjust the contents of the
buffers, e.g. to a certain norm or a fashion.
Similar monitoring is seen in word processing
systems which apply automatic spelling correction.
But there are several places in Commentator where
sound changes may be simulated.

The whole production model has to be reconsidered if the system is to produce natural sound and prosody, in particular if the system is to have some psychological reality by simulating the hesitation pauses, and speech errors so common in spontaneous speech.

The whole production model has to be reconsidered if the system is to produce natural sound and prosody, in particular if the system is to have some psychological reality by simulating the hesitation pauses, and speech errors so common in spontaneous speech. This paper discusses some of the problems in the light of the computer model of verbal production presented in Sigurd (1982), Fornell (1983). For experimental purposes a simple speech synthesis device (VOTRAX) has been used. The Problem of producing naturally sounding utterances is also met in text-to-speech systems (see e.g. Carlson &amp; Granstrtim, 1978). Such systems, however, take printed text as input and turn it into a phonetic representation, eventually sound. Because of the differences between spelling and sound such systems have to face special problems, e.g. to derive single sounds from the letter combinations th, El, sh, ch in such words as the, thing, shy, change. 2.

Many observations have, however, been made, see e.g. Dechert &amp; Raupach (1980). The printing version of Commentator collects all letters and spaces into a string before they are printed. A speaking version trying to simulate at least some of the production processes cannot, of course, produce words one at a time with pauses corresponding to the word spaces, nor produce all the words of a &apos;sentence as one prosodic unit. A speaking version must be able to produce prosodic units including 3-5 words (cf Svartvik (1982)) and lasting 1-2 seconds (see Jonsson, Mandersson &amp; Sigurd (1983)). How this should be achieved may be called the chunking problem. It has been noted that the chunks of spontaneous speech are generally shorter than in text read aloud. The text chunks have internal intonation and stress patterns often described as superimposed on the words. Deriving these internal prosodic patterns may be called the intra-chunk problem. We may also talk about the inter-chunk problem having to do with the relations e.g. in pitch, between succesive chunks. As human beings need to breathe they have to pause in order to inhale at certain intervals. The need for air is generally </context>

The system may be made to avoid cutting where there is a tight syntactic link, as e.g. between a head word and enclitic morphemes. The length of the chunk can be varied in order to simulate different speech styles, individuals or speech disorders. 4.2. Prosodic patterns within utterance chunks A system producing spontaneous speech must give the proper prosodic patterns to all the chunks the text has been divided into. Except for a few studies, e.g. Svartvik (1982) most prosodic studies concern well-formed grammatical sentences pronounced in isolation. While waiting for further information and more sophisticated synthesis devices it is interesting to do experiments to find out how natural the result is. Only pitch, not intensity, is available in Votrax, but pitch may be used to signal stress too. Unstressed words may be assigned pitch level 1 or 0, stressed words 2 or higher on at least one segment. Words may be assumed to be inherently stressed or unstressed. In the restricted Swedish vocabulary of Commentator the following illustrate lexically stresse</context>
