While large-scale corpora and various
corpus query tools have long been recog-
nized as essential language resources, the
value of word association norms as lan-
guage resources has been largely over-
looked. This paper conducts some initial
comparisons of the lexical relationships
observed within Japanese collocation da-
ta extracted from a large corpus using the
Japanese language version of the Sketch
Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanović et al.,
2008) and the relationships found within
Japanese word association sets taken
from the large-scale Japanese Word As-
sociation Database (JWAD) under ongo-
ing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007).
The comparison results indicate that
while some relationships are common to
both linguistic resources, many lexical
relationships are only observed in one re-
source. These findings suggest that both
resources are necessary in order to more
adequately cover the diverse range of
lexical relationships. Finally, the paper
reflects briefly on the implementation of
association-based word-search strategies
into electronic dictionaries proposed by
Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006).

corpora and corpus query tools has been particu-
larly significant in the area of compiling and de-
veloping lexicographic materials (Kilgarriff and
Rundell, 2002) and in the area of creating various
kinds of lexical resources, such as WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Atkins et al.,
2003; Fillmore et al., 2003).
In contrast, although the significance of data-
bases of free word association norms have long
been recognized within psychology in providing
insights into higher cognitive processes (Cramer,
1968; Deese, 1965; Nelson et al., 1998; Steyvers
and Tenenbaum, 2005), their value as a language
resource has been largely overlooked. However,
as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) point out,
databases of word association norms represent an
extremely useful supplement to the range of tra-
ditional language resources, such as large-scale
corpora, thesauri, and dictionaries, and can po-
tentially contribute greatly to the development of
more sophisticated linguistic resources.
This paper seeks to demonstrate the potential
value of word association databases as language
resources. Specifically, we conduct some initial
comparisons of the lexical relationships observed
within Japanese collocation data, as extracted
from a large corpus with the Japanese language
version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool
(Srdanović et al., 2008), with those found within
Japanese word association sets, which were
created through the ongoing construction of the
large-scale Japanese Word Association Database
(JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007). Interesting similar-
ities and differences between the two language
resources in terms of captured lexical relation-
ships affirm the value of word association data-
bases as rich linguistic resources. In concluding,
we speculate briefly on how the wider range of
lexical relationships identifiable through the
combination of collocation data and word associ-

ation databases could be utilized in organizing
lexical entries within electronic dictionaries in
ways that are cognitively salient. While we fully
acknowledge that the challenges involved are
formidable ones (Zock, 2006), the principled in-
corporation of word association knowledge with-
in electronic dictionaries could greatly facilitate
the development of more flexible and user-
friendly navigation and search strategies (Zock
and Bilac, 2004).

2.1 Sketch Engine (SkE): Word Sketches
and Thesaurus Tools
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841322580645">
Sketch Engine (SkE) (Kilgarriff et al. 2004) is a
web-based corpus query tool that supports a
number of functions. These include fast concor-
dancing, grammatical processing, ‘word sketch-
ing’ (one-page summaries of a word’s grammati-
cal and collocation behavior), a distributional
thesaurus, and robot use. SkE has been applied to
a number of languages. In this study, we utilize
the Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions for
the Japanese language. As both tools process raw
collocation data by organizing words according
to grammatical and lexical relationships, they are
particularly suited to the conducted comparisons
with the word association data.
Word Sketches (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001)
present the most frequent and statistically-salient
collocations and grammatical relations for a giv-
en word. These relations are derived as the re-
sults of grammatical analysis (a gramrel file) that
employs regular expressions over PoS-tags.
The distributional thesaurus groups together
words that occur in similar contexts and have
common collocation words. Estimations of se-
mantic similarity are based on ‘shared triples’.
For example, &lt;read a book&gt; and &lt;read a maga-
zine&gt; share the same triple pattern of &lt;read a ?&gt;,
and because ‘book’ and ‘magazine’ exhibit high
salience for the triple, they are both assumed to
belong to the same thesaurus category. This ap-
proach is similar to conventional techniques for
automatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998).

2.2 Word Association Norms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976363636364">
In contrast to the Word Sketch collocation and
thesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basic
input language resource, databases of word asso-
ciation norms are the results of psychological
experiments. The free word association task typi-
cally asks the respondent to respond with the first
semantically-related word that comes to mind on
presentation of a stimulus word.
The collection of word association normative
data can be traced back to the seminal study by
Kent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered word
association responses for a list of 100 stimulus
words. However, despite the insightful remarks
of Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that word
associations closely mirror the structured patterns
of relations that exist among concepts—claims
that undoubtedly warrant further investigation—
there are, unfortunately, still relatively few large-
scale databases of word association norms. The
notable exceptions for the English language in-
clude the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus
(EAT) (Kiss et al., 1973), which consists of ap-
proximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus list
of 8,400 words, and the University of South Flor-
ida Word Association, Rhyme, and Word Frag-
ment Norms compiled by Nelson et al. (1998),
consisting of nearly three-quarters of a million
responses to 5,019 stimulus words. Another da-
tabase deserving mention is the Russian Associa-
tion Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al.
(1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately
23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (cited
in Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004).

This section introduces the Japanese language
resources utilized in this study: namely, the Jap-
anese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi6

which is a 400-million word Japanese web cor-

POS-tagged with the ChaSen tool
(http://chasen.naist.jp/). The Word Sketches are
based on Japanese grammatical analysis results

3.2 Japanese Word Association Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990966666666">
To an even greater extent than for the English
language, there has been a serious lack of word
association norms for the Japanese language.
While Umemoto’s (1969) survey collected asso-
ciations from 1,000 university students, the li-
mited set of just 210 words merely underscores
the deficient. More recently, Okamoto and Ishi-
zaki (2001) compiled an Associative Concept
Dictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 word
association responses provided by 10 respon-
dents for 1,656 nouns. However, it should be
noted that the ACD is not strictly free association
data because response category was specified as
part of the task.
Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005,
2007), the Japanese Word Association Database
(JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a very
large-scale database of free word association
norms for the Japanese language in terms of both
the number of stimulus items and the numbers of
association responses collected. The present
JWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japa-
nese kanji and words. The currently available
JWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of
104,800 free word association responses col-
lected through a paper questionnaire survey with
a sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50
respondents. The association sets compared with
work sketch profiles in the subsequent sections
are from JWAD-V1.

4 Conducted Comparisons
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883352941176">
This section presents the results of our initial
comparison for the lexical relationships observed
within the Japanese collocation data with those in
the Japanese word association sets. The compari-
sons focused on approximately 350 word associ-
ation responses constituting the association sets
for the two verbs of kizuku (気付く to notice)
and sagasu (探す to search for), the adjective of
omoshiroi (面白い interesting), and the three
nouns of jitensha (自転車 bicycle), natsu (夏
summer), and yama (山 mountain), as examples
of basic Japanese vocabulary. Taking into ac-
count the considerable degree of orthographic
variation present with the Japanese writing sys-
tem, all possible orthographic variations were
searched for in the SkE, such as kizuku (気付く/
気づく) and omoshiroi (面白い/おもしろい).

4.1 Word Sketches and Thesaurus Versus
Word Association Norms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981580645162">
The Japanese SkE employs a large-scale Japa-
nese corpus and detailed grammatical analysis
based on ChaSen POS tags. Accordingly, nu-
merous lexical relationships are identified in the
word sketches and thesaurus results. For example,
kizuku appears 12,134 times in the corpus in ap-
proximately 200 collocation examples in total,
which are grouped under 12 different collocation
and grammatical relations and sorted according
to the statistical salience of the relation’s fre-
quency within the corpus (note that searches
were conducted with the default setting of only
including collocations with frequencies of five or
more). The thesaurus function also yields numer-
ous results, typically displaying around 60 salient
relations that are clustered into five semantic
groups. In contrast, while JWAD-V1 is quite
large-scale for a word association databases, it is
naturally far smaller than the Japanese SkE cor-
pus. As already noted, it consists of word associ-
ation collected from about 50 respondents (al-
though there are 100 respondents in the case of
kizuku), and where some responses would ob-
viously be provided by multiple respondents.
Comparisons of the SkE results with the sets
of word association responses revealed that there
is considerable overlap in the range of lexical
relationships observed in the two linguistics re-
sources. However, the comparisons also identi-
fied many lexical relationships that are only
present in one of the language resources.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994961">

<bodyText confidence="0.999461214285714">
Because of the large differences in the overall
sizes of the association responses in JWAD-V1
and the collocations in SkE, it is not surprising
that the word association data does not cover the
numerous collocation words present in the SkE
results. (In future studies, we plan to examine the
kinds of relationships that are extracted from the
corpora but which are not observed in the word
association database). However, it is very inter-
esting to note that a considerable number of the
JWAD word associations were not present in the
SkE results, even though the tool is drawing on a
much larger resource. In this study, we concen-
trate on describing these lexical relationships.

word association responses with frequencies of
two or more, as well as many with frequencies of
one, are not observed in the word sketches and
thesaurus results. While these results could be
indicating a need to consider new methods or
approaches to corpus-extraction in addition to
those currently employed, these findings also
strongly suggest that some of the lexical relation-
ships might be unique to the normative word as-
sociation data. Both resources unquestionably tap
into fundamental aspects of lexical relationships,
but the resources would seem to be quite differ-
ent in nature. Accordingly, the present results
suggest that investigations into lexical relation-
ships would do well to employ both corpus-based
results and databases of word association norms
in complementary ways, in order to provide more
comprehensive coverage of the diverse range of
lexical relationships.
The thesaurus function only outputs lexical re-
lationships between words of the same word
class. This function also yields synonym rela-
tionships that are also found in the word associa-
tion norms, and are rated as being highly salient
for the thesaurus results. For example, tanoshii
and kyomibukai (興味深い interesting) are word
association responses for omoshiroi.

This section discusses some of the lexical rela-

most frequent of these are presented in Table 2.
The first ‘coord’ group includes kawa (川 riv-

pleasant) with the adjective of omoshiroi, and
odoroku (驚く to be surprised) with the verb of
kizuku. Other frequent relationships are verbal
phrases involving appropriate particles (such as
nounNI (e.g., jitensha ni noru (自転車に乗る to
ride a bicycle), noPronom, nounWO (e.g., michi
wo sagasu (道を探す to look for a road), deVerb,

4.3 Relations Specific to Association Norms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883">
While acknowledging that it could be beneficial
to examine the types of lexical relationships ob-
served in the corpus-based results but not in the
word association data, given the relative differ-
ences in the sizes of the two resources, the
present study focuses on the relationships that
were only present in the database of word associ-
ation norms. Briefly, these relationships can be
classified under six categories.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8710656">
(1) Relationships involving a specific concept
related to the stimulus word and its contextual
meaning. In Table 3 below, many of these are
classified as ‘typically associated’ words. Exam-
ples include omoshiroi and warai (% •�3 %
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998754333333333">
L N•�D65 laughter), kizuku and chūi (ilft
attention), and natsu and taiyō (t% sun). These
relationships are neither collocational nor gram-
matical in nature, and so the grammatical analy-
sis currently employed in the word sketches can-
not identify them. On the other hand, while they
are semantically related, because they often be-
long to different word classes, the thesaurus
function also fails to identify them.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94414294117647">
(2) Relationships that are semantically similar
(could be regarded as close synonyms) but do not
belong to the same word class. Examples include
sagasu and tankyū (Q&amp; search) and kizuku and-
kikubari (,%R9 care, attention). While these
are not grammatical or collocational relations,
again, the thesaurus function is also unable to
find them because they belong to different word
classes.
(3) Association responses consisting of more
than one word. Examples include explanatory
phrases such as kibun ga ii (,%3`ffiL NL N lit.
‘feeling is good’, comfortable) as response to
omoshiroi, as well as concepts denoted by phras-
es, such as hito no kao (k0DM human faces),
also a response to omoshiroi.
(4) Relationships that could be recognized by the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975673583333334">
SkE, but which the present version fails to detect.
These would seem to reflect limitations with the
present ChaSen dictionary (e.g., it does not list
chari / charinko ( fi1• fi1;/--I casual
words for bicycle) or morphological/POS-
tagging errors with ChaSen, or relationships that
are not regarded as being sufficiently salient
within the complete corpus, because they may
appear frequently as both independent words and
as constituents of many poly-morpheme words
(e.g., omoshiroi hito (ff10L Nk interesting per-
son)).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.804867777777778">
(5) Relationships that can be identified when
search is executed for orthographic variants of
the word, such as tsumaranai (-D164�L N bor-
ing) being found when omoshiori is written in
hiragana (as �3tL75L N).
(6) Word association responses that are rather
idiosyncratic in nature, often reflecting private
experiences of a single respondent. The impor-
tance of such responses in word association data-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996619">
bases should be judged on the size of the data-
base, although one also should be cautious about
sampling issues with lower respondent numbers.
While it would certainly be interesting to con-
duct further comparisons between the association
norms and other kinds of corpora, such as literary
works, newspapers, or more balanced corpora,
processed by the SkE, the main purpose of the
present paper is to draw attention to the value of
word association databases as linguistic re-
sources. Although the lexical relationships in
categories 1 and 2 were not observed in the
present corpus-based results, they are unques-
tionably of great relevance to efforts to develop
more principled organizations of the lexicon for
navigational purposes, and would enhance exist-
ing lexical resources, such as WordNet. With
trends to increasingly include multiple word
idioms and phrases within various dictionaries
and linguistic resources, the multiple-word asso-
ciation responses of category 3 may provide fur-
ther insights into how such items are stored and
processed. Moreover, categories 4 and 5 clearly
suggest that free word association norms can be a
very useful resource for evaluating and further
improving morphological analyzers, as well as
corpus query tools.

5.1 Linguistic Approaches to Association
Data and Its Potential
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981741935484">
As previously commented, Deese (1965) and
Cramer (1968) have both argued that word asso-
ciations closely mirror the structured patterns of
relations that exist among concepts. Indeed, as
Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) note, Deese
(1965) was the first to conduct linguistic analyses
of word association norms, such as measure-
ments of semantic similarity based on his convic-
tions that similar words evoke similar word asso-
ciation responses—an approach that is somewhat
reminiscent of Church and Hanks’ (1990) notion
of mutual information.
However, as we have also remarked already,
the linguistic value of word association data has,
regrettably, been largely overlooked. In a similar
spirit to Hirst’s (2004) claim that, notwithstand-
ing certain caveats on the complex relationships
between them, a lexicon can often serve as a use-
ful basis for developing a practical ontology, we
believe that a very promising approach to orga-
nizing the lexicon would be to more fully appre-
ciate and utilize the rich variety of associative
relationships that exist within word association
norms. While the required, more thoroughgoing
investigation into how to appropriately classify
the complex nature of associative relationships is
beyond the scope of this present study, in the
next sub-section, we attempt to highlight the po-
tential contributions that word association norms
could provide to efforts seeking to explore lexi-
cal knowledge.

To illustrate some of the issues for developing
a comprehensive, yet a parsimonious, classifica-

briefly consider the notion proposed by Zock and
Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006) of word search
strategies in electronic dictionaries based on as-
sociations. Their outline of how such a look-up
system might function employs three kinds of
basic association relationships; namely, ‘a kind
of’ (AKO), ‘subtype’ (ISA), and ‘typically in-
volved object, relation or actor’ (TIORA). While
we accept that the limited set of just three types
was probably motivated primarily in the interests
of simplicity, given Zock’s (2006) suggestion to
enhance the navigability of the system by catego-
rizing relationships, clearly the classification of
association relationships is a fundamental issue.
Table 3 presents a tentative classification of
the word association responses for the noun win-
ter. As the comparisons introduced in Section 4
clearly demonstrate, it is usually possible to ex-
tract the modification and lexical sibling rela-
tionships included in Table 3 from corpora with
corpus query tools such as SkE. However, the
comparisons also highlighted the fact that it is far
more difficult to identify the kinds of relation-
ships classified in Table 3 as typically associated
with such linguistic resources alone. While high-
ly provisional in nature, we believe that the at-
tempt to classify the association relationships
within the association responses for fuyu can

serve to highlight some important issues for Zock
and Bilac’s (2004) approach.
While the lexical siblings relationships be-
tween fuyu and the two response words of natsu
(A summer) and haru ( spring) could feasibly
be represented by AKO or ISA relationship links
to shiki (N-* the four seasons) outside of the
association set itself, having to rely on external
references would not be a very satisfactory ap-
proach to classifying the direct association rela-
tionships. Incidentally, although the ‘hyponyms
of ‘seasons” description would seem fairly natu-
ral from the perspective of a thesaurus, the ab-
sence of aki (5C autumn) from the set would in-
dicate that the strengths of associations can vary
even among lexical siblings (although the ab-
sence of aki from the present data could simply
be due to sampling issues).
Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of sev-
eral modification relationships is not very sur-
prising, at least not for the prime associate of
samui ( L N cold), but the idea of fuyu having a
color attribute is perhaps initially more startling
(while one many not expect ‘winter’ to have a
default color slot within its range of attributes,
the association of shiroi (k L N white) with fuyu
is initiatively appealing).
For the fuyu association set, the most relevant
of the association relationships specified by Zock
and Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship.
However, even for this relatively small associa-
tion set containing just 11 main relationship
types, because seven of them can be initially
classified as ‘typically associated’, clearly this
designation alone is too encompassing to be a
useful classification category. The inclusion of
the description field in Table 3 is an attempt to
further define meaningful sub-categories. In the
case of the sub-category ‘meteorological pheno-
mena’, it would seem to be well motivated to
explain the associations between fuyu as the sti-
mulus word and yuki (T snow) and kōri (7K ice)
as two response words. However, while the sub-
category of ‘cultural artifacts’ clearly goes some
way to pinpointing the underlying association
between fuyu and kotatsu (:ftD), it does rely
on a certain cultural familiarity with the kind of
quilted kind of blanket that are used for keeping
one’s legs warm when sitting around a low fami-
ly table during winter. A natural association for
anyone who has ever lived in Japan during the
winter months, but ‘typically associated’ + ‘cul-
tural artifact’ seems to miss something of the
naturalness.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952535714286">
This paper has compared the lexical relationships
observed within Japanese collocation data ex-
tracted from a large corpus using the Japanese
language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool
and the relationships found within Japanese word
association sets taken from the large-scale Japa-
nese Word Association Database (JWAD).
The comparison results indicate that while
many lexical relationships are common to both
linguistic resources, a number of lexical relation-
ships were only observed in one of the resources.
The fact that some lexical relationships might be
unique to word association norms demonstrates
the value of word association databases as lin-
guistic resources. The present findings suggest
that both resources can be effectively used in
combination in order to provide more compre-
hensive coverage of the wide range of lexical
relationships.
Finally, we presented a tentative classification
of the association relationships in the association
set for fuyu. Our brief discussion of the classifi-
cation sought to reflect on some of the challenges
to realizing a principled association-based organ-
ization of the lexicon as a fundamental step to-
ward implementing cognitively-salient word-
search strategies based on associations in elec-
tronic dictionaries.

Specifically, we conduct some initial comparisons of the lexical relationships observed within Japanese collocation data, as extracted from a large corpus with the Japanese language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanović et al., 2008), with those found within Japanese word association sets, which were created through the ongoing construction of the large-scale Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007). Interesting similarities and differences between the two language resources in terms of captured lexical relationships affirm the value of word association databases as rich linguistic resources. In concluding, we speculate briefly on how the wider range of lexical relationships identifiable through the combination of collocation data and word associ1 Coling 2008: Proceedings of the workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (COGALEX 2008), pages 1–8 Manchester, August 2008 ation databases could be utilized in organizing lexical entries within electronic dictionaries in ways that ar</context>

(1998), consisting of nearly three-quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words. Another database deserving mention is the Russian Association Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al. (1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately 23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (cited in Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004). 3 Japanese Language Resources This section introduces the Japanese language resources utilized in this study: namely, the Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi6 et al., 2008) and the Japanese Word Association Database (Joyce, 2005, 2007). 3.1 Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus The Japanese version of SkE is based on JpWaC (Erjavec et al., 2007; Srdanovi6 et al., 2008), which is a 400-million word Japanese web corpus that has been morphologically analyzed and POS-tagged with the ChaSen tool (http://chasen.naist.jp/). The Word Sketches are based on Japanese grammatical analysis results (gramrel file), where 22 grammatical relations are defined based on ChaSen PoS tags and tokens (Srdanovi6 et al 2008). Figure 1 presents 2 parts of word sketches for the noun fuyu (冬 winter), showing adjective modifications and two verb </context>

While Umemoto’s (1969) survey collected associations from 1,000 university students, the limited set of just 210 words merely underscores the deficient. More recently, Okamoto and Ishizaki (2001) compiled an Associative Concept Dictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 word association responses provided by 10 respondents for 1,656 nouns. However, it should be noted that the ACD is not strictly free association data because response category was specified as part of the task. Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007), the Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a very large-scale database of free word association norms for the Japanese language in terms of both the number of stimulus items and the numbers of association responses collected. The present JWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japanese kanji and words. The currently available JWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of 104,800 free word association responses collected through a paper questionnaire survey with a sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50 respondents.

This approach is similar to conventional techniques for automatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998). 2.2 Word Association Norms In contrast to the Word Sketch collocation and thesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basic input language resource, databases of word association norms are the results of psychological experiments. The free word association task typically asks the respondent to respond with the first semantically-related word that comes to mind on presentation of a stimulus word. The collection of word association normative data can be traced back to the seminal study by Kent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered word association responses for a list of 100 stimulus words. However, despite the insightful remarks of Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that word associations closely mirror the structured patterns of relations that exist among concepts—claims that undoubtedly warrant further investigation— there are, unfortunately, still relatively few largescale databases of word association norms. The notable exceptions for the English language include the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus (EAT) (Kiss et al., 1973), which consists of approximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus list of 8,400 wo</context>

These include fast concordancing, grammatical processing, ‘word sketching’ (one-page summaries of a word’s grammatical and collocation behavior), a distributional thesaurus, and robot use. SkE has been applied to a number of languages. In this study, we utilize the Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions for the Japanese language. As both tools process raw collocation data by organizing words according to grammatical and lexical relationships, they are particularly suited to the conducted comparisons with the word association</context>

The comparison results indicate that while some relationships are common to both linguistic resources, many lexical relationships are only observed in one resource. These findings suggest that both resources are necessary in order to more adequately cover the diverse range of lexical relationships. Finally, the paper reflects briefly on the implementation of association-based word-search strategies into electronic dictionaries proposed by Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006). 1 Introduction Large-scale corpora and various corpus query tools have long been recognized as extremely important language resources.

These include fast concordancing, grammatical processing, ‘word sketching’ (one-page summaries of a word’s grammatic</context>

Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of several modification relationships is not very surprising, at least not for the prime associate of samui ( L N cold), but the idea of fuyu having a color attribute is perhaps initially more startling (while one many not expect ‘winter’ to have a default color slot within its range of attributes, the association of shiroi (k L N white) with fuyu is initiatively appealing). For the fuyu association set, the most relevant of the association relationships specified by Zock and Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship. However, even for this relatively small association set containing just 11 main relationship types, because seven of them can be initially classified as ‘typically associated’, clearly this designation alone is too encompassing to be a useful classification category. The inclusion of the description field in Table 3 is an attempt to further define meaningful sub-categories. In the case of the sub-category ‘meteorological phenomena’, it would seem to be well motivated to explain the associations between fuyu as the stimulus word and yuki (T snow) and kōri (7K ice) as</context>
