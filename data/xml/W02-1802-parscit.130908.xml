Despite progress in the development of
computational means, human input is still
critical in the production of consistent and
useable aligned corpora and term banks. This
is especially true for specialized corpora and
term banks whose end-users are often
professionals with very stringent
requirements for accuracy, consistency and
coverage. In the compilation of a high quality
Chinese-English legal glossary for ELDoS
project, we have identified a number of issues
that make the role human input critical for
term alignment and extraction. They include
the identification of low frequency terms,
paraphrastic expressions, discontinuous units,
and maintaining consistent term granularity,
etc. Although manual intervention can more
satisfactorily address these issues, steps must
also be taken to address intra- and
inter-annotator inconsistency.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957228070175">
Multilingual terminology is an important
language resource for a range of natural language
processing tasks such as machine translation and
cross-lingual information retrieval. The
compilation of multilingual terminology is often
time-consuming and involves much manual
labour to be of practical use. Aligning texts of
typologically different languages such as Chinese
and English is even more challenging because of
the significant differences in lexicon, syntax,
semantics and styles. The discussion in the paper
is based on issues arising from the extraction of
bilingual legal terms from aligned
Chinese-English legal corpus in the
implementation of a bilingual a text retrieval
system for the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government.
Much attention in computational
terminology has been directed to the development
of algorithms for extraction from parallel texts.
For example, Chinese-English (Wu and Xia 1995),
Swedish-English-Polish (Borin 2000), and
Chinese-Korean (Huang and Choi 2000). Despite
considerable progress, bilingual terminology so
generated is often not ready for immediate and
practical use. Machine extraction is often the first
step of terminology extraction and must be used in
conjunction with rigorous and well-managed
manual efforts which are critical for the
production of consistent and useable multilingual
terminology. However, there has been relatively
little discussion on the significance of human
intervention. The process is far from being
straightforward because of the different purposes
of alignment, the requirements of target users and
the corpus type. Indeed, there remain many
problematical issues that will not be easy to be
resolved satisfactorily by computational means in
the near future, especially when typologically
different languages are involved, and must require
considerable manual intervention. Unfortunately,
such critical manual input has often been treated as
an obscure process. As with other human cognitive
process (T’sou et al. 1998), manual terminology
markup is not a straightforward task and many
issues deserve closer investigation.
In this paper, we will present some
significant issues for Chinese-English alignment
and term extraction for the construction of a
bilingual legal glossary. Section 2 describes the
background of the associated bilingual alignment
project. Section 3 discusses the necessity of
manual input in bilingual alignment, and some
principles adopted in the project to address these
issues. Section 4 provides an outline for further
works to improve terminology management,
followed by a conclusion in Section 5.

2.1 Bilingual Legal Terminology in Hong
Kong
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981228571429">
The implementation of a bilingual legal system in
Hong Kong as a result of the return of
sovereignty to China in 1997 has given rise to a
need for the creation and standardization of
Chinese legal terminology of the Common Law
on par with the English one. The standardization
of legal terminology will not only facilitate the
mandated wider use of Chinese among legal
professionals in various legal practices such as
trials and production of legal documentation
involving bilingual laws and judgments, but also
promote greater consistency of semantic
reference of terminology to minimize ambiguity
and to avoid confusion of interpretation in legal
argumentation.
In the early 90’s, Hong Kong law drafters
and legal translation experts undertook the
unprecedented task of translating Hong Kong
Laws, which are based on the Common Law
system, from English into Chinese. In the
process, many new Chinese legal terms for the
Common Law were introduced. On this basis, an
English-Chinese Glossary of legal terms and a
Chinese-English Glossary were published in 1995
and 1999 respectively. The legal terminology was
vetted by the high level Bilingual Laws Advisory
Committee (BLAC) of Hong Kong. The
glossaries which contain about 30,000 basic
entries have become an important reference for
Chinese legal terms in Hong Kong. The Bilingual
Legal Information System (BLIS) developed by
the Department of Justice, HKSAR provides
simple keyword search for the glossaries and
laws that are available in both Chinese and
English. Nevertheless, the glossaries are far from
being adequate for many different types of legal
documentation, e.g. contracts, court judgments,
etc. One major limitation of the BLIS glossary is
its restricted coverage of legal terminology in the
Laws of Hong Kong, within a basically
prescriptive context as when the laws were studied
at the time of its promulgation. There are other
important bilingual references (Li and Poon 1998,
Yiu and Au-Yeung 1992, Yiu and Cheung 1996)
which focus more on the translation of Common
Law concepts. These are almost exclusively
nominal expressions.
In 2000, the City University of Hong
Kong, in cooperation with the Judiciary, HKSAR,
initiated a research project to develop a bilingual
text retrieval system, Electronic Legal
Documentation/Corpus System (ELDoS), which is
supported by a bilingually aligned corpus of
judgments. The purpose of the on-going project is
twofold. First, the aligned legal corpus enables the
retrieval of legal terms used in authentic contexts
where the essence and spirit of the laws are tested
(and contested) in reality, explicated and
elaborated on, as an integral part of the evolving
and defining body of important precedent cases
unique to the Common Law tradition. Second, the
corpus covers judgment texts involving
interpretation of different language styles and
vocabulary from Hong Kong laws. The alignment
markup also serves as the basis for the compilation
of a high-quality bilingual legal term bank. To
complete the task within the tight timeframe, a
team of annotators highly trained in law and
language are involved in alignment markup and
related editing.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961212">
2.2 Need for Human Input
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995567567567">
The legal professionals which are the target users
of ELDoS have very stringent demands on
terminology in terms of accuracy, coverage and
consistency. Aligned texts and extracted terms
must therefore be carefully and thoroughly
verified manually to minimize errors.
Furthermore, many studies on terminology
alignment and extraction deal predominantly with
nominal expressions. Since the project aims to
provide comprehensive information on the
manifestations of legal vocabulary in Chinese and
English texts, the retrieval system should not
restrict users to nominal expressions but should
also provide reference to many other phenomena
such as alternation of part-of-speech (POS) (e.g.
noun-verb alternation) inherent in bilingual texts,
as will be seen in Section 3.
The availability of bilingual corpora has
made it possible to construct representative term
banks. Nonetheless, current alignment and term
extraction technology are still considered
insufficient to meet the requirements for high
quality terminology extraction. In ELDoS project,
many issues are difficult to be handled
satisfactorily by the computer in the foreseeable
future. Although human input is essential for high
quality term bank construction, the practice of
manual intervention is not straightforward.
Indeed, the manual efforts to correct the errors
can be substantial, and the associated cost should
not be underestimated. The annotator must first
go through the entire texts to spot the errors and
terms left out by the machines. In this process,
both the source and target materials have to be
consulted. The annotator must also ensure the
consistency of the output. As a result, guidelines
should be set up to streamline the process.

3. Aspects of Terminology Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999592">
The approach adopted for the manual annotation
of alignment markup and the maintenance of term
bank in the ELDoS project will be described.
Additional caution has been taken in the
coordination of a team of annotators.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998837">
3.1 Term Frequency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994384615385">
An important reason for manual intervention in
bilingual term alignment is the relatively poor
recall rate for low frequency terms. Many
extraction algorithms make use of statistical
techniques to identify multi-word strings that
frequently co-occur (Wu and Xia 1995; Kwong
and Tsou 2001). These methods are less effective
for locating low frequency terms. Of the 16,000
terms extracted from ELDoS bilingual corpora,
about 62% occur only once in about 80
judgments. For high quality alignment and
extraction, failure to include these low frequency
terms would be totally unacceptable.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99991">
3.2 Correspondence of Aligned Units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853714285715">
Because of the different grammatical requirement
and language style, a term in the source language
often differs in different ways from the
corresponding manifestations in the target
language. These differences could be alternation
of POS and the use of paraphrastic expressions.
Although many term banks avoid such variations
and focus primarily on equivalent nominals or
verbs, the correspondence of terms between two
typologically different languages is often more
complicated. For example, the English nominal
(“fulfilment”) is more naturally translated into
Chinese as a verb (“,T-J�”, “��J�”, “��”).
More examples can be found in Table 1.

<tableCaption confidence="0.999842">
Table 1. Alternation of POS
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.699032944444444">
In some cases, there are simply no equivalent
words in the target language. Paraphrasing or
circumlocution may be necessary. Such
correspondence is far less consistent and obvious
to be identified by the computer.

Because of language differences, legal terms can
be contextually realized as anaphors in the target
language. Examples of such correspondence
would be useful for legal drafting and translation.
Again, such anaphoric relations are more
accurately handled by humans.

Most term extraction algorithms deal with
contiguous units, e.g. n-gram. These algorithms
would be problematical in handling discontinuous
units. They include phrasal verbs (e.g. “strike
out”), collocation patterns (e.g. “lodge three
complaints”, “�J#U... These have to

3.4 Selective Markup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999001">
To avoid producing “uninteresting” term
alignment, restricting markup to only terms of the
interested domain would be an attractive
alternative to full-text alignment. In the ELDoS
project, it is possible to mark up only legal
terminology. Other non-legal elements can be
omitted in alignment annotation. This approach
has been accepted by the ELDoS client. Some
examples of legal and non-legal terms are shown
in Table 5.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.998774666666667">

<tableCaption confidence="0.999278">
Table 5. Legal vs. Non-legal Terms
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982526315789">
However, many other terms are more ambiguous.
There is often no hard and fast rule to set criteria
for domain membership. Annotators would have
to rely on their own individual judgement to
decide whether an expression should be counted
as a legal term. For example, the English words
listed in Table 6 are not used exclusively in the
legal domain. However, taking into account their
frequency, legal context and the multiple
renditions in Chinese, they are worthy of being
considered as “semi-legal.” What is interesting
about “I” is that though the pronoun is a common
pronoun, the corresponding Chinese manifestation
“��” is used exclusively in the judgments and
should be regarded as legal. These examples
suggest that the decision to classify a phrase as a
legal term involves a great deal of complications.
Selective markup, however, could give
rise to intra- and inter-annotator inconsistency.
The vagueness of legal terms could lead to
variation in the selection of the same term at
different times and among different annotators. In
ELDoS project, computer-aided markup tools that
can instantly check candidate expressions against
the term bank is an effective reference for
annotators to maintain consistency. Those terms
that are found in term bank should be included in
the alignment. In this way, the term bank can serve
as a working standard for annotators. As for new
terms, our annotators have adopted the principle
that whenever they have doubts as to domain
membership of a new term, they should include
the term in the alignment. In this way, all the
candidate terms are guaranteed to be available for
the term bank manager for final decision.
Inter-annotator differences can also be reduced by
fostering more communication among annotators
such as regular review of peer work.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.673692">
3.5 Granularity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850363636363">
Term granularity is another major issue not only
for machines but also for humans. The
terminology list should be as simple and compact
as possible to avoid redundancy of entries. For
example, instead of having “allegations”,
“corruption”, “allegations of corruption”,
“allegations of manslaughter” as separate entries,
it is preferable to treat only “allegations”,
“corruption” and “manslaughter” as glossary
entries. The annotators have adopted the principle
that a term should be a minimal semantic unit.

<bodyText confidence="0.999531769230769">
Here “semantic unit” refers to single- or
multi-word terms that have acquired specialized
meaning or usage. For example, the phrase “great
and general importance” �������� has
been used ùrøquøntÿy as a frozen chunk, and should
not be further divided into “great”, “and”,
“general” and “importance”. Similarly, “oral
decision” gggjJp7 refers to the verbal delivery
of judgments in trial as opposed to written
judgments. Such decisions involve the support of
real-world knowledge and sophisticated
semantic/pragmatic interpretation and are not
easily modelled by the computer.

4. Further Works

<bodyText confidence="0.99995875">
Bilingual terminology extracted directly from the
bilingual corpora bear the form as it is in the text
corpora. English words with different
morphological markers will give rise to multiple
entries in the resulting glossary. However, from
the user’s point of view, verbs with the same root
but different inflectional markers (e.g. “hold”,
“held”, “holding”) should be combined to form
one single entry. Similarly, variants of Chinese
expressions that differ simply by an optional
markers �� de (see Table 7) may better be treated
as the same item to minimize redundancy.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974222222222">
In this paper, we have studied the importance of
human intervention in the preparation of aligned
corpus and bilingual terminology, particularly
when the specialized language resource and users
are involved. Their demand for high quality
alignment and terminology gives rise to a number
of issues that are difficult, if not impossible, to be
dealt with satisfactorily by the computer. These
issues include the extraction of low frequency
terms, the identification of equivalent units with
different POS or paraphrases, discontinuous units,
consistency of term granularity, etc. Though
human intervention is far more effective in
attaining accurate linguistic processing, if not
properly planned, it could also suffer from intra-
and inter-annotator inconsistency. Regular peer
review and appropriate markup checking tools will
be essential to minimize inconsistency.

The discussion in the paper is based on issues arising from the extraction of bilingual legal terms from aligned Chinese-English legal corpus in the implementation of a bilingual a text retrieval system for the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Much attention in computational terminology has been directed to the development of algorithms for extraction from parallel texts. For example, Chinese-English (Wu and Xia 1995), Swedish-English-Polish (Borin 2000), and Chinese-Korean (Huang and Choi 2000). Despite considerable progress, bilingual terminology so generated is often not ready for immediate and practical use. Machine extraction is often the first step of terminology extraction and must be used in conjunction with rigorous and well-managed manual efforts which are critical for the production of consistent and useable multilingual terminology. However, there has been relatively little discussion on the significance of human intervention. The process is far from being straightforward because of the differe</context>
