Verbal and compositional lexical aspect
provide the underlying temporal struc-
ture of events. Knowledge of lexical as-
pect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore required
for interpreting event sequences in dis-
course (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steed-
man, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing
to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos,
1996), processing temporal modifiers (An-
tonisse, 1994), describing allowable alter-
nations and their semantic effects (Resnik,
1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tense
and lexical items for natural language gen-
eration ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavans
and Chodorow, 1992), cf. (Slobin and Bo-
caz, 1988)). We show that it is possible
to represent lexical aspect—both verbal
and compositional—on a large scale, us-
ing Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS)
representations of verbs in the classes cat-
aloged by Levin (1993). We show how
proper consideration of these universal
pieces of verb meaning may be used to
refine lexical representations and derive a
range of meanings from combinations of
LCS representations. A single algorithm
may therefore be used to determine lexical
aspect classes and features at both verbal
and sentence levels. Finally, we illustrate
how knowledge of lexical aspect facilitates
the interpretation of events in NLP appli-
cations.

Knowledge of lexical aspect—how verbs denote situ-
ations as developing or holding in time—is required
for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty,
1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988),
interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopou-
los, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse,
1994), describing allowable alternations and their se-
mantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and for
selecting tense and lexical items for natural language
generation ((Dorr and Olsen. 1996; Klavans and
Chodorow, 1992), cf. (Slobin and Bocaz, 1988)). In
addition, preliminary pyscholinguistic experiments
(Antonisse, 1994) indicate that subjects are sensi-
tive to the presence or absence of aspectual features
when processing temporal modifiers. Resnik (1996)
showed that the strength of distributionally derived
selectional constraints helps predict whether verbs
can participate in a class of diathesis alternations.
with aspectual properties of verbs clearly influenc-
ing the alternations of interest. He also points out
that these properties are difficult to obtain directly
from corpora.
The ability to determine lexical aspect, on a large
scale and in the sentential context, therefore yields
an important source of constraints for corpus anal-
ysis and psycholinguistic experimentation, as well
as for NLP applications such as machine transla-
tion (Dorr et al., 1995b) and foreign language tu-
toring (Dorr et al., 1995a; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et
al., 1995). Other researchers have proposed corpus-
based approaches to acquiring lexical aspect infor-
mation with varying data coverage: Klavans and
Chodorow (1992) focus on the event-state distinc-
tion in verbs and predicates; Light (1996) considers
the aspectual properties of verbs and affixes; and
McKeown and Siegel (1996) describe an algorithm
for classifying sentences according to lexical aspect.
properties. Conversely, a number of works in the
linguistics literature have proposed lexical semantic
templates for representing the aspectual properties
of verbs (Dowty, 1979; Hovav and Levin, 1995; Levin
and Rappaport Hovav. To appear), although these
have not been implemented and tested on a large
scale.
We show that it is possible to represent the lexical
aspect both of verbs alone and in sentential contexts
using Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) represen-
tations of verbs in the classes cataloged by Levin
(1993). We show how proper consideration of these
universal pieces of verb meaning may be used to
refine lexical representations and derive a range of
meanings from combinations of LCS representations.

A single algorithm may therefore be used to deter-
mine lexical aspect classes and features at both ver-
bal and sentential levels. Finally, we illustrate how
access to lexical aspect facilitates lexical selection
and the interpretation of events in machine transla-

2 Lexical Aspect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999126267441861">
Following Olsen (To appear in 1997), we distinguish
between lexical and grammatical aspect. roughly
the situation and viewpoint aspect of Smith (1991).
Lexical aspect refers to Ole type of situation denoted
by the verb, alone or combined with other sentential
constituents. Grammatical aspect takes these situa-
tion types and presents them as imperfective (John
was winning the race/loving his job) or perfective
(John had won/loved his job). Verbs are assigned to
lexical aspect classes, as in Table 1 (cf. (Brinton,
1988)[p. 57], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behavior
in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that
focus on their features.1
A major source of the difficulty in assigning lex-
ical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbs
to appear in sentences denoting situations of multi-
ple aspectual types. Such cases arise, e.g., in the
context of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al.,
1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995), where
a a &apos;bounded&apos; interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g.,
march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridge
or across the field or by a NP the length of the field:
(1) The soldier marched to the bridge.
The soldier marched across the field.
The soldier marched the length of the field.
Some have proposed, in fact, that aspec-
tual classes are gradient categories (Klavans and
Chodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluated
only at the clausal or sentential level (esp. (Verkuyl,
1993); see (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992) for NLP
applications).
Olsen (To appear in 1997) showed that, although
sentential and pragmatic context influence aspectual
interpretation, input to the context is constrained in
large part by verbs&apos; aspectual information. In par-
ticular, she showed that the positively marked fea-
tures did not vary: [+telic] verbs such as win were
always bounded, for example, In contrast, the neg-
atively marked features could be changed by other
sentence constituents or pragmatic context: [-telic]
verbs like march could therefore be made [+telic].
Similarly, stative verbs appeared with event inter-
pretations, and punctiliar events as durative. Olsen
&apos;Two additional categories are identified by Olsen (To
appear in 1997): Semelfactives (cough, tap) and Stage-
level states (be pregnant). Since they are not assigned
templates by either Dowty (1979) or Levin and Rappa-
port Hovav (To appear), we do not discuss them in this
paper.
therefore proposed that aspectual interpretation be
derived through monotonic composition of marked
privative features [+/0 dynamic], [+/0 durative] and
[+/0 telic], as shown in Table 2 (Olsen, To appear
in 1997, pp. 32-33).
With privative features, other sentential con-
stituents can add to features provided by the verb
but not remove them. On this analysis, the activity
features of march ([+durative, +dynamic]) propa-
gate to the sentences in (1). with [+telic] added by
the NP or PP, yielding an accomplishment interpre-
tation. The feature specification of this composition-
ally derived accomplishment is therefore identical to
that of a sentence containing a telic accomplishment
verb, such as produce in (2).
(2) The commander produced the campaign plan.
Dowty (1979) explored the possibility that as-
pectual features in fact constrained possible units
of meaning and ways in which they combine. In
this spirit, Levin and Rappaport Hovav (To appear)
demonstrate that limiting composition to aspectu-
ally described structures is an important part of an
account of how verbal meanings are built up, and
what semantic and syntactic combinations are pos-
sible.
We draw upon these insights in revising our LCS
lexicon in order to encode the aspectual features of
verbs. In the next section we describe the LCS rep-
resentation used in a database of 9000 verbs in 191
major classes. We then describe the relationship of
aspectual features to this representation and demon-
strate that it is possible to determine aspectual fea-
tures from LCS structures, with minimal modifica-
tion. We demonstrate composition of the LCS and
corresponding aspectual structures, by using exam-
ples from NLP applications that employ the LCS
database.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934555555556">
We adopt the hypothesis explored in Dorr and Olsen
(1996) (cf. (Tenny. 1994)), that lexical aspect fea-
tures are abstractions over other aspects of verb se-
mantics, such a.s those reflected in the verb classes in
Levin (1993). Specifically we show that a privative
model of aspect. provides an appropriate diagnostic
for revising lexical representations: aspectual inter-
pretations that arise only in the presence of other
constituents may be removed from the lexicon and
derived compositionally. Our modified LCS lexicon
then allows aspect features to be determined algo-
rithmically both from the verbal lexicon and from
composed structures built from verbs and other sen-
tence constituents, using uniform processes and rep-
resentations.
This project on representing aspectual struc-
ture builds on previous work, in which verbs were
grouped automatically into Levin&apos;s semantic classes

signed LCS templates from a database built as Lisp-
like structures (Dorr, 1997). The assignment of as-
pectual features to the classes in Levin was done by
hand inspection of the semantic effect of the alter-
nations described in Part I of Levin (Olsen, 1996).
with automatic coindexing to the verb classes (see
(Dorr and Olsen, 1996)). Although a number of
Levin&apos;s verb classes were aspectually uniform, many
required subdivisions by aspectual class; most of
these divided atelic &amp;quot;manner&amp;quot; verbs from telic &amp;quot;re-
sult&amp;quot; verbs, a fundamental linguistic distinction (cf.
(Levin and Rappaport Hovav, To appear) and refer-
ences therein). Examples are discussed below.
Following Grimshaw (1993) Pinker (1989) and
others, we distinguish between semantic struc-
ture and semantic content. Semantic structure is
built up from linguistically relevant and univer-
sally accessible elements of verb meaning. Bor-
rowing from Jackendoff (1990), we assume seman-
tic structure to conform to wellformedness con-
ditions based on Event and State types, further
specialized into primitives such as GO, STAY,
BE, GO-EXT, and ORIENT. We use Jackend-
off&apos;s notion of field, which carries Loc(ational) se-
mantic primitives into non-spatial domains such
as Poss(essional), Temp(oral), Ident(ificational).
Circ(umstantial), and Exist(ential). We adopt a
new primitive, ACT, to characterize certain activi-
ties (such as march) which are not adequately distin-
guished from other event types by Jackendoff&apos;s GO
primitive.2 Finally, we add a manner component, to
distinguish among verbs in a class, such the motion
verbs run, walk, and march. Consider march, one
2Jackendoff (1990) augments the thematic tier of
Jackendoff (1983) with an action tier, which serves to
characterize activities using additional machinery. We
choose to simplify this characterization by using the
ACT primitive rather than introducing yet another level
of representation.

This list structure recursively associates argu-
ments with their logical heads, represented as
primitive/field combinations, e.g., ACTL„ becomes
(act ) with a (thing 1) argument. Seman-
tic content is represented by a constant in a se-
mantic structure position, indicating the linguisti-
cally inert and non-universal aspects of verb mean-
ing (cf. (Grimshaw, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Levin and
Rappaport Hovav, To appear)), the manner com-
ponent by march in this case. The numbers in the
lexical entry are codes that map between LCS po-
sitions and their corresponding thematic roles (e.g..
1 = agent). The * marker indicates a variable po-
sition (i.e., a non-constant) that is potentially filled
through composition with other constituents.
In (3), (thing 1) is the only argument. However.
other arguments may be instantiated composition-
ally by the end-NLP application, as in (4) below.

5 Modifying the Lexicon

<bodyText confidence="0.999772875">
We have examined the LOS classes with respect to
identifying aspectual categories and determined that
minor changes to 101 of 191 LCS class structures
(213/390 subclasses) are necessary, including sub-
stituting act for go in activities and removing Path
constituents that need not be stated lexically. For
example, the original database entry for class 51.3.2
is:

<equation confidence="0.789321875">
(12) (go loc (* thing 2)
((* toward 5) loc

The modified entry is created by changing go to act
and removing the ((* toward 5) ...) constituent.
Modification of the lexicon to conform to aspec-
tual requirements took :3 person-weeks. requiring
1370 decision tasks at 4 minutes each: three passes
through each of the 390 subclasses to compare the
LOS structure with the templates for each feature
(substantially complete) and one pass to change
200 LCS structures to conform with the templates.
(Fewer than ten classes need to be changed for dura-
tivity or dynamicity, and approximately 200 of the
390 subclasses for telicity.) With the changes we
can automatically assign aspect to some 9000 verbs
in existing classes. Furthermore. since 6000 of the
verbs were classified by automatic means, new verbs
would receive aspectual assignments automatically
as a result of the classification algorithm.
We are aware of no attempt in the literature to
determine aspectual information on a similar scale.
in part, we suspect, because of the difficulty of
assigning features to verbs since they appear in
sentences denoting situations of multiple aspectual
types. Based on our experience handcoding small
sets of verbs, we estimate generating aspectual fea-
tures for 9000 entries would require 3.5 person-
months (four minutes per entry), with 1 person-
month for proofing and consistency checking, given
unclassified verbs, organized, say, alphabetically.

6 Aspectual Feature Determination
for Composed LCS&apos;s
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966291666667">
Modifications described above reveal similarities be-
tween verbs that carry a lexical aspect feature as
part of their lexical entry and sentences that have
features as a result of LCS composition. Conse-
quently, the algorithm that we developed for ver-
ifying aspectual conformance of the LOS database
is also directly applicable to aspectual feature de-
termination in LCSs that have been composed from
verbs and other relevant sentence constituents. LOS
composition is a fundamental operation in two appli-
cations for which the LOS serves as an interlingua:
machine translation (Dorr et al.. 199:3) and foreign
language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b: Sams, 1993:
Weinberg et al., 1995). Aspectual feature determina-
tion applies to the composed LOS by first assigning
unspecified feature values—atelic [(OT], non-durative
Nab and stative (01)]—and then monotonically set-
ting these to positive values according to the pres-
ence of certain constituents.
The formal specification of the aspectual feature
determination algorithm is shown in Figure 1. The
first step initializes all aspect ual values to be un-

GO); if there is a match, the LCS is assumed to be
[-FT]. In this case, the top node is further checked for
membership in sets that indicate dynamicity [-ED]
and durativity [+R]. Then the top node is exam-
ined for membership in a set of atelicity indicators
(ACT, BE, STAY); if there is a match, the LCS is
further examined for inclusion of a telicizing com-
ponent, i.e., TO, TOWARD, FORTemp. The LCS
is assumed to be [0T] unless one of these telicizing
components is present. In either case, the top node
is further checked for membership in sets that indi-
cate dynamicity [4-D] and durativity [-ER]. Finally,
the results of telicity, dynamicity, and durativity as-
signments are returned.
The advantage of using this same algorithm for
determination of both verbal and sentential aspect
is that it is possible to use the same mechanism to
perform two independent tasks: (1) Determine in-
herent aspectual features associated with a lexical
item; (2) Derive non-inherent aspectual features as-
sociated with combinations of lexical items.
Note, for example, that adding the path to the
bridge to the [0telic] verb entry in (3) establishes
a [+telic] value for the sentence as a whole, an in-
terpretation available by the same algorithm that
identifies verbs as telic in the LCS lexicon:

<equation confidence="0.927341714285714">

(act loc (* thing 1) (by march 26))
(ii) [-Ftelic]:

(act loc (soldier) (by march))
(to loc (soldier)
(at loc (soldier) (bridge))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934333333333">
In our applications, access to both verbal and sen-
tential lexical aspect features facilitates the task of
lexical choice in machine translation and interpreta-
tion of students&apos; answers in foreign language tutor-
ing. For example, our machine translation system
selects appropriate translations based on the match-
ing of telicity values for the output sentence, whether
or not the verbs in the language match in telicity.
The English atelic manner verb march and the telic
PP across the field from (1) is best translated into
Spanish as the telic verb cruzar with the manner
marchando as an adjunct:

though not employed, as a mechanism in our
database. Thus, we now have a lexicalized exam-
ple of &apos;doing something for a certain time&apos; that
has a representation corresponding to the canonical
telic frame V for an hour phrase, as in The soldier
marched for an hour:
(16) (act loc (soldier) (by march)

This same telicizing constituent—which is compo-
sitionally derived in the crawl construction—is en-
coded directly in the lexical entry for a verb such as
December:

This lexical entry is composed with other argu-
ments to produce the LCS for John Decembered at
the new cabin:
(18) (stay loc (john)
(at loc (john) (cabin (new)))
(for temp (*head*) (december)))
This same LCS would serve as the underlying
representation for the equivalent Spanish sentence.
which uses an atelic verb estar in combination with
a temporal adjunct durante el mes de Diciernbre:
John estuvo en la cabaiia nueva durante el rues de
Diciembre (literally, John was in the new cabin dur-
ing the month of December).
The monotonic composition permitted by the
LCS templates is slightly different than that permit-
ted by the privative feature model of aspect (Olsen.
1994; Olsen, To appear in 1997). For example. in the
LCS states may be composed into an achievement, or
accomplishment structure, because states are part

ties. The privative model in Table 2 allows states to
become activities and accomplishments, by adding
[+dynamic] and [-Ftelic] features, but they may not
become achievements, since removal of the [+dura-
tive] feature would be required. The nature of the
alternations between states and events is a subject

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965">
The privative feature model, on which our LCS com-
position draws, allows us to represent verbal and
sentential lexical aspect as monotonic composition
of the same type, and to identify the contribution
of both verbs and other elements. The lexical as-
pect of verbs and sentences may be therefore deter-
mined from the corresponding LCS representations,
as in the examples provided from machine transla-
tion and foreign language tutoring applications. We
are aware of no attempt in the literature to represent
and access aspect on a similar scale, in part, we sus-
pect, because of the difficulty of identifying the as-
pectual contribution of the verbs and sentences given
the multiple aspectual types in which verbs appear.
An important corollary to this investigation is
that it is possible to refine the lexicon, because vari-
able meaning may, in many cases, be attributed to
lexical aspect variation predictable by composition
rules. In addition, factoring out the structural re-
quirements of specific lexical items from the pre-
dictable variation that may be described by com-
position provides information on the aspectual ef-
fect of verbal modifiers and complements. We are
therefore able to describe not only the lexical aspect
at the sentential level, but also the set of aspectual
variations available to a given verb type.

Lexical aspect refers to Ole type of situation denoted by the verb, alone or combined with other sentential constituents. Grammatical aspect takes these situation types and presents them as imperfective (John was winning the race/loving his job) or perfective (John had won/loved his job). Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes, as in Table 1 (cf. (Brinton, 1988)[p. 57], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on their features.1 A major source of the difficulty in assigning lexical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbs to appear in sentences denoting situations of multiple aspectual types. Such cases arise, e.g., in the context of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995), where a a &apos;bounded&apos; interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g., march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridge or across the field or by a NP the length of the field: (1) Th</context>

Knowledge of lexical aspect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore required for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse, 1994), describing allowable alternations and their semantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tense and lexical items for natural language generation ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), cf.

In the next section we describe the LCS representation used in a database of 9000 verbs in 191 major classes. We then describe the relationship of aspectual features to this representation and demonstrate that it is possible to determine aspectual features from LCS structures, with minimal modification. We demonstrate composition of the LCS and corresponding aspectual structures, by using examples from NLP applications that employ the LCS database. 3 Lexical Conceptual Structures We adopt the hypothesis explored in Dorr and Olsen (1996) (cf. (Tenny. 1994)), that lexical aspect features are abstractions over other aspects of verb semantics, such a.s those reflected in the verb classes in Levin (1993). Specifically we show that a privative model of aspect. provides an appropriate diagnostic for revising lexical representations: aspectual interpretations that arise only in the presence of other constituents may be removed from the lexicon and derived compositionally. Our modified LCS lexicon then allows aspect features to be determined algorithmically both from the verbal lexicon and from composed structures built from verbs an</context>

Similarly, stative verbs appeared with event interpretations, and punctiliar events as durative. Olsen &apos;Two additional categories are identified by Olsen (To appear in 1997): Semelfactives (cough, tap) and Stagelevel states (be pregnant).

With privative features, other sentential constituents can add to features provided by the verb but not remove them. On this analysis, the activity features of march ([+durative, +dynamic]) propagate to the sentences in (1). with [+telic] added by the NP or PP, yielding an accomplishment inter</context>

The ability to determine lexical aspect, on a large scale and in the sentential context, therefore yields an important source of constraints for corpus analysis and psycholinguistic experimentation, as well as for NLP applications such as machine translation (Dorr et al., 1995b) and foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995a; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995).

Such cases arise, e.g., in the context of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995), where a a &apos;bounded&apos; interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g., march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridge or across the field or by a NP the length of the field: (1) The soldier marched to the bridge. The soldier marched across the field. The soldier marched the length of the field. Some have proposed, in fact, that aspectual classes are gradient categories (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluated only at the clausal or sentential level (esp.

Consequently, the algorithm that we developed for verifying aspectual conformance of the LOS database is also directly applicable to aspectual feature determination in LCSs that have been composed from verbs and other relevant sentence constituents. LOS composition is a fundamental operation in two applications for which the LOS serves as an interlingua: machine translation (Dorr et al.. 199:3) and foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b: Sams, 1993: Weinberg et al., 1995). Aspectual feature determination applies to the composed LOS by first assigning unspecified feature values—atelic [(OT], non-durative Nab and stative (01)]—and then monotonically setting these to positive values according to the presence of certain constituents. The formal specification of the aspectual feature determination algorithm is shown in Figure 1. The first step initializes all aspect ual values to be unspecified.

Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes, as in Table 1 (cf. (Brinton, 1988)[p. 57], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on their features.1 A major source of the difficulty in assigning lexical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbs to appear in sentences denoting situations of multiple aspectual types. Such cases arise, e.g., in the context of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995), where a a &apos;bounded&apos; interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g., march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridge or across the field or by a NP the length of the field: (1) The soldier marched to the bridge. The soldier marched across the field. The soldier marched the length of the field. Some have proposed, in fact, that aspectual classes are gradient categories (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluated only at the clausal or sentential level (esp.

Lexical aspect refers to Ole type of situation denoted by the verb, alone or combined with other sentential constituents. Grammatical aspect takes these situation types and presents them as imperfective (John was winning the race/loving his job) or perfective (John had won/loved his job). Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes, as in Table 1 (cf. (Brinton, 1988)[p. 57], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on their features.1 A major source of the difficulty in assigning lexical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbs </context>

The soldier marched across the field. The soldier marched the length of the field. Some have proposed, in fact, that aspectual classes are gradient categories (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluated only at the clausal or sentential level (esp. (Verkuyl, 1993); see (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992) for NLP applications). Olsen (To appear in 1997) showed that, although sentential and pragmatic context influence aspectual interpretation, input to the context is constrained in large part by verbs&apos; aspectual information. In particular, she showed that the positively marked features did not vary: [+telic] verbs such as win were always bounded, for example, In contrast, the negatively marked features could be changed by other sentence constituents or pragmatic context: [-telic] verbs like march could therefore be made [+telic]. Similarly, stative verbs appear</context>
