A general, reusable computational resource has been de-
veloped within the Penman text generation project for
organizing domain knowledge appropriately for linguis-
tic realization. This resource, called the upper model,
provides a domain- and task-independent classification
system that supports sophisticated natural language
processing while significantly simplifying the interface
between domain-specific knowledge and general linguis-
tic resources. This paper presents the results of our ex-
periences in designing and using the upper model in a
variety of applications over the past 5 years. In par-
ticular, we present our conclusions concerning the ap-
propriate organization of an upper model, its domain-
independence, and the types of interrelationships that
need to be supported between upper model and gram-
mar and semantics.
Introduction: interfacing with a text
generation system
Consider the task of interfacing a domain-independent,
reusable, general text generation system with a partic-
ular application domain, in order to allow that appli-
cation to express system-internal information in one or
more natural languages. Internal information needs to
be related to strategies for expressing it. This could
be done in a domain-specific way by coding how the
application domain requires its information to appear.
This is clearly problematic, however: it requires de-
tailed knowledge on the part of the system builder both
of how the generator controls its output forms and the
kinds of information that the application domain con-
tains. A more general solution to the interfacing prob-
lem is thus desirable.
We have found that the definition of a mapping be-
tween knowledge and its linguistic expression is facil-
itated if it is possible to classify any particular in-
stances of facts, states of affairs, situations, etc. that
occur in terms of a set of general objects and re-
lations of specified types that behave systematically
with respect to their possible linguistic realizations.
This approach has been followed within the PENMAN
text generation system [Mann and Matthiessen, 1985;
The Penman Project, 1989] where, over the past 5
years, we have been developing and using an extensive,
domain- and task-independent organization of knowl-
edge that supports natural language generation: this
level of organization is called the upper model [Bate-
man et al., 1990; Mann, 1985; Moore and Arens, 1985].
The majority of natural language processing systems
currently planned or under development are now recog-
nizing the necessity of some level of abstract &apos;semantic&apos;
organization similar to the upper model that classifies
knowledge so that it may be more readily expressed
linguistically.&apos; However, they mostly suffer from either
a lack of theoretical constraint concerning their internal
contents and organization and the necessary mappings
between them and surface realization, or a lack of ab-
straction which binds them too closely with linguistic
form. It is important both that the contents of such
a level of abstraction be motivated on good theoretical
grounds and that the mapping between that level and
linguistic form is specifiable.
Our extensive experiences with the implementation
and use of a level of semantic organization of this kind
within the PENMAN system now permit us to state some
clear design criteria and a well-developed set of neces-
sary functionalities.
The Upper Model&apos;s Contribution to the
Solution to the Interface Problem:
Domain independence and reusability
The upper model decomposes the mapping problem by
establishing a level of linguistically motivated knowl-
edge organization specifically constructed as a reponse
&apos;Including, for example: the Functional Sentence Struc-
ture of XTRA: [Allgayer et al., 1989]; [Chen and Cha,
1988]; [Dahlgren et at., 1989]; POLYGLOSS: [Emele et at.,
1990]; certain of the Domain and Text Structure Objects
Of SPOKESMAN: [Meteer, 1989]; TRANSLATOR: [Nirellberg et
at., 1987]; the Semantic Relations of EUROTRA-D: [Steiner
et at., 1987]; JANUS: [Weischedel, 1989]. Space naturally
precludes detailed comparisons here: see [Bateman, 1990]
for further discussion.

to the task of constraining linguistic realizations2; gen-
erally we refer to this level of organization as mean-
ing rather than as knowledge in order to distinguish
it from language-independent knowledge and to em-
phasize its tight connection with linguistic forms (cf.
[Matthiessen, 1987:259-260]). While it may not be rea-
sonable to insist that application domains organize their
knowledge in terms that respect linguistic realizations
— as this may not provide suitable organizations for,
e.g., domain-internal reasoning — we have found that
it is reasonable, indeed essential, that domain knowl-
edge be so organized if it is also to support expression
in natural language relying on general natural language
processing capabilities.
The general types constructed within the upper
model necessarily respect generalizations concerning
how distinct semantic types can be realized. We then
achieve the necessary link between particular domain
knowledge and the upper model by having an appli-
cation classify its knowledge organization in terms of
the general semantic categories that the upper model
provides. This does not require any expertise in gram-
mar or in the mapping between upper model and gram-
mar. An application needs only to concern itself with
the &apos;meaning&apos; of its own knowledge, and not with fine
details of linguistic form. This classification functions
solely as an interface between domain knowledge and
upper model; it does not interfere with domain-internal
organization. The text generation system is then re-
sponsible for realizing the semantic types of the level
of meaning with appropriate grammatical forms.3 Fur-
ther, when this classification has been established for
a given application, application concepts can be used
freely in input specifications since their possiblities for
linguistic realization are then known. This supports
two significant functionalities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998270090909091">
• interfacing with a natural language system is radi-
cally simplified since much of the information spe-
cific to language processing is factored out of the in-
put specifications required and into the relationship
between upper model and linguistic resources;
• the need for domain-specific linguistic processing
rules is greatly reduced since the upper model pro-
vides a domain-independent, general and reusable
conceptual organization that may be used to classify
all domain-specific knowledge when linguistic pro-
cessing is to be performed.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.912073111111111">
2Although my discussion here is oriented towards text
generation, our current research aims at fully bi-directional
linguistic resources [Kasper, 1988; Kasper, 1989]; the map-
ping is therefore to be understood as a bi-directional map-
ping throughout.
3This is handled in the PENMAN system by the grammar&apos;s
inquiry semantics, which has been described and illustrated
extensively elsewhere (e.g., [Bateman, 1988; Mann, 1983;
Matthiessen, 1988]).

<bodyText confidence="0.996731219512195">
An example of the simplification that use of the upper
model offers for a text generation system interface lan-
guage can be seen by contrasting the input specification
required for a generator such as MUMBLE-86 [Meteer et
al., 1987] — which employs realization classes consid-
erably less abstract than those provided by the upper
model — with the input required for Penman.4 Fig-
ure 1 shows corresponding inputs for the generation of
the simple clause: Fluffy is chasing little mice. The ap-
propriate classification of domain knowledge concepts
such as chase, cat, mouse, and little in terms of the
general semantic types of the upper model (in this case,
directed-action, object, object, and size respectively —
for definitions see: [Bateman et al., 1990]) automatically
provides information about syntactic realization that
needs to be explicitly stated in the MUMBLE-86 input
(e.g., S-V-0_two-explicit-args, np-common-noun,
restrictive-modifier, adjective). Thus, for ex-
ample, the classification of a concept mouse as an ob-
ject in the upper model is sufficient for the grammar
to consider a realization such as, in MUMBLE-86 terms,
a general-np with a particular np-common-noun and
accessories of gender neuter. Similarly, the classi-
fication of chase as a directed-action opens up linguis-
tic realization possibilities including clauses with a cer-
tain class of transitive verbs and characteristic possi-
bilities for participants, corresponding nominalizations,
etc. Such low-level syntactic information is redundent
for the PENMAN input.
The further domain-independence of the upper model
is shown in the following example of text generation
control. Consider two rather different domains: a navy
database of ships and an expert system for digital cir-
cuit diagnosis.3 The navy data base contains informa-
tion concerning ships, submarines, ports, geographical
regions, etc. and the kinds of activities that ships, sub-
marines, etc. can take part in. The digital circuit di-
agnosis expert system contains information about sub-
components of digital circuits, the kinds of connections
between those subcomponents, their possible functions,
etc. A typical sentence from each domain might be:

the input

are shown in Figure 2. These specifications freely in-

4Note that this is not intended to single out MUMBLE-86:
the problem is quite general; cf. unification-based frame-
works such as [McKeown and Paris, 1987], or the Lexi-
cal Functional Grammar (LFG)-based approach of [Momma
and D&apos;Orre, 1987]. As mentioned above, the current devel-
opments within most such approaches are now considering
extensions similar to that covered by the upper model.
5These are, in fact, two domains with which we have had
experience generating texts using the upper model.

roles and concepts (e.g., system, faulty, input, destina-
tion, sail, ship, inoperative). Both forms are rendered
interpretable by the subordination of the domain con-
cepts to the single generalized hierarchy of the upper
model. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 3. Here
we see the single hierarchy of the upper model being
used to subordinate concepts from the two domains.
The domain concept system, for example, is subordi-
nated to the upper model concept object, domain con-
cept inoperative to upper model concept quality, etc.
By virtue of these subordinations, the grammar and se-
mantics of the generator can interpret the input speci-
fications in order to produce appropriate linguistic re-
alizations: the upper model concept object licenses a
particular set of realizations, as do the concepts qual-
ity, material-process, etc.

Degree of Abstraction vs. Linguistic
Responsibility
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970969875">
The general semantic types defined by a level of mean-
ing such as the upper model need to be &apos;linguisti-
cally responsible&apos;, in that mappings between them and
linguistic form may be constructed. In addition, to
be usable by an application, they must also be suf-
ficiently operationalizable so as to support consistent
coding of application knowledge. Both of these require-
ments have tended to push the level of organization
defined closer towards linguistic form. However, it is
also crucial for this organization to be sufficiently ab-
stract, i.e., removed from linguistic form, so that it is
possible for an application to achieve its classification
purely on grounds of meaning. It is thus inadequate
to rely on form-oriented criteria for upper model con-
struction because grammatical classifications are often
non-isomorphic to semantic classifications: they there-
fore need to deviate from semantic organization in or-
der to respect the syntactic criteria that define them.
Reliance on details of linguistic realization also compro-
mises the design aim that the applications should not
be burdened with grammatical knowledge.6
6This is also resonant with the design aim in text gen-
eration that higher level processes — e.g., text planners —
should not need direct access to low level information such as
the grammar [Hovy et at., 1988]. For descriptions of all these
Thus, the level of abstraction of an upper model must
be sufficiently high that it generalizes across syntac-
tic alternations, without being so high that the map-
ping between it and surface form is impossible to state.
This tension between the requirements of abstractness
and linguistic responsibility presents perhaps the ma-
jor point of general theoretical difficulty and interest
for future developments of upper model-like levels of
meaning. Without a resolution, substantive progress
that goes beyond revisions of what the PENMAN up-
per model already contains is unlikely to be achieved.
It is essential for constraints to be found for what an
upper model should contain and how it should be orga-
nized so that an appropriate level of abstraction may be
constructed.

Constraining the Organization of an
Upper Model

Figure 4 sets several methodologies have been pursued
for uncovering the organization&apos; and contents of a level
of meaning such as an upper model, with examples of
approaches that have adopted them, along the contin-
uum of abstraction from linguistic form to abstract on-
tology. While the problem of being too bound to lin-
guistic form has been mentioned, there are also severe
problems with attempts to construct an upper model
independent of form and motivated by other criteria,
e.g., a logical theory of the organization of knowledge
per se. Without a strong theoretical connection to the
linguistic system the criteria for organizing an abstrac-
tion hierarchy remain ill-specified; there is very little
guarantee that such systems will organize themselves
in a way appropriate for interfacing well with the lin-
guistic system.7
An alternative route is offered by the approaches
in the middle of the continuum, i.e., those which ab-
stract beyond linguistic form but which still maintain
a commitment to language as a motivating force. This
is further strengthened by the notion, now resurgent
within current linguistics, that the organization of lan-
guage informs us about the organization of &apos;knowl-
edge&apos; (e.g., [Halliday, 1978; Jackendoff, 1983; Lan-
gacker, 1987; Matthiessen, 1987; Talmy, 1987]): that is,
the relation between grammar and semantics/meaning
is not arbitrary. Detailed theories of grammar can then
be expected to provide us with insights concerning the
organization that is required for the level of meaning.
We have found that the range of meanings required to
support one particular generalized functional region of
distinctions in detail, see the PENMAN documentation [The
Penman Project, 1989].
7Furthermore, the experience of the JANUS project (e.g.,
[Weischedel, 19891) has been that the cost of using a suffi-
ciently rich logic to permit axiomatization of the complex
phenomenon required is very high, motivating augmentation
by an abstraction hierarchy very similar to that of the upper
model and facing the same problem of definitional criteria.

the grammar developed within the PENMAN system pro-
vides a powerful set of organizing constraints concern-
ing what an upper model should contain. It provides
for the representation of &apos;conceptual&apos; meanings at a high
level of abstraction while still maintaining a mapping to
linguistic form. This functional region corresponds with
the Systemic Functional Linguistic notion of the expe-
riential metafunction [Matthiessen, 1987], one of four
generalized meaning types which are simultanously and
necessarily made whenever language is used. Any sen-
tence must contain contributions to its function from all
four `metafunctions&apos; — each metafunction providing a
distinct type of constraint. The value of this factoriza-
tion of distinct meaning types as far as the design of
an upper model is concerned can best be seen by ex-
amining briefly what it excludes from consideration for
inclusion within an upper model: i.e., all information
that is controlled by the remaining three metafunctions
should not be represented.
The logical metafunction is responsible for the con-
struction of composite semantic entities using the re-
sources of interdependency; it is manifested in grammar
by dependency relationships such as those that hold be-
tween the head of a phrase and its dependents and the
association of concepts to be expressed with particu-
lar heads in the sentence structure. The removal of
this kind of information permits upper model specifi-
cations to be independent of grammatical constituents
and grammatical dominance relations.
This relaxes, for example, the mapping between ob-
jects and processes at the upper model level and nomi-
nals and verbals at the grammatical level, enabling gen-
eralizations to be captured concerning the existence of
verbal participants in nominalizations, and permits the
largely textual variations shown in (1) and (2)8 to be
removed from the upper model coding.

This states that there are two configurations of pro-

Many such &apos;paraphrase&apos; issues are currently of concern
within the text generation community (e.g., [Meteer,

The textual metafunction is responsible for the cre-

lishing textual cohesion, thematic development, rhetori-
cal organization, information salience, etc. The removal
of this kind of information allows upper model specifi-
cations to be invariant with respect to their particular
occasions of use in texts and the adoption of textually
motivated perspectives, such as, e.g., theme/rheme se-
lections, definiteness, anaphora, etc. Thus, with the
same input specification as above, the following varia-
tions are supported by varying the textual constraints:
It was the electricity being discharged that resulted in
the system breaking down.
The discharge of electricity resulted lathe system break-
ing down.
The system breaking down — the electricity being dis-

These textual variations are controlled during the
construction of text (cf. [Matthiessen, 1987; Dale, 1989;
Hovy and McCoy, 1989; Meteer, 1989; Bateman and
Matthiessen, 1990 and, again, are factored out of the
upper model.
The interpersonal met afunction is responsible for the
speaker&apos;s interaction with the listener, for the speech
act type of an utterance, the force with which it is ex-
pressed, etc. Thus, again with the same input specifi-
cation, the following variants are possible:

etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999814375">
The metafunctional factorization thus permits the
upper model to specify experiential meanings that are
invariant with respect to the linguistic alternations
driven by the other metafunctions. That is, a speci-
fication in upper model terms is consistent with a set of
linguistic realizations that may be regarded as &apos;experi-
ential paraphrases&apos;: the specification expresses the &apos;se-
mantic&apos; content that is shared across those paraphrases
and often provides just the level of linguistically de-
committed representation required for nonlinguistically
oriented applications. Generation of any unique sur-
face realization is achieved by additionally respecting
the functional constraints that the other metafunctions
bring to bear; particular surface forms are only specifi-
able when a complete set of constraints from each of the
four metafunctions are combined. The application of
these constraints is directly represented in the PENMAN
grammar, which provides for the perspicuous and mod-
ular integration of many disparate sources of informa-
tion. The interdependencies between these constraints
and their conditions of applicability are also directly
represented in the grammar. This organization of the
grammar allows us to construct a rather abstract up-
per model while still preserving the necessary mapping
to linguistic form. The value of achieving the abstract
specification of meaning supported by the upper model
is then that it permits a genuinely form-independent,
but nevertheless form-constraining, &apos;conceptual&apos; repre-
sentation that can be used both as a statement of the
semantic contents of an utterance and as an abstract
specification of content for application domains that re-
quire linguistic output.

Summary and Conclusions

A computational resource has been developed within
the PENMAN text generation project that significantly
simplifies control of a text generator. This resource,
called the upper model, is a hierarchy of concepts that
captures semantic distinctions necessary for generating
natural language. Although similar levels of abstract
semantic organization are now being sought in many
natural language systems, they are often built anew for
each project, are to an unnecessary extent domain or
theory specific, are required to fulfill an ill-determined
set of functionalities, and lack criteria for their design.
This paper has presented the results of our experiences
in designing and using the upper model in a variety of
applications; in particular, it presented our conclusions
concerning the appropriate source of constraints con-
cerning the organization of an upper model. We have
found that restricting the information contained in an
upper model to experiential meaning has significantly
improved our understanding of how a semantic hier-
archy should be organized and how it needs to relate
to the rest of the linguistic system. We strongly feel,
therefore, that subsequently constructed semantic or-
ganizations should follow the guidelines set out by the
metafunctional hypothesis; the factorization that it pro-
vides concerning what should, and should not, be rep-
resented in an &apos;abstract semantic knowledge&apos; hierarchy
supports functionalities well beyond those envisioned in
current text generation/understanding systems.

The upper model has been under development for several
years, and many have and continue to contribute to it. The
ideas I have reported on here would not have been possi-
ble without that development. Those responsible for the
present form of the upper model include: William Mann,
Christian Matthiessen, Robert Kasper, Richard Whitney,
Johanna Moore, Eduard Hovy, Yiga1 Arens, and myself.
Thanks also to Cecile Paris and Eduard Hovy for improving
the paper&apos;s organization. Financial support was provided by
AFOSR contract F49620-87-C-0005, and in part by DARPA
contract MDA903-87-C-641. The opinions in this report are

<abstract confidence="0.993409058823529">A general, reusable computational resource has been developed within the Penman text generation project for organizing domain knowledge appropriately for linguisrealization. This resource, called the model, provides a domainand task-independent classification system that supports sophisticated natural language processing while significantly simplifying the interface between domain-specific knowledge and general linguistic resources. This paper presents the results of our experiences in designing and using the upper model in a variety of applications over the past 5 years. In particular, we present our conclusions concerning the appropriate organization of an upper model, its domainindependence, and the types of interrelationships that need to be supported between upper model and grammar and semantics.</abstract>
