In this paper we give an overall description of the
Italian lexical sample task for SENSEVAL-2. In
the first two sections, the corpus and reference

contains some general reflections on the basis of
the Senseval experience about on the one hand,
the overall task of lexical-semantic annotation and
on the other, about the adequacy of existing

The lexical sample corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999333566666666">
The Italian lexical sample corpus (test data only)
consisted of about 3900 instances for 83 lexical
entries (46 nouns, 21 verbs, and 16 adjectives),
with an average of 47 contexts per entry.
The lexical samples were taken from the SI-TAL
Italian Syntactic-Semantic Treebank (IS ST2),
which was still under development when the
Senseval task was organized. This fact implied as
a main disadvantage of the ISST material that
corpus instances were associated with very little
context. For each instance, the context
corresponded to the sentence containing the target
word and in our experience sometimes this proved
to be not enough for a WSD task.
The ISST consists of two sub-components: a
generic and a domain-specific (financial) corpus,
of about 215,000 and 90,000 tokens, respectively.
The annotated material comprises instances of
newspaper articles, representing everyday
journalistic Italian language. As far as annotation
is concerned, the ISST has a three-level structure:
two levels of syntactic annotation (a constituency-
based and a functional-based annotation level) and
a lexical-semantic level of annotation. ISST is
supposed to be used in different types of
applications, ranging from training of grammars
and sense disambiguation systems, to the
evaluation of language technology systems.
For its use in the SENSEVAL-2 task, only the
semantic annotation was used, even if it is

<bodyText confidence="0.999753615384616">
conceivable that a system could make use of the
syntactic information as well.
In the ISST, this was performed manually using
the ItalWordNet lexicon (henceforth IWN, see
Roventini et al. 2000) as a reference resource (see
below for a description). Semantic annotation
consisted in assigning to each full word or
sequence of words corresponding to a single unit
of sense (such as compounds, idioms, etc.) a given
sense number (referring to a specific synset) taken
from IWN, plus specific features created for the
annotation task to account for idioms, compounds
and multi-words, figurative uses, evaluative
suffixation, foreign words, proper nouns and
titles, among the others. From this point of view,
the semantic annotation of the corpus enriches the
information available in the lexical resource.
However, in order to comply with the
SENSEVAL-2 lexical sample format, the only
semantic infoimation used was the sense number
of ISST, corresponding to the sense number of
IWN synset variants, while the supplementary
features had to be discarded. This fact obviously
resulted in a loss of the overall semantic
infoimation available.
For instance, the semantic annotation gave no
information about the specific domain or about
possible metaphoric senses.
Although the original ISST contained multiwords
expressions, no one of them was included in the
Senseval lexical sample.
The selection of the lemmas has been carried out
starting from the analysis of part of the words
chosen for the English lexical sample, since we
wanted to share a minimal overlapping core with
the English list, in order to make the final results
more comparable in a multilingual perspective&amp;quot;.
At the end, the overlap between English and
Italian consisted of only 8 entries, unfortunately.&apos;
The criteria for the selection were the polysemy of
the word in the lexicon, the frequency, and the
actual occurrence in the annotated resource with
more than one meaning.
The average polysemy was of 5 senses per word
(5 for the nouns subset, 6 for the verbs and 3 for
the adjectives).
The average frequency turned out to be rather
low, since the Italian treebank from which the
lexical sample was extracted was still not
complete and we had to select the most frequent
words with at least two senses in the lexicon and
used at least in two of their senses in the annotated

corpus. This led to select mainly words with
quite high polysemy and rather generic senses
For instance, only 12 of the 46 nouns had also
concrete sense.
More importantly, since we had at our disposal
rather low number of occurrences, no training (IA

corpus will be available and hence a training

The reference lexicon.
As it was said before, the occurrences provided
for the WSD lexical sample task were annotated
according to the lexical-semantic database
ItalWordNet, developed within the framework of
the SI-TAL Project&apos;.
ItalWordNet is an extension of the Italian wordnet
built during the EuroWordNet project (Vossen,
1999).
The IWN database is constituted by:

directly or indirectly linked to the Domain
Ontology.
For the 83 lexical entries we provided to the
competitors a hierarchical basic data structure: all
the senses of the lemma organized in groups of
synonyms (synset) plus their direct hyperonyms
and a brief Italian definition.
We also provided a set of semantic relations
(belonging to the set of Euro(/Ital)WordNet
relations: hyponymy, role/involved,
holo/meronymy, derivational relations etc.), but
we didn&apos;t supply the target entries of the relations
(and all their semantic and ontological
information) since we provided only a portion of
the whole wordnet5.
All the entries were provided with equivalence
relations to at least one record of the
EuroWordNet Interlingual Index and with the link
to the Euro WordNet Top Concepts.
The entries have been used as they were in the
wordnet, without making any adjustment specific
for the task at hand. Although the domain
information, so useful in a WSD task, is available
in the model (only with few labels), none of the
provided entries had it, because it has not been
systematically codified and also because almost
all the entries were quite generic. This was a main
disadvantage for at least one of the two systems
competing for the Italian Senseval task.
We are now in the process of evaluating whether a
linking between ItalWordNet and SIMPLE&apos; would
be feasible; such a linking could allow
ItalWordNet to inherit the rich domain
information available in the SIMPLE database.
We didn&apos;t consider the POS-tagging a part of the
task and we provided as corpus instances only
those with the same POS as the previously
selected lexical items, i.e. we eliminated
occurrences of homographs belonging to different
parts of speech.

The low scores are mainly due to the lack of
training data and of domain information. It is also
possible that for some entries of the lexicon the
subtlety of sense distinctions contributed to low
performance of the systems, as it&apos;s shown by
better results obtained with the coarse-grained

General remarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978861111111">
Starting from the SENSEVAL-2 experience, we
would like to make a few general remarks, both
about the adequacy of available lexical-semantic
reference resources for WSD tasks and about the
overall task of lexical-semantic annotation.
One of the well-known problems of WordNet is
the fine-grainedness of its entries in terms of sense
distinction. This is true also for the Italian net,
even if maybe at a lower level: a brief analysis of
the entries highlights the presence of some very
subtle distinctions among the senses. Actually,
during the SI-TAL project, corpus annotators set
up a specific annotation strategy for handling
cases where synsets are numerous and reflect fine-
grained sense distinctions not easily mappable to
the corpus contexts. The strategy allowed the
assignment of multiple senses connected through
logical operators of conjunction (when IWN
senses cannot be distinguished) vs. disjunction
(when the ambiguous context does not allow a
choice among the different IWN senses).
Nonetheless, in the Italian lexical sample used for
Senseval, there are about only 140 cases of
multiple key assignment out of about 3900 corpus
instances.
This suggests that vague or too fine-grained
distinctions are still unproblematic for humans,
but may become problematic for machines. It
could be useful to investigate what kind of sense
distinctions are hardest for systems to make, and
whether or not systems have problems with the
same senses that human annotators have problems
with.
When a stable version of the annotated resource is
available, we will be able to start a more detailed
analysis of the results of the annotation.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99972">
31
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949285714286">
It will be possible, for example, to evaluate the
impact of the presence of figurative/rhetorical
nuances of a sense in the corpus or to consider the
quality and types of the multiwords that, found in
the corpus, have been proposed to the IWN
lexicographers in order to have them added to the
lexicon.
But, above all, by analysing the level of
confidence in the sense assignment, it will be
possible to evaluate the correctness/suitability of
the sense distinction in those cases that generated
doubts in the human annotators. This kind of
analysis would be particularly useful under the
perspective of the organization of future Senseval
tasks.
Another issue to inquiry is whether the adoption
of the wordnet model and the use of the synsets as
information core can lead to a proliferation of
word meanings according to the kind of synonyms
which may replace a given word in a context7.
Apart from this, however, it is a fact that use of
wordnet or wordnet-like resources significantly
correlates with an overall worsening in the
performance of WSD systems compared with the
previous results obtained using traditional
dictionaries. This certainly is an issue to reflect
upon.
Other, more general considerations concern the
issue of semantic annotation in general. It does
not seem correct to talk about the &amp;quot;right sense
distinction&amp;quot;, and to think at the word sense as a
taskâ€”independent information (Kilgarriff, 1997):
the greater vs. lesser granularity depends also on
the task/domain/situation and in principle there is
no upper or lower limit to sense granularity.
It seems that there are areas of meaning that
cannot be easily encoded at the lexical-semantic
level of annotation: sense interpretation may
require appeal to e.g. extra-linguistic (world)
knowledge which cannot be encoded/captured at
the lexical-semantic level of description. We refer
here to metaphors even extended to entire
sequences and not limited to the single word; to
words acquiring a specific sense, strictly
dependent on the context, that cannot be encoded
at the lexical-semantic level; or to the complexity
and variety of nuances implied e.g. by a verb,
according to the type of direct object co-occurring
with it. Not all these shifts of meaning can or

As far as annotation is concerned, the ISST has a three-level structure: two levels of syntactic annotation (a constituencybased and a functional-based annotation level) and a lexical-semantic level of annotation. ISST is supposed to be used in different types of applications, ranging from training of grammars and sense disambiguation systems, to the evaluation of language technology systems. For its use in the SENSEVAL-2 task, only the semantic annotation was used, even if it is 2 See Montemagni et al. (2000a) and Montemagni et al.
