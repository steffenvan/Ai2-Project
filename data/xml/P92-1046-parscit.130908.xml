A pattern in the translation of locative prepositional

way of exploiting this pattern is proposed in the con-

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999525">
Two of the main problems in machine translation (MT)
are ambiguity and lexical gaps. Ambiguity occurs when
a word in the source language (SL) has more that one
translation into the target language (TL). Lexical gaps
occur when a word in one language can not be trans-
lated directly into another language. This latter prob-
lem is viewed by some as the key translation problem,
(Kameyama et al., 1991).
A case in point is the translation of prepositional
phrases (PP). The following entry for the translations
into Spanish of the preposition along demonstrates this
(entry taken from (Garcia-Pelayo, 1988)).
along: por (by), a lo largo de (to the length of),
segon (according to)
Both problems occur here: there are three different
translations for the same English preposition, and the
second of these is a phrase used to describe a sense of
along which is not encoded as one word in Spanish.

Lexicalization Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988163916666667">
It is argued in (Talmy, 1985) that languages differ in
the type of information they systematically encode in
lexical units. That is, languages exhibit distinct lexical-
ization patterns. For instance, in a sentence where both
the direction and manner of motion are expressed, En-
glish will encode motion and manner in the same verb,
whereas in Spanish a distinct lexicalization of these two
meaning components will be favoured (Ibid. p. 69):
Spa. El globo subio por la chimenea flotando
Lit. the balloon moved-up through the chimney
floating
Eng. The balloon floated up the chimney

<bodyText confidence="0.997453555555555">
Here Spanish subio encodes &apos;move + up&apos; whereas En-
glish floated encodes &apos;move + floating&apos;.
Capturing lexicalization patterns of this sort can help
us make certain generalizations about lexical gaps and
ambiguities in MT. In the rest of this paper two lex-
icalization patterns for English locative prepositional
phrases (PP) will be presented. It will be shown how
they allow us to simplify the bilingual lexicon of a trans-
fer based, multi-lingual MT system under development.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.457301">
Evidence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959346964285714">
The two lexicalization patterns under analysis can be
illustrated using the following three sentences (loc =
location, dest = destination):
Eng. She ran underio, the bridge (in circles)
Spa. CorriO debajo del puente (en circulos)
Lit. Ran-she under of-the bridge
Eng. She ran underpath-Flo, the bridge (to the other
side)
Spa. Corri6 por debajo del puente (hasta el otro
lado)
Lit. Ran-she along under of-the bridge
Eng. She ran underdest-Fro, the bridge (and stopped
there)
Spa. Conk, hasta debajo del puente (y alli se de-
tuvo)
Lit. Ran-she to under of-the bridge
In the first sentence there is a direct translation of the
English sentence. In this case the features encoded by
the English and Spanish PP&apos;s are the same. In the sec-
ond sentence the English preposition encodes the path
followed by the runner and the location of this path
with respect to the bridge; in Spanish such a combina-
tion needs to be expressed by the two prepositions por
and debajo de. In the third example the English prepo-
sition expresses the destination of the running and the
location of that destination with respect to the bridge;
this has to be expressed by the two Spanish prepositions
hasta and debajo de.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99569">

<bodyText confidence="0.998536307692308">
Other English prepositions which allow either two or
three of these readings in locative expressions are shown
in the table below.
location path &apos;along P&apos; destination &apos;to P&apos;
behind detris de por detras de hasta detras de
below debajo de por debajo de hasta debajo de
inside dentro de por dentro de hasta dentro de
outside fuera de por fuera de hasta fuera de
under debajo de por debajo de hasta debajo de
between entre por entre
near cerca de hasta cerca de
From the table the following generalization can be
made: whatever the translation P of the locative sense
of an English preposition is, its path incorporating sense
is translated as por P and its destination incorporating
sense is translated as hasta P.
In short, certain English prepositions are ambiguous
between encoding location, path + location or destina-
tion + location. This is not the case in Spanish. When
translating from English such ambiguities can not be
preserved very naturally. In particular, whenever it is
necessary to preserve them (e.g. for legal documents),
a disjunction of each individual sense must be used in
the TL sentence.
In certain cases, however, it may be the case that
only one of these readings is allowed.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.867969" genericHeader="method">
Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993532">
As far as the selection of the appropriate target lan-
guage (TL) preposition is concerned the constituent
which the PP modifies plays a major role in determining
which readings of a preposition sense are allowed.
Deciding whether the preposition is used in a spatial
sense, as opposed to a temporal or causative sense, is
determined by the semantics of the noun phrase (NP)
within it, e.g. under the table, under the regime, under
three minutes, under pressure, under development, un-
der the bridge; that is, a place denoting NP gives rise
to a spatial PP.
There are two cases to consider in disambiguating
spatial senses. In the case of the PP attaching to a
noun, the sense selected will be the location one. For
example
Eng. The park outside the city
Spa. El parque fuera de la ciudad
The second case is when the PP modifies a verb. For
this case it is necessary to consider the semantics of
the verb in question. Verbs of motion such as walk,
crawl, run, swim, row, gallop, march, fly, drive, jump
and climb allow location, path and destination readings.
For instance:
Eng. The diver swam below the boat
Spa. El buceador nadO debajo de/por debajo
de/hasta debajo de/I bote
Verbs which do not express motion such as stand, sit,
rest, sleep, live and study usually require the location
sense of the preposition:
Eng. The diver rested below the boat
Spa. El buceador descans6 debajo del bote
This second analysis is oversimplistic since some
readings depend on other semantic features of the verb,
preposition and complement NP involved. However,
these can be incorporated into the strategy explained
below.
One last point to note is that not all the prepositions
presented allow all three readings. This will be taken
into consideration when making the generalizations in
the encoding of the above observation.

Representation for Prepositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982909090909">
As exemplified above, the translation of a preposition
depends on three sources of information: 1) the word
modified by the PP determines whether the sense of
the preposition may include a path or a destination
component, 2) the preposition itself determines how
many spatial senses it allows, 3) the NP complement
of the preposition determines whether it is being used
spatially, temporally, causatively, etc. To encode these
three sources, prepositions will be represented as three
place relations. The pattern for a prepositional entry is
shown in 1); a possible entry for below is shown in 2).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.776274">
1) P[modified,preposition, complement]
2) below[motion-verb,[path,dest],place]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997575">
The notation here is an informal representation of the
typed feature structures described in (Briscoe et al.,
1992) and (Copestake, 1992). The argument types in 1)
can be explained as follows. &apos;Modified&apos; is a type which
subsumes &apos;events&apos; (denoted by verbs) and &apos;objects&apos; (de-
noted by nouns); the type &apos;event&apos; is further subdivided
into &apos;motion-verb&apos; and &apos;non-motion-verb&apos;. &apos;Preposition&apos;
is a type which subsumes properties which depend on
the preposition itself; for the examples presented this
type will encode whether the preposition can express a
path or a destination (the extra square brackets indi-
cate a complex type). Finally, &apos;complement&apos; subsumes
a number of types corresponding to the semantic field
of the complement NP; these include &apos;spatial&apos; with sub-
type `place&apos;; &apos;temporal&apos;, and &apos;causative&apos;.
The instantiated entry in 2) corresponds to the use
of below in the diver swam below the boat. Such in-
stantiations would be made by the grammar by struc-
ture sharing of the semantic features from the modified
constituent and from the complement NP. In this way
the three translations of below would only be produced
when the semantic features of the modified constituent
and complement NP unify with the first and third ar-
guments respectively.

Bilingual Lexical Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97742875">
To encode the regularity of the translations presented,
bilingual lexical rules will be introduced. These rules
take as input a bilingual lexical entry and give as out-
put a bilingual lexical entry. An oversimplified rule to
generate the &apos;path&apos; sense for a preposition that allows
such a reading is given below ( P = variable ranging
over prepositions, e = the empty type, Iugar = place,
camino = path).
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.833746333333333">
Rule:
FEng [motion- verb , [path,-],place]
Pspa[verbo-movimiento,e,lugar] de
P Eng [motion-verb,[path,-],place] 4&apos;+
POR[verbo-movimiento,camino,lugar]
Pspa[verbo-movimiento,e,lugar] de
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.906573">
A similar rule would encode the &apos;destination&apos; sense gen-
eralization.
The bilingual lexical rules work by extending the
bilingual lexicon automatically before any translation
takes place; this gives rise to a static transfer compo-
nent with faster performance but more memory con-
sumption. Only those entries which unify with the in-
put part of a rule actually produce a new bilingual en-
try.
An example of the &apos;path&apos; rule being applied is shown
below.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.947246571428571">
Input:
below[motion-verb,[path,dest],place] 1&apos;4
debajo[verbo-movimiento,e,lugar] de
Output:
below[motion-verb,[path,dest],place]
POR[verbo-movimiento,camino,lugar] debajo[verbo-
movimiento,e,lugar] de
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.818070666666667">
Note that not all prepositions in the table above al-
low all three readings; for this the allowed readings are
stated in the second argument of the preposition.

In (Copestake et al., 1992) the notion of a thnk is intro-
duced. These are typed feature structures which encode
generalizations about the type of transfer relations that
occur in the bilingual lexicon. That is, each bilingual
entry corresponds to one tlink. Because ilinks are rep-
resented as a hierarchy of types, the amount of data
stored in the bilingual lexicon is minimal. The bilin-
gual lexical rules presented here will further refine the
idea of a thnk by minimizing the number of bilingual
lexical entries that have to be coded manually, since
the bilingual lexical rules can be seen as operating over
thnks (and hence bilingual lexical entries) to give new
tlinks.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987314375">
We have argued that ambiguities and lexical mis-
matches found in English-Spanish translation of PP&apos;s
can be dealt with using ideas from cross-linguistic stud-
ies of lexicalization patterns, and suggested a use of the
relevant linguistic insights for MT applications.
This consisted of encoding prepositions as three place
relations, and of having bilingual lexical rules which op-
erate over the bilingual lexicon to expand it. By for-
mulating regularities in this way consistency and com-
pactness in the bilingual lexicon, and therefore in the
transfer module, are achieved.
The next steps will include the implementation of
the mechanism to drive the bilingual lexical rules, the
refining and testing of the semantic classification, the
isolation of further regularities and the investigation of
other types of PP&apos;s.

Lexicalization Patterns It is argued in (Talmy, 1985) that languages differ in the type of information they systematically encode in lexical units. That is, languages exhibit distinct lexicalization patterns. For instance, in a sentence where both the direction and manner of motion are expressed, English will encode motion and manner in the same verb, whereas in Spanish a distinct lexicalization of these two meaning components will be favoured (Ibid. p. 69): Spa.
