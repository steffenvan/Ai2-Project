This paper details the system NILC USP
that participated in the Semeval 2014: As-
pect Based Sentiment Analysis task. This
system uses a Conditional Random Field
(CRF) algorithm for extracting the aspects
mentioned in the text. Our work added se-
mantic labels into a basic feature set for
measuring the efficiency of those for as-
pect extraction. We used the semantic
roles and the highest verb frame as fea-
tures for the machine learning. Overall,
our results demonstrated that the system
could not improve with the use of this se-
mantic information, but its precision was
increased.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, has gained
lots of attention lately. The importance of this
field of study is linked with the grown of informa-
tion in the internet and the commercial attention it
brought.
According to Liu et al. (2010), there are two
kinds of information available in the internet: facts
and opinions. Facts are objective statements about
entities and events in the world. Opinions are sub-
jective statements that reflect people’s sentiments
or perceptions about the entities and events. Ac-
cording to Liu, by that time, there was a lot of at-
tention on the processing of facts but little work
had been done on the processing of opinions.

Three levels of analysis for sentiment analysis
are known (Liu, 2012): document level, sentence
level and aspect level. The aspect-based sentiment
analysis is the name of the research topic that aims
to extract the sentiments about the aspects present
in the text.
This work presents a system evaluated in the
SemEval Task4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analy-
sis shared task (Pontiki et al., 2014). Our system
participated only in subtask 1: Aspect Term Ex-
traction. In this subtask, given a text, the system
should extract all aspects that are present. There
were two different domains for this task: restau-
rants and laptops.
The goal of our system was to verify how se-
mantic labels used in machine learning classifica-
tion would improve the aspect extraction task. For
this goal, we used two kinds of semantic labels:
the semantic roles (Palmer et al., 2010) and the se-
mantic frames (Baker et al., 1998).
Liu et al. (2012) categorizes the works for as-
pect extraction in four types, regarding the ap-
proach they follow, using: frequent terms, infre-
quent terms, machine learning, and topic model-
ing. This work uses a machine learning approach
that consists in training a sequential labeling algo-
rithm for aspect detection and extraction.
In what follows, we present some related work
in Section 2. Section 3 and 4 introduce our system
and report the achieved results. Some conclusions
are presented in Section 5.

Our system uses a sequential labeling algorithm.
In our work, we use the Conditional Random Field
(Lafferty et al., 2001) algorithm provided by the
CRF++ tool1.
For training the sequential labeling algorithm,
we give as input features for each word in the cor-
pus. The algorithm will then learn how to classify
those words. In our approach, the possible classes
are: True, representing an aspect word; and False,
representing the remaining words.
The goal of our system was to evaluate the per-
formance of the semantic labels for the task. In
order to model our system, we built a feature set
consisting of 6 features.

The use of the first four features is consistent
with the best approaches in aspect-based senti-

we are testing in our work.
In order to extract the features, we used two im-

semantic role labeling system, and the ARK SE-
MAFOR, a Semantic Analyzer of Frame Repre-
sentations (Das et al., 2010).
The Senna system uses a deep learning neural
network (Collobert, 2011) to provide several pre-
dictions for natural language processing. The sys-
tem output is represented in the CONLL format,
the same used in CRF++.
Our first 5 features were directly provided by
the Senna output. In these features, we decided to
keep the IOBE information since the initial exper-
iments showed the results were better with it than
without.
Our fifth feature, the semantic role label, was
retrieved from Senna as well. In the corresponding
paper, they reported Senna could achieve a F1 of
75% for the SRL task.
The example below shows how the features
were represented. In this example, we are only
showing four features: the word, the part-of-
speech, the chunk and the SRL. The classes are
in the last column.

The last feature was retrieved by ARK SE-
MAFOR tool. ARK SEMAFOR uses a probabilis-
tic frame-semantic parsing using the FrameNet re-
source. The ARK SEMAFOR output is the anal-
ysis of the frames present in the text for a given
verb. As our feature set has only word related fea-
tures, we decided to use the most upper level struc-
ture in the frame. In case of multiple verbs in the
sentence, we used the structure for the verb that is
closest to the word of interest.
The following example shows how the frames
were added into the training model. We limit to
show only the word, frame and the class. For train-
ing, we used the full training set with the six fea-
tures plus the class.

domains for evaluation: restaurants and laptops.
For each domain, the organization provided three

Comparing with the baseline, we may noticed
that our submitted system (+Frame) outperformed
the baseline for the restaurants domain but it did
not outperformed the baseline for the laptops do-
main (considering F1 mesaure).
When we look in detail for the inclusion of fea-
tures in our feature set, we may notice that, at ev-
ery new feature, the precision goes up, but the re-
call goes down. We believe this is due to the be-
haviour of the conditional random field algorithm
for compensating for a sparser feature set.
In general, the semantic labels (SRL and Frame)
could not improve the results. However, if we
are interested only on precision, these features are
helpful. This may be the case in scenarios where a
lot of information is available, as in the web, and
we want to be sure about the retrieved informa-
tion. Certainly, there is a conflict between preci-
sion and computational complexity, since the se-
mantic features are more expensive to be achieved
(in relation to the usual simpler features that may
be used).
Despite of that, we judge to be necessary to con-
duct more experiments in order to better evaluate
the impact of semantic labels in the aspect extrac-
tion task.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949166666667">
We presented an aspect extraction system built on
a conditional random field algorithm. We used
a rich feature set with the semantic roles and
the FrameNet upper frames for each word. We
have showed that the semantic labels may help to
achieve a more precise classifier, but it did not help
to improve the overall F-measure of the system.
Regarding the shared task, our system achieved
the second best precision value among the com-
peting systems, but the lowest recall value. Future
work should investigate ways of also improving
recall without penalty for the achieved precision.

Our fifth feature, the semantic role label, was retrieved from Senna as well. In the corresponding paper, they reported Senna could achieve a F1 of 75% for the SRL task. The exam</context>

In our approach, the possible classes are: True, representing an aspect word; and False, representing the remaining words. The goal of our system was to evaluate the performance of the semantic labels for the task. In order to model our system, we built a feature set consisting of 6 features. 1. the word 2. the part-of-speech 3. the chunk 4. the named-entity category 5. the semantic role label (</context>

This work presents a system evaluated in the SemEval Task4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis shared task (Pontiki et al., 2014). Our system participated only in subtask 1: Aspect Term Extraction. In this subtask, given a text, the system should extract all aspects that are present. There were two different domains for this task: restaurants and laptops. The goal of our system was to verify how semantic labels used in machine learning classification would improve the aspect extraction task. For this goal, we used two kinds of semantic labels: the semantic roles (Palmer et al., 2010) and the semantic frames (Baker et al., 1998). Liu et al. (2012) categorizes the works for aspect extraction in four types, regarding the approach they follow, using: frequent terms, infrequent terms, machine learning, and topic modeling. This work uses a machine learning approach that consists in training a sequential labeling algorithm for aspect detection and extraction. In what follows, we present some related work in Section 2.
