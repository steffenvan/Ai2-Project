Collaboratively Constructed Resources (CCR)
such as Wikipedia are starting to be used for a
number of semantic processing tasks that up to
few years ago could only rely on few manually
constructed resources such as WordNet and Sem-
Cor (Fellbaum, 1998). The impact of the new re-
sources can be multiplied by connecting them to
other existing datasets, e.g. reference corpora. In
this paper we will illustrate an on-going annota-
tion effort which aims at adding a manual anno-
tation layer connecting an existing annotated cor-
pus such as the English ACE-2005 dataset1 to a
CCR such as Wikipedia. This effort will produce
a new integrated resource which can be useful for
the coreference resolution task.
Coreference resolution is the task of identify-
ing which mentions, i.e. individual textual de-
scriptions usually realized as noun phrases or pro-
nouns, refer to the same entity. To solve this
task, especially in the case of non-pronominal co-
reference, researchers have recently started to ex-
ploit semantic knowledge, e.g. trying to calculate

the semantic similarity of mentions (Ponzetto and
Strube, 2006) or their semantic classes (Ng, 2007;
Soon et al., 2001). Up to now, WordNet has been
one of the most frequently used sources of se-
mantic knowledge for the coreference resolution
task (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002). Re-
searchers have shown, however, that WordNet has
some limits. On one hand, although WordNet has
a big coverage of the English language in terms
of common nouns, it still has a limited coverage
of proper nouns (e.g. Barack Obama is not avail-
able in the on-line version) and entity descrip-
tions (e.g. president of India). On the other hand
WordNet sense inventory is considered too fine-
grained (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Mihalcea and
Moldovan, 2001). In alternative, it has been re-
cently shown that Wikipedia can be a promising
source of semantic knowledge for coreference res-
olution between nominals (Ponzetto and Strube,
2006).
Consider some possible uses of Wikipedia.
For example, knowing that the entity men-
tion “Obama” is described on the Wikipedia
page Barack_Obama2, one can benefit from
the Wikipedia category structure. Categories as-
signed to the Barack_Obama page can be used
as semantic classes, e.g. “21st-century presidents
of the United States”. Another example of a
useful Wikipedia feature are the links between
Wikipedia pages. For instance, some Wikipedia
pages contain links to the Barack_Obama page.
Anchor texts of these links can provide alterna-

tive names of this entity, e.g. “Barack Hussein
Obama” or “Barack Obama Junior”.
Naturally, in order to obtain semantic knowl-
edge about an entity mention from Wikipedia
one should link this mention to an appropriate
Wikipedia page, i.e. to disambiguate it using
Wikipedia as a sense inventory. The accuracy
of linking entity mentions to Wikipedia is a very
important issue. For example, such linking is a
step of the approach to coreference resolution de-
scribed in (Bryl et al., 2010). In order to evaluate
this accuracy in the framework of a coreference
resolution system, a corpus of documents, where
entity mentions are annotated with ground-truth
links to Wikipedia, is required.
The possible solution of this problem is to ex-
tend the annotation of entity mentions in a corefer-
ence resolution corpus. In the recent years, coref-
erence resolution systems have been evaluated on
various versions of the English Automatic Content
Extraction (ACE) corpus (Ponzetto and Strube,
2006; Versley et al., 2008; Ng, 2007; Culotta et
al., 2007; Bryl et al., 2010). The latest publicly
available version is ACE 20053.
In this paper we present an extension of ACE
2005 non-pronominal entity mention annotations
with ground-truth links to Wikipedia. This exten-
sion is intended for evaluation of accuracy of link-
ing entity mentions to Wikipedia pages. The an-
notation is currently in progress. At the moment
of writing this paper we have completed around
55% of the work. The extension can be exploited
by coreference resolution systems, which already
use ACE 2005 corpus for development and testing
purposes, e.g. (Bryl et al., 2010). Moreover, En-
glish ACE 2005 corpus is multi-purpose and can
be used in other information extraction (IE) tasks
as well, e.g. relation extraction. Therefore, we
believe that our extension might also be useful for
other IE tasks, which exploit semantic knowledge.
In the following we start by providing a brief
overview of the existing corpora annotated with
links to Wikipedia. In Section 3 we describe some
characteristics of the English ACE 2005 corpus,
which are relevant to the creation of the extension.
Next, we describe the general annotation princi-

annotation. In Section 4 we present some anal-
yses of the annotation and statistics about Inter-
Annotator Agreement.

Recent approaches to linking terms to Wikipedia
pages (Cucerzan, 2007; Csomai and Mihalcea,
2008; Milne and Witten, 2008; Kulkarni et al.,
2009) have used two kinds of corpora for eval-
uation of accuracy: (i) sets of Wikipedia pages
and (ii) manually annotated corpora. In Wikipedia
pages links are added to terms “only where
they are relevant to the context”4. Therefore,
Wikipedia pages do not contain the full annotation
of all entity mentions. This observation applies
equally to the corpus used by (Milne and Wit-
ten, 2008), which includes 50 documents from the
AQUAINT corpus annotated following the same
strategy5. The corpus created by (Cucerzan, 2007)
contains annotation of named entities only6. It
contains 756 annotations, therefore for our pur-
poses it is limited in terms of size.
Kulkarni et al. (2009) have annotated 109 doc-
uments collected from homepages of various sites
with as many links as possible7. Their annotation
is too extensive for our purposes, since they do not
limit annotation to the entity mentions. To tackle
this issue, one can use an automatic entity mention
detector, however it is likely to introduce noise.

3.1 The English ACE 2005 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993388888889">
The English ACE 2005 corpus is composed of
599 articles assembled from a variety of sources
selected from broadcast news programs, newspa-
pers, newswire reports, internet sources and from
transcribed audio. It contains the annotation of a
series of entities (person, location, organization)
for a total of 15,382 different entities and 43,624
mentions of these entities. A mention is an in-
stance of a textual reference to an object, which
can be either named (e.g. Barack Obama), nom-
inal (e.g. the president), or pronominal (e.g. he,
his, it). An entity is an aggregate of all the men-
tions which refer to one conceptual entity. Beyond
the annotation of entities and mentions, ACE 05
contains also the annotation of local co-reference
for the entities; this means that mentions which
refer to the same entity in a document have been
marked with the same ID.

3.2 Annotating ACE 05 with Wikipedia
Pages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905772727273">
For the purpose of our task, not all the
ACE 05 mentions are annotated, but only the
named (henceforth NAM) and nominal (hence-
forth NOM) mentions. The resulting additional
annotation layer will contain a total of 29,300
mentions linked to Wikipedia pages. As specif-
ically regards the annotation of NAM mentions,
information about local coreference contained in
ACE 05 has been exploited in order to speed up
the annotation process. In fact, only the first
occurrence of the NAM mentions in each doc-
ument has been annotated and the annotation is
then propagated to all the other co-referring NAM
mentions in the document.
Finally, it must be noted that in ACE 05, given
a complex entity description, both the full ex-
tent of the mention (e.g. president of the United
States) and its syntactic head (e.g. “president”)
are marked. In our Wikipedia extension only the
head of the mention is annotated, while the full ex-
tent of the mention is available from the original
ACE 05 corpus.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998117">
3.3 General Annotation Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989185418604651">
Depending on the mention type to be annotated,
i.e. NAM or NOM, a different annotation strategy
has been followed. Each mention of type NAM
is annotated with a link to a Wikipedia page de-
scribing the referred entity. For instance, “George
Bush” is annotated with a link to the Wikipedia
page George_W._Bush.
NOM mentions are annotated with a link to the
Wikipedia page which provides a description of
its appropriate sense. For instance, in the exam-
ple “I was driving Northwest of Baghdad and I
bumped into these guys going around the capi-
tal” the mention “capital” is linked to the page
which provides a description of its meaning, i.e.
Capital_(political). Note that the object
of linking is the textual description of an entity,
and not the entity itself. In the example, even
though from the context it is clear that the mention
“capital” refers to Baghdad, we provide a link to
the concept of capital and not to the entity Bagdad.
As a term can have both a more generic sense
and a more specific one, depending on the context
in which it occurs, mentions of type NOM can of-
ten be linked to more than one Wikipedia page.
Whenever possible, the NOM mentions are anno-
tated with a list of links to appropriate Wikipedia
pages in the given context. In such cases, links
are sorted in order of relevance, where the first
link corresponds to the most specific sense for that
term in its context, and therefore is regarded as the
best choice. For instance, for the NOM mention
head “President” which in the context identifies
the United States President George Bush the an-
notation’s purpose is to provide a description of
the item “President”, so the following links are
selected as appropriate: President_of_the_
United_States and President.
The correct interpretation of the term is strictly
related to the context in which the term occurs.
While performing the annotation, the context of
the entire document has always been exploited in
order to correctly identify the specific sense of the
mention.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994894">
3.4 Annotation Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846">
The annotation procedure requires that the men-
tion string is searched in Wikipedia in order to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.759212">
21
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999439827586207">
find the appropriate page(s) to be used for anno-
tating the mention. In the annotation exercise, the
annotators have always taken into consideration
the context where a mention occurs, searching for
both the generic and the most specific sense of the
mention disambiguated in the context. In fact, in
the example provided above, not only “President”,
but also “President of the United States” has been
queried in Wikipedia as required by the context.
Not only the context, but also some features of
Wikipedia must be mentioned as they affect the
annotation procedure:
a. One element which contributes to the choice
of the appropriate Wikipedia page(s) for
one mention is the list of links proposed in
Wikipedia’s Disambiguation pages. Disam-
biguation pages are non-article pages which
are intended to allow the user to choose from
a list of Wikipedia articles defining different
meanings of a term, when the term is am-
biguous. Disambiguation pages cannot be
used as links for the annotation as they are
not suitable for the purposes of this task. In
fact, the annotator’s task is to disambiguate
the meaning of the mention, so one link,
pointing to a specific sense, is to be cho-
sen. Disambiguation pages should always be
checked as they provide useful suggestions
in order to reach the appropriate link(s).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.579343470588235">
b. In the same way as Disambiguation pages,
Wikitionary cannot be used as linking page,
as it provides a list of possible senses for a
term and not only one specific sense which is
necessary to disambiguate the mention.
c. In Wikipedia, terms may be redirected to
other terms which are related in terms of
morphological derivation; i.e. searching for
the term “Senator” you are automatically
redirected to “Senate”; or querying “citizen”
you are automatically redirected to “citizen-
ship”. Redirections have always been con-
sidered appropriate links for the term.
Some particular rules have been followed in order
to deal with specific cases in the annotation, which
are described below:
1. As explained before in Section 3.2, as a gen-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98331375">
eral rule the head of the ACE 05 mention
is annotated with Wikipedia links. In those
cases where the syntactic head of the men-
tion is a multiword lexical unit, the ACE 05
practice is to mark as head only the rightmost
item of the multiword. For instance, in the
case of the multiword “flight attendant” only
“attendant” is marked as head of the men-
tion, although “flight attendant” is clearly a
multiword lexical unit that should be anno-
tated as one semantic whole. In our anno-
tation we take into account the meaning of
the whole lexical unit; so, in the above exam-
ple, the generic sense of “attendant” has not
been given, whereas Flight_attendant
is considered as the appropriate link.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956673">
2. In some cases, in ACE 2005 pronouns like
“somebody”, “anybody”, “anyone”, “one”,
“others”, were incorrectly marked as NOM
(instead of PRO). Such cases, which amount
to 117, have been marked with the tag “No
Annotation”.
3. When a page exists in Wikipedia for a given
mention but not for the specific sense in that
context the “Missing sense” annotation has
been used. One example of “Missing sense”
is for instance the term “heart” which has 29
links proposed in the “Disambiguation page”
touching different categories (sport, science,
anthropology, gaming, etc.), but there is no
link pointing to the sense of “center or core of
something”; so, when referring to the heart
of a city, the term has been marked as “Miss-
ing sense”.
4. When no article exists in Wikipedia for a
given mention, the tag “No page” has been
adopted.
5. Nicknames, i.e. descriptive names used
in place of or in addition to the official
name(s) of a person, have been treated as
NAM. Thus, even if nicknames look like de-
scriptions of individuals (and their reference
should not be solved, following the general
rule), they are actually used and annotated as

mention “Butcher of Baghdad”, whose head
“Butcher” is to be annotated, the appropriate
Wikipedia link is Saddam_Hussein, auto-
matically redirected from the searched string
“Butcher of Baghdad”. The link Butcher
is not appropriate as it provides a description
of the mention. It is interesting the fact that
Wikipedia itself redirects to the page of Sad-
dam Hussein.

Table 1 gives some statistics about the overall
annotation. In the following sections, mentions
annotated with one link are called “single link”,
whereas, mentions annotated with more than one
link are named “multi-link”.
These data refer to the annotation of each sin-
gle mention. It is not possible to give statis-
tics at the entity level, as mentions have differ-

ent ID depending on the documents they belong
to, and the information about the cross-document
co-reference is not available. Moreover, mentions
of type NOM are annotated with different links
depending on their disambiguated sense, making
thus impossible to group them together.
Most mentions have been annotated with only
one link; if we consider multi-link mentions, we
can say that each mention has been assigned an
average of 2,11 links (3,077/1,458).
Data about “Missing sense” and “No page”
are important as they provide useful information
about the coverage of Wikipedia as sense in-
ventory. Considering both “Missing sense” and
“No page” annotations, the total number of men-
tions which have not been linked to a Wikipedia
page amounts to 6%, equally distributed between
“Missing sense” and “No page” annotations. This
fact proves that, regarded as a sense inventory,
Wikipedia has a broad coverage. As Table 2
shows, the mentions for which more than one link
was deemed appropriate are mostly of type NOM,
while NAM mentions have been almost exclu-
sively annotated with one link only. The very few
cases in which a NAM mention is linked to more
than one Wikipedia page are primarily due to (i)
mistakes in the ACE 05 annotation (for example,
the mention “President” was erroneously marked
as a NAM); (ii) or to cases where nouns marked
as NAM could also be considered as NOMs (see
for instance the mention “Marine”, to mean the
Marine Corps).
Table 2 provides also statistics about the “Miss-
ing sense” and “No page” cases provided on men-
tions divided among the NAM and NOM type.
The “missing sense” annotation concerns mostly
the NOM category, whereas the NAM category
is hardly affected. This attests the fact that per-
sons, locations and organizations are well repre-

sented in Wikipedia. This is mainly due to the
encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia where an arti-
cle may be about a person, a concept, a place,
an event, a thing etc.; instead, information about
nouns (NOM) is more likely to be found in a
dictionary, where information about the meanings
and usage of a term is provided.

4.2 Inter-Annotator Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999552105263158">
About 3,100 mentions, representing more than
10% of the mentions to be annotated, have been
annotated by two annotators in order to calculate
Inter-Annotator Agreement.
Once the annotations were completed, the
two annotators carried out a reconciliation phase
where they compared the two sets of links pro-
duced. Discrepancies in the annotation were
checked with the aim of removing only the more
rough errors and oversights. No changes have
been made in the cases of substantial disagree-
ment, which has been maintained.
In order to measure Inter-Annotator Agree-
ment, two metrics were used: (i) the Dice coeffi-
cient to measure the agreements on the set of links
used in the annotation9 and (ii) two measures of
agreement calculated at the mention level, i.e. on
the group of links associated to each mention.
The Dice coefficient is computed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.973304">
Dice = 2C/(A + B)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998573772727273">
where C is the number of common links chosen by
the two annotators, while A and B are respectively
the total number of links selected by the first and
the second annotator. Table 3 shows the results
obtained both before and after the reconciliation
9The Dice coefficient is a typical measure used to com-
pare sets in IR and is also used to calculate inter-annotator
agreement in a number of tasks where an assessor is allowed
to select a set of labels to apply to each observation. In fact,
in these cases measures such as the widely used K are not
good to calculate agreement. This is because K only offers
a dichotomous distinction between agreement and disagree-
ment, whereas what is needed is a coefficient that also allows
for partial disagreement between judgments. In fact, in our
case we often have a partial agreement on the set of links
given for each mention. Also considering only the mentions
for which a single link has been chosen, it is not possible
to calculate K statistics in a straightforward way as the cate-
gories (i.e. the possible Wikipedia pages) in some cases can-
not be determined a priori and are different for each mention.
Due to these factors chance agreement cannot be calculated
in an appropriate way.

process. Agreement before reconciliation is satis-
factory and shows the feasibility of the annotation
task and the reliability of the annotation scheme.
Two measures of agreement at the mention
level are also calculated. To this purpose, we
count the number of mentions where annotators
agree, as opposed to considering the agreement on
each link separately. Mention-level agreement is
calculated as follows:
Number of mentions with annotation in agreement
Total number of annotated mentions
We calculate both ”complete” agreement and
agreement on the first link. As regards the first
measure, a mention is considered in complete
agreement if (i) it has been annotated with the
same link(s) and (ii) in the case of multi-link men-
tions, links are given in the same order. As for the
second measure, there is agreement on a mention
if both the annotators chose the same first link (i.e.
the one judged as the most appropriate), regard-
less of other possible links assigned to that men-
tion. Table 4 provides data about both complete
agreement and first link agreement, calculated be-
fore and after the annotators reconciliation.

the mentions of type NOM in most of the cases,

gether with the data about their distribution. An
example of disagreement of type (1) is the anno-
tation of the mention “crossing”, in the following
context: “Marines from the 1st division have se-
cured a key Tigris River Crossing”. Searching for
the word “river crossing” in the Wikipedia search-
box, the Disambiguation Page is opened and a
list of possible links referring to more specific
senses of the term are offered, while the generic
“river crossing” sense is missing. The annota-
tors are required to choose just one of the possi-
ble senses provided and they chose two different
links pointing to pages of more specific senses:
{Ford_%28river%29} and {Bridge}.
Another example is represented by the annota-
tion of the mention “area” in the context : “Both
aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over en-
emy area”. In Wikipedia no page exists for the
specific sense of “area” appropriate in the con-
text. Searching for “area” in Wikipedia, the page
obtained is not suitable, and the Disambiguation
page offers a list of various possible links to either
more specific or more general senses of the term.
One annotator judged the more general Wikipedia
page Area_(subnational_entity) asap-
propriate to annotate the mention, while the sec-
ond annotator deemed the page not suitable and
thus used the “Missing sense” annotation.
Disagreement of type (2) refers to cases where
at least one of the links proposed by the annota-
tors is the same, but the first (i.e. the one judged
as the most suitable) is different. Given the fol-
lowing context: “Tom, You know what Liber-
als want”, the two annotation sets provided for
the mention “Liberal” are: {Liberalism} and
{Liberal_Party, Modern—liberalism-
odernliberalism_
in_the_United_States,Liberalism}.
The first annotator provided only one link for
the mention “liberal”, which is different from the
first link provided by second annotator. However,
the second annotator provided also other links,
among which there is the link provided by the first
annotator.
Another example is represented by the annota-
tion of the mention “killer”. Given the context:
“He’d be the 11th killer put to death in Texas”, the
two annotators provided the following link sets:
{Assassination, Murder} and {Murder}.
Starting from the Wikipedia disambiguation page,
the two annotators agreed on the choice of one of
the links but not on the first one.
Disagreement of type (3) refers to cases where
both annotators agree on the first link, correspond-
ing to the most specific sense, but one of them
also added link(s) considered appropriate to an-
notate the mention. Given the context: “7th Cav-
alry has just taken three Iraqi prisoners”, the an-
notations provided for the term “prisoners” are:
{Prisoner_of_war} and {Prisoner_of_
war, Incarceration}. This happens when
more than one Wikipedia pages are appropriate to
describe the mention.
As regards the causes of disagreement, we see
that the cases of disagreement mentioned above
are due to two main reasons:
a. The lack of the appropriate sense in
Wikipedia for the given mention
b. The different interpretation of the context in
which the mention occurs.
In cases of type (a) the annotators adopted differ-
ent strategies to perform their task, that is:
i. they selected a more general sense (i.e.
“area” which has been annotated with
Area_(subnational_entity)),
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999396571428571">
ii. they selected a more specific sense (see for

iii. they selected the related senses proposed by
the Wikipedia Disambiguation page (as in
the annotation of “killer” in the example
above).

iv. they used the tag “Missing sense”.
As Wikipedia is constantly evolving, adding
new pages and consequently new senses, it is
reasonable to think that the considered elements
might find the appropriate specific/general link as
time goes by.
Case (b) happens when the context is ambigu-
ous and the information provided in the text al-
lows different possible readings of the mention
to be annotated, making thus difficult to disam-
biguate its sense. These cases are independent
from Wikipedia sense repository but are related to
the subjectivity of the annotators and to the inher-
ent ambiguity of text.
Table 6 shows the distribution of disagreements
according to their cause. Disagreements of type 1
and 2 can be due to both a and b reasons, while
disagreements of type 3 are only due to b.
The overall number of disagreements shows
that the cases where the two annotators did not
agree are quite limited, amounting only to 8%.
The analyses of the disagreements show some
characteristics of Wikipedia considered as sense
repository. As reported in Table 8, in the 61,5%
of the cases of disagreement, the different anno-
tations are caused by the diverse interpretation
of the context and not by the lack of senses in
Wikipedia. It is clear that Wikipedia has a good
coverage and it proves to be a good sense disam-
biguation tool. In some cases it reveals to be too
fine-grained and in other cases it remains at a more
general level.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997252631579">
This paper has presented an annotation work
which connects an existing annotated corpus such
as the English ACE 2005 dataset to a Collabo-
ratively Constructed Semantic Resource such as
Wikipedia. Thanks to this connection Wikipedia
becomes an essential semantic resource for the
task of coreference resolution. On one hand, by
taking advantage of the already existing annota-
tions, with a relatively limited additional effort,
we enriched an existing corpus and made it useful
for a new NLP task which was not planned when
the corpus was created. On the other hand, our
work allowed us to explore and better understand
certain characteristics of the Wikipedia resource.
For example we were able to demonstrate in quan-
titative terms that Wikipedia has a very good cov-
erage, at least as far as the kind of entity men-
tions which are contained in the ACE 2005 dataset
(newswire) is concerned.

Naturally, in order to obtain semantic knowledge about an entity mention from Wikipedia one should link this mention to an appropriate Wikipedia page, i.e. to disambiguate it using Wikipedia as a sense inventory. The accuracy of linking entity mentions to Wikipedia is a very important issue. For example, such linking is a step of the approach to coreference resolution described in (Bryl et al., 2010). In order to evaluate this accuracy in the framework of a coreference resolution system, a corpus of documents, where entity mentions are annotated with ground-truth links to Wikipedia, is required.

Up to now, WordNet has been one of the most frequently used sources of semantic knowledge for the coreference resolution task (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002). Researchers have shown, however, that WordNet has some limits. On one hand, although WordNet has a big coverage of the English language in terms of common nouns, it still has a limited coverage of proper nouns (e.g. Barack Obama is not available in the on-line version) and entity descriptions (e.g. president of India). On the other hand WordNet sense inventory is considered too finegrained (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001). In alternative, it has been recently shown that Wikipedia can be a promising source of semantic knowledge for coreference resolution between nominals (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006). Consider some possible uses of Wikipedia. For example, knowing that the entity mention “Obama” is described on the Wikipedia page Barack_Obama2, one can benefit from the Wikipedia category structure. Categories assigned to the Barack_Obama page can be used as semantic classes, e.g. “21st-century presidents of the United States”. Another example of a useful Wikipedia feature are the links between Wikipedia pages. For</context>

To solve this task, especially in the case of non-pronominal coreference, researchers have recently started to exploit semantic knowledge, e.g. trying to calculate 1http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/ the semantic similarity of mentions (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006) or their semantic classes (Ng, 2007; Soon et al., 2001). Up to now, WordNet has been one of the most frequently used sources of semantic knowledge for the coreference resolution task (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002). Researchers have shown, however, that WordNet has some limits. On one hand, although WordNet has a big coverage of the English language in terms of common nouns, it still has a limited coverage of proper nouns (e.g. Barack Obama is not available in the on-line version) and entity descriptions (e.g. president of India). On the other hand WordNet sense inventory is considered too finegrained (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001). In alternative, it has been recently shown that Wikipedia can be a promising source of semantic knowledge for coreference resolution between nomina</context>

In order to evaluate this accuracy in the framework of a coreference resolution system, a corpus of documents, where entity mentions are annotated with ground-truth links to Wikipedia, is required. The possible solution of this problem is to extend the annotation of entity mentions in a coreference resolution corpus. In the recent years, coreference resolution systems have been evaluated on various versions of the English Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Versley et al., 2008; Ng, 2007; Culotta et al., 2007; Bryl et al., 2010). The latest publicly available version is ACE 20053. In this paper we present an extension of ACE 2005 non-pronominal entity mention annotations with ground-truth links to Wikipedia. This extension is intended for evaluation of accuracy of linking entity mentions to Wikipedia pages. The annotation is currently in progress. At the moment of writing this paper we have completed around 55% of the work. The extension can be exploited by coreference resolution systems, which already use ACE 2005 corpus for development and testing purposes, e.g. (Bryl et al</context>
