<bodyText confidence="0.9993149">
This paper claims that reliance on discourse focus to
guide the production of rhetorically structured texts is
insufficient over lengthier stretches of prose. Instead,
this paper argues that at least three distinct attentional
constraints are required: discourse focus [Sidner,
1979, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986], temporal focus
[Webber, 1988], and a novel notion of spatial focus.
The paper illustrates the operation of this tripartite
theory of focus in a computational system
(TEXPLAN) that plans multisentential text.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9917722">
Effective generation of prose demands not only knowledge
of rhetorical structure but also rich models of entities,
events and states, knowledge of tense and aspect, and
mechanisms to track focus of attention with respect to
discourse, time, and space. McKeown [1982] used
discourse focus (DF) [Sidner, 1979, 1983] to guide the
selection, order, and realization of rhetorical schema-based
descriptions of database contents. McKeown suggested
the following focus shift preferences to mediate among
competing propositional content:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9495914">
1. shift DF to an entity mentioned in the previous
proposition
2. maintain current DF
3. resume a past DF
4. shift DF to an entity most related to the current DF
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997045388888889">
The three global registers (past, current, and potential
focus) tracked DF and were updated by examining the
content of a rhetorical proposition (instantiated with
information from a knowledge base) guided by the type of
the rhetorical predicate (e.g., identification, attributive).
In contrast to schema-based systems, recent work based
on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann and
Thompson, 1987] attempts to produce effective text using
plan-based strategies. Only Hovy&apos;s [1988]
implementation of RST has examined the task of
conveying events and states. Hovy&apos;s [1988] &amp;quot;structurer&amp;quot;
uses his sequence RST operator to produce the following
narration of events in a naval domain (where C4 indicates
a condition or level of operational readiness):
Knox, which is C4, is en route to Sasebo.
Knox, which is at 18N 79E, heads SSW. It
arrives on 4/24. It loads for 4 days.
To produce this text, Hovy&apos;s sequence operator is given
a beginning &amp;quot;action.&amp;quot; The nucleus of the sequence
operator allows the text to &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot; and indicate the
circumstances, attributes, and/or purpose of this
action. Similarly, the satellite of the sequence operator
allows the text to indicate the at and/or
details of the next contiguous action in some sequence.
The satellite also includes a recursive call to the sequence
operator for the next action.
Unfortunately, Hovy&apos;s operators, like text schema, fail
to indicate what effects these orderings or the addition of
information at growth points have on the hearer.
Therefore, they fail to characterize the motivation for
selecting among the different arrangements that narrative
employs to achieve specific effects on the hearer (e.g.,
creating interest, suspense, or mystery). In addition, the
plan operator does not consider states as first order objects
in some causal chain (the fact &amp;quot;Knox is C4&amp;quot; is just an
attribute extending off the &amp;quot;en route&amp;quot; event). This is
important because states have complex relations (e.g.,
enablement, causation) to other states and events in the
world. Finally, sequences are assumed to be contiguous
and yet events are often simultaneous or overlapping in
time [Allen, 1984].
This purely RST-based approach was improved upon
by Hovy and McCoy [1989] by incorporating Focus Trees
[McCoy and Cheng, 1988] to guide the ordering and
interrelationships of sentence topics. This combined
approach produced:
With readiness C4, Knox is en route
to Sasebo. It is at 79N 18E heading
SSW. It will arrive 4/24 and will
load for four days.
Text coherence is improved not only by regrouping
content (a result of restrictions on the traversal of the
Focus Tree) but also by using tensed verbs (e.g., future
tense of &amp;quot;arrive&amp;quot; in the last utterance) to explicitly indicate
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999402">
the temporal relations among events. Unfortunately, no
details of how this tense is generated are provided.
Furthermore, examination of human generated prose
indicates that not only DF but additional constraints on
temporal focus and spatial focus are necessary to produce
lengthier prose.
Therefore, the remainder of this paper rust details a
tripartite theory of focus and proposes focus shift rules.
Next an ontology of events and states is introduced that
serves as the basis for a model of tense and aspect which,
guided by temporal focus, is used to verbalize events and
states. The temporal organization and realization of
events is exemplified in the context of report generation.
Finally, an example from a route planner is given to
illustrate spatial organization and the use of spatial focus.

Discourse Focus, Temporal Focus, and
Spatial Focus

Like Hovy [1988], TEXPLAN uses a hierarchical planner
to select, structure, and order propositional content using a
library of plan operators (detailed in a subsequent section).
To achieve a given discourse goal (e.g., get the reader to
know about an event), the planner selects among
competing plan operators using general plan operator
selection heuristics [Moore, 19891 such as prefer plan
operators that meet all preconditions, that have fewer
subplans, that have fewer new variables and so on. The
leaf nodes of the resulting text plan are speech acts with
associated propositional content in the form of rhetorical
predicates [c.f. McKeown, 1982]. As in McKeown&apos;s
TEXT, TEXPLAN tracks past, current, and potential
discourse focus (DF) in global registers. When the text
planner selects a particular rhetorical proposition, the
attentional mechanism extracts the default discourse focus
(a position associated with each rhetorical predicate) and
updates the global registers. This focus information is
then used to guide surface choice.
In contrast to DF, Webber [1988] proposed Temporal
Focus (TF) as the event currently being focused on
temporally and suggests that TF is used to integrate
events into some evolving spatio-temporal event/situation
structure. TF can shift depending on the relations that
hold between events and their times of occurrence.
Webber [1988] suggests three TF shifts: maintenance,
forward, and backward. Nakhimovsky [1988] classifies
local TF shifts as: forward, sideways, and backward
&amp;quot;micromoves&amp;quot;. Forward and backward shifts correspond to
introducing the consequence or preparatory phases of
events [Moens and Steedman, 19881. Backward shifts
start a new discourse segment. In TEXPLAN, TF
indicates the Reichenbachian [1947] reference time. TF
shifts (local or micromoves) are implemented via the plan
operators and are ordered as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.88248075">
1. Maintain current IF (maintenance)
2. TF progresses &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; forward (progression)
3. Shift TF to a simultaneous event/state (lateral shift)
In addition two other long distance temporal shifts are
possible but are not addressed in the current
implementation:
4. Shift TF to a prior event/state. (flashback)
5. Shift TF to a distant future event/state. (flashforward)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999615333333333">
Temporal shifts are conveyed to the reader in part by verb
tense and aspect as in the use of future tense in &amp;quot;John just
arrived. He was in an accident yesterday and ...&amp;quot;
Temporal shifts are also indicated by adverbials (e.g., &amp;quot;five
minutes later&amp;quot;), explicit references to time (&amp;quot;at seven
p.m.&amp;quot;), and cue words (e.g., &amp;quot;simultaneously&amp;quot;).
TEXPLAN tracks TF by recording pointers to events that
appear in the propositional content selected by the text
planner just as it records DF from selected propositional
content following McKeown (1982). As with DF, past,
current, and potential temporal focus registers are updated
after each utterance.
Just as discourse can be topically and temporally
organized, psychologists have observed that humans
utilize spatial organizations, for example when when
people describe their apartments [Linde and Labov, 1975].
Shifts analogous to those of DF and TF can occur along
the dimension not of discourse or time but rather space. I
define spatial focus (SF) as the current entity or group of
entities (and its/their associated spatial location) that the
reader is attending to in space. The notion of spatial focus
is related but distinct from Conklin&apos;s (1983) notion of
visual saliency. Visual saliency is the noteworthiness
(from one perspective) of an entity in relation to a set of
static objects. Spatial focus, in contrast, refers to a
currently focused entity (a &amp;quot;moving target&amp;quot;) that is
spatially related to the other entities currently in the
background (static entities) or foreground (dynamic
entities). Just as DF and TF follow regular shifts, the
following ordered legal shifts appear to govern SF:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986618666666667">
1. Maintain the current SF
2. Shift SF to an entity spatially related to the current SF
3. Shift SF to some distant point or region.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989975">
Shifts in rule 2 can be relational (e.g., behind, in-front-of,
left-of, right-of, above, below, on-top-of, etc.) or in terms
of distance (e.g., &amp;quot;five miles away&amp;quot;). Shifts in rule 3
signal a new discourse segment. Just as TF can refer to
points or intervals of time, SF can refer to either a point
in space (&amp;quot;At 23° latitude 5° longitude&amp;quot;), a region (e.g.,
&amp;quot;In Chesterville today, ...&amp;quot;) or a set of points or regions
(analogous to discourse focus spaces [Grosz, 1977]).
After each utterance, by examining the underlying
propositional content TEXPLAN updates global registers
that encode the past, current, and potential spatial foci. In
the current implementation, the system prefers topical
over causal over temporal over spatial orderings.
The next sections illustrate the input to the generator,
and how TEXPLAN uses the notions of Reichenbachian
time and temporal focus to narrate events and states. By

tracking TF and exploiting the temporal information in
the underlying event/state model, TEXPLAN is able to
select, order, and linguistically realize events and states.
The realization component of the system selects proper
verb tense and aspect and indicates shifts in TF, for
example, through the use of adverbials. A final section
illustrates the use of SF in locative instruction (i.e., route
plans).

Event and State Ontology

<bodyText confidence="0.999909052631579">
As Hovy and McCoy&apos;s example in the introduction
illustrates, more sophisticated representations of verb
tense and aspect is key to generating coherent narrative
text. This demands a more sophisticated representation of
events, states, and their relationship to tense and aspect.
Representing and linguistically realizing events concerns
issues of temporality, causality, and enablement as well as
verb tense and aspect. Discussion of noninstantaneous
events dates at least to Aristotle&apos;s distinction between
process (energia) and state (stasis) and these issues have
been the focus of attention in philosophy, linguistics, and
computational linguistics [c.f. Allen, 19881. While an
ontology of events and states is beyond the scope of this
paper, it is necessary as a starting point for generation to
indicate the nature of the underlying propositional content
and so we make a few intuitive distinctions.
Events are physical, linguistic, or psychological
happenings at some time and place. States, in contrast,
refer to perpetual or temporally unbounded conditions such
as the physical, psychological, or emotional state of an
agent or entity. States include relations that hold between
agents or entities (e.g., possession, ownership)
[Nakhimovsky, 1988]. This classification is but one
(conceptual) classification of events and states. Ehrich
[1986], for example, uses the features of duration,
resultativity, and intentionality to produce an orthogonal
categorization.
Processes, in contrast to states, involve changes or
transformations over the interval for which they hold and
often have some associated rate of progress toward a goal
or a rate of consumption of resources [Nakhimovsky,
1988]. Nakhimovsky makes a key distinction between
events, processes and states:
For a linguist, the distinction between event-process
is one of aspectual perspective: &amp;quot;The term &apos;process&apos;
means a dynamic situation viewed imperfectively, and
the term &apos;event&apos; means a dynamic situation viewed
perfectively&amp;quot; (Comrie, 1976: 51). The distinction
process-state is one of aspectual class.
In this paper the term event is used to refer both to an
instantaneous event (e.g., snap, click, wink) as well as
events with a duration which can be viewed perfectively
(event) or itnperfectively (process).
A collection of related events and states constitutes an
event/state network analogous to Webber&apos;s [1987]
event/situation structure. This network of events and
states serves as the basis for generation in TEXPLAN. In
the input to the text generator, each event or state is
represented in a frame-like structure. Events and states
have associated attributes, roles, and relationships. The
term attributes refers to characteristics local to the event or
state such as its time of occurrence (a point or interval),
its type (e.g., physical, linguistic), and any constituents
(i.e., subevents or substates). Roles refer to the semantic
role an entity plays in the event or state (e.g., agent,
patient). Finally, relations refer to the associated
enablement(s), cause(s), and effect(s) of an event or state.

Tense and Aspect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901444444445">
The rich notions of time associated with events and states
are conveyed in part through verb tense. English verb
tense (e.g., simple past, present, and future; and past,
present, and future perfect) relies on a tripartite notion of
time which includes: the point or time at which the
utterance is spoken (S), the point at which the event
happens (E), and the point of reference (R) [Reichenbach,
1947]. R is the time &amp;quot;talked about&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;focused on&amp;quot; and
in TEXPLAN corresponds to the above notion of TF.
Because the absolute time of the event (E) appears in the
event structure, the linguistic realization component can
select the appropriate verb tense by reasoning about the
time the speaker is narrating (S) (e.g., &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;) and the
time the overall narration focuses on (R). This contrasts
with verb choice based solely on the underlying event
structure [e.g., Kalita, 1989, p. 410]. Table 1 relates E,
R, and S to tense where &amp;quot;&lt;&amp;quot; indicates temporal
antecedence and &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; indicates temporal simultaneity.

<bodyText confidence="0.94673094117647">
This point-based time representation could be extended to
consider time intervals [Allen, 1984].
TEXPLAN&apos;s sentence generator uses an admittedly
simplifiedl prototypical verb sequence following
Winograd [1983] (e.g., Modal + Have + Bel + Be2 +
Main-verb). Individual verbs include both modals such as
&amp;quot;will&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;can&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;could&amp;quot; (which have only one form), and
ordinary verbs which have five basic forms in third
person, singular: infinitive (e.g., &amp;quot;to walk&amp;quot;), simple
present (&amp;quot;walks&amp;quot;), simple past (&amp;quot;walked&amp;quot;), present
participle (&amp;quot;walking&amp;quot;), and past participle (&amp;quot;walked&amp;quot;).
Future tense does not have its own syntactic form and is
implemented by the modals &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot;.
In contrast to tense, aspect is a grammatical category
of the verb implemented by affixes, auxiliaries, and so on
1Matthiesen (1984) has discussed more general tense
assignment.

[Nalchimovsky, 1988]. This arises from the temporal
characteristics of the underlying event (i.e., point versus
interval), the relationship of the reference time (R) to
event time (E) (e.g., E &lt;R indicates perfective; E = R
imperfective) and the lexical aspect of the verb (e.g., the
progressive &amp;quot;I am eating&amp;quot; versus the culmination &amp;quot;I am
finishing&amp;quot;). The current implementation addresses only
the rust two cases. Perfective sequences use Have (e.g.,
has taken), progressive use Bel (e.g., was taking), and
passive use Be2 (e.g., was taken).

The LACE Simulation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980750877193">
With the representation of events and states, their
temporal structure, and their relation to tense and aspect
detailed, this section turns to the task of planning and
realizing narrative. While text analysis motivated focus
models and narrative plans (described below), there was a
practical need to narrate simulation events and states in
complex multi-agent simulations. In particular, narrative
plans and temporal focus were tested in LACE (Land Air
Combat in ERIC), a knowledge-based battle simulation
system [Anken, 1989]. LACE is coded in ERIC, an
object-oriented simulation language [Hilton, 1987].
Narration in LACE is complex because multiple,
autonomous agents interact simultaneously to achieve
their individual goals. For example, attacking forces
attempt to bomb targets, refuel aircraft, move cargo, and
suppress ground forces with electronic countermeasures.
In contrast, defending forces attempt to detect, track, and
destroy intruders. To give a feel for the nature of the
sophistication of the simulation, there are over 150
classes each with dozens of behaviors. In a typical run of
the simulation, hundreds (and potentially thousands) of
instances of objects are generated. If several agents (e.g.,
10 or 15) are given goals to pursue at the start of a
simulation run, their actions generate thousands of events
per minute as agents react to both the environment and to
the behavior of other agents in the simulation. For
example, if a long-range radar detects an intruding aircraft
it will order its associated mobile surface-to-air-missile
sites to electronically track, pursue (i.e., along the ground)
and fire at the incoming target. The generation task, then,
is to produce a report of the events after simulating
conflicts between two opposing military forces. Over
fifty texts where produced, an example of which is detailed
below.
The input to narration generation is a network of
events and states from the underlying simulation. Each
machine second that the simulation clock ticks LACE
records the situations that occur at that moment. The
simulation measures time using Common Lisp&apos;s
universal time (i.e., as seconds since the year 1900).
These event snapshots (e.g., at time 34300023 #&lt;search-
radar-291&gt; began sweeping) are slotted into the
representation of events which includes their associated
properties (i.e., attributes such as location and duration;
relations to other events such as causal and temporal
connections; and any associated roles such as the agent,
patient, and so on). Collectively these structures
characterize the event/state network that represents an
overall spatio-temporal-causal picture of the simulation.
This event/state network is preprocessed to prune details.
For example, persistent or uninteresting (e.g., frequent,
non-unique, or unimportant) events can be deleted.
Accessing this event/state network, TEXPLAN&apos;s narrative
plans select, order, and realize events to compose a report.
Event selection from the event/state network is guided
by the saliency of the occurrence. In the current
implementation, event or state saliency is a function of:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9968322">
1. the kind and amount of links associated with
an event or state in the event/state network
2. the frequency of occurrence in the event/state
network
3. domain-specific knowledge of importance
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995187">
The first item concerns issues such as does the event
achieve a main goal of a key agent in the simulation, does
it motivate, enable, or cause a number of events or states
to occur, and so on. The second item is simply the
observation that frequent or commonplace events are
boring. For example in LACE long-range radar are
constantly sweeping, SAM1 sites are always
repositioning themselves, and aircraft are always flying
point-based ingress/egress mutes. An example of the third
item is that mission types have an order of interestingness
(e.g., offensive air attack &gt; SAM suppression &gt; refueling
&gt; transportation). This is analogous to Kittredge&apos;s et al.
[1986] weather reports which indicate warnings first and
then WINDS &gt; CLOUD-COVER &gt; PRECIPITATION &gt; FOG&amp;MIST
&gt; VISIBILITY. There are other issues involved in
saliency that are beyond the scope of this paper such as
the inferribility of events and states, event and state
persistence, and the representation of perceptual saliency
which requires complex user modelling. The next section
addresses the key problem: how do we select, order, and
present events from the event/state structure in a report?

Report Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977484529411765">
The most basic form of narration recounts events in their
temporal order of occurrence. This occurs in a journal,
record, account, or chronicle, collectively termed a report.
Reports typically consist of the most important or salient
events in some domain during one period of time (e.g.,
stock market report, weather report, news report, battle
report). Sometimes reports focus on events and states
involving one dimension of an agent as in a medical
record, an educational record, or a political record.
TEXPLAN plans narrative by reasoning about what
effects certain rhetorical strategies or speech acts will have
on the user if they are employed. This is accomplished by
representing each communicative act (either a rhetorical
act or a speech act) as an operator in a library of plans
which are reasoned about by a hierarchical text planner
[Sacerdoti, 1977] similar to that used by Hovy [1988] and
&apos;Surface to Air Missile
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998162">

<bodyText confidence="0.999167367816093">
[Mome, 1989]. Communicative acts have specific
constraints, enabling conditions, effects on the hearer, and
decompositions. A rhetorical act characterizes the
communicative function of one or more utterances (e.g.,
describe, define, compare, narrate) and may employ other
rhetorical acts ;and/Or speech acts to ;achieve its associated
goals. In contrast, a speech act [Searle, 1969, 1975]
refers to the illocutionary force of utterances (e.g., inform,
request, warn, promise). The propositional content of a
speech act is a rhetorical predicate whose function is to
abstract particular kinds of information from a knowledge
base (e.g., constituency predicates refer for subparts of
entities whereas classification predicates refer to
subtypes of entities, logical-definition predicates
include the genus and differentia of an entity.) Over
twenty rhetorical predicates and fifty plan operator; have
been implemented that are able to produce a variety of
texts including description, narration, exposition, and
argument.
Plan operators are represented in an extension of first
order predicate calculus that allows for optionality in the
decomposition. Like conventional planners, each plan
operator defines the constraints and preconditions that
must hold before a communicative act applies, its intended
effect, as well as its refinement or decomposition into
subacts. Constraints, unlike preconditions, cannot be
achieved or Owned for if they are false. In phut operators,
variables are italicized (e.g., /I, S, and entity) and
constants appear in upper-case plain type. Intensional
operators, such as WANT, KNOW and BELIEVE appear in
capitals. KNOW details an agent&apos;s speaic knowledge of
the truth-values of propositions (e.g, KN OW ( H ,
Red (ROBIN-1) ) or KNOW (H, (ROBIN-1) )) where
ulah or falsity is defined by the propositions in the
knowledge base. That is, KNOW (H, P) implies P A
BELIEVE (H, P) . Of course an agent can hold an invalid
belief (e.g., BELIEVE (JOHN, Yellow (ROBIN-1) ) ).
KNOW-ABOUT is a predicate that is an abstraction of a set
of epistemic attitudes of some agent toward an individual.
An agent can KNOW-ABOUT an entity or event (e.g., KNOW-
ABOUT (H, ROBIN-1) or KNOW-ABOUT (H, EXP LOS ION-
4 4 5 ) ) if they KNOW its characteristics, components,
subtypes, or purpose.
For example the top-level narration plan shown in
Figure 1 encodes the communicative act of speaker (S)
narrating some sequence of salient events in topical order
so that the hearer (R) knows about them. Similar top-
level plan operators narrate events causally, temporally
and spatially. If the events can be sequenced in several
mays, the planner prefers topical to causal to temporal to
spatial orderings. The narrate-report-topically plan
operator is chosen when there is no obvious temporal or
spatial sequencing, for example, when multiple events
occur simultaneously or when they occur in similar
spatial locations.
After an event/state structure is captured from a typical
ran of the LACE simulation (e.g, some blue forces are
attacking some red targets), the generation of a report is
initiated by posting the top-level goal &amp;quot;narrate all the
events in the event/state network&amp;quot;. This matches the
header of the plan operator in Figure 1 (as well as others)
and the unordered list of events is bound to the events
parameter of the header. This narrate-report-
topically plan operator is selected because (1) relative to
the number of events, there are few principle agents (i.e.,
missions) which enables topical grouping and (2) because
other plan operators are less appealing (for example, a top-
level temporal organization would be confusing because
they are many simultaneous events involving different
agents). The decomposition of the plan operator first
introduces the events using the introduce plan operator
which indicates the static background or framework
within which the events in the foreground are to be
interpreted. The introduce plan operator describes the
principle time, place, agents (i.e., characters) using a
variety of rhetorical means including definition,
attribution, illustration, and division (i.e., classification
and constituency) (see Maybury [1990] for details). In
LACE information in the introduction is retrieved from
the overall mission package which drives the entire
simulation (represented in a frame-like structure). This
package includes the time of the major missions, their
location, their type, and so on. In this case this
information is described using two rhetorical predicates:
logical definition (which indicates the genus and differentia
of the package) and constituency (which indicates the
subparts, in this case missions).

Next the subjects or topics which the events concern
are ordered according to saliency. Saliency is determined
by the frequency, uniqueness, importance, and so on of
events in the domain as detailed in the previous section.
After events are grouped topically in order of salience, the
narrate-temporal-sequence plan shown in Figure 2
selects salient events and then exploits their temporal
order to sequence them.
As plan operator decompositions are achieved, they are
recorded in a hierarchical text plan (a communicative
action decomposition) which records the structure, order,
and content of the final text (see Figure 3). Each node in
the text plan corresponds to a plan operator which
formalizes a communicative act. The leaf nodes of the
text structure indicate speech acts with associated
rhetorical propositions, rhetorical predicates instantiated
with propositional content from the event/state structure.
In Figure 3, the event sequence is introduced by
describing the mission package which initiated the
previous run of the simulation (#&lt;air-strike-10&gt;) by
informing the hearer of its logical definition (i.e.,
superclass and distinguishing features) and then by
indicating its constituents or components. Next events
are narrated in topical groups, each of which is temporally
sequenced. The text plan is linearized and each speech act
with its rhetorical proposition is linguistically realized
using a unification-based surface generator [Maybury,
1989]. The final surface form of the text structure in
Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4. The surface generator
includes an orthographic layout module that examines the
text structure and begins a new paragraph when a new
discourse segment begins (e.g., before the introduction and
after each topical narration sequence).
While the plan operators guide the ordering of
propositional content (and thus focus shifts), global
registers for DF, TF, and SF are updated by examining the
propositional content selected by the text planner. These
registers are used by the surface generator to guide surface
choice. For example, a noun phrase is pronominalized if
it is given (versus new) and was the previous current DF.
And by examining the relationship of speaker time (S),
event time (E), and reference time (R based on TF), the
realization component is able to choose appropriate verb
tense (e.g., if E=R&lt;S then use simple past). Similarly,
the realization of temporal adverbs, which help to convey
temporal relations among events, (e.g., &amp;quot;and then&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;three
minutes later&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;simultaneously&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;after&amp;quot;) is
guided by the relationship of past to current TF. For
example if the time of the current TF equals that of the
past TF then connectives such as &amp;quot;simultaneously&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;at
the same time&amp;quot; introduce utterances. Both temporal and
spatial adverbs (exemplified in the next section) often refer
anaphorically to the current TF (e.g., &amp;quot;ten minutes later&amp;quot;)
or SF (e.g., &amp;quot;three miles away&amp;quot;). During realization,
events that are of the same class, occur at the same time
and share a semantic patient are combined as in &amp;quot;One
minute later Erfurt-A and Erfurt-D simultaneously fired a
missile at offensive counter air mission 102.&amp;quot; The adverb
&amp;quot;again&amp;quot; is used when an event has already occurred, and
thus functions as an anaphor.
Other classes of adverbs can also enrich the event
description. These include adverbs regarding manner (e.g.,
&amp;quot;deftly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sadly&amp;quot;), rate (e.g., &amp;quot;slowly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rapidly&amp;quot;), duration
(e.g., &amp;quot;for twenty minutes&amp;quot;), frequency (&amp;quot;every ten
minutes&amp;quot;), and numeration (e.g., &amp;quot;seventeen times&amp;quot;).
Some adverbs (e.g., manner, rate, durative, locative) regard
internal properties of the event whereas others relate the
current event to other events and therefore are external
such as temporal adverbs (e.g., &amp;quot;simultaneously&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;yesterday&amp;quot;) or &amp;quot;anaphoric&amp;quot; adverbs (e.g., &amp;quot;again&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;as
before&amp;quot;). The relationship of these and other classes of
adverbials to DF, TF, and SF remains an interesting area
for further work.

Air-strike 10 was an attack against Dresden airfield in the Fulda-Gap region of West Germany on
Tuesday December 2, 1987. Air-strike 10 included three Offensive Counter Air Missions (OCA100,
OCA101, and OCA102), one SAM Suppression Mission (55M444), one Transportation Mission (TRANS100), and
one air refueling mission (RFL100).
Offensive Counter Air Mission 100 began mission execution at 8:20::0 Tuesday December 2, 1987.
902TFW-F-16c dispensed four aircraft for Offensive Counter Air Mission 100. Eight minutes later
Offensive Counter Air Mission 100 began flying its ingress route. Three minutes later Allstedt-B and
Allstedt-C simultaneously fired a missile at Offensive Counter Air Mission 100. And fifty-nine
seconds later Offensive Counter Air Mission 100 was ordered to abort its mission. One second later
Allstedt-C and Allstedt-B again simultaneously fired a missile at Offensive Counter Air Mission 100.
Two minutes later Allstedt-B again fired a missile at Offensive Counter Air Mission 100. Then one
minute later Erfurt-A fired a missile at Offensive Counter Air Mission 100. Then two minutes later
llama-B fired a missile at Offensive Counter Air Mission 100. Seven minutes later Offensive Counter
Air Mission 100 ended its mission. It generated its post-mission report.
In the meantime SAM Suppression Mission 444 began mission execution at 8:30::0 Tuesday December 2,
1987. 126TFW-F-4g dispensed one aircraft for SAM Suppression Mission 444. SAM Suppression Mission
444 began flying its ingress route. Thirteen minutes later Mobile-SAM1 fired a missile at SAM

Mission 444.
In the meantime Offensive Counter Air Mission 101 began mission execution at 8:41::40 Tuesday
December 2, 1987. 900TFW-F-4c dispensed four aircraft for Offensive Counter Air Mission 101. Then
seven minutes later Offensive Counter Air Mission 101 began flying its ingress route. Then ten
minutes later it bombed its target. It began flying its egress route. Thirty-Six minutes later it
ended its mission. It generated its post-mission report.

Locative Instructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990294731707317">
While space limitations prohibit a full explication of
spatial plan operators, a short indicative example is
provided. TEXPLAN produces locative instructions, that
is directions that enable an agent to get from point a to
point b, in the context of the Map Display System
(Hilton, 1987; Hilton and Anken, 1990), a cartographic
database underlying LACE which includes thousands of
entities such as roads, bridges, airports and so on. For
example if the user asks how to get from Mannheim to
Heidelberg, the underlying application plans a route which
TEXPLAN organizes and presents as:
From Mannheim take Route 38 Southeast for
four kilometers to the intersection of
Route 38 and Autobahn A5. From the
intersection of Route 38 and Autobahn A5
take Autobahn A5 Southeast for seven
kilometers to Heidelberg. Heidelberg is
located in block 32umv7070 at 49.390
latitude and 6.68° longitude, 4 kilometers
Northwest of Dossenheim, six kilometers
Northwest of Edingen, and five kilometers
Southwest of Eppelheim.
The structure of the text follows the spatial progression of
the route. TEXPLAN tracks the spatial focus (each
segment of the route) as the planner sequentially informs
the user of each segment. This information is then used
to guide the realization of locative adverbials and
prepositions. For example, directionals such as
&amp;quot;Southeast&amp;quot; and distances such as &amp;quot;for four kilometers&amp;quot; are
computed by examining the focus of the current
proposition with respect to the previous spatial focus.
Finally, constraints on the realization of deictic
anaphora (e.g., selecting &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;
versus &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;) can be related to SF, analogous to the use
of DF to guide pronominalization. One view is to base
deictic anaphora on the relation of the speaker&apos;s physical
location to that of specficand (e.g., &amp;quot;I am here, you are
there&amp;quot;). However, choice sometimes seems to be based on
the relation of the specificand to the SF (e.g., substituting
&amp;quot;here&amp;quot; in the second utterance of the above route plan).
This is an issue of current investigation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999964476190476">
Despite the advantages of topical and temporal order in the
LACE report, it remains simply a recounting of salient
events. Even though it has a setting, it is not a story
because it fails to explicitly indicate causal relations
among events and states. Current research is focusing on
analyzing the causal structure of short stories in an
attempt to develop a theory of story structure/plot and its
relationship to the event/state ontology (i.e., issues of
motivation, enablement, causation, effect, and purpose, as
well as spatiality and temporality).
Another area for research is the explicit representation
of narrative techniques (e.g., suspense, surprise, mystery)
as text plans. Because the text plans explicitly indicate
what cognitive/psychological effect their application has
on the hearer, they should be readily extensible to account
for (simple) narrative techniques. Finally, more research
needs to be done to investigate the various linguistic
aspects of temporal and spatial adverbials and their relation
to the event/state structure and text planning. In
particular, temporal and spatial shift rules require more
detailed examination.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987818181818">
This paper indicates how discourse focus, temporal focus,
and a new notion of spatial focus can be used by a text
planner to select and order content. In addition, the paper
discusses how discourse, temporal, and spatial focus
caches can be used to guide surface choices (e.g.,
pronominalization, the generation of tense and aspect, and
the production of temporal and spatial adverbials). The
use of these focal models in conjunction with narrative
text plans allows the system to generate multiparagraph
reports about the activities of a knowledge based simulator
as well as locative instructions from a route planner.
