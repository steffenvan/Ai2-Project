Languages with complex morphologies present difficulties for dictionaries users. One solution to this
problem is to use a morphological parser for lookup of morphologically complex words, including fully
inflected words, without the user needing to explicitly know the morphology. We discuss the sorts of
morphologies which cause the greatest need for such an interface.

<bodyText confidence="0.999778516129032">
When it comes to dictionaries, not all languages
are created equal. Quite apart from the fact that
more effort has been put into lexicography for
some languages than for others, languages vary in
how they lend themselves to word look up.
Generations of English-speaking students have
been told, when they were uncertain how to spell a
word, to look it up in the dictionary. How one is
supposed to look up a word when one does not
already know how to spell it has been the source of
much distress for those same students.
For English, the chief obstacle to dictionary
lookup is the orthography.1 But for other
languages, the structure of the language itself is the
problem, and in particular the languages
morphology. Unless the dictionary user is
explicitly familiar with that morphology,
determining the citation form of a given word can
be quite difficult.
One solution, at least for electronic dictionaries,
is to create an interface that uses a morphological
parser to find the root or stem of the full word
provided by the user, and then automatically look
up that form (or its citation form), thereby shifting
the need to explicitly know the morphology (and
the choice of citation form) from the user to the
computer. Such interfaces are described in Breidt
and Feldweg 1997, Prószéky and Kis 2002,
Streiter, Knapp, Voltmer et al. 2004, etc.

trivial task, and a simpler solution where

2 Morphology and Citation Forms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886653846154">
We need to clarify here that we are concerned
with how difficult dictionary lookup is for
average users, that is, for users who may not be
overtly familiar with the morphology of the
language. Linguists and (usually) language
teachers are often familiar enough with the
morphology that they can compute the citation
form from any arbitrary inflected form, but many
other users will not be able to do so.
Certain kinds of morphology can make it
difficult for average users to find the citation form
of an inflected word. Usually this is inflectional
morphology, simply because forms related by
derivational morphology are often given separate
listings. However, some languages have productive
and regular derivational morphology, so that forms
related by derivational affixation may not in fact be
listed. Furthermore, in some languages (such as
Athabaskan languages, see below) the derivational
and inflectional morphology interact so as to make
finding a citation form especially difficult. Finally,
the boundary between inflectional and derivational
morphology is not always clear whether to a
linguist or to the end user.
We now turn to the specifics of how morphology
can impede dictionary lookup. For languages with
any degree of morphology, one form of the
paradigm for a given part of speech is usually
chosen as the citation form. Problems may arise for
words which lack the chosen form (e.g. pluralia
tantum words, such as scissors). In any case, users
must generally be told what form to look for.
Of course, for languages with only a small
amount of productive morphology, it does not take
much sophistication to come up with a citation
form from an inflected form. For English, the
citation form of an inflected verb is generally
found by stripping off one of a handful of suffixes
(and sometimes undoing other spelling rules).
Irregular verbs present complications, but their
frequency makes them unlikely candidates for
lookup, except by language learners. At any rate,
irregular words can be placed in minor entries,
separately alphabetized from the major entries, and
cross-referencing the latter.
In practice, users may not even need to know
how to remove the suffixes, since when searching
for walks or walking they will find walk, and
generally make the connection.
If a language is exclusively suffixing, not even a
large amount of inflectional affixation need stand
in the way of lookup. If the user cannot figure out
the citation form of a word, he can simply look up
the first few letters to find the entry. Thus, even
languages like Turkish or Quechua often pose little
problem for lookup. (Nevertheless, for some users,
it may not be obvious that the citation form thus
found corresponds to the inflected word, see e.g.
Corris, Manning, Poetsch et al. 2004: 47.)
More problematic for lookup is prefixation.2
Since dictionary words are usually alphabetized
from the beginning of the word to the end (left to
right in most writing systems), in theory the user
would have to strip prefixes before doing lookup.
An obvious work-around would be to alphabetize
words in (exclusively) prefixing languages from
right to left. Alternatively, the dictionary could
provide an index alphabetized from right to left,
where the user could find the citation form, then
look up that form in the main part of the
dictionary. To our knowledge, this solution has not
been employed, although this may be due to the
paucity of exclusively prefixing languages.
The reverse alphabetization solution would not
work for languages which employ both prefixing
and suffixing, such as Tzeltal (Mayan). But even
here the situation is not too bad if the number of
prefixes is small, as in fact it is in Tzeltal: the
common prefixes are h-/k-, a-/aw-, and s-/y-, and
stripping these probably does not present much of
a problem to most users of the Vocabulario tzeltal
de Bachajon (Slocum and Gerdel 1965).
The real problem for languages having both
prefixes and suffixes arises when the language has
a large number of prefixes, or when the language
productively employs compounding or incorpor-
ation, which can have the same effect for
dictionary lookup as productive prefixation.
2 If the citation form is prefixed, this may also cause
problems for alphabetization, since many words may
fall into the same section of the alphabet. This problem
is well-known, but is not the focus of our discussion.
German is a notorious example of the difficulties
occasioned by compounding, and Nahuatl is an
example of a language having incorporation.
In Nahuatl, indefinite direct objects can often be
incorporated into the verb: chi:lkwa to eat chili is
composed of the verb stem kwa to eat , preceded
by the incorporated noun chi:l chili . The naïve
user may succeed in finding the incorporated noun
in a printed dictionary, but may be at a loss to
decipher the rest of the word, since kwa is not a
noun suffix in Nahuatl.3
A greater difficulty for the average dictionary
user is nonconcatenative morphology, such as
infixes, partial reduplication, and templatic
morphology. In Tagalog, for example, there is an
affix -um- marking actor focus, which is infixed
following a word-initial consonant (Schachter and
Otanes 1972). Furthermore, the Tagalog
imperfective aspect is indicated by partial re-
duplication. Thus the word bumibili is a form of
the verb root bili to buy , where the reduplication
is bi-, and the infix -um- is stuck into the middle of
this reduplicated syllable.
In some cases, the user can (or should!) be
expected to understand this and deal with
converting bumibili, say, to the appropriate citation
form. And in fact dictionary writers often assist by
providing partly inflected forms: in the case of
Tagalog, for instance, citation forms generally
include the focus affixes. But as the complexity of
the morphology increases, relying on the user to
guess the citation form from an inflected form
becomes less of an option. At the same time,
explicitly including multiple inflected forms in the
dictionary becomes cumbersome, even impossible.
In the following subsections, we detail
difficulties occasioned by the particular morpho-
logies of Semitic and Athabaskan languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979181">
2.1 Semitic Languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999220083333333">
Arabic, like most other Semitic languages,
employs templatic morphology, in which affixes
composed of vowels can be interdigitated between
consonants of the root. Affixation can also modify
the root consonants, frequently by gemination. For
example, a typical Arabic root ktb can appear in
inflected forms as diverse as katab, kattab, ktatab,
ktanbab, and kutib (Spencer 1991). Some of this
morphology is derivational, and some inflectional,
but it all poses a problem for users.
Moreover, Arabic is ordinarily written without
many of the vowels. While this may ease the

3 In practice, this problem in Nahuatl is ameliorated
by the fact that incorporation is not highly productive.
Therefore the most common cases of incorporation
should arguably be listed in the dictionary.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971921052632">
problem caused by the interdigitated vowels, it
means that the dictionary user may have more
difficulty distinguishing root consonants from
affixal consonants, since the vowels are not present
in the written form to help parse the word.
Traditional Arabic dictionaries have been root
based; that is, the head word of a lexical entry is
the root, with all derivational and inflectional
morphology removed. Listed derived forms appear
as subentries under a given root (and inflected
forms which must be listed are generally included
as variant forms within the subentry for a given
derived form). Because of the difficulty undoing
Arabic derivational and inflectional morphology
poses for the average user, so-called alphabetic
dictionaries have become increasingly popular. In
an alphabetic dictionary, derived forms serve as
headwords, so that alphabetization is done over the
entire set of lexemes, whether root or stem.
Root-based dictionaries and alphabetic diction-
aries each have strengths and weaknesses. A root-
based dictionary gathers the information on related
forms into one place, rather than scattering it
throughout the dictionary, as is the case for an
alphabetic dictionary. On the other hand, a root-
based dictionary requires a much more explicit
understanding of Arabic morphology than many
users possess. Even so, finding the citation form of
an irregular plural or an irregular verb in an
alphabetic dictionary can be a daunting task.
In summary, Arabic morphology forces the
dictionary writer to choose between a root-based
format and an alphabetic format; both approaches
have their disadvantages. Similar problems obtain
for other languages with templatic morphologies.
Fortunately, these problems can be overcome by
interposing a morphological parser between the
user and the electronic dictionary.

2.2 Athabaskan Languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997737287037038">
The difficulties that Athabaskan languages pose
for dictionary lookup have been detailed in Poser
2002; here we give an outline of the problem for
one such language, Carrier.
Like other Athabaskan languages, Carrier is
predominantly prefixing, with verbs carrying
numerous prefixes. Each verb can have tens or
even hundreds of thousands of forms. But the sheer
number of verb forms is not all that different from
other agglutinative languages such as Finnish or
Turkish. The real problem is that Carrier prefixes
are a mixture of inflectional and derivational
morphemes, with the derivational affixes often
appearing outside of inflectional affixes.
Furthermore, it is not infrequently the case that
there are prefixes which obligatorily combine with
a root in a certain meaning. In effect, Athabaskan
languages have discontinuous verb stems.4 For
instance, the Carrier verb to be red consists of
the root k&apos;un with the valence prefix l-
immediately preceding the root and the prefix d-
several positions to the left, giving forms like:
dilk&apos;un you (sg.) are red
duzk&apos;un I am red
hudulk&apos;un they are red
hudutilk&apos;un they will be red
Note that some subject markers follow the d-
while others precede it. Also notice that the
allomorphy sometimes collapses two affixes into a
single segment (s+l z in duzk&apos;un).
For dictionaries, the implication is that there is in
general no contiguous or invariant portion of the
verb that can serve as the citation form. The
morphology is primarily prefixal, but the existence
of extensive stem variation and some suffixation
means that the stem is not a good citation form,
and that ordering forms form right-to-left will not
keep related forms close together. Worse, the
phonological material that contributes the basic
meaning of the word is not, in general, contiguous.
This means that any citation form will not be easily
extracted by an unsophisticated user. Moreover,
no simple sorting will keep related forms together.
Worse, many verb roots are highly abstract, so
that a form can only be given an English
translation on the basis of the root together with
one or more prefixes. Examples are found in the
classificatory verbs. For example, the verb root
meaning to give takes distinct derivational
affixes depending on the type of object being
handled: ball-shaped objects, names, houses, non-
count objects, long rigid objects, contents of open
containers, liquids, fluffy stuff and these
classifiers may not be adjacent to the root.
In light of the difficult of dictionary lookup in
Athabaskan languages, one approach has been to
list, for each verb, a single form, as in the major
dictionary of Navajo (Young and William Morgan
1987). However, this requires the user to be able to
analyze a verb form and convert it to the citation
form. This is a non-trivial task even for fluent
native speakers; it is difficult or impossible for
language learners. Indeed, the problem of
dictionary use for Navajo is so acute that the Diné
(Navajo) College has instituted a one semester
course Navajo Grammar and Applied
Linguistics , which is largely devoted to teaching
4 These are somewhat analogous to English verb-
particle combinations such as bring a matter up , in
which the verbal inflection (and often a direct object)
intervenes between the verb root and the particle. But
the intervening inflectional morphology in Athabaskan
is vastly more complex than that of English.
college-level native speakers of Navajo how to use
the dictionary of their own language.
The other major approach to dictionary making
in Athabaskan languages is to list individual
morphemes. In order to use such a dictionary, the
user must be able to analyze the word into root and
affixes. But the root may have many shapes. For
example, the root meaning to go around in a boat
takes forms such as , , , , , and .
Although there is a pattern to these changes, it is
complex if not irregular. The resulting difficulty
for dictionary lookup should be obvious.
A root-based lexicon has been published for
Navajo (Young, Morgan and Midgette 1992). It
has the virtue of being comprehensive, and of
avoiding duplication. For example, the detailed
meaning of a verb root can be explained only once,
in the entry for that root, rather than in each of
many entries for forms derived from that root.
The problem with this approach is that it requires
even more grammatical knowledge on the part of
the user than traditional Athabaskan dictionaries,
together with an understanding of an elaborate
process for analyzing forms, looking up their
components, and constructing the meaning of the
form from its components. As a result, while
analytic dictionaries are useful for linguists, but
most people, including both language learners and
native speakers, find them very difficult.
In sum, the morphological structure of
Athabaskan languages forces difficult choices on
the dictionary writer, and results in a steep learning
curve for the user. Again, this is the sort of
language structure where a morphological interface
can make a crucial difference.

3 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972045454546">
We have outlined ways in which the structure of
languages can make a morphological parser as a
front end for dictionary lookup attractive.
There are more uses to such technology than just
dictionary lookup. If the morphology engine is a
transducer, it can be used for generation as well as
for parsing. Such a bidirectional engine can be
used to generate the paradigm of any stem. While
this is of little interest to native speakers, it may be
of great assistance to language learners.
Another application would be to provide what
amounts to a virtual interlinear text with
morpheme glosses for any text in electronic form.
To be sure, this text would not be disambiguated,
unless a knowledgeable user put forth the effort, or
unless an automatic disambiguator (tagger) was
provided. Nevertheless, interlinear text, even in an
ambiguous form, could be a useful for linguists
and perhaps language learners.
In sum, a morphological transducer connected to
an electronic dictionary can provide valuable aid
for both native speakers and language learners.

In Tagalog, for example, there is an affix -um- marking actor focus, which is infixed following a word-initial consonant (Schachter and Otanes 1972). Furthermore, the Tagalog imperfective aspect is indicated by partial reduplication. Thus the word bumibili is a form of the verb root bili to buy , where the reduplication is bi-, and the infix -um- is stuck into the middle of this reduplicated syllable. In some cases, the user can (or should!) be expected to understand this and deal with converting bumibili, say, to the appropriate citation form. And in fact dictionary writers often assist by providing partly inflected forms: in the case of Tagalog, for instance, citation forms generally include the focus affixes.

To our knowledge, this solution has not been employed, although this may be due to the paucity of exclusively prefixing languages. The reverse alphabetization solution would not work for languages which employ both prefixing and suffixing, such as Tzeltal (Mayan). But even here the situation is not too bad if the number of prefixes is small, as in fact it is in Tzeltal: the common prefixes are h-/k-, a-/aw-, and s-/y-, and stripping these probably does not present much of a problem to most users of the Vocabulario tzeltal de Bachajon (Slocum and Gerdel 1965). The real problem for languages having both prefixes and suffixes arises when the language has a large number of prefixes, or when the language productively employs compounding or incorporation, which can have the same effect for dictionary lookup as productive prefixation. 2 If the citation form is prefixed, this may also cause problems for alphabetization, since many words may fall into the same section of the alphabet. This problem is well-known, but is not the focus of our discussion. German is a notorious example of the difficulties occasioned by compounding, and Nahuatl is an example of</context>

In the following subsections, we detail difficulties occasioned by the particular morphologies of Semitic and Athabaskan languages. 2.1 Semitic Languages Arabic, like most other Semitic languages, employs templatic morphology, in which affixes composed of vowels can be interdigitated between consonants of the root. Affixation can also modify the root consonants, frequently by gemination. For example, a typical Arabic root ktb can appear in inflected forms as diverse as katab, kattab, ktatab, ktanbab, and kutib (Spencer 1991). Some of this morphology is derivational, and some inflectional, but it all poses a problem for users. Moreover, Arabic is ordinarily written without many of the vowels. While this may ease the 3 In practice, this problem in Nahuatl is ameliorated by the fact that incorporation is not highly productive. Therefore the most common cases of incorporation should arguably be listed in the dictionary. problem caused by the interdigitated vowels, it means that the dictionary user may have more difficulty distinguishing root consonants from affixal consonants, since the vowels are not present in the </context>
