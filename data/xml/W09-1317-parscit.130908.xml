Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999800045454545">
An important task in information retrieval is to
identify sentences that contain important relation-
ships between key concepts. In this work, we
propose a novel approach to automatically extract
sentence patterns that contain interactions involv-
ing concepts of molecular biology. A pattern is
defined in this work as a sequence of specialized
Part-of-Speech (POS) tags that capture the struc-
ture of key sentences in the scientific literature.
Each candidate sentence for the classification task
is encoded as a POS array and then aligned to
a collection of pre-extracted patterns. The qual-
ity of the alignment is expressed as a pairwise
alignment score. The most innovative component
of this work is the use of a Genetic Algorithm
(GA) to maximize the classification performance
of the alignment scoring scheme. The system
achieves an F-score of 0.834 in identifying sen-
tences which describe interactions between bio-
logical entities. This performance is mostly af-
fected by the quality of the preprocessing steps
such as term identification and POS tagging.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954538461539">
Recent research in information extraction (IE) in bio-
logical science has focused on extracting information
about interactions between biological entities from re-
search communications. The type of interaction of in-
terest includes protein-protein, protein-DNA, gene reg-
ulations and other interactions between macromole-
cules. This work broadens the definition of the term
“interaction” to include other types of concepts that
are semantically related to cellular components and
processes. This contrasts with the past efforts focus-
ing strictly on molecular interactions (Blaschke et al.,
1999; Ono et al., 2001). We anticipate that identifying
the relationships between concepts of molecular biol-
ogy will facilitate the building of knowledge models,
improve the sensitivity of IE tasks and ultimately facil-
itate the formulation of new hypothesis by experimen-
talists.
The extraction of interactions is based on the heuris-
tic premise that interacting concepts co-occur within
a given section of text. The challenge is that co-
occurrence certainly does not guarantee that a passage
contains an interaction(Jang et al., 2006; Skusa et al.,
2005). Co-occurrence is highly dependent on the de-
finition of the section of text within which the target
terms are expected to be found. A thorough compari-
son on the prediction of protein-protein interaction be-
tween abstract-level co-occurrence and sentence-level
co-occurrence was undertaken (Raychaudhuri, 2006).
It is demonstrated that abstract co-occurrence is more
sensitive but less specific for interactions. At the cost
of wide coverage, sentence co-occurrence increases the
accuracy of interaction prediction. Since the ultimate
goal of IE is to extract knowledge and accuracy is the
most important aspect in evaluating the performance
of such systems, it makes sense to focus the effort
in seeking interaction sentences rather than passages
or abstracts. Not every co-occurrence in sentences
implies a relationship that expresses a fact. In the
2005 Genomics Track dataset, 50% of all sentence co-
occurrences of entities correspond to definite relation-
ships while the rest of the co-occurrences only convey
some possible relationships or contain no relationship
of interest (Li et al., 2005). Therefore, more sophisti-
cated text mining strategies are required to classify sen-
tences that describe interactions between co-occurring
concepts.
In the BioCreative II challenge 1, teams were asked
to determine whether a given passage of text contained
information about the interaction between two proteins.
This classification task worked at the abstract level and
the interacting protein pairs were not required to be ex-
tracted. The task for the Learning Language in Logic

processes. Examples of biological processes as entities
are: “T cell activation” and “IL-2 gene transcription”.
We consider that a broader definition of biological term
will include more facts from literature, thus leading to
more general use of interaction patterns for IE tasks.
ABTA considers the longest expression and ignores
embedded entities. Further, instead of distinguishing
terms from their relevant biology concepts, a unified
tag “BIO” is assigned to all the identified terms. We
aim to discover patterns of the general interactions be-
tween biological concepts, not only the interactions be-
tween molecules, e.g., protein-protein interaction.
Tags like NN(noun) and VB(verb) are typically used
to define entities and the action type of interactions,
and thus they are indispensable. However, tags such
as JJ(adjective) and RB(adverb) could occur at differ-
ent positions in a sentence. We decided to remove these
tags to prevent the combinatorial effect that these would
induce within the set of extracted patterns.
4.4 Text chunking
Next, a rule-based text chunker (Ramshaw and Mar-
cus, 1995) is applied on the tagged sentences to fur-
ther identify phrasal units, such as base noun phrases
NP and verbal units VB. This allows us to focus on the
holistic structure of each sentence. Text chunking is not
applied on the identified biological terms. In order to
achieve more generalized interaction patterns, a unified
tag “VB” is used to represent every verbal unit instead
of employing different tags for various tenses of verbs.
As a result of preprocessing, every sentence is rep-
resented by its generalized form as a sequence of cor-
responding tags consisting of POS tags and predefined
tags. Table 1 summarizes the main tags in the system.
A biological interaction tends to involve at least three
objects: a pair of co-occurring biological entities con-
nected by a verb which specifies the action type of the
interaction. Thus, a constraint is applied that only sen-
tences satisfying form “BioEntity A – Verb – BioEn-
tity B” will be preserved as candidate sentences to be
further processed in the system. It is possible that the
presence of two entities in different sentence structures
implies a relationship. However, this work assumes the
underlying co-occurrence of two concepts and a verb in
the interest of improving the classification accuracy.
The obtained candidate sentences are split into train-
ing and testing sets. The training set is used to ex-
tract the representative patterns of biological interac-
tions. The testing set is prepared for identifying sen-
tences that evidently describe biological interactions.
5 Interaction pattern extraction
5.1 PATRICIA trees
The method we propose to extract interaction patterns
from candidate sentences is based on the use of PATRI-
CIA trees (Morrison, 1968). A PATRICIA tree uses
path compression by grouping common sequences into
nodes. This structure provides an efficient way of stor-
ing values while maintaining the lookup time for a key
of O(N). It has been applied to many large information
retrieval problems (Chien, 1997; Chen et al., 1998).
In our work, a PATRICIA tree is used for the first
time to facilitate the automatic extraction of interaction
patterns. All training sentences are inserted and stored
in a generic PATRICIA tree from which the common
patterns of POS tags can be efficiently stored and the
tree structure used to compute relevant usage statistics.
5.2 Potential pattern extraction
Patterns of straightforward biological interactions are
frequently encountered in a range of actual sentences.
Conversely, vague relationships or complex interac-
tions patterns are seldom repeated. Therefore, the

patterns. As a result, each sentence is assigned to its
most appropriate pattern along with a maximum align-
ment score. Therefore, an interaction sentence will be
highlighted with a high alignment score by its most
similar interaction pattern, while a non-interaction sen-
tence will be characterized by a low alignment score
indicating rejections by all patterns. Essentially, this
procedure can be seen as a variation of the well-known
k Nearest Neighbors classification method, with k = 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989195652174">
We then evaluate whether the alignment scores can be
used to classify the testing sentences. We have pro-
posed two independent evaluation measures: statistical
analysis (SA) and classification accuracy (AC).
SA measures whether the scoring difference be-
tween the mean of interaction sentences and the mean
of non-interaction sentences is statistically significant.
If the difference is significant, there will be a tendency
that interaction sentences outscore non-interaction sen-
tences in alignment. Hence, it would be reliable to
use alignment scores to classify testing sentences. Al-
though non-interaction sentences could come from the
same documents as interaction sentences and discuss
concepts that are associated with the target interac-
tions, we assume that interaction sentences and non-
interaction sentences are two independent samples.
The statistical two-sample z test (Freund and Per-
les, 2006) is performed with the null hypothesis that
there is no scoring difference between the means of
interaction and non-interaction sentences. A compar-
atively large z will lead to the rejection of the null
hypothesis. Naturally, the increase of z value will in-
crease the difference between the means and therefore
conceptually keep pushing the overall scoring distrib-
utions of two samples further away from each other.
Consequently, interaction sentences can be separated
from non-interaction sentences according to alignment
scores. In reality, the distinction between interaction
and non-interaction sentences is not absolute. Thus,
the scoring distributions of two samples can only be
distanced by a certain maximum value of z depending
on the scoring scheme applied in pattern matching.
Conversely, AC measures the proportion of correctly
classified testing sentences, including both interaction
and non-interaction sentences, to the total testing sen-
tences. An appropriate threshold T is determined for
obtained alignment scores to differentiate between in-
teraction and non-interaction sentences, and to facili-
tate the calculation of classification accuracy.
It is not possible to evaluate the performance without
correctly pre-labeled testing sentences. We decided to
manually classify the testing sentences in advance by
assigning each sentence an appropriate label of inter-
action or non-interaction. This work was done by two
independent experts, both with Ph.D. degrees in mole-
cular biology or a related discipline.

6.3 Scoring scheme optimization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933137931034">
The scoring scheme applied in pattern matching has a
crucial impact on the performance of interaction sen-
tence identification. An interesting problem is whether
there exists an optimal scoring scheme covering the
costs of gap, match and mismatch for different sys-
tem tags in the pattern matching alignment, which is
destined to achieve the best performance on classify-
ing testing sentences. To the best of our knowledge,
no efforts have been made to investigate this problem.
Instead, an empirical or arbitrary scoring scheme was
adopted in previous research for the pairwise align-
ments (Huang et al., 2004; Hakenberg et al., 2005). We
have proved that the problem is NP-hard by reducing a
well-known NP-hard problem 3-SAT to this problem.
The proof is not presented in this work.
A genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a heuristic
method to optimize parameters of the scoring scheme
for sentence classification. The costs of penalties and
rewards for different system tags are encoded by inte-
ger values within two predefined ranges: [-50, 0) and
(0, 50], and assembled as a potential solution of scor-
ing scheme, which consists of 30 parameters covering
the costs for tags in the alignment as listed in Table 2.
The two evaluation measures SA and AC are used as
the fitness function for GA respectively with the goal
of maximizing z value or classification accuracy.
GA is set up to evolve for 100 generations, each of
which consists of a population of 100 potential solu-
tions of scoring scheme. GA starts with a randomly

with consideration of the runtime cost of evaluating the
fitness function, which requires running the scoring al-
gorithm with each sentence. A large number of gener-
ations or a large population size would incur an expen-
sive runtime cost of evaluation.
In addition, we further divide the labeled set of can-
didate sentences into two subsets: The first dataset is
used to optimize parameters of the scoring scheme,
while the second dataset, testing set, is used to test the
achieved scheme on the task of sentence classification.
7 Results and evaluation
7.1 Dataset
Our experiments have been conducted on Genia cor-
pus (v3.02) 4, the largest, publicly available corpus in
molecular biology domain. It consists of 2,000 biolog-
ical research paper abstracts and is intended to cover
biological reactions concerning transcription factors in
human blood cells. The information of sentence seg-
mentation, word tokenization, POS tagging and biolog-
ical term annotation is also encoded in the corpus.
7.2 Biological text preprocessing results
Evaluated using the inherently equipped annotation in-
formation, our system achieves nearly 99% accuracy
on segmenting sentences. Further, it obtains an overall
POS tagging accuracy of 91.0% on 364,208 individ-
ual words. We noticed that the tagging information en-
coded in Genia corpus is not always consistent through-
out the whole corpus, thus introducing detrimental ef-
fects on the tagging performance. Also, considering
that the tagger is parameterized according to the gen-
eral English domain, porting this tagger to the biology
domain is accompanied by some loss in performance.
The system reaches an F-score of 0.705 on annotat-
ing all biological terms including both multi-word and
single word terms. After performing text chunking, the
system produces a set of candidate sentences. We fur-
ther perform text chunking on Genia corpus based on
its encoded annotations and use the resulting set of sen-
tences for the subsequent experiments to provide a gold
standard to which results produced based on our system
annotations can be compared. Table 3 presents some
statistics of the preprocessed dataset. For each type of
annotations, we randomized the candidate sentence set

���� = 5 is used to filter out the potential patterns
that appear less than 5 times in the training set. Eval-
uated by domain experts, lists of 300 interaction verbs
and 700 non-interaction verbs are obtained from 12,525
training sentences with Genia annotations. Inflectional
variants of the verbs are also added into the lists.
Refined by the filtering rules and the interaction
verbs, a final set of representative patterns of biological
interactions are obtained from Algorithm 1. We per-
formed our proposed pattern learning method on train-
ing sentences of both the GENIA and our own anno-
tations. There are respectively 241 and 329 potential
patterns. Of these, 209 and 302 were extracted. Inter-
estingly, only 97 extracted patterns are common to both
annotation schemes.

We applied the evaluation measures, SA and AC,
respectively to the subset of 300 testing sentences as
the fitness function for GA, and recorded the scoring
scheme of every generation resulted from GA. Figure 1
presents the distribution of achieved classification ac-
curacy in terms of each scoring scheme optimized by
GA. This comparison is done with respect to the gener-
ation and evaluated on 300 testing sentences using the
annotations from the Genia corpus.
The achieved classification accuracy for AC gen-
erally outperforms the classification accuracy derived
by SA. It reaches its highest classification accuracy
80.33% from the 91th generation. Therefore, AC is
considered more efficient with the system and becomes
our final choice of fitness function for GA.

Table 6 shows that when using the Genia annota-
tions the system achieves an 0.834 F-score in identify-
ing interaction sentences and an overall AC of 80.33%,
which is much higher than the proportion of either in-
teraction or non-interaction sentences in the 300 sen-
tence subset. This indicates that the system performs
well on both classes. In 100 generations GA is not able
to evolve a scoring scheme that leads to an AC above
80.33%. Moreover, our system annotations achieve
a lower performance than Genia annotations. We at-
tribute the difference to the accuracy loss of our system
annotations in the preprocessing steps as inaccurate an-
notations will lead to inappropriate patterns, thus harm-
ing the performance of sentence identification. For Ge-
nia annotations, the performance on the 100 testing sen-
tences suggests an overfitting problem.
There are a number of preprocessing steps that affect
the final classification performance. However, even as-
suming an ideal preprocessing of the unstructured text,
our method relies on the assumption that all interac-
tion sentences are articulated by a set of POS patterns
that are distinct to all other types of sentences. The
manual annotation of the training/testing set was a dif-
ficult task, so it is reasonable to assume that this will
also be difficult for the classifier. The use of passive
voice and the common use of comma splicing within
patterns makes sentence-level classification an espe-
cially difficult task. Another source of interactions that
our system cannot identify are implied and assume a
deeper semantic understanding of the concepts them-

selves. Other sentences are long enough that the inter-
action itself is merely a secondary purpose to another
idea. All of these factors pose interesting challenges
for future development of this work.
Moreover, we also experimented with 10 empirical
scoring schemes derived from previous experiments on
the 300 sentences respectively, including the scheme in
the Table 2. Several fixed thresholds were attempted for
obtained alignment scores to differentiate between in-
teraction and non-interaction sentences. Without using
GA to optimize parameters of the scoring scheme, the
best performance of 10 empirical schemes is an overall
AC of 65.67%, which is outperformed at the 3rd gen-
eration of the GA optimization with Genia annotations.

Within the framework of our system, we further con-
ducted experiments on the same dataset for sentence
identification using interaction patterns generated by
another pattern generating algorithm (PGA) (Huang et
al., 2004) in order to compare with the performance of
patterns obtained by our pattern learning method.
In our implementation, PGA iterates over all pairs
of candidate sentences in the training set and calculates
the best alignment for each pair in terms of the cost
scheme of gap penalties proposed (Huang et al., 2004).
Each consensus sequence from the optimal alignment
of each pair forms a pattern. The filter rules proposed
are also applied. PGA has a time complexity of O(n2)
in the size of candidate sentences, n. Hence, our pro-
posed pattern learning method is much more efficient
when dealing with large collections of biological texts.
PGA produces a large number of patterns, even with
fmin = 5 and other filtering criteria. There are 37,319
common patterns between two types of annotations.

In this paper, a novel approach is presented to auto-
matically extract the representative patterns of biologi-
cal interactions, which are used to detect sentences that
describe biological interactions. We conducted the ex-
periments on our designed system based on the Ge-
nia corpus. By means of a genetic algorithm, the sys-
tem achieves an 0.834 F-score using Genia annotations
and an 0.731 F-score using our system annotations in
identifying interaction sentences by evaluating 300 sen-
tences. By applying the optimized scoring scheme to
another set of 100 sentences, the system achieves com-
parable results for both types of annotations. Further-
more, by comparing with another pattern generating al-
gorithm, we infer that our proposed method is more ef-
ficient in producing patterns to identify interaction sen-
tences.
In our future work, we would like to employ the ob-
tained interaction patterns to guide the extraction of
specific interactions. The matching between patterns
and sentences will be performed and the matched parts
of each sentence will be extracted as candidate interac-
tions. Further reasoning processes can be performed
by means of available biological ontologies, such as
UMLS Semantic Network (Mccray and Bodenreider,
2002) and Gene Ontology (Consortium, 2001), to in-
fer new relations from the initial interactions. Such
processes can be employed to derive additional biolog-
ical knowledge from existing knowledge, or test for bi-
ological consistency of the newly entered data.

<abstract confidence="0.998692565217391">An important task in information retrieval is to identify sentences that contain important relationships between key concepts. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically extract sentence patterns that contain interactions involving concepts of molecular biology. A pattern is defined in this work as a sequence of specialized Part-of-Speech (POS) tags that capture the structure of key sentences in the scientific literature. Each candidate sentence for the classification task is encoded as a POS array and then aligned to a collection of pre-extracted patterns. The quality of the alignment is expressed as a pairwise alignment score. The most innovative component of this work is the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to maximize the classification performance of the alignment scoring scheme. The system achieves an F-score of 0.834 in identifying sentences which describe interactions between biological entities. This performance is mostly affected by the quality of the preprocessing steps such as term identification and POS tagging.</abstract>

The type of interaction of interest includes protein-protein, protein-DNA, gene regulations and other interactions between macromolecules. This work broadens the definition of the term “interaction” to include other types of concepts that are semantically related to cellular components and processes. This contrasts with the past efforts focusing strictly on molecular interactions (Blaschke et al., 1999; Ono et al., 2001). We anticipate that identifying the relationships between concepts of molecular biology will facilitate the building of knowledge models, improve the sensitivity of IE tasks and ultimately facilitate the formulation of new hypothesis by experimentalists. The extraction of interactions is based on the heuristic premise that interacting concepts co-occur within a given section of text. The challenge is that cooccurrence certainly does not guarantee that a passage contains an interaction(Jang et al., 2006; Skusa et al., 2005). Co-occurrence is highly dependent on the definitio</context>

If the difference is significant, there will be a tendency that interaction sentences outscore non-interaction sentences in alignment. Hence, it would be reliable to use alignment scores to classify testing sentences. Although non-interaction sentences could come from the same documents as interaction sentences and discuss concepts that are associated with the target interactions, we assume that interaction sentences and noninteraction sentences are two independent samples. The statistical two-sample z test (Freund and Perles, 2006) is performed with the null hypothesis that there is no scoring difference between the means of interaction and non-interaction sentences. A comparatively large z will lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis. Naturally, the increase of z value will increase the difference between the means and therefore conceptually keep pushing the overall scoring distributions of two samples further away from each other. Consequently, interaction sentences can be separated from non-interaction sentences according to alignment scores. In reality, the distinction between interaction and non-interaction se</context>

Without using GA to optimize parameters of the scoring scheme, the best performance of 10 empirical schemes is an overall AC of 65.67%, which is outperformed at the 3rd generation of the GA optimization with Genia annotations. 7.5 System performance comparison Within the framework of our system, we further conducted experiments on the same dataset for sentence identification using interaction patterns generated by another pattern generating algorithm (PGA) (Huang et al., 2004) in order to compare with the performance of patterns obtained by our pattern learning method. In our implementation, PGA iterates over all pairs of candidate sentences in the training set and calculates the best alignment for each pair in terms of the cost scheme of gap penalties proposed (Huang et al., 2004). Each consensus sequence from the optimal alignment of each pair forms a pattern. The filter rules proposed are also applied. PGA has a time complexity of O(n2) in the size of candidate sentences, n. Hence, our proposed pattern learning method is much more efficient when dealing with lar</context>

We anticipate that identifying the relationships between concepts of molecular biology will facilitate the building of knowledge models, improve the sensitivity of IE tasks and ultimately facilitate the formulation of new hypothesis by experimentalists. The extraction of interactions is based on the heuristic premise that interacting concepts co-occur within a given section of text. The challenge is that cooccurrence certainly does not guarantee that a passage contains an interaction(Jang et al., 2006; Skusa et al., 2005). Co-occurrence is highly dependent on the definition of the section of text within which the target terms are expected to be found. A thorough comparison on the prediction of protein-protein interaction between abstract-level co-occurrence and sentence-level co-occurrence was undertaken (Raychaudhuri, 2006). It is demonstrated that abstract co-occurrence is more sensitive but less specific for interactions. At the cost of wide coverage, sentence co-occurrence increases the accuracy of interaction prediction. Since the ultimate goal of IE is to extract knowledge and accura</context>

Since the ultimate goal of IE is to extract knowledge and accuracy is the most important aspect in evaluating the performance of such systems, it makes sense to focus the effort in seeking interaction sentences rather than passages or abstracts. Not every co-occurrence in sentences implies a relationship that expresses a fact. In the 2005 Genomics Track dataset, 50% of all sentence cooccurrences of entities correspond to definite relationships while the rest of the co-occurrences only convey some possible relationships or contain no relationship of interest (Li et al., 2005). Therefore, more sophisticated text mining strategies are required to classify sentences that describe interactions between co-occurring concepts. In the BioCreative II challenge 1, teams were asked to determine whether a given passage of text contained information about the interaction between two proteins. This classification task worked at the abstract level and the interacting protein pairs were not required to be extracted.

However, this work assumes the underlying co-occurrence of two concepts and a verb in the interest of improving the classification accuracy. The obtained candidate sentences are split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to extract the representative patterns of biological interactions. The testing set is prepared for identifying sentences that evidently describe biological interactions. 5 Interaction pattern extraction 5.1 PATRICIA trees The method we propose to extract interaction patterns from candidate sentences is based on the use of PATRICIA trees (Morrison, 1968). A PATRICIA tree uses path compression by grouping common sequences into nodes. This structure provides an efficient way of storing values while maintaining the lookup time for a key of O(N). It has been applied to many large information retrieval problems (Chien, 1997; Chen et al., 1998). In our work, a PATRICIA tree is used for the first time to facilitate the automatic extraction of interaction patterns. All training sentences are inserted and stored in a generic PATRICIA tree from which the common patterns of POS tags can be efficiently stored and the tree structure used to compute releva</context>

We aim to discover patterns of the general interactions between biological concepts, not only the interactions between molecules, e.g., protein-protein interaction. Tags like NN(noun) and VB(verb) are typically used to define entities and the action type of interactions, and thus they are indispensable. However, tags such as JJ(adjective) and RB(adverb) could occur at different positions in a sentence. We decided to remove these tags to prevent the combinatorial effect that these would induce within the set of extracted patterns. 4.4 Text chunking Next, a rule-based text chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) is applied on the tagged sentences to further identify phrasal units, such as base noun phrases NP and verbal units VB. This allows us to focus on the holistic structure of each sentence. Text chunking is not applied on the identified biological terms. In order to achieve more generalized interaction patterns, a unified tag “VB” is used to represent every verbal unit instead of employing different tags for various tenses of verbs. As a result of preprocessing, every sentence is represented by its generalized form as a sequence of corresponding tags consisting of POS tags and predefined tags. </context>
