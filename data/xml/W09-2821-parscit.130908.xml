Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999626818181818">
We report on an attempt to extend a reference
generation system, originally designed only
for main subjects, to generate references for
multiple entities in a single document. This
endeavor yielded three separate systems: one
utilizing the original classifier, another with a
retrained classifier, and a third taking advan-
tage of new data to improve the identification
of interfering antecedents. Each subsequent
system improved upon the results of the pre-
vious iteration.

This paper provides a system report on our submis-
sion for the GREC-NEG (Named Entity Generation)
Task, one of the two shared task competitions for
Generation Challenges 2009. The objective is to se-
lect the most appropriate reference to named entities
from a given list of alternatives. The corpus consists
of introductory sections from approximately 1,000
Wikipedia articles in which single and plural refer-
ences to all people mentioned in the text have been
annotated (Belz and Varges, 2007). The training set
contains articles from the categories of Chefs, Com-
posers, and Inventors. GREC-NEG differs from the
other challenge task, GREC-MSR (Main Subject
References), in that systems must now account for
multiple entities rather than a single main subject,
and the corpus includes only articles about persons
rather than a variety of topics.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966181818182">
Our GREC-NEG systems build upon our work for
the GREC-MSR task. Our original approach was
to consult findings in psycholinguistic research for
guidance regarding appropriate feature selection for
the production of referring expressions. We relied
upon several common factors recognized by multi-
ple authors (Arnold, 1998; Gordon and Hendrick,
1998), including Subjecthood, Parallelism, Recency,
and Ambiguity. We followed (McCoy and Strube,
1999) who stressed the importance of Recency in
reference generation. Finally, we made a prelimi-
nary attempt at identifying potential interfering an-
tecedents that could affect the Ambiguity of pro-
nouns (Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004).
As an initial attempt (UDel-NEG-1), we simply
extended our GREC-MSR submission. By adapt-
ing our system to account for multiple entities and
the slightly different data format, we were able to
use the existing classifier to generate references for
GREC-NEG. We suspected that accuracy could be
improved by retraining the classifier, so our next sys-
tem (UDel-NEG-2) added entity and mention num-
bers as features to train on. Presumably, this could
help distinguish between the main subject and sec-
ondary entities, as well as plural references. As
all named entities are tagged in the GREC-NEG
corpus, we leveraged this information to improve
our recognition of other antecedents interfering with
pronoun usage in a third new system (UDel-NEG-
3). As in our GREC-MSR submission, all three of
our GREC-NEG systems trained C5.0 decision trees
(RuleQuest Research Pty Ltd, 2008) on our set of
features informed by psycholinguistic research.

for UDel-NEG-1 remained close to our GREC-MSR
submission, and error rate was reduced by over 20%
for UDel-NEG-2 and UDel-NEG-3. However, string
accuracy was very low across all three systems, as
compared to GREC-MSR results.
