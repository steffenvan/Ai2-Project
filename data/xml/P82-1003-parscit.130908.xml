<bodyText confidence="0.999720333333333">
Model-theoretic semantics provides a
computationally attractive means of representing
the semantics of natural language. However, the
models used in this formalism are static and are
usually infinite. Dynamic models are incomplete
models that include only the information needed for
an application and to which information can be
added. Dynamic models are basically approximations
of larger conventional models, but differ is
several interesting ways.
The difference discussed here is the
possibility of inconsistent information being
included in the model. If a computation causes the
model to expand, the result of that computation may
be different than the result of performing that
same computation with respect to the newly expanded
model (i.e. the result is inconsistent with the
information currently in the dynamic model).
Mechanisms are introduced to eliminate these local
(temporary) inconsistencies, but the most natural
mechanism can introduce permanent inconsistencies
in the information contained in the dynamic model.
These inconsistencies are similar to those that
people have in their knowledge and beliefs. The
mechanism presented is shown to be related to both
the intensional isomorphism and impossible worlds
approaches to this problem.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999523728571429">
In model-theoretic semantics, the semantics of
a sentence is represented with a logical formula,
and its meaning is the result of evaluating that
formula with respect to a logical model. The
model-theoretic semantics used here is that given
in The proper treatment of quantification in
ordinary English (PTQ) [Montague 1973], but the
problems and results discussed here apply to
similar systems and theories.
From the viewpoint of natural language
understanding, the conventional mod 1-theoretic
semantics used in descriptive theories has two
basic problems: (1) the information contained in a
mocLi is complete and unchanging whereas the
information possessed by a person listening to an
utterance is incomplete and may be changed by the
understanding of that utterance, and (2) the models
are usually presumed to be infinite, whereas a
person possesses only finite information. Dynamic
model-theoretic semantics [Friedman, Warren, and
Moran 1978, 1979; Moran 1980] addresses these
problems by allowing the models to contain
incomplete information and to have information
added to the model. A dynamic model is a &amp;quot;good
enough&amp;quot; approximation to an infinite model when it
contains the finite subset of information that is
needed to determine the meanings of the sentences
actually presented to the system.
Dynamic model-theoretic semantics allows the
evaluation of a formula to cause the addition of
information to the model. This interaction of the
evaluation of a formula and the expansion of the
model produces several linguistically interesting
side-effects, and these have been labelled
model-theoretic pragmatics [Moran 19b0].
One of these effects occurs when the
information given by an element of the model is
expanded between the time when that element is
identified as the denotation of a sub-expression in
the formula and the time when it is used in
combination with other elements. If the expansion
of the model is not properly managed, the result of
the evaluation of such a formula can be wrong
(i.e. inconsistent with the contents of the model).
Two mechanisms for maintaining the correctness of
the denotational relationship are presented. In
the first, the management of the relationship is
external to the model. This mechanism has the
disadvantage that it involves high overhead - the
denotational relationships must be repeatedly
verified, and unnecessary expansions of the model
may be performed. The second mechanism is similar
to the first, but eliminates much of this overhead:
it incorporates the management of the denotational
relationship into the model by augmenting the
model&apos;s structure.
It is this second mechanism that is of primary
interest. It was added to the system to eliminate
a source of immediate errors, but it was found to
introduce long-term &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot;. These errors are
interesting because they are the kinds of errors
that people frequently make. The structure added
to the model permits it to contain inconsistent
pieces of information (the structure of a
conventional model prevents this), and the
mechanism provides a motivated means for
controlling which inconsistencies may and may not
be entered into the dynamic model.
An important subclass of the inconsistencies
provided by this mechanism are known as intensional

substitution failure and this mechanism can be
viewed as a variant of both the &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; worlds
[e.g. Cresswell 1973: 39-41] and the intensional
isomorphism [e.g. Lewis 1972] approaches. Since
intensionality alone does not provide an account
for intensional substitution failure, this
mechanism provides an improved account of
propositional attitudes.
Finding the argument to which the A,-expression
is applied before evaluating the N-expression is
not a viable solution for two reasons. First, some
&apos;A-expressions are not applied to arguments, but
they have the same problem with their denotations
changing as the model expands. Second, having to
find the argument to which a 7\-expression is
applied eliminates one of the system&apos;s major
advantages, compositionality.

II. THE PROBLEM
III. THE FIRST MECHANISM - EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999347727272727">
Dynamic models contain incomplete information,
and the sets, relations, and functions in these
models can be incompletely specified (their domains
are usually incomplete). In PTQ, some phrases
translate to 7%-expressions; other A,-expressions are
used to combine and reorder subexpressions. The
possible denotations of these 7%-expressions are the
higher-order elements of the model (sets,
relations, and functions). For example, the proper
name &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; translates to the logical expression
(omitting intensionality for the time being):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.533348">
(1) [A P P(j)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993815333333333">
where P ranges over properties of individuals and
has as its denotation the set of properties that
John has. The sentence &amp;quot;John talks&amp;quot; translates to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908581">
(2) CA P P(j)](talk)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996034638888889">
This formula evaluates to true or false depending
on whether or not the property that is the
denotation of &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; is in the set of properties
that John has.
The dynamic model that is used to evaluate (2)
may not contain the element that is the denotation
of &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;. If so, a problem ensues. If the
formula is evaluated left-to-right, the set of
properties denoted by the 7%-expression is
identified, followed by the evaluation of &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;.
This forces the model to expand to contain the
property of talking. The addition of this new
property expands the domain of the set of
properties denoted by &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;, thus forcing the
expansion of the characteristic function of that
set to specify whether or not talking is to be
included. However, because the relationship
between the ?-expression for &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; and the set of
properties denoted is maintained only during the
evaluation of the ?-expression (there is no link
from the denotation back to the expression that it
denotes), there are no restrictions on how the set
is to be expanded. Thus, it is possible to define
the property of talking to have John talking and to
expand the set previously identified as being
denoted by &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; to not include talking, or vice
versa. If such an expansion were made, the
inconsistency would exist only in the evaluation of
that particular formula, and not in the model.
Subsequent evaluations of the sentence would
recompute the denotation of &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; and get the
correct set of properties.
This is not a problem with the direction of
evaluation - the argument to which the 2-expression
is applied may occur to the left of that
A-expression, for example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99185">
(3) [A R R(talk)](AP P(j))
(note: (3) is equivalent to (2) above).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866217391304">
The mechanism that evaluates a formula with
respect to a model has been augmented with a table
that contains each ?-expression and the image of
its denotation in the current stage of the dynamic
model. When the domain of the A-expression
expands, the correct denotational relationship is
maintained by expanding the image in the table
using the A-expression, and then finding the
corresponding element in the model. If the element
in the model that was the denotation of the
A-expression was not expanded in the same way as
the image in this table, a new element
corresponding to the expanded image is added to the
model. This table allows two 7t-expressions that
initially have the same denotation to have
different denotations after the model expands.
Since the expansion of elements in the model is
undirected, an element that was initially the
denotation of a 7k-expression may expand into an
unused element. The accumulation of unused
elements and the repeated comparisions of images in
the table to elements in the model frequently
imposes a high overhead.

IV. THE SECOND MECHANISM - AUGMENTING THE MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999764041666667">
The second mechanism for maintaining the
correctness of the denotations of A-expressions
basically involves incorporating the table from the
first mechanism into the model. In effect, the
A-expressions become meaningful names for the
elements that they denote. These meaningful names
are then used to restrict the expansion of the
named elements; once an element has been identified
as the denotation of a 2-expression, it remains its
denotation.*
In the first mechanism, when the domain of two
A-expressions does not contain any of the elements
that distinguish them, they will have the same
denotation, and when such a distinguishing element
is added to the model, the denotations of the two
A-expressions will become different. With
meaningful names, this is not possible because the
denotational relationship between 0-expression
* Meaningful names are also useful for other
purposes, such as generating sentences from the
information in the model and for providing
procedural rather than declarative -
representations for the information in the model
[Moran 1980].

<bodyText confidence="0.99998905">
and its denotation in the model is permanent.
Since the system cannot anticipate how the model
will be expanded, if it is possible to add to the
domain of two expressions an element that would
distinguish their denotations, those expressions
must be treated as having distinct denotations.
Thus, all and only the logically-equivalent
expressions should be identified as having the same
denotation. If two equivalent expressions were not
so identified, their denotations would be different
elements in the model and this would allow them to
be treated differently. For example, if &amp;quot;John and
Mary&amp;quot; was not identified to be the same as &amp;quot;Mary
and John&amp;quot;, it would be possible to have the model
contain the inconsistent information that &amp;quot;John and
Mary talk&amp;quot; is true and that &amp;quot;Mary and John talk&amp;quot; is
false. If two non-equivalent ,i-expressions were
identified as being equivalent, they would have the
same element as their denotation. When an element
that would distinguish the denotations of these two
expressions was added to the model, the expansion
of the element that was serving as both their
denotations would be incorrect for one of them and
thus introduce an inconsistency.
This need to correctly identify equivalent
expressions presents a problem because even within
the subset of expressions that are the translations
of English phrases in the PTQ fragment, equivalence
is undecidable [Warren 1979.] It is this
undecidability that is the basis of the
introduction of inconsistencies into the model. To
be useful in a natural language understanding
system, this mechanism needs to have timely
determinations of whether or not two expressions
are equivalent, and thus it will use techniques
(including heuristics) that will produce false
answers for some pairs of expressions. It is the
collection of techniques that is used that
determines which inconsistencies will and will not
be admitted into the model.*

V. PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES AND
INTENSIONAL SUBSTITUTIONAL FAILURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994759194444444">
Intensional substitution failure occurs when
one has different beliefs about intensionally-
equivalent propositions. For example, all theorems
are intensionally-equivalent (each is true in all
possible worlds), but it is possible to believe one
proposition that is a theorem and not believe
another. The techniques used by the second
mechanism to identify logically-equivalent formulas
can be viewed as similar to Carnap&apos;s intensional
isomo”phism approach in that it is based on finding
equivalences between the constituents and the
structures of the expressions being compared. This
mechanism can also be viewed as using an
* While the fragment of English used in PTQ is
large enough to demonstrate the introduction of
inconsistent information, it is viewed as not being
large enough to permit interesting claims about
what are useful techniques for testing
equivalences. Consequently, this part of the
mechanism has not been implemented.
&amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; worlds approach: if two
intensionally-equivalent formulas are not
identified as being equivalent, the mechanism
&amp;quot;thinks&amp;quot; that it is possible to expand their domain
to include a distinguishing element. Since the
formulas are equivalent in all possible worlds, the
expected distinguishing element must be an
&amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; world.
The presence of intensional substitution
failure is one of the important tests of a theory
of propositional attitudes. This mechanism is a
correlate of that of Thomason [1980], with the
addition of meaningful names to intensional objects
serving the same purpose as Thomason&apos;s additional
layer of types.

If two non-equivalent ,i-expressions were identified as being equivalent, they would have the same element as their denotation. When an element that would distinguish the denotations of these two expressions was added to the model, the expansion of the element that was serving as both their denotations would be incorrect for one of them and thus introduce an inconsistency. This need to correctly identify equivalent expressions presents a problem because even within the subset of expressions that are the translations of English phrases in the PTQ fragment, equivalence is undecidable [Warren 1979.] It is this undecidability that is the basis of the introduction of inconsistencies into the model. To be useful in a natural language understanding system, this mechanism needs to have timely determinations of whether or not two expressions are equivalent, and thus it will use techniques (including heuristics) that will produce false answers for some pairs of expressions. It is the collection of techniques that is used that determines which inconsistencies will and will not be admitted into the model.* V.
