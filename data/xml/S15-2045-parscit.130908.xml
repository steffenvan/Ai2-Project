Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999785611111111">
In semantic textual similarity (STS), systems
rate the degree of semantic equivalence be-
tween two text snippets. This year, the par-
ticipants were challenged with new datasets in
English and Spanish. The annotations for both
subtasks leveraged crowdsourcing. The En-
glish subtask attracted 29 teams with 74 sys-
tem runs, and the Spanish subtask engaged 7
teams participating with 16 system runs. In
addition, this year we ran a pilot task on in-
terpretable STS, where the systems needed to
add an explanatory layer, that is, they had to
align the chunks in the sentence pair, explicitly
annotating the kind of relation and the score
of the chunk pair. The train and test data were
manually annotated by an expert, and included
headline and image sentence pairs from previ-
ous years. 7 teams participated with 29 runs.

1 Introduction and Motivation

<bodyText confidence="0.999949888888889">
Given two snippets of text, semantic textual sim-
ilarity (STS) captures the notion that some texts
are more similar than others, measuring their de-
gree of semantic equivalence. Textual similarity can
range from complete unrelatedness to exact seman-
tic equivalence, and a graded similarity score intu-
itively captures the notion of intermediate shades of
similarity, as pairs of text may differ from some mi-
nor nuanced aspects of meaning to relatively impor-

tant semantic differences, to sharing only some de-
tails, or to simply unrelated in meaning (cf. Sect. 2).
One of the goals of the STS task is to create a
unified framework for combining several semantic
components that otherwise have historically tended
to be evaluated independently and without character-
ization of impact on NLP applications. By providing
such a framework, STS allows for an extrinsic eval-
uation of these modules. Moreover, such an STS
framework could itself be in turn evaluated intrin-
sically and extrinsically as a grey/black box within
various NLP applications.
STS is related to both textual entailment (TE) and
paraphrasing, but it differs in a number of ways and
it is more directly applicable to a number of NLP
tasks. STS is different from TE inasmuch as it as-
sumes bidirectional graded equivalence between a
pair of textual snippets. In the case of TE the equiv-
alence is directional, e.g. a car is a vehicle, but a ve-
hicle is not necessarily a car. STS also differs from
both TE and paraphrasing (in as far as both tasks
have been defined to date in the literature) in that
rather than being a binary yes/no decision (e.g. a ve-
hicle is not a car), we define STS to be a graded sim-
ilarity notion (e.g. a vehicle and a car are more sim-
ilar than a wave and a car). A quantifiable graded
bidirectional notion of textual similarity is useful for
many NLP tasks such as MT evaluation, information
extraction, question answering, summarization.
In 2012, we held the first pilot task at SemEval
2012, as part of the *SEM 2012 conference, with
great success (Agirre et al., 2012). In addition, we

held a DARPA sponsored workshop at Columbia
University.1 In 2013, STS was selected as the offi-
cial shared task of the *SEM 2013 conference, with
two subtasks: a core task, which was similar to
the 2012 task, and a pilot task on typed-similarity
between semi-structured records. In 2014, new
datasets including new genres were used, and we
expanded the evaluations to address sentence simi-
larity in a new language, namely Spanish (Agirre et
al., 2014).
This year we presented three subtasks: the En-
glish subtask, the Spanish subtask and the inter-
pretable pilot subtask. The English subtask com-
prised pairs from headlines and image descriptions,
and it also introduced new genres, including answer
pairs from a tutorial dialogue system and from Q&amp;A
websites, and pairs from a dataset tagged with com-
mitted belief annotations. For the Spanish subtask,
additional pairs from news and Wikipedia articles
were selected. The annotations for both tasks lever-
aged crowdsourcing. Finally, with the interpretable
STS pilot subtask, we wanted to start exploring
whether participant systems are able to explain why
two sentences are related/unrelated, adding an ex-
planatory layer to the similarity score.

computed the string similarity between those pairs.
Accordingly, we sampled 1000 headline pairs of

scription systems. It was also sampled using string
similarity, discarding those that had been used in
previous years. We organized two bins with 1000
pairs each: one with pairs of descriptions from the
same image, and the other one with pairs of descrip-
tions from different images.

the student response analysis task of Semeval-2013.
Given a question, a known correct ”reference an-
swer” and the ”student answer”, the goal of the task
was to assess whether student answers were correct,
contradictory or incorrect (partially correct, irrele-
vant or not in the domain). For STS, we selected
pairs of answers made up of single sentences. The
pairs were sampled from string similarity values be-
tween 0.6 and 1.
The Answers-forums dataset consists of paired
answers collected from the Stack Exchange question
and answer websites (http://stackexchange.com/).
Some of the paired answers are responses to the
same question, while others are responses to differ-
ent questions. Each answer in the pair consists of a
statement composed of a single sentence or sentence
fragment. For multi-sentence answers, we extracted
the single sentence from the larger answer that ap-
pears to best summarize the answer.
The Belief pairs were collected from the
DEFT Committed Belief Annotation dataset
(LDC2014E55). All source documents are English
Discussion Forum data. We sampled 2000 pairs
using string similarity values between 0.5 and 1.
It is worth noting that the similarity values were
skewed, with very few pairs above 0.8 similarity.
In an attempt to improve the quality of the data,
we selected 2000 pairs from each dataset and anno-
tated them. This ”raw” data was automatically fil-
tered in order to achieve the following three (par-
tially conflicting) goals: (1) to obtain a more uni-
form distribution across scores; (2) to select pairs
with high inter-annotator agreement; (3) to select
pairs which were difficult for a string-matching

baseline. The filtering process was purely automated
and involved no manual selection of pairs. The raw
annotations and the Perl scripts that generated the
final gold standard are available at the task web-
site. See Table 2 for the number of selected pairs
per dataset.
Table 1 shows the explanations and values asso-
ciated with each score between 5 and 0. As in prior
years, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)2
to crowdsource the annotation of the English pairs.
Five sentence pairs were presented to each annota-
tor at once, per human intelligence task (HIT), at
a payrate of $0.20. We collected five separate an-
notations per sentence pair. Annotators were only
eligible to work on the task if they had the Mechan-
ical Turk Master Qualification, a special qualifica-
tion conferred by AMT (using a priority statistical
model) to annotators who consistently maintain a
very high level of quality across a variety of tasks
from numerous requesters. Access to these skilled
workers entails a 20% surcharge.
To monitor the quality of the annotations, we used
a gold dataset of 105 pairs that were manually anno-
tated by the task organizers during STS 2013. We in-
cluded one of these gold pairs in each set of five sen-
tence pairs, where the gold pairs were indistinguish-
able from the rest. Unlike when we ran on Crowd-
Flower for STS 2013, the gold pairs were not used
for training purposes, neither were workers automat-
ically banned from the task if they made too many
mistakes annotating the pairs. Rather, the gold pairs
were only used to help in identifying and removing
the data associated with poorly performing annota-
tors. With few exceptions, 90% of the answers from
each individual annotator fell within +/-1 of the an-
swers selected by the organizers for the gold dataset.
The distribution of scores obtained from the AMT
providers in the all the datasets is roughly uniform
across the different grades of similarity, although the
scores are slightly lower for Belief. Compared to
the other datasets, the Answer-students dataset has
considerably fewer 0 scores.
In order to assess the annotation quality, we mea-
sure the correlation of each annotator with the aver-
age of the rest of the annotators, and then average
the results. This approach to estimate the quality
is identical to the method used for evaluations (see

bound of the systems. The pre-filtering inter-tagger
correlation for each English dataset is as follows:

2.2 Spanish Subtask
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985975">
The Spanish subtask follows a setup similar to the
English subtask, except that the similarity scores
were adapted to fit a range from 0 to 4 (see Table 1).
We thought that the distinction between a score of 3
and 4 for the English task would pose more difficulty
for us in conveying into Spanish, as the sole differ-
ence between the two lies in how the annotators per-
ceive the importance of additional details or missing
information with respect to the core semantic inter-
pretation of the pair. As this aspect entails a subjec-
tive judgement, we casted the annotation guidelines
into straightforward and unambiguous instructions,
and thus opted to use a similarity range from 0 to 4.
Prior to the evaluation window, the participants
had access to a trial dataset consisting of 65 sen-
tence pairs annotated for similarity and the test data
released as part of SemEval 2014 Task 10 (Agirre
et al., 2014), consisting of approximately 800 sen-
tence pairs extracted from Spanish newswire and
encyclopedic content. For the evaluations, we con-
structed two datasets, one extracted from the Span-
ish Wikipedia3 (December 2013 dump) consisting
of 251 sentence pairs, and the other one from con-
temporary news articles collected from news media
in Spanish (November 2014) of 500 pairs.

cessed using the Parse::MediaWikiDump Perl li-
brary. We removed all titles, html tags, wiki tags and

hyperlinks (keeping only the surface forms). Each
article was split into paragraphs, where the first para-
graph was considered to be the article’s abstract,
while the remaining ones were deemed to be its con-
tent. Each of these were split into sentences us-
ing the Perl library Uplug::PreProcess::SentDetect,
and only the sentences longer than eight words were
used. We iteratively computed the lexical similar-
ity4 between every sentence in the abstract and ev-
ery sentence in the content, and retained those pairs
whose sentence length ratio was higher than 0.5, and
their similarity scored over 0.35.
The final set of sentence pairs was split into five
bins, and their scores were normalized to range from
0 to 1. The more interesting and difficult pairs were
found, perhaps not surprisingly, in bin 0, where syn-
onyms/short paraphrases were more frequent, and
251 sentence pairs were manually selected from this
bin in order to ensure a diverse and challenging set.
We then proceeded to annotate the sentence pairs
for textual similarity by designing an AMT task, fol-
lowing a similar structure as in 2014, namely creat-
ing HITs consisting of seven sentence pairs, where
six of them were a subset of the newly developed
dataset, and one of them was reused from 2014 data
with the purpose of control and to enable annotation
quality comparisons.5 As in the previous year, AMT
providers were eligible to complete a task if they had
more than 500 accepted HITs, with an over 90% ac-
ceptance rate. Each HIT was annotated by five AMT
providers, and the remuneration was of $0.30 per
HIT.6 The final sentence pair similarity scores was
computed by averaging over the judgments of the
five AMT providers.
In order to assess the robustness of the AMT an-
notations, we computed the Pearson correlation be-
tween the similarity scores newly assigned to the
control sentences, and those assigned in 2014. We
obtained a measure of over 0.92, indicating a high
resemblance between the two sets of judgements
and highlighting the consistency of crowd wisdom,
which is able to produce coherent outcomes irre-
spective of the individuals participating in the de-
cision process.

Spanish News. The second Spanish dataset was
extracted from news articles published in Spanish
language media from around the world in Novem-
ber 2014. The hyperlinks to the articles were ob-
tained by parsing the ”International” page of Span-
ish Google News,7 which aggregates or clusters in
real time articles describing a particular event from
a diverse pool of news sites, where each grouping is
labeled with the title of one of the predominant arti-
cles. By leveraging these clusters of links pointing
to the sites where the articles were originally pub-
lished, we were able to gather raw text that had a
high probability to contain semantically similar sen-
tences. We encountered several difficulties while
mining the articles, ranging from each article hav-
ing its own formatting depending on the source site,
to advertisements, cookie requirements, to encoding
for Spanish diacritics. We used the lynx text-based
browser,8 which was able to standardize the raw arti-
cles to a degree. The output of the browser was pro-
cessed using a rule based approach taking into ac-
count continuous text span length, ratio of symbols
and numbers to the text, etc., in order to determine
when a paragraph is part of the article content. Af-
ter that, a second pass over the predictions corrected
mislabeled paragraphs if they were preceded and
followed by paragraphs identified as content. All
the content pertaining to articles on the same event
was joined, sentence split, and diff pairwise similar-
ities were computed. The set of candidate sentences
followed the same constraints as those enforced for
the Wikipedia dataset. From these, we manually ex-
tracted 500 sentence pairs, which were annotated
in an AMT task mirroring the same setup as used
for the encyclopedic data annotation. The correla-
tion between this year’s annotations and those of the
2014 STS task using the control sentence pairs re-
mained high, at 0.886.
Since historically many of the text-to-text similar-
ity algorithms have relied heavily on lexical match-
ing, this year’s Spanish datasets featured sentence
pairs with a higher degree of difficulty. This was
achieved by handpicking pairs which shared some
common vocabulary, yet carried completely differ-
ent meanings at the sentence level.

<bodyText confidence="0.99978897826087">
Given the setup of STS tasks to date, this year we
wanted to shift focus, and gauge the ability of par-
ticipating systems to explain why two sentences may
be related/unrelated, by supplementing the similar-
ity score with an explanatory layer. As a first step
in this direction, given a pair of sentences, systems
needed to align the chunks across both sentences,
and for each alignment, classify the type of relation 9
and provide the corresponding similarity score. 10
In previous work, Brockett (2007) and Rus et
al. (2012) produced a dataset where corresponding
words (including some multiword expressions like
named-entities) were aligned. Although this align-
ment is useful, we wanted to move forward to the
alignment of segments, and decided to align chunks
(Abney, 1991). Brockett (2007) did not provide
any label to alignments, while Rus et al. (2012) de-
fined a basic typology. In our task, we provided a
more detailed typology for the aligned chunks as
well as a similarity/relatedness score for each align-
ment. Contrary to the mentioned works, we first
identified the segments (chunks in our case) in each
sentence separately, and then aligned them. In a dif-
ferent strand of work, Nielsen et al. (2009) defined a
textual entailment model where the “facets” (words
under some syntactic/semantic relation) in the re-
sponse of a student were linked to the concepts in
the reference answer. The link would signal whether
each facet in the response was entailed by the refer-
ence answer or not, but would not explicitly mark
which parts of the reference answer caused the en-
tailment. This model was later followed by Levy et
al. (2013). Our task was different in that we iden-
tified the corresponding chunks in both sentences.
We think that, in the future, the aligned facets could
provide complementary information to chunks.
For interpretable STS the similarity scores range
from 0 to 5, as in the English subtask. With re-
spect to the relation between the aligned chunks, the
present pilot only allowed 1:1 alignments. As a con-
sequence, we had to include a special alignment con-
text tag (ALIC) to simulate those chunks which had
some semantic similarity or relatedness in the other
sentence, but could not have been aligned because of
the 1:1 restriction. In the case of the aligned chunks,
the following relatedness tags were defined:

meanings, but which include different level of
detailed information, chunk in sentence1 more
specific than chunk in sentence2, or vice versa.
• SIMI, for chunks with similar meanings, but no
EQUI, OPPO, SPE1, or SPE2.
• REL, for chunks which have related meanings,
but no EQUI, OPPO, SPE1, SPE2, or SIMI.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987838">
In addition, a pair of chunks could be annotated
with factuality (FACT) and polarity (POL), if there
was a phenomena associated to those which made
the meaning of the two chunks different. Finally,
in the case of chunks which did not have any sim-
ilarity/relatedness in the other sentence, they were
tagged as NOALI.
The pilot presented two scenarios: sentence raw
text and gold standard chunks. In the first scenario,
given a pair of sentences, participants had to identify
the composing chunks, and then align them; after
that they would assign a relatedness tag and a simi-
larity score to each alignment. In the gold standard
scenario, participants were provided with the gold
standard chunks, which were based on those used in
the CoNLL 2000 chunking task (Tjong Kim Sang
and Buchholz, 2000), with some adaptations (see

The training and test datasets consisted of 1500
and 753 sentence pairs, respectively, extracted from
the HDL and Images datasets used in 2014. Listing

3.1 Evaluation Metrics

<bodyText confidence="0.9990535">
As in previous exercises, we used Pearson product-
moment correlation between the system scores
and the GS scores. In order to compute statis-
tical significance among system results, we use
a one-tailed parametric test based on Fisher’s z-
transformation (Press et al., , equation 14.5.10).

3.2 Baseline System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949333333333">
In order to provide a simple word overlap baseline
(Baseline-tokencos), we tokenized the input sen-
tences splitting on white spaces, and then each sen-
tence was represented as a vector in the multidimen-
sional token space. Each dimension had 1 if the to-
ken was present in the sentence, 0 otherwise. Vector
similarity was computed using cosine similarity.
We also ran the TakeLab system (ˇSari´c et al.,
2012) from STS 2012, which yielded strong results
in previous years evaluations.9. The system was
trained on all previous datasets STS12, STS13 and
STS14, and tested on each subset of STS15.

29 teams participated in the English subtask, sub-
mitting 74 system runs. One team submitted fixes
on one run past the deadline, as explicitly marked
in Table 3. After the submission deadline expired,
the organizers published the gold standard, the eval-
uation script, the scripts to generate the gold stan-
dard from raw annotation files, and participant sub-
missions on the task website, in order to ensure a
transparent evaluation process. As regards the Span-
ish STS task, it attracted 7 teams, which participated
with 16 system runs.

of the baseline, which would rank 61st, and Take-
Lab, which was trained with all datasets from pre-
vious years. TakeLab would rank 42nd, 10 absolute
points below the best system, a larger difference than
in 2014.
The highest results are for images (87.1%, by
Samsung) and headlines (84.2%, by Samsung), fol-
lowed by answers-students (78.8%, by DLS@CU),
belief (77.2%, by IITNLP) and answers-forums
(73.9% by DLS@CU). Note that the highest results
are very close but below the inter-annotator corre-
lation, with the exception of belief, where the sys-
tems attain a better correlation than the annotators
(88.8%, 86.9%, 82.2%, 72.1% and 74.2%, respec-
tively).
The results of the best system run were signifi-
cantly different (p-value &lt; 0.05) from the 11th top
scoring system run and below. The top 10 systems
did not show statistical significant variation among
them. None of these runs was significantly different
from any other in the top ten runs, indicating that the
best systems performed very close to each other.
Regarding the relative difficulty of headlines and
images in 2014 and 2015, both baseline and best sys-
tem perform better this year than in 2014, but the
differences between baseline and best system has in-
creased in headlines, while it is similar in images.

3.4.1 Analysing the Full Dataset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902266666667">
On a separate note, we felt filtering was specif-
ically needed for new datasets, in order to guaran-
tee a minimum quality. For datasets like images
and headlines, where the sampling strategy was al-
ready shown to work, it might not be as necessary.
For completeness, we also evaluated the systems on
the full set of annotations. The system scoring best
was the same as in the official test set (DLS@CU-
S1), with a mean correlation of 73.4%. The baseline
scored 49.6%, and it would rank in position 55. The
best results in each dataset decreased more or less
uniformly. The filtering ensured a test set of better
quality, but we interpret that the full set can also be
used for development. It’s available from the task
website.

3.6 Spanish Subtask Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999474">
The official evaluation results of the Spanish sub-
task are presented in Table 4. The last row,
Baseline-tokencos, shows the results obtained us-
ing the same baseline as for the English STS task,
which 69% of the system runs were able to sur-
pass. Only about one fifth of the systems were un-
supervised, among which, the top performing sys-
tem, UMDuluth-BlueTeam-run1, was able to come
within 0.1 correlation points from the top perform-
ing system on Wikipedia and within 0.03 on the
Newswire dataset. This relatively narrow gap sug-
gests that unsupervised semantic textual similarity is
a viable option for languages with limited resources.
Statistical significance tests were performed
across the teams, by only considering their best run.
In the case of the Wikipedia dataset, all runs were
significantly different (at p-value &lt; 0.05) with re-
spect to the other teams; the same behavior was en-
countered on the newswire dataset, with the excep-
tion of two pairs of system runs that were not sta-
tistically different (ExBThemis &amp; RTM-DCU, and
MiniExperts &amp; Yamraj).
Our efforts for generating closer to real-life tex-
tual similarity scenarios, and thus more difficult
cases to be discerned by automated systems, were
reflected in the lower correlations obtained on this
year’s datasets in comparison to those of 2014. For
Wikipedia, the highest ranking system, ExBThemis-
trainMini, achieved a correlation of 0.70, while in
2014, the highest correlation on the same dataset
type was of 0.78. This difference was even steeper
for the newswire data, where the top system,
ExBThemis-trainEs, scored 0.683 in comparison to
2014, where the top ranked system attained a corre-
lation of 0.845.

4.2 Baseline System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920214285714">
The baseline system used for the interpretable sub-
task consists of a cascade concatenation of several
procedures. First, we undertake a brief NLP step
in which input sentences are tokenized using sim-
ple regular expressions. Additionally, this step col-
lects chunk regions coming either from gold stan-
dard or from the chunking done by ixa-pipes-chunk
(Agerri et al., 2014). This is followed by a lower-
cased token aligning phase, which consists of align-
ing (or linking) identical tokens across the input sen-
tences. Then we use chunk boundaries as token re-
gions to group individual tokens into groups, and
compute all links across groups. The weight of the
link across groups is proportional to the number of
links counted between within-group tokens. The
next phase consists of an optimization step in which
groups x,y that have the highest link weight are iden-
tified, as well as the chunks that are linked to either
x or y but not with a maximum alignment weight
(thus enabling us to know which chunks were left
unaligned). Finally, in the last phase, the baseline
system uses a rule-based algorithm to directly as-
sign labels and scores: to chunks with the highest
link weight assign label = “EQUI” and score = 5,
to the rest of aligned chunks (with lower weights)
assign label = “ALIC” and score = NIL, and, to un-
aligned chunks assign label = “NOALI” and score =
NIL.

Headlines dataset and ’I’ corresponds to the Images
dataset. A unique baseline was used for both eval-
uation scenarios and its performance is jointly pre-
sented with the scores obtained by participants.
Results clearly show that the system chunks sce-
nario was considerably more challenging than the
gold chunks scenario. Actually, the complexity of
the evaluation was incremental for the four available
metrics, and, the most challenging F Type+Score
metric performance seems bounded by the perfor-
mance obtained in the F alignment metric, which
obviously, was lower for the system chunks.
With regard to both datasets, the Images dataset
ended up being more challenging than the Headlines
dataset. For instance, in the gold chunks scenario,
the participant average F Type+Score metric reached
0.4748 for the Images dataset (compared to 0.5381
for Headlines).10 The maximum value obtained by
participants was also higher, as it reached 0.6426
and 0.5964 respectively for Headlines and Images.
Under the system chunks scenario, the average re-
sults followed the same tendency, as the participant
average F Type+Score metric reached 0.3912 for
the Images dataset and 0.4335 for Headlines (both
values lower than the ones obtained for the gold
chunks). In contrast, the maximum metric obtained
by participants was in this case greater for Images,
as it reached 0.5634, attaining 0.5098 for Headlines.

used NLP tools for preprocessing are Stanford’s
NLP parser and the OpenNLP framework. Actu-
ally, all of the teams confirmed that they performed
some kind of input text processing such as lemma-
tization, part of speech tagging or syntactic parsing.
Additional resources such as named-entity recogni-
tion and acronym repositories, ConceptNet, NLTK,
time and date resolution or PPDB were also used by
most of the participants. Participants also revealed
that most of their systems were built using some
kind of distributional or knowledge-based similarity
metrics. We noticed, for instance, that WordNet or
Mikolov embeddings were used by several teams to
compute word similarity.

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999900933333333">
This year participants were challenged with new
datasets for English and Spanish, including image
captions, news headlines, Wikipedia articles, news,
and new genres like answers from a tutorial dia-
logue system, answers from Q&amp;A websites, and
commited belief. The crowdsourced annotations had
a high inter-tagger agreement. The English subtask
attracted 29 teams, while the Spanish subtask had 7
teams.
In addition, we succesfully introduced a new sub-
task on interpretability, where systems add a ex-
planatory layer, in the form of alignments between
text segments, explicitly annotating the kind of rela-
tion and the score for each segment pair. The inter-
pretable subtask attracted 7 teams.

This year, the participants were challenged with new datasets in English and Spanish. The annotations for both subtasks leveraged crowdsourcing. The English subtask attracted 29 teams with 74 system runs, and the Spanish subtask engaged 7 teams participating with 16 system runs. In addition, this year we ran a pilot task on interpretable STS, where the systems needed to add an explanatory layer, that is, they had to align the chunks in the sentence pair, explicitly annotating the kind of relation and the score of the chunk pair.

(2012) produced a dataset where corresponding words (including some multiword expressions like named-entities) were aligned. Although this alignment is useful, we wanted to move forward to the alignment of segments, and decided to align chunks (Abney, 1991). Brockett (2007) did not provide any label to alignments, while Rus et al. (2012) defined a basic typology. In our task, we provided a more detailed typology for the aligned chunks as well as a similarity/relatedness score for each alignment. Contrary to the mentioned works, we first identified the segments (chunks in our case) in each sentence separately, and then aligned them. In a different strand of work, Nielsen et al. (2009) defined a textual entailment model where the “facets” (words under some syntactic/semantic relation) in the response of a student were linked to the concepts in the</context>

First, we undertake a brief NLP step in which input sentences are tokenized using simple regular expressions. Additionally, this step collects chunk regions coming either from gold standard or from the chunking done by ixa-pipes-chunk (Agerri et al., 2014). This is followed by a lowercased token aligning phase, which consists of aligning (or linking) identical tokens across the input sentences. Then we use chunk boundaries as token regions to group individual tokens into groups, and compute all links across groups. The weight of the link across groups is proportional to the number of links counted between within-group tokens. The next phase consists of an optimization step in which groups x,y that have the highest link weight are identified, as well as the chunks that are linked to either x or y but not with a maximum alignment weight (thus ena</context>

In 2014, new datasets including new genres were used, and we expanded the evaluations to address sentence similarity in a new language, namely Spanish (Agirre et al., 2014). This year we presented three subtasks: the English subtask, the Spanish subtask and the interpretable pilot subtask. The English subtask comprised pairs from headlines and image descriptions, and it also introduced new genres, including answer pairs from a tutorial dialogue system and from Q&amp;A websites, and pairs from a dataset tagged with committed belief annotations. For the Spanish subtask, additional pairs from news and Wikipedia articles were selected. The annotations for both tasks leveraged crowdsourcing. Finally, with the interpretable STS pilot subtask, we wanted to start exploring </context>

As this aspect entails a subjective judgement, we casted the annotation guidelines into straightforward and unambiguous instructions, and thus opted to use a similarity range from 0 to 4. Prior to the evaluation window, the participants had access to a trial dataset consisting of 65 sentence pairs annotated for similarity and the test data released as part of SemEval 2014 Task 10 (Agirre et al., 2014), consisting of approximately 800 sentence pairs extracted from Spanish newswire and encyclopedic content. For the evaluations, we constructed two datasets, one extracted from the Spanish Wikipedia3 (December 2013 dump) consisting of 251 sentence pairs, and the other one from contemporary news articles collected from news media in Spanish (November 2014) of 500 pairs.

Spanish News. The second Spanish dataset was extracted from news articles published in Spanish language media from around the world in November 2014. The hyperlinks to the articles were obtained by parsing the ”International” page of Spanish Google News,7 which aggregates or clusters in real time articles describing a particular event from a diverse pool of news sites, where each grouping is labeled with the title of one of the predominant articles.

We organized two bins with 1000 pairs each: one with pairs of descriptions from the same image, and the other one with pairs of descriptions from different images.

Finally, in the case of chunks which did not have any similarity/relatedness in the other sentence, they were tagged as NOALI. The pilot presented two scenarios: sentence raw text and gold standard chunks. In the first scenario, given a pair of sentences, participants had to identify the composing chunks, and then align them; after that they would assign a relatedness tag and a similarity score to each alignment. In the gold standard scenario, participants were provided with the gold standard chunks, which were based on those used in the CoNLL 2000 chunking task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), with some adaptations (see annotation guidelines available at the task website).
