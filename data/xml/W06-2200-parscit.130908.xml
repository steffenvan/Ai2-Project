INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993692">
With the explosive growth of the Web and intranets, the amount of information that is available in
unstructured and semistructured documents keeps increasing at an unprecedented rate. These terabytes
of text contain valuable information for virtually every domain of activity, from education to business
to counter-terrorism. However, existing tools for accessing and exploiting this data are just not effective
enough to satisfy user expectations.
Recent years have brought significant interest and progress in developing techniques for the automatic
extraction and mining of information from text. In contrast to the previous generation of extraction
systems which relied on (expensive and brittle) hand-written rules, most recent approaches use machine
learning techniques to uncover the structure of text. To further reduce the users’ burden, researchers
are also investigating a variety of active, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms that
minimize the amount of labeled documents required for training.
The increasing interest of adaptive extraction and mining from texts is also demonstrated by several
recent initiatives:

<listItem confidence="0.9712576">
• The Automatic Content Extraction program was started a few years ago by NIST
(www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/ace).
• The PASCAL challenge on Machine Learning for Information Extraction, whose aim was to assess
the current state of the art, dentifying future challenges and to foster additional research in the field
(nlp.shef.ac.uk/pascal).
• Various initiatives related to the life sciences, such as BioCreAtIvE
(Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology;
www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/BioLINK/BioCreative.eval.html), and the Shared Task proposed at
the International Joint Workshop on Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine and its
Applications; research.nii.ac.jp/ collier/workshops/JNLPBA04st.htm).

Adaptive extraction and mining from texts is an extremely active area of research that lies at the
intersection of diverse fields such as information extraction, text mining, machine learning, data mining,
link analysis and relationship discovery, information retrieval, natural language processing, information
integration, distributed databases, and knowledge capture. Developments in any of these fields have an
immediate effect on the others, so it is important to foster the free exchange of ideas among researchers
that work on the various aspects of adaptive text extraction and mining. The purpose of this workshop
is to bring together researchers and practitioners from all these communities, so that they can discuss
recent results and foster new directions of research in the field. The workshop builds on the success of
previous workshops on the same topic at AAAI-1999, ECAI-2000, IJCAI-2001, ECML 2003, and AAAI-
2004 (see www.isi.edu/info-agents/RISE/Resources.html for details). The workshop will also serve to
follow up ideas discussed at the 2005 Dagstuhl Workshop on Machine Learning for the Semantic Web
(www.smi.ucd.ie/Dagstuhl-MLSW), much of which focused on adaptive information extraction.
The program includes nine papers: eight papers come from from Europe (Germany, Italy, Ireland,
Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands, United Kingdom), one from Japan/USA. Each paper was reviewed by
at least two reviewers.
We thank the reviewers for their cooperation in the reviewing process, especially considering the very
short interval between submission and notification.
