This paper presents a new perspective on the use of semantic an-
notations. We argue that semantic annotations should (1) capture
semantic information that is complimentary to the information that is
expressed in the source text; (2) have a formal interpretation. If these
conditions are fullfilled, then the information in semantic annotations
can be effectively combined with the information in the source text
by interpreting a semantic annotation language through the transla-
tion of annotations into the same formalism as underspecified semantic
representations obtained through compositional semantic analysis.

1 Introduction

Annotations add information to a source text. In the pre-digital age, ad-
notations characteristically took the form of an editor’s bibliographical or
historical comments, presented in notes that are added to the source text.
In the digital age, annotations take on a different form, but their function is
essentially the same: they add information to a source text. The following
example illustrates this.
In (1a) an annotation in the form of a note adds certain historical in-
formation to the text; it is indeed additive in the sense that it contains
information which is not in the text itself. In (1b), by contrast, the infor-
mation in the note is in fact already contained in the text itself, and the
annotation therefore does not make any sense.

It may seem obvious that annotations do not make sense if they do not
add any information, but consider the following example of annotating text
with temporal information using TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.9081495">

&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&amp;quot;t1&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;date&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;2008-12-01&amp;quot;/ &gt;
the first of December 2008
&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;
&lt;/timeml&gt;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996994">
The annotation in this case does not contain any information which is
not already in the text itself; it only casts the description of a date the first
of December 2008 in the alternative format “2008-12-01.
By contrast, a case where semantic annotation would really add some-
thing, is the following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.947811">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998346">
In the absence of further temporal information (when was this sentence
uttered/written/published/..?) we don’t know what day is referred to by
‘today’. In this case it would help to have the semantic annotation (4), added
by someone (or by a computer program) who possesses that information or
is able to find it, for instance by having access to relevant metadata.

If the point of annotations is to add certain information to a given source
text, then the point of semantic annotations can only be to add semantic
information that is not already in the text. We suggest that this additional
information can be precisely the information whose absence causes the in-
terpretation of sentences to be underspecified, as illustrated in (3), or that
causes ambiguities such as the one in (5).

<bodyText confidence="0.9930405">
The semantic analysis of this sentence tells us that someone called ‘John’
saw someone called ‘Peter’, and that this happened at the moment that one
of them left the house. If it is known that ‘he’ actually refers to Peter, this
could be captured by the semantic annotation in (6):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.98436">

Other types of ambiguity which could benefit from additional informa-
tion in semantic annotations for example concern relative scoping, semantic
roles, discourse relations, and dialogue acts, as illustrated in (7) - (10).

These examples all have in common that they contain an ambiguity which
cannot be resolved on the basis of the text alone. The additional information
that is needed to deal with such ambiguities has to come from elsewhere, such
as from donain knowledge, from knowledge about the situation of utterance,
or from metadata.
Ambiguities whose resolution requires information from outside the text
are a problem for compositional semantics approaches. Compositional gen-
eration of all the possible alternative semantic representations (and sub-
sequent filtering) leads to a combinatorial explosion in the interpretation
process (see Bunt &amp; Muskens, 1999). Underspecified semantic representa-
tions (USRs) have been proposed as way to get around this, but suffer from
the limitation that reasoning directly with USRs is problematic; in most
applications, it is necessary to resolve the underspecifications at some stage
and to create a fully disambiguated representation.
In this paper we argue that semantic annotations can be helpful for
effectively dealing with ambiguities if they have a formal semantics, and
in particular if their interpretation makes use of the same representational
formalism as that of underspecified semantic representations.
Since digital texts and their annotations are machine-readable and elec-
tronically exchangeable, an issue for annotation in the digital age is that
it would be beneficial if different researchers use the same concepts for ex-
pressing the same information and put their annotations in a suitable inter-
change format, thus allowing the effective re-use of each other’s annotated
resources. This ideal has in recent years been taken up by an expert group
of the international organization for standardization ISO, concerned with
the interoperability of language resources.
The inspiration for this paper comes from participating in the ‘Semantic
Annotation Framework’ initiative of the ISO organization and the Euro-
pean eContent project LIRICS (Linguistic Infrastructure for Interoperable
Resources and Systems, http://lirics.loria.fr), that was set up and
carried out by ISO expert group members. Building on studies on in the LIR-
ICS project, two ISO projects have started in 2007 and 2008, respectively,
that aim at proposing standards for the annotation of temporal informa-
tion and for annotating the communicative functions of dialogue utterances.
Both projects include the design of sets of well-defined and well-documented
concepts for semantic annotation which are made publicly available in an on-
line registry (following ISO standard 12620 - see http://www.isocat.org).
Modern annotations typically take the form of XML tags, as illustrated
in (2), (4), and (6), where the kind of attributes and values in the tags
depend on the purpose of the annotation: morphosyntactic, part-of-speech,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989568">

<bodyText confidence="0.984137675675676">
syntactic, etc. Following the Linguistic Annotation Framework (Ide and
Romary, 2004; ISO, 2008b), ISO projects insist on using standoff annotation,
where the annotations are contained in a separate file with pointers to the
source text file, rather than using in-line annotation as in (2), (4), and (6).
We will return to this in section 3, where this will turn out to be important
for the correct combination of semantic annotations and USRs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we very
briefly consider recent work aiming at the definition of semantic annota-
tion languages that have a formal semantics. Sections 3 and 4 deal with
two ‘alignment’ problems that arise in the combination of semantic anno-
tations with underspecified semantic representations. First, the two should
preferably be ‘aligned’ in using the same representation formalism. This is
the subject of Section 3. Second, the components of semantic annotation
structures and underspecified semantic representation structures should be
aligned in that they relate to the same stretches of source text. This is the
subject of Section 4. Section 5 closes with some concluding remarks.
2 The semantics of semantic annotations
Like other forms of annotation, such as POS annotation, semantic annota-
tion has mostly been viewed as a form of text labelling. This may for example
be useful in corpus-linguistic research, supporting the search of certain lin-
guistic patterns, or for finding certain types of information, such as temporal
information. On the other hand when we look at the (simplified) TimeML
annotations shown in (2) and (4), we note that there is in fact an effort to
use XML attributes and values to not just put a flag in a text, signalling
that there is temporal information there, but also to describe the content
that information. What is lacking ‘only’ is a semantics of this language.
Recent attempts to provide a semantics for semantic annotations in-
clude the Interval Temporal Logic semantics for TimeML by Pratt-Hartman
(2005); the event-based semantics for TimeML by Bunt &amp; Overbeeke (2008a),
and other attempts to formally interpret temporal annotations by Katz
(2007) and Lee (2008). The most elaborate proposal for a semantics of
semantic annotation is formulated in Bunt (2007) and Bunt &amp; Overbeeke
(2008b), where a semantic annotation language is presented with a formal
semantics, that integrates temporal information, semantic roles, and coref-
erence relations. This semantics translates annotations in a systematic,
compositional manner into first-order or second-order logic.l
&apos;First-order logic suffices in most cases, but second-order logic is needed for cases of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997345">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999060857142857">
Since first-order logic is formally equivalent with Discourse Representa-
tion Structures (and second-order logic to DRSs with second-order discourse
referents), this semantics can be recast in the form of a translation into
DRSs. Rather than spelling out how this can be done, we refer to Bunt &amp;
Overbeeke (2008b) and exploit the well-established equivalence with DRSs.
For example, the annotation representation in (6) translates into the DRS
&lt; {x, y, z}, {john(x), peter(y), saw(x, y), male(z), leftthehouse(z), z = y}} &gt;

3 Combining USRs and semantic annotations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994999833333333">
Reasoning is the combination of pieces of information – so that’s what needs
to be done when the information in semantic annotations is combined with
that in USRs. If we are able to interpret semantic annotations by translating
them into the same representational format as USRs, then the reasoning
process can take on a very simple form: unification.
A range of representational and processing techniques have been pro-
posed for underspecified semantic representation; in the overview in Bunt
(2007), it is argued that the use of labels (as in UDRT, Reyle,1993) and
hole variables (as in Hole Semantics, Bos, 1996) or ‘handles’ (as in MRS,
Copestake et al., 1997), in combination with the use of metavariables (as
proposed e.g. by Pinkal, 1999) allows the underspecified representation of
a wide range of semantic phenomena. Labels etc. are particularly useful
for the underspecified respresentation of structural ambiguities like relative
scoping and PP attachment, while metavariables are suitable for local ambi-
guities like anaphora, metonymy, and sense ambiguities. We will therefore
cast the formal semantics of semantic annotations in the form of UDRSs
with labels and hole variables, extended by allowing metavariables to occur
in conditions.2

We first illustrate the combination of USRs and semantic annotations for
simple cases of (a) relative scope resolution; (b) coreference resolution; (c)
the interpretation of temporal deixis. In the next subsection we show that
more complex cases may involve a technical complication for ensuring that
the underspecified parts of USRs and the information in semantic annota-
collective coreference.

‘alignment’ problem can be solved.
In (11b) we see on the left the underspecified representation of the quan-
tifier scopes in (sentence 11a), and on the right the AIR of the annotation,
indicating in its bottom part that the universal quantifier has wider scope.
The bottom part of the USR contains the scope constraints on the possible
ways of combining the various conditions and sub-DRS’s contained in the
upper part into a complete DRS. The operator ‘®’ constructs a DRS from
the labeled structures that it operates on.

Unification of the two representations includes the label unifications T3=L3
and T6=L7, which has the effect that the AIR scope constraint adds the
constraint L3 &gt; L7 to the USR. This has the result that of the two possible
‘pluggings’ of the hole variables in the USR (h0=L1, h1=L2, h2=L6, h3=L7;
and h0=L2, h1=L6, h2=L1, h3=L7) the second one is ruled out. This
reflects that the semantic annotation resolves the ambiguity.
In (12b), the part on the left shows the USR of the sentence (12a), while
the part on the right shows the Annotation Interpretation Representation
(AIR) in the same UDRS-based formalism. Combination of the two takes
the form of a simple unification, where label variables are unified as well as
discourse markers. The unification(with T1=L1, a=x; T3=L3, b=y; L2=T2;
L4=T4; L8=T6), results in (13), which is an ordinary DRS (of which the
unified labels have been suppressed).

The use of metavariables assumes an interpretation process where these
variables are at some stage instantiated by ordinary expressions of the rep-
resentation language. By treating metavariables indeed as variables in the
unification process, they are instantiated by the corresponding terms in the
semantic annotations.
The above examples all suggest that the information contained in se-
mantic annotations can be combined with that in underspecified semantic
representations in a straightforward way, using unification. There is a com-
plication, however, which does not turn up in these simple examples, namely

The AIR in (15) makes perfect sense if we interpret the discourse referent
‘c’ as corresponding to the first occurrence of ‘he’; ‘d’ to the second; and
‘h’ to the third. There is however nothing in the AIR that enforces this
interpretation; the AIR is not in any way ‘aligned’ with the source text or
with the USR, and allows e.g. the components {T5: c, T6: he(c), T7: c=b}
to be unified with the USR components {L1: x, L2: john(x)}.
This problem can be resolved by taking into account that, as mentioned
above, according to the ISO Linguistic Annotation Framework annotations
should be represented in a stand-off format, in a separate file with pointers to
source text segments. This means that, instead of an in-line representation
like (6), we should consider annotations in a format like (16), where the
referential information is ‘anchored’ to source text segments:

‘john(a)’, ‘bill(b)’ and ‘he(c)’ would seem to anchor ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ to their

ditions like ‘john(a)’ in the AIR fully redundant, and allows it to be reduced
to the introduction of the discourse referents and the conditions specify-
ing the coreference relations. The corresponding annotation is then indeed
complimentary to the USR.

4 Conclusions and perspectives

In this paper we have indicated how the information, contained in seman-
tic annotations, may effectively be used to resolve ambiguities and to nar-
row down underspecified meanings, by exploiting their semantics. We have
thereby assumed that the annotations are expressed in an annotation lan-
guage that has a formal semantics. This is often not the case, but under
the influence of efforts of the international organisation for standards ISO,
projects are under way that do indeed aim to define such annotation lan-
guages, and preliminary studies by Pratt-Hartmann, Katz, Lee, and the au-
thor have demonstrated the feasibility of doing so for substantial fragments
of semantic annotation languages.
This approach opens the possibility to exploit semantic annotations in a
computational interpretation process, as we have shown by casting the in-
terpretation of semantic annotations in a UDRS-like representation format
that is also suitable for underspecified semantic representation, allowing
fairly straightforward unification to combine the information from annota-
tions with that obtained through local, compositional semantic analysis.
Is this useful? Isn’t the (automatic) construction of the semantic anno-
tations the most difficult part of the interpretation enterprise, rather than
something that’s waiting to be exploited? Maybe so; that depends very
much on the kind of linguistic material to be interpreted and on the kinds
of semantic information that annotations aim to capture. One thing is
clear: semantic annotations are constructed using entirely different tech-
niques (machine learning from corpora, exploitation of domain ontologies,
searching metadata,..) than the compositional syntactic-semantic analysis
techniques that make the semantic content at sentence level explicit. The
approach that we have outlined here makes it possible to effectively combine
such very heterogeneous processes and sources of information.

<abstract confidence="0.9994791">This paper presents a new perspective on the use of semantic annotations. We argue that semantic annotations should (1) capture semantic information that is complimentary to the information that is expressed in the source text; (2) have a formal interpretation. If these conditions are fullfilled, then the information in semantic annotations can be effectively combined with the information in the source text by interpreting a semantic annotation language through the translation of annotations into the same formalism as underspecified semantic representations obtained through compositional semantic analysis.</abstract>
