Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999889666666667">
Discourse in formal domains, such as mathematics,
is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic natu-
ral language and embedded (semi-)formal symbolic
mathematical expressions. Due to the lack of em-
pirical data, little is known about the suitability of
input analysis methods for mathematical discourse
in a dialog setting. We present an input understand-
ing method for a tutoring system teaching mathe-
matical theorem proving. The adopted deep anal-
ysis strategy is motivated by the complexity of the
language phenomena observed in a corpus collected
in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. Our goal is a uni-
form input interpretation, in particular, considering
different degrees of formality of natural language
verbalizations.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998345">
In the DIALOG&apos; project (Benzm¨uller et al., 2003a),
we are investigating and modeling semantic and
pragmatic phenomena in tutorial dialogs focused on
problem solving skills in mathematics. Our goal is
(i) to empirically investigate the use of flexible natu-
ral language dialog in tutoring mathematics, and (ii)
to develop a dialog-based tutoring system for teach-
ing mathematical theorem proving. The experimen-
tal system will engage in a dialog in written natural
language to help a student understand and construct
mathematical proofs. In this paper, we address a
strategy for user input interpretation in our setting.
Because of the lack of empirical dialog-data on
the use of natural language in formal domains, such
as mathematics, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz ex-
periment to collect a corpus of dialogs with a sim-
ulated system teaching proofs in naive set theory.
An investigation of the corpus reveals language phe-
nomena that present challenges to the existing com-
monly used input understanding methods. The chal-

lenges lie in (i) the tight interleaving of natural and
symbolic language, (ii) varying degree of natural
language verbalization of the formal mathematical
content, and (iii) informal and/or imprecise refer-
ence to mathematical concepts and relations.
These phenomena motivate the use of deep syn-
tactic and semantic analysis of user input. We de-
veloped a grammar that allows a uniform treatment
of the linguistic content on a par with the math-
ematical content and thus supports analysis of in-
puts of different degrees of verbalization. We em-
ploy a domain-motivated semantic lexicon to medi-
ate between the domain-independent semantic rep-
resentation obtained through semantic construction
during parsing and domain-specific interpretation.
This serves to achieve a consistent semantic anal-
ysis while avoiding example-based heuristics.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2,
we present the setup of the system and the corpus
collection experiment. In Sect. 3 and show exam-
ples of language phenomena from our dialogs. In
Sect. 4, we first summarize the approach to pars-
ing the mixed symbolic and natural language in-
put and then present a lexical-semantic interface to
a domain-specific interpretation of the input. We
show example analyzes in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6,
we summarize relevant existing approaches to input
analysis in (tutorial) dialog systems on the one hand
and analysis of mathematical discourse on the other.
Sect. 7 is the conclusion.

In order to empirically investigate the use of nat-
ural language in mathematics tutoring, we collected
and analyzed a corpus of dialogs with a simulated
tutoring system.
24 subjects with varying educational background
and little/fair prior mathematical knowledge partic-
ipated in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Benzm¨uller et
al., 2003b). The experiment consisted of 3 phases:
(i) preparation and pre-test (on paper), (ii) tutor-
ing session (mediated by a WOz tool (Fiedler and
Gabsdil, 2002)), (iii) post-test and evaluation ques-
tionnaire (on paper). At the tutoring session, they
were asked to prove 3 theorems3: (i) K((A U B) n
(C U D)) = (K(A) n K(B)) U (K(C) n K(D));
(ii) A n B E P((A U C) n (B U C)); (iii) If
A C_ K(B), then B C_ K(A). The subjects were
instructed to enter proof steps, rather than complete
proofs at once, to encourage interaction with the
system. The subjects and the tutor were free in for-
mulating their turns.4

The collected corpus consists of 66 dialog log-
files, containing on average 12 turns. The total num-
ber of sentences is 1115, of which 393 are student
sentences. The students’ turns consisted on aver-
age of 1 sentence, the tutor’s of 2. More details on
the corpus itself and annotation efforts that guide
the development of the system components can be

<bodyText confidence="0.9976705">
In this section, we present an overview of the lan-
guage phenomena prominent in the collected di-
alogs to indicate the overall complexity of input un-
derstanding in our setting.5
Interleaved natural language and formulas The
following examples illustrate how the mathematical
language, often semi-formal, is interleaved with the
natural language informally verbalizing proof steps.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.49297725">
A auch  K(B) [Aalso  K(B)]
AB ist  von C(AB) [... is  of ...]

B enthaelt kein xA [B contains no xA]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999796">
The mixture affects the way parsing needs to be
conducted: mathematical content has to be identi-
fied before it is interpreted within the utterance. In
particular, mathematical objects (or parts thereof)
may lie within the scope of quantifiers or negation
expressed in natural language (as in the last example
above).
Imprecise or informal naming Domain relations
and concepts are described informally using impre-
cise and/or ambiguous expressions.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.807465444444444">
A enthaelt B [A contains B]
A muss in B sein [A must be in B]
B vollstaendig ausserhalb von A liegen muss, also im
Komplement von A
[B has to be entirely outside ofA, so in the complement ofA]
dann sind A und B (vollkommen) verschieden, haben keine
gemeinsamen Elemente
[then A and B are (completely) different, have no common
elements]
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947239">
In the above examples, contain and be in can ex-
press domain relations of (strict) subset or element,
while be outside of and be different are informal
descriptions of the empty intersection of sets.
To handle imprecision and informality, we have
designed an ontological knowledge base that in-
cludes domain-specific interpretations of concep-
tual relations that have corresponding formal coun-
terparts in the domain of naive set theory.
The dialogs were typed in German.

Metonymy Metonymic expressions are used to
refer to structural sub-parts of formulas, resulting
in predicate structures acceptable informally, yet in-
compatible in terms of selection restrictions.

there, and so an element of it]

TERM or FORMULA, rather than LOCATION;

ate formal operation is performed. The meaning of
the “action verbs” is needed for the interpretation of
the intended proof-step.

This class of referring expressions includes also
references to structural parts of terms and formu-
las such as “the left side” or “the inner parenthe-
sis” which are incomplete specifications: the former
refers to a part of a formula, the latter, metonymic,
to an expression enclosed in parenthesis. More-
over, they require discourse referents for sub-parts
of mathematical expressions to be available.

Co-reference phenomena specific to informal
mathematical discourse involve (parts of) mathe-
matical expressions within text. In particular, enti-
ties denoted with the same literals may not co-refer,
as in the second utterance.
In the next section, we present the input interpre-
tation procedure up to the level of lexical-semantic
interpretation. We concentrate on the interface be-
tween the linguistic meaning representation (ob-
tained from the parser) and the representation of
domain-knowledge (encoded in a domain ontol-
ogy), which we realize through a domain-motivated
semantic lexicon.

4 Interpretation strategy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982391416666666">
The task of the input interpretation component is
two-fold. Firstly, it is to construct a representation
of the utterance’s linguistic meaning. Secondly, it is
to identify within the utterance, separate, and con-
struct interpretations of:
(i) parts which constitute meta-communication
with the tutor (e.g., “Ich habe die Aufgaben-
stellung nicht verstanden.” [I don’t understand
what the task is.] that are not to be processed
by the domain reasoner; and
(ii) parts which convey domain knowledge that
should be verified by a domain reasoner; for
example, the entire utterance “K((A U B)) ist
laut deMorgan-1 K(A) n K(B)” [... is, ac-
cording to deMorgan-1,...] can be evaluated
in the context of the proof being constructed;
on the other hand, the reasoner’s knowledge
base does not contain appropriate representa-
tions to evaluate the appropriateness of the fo-
cusing particle “also” in “Wenn A = B, dann ist
A auch C K(B) und B C K(A).” [IfA = B,
then A is also C K(B) and B C K(A).].

relevant parts of the input are further processed by

Proof Manager, a component that directly commu-
nicates with a domain-reasoner7. The task of the
Proof Manager is to: (i) build and maintain a repre-
sentation of the proof constructed by the student;8
(ii) check appropriateness of the interpretation(s)
found by the input understanding module with the
state of the proof constructed so far; (iii) given the
current proof state, evaluate the utterance with re-
spect to soundness, relevance, and completeness.
The semantic analysis proceeds in 2 stages:
(i) After standard pre-processing9, mathematical
expressions are identified, analyzed, catego-
rized, and substituted with default lexicon en-
tries encoded in the grammar. The input is then
syntactically parsed, and an formal abstract
representation of its meaning is constructed
compositionally along with the parse;
(ii) The obtained meaning representation is subse-
quently merged with discourse context and in-
terpreted by consulting a semantic lexicon of
the domain and a domain-specific ontology.
In the next sections, we first briefly summa-
rize the syntactic and semantic parsing part of the
input understanding process10 and show the for-
mat of meaning encoding constructed at this stage
(Sect. 4.1). Then, we show the lexical-semantic in-
terface to the domain ontology (Sect. 4.2).

4.1 Linguistic Meaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97982">
By linguistic meaning (LM), we understand the
dependency-based deep semantics in the sense of
the Prague School sentence meaning as employed in
the Functional Generative Description (FGD) (Sgall
et al., 1986; Kruijff, 2001). It represents the lit-
eral meaning of the utterance rather than a domain-
specific interpretation.11 In FGD, the central frame
unit of a sentence/clause is the head verb which
specifies the tectogrammatical relations (TRs) of

level proving (Vo et al., 2003)

<footnote confidence="0.988701266666666">
8The discourse content representation is separated from the
proof representation, however, the corresponding entities must
be co-indexed in both.
9Standard pre-processing includes sentence and word to-
kenization, (spelling correction and) morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging.
10We are concentrating on syntactically well-formed utter-
ances. In this paper, we are not discussing ways of combin-
ing deep and shallow processing techniques for handling mal-
formed input.
11LM is conceptually related to logical form, however, dif-
fers in coverage: while it does operate on the level of deep
semantic roles, such aspects of meaning as the scope of quan-
tifiers or interpretation of plurals, synonymy, or ambiguity are
not resolved.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978725">
its dependents (participants). Further distinction is
drawn into inner participants, such as Actor, Pa-
tient, Addressee, and free modifications, such as Lo-
cation, Means, Direction. Using TRs rather than
surface grammatical roles provides a generalized
view of the correlations between the conceptual
content of an utterance and its linguistic realization.
At the pre-processing stage, mathematical ex-
pressions embedded within input are identified, ver-
ified as to syntactic validity, categorized, and sub-
stituted with default lexical entries encoded in the
parser grammar for mathematical expression cate-
gories. For example, the expression K((A U B) n
(C U D)) = (K(A U B) n K(C U D)) given its top
node operator, =, is of type formula, its “left side”
is the expression K((A U B) n (C U D)), the list
of bracketed sub-expressions includes: AUB, CUD,
(A U B) n (C U D), etc.
Next, the pre-processed input is parsed with
a lexically-based syntactic/semantic parser built
on Multi-Modal Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mar (Baldridge, 2002; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003).
The task of the deep parser is to produce an FGD-
based linguistic meaning representation of syntac-
tically well-formed sentences and fragments. The
linguistic meaning is represented in the formalism
of Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics. Details on
the semantic construction in this formalism can be
found in (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).
To derive our set of TRs we generalize and sim-
plify the collection of Praguian tectogrammatical
relations from (Hajiˇcov´a et al., 2000). One rea-
son for simplification is to distinguish which re-
lations are to be understood metaphorically given
the domain-specific sub-language. The most com-
monly occurring relations in our context (aside from
the roles of Actor and Patient) are Cause, Condi-
tion, and Result-Conclusion (which coincide with
the rhetorical relations in the argumentative struc-
ture of the proof):

the meaning contain and in this frame takes de-
pendents in the relations Actor and Patient, shown
schematically in Fig. 2 (FORMULA represents the
default lexical entry for the identified mathematical
expressions categorized as formulas). The linguis-

obtains the following representation:

Patient, respectively.

leaved natural and symbolic expressions can be

togrammatical relations that build up linguistic
meaning of informal mathematical text can be found

4.2 Conceptual Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867611111111">
At the final stage of input understanding, the lin-
guistic meaning representations obtained from the
parser are interpreted with respect to the given
domain. We encode information on the domain-
specific concepts and relations in a domain ontol-
ogy that reflects the knowledge base of the domain-
reasoner, and which is augmented to allow res-
olution of ambiguities introduced by natural lan-
guage (Horacek and Wolska, 2004). We interface
to the domain ontology through an upper-level on-
tology of concepts at the lexical-semantics level.
Domain specializations of conceptual relations
are encoded in the domain ontology, while a seman-
tic lexicon assigns conceptually-oriented semantics
in terms of linguistic meaning frames and provides a
link to the domain interpretation(s) through the do-
main ontology. Lexical semantics in combination
with the knowledge encoded in the ontology allows
us to identify those parts of utterances that have an
interpretation in the given domain. Moreover, pro-
ductive rules for treatment of metonymic expres-
sions are encoded through instantiation of type com-
patible concepts. If more than one lexical-semantic
interpretation is plausible, no disambiguation is per-
formed. Alternative conceptual representations are
further interpreted using the domain ontology, and
passed on to the Proof Manager for evaluation. Be-
low we explain some of the entries the semantic lex-
icon encodes:
Containment The Containment relation special-
izes into the domain relations of (strict) SUB-
SET and ELEMENT. Linguistically, it can be re-
alized, among others, with the verb “enthalten”
(“contain”). The tectogrammatical frame of
“enthalten” involves the roles of Actor (ACT)
and Patient (PAT):

<equation confidence="0.9997245">
contain(ACTtype:F ORMULA, PATtype:FORMULA) -

contain(ACTtype:OBJECT , PATtype:OBJECT ) -
CONTAINMENT(containerACT , containeePAT )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999135">
Location The Location relation, realized linguisti-
cally by the prepositional phrase introduced by
“in”, involves the tectogrammatical relations
HasProperty-Location (LOC) and the Actor of
the predicate “sein”. We consider Location
in our domain as synonymous with Contain-
ment. Another realization of this relation, dual
to the above, occurs with the adverbial phrase
“außerhalb von ...(liegen)” (“lie outside of”)
and is defined as negation of Containment:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992884">
in(ACTtype:OBJECT ,LOCtype:OBJECT )
- CONTAINMENT(containerLOC , containeeACT )
outside(ACTtype:OBJECT ,LOCtype:OBJECT )
- not(in(ACTtype:OBJECT ,LOCtype:OBJECT ))

<bodyText confidence="0.9841505">
Common property A general notion of “common
property” we define as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.786273">
common(Property, ACTplural(A:SET,B:SET))
- Property(p1, A) A Property(p1, B)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.963590625">
Property is a meta-object that can be instanti-
ated with any relational predicate, for example
as in “(A und B)&lt;ACT&gt; haben (gemeinsame
Elemente)&lt;PAT&gt;” (“A and B have common
elements”):
common(ELEMENT, ACTplural(A:SET,B:SET))
- ELEMENT(p1 ,A) A ELEMENT(p1 , B)
Difference The Difference relation, realized
linguistically by the predicates “verschieden
(sein)” (“be different”; for COLLECTION or
STRUCTURED OBJECTS) and “disjunkt (sein)”
(“be disjoint”; for objects of type COLLEC-
TION) involves a plural Actor (e.g. coordinated
noun phrases) and a HasProperty TRs. De-
pending on the type of the entity in the Actor
relation, the interpretations are:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.995971428571429">
different(ACTplural(A:SET,B:SET)) - A =� B
different(ACTplural(A:SET,B:SET))

different(ACTplural(A:STRUCTUREDOBJECT
,B:STRUCTUREDOBJECT))
- (Property1(p1, A) A Property2(p2, B) A
Property1 = Property2 =:&gt;. p1 =� p2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947314">
Mereological relations Here, we encode part-
of relations between domain objects. These
concern both physical surface and ontologi-
cal properties of objects. Commonly occurring
part-of relations in our domain are:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6097535">
hasComponent(STRUCTURED OBJECTterm,formula ,
STRUCTURED OBJECTSUBTERM,SUBFORMULA)
hasComponent(STRUCTURED OBJECTterm,formula ,

hasComponent(STRUCTURED OBJECTterm,formula ,
STRUCTURED
OBJECTT ERMCOMP ONENT,FORMULACOMP ONENT )

Moreover, from the ontology we have:

Property(STRUCTURED OBJECTterm,formula ,
componentterm−side,formula−side)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975476190476">
Using these definitions and polysemy rules
such as polysemous(Object, Property), we can
obtain interpretation of utterances such as
“Dann gilt f¨ur die linke Seite, ...” (“Then
for the left side it holds that ... ”) where the
predicate “gilt” normally takes two arguments
of types STRUCTURED OBJECTterm,formula,
rather than an argument of type Property.
For example, the previously mentioned predicate
contain (Fig. 2) represents the semantic relation of
Containment which, in the domain of naive set the-
ory, is ambiguous between the domain relations EL-
EMENT, SUBSET, and PROPER SUBSET. The al-
ternative specializations are encoded in the domain
ontology, while the semantic lexicon provides the
conceptual structure of the head predicate. At the
domain interpretation stage, the semantic lexicon is
consulted to translate the tectogrammatical frame of
the predicate into a semantic relation represented
in the domain ontology. For the predicate contain,
from the semantic lexicon, we obtain:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.628775">

<bodyText confidence="0.744659">

- CONTAINMENT�ontainerACT , containeeP AT )
[’the Containment relation involves a predicate contain and its Actor
and Patient dependents, where the Actor and Patient are the container
and containee parameters respectively’]
Translation rules that consult the domain ontology
expand the conceptual structure representation into
alternative domain-specific interpretations preserv-
ing argument structure. As it is in the capacity of
neither sentence-level nor discourse-level analysis
to evaluate the appropriateness of the alternative in-
terpretations in the proof context, this task is dele-
gated to the Proof Manager.

<bodyText confidence="0.967703913043478">
In this section, we illustrate the mechanics of the
approach on the following example:
A enthaelt keinesfalls Elemente, die auch in B sind.
[A contains no elements that are also in B]
The analysis proceeds as follows.
The mathematical expression tagger first iden-
tifies the expressions A and B. If there was no
prior discourse entity for “A” and “B” to verify
their types, they are ambiguous between constant,
term, and formula12. The expressions are substi-
tuted with generic entries FORMULA, TERM, CONST
represented in the parser grammar. The sentence is
assigned alternative readings: “CONST contains no
elements that are also in CONST”, “CONST contains
no elements that are also in TERM”, “CONST con-
tains no elements that are also in FORMULA”, etc.
Here, we continue only with “CONST contains no
elements that are also in CONST”; the other readings
would be discarded at later stages of processing be-
cause of sortal incompatibilities.
The linguistic meaning of the utterance obtained
from the parser is represented by the following for-
mula13:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9036808">
@n1(no A &lt;Restr&gt;e1 A
&lt;Body&gt;(p1 A contain A &lt;ACT&gt;(a1 A A) A &lt;PAT&gt; e1)) A
@e1(element A
&lt;GenRel&gt;(b1 A be A &lt;ACT&gt;e1 A &lt;HasProp-Loc&gt;(b2 A B)))
[‘(set) A contains no elements that are in (set) B’]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997953833333333">
Next, the semantic lexicon is consulted to trans-
late the linguistic meaning representation into a con-
ceptual structure. The relevant lexical semantic en-
tries are Containment and Location (see Sect. 4.2).
The transformation is presented schematically be-
low:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.805128">
contain(ACTOBJECT :A, PATOBJECT:element) -
CONTAINMENT(containerA , containeeelement)
(ACTOBJECT :element, HasProp-LocOBJECT:B)
- CONTAINMENT(containerB , containeeelement)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997727833333333">
Finally, in the domain ontology, we find that the
conceptual relation of Containment, in naive set the-
ory, specializes into the domain relations of ELE-
MENT, SUBSET, STRICT SUBSET. Using the lin-
guistic meaning, the semantic lexicon, and the do-
main ontology, we obtain all the combinations of
interpretations, including the target one paraphrased
below:
’it is not the case that there exist elements e, such that e E A and e E B’,
Using translation rules the final interpretations
are translated into first-order logic formulas and
passed on for evaluation to the Proof Manager.

Language understanding in dialog systems, be it
with speech or text interface, is commonly per-
formed using shallow syntactic analysis combined
12In prior discourse, there may have been an assignment
A := 0, where 0 is a formula, in which case, A would be known
from discourse context to be of type FORMULA (similarly for
term assignment); by CONST we mean a set or element variable
such as A, x denoting a set A or an element x respectively.

with keyword spotting. Tutorial systems also suc-
cessfully employ statistical methods which com-
pare student responses to a model built from pre-
constructed gold-standard answers (Graesser et al.,
2000). This is impossible for our dialogs, due to
the presence of symbolic mathematical expressions
and because of such aspects of discourse meaning
as causal relations, modality, negation, or scope
of quantifiers which are of crucial importance in
our setting, but of which shallow techniques remain
oblivious (or handle them in a rudimentary way).
When precise understanding is needed, tutorial sys-
tems use closed-questions to elicit short answers of
little syntactic variation (Glass, 2001) or restricted
format of input is allowed. However, this conflicts
with the preference for flexible dialog do achieve
active learning (Moore, 1993).
With regard to interpreting mathematical
texts, (Zinn, 1999) and (Baur, 1999) present DRT
analyzes of course-book proofs. The language in
our dialogs is more informal: natural language and
symbolic mathematical expressions are mixed more
freely, there is a higher degree and more variety
of verbalization, and mathematical objects are not
properly introduced. Both above approaches rely on
typesetting information that identifies mathematical
symbols, formulas, and proof steps, whereas our
input does not contain any such information.
Forcing the user to delimit formulas would not
guarantee a clean separation of the natural language
and the non-linguistic content, while might reduce
the flexibility of the system by making the interface
harder to use.

7 Conclusion and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975078947368">
In this paper, we reported on the use of deep syn-
tactic and semantic analysis in the interpretation
of mathematical discourse in a dialog setting. We
presented an approach that uses domain-motivated
semantic lexicon to mediate between a domain-
independent representation of linguistic meaning of
utterances and their domain-specific interpretation.
We are incrementally extending the coverage of
the deep analysis components. Our current parser
grammar and upper-level ontology cover most of
the constructions and concepts that occur most fre-
quently in our corpus. The module will be evaluated
as part of the next Wizard-of-Oz experiment.
We are planning to investigate the possibility
of using FrameNet resources developed within the
SALSA project (Erk et al., 2003) at the intermedi-
ate interpretation stage between the linguistic mean-
ing and domain-specific interpretation. Presently,
the semantic lexicon we have constructed encodes,
for instance, a general conceptual relation of CON-
TAINMENT evoked by the verb “enthalten” (“con-
tain”), with dependents in relations Actor and Pa-
tient, which corresponds to the FrameNet CON-
TAINING domain with frame elements CONTAINER
and CONTENTS. In the course of further work, we
would like to investigate ways of establishing inter-
face between the linguistic meaning TRs and frame
elements, and attempt to use FrameNet to interpret
predicates unknown to our semantic lexicon. Tak-
ing a hypothetical example, if our parser grammar
encoded the meaning of the verb “beinhalten” (with
the intended meaning contain) in the same linguis-
tic meaning frame as “enthalten” (contain), while
the sense of “beinhalten” were not explicitly defined
in the semantic lexicon, we could attempt to inter-
pret it using the FrameNet CONTAINING domain
and the existing lexical semantic entry for “enthal-
ten”.

<abstract confidence="0.9970248125">Discourse in formal domains, such as mathematics, is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic natural language and embedded (semi-)formal symbolic mathematical expressions. Due to the lack of empirical data, little is known about the suitability of input analysis methods for mathematical discourse in a dialog setting. We present an input understanding method for a tutoring system teaching mathematical theorem proving. The adopted deep analysis strategy is motivated by the complexity of the language phenomena observed in a corpus collected a Our goal is a uniform input interpretation, in particular, considering different degrees of formality of natural language verbalizations.</abstract>

In order to empirically investigate the use of natural language in mathematics tutoring, we collected and analyzed a corpus of dialogs with a simulated tutoring system. 24 subjects with varying educational background and little/fair prior mathematical knowledge participated in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Benzm¨uller et al., 2003b). The experiment consisted of 3 phases: (i) preparation and pre-test (on paper), (ii) tutoring session (mediated by a WOz tool (Fiedler and Gabsdil, 2002)), (iii) post-test and evaluation questionnaire (on paper).

We encode information on the domainspecific concepts and relations in a domain ontology that reflects the knowledge base of the domainreasoner, and which is augmented to allow resolution of ambiguities introduced by natural language (Horacek and Wolska, 2004). We interface to the domain ontology through an upper-level ontology of concepts at the lexical-semantics level. Domain specializations of conceptual relations are encoded in the domain ontology, while a semantic lexicon assigns conceptually-oriented semantics in terms of linguistic meaning frames and provides a link to the domain interpretation(s) through the domain ontology. Lexical semantics in combination with the knowledge encoded in the ontology allows us to identify those parts of utterances that have an interpretation in the given domain.

It represents the literal meaning of the utterance rather than a domainspecific interpretation.11 In FGD, the central frame unit of a sentence/clause is the head verb which specifies the tectogrammatical relations (TRs) of 7We are using a version of OMEGA adapted for assertionlevel proving (Vo et al., 2003) 8The discourse content representation is separated from the proof representation, however, the corresponding entities must be co-indexed in both. 9Standard pre-processing includes sentence and word tokenization, (spelling correction and) morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging. 10W</context>
