<bodyText confidence="0.999234714285714">
Language documentation is important as a tool
for preservation of endangered languages and
making data available to speakers and
researchers of a language. A data base such as
TypeCraft is important for typology studies both
for well documented languages as well as little
documented languages and is a valid tool for
comparison of languages. This requires that
linguistic elements must be coded in a manner
that allows comparability across widely varying
language data. In this paper, I discuss how I
have used the coding system in TypeCraft for
the documentation of data from Èdó language, a
language belonging to the Edoid group of the
Benue-Congo subfamily of the Volta-Congo
language family and spoken in Mid-Western
Nigeria, West Africa. The study shows how
syntactic, semantic and morphological
properties of multi-verb constructions in Èdó
(Benue-Congo) can be represented in a
relational database.

In this paper1, I show some ways in which I am
using a shared methodology in my research on
multi-verb constructions. My research is
centered around the language Èdó, spoken in
Mid-Western Nigeria, Ga and Akan (kwa), and
the tool is the system TypeCraft, which has
been developed in the ISK department, NTNU
and first documented in Beermann and Prange
(2006).

language family consists of 33 languages and
19 of these languages have either very little
documentation or no documentation available.
Multi-verb constructions are constructions
in which the verbs in series must function as
independent verbs in simple constructions,
with at least one shared argument and no
marking of syntactic dependency.
The paper shows how syntactic, semantic
and morphological properties of multi-verb
constructions in Èdó (Benue-Congo) can be
represented in a relational database and the
development of annotation standards that
contribute to contrastive and typological
research. The analysis is extended to multi-
verb constructions in the following languages
of the Niger-Congo: Ga and Akan (Kwa).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987341">
TypeCraft is a tool for typological analysis that
allows for annotation, classification and search
of data along different morphological,
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic criteria. In
annotating it is important to have annotation
schemes that allow for typological and
contrastive studies.
In this paper I use an annotation scheme
for verbal constructions currently being
developed at NTNU and documented in Hellan
and Dakubu (2009). Syntactic and semantic
information about construction types are
provided by templates composed by labels.
The basic structural parts of a template are
referred to as slots that are separated by
hyphens. A template with a verbal head can
consist of maximal 7 slots; (1) POS of the
head, and diathesis information; (2) valence
specification; (3) dependent specification; (4)
participant roles; (5) aspect and aktionsart; (6)

situation type; (7) provides a linking type
between slot 6 situation type and the
specifications in slots 2-4. Slots 1 and 2 are
obligatorily filled, the others not. (cf. Hellan
and Dakubu, 2009). At present annotation of
the construction labels is manual and not
incorporated into the TypeCraft. However
TypeCraft provides a construction tier where
this information can be incorporated.

TypeCraft provides a set of glosses for
syntactic and semantic coding and a set of
parameters along which sentences may be
classified that allow for standardized
annotation and cross linguistic comparison as
illustrated in figure1:

Word level annotation allows for analysis of
predicates in terms of syntactic and semantic
properties including information about the
subcategorization properties and argument
structure of predicates.

Type craft features 7 tiers that provide
information at the word level as shown in the
Èdó example below.

The construction labels are explained as
follows: v in Slot1 in the example above states
that the head of the construction is a verb. tr in
Slot2 states that the verb is transitive,
suAg_obThincrem in Slot 4 states that the NP
that is the subject of the construction bears an
agent theta role and the object an incremental
theme theta role. Lastly slot 5 gives the
information that the aktionsart of the
construction is completed monodevelopment.

TypeCraft provides a set of global tags at the
sentence level that allows for classification in
terms of syntactic and semantic automatically
generated construction parameters such as
constituent type, core constituent vs adjunct,
transitivity, thematic roles, situation and aspect
types, propositional types and polarity. Polarity
is based on the assumption that States Of
Affairs (SOA) comes in pairs: positive and
negative. Figure 3 is used as illustration:

<bodyText confidence="0.9705962">
The construction parameter is
explained as follows: the global tags multiple
predicate kernel -SVC- provides information
about constituent type, achievement provides
information about situation and aspect types,
declarative provides information about
propositional types and positive about polarity.
The construction labels have the
following structure: Area1 (in italics for ease
of exposition) gives the global labels, the
number of verbs in series (ie sv, sv3, sv4 ) as
well as argument sharing information (coded
by the label IDALL) and information about
thematic relations holding across the verb in
series. Area 2 gives the valence information as
well as information about grammatical
function and thematic roles (underlined for
ease of exposition). Information about the
situation type of the construction is provided
by Area 3 and is written in capital letters.
Information about tense, aspect, mood
and negation is also provided by area 1 in the
construction labels. Sharing of these features
across verbs in series is represented as with
sharing of arguments as in example (3) from
Akan below.

With respect to the global labels in area 1,
Hellan and Dakubu (2009) uses also the global
label ev to represent Extended Verb
Complexes and the label pv for preverbs in
EVCs. In addition, to the labeling conventions
used by Hellan and Dakubu (2009) for SVCs
(sv) and EVCs (ev, pv), the following global
labels are introduced to account for the range
of multi-verb constructions in my data.

TypeCraft allows for search using different
word level and sentence level parameters. This
facilitates comparative analysis in multi-verb
constructions. For example, argument sharing
is a property that identifies types of multi-verb
constructions. A search using the construction
label svsuObIDALL is used as illustration. The
result gives an output of serial verb
constructions in Èdó and Ga consisting of two
verbs in series with the subject and object
arguments of the verbs in series sharing
reference:
The standardized annotation, search
parameters and online nature of TypeCraft
makes it advantageous compared to toolbox, a
linguistic data management file based system
used by many linguists in the documentation of
African languages.

Standardized annotations and online databases
such as TypeCraft aid linguists and speakers of
a language in research, preservation of
languages and in producing literacy materials
that aid education and literacy. My research on
multi-verb constructions in Èdó is the first in-
depth annotation for Èdó and will be easily
available for language
researchers/teachers/students all over the
world.
