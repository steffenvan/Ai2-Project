A user-friendly interface to search bilingual
resources is of great help to NLP developers as
well as pure-linguists. Using bilingual re-
sources is difficult for linguists who are unfa-
miliar with computation, which hampers capa-
bilities of bilingual resources. NLP developers
sometimes need a kind of workbench to check
their resources. The online interface this paper
introduces can satisfy these needs. In order to
implement the interface, this research deals
with how to align Korean and Japanese phras-
es and interpolates them into the original bi-
lingual corpus in an automatic way.

<bodyText confidence="0.947462852941177">
Bilingual or multilingual corpora are significant
language resources in various language studies,
such as language education, comparative linguis-
tics, in particular, NLP. What holds the key posi-
tion in bilingual resources is how to align lin-
guistic units between two languages. In this con-
text, three fundamental questions about how to
harness bilingual resources can be raised; (i)
which linguistic unit or level should correspond
to those in the corresponding language? (ii)
which method should be employed for align-
ment? (iii) which environments should be pre-
pared for users?
This paper covers these matters related to bi-
lingual resources and their use. The language
resource that this paper handles is the Sejong Ko-
rean-Japanese Bilingual Corpus (henceforth
SKJBC).1 The original version of the SKJBC,
constructed in a XML format, aligns sentence by

sentence or paragraph by paragraph. This re-
search re-organizes and re-aligns the original
version using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and
Moses (Koehn et al. 2007), and interpolates the
aligning information into each original file auto-
matically. Turning to the interface, this research
converts the whole data into a database system
(MySQL) to guarantee data integrity. Building
on the database, this research implements an on-
line search system accessible without any restric-
tions; dubbed NARA2.

2 The SKJBC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999495">
The SKJBC had been constructed as a subset of
the Sejong project3 which had been carried out
from 1998 to 2007, sponsored by the Korean
government. The SKJBC is divided into two
parts; one is the raw corpus annotated only with
sentence aligning indices, the other is the POS-
tagged corpus, in which the tag set for Korean
complies with the POS-tagging guideline of the
Sejong project, and the morphological analysis
for Japanese is based on ChaSen (Matsumoto et
al., 1999). This paper is exclusively concerned
with the latter, because it is highly necessary for
the phrase alignment to make use of well-
segmented and well-refined data. Table 1 illu-
strates the basic configuration of the SKJBC.
Since the prime purpose of the Sejong project
was to build up balanced corpora, the SKJBC
consists of various genres, as shown in Figure 1.
This makes a clear difference from other bilin-
gual resources where the data-type is normally
homogeneous (e.g. newspapers). Moreover, since
it had been strictly prohibited to manipulate the

anese. It is a local name in Japan; it also means ‘a country’
in Korean. Since the name can properly stands for this re-
search’s goal, the name has been used as a project title.

original source for any reasons, the data in
SKJBC fully reflect on the real usage of Korean.
These characteristics, however, sometimes work
against computational implementation. Bi-texts
do not always correspond to each other sentence
by sentence; we can find out that there are a
number of cases that a sentence matches two or
more sentences in the other language or the cor-
responding sentences might be non-existent. In
other words, it is almost impossible to align all
the sentences only one-to-one. These cases even-
tually produce the multiple-to-multiple alignment,
unless annotators discard or separate them artifi-
cially. No artificial manipulation was allowed
under construction, the SKJBC contains quite a
few pairs in a multiple-to-multiple relation.

3 Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997901527777778">
This section is connected with the first question
raised in section 1; the proper level of alignment.
Most bilingual corpora, including the SKJBC,
have been constructed sentence by sentence de-
spite shortcomings, because it costs too much
time and effort to annotate word or phrase cor-
respondence by hand (Abeillé, 2003). To anno-
tate more specified alignment between two lan-
guages is to enhance the utility value of the re-
source; this research, first of all, considers how
to align at the level of word and phrase.
Multiple Alignments: Because of the prob-
lem mentioned in the previous section, the pairs
which do not match in a one-to-one relation were
excluded from the target of alignment. Through-
out a preliminary experiment, it was born out
that, if they remained, they led to a worse result.
After casting them away, the number of target
sentences is 3,776, which account for about 86
percent of the whole data.
Word vs. Phrase: To make the units equiva-
lent as far as possible is the crucial factor in
aligning as accurately as possible. One of the
main issues that should be taken into account in
aligning Korean and Japanese phrases is word
boundary. Though Korean and Japanese share
lots of features, the boundary of word or phrase
is inconsistent with each other. The general con-
cept to segment words in Korean is the so-called
ejeol, tantamount to word-spacing, whereas that
in Japanese is bunsetsu, what we say. The differ-
ence stems from the different writing style; Ko-
rean inserts spacing between words, while Japa-
nese seldom uses spacing. Consequently, each
word in Korean is virtually equivalent to a phras-
al unit in Japanese, as given in (1-2).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998735714285714">

(2) 笑っ 笑う/VIN
た た/AU
warat-ta
laugh-PAST ‘langhed’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992706904761905">
The first line (i.e. ejeol) in (1) for Korean corres-
ponds to the first and second line (i.e. bunsetsu)
in (2). Hence, it is the most suitable choice to
align Korean morphemes (e.g. 웃 wus) and Japa-
nese bunsetsu (e.g. 笑っ warat).
On the other hand, there is a clear cut between
lemmatized lexical forms and surface forms in
Japanese, (e.g. 笑う and 笑っ in the above, re-
spectively), whereas there is none in Korean. In
order to prevent the result from being biased, this
paper establishes two training sets (i.e. lemma-
tized and surface forms) for alignment.
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Other
than the above issues, it is also needed to consid-
er WSD. For example, a Korean word 삶 salm
has two meanings; one is ‘life’ as a nominal ex-
pression, the other is ‘boil’ as a verbal lexeme,
which correspond to 生 sei, 煮る niru, respec-
tively. This research, therefore, makes training
data composed of each morpheme plus its POS
tag, such as ‘삶/NNG’ and ‘生/NCPV’.

Turning to the second question, this part covers
how to align and annotate. Were it not for auto-
matic processing, it would be painstaking work
to construct bilingual resources even line by line.
One popular toolkit to align linguistic units be-

tween two languages in an unsupervised way is
GIZA++.
Even though GIZA++ yields fairly good
‘word’ alignment, much remains still to be done.
For instance, those who want to study two or
more languages from a comparative stance are
certain to need syntactic data which offer more
information about language diversity than plain
word-mapping. Besides, Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) commonly runs under the
phrase-based model. This research employs the
Moses toolkit to establish phrase tables. The
baseline of this research is the factorless one with
a five-gram language model.
In order to measure the accuracy of alignment,
this research uses the BLEU scoring (Papineni et
al., 2002) which has been widely used for eva-
luating SMT, under the hypothesis that the
BLEU score denotes how well-established the
phrase table is. For the evaluation purpose, 500
sentences were selected from the SKJBC at ran-
dom, and tested within each SMT baseline, as
given in Table 2.

Korean and Japanese are typologically very
similar. In particular, they have very similar
word order, which makes them easy to align us-
ing GIZA++ and Moses. Therefore, we could ex-
pect the baselines to perform well, and Table 2
proves it. Table 2 indicates the baselines using
Japanese surface forms are slightly better than
those using lemmatized forms. The next step is
to confirm whether or not the baselines with POS
tags decrease performance. The last line in Table
2 implies it is not the case, there is a slight de-
cline.
Building on the last baselines, this research in-
terpolates word and phrase aligning information
into the original XML files as presented in (3-5),
which means ‘Then, you will be free’. Figure 2
represents how the online interface this paper
proposes handles (3-5).

Last but maybe the most important is a user-
friendly interface. Those who have a solid back-
ground in computation could take advantage of
computational surroundings (e.g. Moses). Most
linguists, however, are not aware of how to use
bilingual data so well. It might look uneasy or
even vague for them to harness bilingual re-
sources for their current research. That means, no
matter how good the bilingual resource is or no
matter how well-trained the word or phrase table
is, unless there is an available interface, the re-
source becomes no more than a very restricted
one for a small number of people. Bilingual re-
sources are not NLP-dominated ones, admitting
NLP developers employ them most widely. They
are also useful in doing comparative language
research, making learning materials, or even hu-
man translation. Since one of the easiest interface
in these days would be web-browsers, this re-
search provide a web-interface; NARA (ver. 2).4
The interface of NARA system looks like a
common search site (e.g. Google). A simple
search option takes a position on the front side,
assuming most of users are unfamiliar with lin-
guistic terms. On the other hand, advanced
search mode, as given in Figure 3, offers more
specialized search options. One can search by tag,
morpheme, or word with specific sub-options,
such as matching type. One can also select the
result format such as word, sentence, or span. In
order to compare the search result in various
ways, there are some configuration options, such
as search direction (i.e. KoJa or JaKo), genre,
source language, etc.

Focusing on the Sejong Korean Japanese Bilin-
gual Corpus (SKJBC), this paper covers three
matters about how to use and show bilingual re-
sources, and provides a user-friendly online in-
terface to search the SKJBC. The NARA inter-
face is applicable to any other bilingual resources
in further researches, because it has been de-
signed data-independently. We have already used
it for aligned Korean-English text.

This research re-organizes and re-aligns the original version using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and Moses (Koehn et al. 2007), and interpolates the aligning information into each original file automatically. Turning to the interface, this research converts the whole data into a database system (MySQL) to guarantee data integrity. Building on the database, this research implements an online search system accessible without any restrictions; dubbed NARA2. 2 The SKJBC The SKJBC had been constructed as a subset of the Sejong project3 which had been carried out from 1998 to 2007, sponsored by the Korean government. The SKJBC is divided into two parts; one is the raw corpus annotated only with sentence aligning indices, t</context>

The SKJBC is divided into two parts; one is the raw corpus annotated only with sentence aligning indices, the other is the POStagged corpus, in which the tag set for Korean complies with the POS-tagging guideline of the Sejong project, and the morphological analysis for Japanese is based on ChaSen (Matsumoto et al., 1999). This paper is exclusively concerned with the latter, because it is highly necessary for the phrase alignment to make use of wellsegmented and well-refined data. Table 1 illustrates the basic configuration of the SKJBC. Since the prime purpose of the Sejong project was to build up balanced corpora, the SKJBC consists of various genres, as shown in Figure 1. This makes a clear difference from other bilingual resources where the data-type is normally homogeneous (e.g. newspapers). Moreover, since it had been strictly prohibited to manipulate the 2 The name, NARA, has meanings in both Korean and</context>
