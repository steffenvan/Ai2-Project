<bodyText confidence="0.931739542857143">
While both theoretical and empirical studies of question-
answering have revealed the inadequacy of traditional definitions
of yes-no questions (YNQs), little progress has been made
toward a more satisfactory redefinition. This paper reviews the
limitations of several proposed revisions. It proposes a new
definition of YNQs based upon research on a type of
conversational implicature, termed here scalar
implieature, that helps define appropriate responses to YNQs.
By representing YNQs as scalar queries it is possible to support
a wider variety of system and user responses in a principled way.
I INTRODUCTION
If natural language interfaces to question-answering systems are
to support a broad range of responses to user queries, the way
these systems represent queries for response retrieval should be
reexamined. Theorists of question-answering commonly define
questions in terms of the set of all their possible (true) answers.
Traditionally, they have defined ges-no questions (YNQs) as
propositional questions (?P) or as a special type of
alternative question (?P V ?Q), in which the second alternative
is simply the negation of the first (?P V ?-sP). So &apos;Does Mary like
skiing?&apos; would be represented as ?like(Mary,skiing) or
?like(Mary,skiing) V ?-dike(Mary,skiing) and the range of
appropriate responses would be yes, no and, possibly, unknown.
However, both theoretical work and empirical studies of naturally
occurring question-answer exchanges have shown this approach to
be inadequate: Yes, no, and unknown form only a small portion of
the set of all appropriate responses to a YNQ. Furthermore, for
some YNQ&apos;s, none of these simple direct responses alone is.
appropriate.
While it is widely recognized (Hobbs, 1979, Pollack, 1982) that
indirect responses&apos; to YNQs represent an important option for
respondents in natural discourse, standard theories of question-
answering have not been revised accordingly. A practical
consequence surfaces when attempts are made to support indirect
responses to YNQs computationally. For lack of alternative
representations, question-answering systems which would permit
indirect responses must still represent YNQs as if the direct
responses were the &apos;norm&apos;, and then resort to ad hoe manipulations
to generate second-class &apos;indirect&apos; responses. thus perpetuating an
a.synitiletric distinction between &apos;direct&apos; and &apos;indirect&apos; responses.
However, research under way on how a type of generalized
conversational implicature, termed here scalar
implicature, can be used to guide the generation and
interpretion of indirect responses to YNQs suggests a revised
representation for YNQs which accontmodates a wide variety of
responses in a uniform way.
II CURRENT REPRESENTATIONS OF YNQS
Among standard aceounts of YNQs, Hintikka&apos;s (Ilintikk a. 1978)
is one of the simplest and most widely accepted, combining the
!Indirect responses to YNQs are definer&apos; here as responses other than yes,
no, or some expression of ignorance.
concepts of YNQ as propositional question and as alternative
question; as such, it will be used below to represent traditional
approaches in general. To define answerhood, the conditions
under which a response counts as an answer to a natural-language
query, Hintikka divides queries into two parts: an imperative or
optative operator (!), roughly expressing &apos;bring it about that&apos;, and
a desideratum, a specification of the epistemic state a questioner
desires. For Hintikka, a YNQ is a special case of alternative
question in which the negative alternative &apos;or not P&apos; has been
suppressed. So the desideratum of a YNQ is of the form (I know
that 14) V (/ know that ncg+P), where neg+ indicates the
negation-forming process. &apos;Does Mary like skiing?&apos; thus has as its
desideratum I know that Mary likes skiing or I know that Mary
does not like ekiing, or, more concisely, (ti slike(Alary,ekiin0 V
s—like( Mary,.?kiing). where Ks is the epistemie representation of
&apos;S knows that&apos;. The full sense of the query is then &apos;Bring it about
that I know that Mary likes skiing or that I know that Mary does
not like skiing&apos;, which can be represented by ! (If5/3 V Ks-■13).
Possible responses are simply (P,-,P), or (yes,no).

Bolinger (Bolinger, 1978) has called such interpretations into
question by showing that YNQs may have very different meanings
from their alternative-question counterparts; they also have more
restricted paraphrase and intonation patterns. In Bolinger&apos;s view
the term yes-no query has hypnotized scholars into assuming
that, simply because a class of question can be answered by a ves
or no, these alternatives are criterial, and every YNQ is intended
to elicit one or the other. He proposes instead that YNQs be
viewed as hypotheses pot forward for confirmation, amendment, or
discontinuation — in any degree. Thus, in Dolinger&apos;s exampie (1),
the

Similarly, Kiefer (Kiefer, 1980) points out evidence for the
inadequacy of the standard view of YNQs, but proposes no unified
solution. In a study of the indirect speech acts that may be
performed by YNQs, he notes that certain YNQs, which he terms
focussed YNQs, actually function as oh-questions. Focussed
YNQs for Kiefer are YNQs that are marked in some way
(apparently by stress) to indicate a background assumption
which Q and It typically share. For example, (5a) is not a
focussed YNQ while (sb)-(ral) are. While any of the four may be
answered with ;we or

no, it is also pos,:Me that, if Q asks (5b), she wants R to answer
the question &apos;When is John leaving for Stockholm?&apos;; if she asks (Sc)
she may want to know &apos;Where is John going tomorrow?&apos;; and if
she asks (5d) she may want to know &apos;Who is leaving for Stockholm
tomorrow?&apos; Thus a focussed YNQ resembles the wh-question that
might be formed by replacing the focussed element in the
desideratum with a corresponding Pro-element. In Kiefer&apos;s
analysis, only one element can be focussed, so responses such as
&apos;He&apos;s leaving for Paris Thursday&apos; will not be accommodated.
Although Kiefer does not propose a representation for focussed
YNQs, a disjunct resembling the desideratum of a wh-question
might be added to the traditional representation to accommodate
his third alternative: for (Sd) this might take the form &apos;Is John
leaving for Stockholm tomorrow, or, if not, who is!&apos; or, in
Hintikka&apos;s notation,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.970074666666667">

K -deaving(John,Stockholm,tornorrow) V
3x KQ leaving(x,Stockholm,tomorrow).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997393214285714">
This representation reflects another problem posed by Kiefer&apos;s
analysis: the third disjunct is appropriate only when the second
also is and not when the direct response yes is true. For example,
a response of &apos;Bill is&apos; to (5d) seems to convey that John is not
leaving for Stockholm tontorrow. Thus viewing some YNQs as
wh-rinestions requires a rather more complex representation than
simply adding a wh-question as a third disjunct.2 In addition,
defining different representations for various YNQ subtypes seems
a less than satisfactory solution to the limitations presented by
current representations of YNQs. A more unified solution to the
problems identified by Bolinger and Kiefer would clearly be
desirable. Such a solution is suggested by current research on the
role conversational implicature plays in accounting for indirect
responses to YNQs.

mushrooms that are not poisonous, even though 3x(mushroom(&apos;x)

Clearly &apos;Some are&apos; is an appropriate response to the query — more
appropriate in fact than a simple no, which might convey that no
mushrooms are poisonous — but what makes it appropriate?
Grice&apos;s (Once, 1975) Cooperative Principle claims that, without
contrary evidence, participants in conversation assume their
partners are trying to be cooperative. In consequence, they
recognize certain conversational maxims, such as Grice&apos;s Maxim

<bodyText confidence="0.913831428571429">
Speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual recognition of these maxims may give
rise to conversational implicatures: An utterance
conversationally implicates a proposition P when it conveys
P by virtue of the hearer&apos;s assumption of the speaker&apos;s
cooperativeness. While a speaker may not always obey these
maxims, the hearer&apos;s expectations are based on her belief that such
conventions represent the norm.

A. Scalar Predication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995417565217391">
Following Once, Horn (Horn, 1972) observed that, when a
speaker refers to a value on some scale defined by semantic
entailment&apos;&apos;, that value represents the highest value on its scale
the speaker can truthfully affirm. The speaker is saying as much
(Quantity) as she truthfully (Quality) can. Higher values on that
scale are thus implicitly marked by the speaker as not known to
be the case or known not to be the case.5 Values lower on the
scale will of course be marked as true, since they are entailed.
Horn called this phenomenon scalar predication, and
Gazdar (Gazdar, 1979) later used a variation as the basis for a
phenomenon he termed scalar quantity implicature. Here a
much revised and extended version will be termed scalar
implicature.
Horn&apos;s simple notion of scalar predication does provide a
principled ba.sis for interpreting (6) and similar indirect responses
to YNQs where scales are defined by entailment. Some is the
highest value on a quantifier scale that R can truthfully affirm.
Truth-values of higher scalars such as all are either unknown to R
or believed by him to be false. Thus, if Q recognizes R&apos;s
implicature, roughly, &apos;As far as I know, not all mushrooms are
poisonous&apos;, she will derive the direct response to her query as no or
I don&apos;t know. R must believe either that some mushrooms are not
poisonous or that some mushrooms may not be poisonous.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.980524333333333">
4W semantically entails T iff T is true whenever W is.
sWhether a speaker implicates ignorance or falsity of a value is a subject of
some disagreement among Horn and those ((&apos;.lider, 1979, Soames, 1982) who
have taken up his basic notion, In (Hirschberg, 1984) 1 contend that such
implicatures should be viewed as disjunctions, K(--■T) V ,1:(T), which may be
disarnbiguated by the nature of the ordering relation or by the context.

•
It is also important to note that, in (6), were R simply to deny
Q&apos;s query or to assert ignorance with a simple I don&apos;t know, Q
would be entitled, by virtue of the Cooperative Principle, to
assume that there is no scalar value whose truth R can in fact
affirm. That is, Q can assume that, as far as R knows, there are
no mushrooms that are poisonous, for otherwise R could commit
himself to the proposition that &apos;some mushrooms are poisonous&apos;.
More generally then, 11 is obliged by the Cooperative Principle,
and more especially by Joshi&apos;s (Joshi, 1982) modification of Grice&apos;s
Maxim of Quality: &apos;Do not. say anything which may imply for
the hearer something which you the speaker believe to be false.&apos;, to
provide an indirect response in (6), lest a simple direct response
entitle Q to conclude some false implicatures. Thus indirect
responses must be included among the set of all appropriate
responses to a given YNQ, since in some cases they may be the
most appropriate response R can make.

B. Scalar Imp&apos;feature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998755">
While scalar predication provides a principled explanation for (6),
a revised and extended notion of scalar im.plicature can
account for a much larger class of indirect responses to YNQs. It
can also suggest a revised representation of YNQs in general based
upon this enlarged class of appropriate responses.
Orderings not defined by entailment and orderings other than
linear orderings, including but not limited to set/set-member,
whole/part, process stages, spatial relationship, prerequisite
orderings, entity/attribute, isa hierarchy, or temporal ordering,
permit the conveyance of scalar implicatures in much the same

relationship orders the Reagan* and Nancy; R implicates that he
has not invited Ronald, for instance. In (8), starting a rough
draft precedes finishing a manuscript in the process of preparing
a paper. So Q is entitled to conclude that R has not finished the
manuscript or completed any later stage in this process, such as
finishing the rough draft.
More formally, any set of referents {b1,...,b} that can be
partially ordered by a relation 06 can support scalar
implicature. Any scale S that permits scalar implicature can be
represented as a partially-ordered set. For any referents b1, 132
on 5, b2 is higher on S than 131 iff la10b2; similarly, b1 is lower
on S than b2 iff la10b2. Any pair 131, b2 of incomparable
elements (elements not ordered with respect to one another by
0) will be termed alternate values with respect to S. This
redefinition of scale accommodates orderings such as those
mentioned above, while excluding orderings such as cycles, that do
not permit scalar implicature. It also helps define the inferences
licensed when R affirms a higher or an alternate value, or when he
denies or asserts ignorance of lower, higher, or alternate values.
For example, R affirms a higher scalar value than the value
queried in Bolinger&apos;s example reproduced in (2). If diffictat and
impossible are viewed on a scale defined in degrees of feasibility,
then Q can conclude that by affirming the higher value R has
affirmed the lower. Similarly. R may affirm an alternate value, as
he does in (31)). If R sees Honolulu and Hilo as both members of a
set of Hawaiian cities, he can affirm an unqueried set member
(Hilo) to deny a queried member (Hawaii). The affirmation of an
unqueried alternate value generally conveys the falsity or R&apos;s
ignorance of the queried value.
A partial ordering may be defined as an irreflexive, asymmetric, and
transitive relation.
Speakers may also license scalar implicatures by denying scalars.
The dual to Horn&apos;s notion of affirming the highest affirmable value
would be negating the lowest deniable scalar. In such a denial a
speaker may implicate his affirmation or ignorance of lower
scalars. So, in exchanges like (9a), a value higher than a queried
value (here,

a stage in the process of mortgage payment) may be denied to
convey the truth of the queried value. R may also deny lower
values (014 or alternate values (9c).
So, indirect scalar responses may be defined upon a number of
metrics and may involve the affirmation or negation of higher,
lower, or alternate values. They may also involve the affirmation
or denial of more than one scalar for a single query, as shown in
(10). Assume that Mary and Joe are brother and s:ster and both
are known to Q and R. Also, Mary and Tim are fellow-workers

answers given — as well as a variety of others, such as &apos;She used
to&apos; or even &apos;Joe used to love ice-skating.&apos; That is, R may base his
response upon any one or more scalars he perceives as invoked by
Q&apos;s query. In addition, a single lexical item (here Mary) may
invoke more than one scale: R may view Mary as a member of a
family or of a set of fellow-workers, for example, to generate
responses (101)) and (10c), respectively.

In (6), for example, the desideratum (P V -4) of Q&apos;s query is the

V &apos;not x1 mushrooms are poisonous&apos; represents the open
proposition formed by substituting a variable for all in P, where x1
ranges over the vnlites on SI, no/It/some/all. Then the set of

defined by the affirmation or negation of each of the possible

mush monis are poisonous, -&amp;quot;ail mtyltrooms are poisonous). The
set of pos:-ible true responses will be a subset of this set,
determined by R from his knowledge base. Note that al and
may in fact be identical. Thus, the simple direct responses,
equivalent to All mushrooms are poisonous&apos; and &apos;Not all
mushrooms are poisonous&apos;, are accommodated in this schema.
This characterization of potential responses suggests a new
representation for YNQs. roilowing Hintikka, one might
paraphrase the query in (6) as &amp;quot;Bring it about that I know that x1
mushrooms are poisonous or that I know that not x1 mushrooms
are poisonous&apos;, where x1 ranges over the values on some scale St
upon which the queried vidue semi appears (assuming a many-
sorted epistemic logic). Thus the query might be represented as
! 3S13x1 Isome,x1ESIA {KQ(xl mushrooms are
pois(nous) V KQ-,(x1 mushrooms are poisonous))).
For a query like that in (10), an appropriate representation might
be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8034455">
! 3S13x13S,,3x23S33s3 {Mary,x1ESIAlove,x2ES2

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988303185185185">
11 ntay then instantiate each variable with any value from its
domain in his response.
In the general case, then. YNQs might be represented as
! 3S1 3S.3x1 3x, {b1,x1ES1 A .... A bn,xnES„ A
{KQ(P,i ..) v KQ-(1&apos;xi x.)}.
This representation shares some features of standard
representations of wh-questions, suggesting that it simply extends
Kiefer&apos;s view of focussed YNQs to all YNQs. However, there arc
several ::ignificant distinctions between this representation and
standard representations of wh-questians, and, thus, between it and
Kiefer&apos;s suggestion. First, it restricts the domains of variables to
scales invoked by corresponding scalars in the original queries
desideratum and it includes a negative disjunct. &apos;Do you like
Honolulu?&apos; for example might have as its desideratum
3S13x13S23x23S23x31you,x1ESIAlike,x2ES2
AI lonoluln,x3ES3 A {K0(x1 x2 x2)VKQ-(x1 x2 x3))),
while the corresponding wit-question &apos;What do you like?&apos; would
have as its desideratum 3x K(you like .r.). Second, the
representation proposed here allows for reference in a query to
mull iple scalars, or, multiple focii, which Kiefer does not consider.
Third, it avoids both the division of YNQs into focussed and non-
focussed queries and the dependency between wh-responses and
negative responses noted above; hence, the representation is
simpler and more unified. So, YNQs are not represented as wh-
questions, although Kiefer&apos;s focussed YNQs can be accommodated
in this more general representation, which I will term a *color
representation.

A scalar representation of YNQs can accommodate a wide range
of direct and indirect responses which are common in natural
discourse but which current representations of YNQs cannot
support. Of course, such a redefinition is no panacea for the
limitations of current representations: In its current form, for
instance, there are some appropriate responses to indirect speech
acts, such as (II), which it

Too, the actual representation of a particular query may vary

terms, it is difficult to determine even an abstract specification of
the set of all possible responses to a given query; should temporal

&apos;understood&apos; scales can be identified, much of this difficulty might
be alleviated. The representation proposed here does
accommodate a far larger class of appropriate responses than
representations previously suggested, and accommodates them in a
unified way. With further refinement it promises to provide a
useful tool for theoretical and computational treatments of YNQs.

This paper reviews the limitations of several proposed revisions. It proposes a new definition of YNQs based upon research on a type of implicature, here helps define appropriate responses to YNQs. representing YNQs as queries possible to support variety of system and user responses in a principled way.</abstract>

Ezpothesis Confirmation Bolinger (Bolinger, 1978) has called such interpretations into question by showing that YNQs may have very different meanings from their alternative-question counterparts; they also have more restricted paraphrase and intonation patterns. In Bolinger&apos;s view the term yes-no query has hypnotized scholars into assuming that, simply because a class of question can be answered by a ves or no, these alternatives are criterial, and every YNQ is intended to elicit one or the other. He proposes instead that YNQs be viewed as hypotheses pot forward for confirmation, amendment, or discontinuation — in any degree. Thus, in Doling</context>

Speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual recognition of these maxims may give rise to conversational implicatures: An utterance conversationally implicates a proposition P when it conveys P by virtue of the hearer&apos;s assumption of the speaker&apos;s cooperativeness. While a speaker may not always obey these maxims, the hearer&apos;s expectations are based on her belief that such conventions represent the norm. A.
