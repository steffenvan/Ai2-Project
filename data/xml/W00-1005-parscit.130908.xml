This paper presents an empirical analysis
of prosodic phenomena (intonation and
timing) in &apos;common ground units&apos;
(Nakatani &amp; Traum 1999). The analysis
is used to address questions of the role of
prosody in dialogue while taking into
account the complexities of multispeaker
discourse. We address some
methodological concerns of how best to
carry out a study of this kind as well as
our theoretical questions about the formal
identification of dialogue structures at
levels higher than the micro-level of
&apos;dialogue act&apos;, or &apos;move&apos;.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959305">
This paper reports some of the results from our
research into the relationship between prosodic
structure and discourse structure in dialogue.
One of our particular interests is how to identify
and analyse relevant prosodic parameters in
multi-speaker discourse. We have been
examining the kinds of dialogue structure
frameworks that best account for patterns of
prosodic phenomena; and conversely, the types
of dialogue structure that exhibit prosodic
regularities. Our research domain is human-
human natural dialogue settings but our questions
are equally relevant to researchers working on
systems for more naturalistic human-computer
interfaces, as well as those developing better
automated systems for annotating large speech
corpora.
The main methodological considerations
associated with our current work are:
a) how natural dialogues can be reliably
annotated to allow independent comparisons
and correlations of prosodic and structural
features,
b) the identification and classification of units
of dialogue that reflect the &apos;joint action&apos;
feature of interactive discourse (ie. that both
participants in a dialogue contribute to
dialogue structure (Clark 1992, 1996), an
aspect of dialogue that fundamentally
differentiates it from monologic discourse).
These issues will be addressed in this paper
using data from a corpus of naturally produced
spoken dialogue taken from the Australian Map
Task corpus (Millar et al 1994). Here we have
focussed on the process of grounding, the
assignment of utterances to &apos;common ground
units&apos; (CGUs - Nakatani &amp; Traum 1999) and the
internal structure of these units, as a means of
illustrating some of the problems that both
methodological issues raise. We show how
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999929583333333">
some of these problems might be overcome by
focussing on sequences of initiating and
responding (typically grounding) contributions
within CGUs, as a site for prosodic analysis,
rather than on the boundaries of the units as a
whole (cf. Stirling et al 2000a). This approach
thus preserves the notion that one can identify
&apos;chunks&apos; of dialogue in which particular types of
information are acknowledged as being in the
common ground of both participants, while
remaining true to the dynamic nature of the
grounding negotiation.

1.1. Prosody and Discourse Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968804878049">
Most empirical work examining prosody in
discourse has focussed on its function in
monologue (eg. Swerts 1997, Nakatani et al
1995, Hirchberg &amp; Nakatani 1996). These
studies have found that a range of acoustic
parameters associated with prosody, such as
final lengthening and type of boundary tone, are
good indicators of the boundaries between
different discourse units at micro and macro
levels of discourse structure.
More recently, there has been an interest in
examining how prosody may be used in dialogue
to signal discourse structure in that domain.
Shriberg et al (1998) showed that various
prosodic cues (duration, FO, pause length and
speaking rate) were relevant for the automatic
classification of dialogue &apos;acts&apos;. Stirling et al
(2000b) similarly showed strong
correspondences between the boundaries of
dialogue acts and prosodic phenomena such as
pitch reset and intonational phrase boundaries
(represented as ToBI &apos;break indices&apos;). But
dialogue acts are the &apos;parts&apos; of dialogue most
akin with structural elements of monologic
discourse, since each &apos;act&apos; can be analysed as
independent utterances by a single speaker.
Higher levels of dialogue structure necessarily
involve some interactive &apos;chunk&apos; of the discourse
to which both participants in the dialogue
contribute some speech.
So while it is clear that prosody serves to delimit
dialogue acts, and to some extent distinguish
between them (eg. Shriberg et al 1998, Koiso et
al 1998, Stirling et al 2000b), the question
remains whether prosody is also a reliable
indicator of dialogue structure at higher levels
(analogous with the higher levels of monologic
discourse structure described in Swerts (1997),
Nakatani et al. (1995), and others) and to what
uses are prosodic phenomena put in the context
of higher levels of dialogue structure.

1.2 Grounding and Common Ground Units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905733333333">
Grounding is the process by which information
contributed by participants in interaction is taken
to have entered the &apos;common ground&apos;, or mutual
knowledge of the participants (Clark &amp; Schaefer
1989, Clark 1996, Traum 1994). The process of
grounding requires that one participant
contributes something to the discourse
(minimally, a dialogue act), and that the other
participant make some indication that the
contribution has been heard and accepted as a
contribution (though not necessarily understood).
This &apos;indication&apos; may be a verbal
acknowledgment (or some other kind of verbal
response) or it may be some kind of non-verbal
communicative act (like head nods, facial
expression and other gestures).
Traum (1998) and Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999)
have recently proposed taking grounding as the
basic principle behind the structuring of dialogue
at levels ligher than the dialogue act. Minimal
units of acknowledged common ground have
been considered as the building blocks of higher
level dialogue structures based on intentional or
informational content (eg. &apos;Common Ground
Units&apos;, or `CGUs&apos; Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999)).
CGUs, which represent grounding at the
&apos;illocutionary level&apos; (Clark 1996), have been
proposed as a meso-level dialogue structure -
roughly the same level that dialogue games
(Carletta et al, 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998886">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985812">
Sinclair &amp; Coulthard 1975) occupy in their
dialogue structure frameworks.
The appeal of taking units based on grounding as
the level of dialogue structure above the
microlevel of &apos;act&apos; (as argued in Nak.atani &amp;
Traum 1999) lies in its prioritization of mutual
understanding as a central component of
dialogue, regardless of the type of initiation and
response. In the &apos;CGU&apos; framework, some
responses themselves get grounded so that the
result is a complex configuration of overlapping
and embedded units of information entered into
the common ground of the participants. This
approach thus acknowledges importance of the
contributions by both participants in the
grounding process. It highlights the &apos;joint action&apos;
aspect of dialogic communication.
Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue by
the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al
1999) showed a low degree of intercoder
reliability, especially for those coding the HCRC
Map Task corpus (Anderson et al 1991). Some
of the inconsistencies across coders were
attributed to &amp;quot;intonation and timing&amp;quot; (p. 61), as
well as to difficulties in coding different types of
acknowledgments. Some proposals for the
classification of acknowledgments were made
(Core et al 1999) and Stirling et al (2000a) have
noted some parameters along which CGUs might
be further classified.
The ways that this classification has been refined
and utilised for the current paper are described in
section 2 (methods), where we also describe our
system of annotation for both prosodic and CGU
properties of the dialogues, and explain our
method for utilising this annotation for the current
analysis. In section 3 we present some results of
our investigation of prosody and grounding in the
light of the methodological issues listed above.
These results will be used in section 4 to address
the following theoretical questions, as well as to
set the agenda for future research into prosodic
correlates of dialogue structure:
a) can prosody be used as a heuristic for
identifying dialogue structure above the level
of the &apos;dialogue act&apos;?
b) does the process of &apos;grounding&apos; have any
formal basis, prosodic or otherwise,
independent of the identification of dialogue
acts?

2.1 Annotation Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998047628571428">
Our corpus consists of 4 dialogues from the
MAP TASK section of the Australian National
Database of Spoken Language - ANDOSL
(Millar et al, 1994). This corpus is closely
modelled on the HCRC Map Task (Anderson et
al 1991). Participants worked in pairs, each with
a map in front of them that the other could not
see. One participant (the &apos;instruction-giver&apos; IG)
had a route marked on their map and was
required by the task to instruct the other (the
&apos;instruction-follower&apos; IF) in drawing the correct
route onto their own map. The maps were
similar, but differed in the presence, position and
names of certain of the landmarks. Each pair of
participants participated in two dialogues,
swapping roles of instruction-giver and
instruction-follower, and thus producing a first
time and second time attempt at the task.
The four dialogues used here were from two
pairs of participants: the two dialogues from a
pair &apos;Known&apos; to one another, differing in which
participant took the role of instruction-giver, and
the two dialogues from a pair &apos;Unknown&apos; to one
another, also differing in which participant took
the role of instruction-giver. In each case, the
pairs were mixed-gender. The dialogues were
chosen randomly and the speakers belonged to
the General Australian English dialectal grouping.
The pre-recorded dialogues were copied from
CD and digitised for analysis at 22 kHz using
Entropic&apos;s ESPS/ Waves + speech analysis
software running on a Sun workstation in the
Phonetics Laboratory of the University of
Melbourne. A complete orthographic
transcription of the dialogues was carried out.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995345">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932741379311">
The prosodic features of the dialogues were
labelled on separate tiers using the ToBI (Tone
and Break Indices) prosodic transcription
conventions for Australian English, detailed in
Fletcher &amp; Harrington (1996), closely modelled
on the criteria developed for American English
intonation (Beckman &amp; Ayers Elam 1994/1997).
The dialogues were prosodically annotated for
break indices (degree of juncture) and phrase
and boundary tones according to ToBI
conventions using the Xwaves label function.
The dialogues were also annotated on separate
tiers in Xwaves for the timing features of pause
location and duration (in ms), and overlap
location and duration (in ms)&apos;. These features
were noted with respect to preceding and
following talk.
The features of break index, phrase and
boundary tones and pause and overlap
phenomena were selected to address the
&apos;intonation and timing&apos; problems that were raised
by the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al
1999), and because related work in conversation
analysis has demonstrated the importance of
intonation (especially final contours) to being
able to account for the meaning of
acknowledgments in interaction (eg. Muller
1996, Gardner 1998).
Break Indices (BI) were labelled as follows: 4
(full intonation phrase boundary); 3 (intermediate
intonation phrase boundary); 3p (disfluent
intermediate intonation phrase boundary).
Boundary tones were labelled as follows: H-H%
for a high rising tone (131 4); L-L% for a falling
or low tone (BI 4); L-H% for a low rising tone
(BI 4); H-L% for a mid-level tone (BI 4); H- for
a high intermediate phrase boundary (131 3),
for a low intermediate phrase boundary (BI 3).
The pause and overlap labelling allowed us to
extract information about the timing of each
speaker contribution with respect to the previous
and following contributions to the talk With
respect to the preceding talk, contributions were
analysed as having a pause before (pb), partially
overlapping with the preceding contribution (olb),
completely overlapping (01), no pause or overlap
with the preceding unit (or &apos;latch&apos; - lb), or
&apos;continued&apos; (if the previous contribution was by
the same speaker without an interceding pause
(c)). With respect to the following talk,
contributions were analysed as having a pause
after (pa), partially overlapping with the following
contribution (ola), completely overlapping (ol), no
pause or overlap with following contribution (or
latch - la), or &apos;continued&apos; (if the next contribution
was by the same speaker without an interceding
pause (c)). Table 1 provides a summary of the
labels used for prosodic and timing phenomena.

Since the major goal of our research was to
investigate associations between prosodic
phenomena and discourse structure, we coded
discourse categories independently from dividing
the speech signal into prosodic units and the
coding of prosodic phenomena (these parameters
were coded by different researchers).
The dialogues were annotated for Common
Ground. Units, following Nakatani &amp; Traum
(1999).&amp;quot; The coding was carried out by two
researchers independently who then collaborated
on a consensual version for each dialogue. The
codes were entered on separate tiers in ESPS/
Waves +, separated according to which speaker
gave which contribution. This meant that
initiations and endpoints of CGUs were
numbered and aligned with the speaker who
began and ended each unit. Within each CGU
we also coded the first &apos;response&apos; by the other
participant, which typically established either that
the initial information was entered into the
common ground, or that further negotiation was
required in order to ground the information. In

called &apos;Simple&apos; CGUs, while the latter type we IG: [you&apos;re sweeping] east
called &apos;Complex&apos; CGUs. Complex CGUs were IF: yeh okay well don&apos;t-- yeh okay allright
further classified into four types based on I&apos;m going east
pragmatic and sequential criteria, as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997086181818182">
a) Overlapping CGUs, where the grounding
element of one unit was itself grounded with
some verbal acknowledgment in the next
CGU, as in (1) below.
b) CGUs which consisted of further
acknowledgment(s) by the other speaker
subsequent to the first grounding element, as
in (2) below.
c) CGUs which contained more than one
acknowledgment by the same speaker (as in
(3) below)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9410648">
d) CGUs which negotiated information at
different levels of communication lower than
the &apos;illocutionary&apos; level (eg. the level of
&apos;presentation&apos; or &apos;locution&apos; (Clark 1996)),
and were therefore considered part of a
larger CGU which was grounded at the level
of illocution, as in (4) below.
All four types of complex CGUs represent some
kind of &apos;expansion&apos; of the canonical CGU
exchange. In overlapping CGUs, the second
&apos;response&apos; functions to ground the first response.
In multiple acknowledgment CGUs, the second
response is not analysed as &apos;grounding&apos;, but is
nevertheless some kind of further
acknowledgment (either by the same speaker or
by the other speaker). In the final case of
complex CGUs, the first response is a signal that
perhaps some part of the initial contribution had
not entered into the common ground and that
further collaboration was required.&amp;quot;
These categories are not claimed to represent
the only way that CGUs can be classified (cf.
Core et al 1999). Nevertheless they provide us
with a useful basis for addressing differences in
the role of prosody in CGUs.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.9922">

<bodyText confidence="0.9999948">
Altogether there were 419 CGUs in the corpus.
Of these, 241 were &apos;simple&apos; CGUs and 178
were &apos;complex&apos;. Of the 178 complex CGUs, 47
(26%) were &apos;overlapping&apos;, 59 (33%) contained
multiple acknowledgment by both participants, 52
(29%) contained multiple acknowledgements by
the same speaker, and 20 (11%) contained more
complex negotiations of understanding until
acknowledgment of mutual understanding of the
initial dialogue act was reached (the level at
which CGUs were delineated).
We hypothesised that since, on our definition,
complex CGUs differed from the simple type in
terms of the structure of their response &apos;phase&apos;,
rather than in terms of their initiation phase, there
should be no difference between simple and
complex CGUs with respect to the timing and
prosodic profile of initiations. However, we
predicted that there might be quantitatively
recognisable properties of the first response in
complex CGUs which motivated their expansion,
and that these would be different from those
found in simple CGUs. While we expected that
these &apos;recognisable&apos; properties would involve a
combination of grammatical, pragmatic and
prosodic properties, here we were only
interested in the extent to which simple and
complex CGUs could be differentiated on
prosodic grounds.
In order to check these hypotheses, we pooled
the four dialogues and compared initiation and
first response contributions in simple and
complex CGUs for each of the four parameters
identified above (BI, boundary tone, timing
(before) and timing (after)). Chi square tests
were carried out on each of these comparisons
to determine which sets of parameters displayed
significant variation between simple CGUs and
complex CGUs. The results are presented in the
following section.

<bodyText confidence="0.999938222222222">
Chi square tests on the combined totals of all
CGUs showed highly significant differences
(p&lt;0.001) between initiations and responses for
all four prosodic and timing parameters. This
result is consistent with those reported in Stirling
et al (2000b), where it was shown that initiation
type dialogue acts could be prosodically
differentiated from response type dialogue acts.
Here we were more interested in the question of
whether the complexity of the CGU was also
reflected in initiation and response contributions.
The results reported in the following subsections
therefore refer to the percentage number of
each prosodic and timing parameter as a
proportion of the CGU type (percentages are in
boldface) - the total number of simple CGUs or
the total number of complex CGUs - for
initiations and responses independently.

In contrast with the results for BI reported
above, there were significant differences found
between simple and complex CGUs for
boundary tones in both initiation and response
contributions. With respect to initiating
contributions, a higher proportion of low ailing
(L-L%) boundary tones (42.1% vs. 29.5%) and
a lower proportion of low rising (L-H%)
boundary tones (18.5% vs. 29.9%) were found
in the complex CGUs, compared with simple
CGUs. Proportions of high rising (H-H%)
boundary tones were not significantly different
and there were proportionally few instances of
other types of contours.
Like initiation contributions, the results for
response contributions also show a higher
proportion of low falling tones in complex CGUs
than in simple CGUs (30.3% cf. 17.5%). The
proportions of both high rising and low rising
tones appears stable across the types of CGUs
however.
The numbers of response contributions which
had other types of boundary tones (including no
boundary tone) were much higher than those
found for initiating units. This was expected,
since responses to initiation units were typically
acknowledgments of grounding (like &apos;okay&apos; or
`yeh&apos;), which were then followed by other talk
by the same speaker continuing an intonational
phrase. The higher proportion of such &apos;non-
final&apos; contours (H-L%, L., H- and none) for
simple CGUs than complex CGUs reflects a set
of instances in which the respondent answers a
yes-no question, and then makes a further
response in the same intonational phrase that
is new information which was itself grounded
(and was therefore coded as a new CGU).
These non-final contours typically also
corresponded with break indices of less than 4,
accounting for the relatively high proportion of
BI3s in responses in complex CGUs (noted in
the previous section).

Like the results for break indices, the results for
the timing of units with respect to immediately
prior talk showed no significant differences
between simple and complex CGUs for initiation
contributions, but did show significant differences
with respect to first responses. In particular,
there was a relatively high proportion of
responses in complex CGUs whose onset
occurred while the other speaker was still
talking, resulting in an overlap (18.5% vs. 7.5%).
When the first response in a CGU is at least
partially overlapping with the initiation
contribution, it creates an environment in which
both participants must work harder (ie. make
more contributions) in order for the
acknowledgment of common groundethess to be
clear. At least some of these overlaps resulted
in the same speaker repeating an
acknowledgment of grounding with no overlap,
as in example (3) above. However, they also
resulted in complex CGUs of the other kinds.

The results for the timing of the unit following
the target contribution also showed no significant
difference for initiations between simple and
complex CGUs, while the responses did show a
difference of distribution. However, the
asymmetry in overlapping found in the preceding
set of the results did not occur when one
considered the contribution following the first
response. In this case, the category which
showed the greatest degree of difference
between simple and complex CGUs was the
category of &apos;latch&apos; (22.5% vs. 12%), where the
second speaker timed his/her next turn to follow
from the target contribution without any pause or
overlap. Responses in complex CGUs showed a
higher proportion of latching with the following
contribution. This high proportion of latching is
perhaps an indication of a smooth transition from
first response to further grounding contributions
within the CGU.

The results show that for three of the
parameters investigated (break index, timing
before and after the target contribution), there
was little or no variation according to the type of
CGU that the contribution initiated (simple or
complex). This finding was consistent with our
hypothesis that if there were any measurable
differences between these CGU types, they
would be found in the first response contribution
of the CGU, and not in its initiation contribution.
Also consistent with our hypothesis was the
result that all four prosodic and . timing

<bodyText confidence="0.999971953125">
parameters displayed differences between
simple and complex CGUs in the first response
contribution. Complex CGUs displayed more
overlapped first responses, fewer incomplete
intonation phrases (BI of less than 4) and a
higher proportion of low falling boundary tones
than the response contributions of simple CGUs.
Explanations for some of these results were
provided in the previous section, but further
analysis is required before we can really gain an
accurate picture of the formal profile of complex
CGUs (cf. simple CGUs). In particular, we
require an analysis of the different types of
complex CGUs to determine whether they
display formal regularities. It may be that only
one or two types of complex CGUs are
contributing to the patterns observed here. Such
an analysis is planned in future work. We also
plan to conduct a similar study that takes into
account the dialogue act type of initiation and
first responses to determine more extensively the
full range of factors which influence intonation
patterns and the timing of contributions in
dialogue!&apos;
Our results do confirm the necessity of
developing strategies for the analysis of prosody
in dialogue that take into account the effects of
sequence. Not only did initiation contributions
overall behave differently to response
contributions with respect to prosody and timing
(a result which we did not address in detail here),
but the responses themselves could also be
differentiated based on whether they &apos;finished&apos; a
CGU, or whether they mere followed by other
contributions before grounding was achieved.
Results such as these suggest that with respect
to the formal identification (cf. pragmatic
identification) of levels of dialogue structure
higher than the dialogue act, structures defined in
terms of sequential position, as such as
adjacency pairs, might be more compatible with
patterns we have observed in our data. The low
level of intercoder reliability for CGUs, as
reported in Core et al (1999) also suggests the
lack of readily identifiable formal properties.
Even taking &apos;intonation and timing&apos; into account,
as we have done here, does not clearly point to a
formal profile of CGUs independent of
sequences of dialogue acts.
Empirical investigation\ of the role of prosody in
multi-speaker discourse is still in its infancy, and
we are still developing tools of analysis that free
us from looking only at those aspects of dialogue
that best mirror the structure of monologic
discourse. We have found that our method of
both prosodic and discourse segment annotation
in ESPS/Waves+ has provided us with the power
to develop this investigation further. In future
work we will be able to easily incoiporate
additional variables, such as dialogue acts,
complex CGU type, and a range of other
prosodic phenomena into our analysis, while
keeping track of the sequences in which these
joint actions occur.

Overlap location and duration could be measured
accurately because the dialogues were recorded on
dual channels.
We also coded other features of dialogue structure
such as dialogue acts. See Stirling et al (2000b) for
more details of that annotation method.
l&amp;quot; The categories of complex CGUs were not all
mutually exclusive. For example, a CGU could contain
multiple acknowledgments by both speakers. Snce
these overlaps occurred infrequently, for the
purposes of this paper we assigned each complex
CGU to only one &apos;primary&apos; classification.
i&amp;quot; Such an analysis might for example, help provide an
explanation for why, contra to our expectations, the
initiation phases of complex CGUs showed
differences in boundary tone phenomena from the
initiation phases of simple CGUs.

This approach thus acknowledges importance of the contributions by both participants in the grounding process. It highlights the &apos;joint action&apos; aspect of dialogic communication. Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue by the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al 1999) showed a low degree of intercoder reliability, especially for those coding the HCRC Map Task corpus (Anderson et al 1991). Some of the inconsistencies across coders were attributed to &amp;quot;intonation and timing&amp;quot; (p. 61), as well as to difficulties in coding different types of acknowledgments.

Traum (1998) and Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999) have recently proposed taking grounding as the basic principle behind the structuring of dialogue at levels ligher than the dialogue act. Minimal units of acknowledged common ground have been considered as the building blocks of higher level dialogue structures based on intentional or informational content (eg. &apos;Common Ground Units&apos;, or `CGUs&apos; Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999)). CGUs, which represent grounding at the &apos;illocutionary level&apos; (Clark 1996), have been proposed as a meso-level dialogue structure - roughly the same level that dialogue games (Carletta et al, 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg. 37 Sinclair &amp; Coulthard 1975) occupy in their dialogue structure frameworks. The appeal of taking units based on grounding as the level of dialogue structure above the microlevel of &apos;act&apos; (as argued in Nak.atani &amp; Traum 1999) lies in its prioritization of mutual understanding as a central component of dialogue, regardless of the type of initiation and response. In the &apos;CGU&apos; framework, some responses themselves get grounded so that the result is a complex configuration of overlapping and embedded units of information entered into the common ground of the participants.

The process of grounding requires that one participant contributes something to the discourse (minimally, a dialogue act), and that the other participant make some indication that the contribution has been heard and accepted as a contribution (though not necessarily understood). This &apos;indication&apos; may be a verbal acknowledgment (or some other kind of verbal response) or it may be some kind of non-verbal communicative act (like head nods, facial expression and other gestures).

In the &apos;CGU&apos; framework, some responses themselves get grounded so that the result is a complex configuration of overlapping and embedded units of information entered into the common ground of the participants. This approach thus acknowledges importance of the contributions by both participants in the grounding process. It highlights the &apos;joint action&apos; aspect of dialogic communication. Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue by the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al 1999) showed a low degree of intercoder reliability, especially for those coding the HCRC Map Task corpus (Anderson et al 1991). Some of the inconsistencies across coders were attributed to &amp;quot;intonation and timing&amp;quot; (p. 61), as well as to difficulties in coding different types of acknowledgments. Some proposals for the classification of acknowledgments were made (Core et al 1999) and Stirling et al (2000a) have noted some parameters along which CGUs might be further classified. The ways that this classification has been refined and utilised for the current paper are described in section 2 (methods), </context>

In the final case of complex CGUs, the first response is a signal that perhaps some part of the initial contribution had not entered into the common ground and that further collaboration was required.&amp;quot; These categories are not claimed to represent the only way that CGUs can be classified (cf. Core et al 1999). Nevertheless they provide us with a useful basis for addressing differences in the role of prosody in CGUs. 40 Altogether there were 419 CGUs in the corpus.

Results such as these suggest that with respect to the formal identification (cf. pragmatic identification) of levels of dialogue structure higher than the dialogue act, structures defined in terms of sequential position, as such as adjacency pairs, might be more compatible with patterns we have observed in our data. The low level of intercoder reliability for CGUs, as reported in Core et al (1999) also suggests the lack of readily identifiable formal properties. Even taking &apos;intonation and timing&apos; into account, as we have done here, does not clearly point to a formal profile of CGUs independent of sequences of dialogue acts. Empirical investigation\ of the role of prosody in multi-speaker discourse is still in its infancy, and we are still developing tools of analysis that free us from looking only at those aspects of dialogue that best mirror the structure of monologic discourse.

Swerts 1997, Nakatani et al 1995, Hirchberg &amp; Nakatani 1996). These studies have found that a range of acoustic parameters associated with prosody, such as final lengthening and type of boundary tone, are good indicators of the boundaries between different discourse units at micro and macro levels of discourse structure. More recently, there has been an interest in examining how prosody may be used in dialogue to signal discourse structure in that domain. Shriberg et al (1998) showed that various prosodic cues (duration, FO, pause length and speaking rate) were relevant for the automatic classification of dialogue &apos;acts&apos;. St</context>

Traum (1998) and Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999) have recently proposed taking grounding as the basic principle behind the structuring of dialogue at levels ligher than the dialogue act. Minimal units of acknowledged common ground have been considered as the building blocks of higher level dialogue structures based on intentional or informational content (eg. &apos;Common Ground Units&apos;, or `CGUs&apos; Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999)). CGUs, which represent grounding at the &apos;illocutionary level&apos; (Clark 1996), have been proposed as a meso-level dialogue structure - roughly the same level that dialogue games (Carletta et al, 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg. 37 Sin</context>

Minimal units of acknowledged common ground have been considered as the building blocks of higher level dialogue structures based on intentional or informational content (eg. &apos;Common Ground Units&apos;, or `CGUs&apos; Nakatani &amp; Traum (1999)). CGUs, which represent grounding at the &apos;illocutionary level&apos; (Clark 1996), have been proposed as a meso-level dialogue structure - roughly the same level that dialogue games (Carletta et al, 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg. 37 Sinclair &amp; Coulthard 1975) occupy in their dialogue structure frameworks. The appeal of taking units based on grounding as the level of dialogue structure above the microlevel of &apos;act&apos; (as argued in Nak.atani &amp; Traum 1999) lies in its prioritization of mutual understanding as a central component of dialogue, regardless of the type of initiation and response. In the &apos;CGU&apos; framework, some responses themselves get grounded so that the result is a complex configuration of overlapping and embedded units of information entered into the common ground of the participants. This approach thus acknowledges importance of the contr</context>

Here we have focussed on the process of grounding, the assignment of utterances to &apos;common ground units&apos; (CGUs - Nakatani &amp; Traum 1999) and the internal structure of these units, as a means of illustrating some of the problems that both methodological issues raise. We show how 2C some of these problems might be overcome by focussing on sequences of initiating and responding (typically grounding) contributions within CGUs, as a site for prosodic analysis, rather than on the boundaries of the units as a whole (cf. Stirling et al 2000a). This approach thus preserves the notion that one can identify &apos;chunks&apos; of dialogue in which particular types of information are acknowledged as being in the common ground of both participants, while remaining true to the dynamic nature of the grounding negotiation. 1. Background 1.1. Prosody and Discourse Structure Most empirical work examining prosody in discourse has focussed on its function in monologue (eg. Swerts 1997, Nakatani et al 1995, Hirchberg &amp; Nakatani 1996). These studies have found that a range of acoustic parameters associated with prosody, such as final lengthening and typ</context>
<context position="4876" citStr="Stirling et al 2000" startWordPosition="705" endWordPosition="708"> such as pitch reset and intonational phrase boundaries (represented as ToBI &apos;break indices&apos;). But dialogue acts are the &apos;parts&apos; of dialogue most akin with structural elements of monologic discourse, since each &apos;act&apos; can be analysed as independent utterances by a single speaker. Higher levels of dialogue structure necessarily involve some interactive &apos;chunk&apos; of the discourse to which both participants in the dialogue contribute some speech. So while it is clear that prosody serves to delimit dialogue acts, and to some extent distinguish between them (eg. Shriberg et al 1998, Koiso et al 1998, Stirling et al 2000b), the question remains whether prosody is also a reliable indicator of dialogue structure at higher levels (analogous with the higher levels of monologic discourse structure described in Swerts (1997), Nakatani et al. (1995), and others) and to what uses are prosodic phenomena put in the context of higher levels of dialogue structure. 1.2 Grounding and Common Ground Units Grounding is the process by which information contributed by participants in interaction is taken to have entered the &apos;common ground&apos;, or mutual knowledge of the participants (Clark &amp; Schaefer 1989, Clark 1996, Traum 1994).</context>

It highlights the &apos;joint action&apos; aspect of dialogic communication. Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue by the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al 1999) showed a low degree of intercoder reliability, especially for those coding the HCRC Map Task corpus (Anderson et al 1991). Some of the inconsistencies across coders were attributed to &amp;quot;intonation and timing&amp;quot; (p. 61), as well as to difficulties in coding different types of acknowledgments. Some proposals for the classification of acknowledgments were made (Core et al 1999) and Stirling et al (2000a) have noted some parameters along which CGUs might be further classified. The ways that this classification has been refined and utilised for the current paper are described in section 2 (methods), where we also describe our system of annotation for both prosodic and CGU properties of the dialogues, and explain our method for utilising this annotation for the current analysis. In section 3 we present some results of our investigation of prosody and grounding in the light of the methodological issues listed above. These results will be used in section 4 to address the following theoretical qu</context>

Within each CGU we also coded the first &apos;response&apos; by the other participant, which typically established either that the initial information was entered into the common ground, or that further negotiation was required in order to ground the information. In 39 this paper, we only considered CGUs that (1) contained fully grounded infbrmation at their IF: am I to the left-hand side or the rightclose (ie. we did not include abandoned or hand side discontinuous CGUs - see Nakatani &amp; Traum of the d— 1999). In Stirling et al (2000a) we reported on of your Galah Open-cut Mine some of the prosodic characteristics of the final IG: looking at it you&apos;re on the left unit in CGUs (break indices and turn boundaries (finishes one CGU and starts another) only). Here we report on the prosodic IF: okay characteristics of the initiation move of the CGU and the prosodic profile of this first responding (2) contribution.

Chi square tests were carried out on each of these comparisons to determine which sets of parameters displayed significant variation between simple CGUs and complex CGUs. The results are presented in the following section. 3. Results Chi square tests on the combined totals of all CGUs showed highly significant differences (p&lt;0.001) between initiations and responses for all four prosodic and timing parameters. This result is consistent with those reported in Stirling et al (2000b), where it was shown that initiation type dialogue acts could be prosodically differentiated from response type dialogue acts. Here we were more interested in the question of whether the complexity of the CGU was also reflected in initiation and response contributions. The results reported in the following subsections therefore refer to the percentage number of each prosodic and timing parameter as a proportion of the CGU type (percentages are in boldface) - the total number of simple CGUs or the total number of complex CGUs - for initiations and responses independently. 3.1 Correspondences </context>
