<bodyText confidence="0.999920863636363">
The relevance of human judgment in an
evaluation campaign is illustrated here
through the DEFT text mining campaigns.
In a first step, testing a topic for a cam-
paign among a limited number of human
evaluators informs us about the feasibility
of a task. This information comes from the
results obtained by the judges, as well as
from their personal impressions after pass-
ing the test.
In a second step, results from individual
judges, as well as their pairwise matching,
are used in order to adjust the task (choice
of a marking scale for DEFT’07 and selec-
tion of topical categories for DEFT’08).
Finally, the mutual comparison of com-
petitors’ results, at the end of the evalu-
ation campaign, confirms the choices we
made at its starting point, and provides
means to redefine the task when we shall
launch a future campaign based on the
same topic.

For the past four years, the DEFT1 (D´efi Fouille
de Texte) campaigns have been aiming to evalu-
ate methods and software developed by several re-
search teams in French text mining, on a variety of
topics.

speeches (2005), the topical segmentation of po-
litical, scientific and juridical corpora (2006), the
automatic affectation of opinion values to texts de-
veloping an argumented judgment (2007), and the
identification of the genre and topic of a docu-
ment (2008).
Human judgment was used during the prepara-
tion of the last two campaigns, to assess the dif-
ficulty of the task, and to see which parameters
could be modified. To do this, before the partic-
ipants start competing via their software, we put
human judges in front of versions of the task with
various sets of parameters. This allows us to adjust
the definition of the task according to which diffi-
culties were encountered, and how judges agree to-
gether. These human judges are in small number,
and belong to our team. However, results of the
campaign are automatically evaluated with refer-
ence to results attached to the corpus from the start.
This is because the evaluation of a campaign’s
results by human judges is expensive. For in-
stance, TREC2 international evaluation campaigns
are supported by the NIST institute and funded by
state agencies. In Europe, on the same domains,
the CLEF3 campaigns are funded by the Euro-
pean Commission, and in France, evaluation cam-
paigns are also funded by projects, such as Tech-
nolangue4. DEFT campaigns, however, are con-
ducted with small budgets. That means for us to
have selected corpora that contain the desired re-
sults. For instance, in a campaign for topical cat-
egorization, we must start with a topically tagged
corpus. By so doing, we also can, at the end of
a campaign, compare results from human judges
with results from competitors, using an identical

In this paper, we describe experiments we per-
formed with human judgments when preparing
DEFT campaigns. We survey the various steps
in the preparation of the last two campaigns, and
we go through the detail of how human evalua-
tion, performed during these steps, led us to the
parametrization of these two campaigns. We also
present a comparative analysis of results found by
human judges and results submitted by competi-
tors in the challenge. We conclude about the rel-
evance of the human evaluation of a task, prior to
evaluating software dedicated to this task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999722">
We were competitors in the 2005 and 2006 edi-
tions, and became organisators for the 2007 and
2008 campaigns. For both challenges that we or-
ganized, we went through the classical steps of the
evaluation paradigm (Adda et al., 1999), to which
we systematically added a step of human test of the
task, in order to adjust those parameters that could
be modified. The steps, therefore, are following:

Whenever human judges have to evaluate the
results of participants in a campaign, the main
problems are about correctly defining the judging
criteria to be applied by judges, and that judges
be in sufficient number to vote on judging each
document. Hovy et al. (2002) describe work to-
ward formalization of software evaluation method-
ology in NLP, developed in the EAGLES5 and

ISLE6 projects. For cost-efficiency reasons, au-
tomatic evaluation is relevant, and its results have
sometimes been compared to results from human
judges. For instance, Eck and Hori (2005) com-
pare results of evaluation measurements used in
automatic translation with human judgments on
the same corpus. In (Burstein and Wolska, 2003),
the authors describe an experiment in the evalua-
tion of writing style and find a better agreement
between the automatic evaluation system and one
human judge, than between two human judges.
Returning to the DEFT campaign, once the task
is chosen, the corpora are collected, and evaluation
measurements are defined, there can remain some
necessity of adjusting parameters, according to the
expected difficulty of the task. This could be, for
instance, the level of granularity in a task of top-
ical segmentation, or which categories should be
relevant in a task of categorization. To get this ad-
justing done, we submit the task to human judges.
In 2007, the challenge was about the automatic
affectation of opinion values to texts developing an
argumented judgment (Grouin et al., 2007). We
collected opinion texts already tagged by an opin-
ion value, such as film reviews that, in addition
to a text giving the judgment of the critic on the
film, also feature a mark in the shape of a variable
number of stars. The adjustable parameter of the
task, therefore, is the scale of opinion values. The
task will be more or less difficult, according to the
range of this scale.
The 2008 campaign was about classifying a set
of documents by genre and topic (Hurault-Plantet
et al., 2008). The choice of genres and topics is
a crucial one. Some pairs of topics or genres are
more difficult to separate than other ones. We also
had to find different genres sharing a set of topical
categories, while corpora in French are not so very
abundant. So we selected two genres, encyclo-
pedia and daily newspaper, and about ten general
topical categories. The parameter we had to ad-
just was the set of categories to be matched against
each other.

In 2007, the challenge was about the automatic af-
fectation of opinion values to texts developing an
argumented judgment. In view of that, we col-
lected four corpora that covered various domains:

reviews of films and books, of video games and of
scientific papers, as well as parliamentary debates
about a draft law.
Each corpus had the interesting feature of com-
bining a mark or opinion with a descriptive text, as
the mark was used to sum up the judment in the
argumentative part of this text. Due to the diver-
sity of sources, we found as many marking scales
as involved copora:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9286444375">
• 2 values for parliamentary debates7 (the rep-
resentative who took part in the debate was
either in favour or in disfavour of the draft
law) ;
• 4 values for scientific paper reviews (accepted
as it stands – accepted with minor changes
– accepted with major changes and second
overall reviewing –rejected), based on a set of
criteria including interestingness, relevance
and originality of the paper’s content ;
• 5 values for film and book reviews8 (a mark
between 0 and 4, from bad to excellent) ;
• 20 values for video game reviews9 (a global
mark calculated from a set of advices about
various aspects of the game: graphics, playa-
bility, life span, sound track and scenario).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998685">
In order to, first, assess the feasibility of the task,
and to, secondly, define the scale of values to be
used in the evaluation campaign, we submitted hu-
man judges to several tests (Paek, 2001): they were
instructed to assign a mark on two kinds of scale, a
wide one with the original values, and a restricted
one with 2 or 3 values, depending on the corpus it
was applying to. The results from various judges
were evaluated in terms of precision and recall, and
matched to each other by way of the Kappa coeffi-
cient (Carletta, 1996) (Cohen, 1960).
We present hereunder the values of the κ coef-
ficient between pairs of human judges, and with
the reference, on the video game corpus. The wide
scale (Table 1) uses the original values (marks be-
tween 0 and 20), while the restricted scale (Ta-
ble 2) relies upon 3 values with following defini-
tions: class 0 for original marks between 0 and 10,
class 1 for marks between 11 and 14, and class 2
for marks between 15 and 20.

Table 1 and 2 show that agreement between
judges varies widely when marking scales are
modified. Table 1 shows that there is an insuffi-
cient agreement among judges on the wide scale,
with κ coefficients lower than 0.20, while the
agreement between these same judges can be con-
sidered as good on the restricted scale, with κ co-
efficients between 0.54 and 0.79 (Table 2), the me-
dian being at 0.74.
In order to confirm the validity of the change
in scales, we used the κ to test how each judge
agreed with himself, between his two sets of re-
sults (Table 3). Therefore, we compared judg-
ments made by each judge using the initial value
scale and converted towards the restricted scale,
with judgments made by the same judge directly
using the restricted value scale. This measurement
shows the degree of correspondence between both
scales for each judge. Among the three judges who
took part in the test, the first and third one agree
well with themselves, while for the second one, the
agreement is only moderate.

change was smaller, since it was from five values
to three, and not from twenty to three. For this
scale change, we merged the two lowest values (0
and 1) into one (0), and the two highest ones (3
and 4) into one (2), and the middle value in the
wide scale (2) remained the intermediate one in
the restricted scale (1). This scale change was the
most relevant one, since, with 29.7% of the docu-
ments, the class of the middle mark (2) accounted
for almost one third of the corpus. However, the
two other groups of documents are less well bal-
anced. Indeed, the lowest mark concerns less doc-
uments than the highest one: 4.6% and 10.3% re-
spectively for the initial marks 0 and 1, while one
finds 39.8% and 15.6% of documents for the marks
3 and 4. Grouping the documents in only two
classes, by joining the middle class with the two
lowest ones, would have yielded a better balance
between classes, with 44.6% of documents for the
lower mark and 55.4% for the higher one, but that
would have been less meaningful.
Results from human judges are shown in the Ta-
bles 4 and 5 for both scales.

Agreements between human judges ranked from
bad to moderate for the wide scale (the five origi-
nal values in this corpus), while these agreements
rank from insufficient to good in the case of the
restricted scale with three values. We can see that
differences induced by the scale change are much
less important than with the video game corpus.
This agrees well with the scales being much closer
to each other.
By first performing a hand-made evaluation, and
secondly, matching between themselves the results
from the judges, we found a way to assess with
greater precision the difficulty of the evaluation
task we were about to launch. Concerning the
first two review corpora (films and books, video
games), we attached values good, average and bad
to the three selected classes. The scale for sci-
entific paper reviews was also restricted to three
classes for which following values were selected:
paper accepted as it stands or with minor edits, pa-
per accepted after major edits, paper rejected. Fi-
nally, since its original scale had only two values,
the corpus of parliamentary debates underwent no
change of scale.

3.2 Choice of a topical category set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997871">
In order to determine which topical categories
should be recognized in the 2008 task of classify-
ing documents by genre and topic, we performed a
manual evaluation of a sample of the corpus with 4
human judges. The sample included 30 Le Monde
papers for the journalistic genre, and 30 Wikipedia
entries for the encyclopedic genre. Only the title
and body of each article was kept in the sample,
and the tables were deleted. All marks of inclu-
sion in either corpus were also deleted (references
to Le Monde and Wikipedia tags).
The test ran this way: each article was put in a
separate file, and the evaluators had to identify the
genre and the topical category under which it was
published. All articles were included in one set,
which means evaluators had to choose, between all
categories and genres, which ones to match with
each document. This test was made with a first
selection of 8 categories, shared by both genres,
listed in Table 6.
Table 7 shows that results from human judges
in terms of precision and recall were excellent on
the identification of genre (F-scores between 0.94
and 1.00) and quite good on the identification of
categories (F-scores between 0.66 and 0.82).
We also proceeded to the pairwise matching of
results from human judges via the κ coefficient.
Results show an excellent agreement of judges
among themselves and with the reference for genre
identification (Table 8). The agreement is mod-

These good results led us to keep the corpora as
they stood, since they appeared to constitute a
good reference for the defined task. However, we
made an exception for category Notebook (biogra-
phies of celebrities) which we discarded for two
reasons. First, it is more of a genre, namely, ”bi-
ography”, rather than a topical category. Secondly,
we found it rather difficult to assign a single cate-
gory to articles which could belong in two different
ones, as would be the case for the biography of a
sportsman, which would fall under both categories

cluded two subtasks, one being genre and topic
recognition for a first set of categories, the other
one being only topic recognition for a second set
of categories. Therefore, the corpus had to be di-
vided in two parts. In order to find which cate-
gories had to go into which subcorpus, we decided
to estimate, for each category, the difficulty of rec-
ognizing it. To do so, we calculated the precision
and recall of each evaluator for each category. This
measurement was obtained via a second evaluation
of human judges, with a wider set of categories (by
adding categories Art and Literature).
The ordering of categories by decreasing pre-
cision is following: Sport (1.00), International
(0.80), France (0.76), Literature (0.76), Art (0.74),
Television (0.71), Economy (0.58), Science (0.33),
Society (0.26). This means no document in the
Sport category was misclassified, and, contrari-
wise, categories Science and Society were the most
problematic ones.
The ordering by decreasing recall is slightly
different: International (0.87), Economy (0.80),
Sport (0.75), France (0.70), Art (0.62), Literature
(0.49), Television (0.46), Society (0.42), Science
(0.33). Hence, articles in the International cate-
gory were best identified. This ordering also con-
firms the difficulty felt by human judges concern-
ing the categories Society and Science.
We decided to distribute the categories for each
subtask according to a balance between easy and
diffucult ones in terms of human evaluation:

together three categories which are topically
close (France, International and Society).

The 2007 edition of DEFT highlighted two main
phenomena concerning the corpora involved in the
task.
First, each corpus yielded a different level of dif-
ficulty, and this gradation of difficulty among cor-
pora appeared both for human evaluators and com-
petitors in the challenge (Paroubek et al., 2007).

between human evaluators and competitors in the
challenge, 2007 edition.
During human tests, judges mentioned the great
facility of finding about opinions expressed in the
corpus of parliamentary debate. Next came cor-
pora of video game reviews, and then of film and
book reviews, whose difficulty was considered av-
erage, and last, the corpus of scientific paper re-
views, which the judges perceived as particularly
difficult. This gradation of difficulty among cor-
pora was also found among competitors, following
the same ordering of three levels of difficulty.
Secondly, the difficulties met by human eval-
uators are also found in the case of competitors.
Upon finishing human tests, judges felt difficulties
in evaluating the corpus of scientific paper reviews,
yielding poor results. Now, the results of competi-
tors on the same corpus are quite as poor, occupy-
ing exactly the same value interval as for human
judges. Most competitors, by the way, obtained
their worst results on this corpus.
The alikeness of results between judges and
competitors reflects the complexity of the corpus:
when preparing the campaign, we observed that
reviews were quite short. Therefore, assigning a
value had to rely upon a small amount of data.
From that, we can derive a minimal size for docu-
ments to be used in this kind of evaluation. More-
over, a paper review can be seen as an aid for the
author, to be expressed as positively as possible,
even if it is also addressed to the Program Commit-
tee which has to accept or reject the paper. There-
fore, the mark could prove more negative than the
text of the review.
The case of comments about videogames is a
different one. Indeed, giving a global mark on a
scale of 20 is a difficult task. Therefore, this mark
comes most often from a sum of smaller marks
which rate either the whole document according
to various criteria, or parts of this document. In
our corpus, each reviewer rates the game accord-
ing to several criteria, namely, graphics, playa-
bility, life span, sound track and scenario, from
which a rather long text is produced, making the
judgment an easier task to perform. However, the
global mark differs from the sum of the smaller
ones from various criteria, hence the difficulty for
human judges to reckon this global mark on a scale
of 20.

4.2 Confirmation of the expected success of
competitors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991228125">
Contrary to the 2007 edition, in which competi-
tors obtained results that confirmed those of human
judges, the 2008 edition gave them the opportunity
to reach a higher level than human evaluators.
While genre identification yielded no special
problem, either for human evaluators or for com-
petitors, and the results obtained by both groups
are similar, competitors reached better results than
human judges in topical categorization.
Concerning genre identification, strict F-scores
are situated between 0.94 and 1.00 for human
judges, and between 0.95 and 0.98 for the best
runs of competitors (each competitor was allowed
to submit up to three collections of results, only
the best one being used for the final ranking). As
for topical categorization, strict F-scores go from
0.66 to 0.82 for human evaluators, and from 0.84
to 0.89 for best runs from competitors.
The equivalence of results on genre identifica-
tion between judges and competitors can be ex-
plained by the fact that it was a simple, binary
choice (the newspaper Le Monde vs. Wikipedia).
Contrariwise, competitors obtained better re-
sults in topical categorization, since machines have
a stronger abstraction capacity than humans in
presence of the 9 topical categories we defined
(Art, Economy, France, International, Literature,
Science, Society, Sport and Television). However,
conditions were not quite similar, since human
judges had to pick a category among eight, and
not, like the automatic systems, a category within
two subsets of four and five categories. Indeed,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999987272727273">
we dispatched the categories into two sets, by bal-
ancing categories that are easy or difficult for hu-
man evaluators. For the second set of categories,
we carefully put together three semantically close
ones, (France, International and Society, all three
of them being about political and societal con-
tents), to make the task more difficult. Although
the second set of categories seems more compli-
cated for human judges, half of the competitors ob-
tained better results in topical categorization of the
second set than of the first one.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893047619048">
The relevance of human judgment in an evaluation
campaign is present from the beginning to the end
of a campaign.
In a first step, testing a topic for a campaign
among a limited number of human evaluators al-
lows us to check the feasibility of a task. This
checking relies both on the results obtained by
judges (recall, precision, F-scores) and on their
personal impressions after passing the test.
In a second step, the study of both the results ob-
tained by the judges, and their pairwise matching
involving such a comparator as the κ coefficient
allows us to adjust the task (choice of a marking
scale for DEFT’07 and selection of topical cate-
gories for DEFT’08).
Finally, the mutual comparison of competitors’
results, at the end of the evaluation campaign, al-
lows us to validate the choices we made at its start-
ing point, and even to reposition the task when we
shall launch a future campaign based on the same
topic.

Human judgment was used during the preparation of the last two campaigns, to assess the difficulty of the task, and to see which parameters could be modified. To do this, before the participants start competing via their software, we put human judges in front of versions of the task with various sets of parameters. This allows us to adjust the definition of the task according to which difficulties were encountered, and how judges agree together. These human judges are in small number, and belong to our team.
