1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999191">
The resolution of bridging references is certainly highly interrelated with the
computation of discourse relations as well as with the integration of world
knowledge into the interpretation of a discourse. In what follows we present
examples which clearly corroborate this fact; the following example is taken
from [4]:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.635498">
Example 1.1 John entered the room. He saw the chandelier sparkling brightly.
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999541777777778">
In this example, the resolution of the bridging reference the chandelier
depends on the discourse relation by which the second sentence is attached to
the first. In fact, assuming that we can not see objects in a room if we are
not in it, the chandelier can only be linked to the room in the first sentence
if the seeing event follows the entering event, i.e. only if the temporal order
imposed by the corresponding discourse relation preserves the surface order.
In particular, inferring Narration or Result (cf. [9]) would be consistent with
the resolution, while Explanation would not. Now let&apos;s consider the following
example:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.452434">
Example 1.2 John entered the room. He saw the chandelier through the window.
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997374">
Provided that the window is resolved as being part of the room and as-
suming that we can only see objects through a window which are not in the
same room, the definite description the chandelier can only be resolved as be-
longing to the room if the seeing event precedes the entering of the room the
chandelier belongs to. In this case thus Explanation would be a valid discourse
relation, while Narration and Result would not.
The above examples clearly show how the computation of discourse rela-
tions, world knowledge and bridging reference resolution constrain each other.
The following example consisting in a minimal pair also involves temporal
aspects and has been discussed in [2] and later in [6]:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.342377333333333">
Example 1.3
a. John arrived at the oasis. The camels are standing under the palms.
b. John arrived at the oasis. The camels were standing under the palms.
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.971008333333333">
The point here is that the camels in the second discourse can not be re-
solved as being the means of transport by which John arrived as the use of the
imperfect shows a preference for interpreting the state in the second sentence

as temporally overlapping with the arrival (compare [8] and [6]), which would
yield an inconsistency as the camels would not be at the oasis as well as be
at the oasis at overlapping states. The resolution of the camel as being the
means of transport by which John arrived should thus be prohibited by any
account of bridging reference resolution.
In general we have to conclude that the resolution of a bridging reference
has to be consistent with world knowledge as well as with the consequences
introduced by certain discourse relations as well as by tense information. In or-
der to model the information flow between bridging reference resolution, world
knowledge, tense information and the computation of discourse relations, in
this paper we present a declarative first-order account in which bridging ref-
erence resolution is a byproduct of building a minimal model of a discourse as
in [5], which thus is also consistent with world knowledge as well as the impli-
cations of a certain (inferred) discourse relation. Our approach is in line with
the approaches of Gardent and Konrad [5] as well as Hobbs et al. [7] in that
minimality is the driving principle of discourse interpretation. In contrast to
[2], we rely on FOL in our approach. In our view, there is in fact no obvious
reason why discourse interpretation should actually be decidable. For further
motivation about why minimal models are interesting as well as for a more
detailed overview of related work, the interested reader is referred to [3].
2 Ingredients of the logical theory
The logical theory for which we want to find a minimal model consists of the
following parts: i) a description of the input discourse, ii) discourse principles,
iii) axioms on discourse relations, iv) tense and temporal axioms, and v) world
knowledge. We describe each of these components in the following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.759848">
2.1 Input discourse
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993482125">
The input discourse constitutes the variable part of the theory as it varies for
each discourse we want to analyze. The input description of the discourse in
particular states the surface order of the involved events. Let&apos;s for example
consider example (1), for which the input description looks as follows, where
denotes the surface order of events:
]e, , j, r, c enter(e) A agent(e, A patient(e, A event(e) A past(e) A
per f ect(e) A room(r) A see(e&apos;) A agent(e&apos; , A patient(e&apos; , A
state(e&apos;) A past(e&apos;) A per f ect(e&apos;) A chandelier(c) A e
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.917603">
2.2 Discourse Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999865">
It has been argued especially by Asher et al. [2] and furthermore become
the main point in SDRT, that discourse segments need to be connected to
previous discourse segments by some rhetorical relation. We axiomatize this
in our theory as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.908221">
Definition 2.1 (Discourse Connectedness)
V e eventuality(e) ]et (et e A eventuality(e&apos;) A dconnected(e&apos; , e))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99922525">
That means, each event has to be discourse connected to some previously
mentioned event (according to the surface order of events). This is in line with
the approaches of [7] and [9]. Now we only have to define what dconnected
means:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6853945">
Definition 2.2 (Discourse Relations)
Ve, e&apos; dconnected(e, e&apos;) ---&gt; dr el (e, et, ri) V ... V drel (e , e&apos;, rn)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99939525">
where r1...rn are constants representing the discourse relations described in
[2] such as Narration, Parallel, Result, Explanation, Elaboration, Background,
etc. So, in contrast to the work in [2] we are treating discourse relations as
first-order constants instead of relations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.951791">
2.3 Axioms on Discourse Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999375">
Further, we need to define axioms specifying the spatio-temporal consequences
of a given discourse relation. For the purposes of this paper, we will need
temporal consequences on narration, result and explanation (compare [9]) as
well as the spatial consequences on narration in [2].
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.766856">
2.4 Tense and Temporal Axioms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898842105263">
Kamp has argued in [8] that the simple past — Passe Simple, as he discusses
it for French — is typically used to report the successive elements of the main
course of action of a story, while the imperfect serves to present the setting
in which the action is taking place. In particular, Kamp presents a procedure
([8], p405) describing how a sentence in the perfect or in the imperfect relate
to the preceding discourse. The procedure basically states the following: an
event reported in the imperfect overlaps with all preceding events in imperfect
until the first event reported in the perfect is encountered. The former ones
are thus interpreted as describing the circumstances under which the punctual
event (reported in the perfect) occurred. This is not the case, for the perfect,
for which Kamp claims that a succession of sentences in the perfect convey a
similar temporal order of the reported events.
The second principle is probably to strong to be axiomatized (as temporal
order does not always correspond to the surface order). Thus, we only ax-
iomatize the first principle on the imperfect. Before, however, we need to
introduce the notion of overlap e between eventualities. In fact, we will in-
troduce a function ef denoting the intersection between two eventualities.
Further, we will have a special sign I denoting the empty intersection. The
corresponding predicate EN is then defined in terms of ef as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.939732909090909">
Definition 2.3 (ep)

C&apos; e&amp;quot; e) —&gt; et EDp e)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255571428571">
Further, we will have a homogeneity axiom similar to the one proposed
in [1] stating that if a condition P holds at the eventuality e, then it also
holds for any part of e. The way in which we express this is by saying that
for any overlapping eventuality e&apos; the conditions of e hold in particular at the
intersection of e and e&apos;. The following axiom is actually an axiom schema
which needs to be instantiated for all different conditions which can hold at a
given eventuality:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.612345">
Definition 2.5 (Homogeneity)
Ve, e&apos; e EDp et A P(e) P(e ED f et)
Ve, et e ED p et A —iP(e) —iP(e ED f e&apos;)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988254">
Further, for events in general we assume the existence of an event nucleus
structure as in [10] consisting of a preparatory and a consequent phase.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9303815">
Definition 2.6 (Nucleus)

Ve, e&apos;, e&amp;quot; e&amp;quot; EDp e A et E nucleus(e) e&amp;quot; ep (NucleusOverlap)
</equation>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.84845">
2.5 World Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999865">
The last ingredient in our logical theory are axioms encoding world knowledge.
Besides having axioms encoding a concept hierarchy with the corresponding
disjointness axioms, most importantly we will have axioms describing pre-
conditions and effects of events. The axioms needed for the purposes of this
paper are shown in Figure 1. It is important to note that most of the above
axioms should actually be formulated in a non-monotonic fashion, i.e. it is
only normally the case that if we see something through a window, the object
in question is in another room. However, a non-monotonic knowledge repre-
sentation and reasoning scheme is out of the scope of this paper. We refer the
interested reader to [9].

Spatial Consequences on Narration: e &lt; e&apos; and l loc(st, j, Aloc(e&apos; , j, l).
Assume that e and e&apos; are connected by Result; then we get with Conse-
quences on Result: e lxi e&apos; A cause(e, e&apos;) and thus s&apos; EE e&apos; (Left Abut),
i.e. John&apos;s being in the room overlaps with the seeing.
Assume that e and e&apos; are connected by Explanation; then we get with Con-
sequences on Explanation: e&apos; DC e A cause(e&apos; , e) and thus s EE e&apos; (Left
Abut), the latter leading to a contradiction as s and e&apos; have contradictory
conditions. In fact, it holds that —i/oc(s ef , j, r) (from 4 above and Homo-
geneity) as well as /oc(s ef e&apos;, j, r) (from 3, 5 and 6 above, /oc is functional
and Homogeneity), which clearly results in a contradiction due to the fact
that /oc is functional. Thus, assuming that the chandelier is interpreted as
belonging to the room, Explanation can not be inferred as discourse rela-
tion while Result and Narration are consistent with the assumption that the
chandelier belongs to the room mentioned in the first sentence. Given these
explanations, example 1.2 is easy to explain. In example 1.2, world knowledge
implies that neither Result nor Narration can be inferred because in both cases
a state s in which the condition /oc(s, j, r) holds would yield a contradiction
with seeing through a window implies different locations. In fact, the
discourse relations Result or Narration can only be predicted in example 1.2
if the chandelier is accommodated with the result that the model would not
be minimal anymore. For example 1.3 b, we assume the following input:
]e, , j, o,e, p arrive_at(e) A agent(e, j) A patient(e, o) A
event(e) A past(e) A per f eet(e) A oasis(o) A camels(c) A
under (e&apos; , e,p) A state(e&apos;) A past(e) A prog (e) A palms (p)
Assuming that the palms are resolved as belonging to the oasis, we yield the
following inferences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.804994625">
1. loc(e&apos; , p, o) and thus loc(e&apos; , c, o) (Location)
2. dconnected(e, e&apos;) (Event Connectedness)
3. drel(e, e&apos;, narration) V ... V drel(e, e&apos;, result) (Discourse Relations)
4. Se&amp;quot; travel _to(e&amp;quot; , j, o) A e&amp;quot; E prep(e) A e&amp;quot; ixi e (Arriving implies traveling &amp; Prep)

<bodyText confidence="0.989953">
Thus we get an inconsistency in every model which identifies the camels c
with the mode of transport in. This inconsistency is due to the fact that John

We have presented an approach to bridging reference resolution taking into
account the information flow between a certain resolution, the computation of
discourse relations as well as linguistic and world knowledge. In our approach
this information flow is declarative and emerges as a byproduct of building a

For the purposes of this paper, we will need temporal consequences on narration, result and explanation (compare [9]) as well as the spatial consequences on narration in [2]. 2.4 Tense and Temporal Axioms Kamp has argued in [8] that the simple past — Passe Simple, as he discusses it for French — is typically used to report the successive elements of the main course of action of a story, while the imperfect serves to present the setting in which the action is taking place. In particular, Kamp presents a procedure ([8], p405) describing how a sentence in the perfect or in the imperfect relate to the preceding discourse. The procedure basically states the following: an event reported in the imperfect overlaps with all preceding events in imperfect until the first ev</context>

We describe each of these components in the following sections. 2.1 Input discourse The input discourse constitutes the variable part of the theory as it varies for each discourse we want to analyze.

In this example, the resolution of the bridging reference the chandelier depends on the discourse relation by which the second sentence is attached to the first. In fact, assuming that we can not see objects in a room if we are not in it, the chandelier can only be linked to the room in the first sentence if the seeing event follows the entering event, i.e. only if the temporal order imposed by the corresponding discourse relation preserves the surface order. In particular, inferring Narration or Result (cf. [9]) would be consistent with the resolution, while Explanation would not. Now let&apos;s consider the following example: Example 1.2 John entered the room. He saw the chandelier through the window. Provided that the window is resolved as being part of the room and assuming that we can only see objects through a window which are not in the same room, the definite description the chandelier can only be resolved as belonging to the room if the seeing event precedes the entering of the room the chandelier belongs to.

It is important to note that most of the above axioms should actually be formulated in a non-monotonic fashion, i.e. it is only normally the case that if we see something through a window, the object in question is in another room. However, a non-monotonic knowledge representation and reasoning scheme is out of the scope of this paper. We refer the interested reader to [9]. 3 Application to Examples Let&apos;s start the discussion of example 1.1.
