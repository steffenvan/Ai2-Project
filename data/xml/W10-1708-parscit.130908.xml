Abstract

We describe our hybrid machine trans-
lation system which has been developed
for and used in the WMT10 shared task.
We compute translations from a rule-
based MT system and combine the re-
sulting translation “templates” with par-
tial phrases from a state-of-the-art phrase-
based, statistical MT engine. Phrase sub-
stitution is guided by several decision
factors, a continuation of previous work
within our group. For the shared task,
we have computed translations for six lan-
guage pairs including English, German,
French and Spanish. Our experiments
have shown that our shallow substitu-
tion approach can effectively improve the
translation result from the RBMT system;
however it has also become clear that a
deeper integration is needed to further im-
prove translation quality.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995440976744186">
In recent years the quality of machine translation
(MT) output has improved greatly, although each
paradigm suffers from its own particular kind of
errors: statistical machine translation (SMT) of-
ten shows poor syntax, while rule-based engines
(RBMT) experience a lack in vocabulary. Hybrid
systems try to avoid these typical errors by com-
bining techniques from both paradigms in a most
useful manner.
In this paper we present the improved version of
the hybrid system we developed last year’s shared
task (Federmann et al., 2009). We take the out-
put from an RBMT engine as basis for our hybrid
translations and substitute noun phrases by trans-
lations from an SMT engine. Even though a gen-
eral increase in quality could be observed, our sys-
tem introduced errors of its own during the substi-
tution process. In an internal error analysis, these
degradations were classified as follows:
- the translation by the SMT engine is incorrect
- the structure degrades through substitution
(because of e.g. capitalization errors, double
prepositions, etc.)
- the phrase substitution goes astray (caused by
alignment problems, etc.)
Errors of the first class cannot be corrected, as
we have no way of knowing when the translation
by the SMT engine is incorrect. The other two
classes could be eliminated, however, by introduc-
ing additional steps for pre- and post-processing
as well as improving the hybrid algorithm itself.
Our current error analysis based on the results of
this year’s shared task does not show these types
of errors anymore.
Additionally, we extended our coverage to also
include the language pairs EnglishHFrench and
EnglishHSpanish in both directions as well as
English—*German, compared to last year’s initial
experiments for German—*English only. We were
able to achieve an increase in translation quality
for this language set, which shows that the substi-
tution method works for different language config-
urations.

Our hybrid translation system takes translation
output from a) the Lucy RBMT system (Alonso
and Thurmair, 2003) and b) a Moses-based SMT
system (Koehn et al., 2007). We then identify
noun phrases inside the rule-based translation and
compute the most likely correspondences in the
statistical translation output. For these, we apply a
factored substitution method that decides whether
the original RBMT phrase should be kept or rather
be replaced by the Moses phrase. As this shallow
substitution process may introduce problems at

2.1 Input to the Hybrid System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991432">
Lucy RBMT System We obtain the translation
as well as linguistic structures from the RBMT
system. An internal evaluation has shown that
these structures are usually of a high quality which
supports our initial decision to consider the RBMT
output as an appropriate “template” for our hybrid
translation approach. The Lucy translation output
can include additional markup that allows to iden-
tify unknown words or other, local phenomena.
The Lucy system is a transfer-based MT system
that performs translation in three phases, namely
analysis, transfer, and generation. Intermediate
tree structures for each of the translation phases
can be extracted from the Lucy system to guide
the hybrid system. Sadly, only the 1-best path
through these three phases is given, so no alterna-
tive translation possibilities can be extracted from
the given data; a fact that clearly limits the poten-
tial for more deeply integrated hybrid translation
approaches. Nevertheless, the availability of the
1-best trees already allows to improve the transla-
tion quality of the RBMT system as we will show
in this paper.
Moses SMT System We used a state-of-the-art
Moses SMT system to create statistical phrase-
based translations of our input text. Moses has
been modified so that it returns the translation re-
sults together with the bidirectional word align-
ments between the source texts and the transla-
tions. Again, we make use of markup which helps
to identify unknown words as these will later guide
the factored substitution method. Both of the
translation models and the language models within
our SMT systems were only trained with lower-
cased and tokenized Europarl training data. The
system used sets of feature weights determined us-
ing data sets also from Europarl (test2008). In
addition, we used LDC gigaword corpus to train
large scale n-gram language models to be used in
our hybrid system. We tokenized the source texts
using the standard tokenizers available from the
shared task website. The SMT translations are re-
cased before being fed into the hybrid system to-
gether with the word alignment information.The
hybrid system can easily be adapted to support
other statistical translation engines. If the align-
ment information is not available, a suitable align-
ment tool would be necessary to compute it as the
alignment is a key requirement for the hybrid sys-
tem.

2.2 Aligning RBMT and SMT Output
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99934455">
We compute alignment in several components of
the hybrid system, namely:
source-text-to-tree: we first find an alignment
between the source text and the correspond-
ing analysis tree(s). As Lucy tends to sub-
divide large sentences into several smaller
units, it sometimes becomes necessary to
align more than one tree structure to a given
source sentence.
analysis-transfer-generation: for each of the
analysis trees, we re-construct the path from
its tree nodes, via the transfer tree, and their
corresponding generation tree nodes.
tree-to-target-text: similarly to the first align-
ment process, we find a mapping between
generation tree nodes and the actual transla-
tion output of the RBMT system.
source-text-to-tokenized: as the Lucy RBMT
system works on non-tokenized input text
and our Moses system takes tokenized input,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991304">
78
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997821761904762">
we need to align the source text to its tok-
enized form.
Given the aforementioned alignments, we can then
correlate phrases from the rule-based translation
with their counterparts from the statistical trans-
lation, both on source or target side. As our
hybrid approach relies on the identification of
such phrase pairs, the computation of the different
alignments is critical to obtain good combination
performance.
Please note that all these tree-based alignments
can be computed with a very high accuracy. How-
ever, due to the nature of statistical word align-
ment, the same does not hold for the alignment
obtained from the Moses system. If the alignment
process has produced erroneous phrase tables, it is
very likely that Lucy phrases and their “aligned”
SMT matches simply will not fit. Or put the other
way round: the better the underlying SMT word
alignment, the greater the potential of the hybrid
substitution approach.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989081">
2.3 Factored Substitution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999771368421053">
Given the results of the alignment process, we can
then identify “interesting” phrases for substitution.
Following our experimental setup from last year’s
shared task, we again decided to focus on noun
phrases as these seem to be best-suited for in-place
swapping of phrases. Our initial assumption is that
SMT phrases are better on a lexical level, hence
we aim to replace Lucy’s noun phrases by their
Moses counterparts.
Still, we want to perform the substitution in a
controlled manner in order to avoid problems or
non-matching insertions. For this, we have (man-
ually) derived a set of factors that are checked for
each of the phrase pairs that are processed. The
factors are described briefly below:
identical? simply checks whether two candidate
phrases are identical.
too complex? a Lucy phrase is “too complex”
to substitute if it contains more than 2
embedded noun phrases.
many-to-one? this factor checks if a Lucy phrase
containing more than one word is mapped to
a Moses phrase with only one token.
contains pronoun? checks if the Lucy phrase
contains a pronoun.
contains verb? checks if the Lucy phrase con-
tains a verb.
unknown? checks whether one of the phrases is
marked as “unknown”.
length mismatch computes the number of words
for both phrases and checks if the absolute
difference is too large.
language model computes language model
scores for both phrases and checks which is
more likely according to the LM.
All of these factors have been designed and ad-
justed during an internal development phase using
data from previous shared tasks.

2.4 Post-processing Steps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997845">
After the hybrid translation has been computed,
we perform several post-processing steps to clean
up and finalize the result:
cleanup first, we perform basic cleanup opera-
tions such as whitespace normalization, cap-
italizing the first word in each sentence, etc.
multi-words then, we take care of proper han-
dling of multi-word expressions. Using the
tree structures from the RBMT system we
eliminate superfluous whitespace and join
multi-words, even if they were separated in
the SMT phrase.
prepositions finally, we give prepositions a spe-
cial treatment. Experience from last year’s
shared task had shown that things like double
prepositions contributed to a large extent to
the amount of avoidable errors. We tried to
circumvent this class of error by identifying
the correct prepositions; erroneous preposi-
tions are removed.

We evaluated the intermediate outputs using
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) against human refer-
ences as in table 3. The BLEU score is calculated
in lower case after the text tokenization. The trans-
lation systems compared are Moses, Lucy, Google
and our hybrid system with different configura-
tions:
Hybrid: we use the language model with case
information and substitute some NPs in Lucy
outputs by Moses outputs.
Hybrid LLM: same as Hybrid but we use a
larger language model.

We participated in the translation evaluation in
six language pairs: German to English (de-*en),
English to German (en-*de), French to English
(fr-*en), English to French (en-*fr), Spanish to
English (es-*en) and English to Spanish (en-*es).
As shown in table 3, the Moses translation sys-
tem achieves better results overall than the Lucy
system does. Google’s system outperforms other
systems in all language pairs. The hybrid transla-
tion as described in section 2 improves the Lucy
translation quality with a BLEU score up to 2.7%
absolutely.
As we apply a larger language model or a lan-
guage model without case information, the trans-
lation performance can be improved further. One
major problem in the hybrid translation is that the
Moses outputs are still not good enough to replace
the Lucy outputs, therefore we experimented on
a hybrid translation of Google and Lucy systems
and substitute some unrelaible NP translations by
the Google’s translations. The results in the line
of ’Hybrid SG’ shows that the hybrid translation
quality can be enhanced if the translation system
where we select substitutions is better.

4 Internal Evaluation of Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998321818181818">
In the analysis of the remaining issues, the fol-
lowing main sources of problems can be distin-
guished:
- Lucy’s output contains structural errors that
cannot be fixed by the chosen approach.
- Lucy results contain errors that could have
been corrected by alternative expressions
from SMT, but the constraints in our system
were too restrictive to let that happen.
- The SMT engine we use generates subopti-
mal results that find their way into the hybrid
result.
- SMT results that are good are incorporated
into the hybrid results in a wrong way.
We have inspected a part of the results and classi-
fied the problems according to these criteria. As
this work is still ongoing, it is too early to report
numerical results for the relative frequencies of the
different causes of the error. However, we can
already see that three of these four cases appear
frequently enough to justify further attention. We
observed several cases in which the parser in the
Lucy system was confused by unknown expres-
sions and delivered results that could have been
significantly improved by a more robust parsing
approach. We also encountered several cases in
which an expression from SMT was used although
the original Lucy output would have been better.
Also we still observe problems finding to correct
correspondences between Lucy output and SMT
output, which leads to situations where material is
inserted in the wrong place, which can lead to the
loss of content words in the output.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

<bodyText confidence="0.999994272727273">
In our contribution to the shared task we have ap-
plied the hybrid architecture from (Federmann et
al., 2009) to six language pairs. We have identi-
fied and fixed many of the problems we had ob-
served last year, and we think that, in addition to
the increased coverage in laguage pairs, the overall
quality has been significantly increased.
However, in the last section we characterized
three main sources of problems that will require
further attention. We will address these problems
in the near future in the following way:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989189">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991891727272727">
1. We will investigate in more detail the align-
ment issue that leads to occasional loss of
content words, and we expect that a careful
inspection and correction of the code will in
all likelihood give us a good remedy.
2. The problem of picking expressions from the
SMT output that appear more probable to the
language model although they are inferior to
the original expression from the RBMT sys-
tem is more difficult to fix. We will try to find
better thresholds and biases that can at least
reduce the number of cases in which this type
of degradation happen.
3. Finally, we will also address the robustness
issue that leads to suboptimal structures from
the RBMT engine caused by parsing failures.
Our close collaboration with Lucy enables us to
address these issues in a very effective way via the
inspection and classification of intermediate struc-
tures and, if these structures indicate parsing prob-
lems, the generation of variants of the input sen-
tence that facilitate correct parsing.

Using the tree structures from the RBMT system we eliminate superfluous whitespace and join multi-words, even if they were separated in the SMT phrase. prepositions finally, we give prepositions a special treatment. Experience from last year’s shared task had shown that things like double prepositions contributed to a large extent to the amount of avoidable errors. We tried to circumvent this class of error by identifying the correct prepositions; erroneous prepositions are removed. 3 Hybrid Translation Analysis We evaluated the intermediate outputs using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) against human references as in table 3. The BLEU score is calculated in lower case after the text tokenization. The translation systems compared are Moses, Lucy, Google and our hybrid system with different configurations: Hybrid: we use the language model with case information and substitute some NPs in Lucy outputs by Moses outputs. Hybrid LLM: same as Hybrid but we use a larger language model. 79 Table 1: Intermediate results of BLEU[%] scores for WMT10 shared task.
