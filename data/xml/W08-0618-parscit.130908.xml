1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999931291666667">
Numerous studies have tackled gene and protein
names recognition (Collier et al, 2002), (Tanabe
and Wilbur, 2002). Nevertheless, drug names have
not been widely addressed (Rindflesch et al.,
2000).
Automating the process of new drugs recognition
and classification is a challenging task. With the
rapidly changing vocabulary, new drugs are
introduced while old ones are made obsolete.
Though the terminological resources are frequently
updated, they can not follow the accelerated pace
of the changing terminology.
Drug receives three distinct names: the chemical
name, the generic (or nonproprietary) name, and
the brand (or trademark) name. The U.S. Adopted
Name (USAN) Council establishes specific
nomenclature rules for naming generic drugs.
These rules rely on the use of affixes that classify
drugs according to their chemical structure,
indication or mechanism of action. For example,
analgesics substances can receive affixes such as
-adol-, -butazone, -�enine, -eridine and fentanil.
In the present work, we focus, particulary, on the
implementation of a set of 531 affixes approved by

affixes allow a specific classification of drugs on
pharmacological families, which ULMS Semantic
NetWork is unable to provide.

2 The System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963615384616">
The system consists of four main modules: a basic
text processing module, WordNet look-up module,
UMLS look-up module and the USAN rules
module, as shown in Figure 1.
A corpus of 90 medical abstracts was compiled for
the experiment. For the basic processing of the
abstracts, GATE3 architecture is used. This text
processing provides sentence segmentation,
tokenization and POS tagging. Tokens which
receive a noun or proper noun POS tag are
extracted.
The nouns found on WordNet are discarded and
those which are not found in WordNet are looked
up in the UMLS Metathesaurus. If a noun is found
in UMLS, it is tagged with its corresponding
semantic types as assigned by UMLS. A subset of
these nouns is tagged as &amp;quot;drug&amp;quot; if their semantic
types are &amp;quot;Pharmacological Substance&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;Antibiotic&amp;quot;. Finally, nouns which have not been
found in UMLS are tagged as &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot;.
The list of nouns tagged as &amp;quot;drug&amp;quot; is passed to the
rule module to detect their pharmacological
families according to the affixes. In addition, the
rule module processes the list of &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; nouns
which are not found in UMLS to check the
presence of affixes, and thereby, of possible drugs.

A manual evaluation by a domain4 expert was
carried out. The list of nouns not found in
WordNet contained 1885 initial candidates. This
initial list is looked up in UMLS and 93.4% of
them (1761) is linked with some concepts of
UMLS. The UMLS module recognized 1400
nouns as pharmacological substances or
antibiotics. The rest of nouns, 361, are detected by
UMLS but neither as pharmacological substance
nor as antibiotics.
The expert manually evaluated the set of nouns
detected by UMLS as pharmacological substances
or antibiotics (1400). Evaluation showed that only
1100 were valid drugs.

The list of nouns (124) which have not been found
in UMLS are processed by the rule module to
detect new candidate drugs not included in UMLS.
This module only detects 17 candidate drugs. The
manual evaluation showed that 7 of them were
valid drugs and the rest of nouns are biomedical
concepts not included in UMLS. Some of these
drugs are Mideplanin, Tomopenem, Elvitegravir,
and so on. The rest of nouns neither detected by
the UMLS module nor by the rules module, 106,
were also validated by the expert in order to
estimate the overall coverage of our approach. The
evaluation of these nouns shows that only 7 of
them are valid drugs, however, the rest of the
nouns are named entities of the general domain
(organization, person names or cities) or
biomedical concepts. Introducing a module of
generic NER should decrease the noise caused by
such entities.
4 The authors are grateful to Maria Bedmar Segura, Manager
of the Drug Information Center, Mostoles University Hospital,
for her valuable assistance in the evaluation of the system.
Finally, precision and recall of the overall system
combining UMLS and rules were calculated. The
system achieved 78% of precision and 99.3% of
recall

3.1 The classification in pharmacological
families
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982555555556">
Once processed by the rule module, 73.8% of the
candidate drugs recognised by UMLS were also
classified in pharmacological families by the
USAN naming rules. Expert&apos;s evaluation of the
rule-based classification showed that rules
achieved 89% precision. Short affixes such as —ol,
—pin and -ox are responsible of the wrong
classifications. Thus, additional clues are necessary
to detect these drug families.

4 Some Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969571428571">
As a preliminary approach, it is a first step towards
a useful Information Extraction System in the field
of Pharmacology. Though evaluation reveals that
rules alone are not feasible enough in detecting
drugs, but they help to improve the coverage. In
addition, rules provide a drug classification in
pharmacological families. Such classification is an
added value in the development of NLP
applications within the pharmacological domain.
For future work, the approach will be extended to
address additional information about
pharmacologic classes included in many
biomedical terminologies integrated in the UMLS
such as MeSH or SNOMED.
Future work will also target a wider coverage and a
bigger set of drug types through including more
affixes, detecting complex entities (multi-words),
detecting synonyms, resolving acronyms and
ambiguities as well as using contextual information
to disambiguate the correct semantic type of each
term occurring in the texts.
