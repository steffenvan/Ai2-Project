of affairs perceived by the speaker. The relationships between
these entities will be called semantic functions. The basis for our
semantic processing scheme is a familiar one based on that of
case frames used to describe clause structure [Bruce 75]. Our
case frames are used for all phrase types: clauses, noun phrases,
prepositional phrases, etc. We choose to represent both the
syntactic and semantic analyses in the knowledge representation
language KL-ONE [Brachman&amp;Schmolze 82, Schmolze&amp;Lipkis
83, Moser 83]. The essential properties for the meaning
representations constructed are that each concept represents a
semantic constituent and each of its roles identifies the semantic
function of one of its immediate constituents. Figure 23 gives an
analysis of the example sentence above. We have picked a
constituent structure and names for semantic functions fitting the

Our framework does not assume that a syntactic analysis of
a complete sentence is found before semantic interpretation
begins. Rather, the implemented semantic interpreter proceeds
incrementally as the grammar proposes the syntactic function of
an immediate constituent; this model of communication between
syntax and semantics has been termed a cascade [Woods
80, Bobrow&amp;Webber 80b].
To achieve semantic interpretation, some well-known types
of knowledge need to be employed, e.g., selection restriction
information (often represented using semantic features),
structural information (often encoded in case frames), and
translation information (often defined with various kinds of
projection rules).
Some of the difficulties in representing and applying this
knowledge include the following:

1. Translation rules (projection rules) for generating
correct meaning representations must be defined.
We have been able to define modular projection rules
that make use of the inheritance properties of KL-
ONE.
2. Since much of the knowledge for a particular
application is necessarily domain specific, it is
important to organize it in a way to ease extension of
the knowledge base and to ease moving to a new
domain.
3. Since distributional restrictions require specific
semantic features, pronouns and other semantically
neutral terms not necessarily having those features
must be accepted wherever they are consistent with
the expected type of noun phrase.
4. The inter-constituent relationships arising in relative
clauses must be consistent with all selection
restrictions and be represented in the resulting
meaning representation.

2. Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971994528301887">
The framework being developed uses a frame for each
semantically distinguishable type of phrase. Thus, a frame will be
required for each class of phrase having a unique combination of
- semantic distribution,
- selection restrictions on constituents making up the
phrase, and
.-_assignment of semantic relations to syntactic
function.
It is likely that the frames will refrect the natural categories of
descriptions of objects, events, actions, and states of affairs in
any particular application. For example, in the computer mail
domain, the following are some frames that have been useful:
- Clauses describing the sending of messages: SEND-
CLAUSE
- Clauses describing message arrival: ARRIVE.
CLAUSE
- Noun phrases describing messages: MESSAGE-NP
Noun phrases describing senders and recipients:
USER-NP
In the framework developed by Bobrow and Webber
[Bobrow&amp;Webber 80a, Bobrow&amp;Webber 804 for each frame,
each possible immediate constituent is associated by syntactic
function with a case or s/ot. The clause frames have slots
identified as head, subject,4: direct object, indirect object, etc.
Noun phrase frames have slots for the head, adjective modifiers,
article, etc. Each slot specifies the fillers that are semantically
acceptable, whether it is required or optional, and the number of
times it may be filled in a phrase. The constraints on fillers of
frames&apos; slots are stated in terms of other frames, e.g., the direct
object of a SEND-CLAUSE must be a MESSAGE-NP, or in terms
of word senses and categories of these senses. Some example
word sense categories are:
Message description nouns, such as &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;letter&amp;quot;: MESSAGE-NOUN
Information transmission verbs, such as &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;forward&amp;quot;: TRANSMISSION-VERB
In our domain the constraint on the subject of an ARRIVE-
CLAUSE is that it satisfies the MESSAGE-NP frame. A constraint
on the head of the MESSAGE-NP frame is that it is a word sense
in the category MESSAGE-NOUN.
Frames are represented as KL-ONE concepts. Case slots
appear as roles of concepts.6 Semantic constraints on what can
fill a case slot are encoded as the value restrictions of roles.
These value restrictions are concepts representing frames, word
senses, or word sense categories. Number restrictions on roles
show the number of times the syntactic function may be realized.
A required slot is marked by the number restriction on its role
having a minimum of 1; an optional slot has a number restriction
with a minimum of 0 and a maximum greater than 0. A phrase is
said to instantiate a given frame X if and only if its immediate
constituents satisfy the appropriate value and number restrictions
of all of X&apos;s roles.6 The collection of frames and word-sense
4Subject, object, etc. refer to logical roles rather than surface syntactic ones.

<footnote confidence="0.975014714285714">
5It is possible to associate roles with semantically defined subsets of other
roles, e.g., to assign separate roles to uses of color adjectives, size adjectives,
etc. This is an important convenience in constructing frames but not crucial to
our discussion.
6A recognition algorithm for this representation has been
presented P3obrow&amp;Webber 8Obj and several others have been developed since
then. These will be presented in separate reports.

since it encodes knowledge regarding semantic interpretation in

3. Translation Rules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957106382979">
To achieve the mapping from syntactic analysis to meaning
representation, translation rules are associated with individual
frames. Though the rules we give generate KL-ONE structures as
the meaning representation, other translation rules could be
developed for generating forms in a different target
representation language.
Any KL-ONE concept C representing a frame has an
associated concept C&apos; representing the main predicate of the
translation. For example, the translation of SEND-CLAUSE is the
concept Send-mail. Translations are stored in data attached to
the frame; we label this data TRANSLATION.
The translation rules themselves can be associated with
individual case slots. When inheritance results in more than one
translation rule for a case slot, the one originating from the most
specific frame in the hierarchy is selected.7
Suppose we are building the translation C&apos; of a matched
frame C. One common translation rule that could appear at a role
R of Cis (Paraphrase-as R&apos;). This establishes the translation of
the filler of R as the filler of R&apos; at concept C&apos;. For example, the
indirect object slot of SEND-CLAUSE has the rule &amp;quot;(Paraphrase-
as addressee)&amp;quot; to map the translation of the noun phrase in the
indirect object position into the addressee role of the Send-mail.
Another rule form, (Attach-SD sf), takes a semantic
function sf as an argument and attaches the translation of the
constituent filling R as the filler F of sf. A example of its use in the
processing of relative clauses as described in Section 6. Attach.
SD differs from Paraphrase-as by having facilities to establish a
role from F to C&apos;. This automatic feature is essentially the
opposite of Paraphrase-as, in that a semantic function runs from
the embedded constituent to its matrix phrase.
Another rule form is not a translation rule per se, but stores
data with the syntactic concept representing the syntactic
analysis of the phrase. The data could be checked by other
(conditional) translation rules.
Underlying these forms and available for more complex
types of translation is a general mechanism having the form
&amp;quot;source = =) goal.&amp;quot; The source identifies the structure that is to
be placed at the location identified by the goal. The formalism for
the source allows reference to arbitrary constants and concepts
and to a path through the concepts, roles, and attached data of a
KL-ONE network. The goal formalism also shows a path through
a network and may specify establishment of additional roles.
A separate test may be associated with a translation rule to
state conditions on the applicability of a rule. If the test is false,
the rule does not apply, and no translation corresponding to that
role is generated. The most common type of condition is
(Realized-Function? role), which is true if and only if some

immediate constituent fills that role in the analysis. It can be used
as an explicit statement that an optional role is translated only if
filled or as a way of stating that one constituent&apos;s translation
depends on the presence of another role. Additional conditions
are (EMPTY-ROLE?.role), which checks that role is not filled, and
(ROLE-FILLER? role class), which checks that the filler of role is
of type class. Since all three take a role name as argument, they
may be used to state cross-dependencies among roles.
Figure 3 contains some of the frames that allow for the
analysis .of our example. The treatment of the pronoun and
relative clause in the example sentence of Section 1 will be
explained in Sections 5 and 6.

4. Capturing Semantic Generalizations
via Abstract Case Frames
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999444878787879">
Verbs can be grouped with respect to the cases they
accept [Simmons 73, Celce-Murcia 76, Gawron 83); likewise,
groups exist for nouns. A KL-ONE syntaxonomy allows
straightforward statement of common properties, as well as
individually distinct properties of group members. Abstract case
frames are semantic generalizations applicable across a set of
the familiar sort of concrete frames. Properties common to the
generalization can be defined at the abstract frames and related
to the concrete frames through inheritance.
The use of time modification in &amp;quot;that arrived yesterday&amp;quot; is
the same as that of other verbs describing completion of an
activity, e.g., &amp;quot;come&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;reach&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot;. A general frame for
clauses with these verbs can show this role. The concrete frames
for clauses with verbs in this group are subconcepts and thereby
accept the time modifier (see Figure 4). The concrete frames can
restrict both the number and type of time modifiers, if necessary.
Translation rules associated with this time role can also be
restricted at the concrete frames.
Some modifiers dramatically affect the translation of entire
phrases, as in the partitive modifier &amp;quot;half of&amp;quot;. A description of
&amp;quot;half of&amp;quot; some individual entity (as opposed to a set of entities)
may not have the same distribution. For example, &amp;quot;Delete this
message from my directory.&amp;quot;, makes sense, but &amp;quot;Delete half of
this message from my directory.&amp;quot;, does not. This can be easily
stated through an abstract frame for the basic message
description specialized by two concrete frames(see Figure 5).
A related case is &amp;quot;toy X.&amp;quot; The translation of &amp;quot;toy X&amp;quot; is
certainly different from that of X, and their distributions may differ
as well. This may be handled in a way similar to the partitive
example.8 This class of examples points out the limits of case
frame systems. Other modifiers, such as &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot;, are
easily recognizable. However, more complex modifiers also make
the same distinctions, e.g., &amp;quot;The gun that was a fake was
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.514108818181818">
8An interesting alternative is to show the toy modifier as an optional role on an
abstract frame for object descriptions. Underneath it could be an abstract frame
distinguished only by requiring the toy modification &apos;role. All appropriate
inferences associated with descriptions of toys could be associated with this
concept. Frames for the basic descriptions of specific object types could be
placed underneath the object description frame. These could recognize &amp;quot;toy X&amp;quot;.
Our systems invoke the KL-ONE classifier after the recognition of each phrase
Pchmolze&amp;Lipkis 84 In this case, classification will result in identification of the
phrase as a kind of both X description and toy description allowing translation to
Show what is known about both without creating a &amp;quot;toy X&amp;quot; frame by hand. We
have not completely analyzed the affect of this strategy on the translation system.

Viewing our semantic interpretation system as a special purpose
infereoce system. it seems prudent to leave the recognition of the
type of these &amp;quot;guns&amp;quot; to more general-purpose reasoners.
Abstract case frames have significantly eased the
development and expansion of semantic coverage within our
application by helping us to focus on issues of generality and
specificity. The new frames we add have many slots established
by inheritance; consistency has been easier to maintain; and the
structure of the resulting syntaxonomy has helped in debugging.

5. Semantically Neutral Terms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971153592592593">
Case frames are an attempt to characterize semantically
coherent phrases. for instance, by selection restrictions. In
computational linguistics, selection restrictions have been
applied to the constituents that are possible fillers rather than to
what the constituents denote. For example, the restriction on the
direct object of a SEND-CLAUSE is MESSAGE-NP, rather than
messages. Problems with using such approximations in parsing
are discussed in [Ritchie 83].
For many natural language interfaces, a noun phrase&apos;s
internal structure gives enough information to determine whether
it satisfies a restriction.9 However, there are forms whose
semantic interpretation does not provide enough information to
guarantee the satisfaction of a constraint and yet need to be
allowed as fillers for slots. These include pronouns, some
elliptical forms, such as &amp;quot;the last three&amp;quot;, and other neutral noun
phrase forms, such as &amp;quot;the thing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the gift&amp;quot;. This also
includes some nonlexical gestural forms like the input from a
display that shows where the user pointed (literally or via a
mouse). We refer to all of these as semantically neutral terms. A
semantic interpretation system should accept such forms without
giving up restrictions on acceptable semantic categories.
However, these forms cannot, in general, appear everywhere. In
discussing computer mail, &amp;quot;I sent him&amp;quot; should be considered
nonsense.
Bobrow and Webber [Bobrow&amp;Webber 80b] propose a
general strategy for testing the compatibility of a constituent as a
slot filler based on non-incompatibility. The current system at
USC/ISI takes a conservative view of this proposal, developing
the idea for only neutral reference forms. All noun phrase types
displaying neutral reference are defined as instances of the
concept NeutralReference-NP. Furthermore, disjointnesS
relations are marked between the various subclasses of neutral
references and those classes of explicit descriptions which have
nonintersecting sets of potential references. During
interpretation, when such a NeutralReference-NP is proposed as
a slot filler, and that concept is not disjoint from the value
restriction on the slot, it is accepted.
In addition, since the slot restriction and the filler each have
meaning of their own, e.g., &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; describes a human male in the
computer mail domain, the translation should show the
contribution of both the neutral term and the constraint on the
slot. When the neutral form is qualified as a constituent by the
system, both the neutral form and the selection constraint are
ElClearly, misreference also interferes with this method (Goodman 83), as does
personification, metonymy and synecdoche. We propose other methods for these
last phenomena in [Weischedel 84, Weischedel 831.
remembered. When it is time to produce the translation, the
translation rule for the slot applies to a concept which is the
conjunction of the translations of the neutral reference form and
the restriction.
Part of the network that supports the translation of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; in
the example of section 1 is shown in Figure 6. Referring to
Figures 2 and 3, the effect of a reference to a male where a
reference to a computer. user was expected can be seen.

6. Inter-Constituent Relationships:
Relative Clauses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983629629629">
In relative clauses, the constraint on the slot filled by the
relative pronoun or the trace.&amp;quot;) must be satisfied by the noun
phrase that the relative clause modifies. In addition, the
translation of the noun phrase must reflect the contribution of the
use of the pronoun or trace in the relative clause. For example, in
&amp;quot;Send him the message that arrived yesterday&amp;quot;, the constraint on
the subject of &amp;quot;arrive&amp;quot; must be satisfied by the noun phrase of
which it is a part. Further, translation must result in co-reference
within the meaning representation of the value of the message
role of the Arrival-mail concept and the value of the message role
of the Send-mail concept (see Figure 2). This is a form of inter.
constituent relationship.
Our system processes relative clauses by treating the
relative pronouns and trace elements as neutral reference forms
(just as in the pronominal cases discussed in Section 5 and by
storing the constraints on the head of the relative clause until
they can be employed directly. In our example, the noun phrase
&amp;quot;that&amp;quot; is seen as a Trace-NP, a kind of NeutralReference-NP.
The structure assigned &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; is compatible with MESSAGE-NP
and hence acceptable. On translation, the Trace-NP is treated
like a neutral reference but the role and unchecked constraint are
recorded. as attached data on the instantiated case frame that
results from parsing the arrival clause. In the example, the facts
that a Trace-NP is in the subject role and that a Message-NP is
required are stored. That constraint is tested against the
classification of the matrix noun phrase when the clause is
proposed as a relative clause modifier.&amp;quot;

<footnote confidence="0.995314">
10The RUS parser which we employ supplies a &amp;quot;trace&amp;quot; to establish a syntactic
place holder with reduced relatives.
11lf the use of the relative pronoun or trace is inside a phrase inside the relative
clause, as in &amp;quot;the town from which I come&amp;quot;, the role and constraint will be passed
upward twice.

If that constraint is satisfied, the fact that the relative
pronoun and noun phrase co-refer is recorded. When the entire
noun phrase is processed successfully, the appropriate co-
references are established by performing (Attach-SD further-
constraint) and by retrieving the translation associated with the
role filled by the Trace-NP. This establishes co-reference
between the concept attached by the translation rule and the
translation of the entire noun phrase. In our example, the

Our technique uses properties of KL-ONE to build a
simplified, special-purpose inference engine for semantic
interpretation. The semantic processor is separate from both
syntactic and pragmatic processing, though it is designed to
maintain well-defined interaction with those components through
Woods&apos;s cascade model of natural language processing [Woods
80]. Uniform methods include logic grammars [Pereira
83, Palmer 83] and semantic grammars [Burton 77, Hendrix
78, Wilensky 80]. Logic grammars employ a Horn-clause theorem
prover for both syntactic and semantic processing. Semantic
grammars collapse syntactic and semantic analysis into an
essentially domain-specific grammar. Semantic interpretation is
handled through unification in some evolving systems, such as
PATTR-II [Robinson 83].
Several recent systems have separate semantic
interpretation components. Hirst [Hirst 83] uses a Montague-
inspired approach to produce statements in a frame language.
He uses individual mapping rules tied to the meaning-affecting
rules of a grammar. Boguraev [Boguraev 79] presents a semantic
interpreter based on patterns very similar to those of our case
frames. The meaning representation it produces is very similar to
the structure of our case frames.

<bodyText confidence="0.988674814814815">
We have presented approaches to typical difficulties in
building semantic interpreters. These have included a sketch of a
translation system that maps from the matched frames to KL-ONE
meaning representations. The idea of abstract case frames and
applications of them were introduced. Finally, ways of accepting
neutral references and allowing for the inter-constituent
constraints imposed by relative clauses were presented.
Our experience indicates that KL-ONE is effective as a
means of building and employing a library of case frames. The
basic approach is being used in research computer systems at
both USC/Information Sciences Institute and Bolt Beranek and
Newman, Inc.
Of course, many problems remain to be solved. Problems
currently under investigation include:
- Robust response to input that appears semantically
ill-formed, such as using an unknown word,
- A general treatment of quantification,
- Treatment of. conjunction,
- Feedback from the pragmatic component to guide
semantic interpretation,
- Generation of error messages (in English) based on
the case frames if the request seems beyond the
system&apos;s capabilities,
- Understanding classes of metonymy, such as &amp;quot;Send

<bodyText confidence="0.999963703703704">
KL-ONE offers a rigorous means of specifying terms
(concepts) and basic relationships among them, such as
subset/superset, disjointness, exhaustive cover, and relational
structure. Concepts are denoted graphically as ovals. Concepts
are Structured objects whose structure is indicated by named
relations (roles) between concepts. Roles are drawn as arcs
containing a circle and square. The concepts at the end of the
role arcs are said to be value restrictions. In addition, roles have
maximum and minimum restrictions on the number of concepts
that can be related by the role to the concept at the origin of the
arc. Concepts can also have data attached to them, stored as a
property list. Finally, the set of concepts is organized into an
inheritance hierarchy, through subc relations drawn with double-
line arrows from the subconcept to the superconcept.
All of the KL-ONE diagrams in the text are incomplete: for
instance, Figures 3 and 5 focus on different aspects of what is
one KL-ONE structure. In figure 3, the diagram for SEND.
CLAUSE specifies the concepts of &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; clauses. They have
exactly one head, which must be the lexical concept &amp;quot;send.&amp;quot;
They must have a direct object which is a MESSAGE-NP, and
they optionally have an indirect object which is a USER-NP.
Figure 5 shows that SEND-CLAUSE&apos;s are MESSAGE-
TRANSMISSION-CLAUSE&apos;s, which are a type of CLAUSE.
The meaning representation, Figure 2, generated for &amp;quot;Send
him the message that arrived yesterday&amp;quot; consists of the concept
Send-mail, having an addressee which is a Computer-User and a
message which is ComputerMail.

<abstract confidence="0.9781184">semantic interpretation relates a &apos; phrase&apos;s analysis based on syntactic criteria to one based on semantic criteria. This paper presents extensions to the work of Bobrow and Webber [Bobrow&amp;Webber 80a, Bobrow&amp;Webber 80b] on interpretation using KL-ONE to represent knowledge. Clause The approach is based on an extended case frame formalism Head: Sand applicable to all types of phrases, not just clauses. The frames used to recognize semantically acceptable phrases, identify Object: Noun Phrase their structure, and, relate them to their meaning representation Head: Him through translation rules. Approaches are presented for KL-ONE structures as the meaning of a sentence, for Object: Noun Phrase semantic generalizations through abstract case frames, Message and for handling pronouns and relative clauses.</abstract>
