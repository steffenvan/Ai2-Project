<bodyText confidence="0.999915863636364">
With the spread of large quantities of corpus
data, the need has arisen to develop some stan-
dard not only for the format of interchange of
text (an issue which has already been taken
up by the Text Encoding Inititiave), but also
for any information added in some subsequent
stage of (linguistic) enrichment. The research
community has much to gain by such stan-
dardization since it will enable researchers to
effectively access and therefore make optimal
use of the results of previous work on a corpus.
This paper provides some direction of thought
as to the development of a standardized tagset.
We focus on a minimal tagset, i.e. a tagset con-
taining information about wordclasses. We in-
vestigate what criteria should be met by such
a tagset. On the basis of an investigation and
comparison of ten different tagseirs that have
been used over the years for the (wordclass)
tagging of corpora, we arrive at a proposal for
a cross-linguistic minimal tagset for Germanic
languages&apos;.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997495">
The last few years there has been an increasing
interest in the use of corpus data, especially by
those working in the field of natural language
processing (NLP). This development can in
part be ascribed to the fact that the scale on
which such data are becoming available has
increased: as publishing houses, industry, etc.

terchange of texts this meant a dramatic in-
crease in the amount of text that was readily
available to anyone interested, while develop-
ments in hardware and in software have made
it possible to manipulate large quantities of
data (more) effectively.
Earlier corpus-based approaches proved to
be laborious undertakings. Before the &apos;real&apos;
work could begin one would have to go through
the painstaking process of designing a cor-
pus, gaining permission from publishers to use
(part(s) of) texts and somehow making the
texts computer-readable. The size of the cor-
pora was very much determined by such fac-
tors as cost (in terms of time and money to
be invested) and availability of data. Corpora
generally were compiled for particular research
purposes, such as the investigation of a partic-
ular variety of the language. Typical examples
here are the Brown Corpus and the Lancaster-
Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus which were both
compiled with the intention of representing a
cross-section of the language (American En-
glish and British English respectively). Com-
pilers of corpora would each adopt his/her
own conventions for representing the textual
data. In a similar fashion the further process-
ing of the data, the enrichment of (basically)
raw text with some kind of linguistic informa-
tion (wordclass information, syntactic, seman-
tic and/or even pragmatic information) would
largely depend on the time and money avail-
able, and also on the particular interests of the
researchers involved.
Recently, with the increase in the amount
of data that are becoming available, the at-
tention of corpus compilers has been drawn to
the need for a common interchange format for
texts in order to make these data more readily

accessible for third parties. The Text Encoding
Inititiative (TEI) has undertaken to develop a
standard for the marking up of texts that is
based on the Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML). So far we have not yet
reached the point where any serious attempts
are being made to standardize the linguistic
information that is being added in successive
stages of linguistic enrichment. Instead, re-
searchers from different backgrounds and with
different beliefs are working their own turf ex-
ploring a variety of methods for the enrich-
ment of corpora, ranging from purely stochas-
tic to strictly rule-based approaches, which
seem to be in competition with each other. In
view of the current state of the art in corpus
analysis, the amount of work that has already
been done in the area of tagging corpora for
wordclass information and the experience that
has been gained in the process, it would appear
that by now the time has come to start think-
ing about developing some sort of standard for
the encoding of wordclass information.
In the remainder of this paper we focus
on the design of a minimal tagset, i.e. a
tagset containing information about word.
classes, that will provide a common basis for
the wordclass tagging of texts written in Ger-
manic languages.
We first compare a number of tagsets that
have been or are being used for the tagging of
wordclass information in prominent corpora.
On the basis of this comparison we arrive at a
number of criteria that a standardized (mini-
mal) tagset should meet. Finally put forward a
proposal for a basic tagset that may be applied
cross-linguistically.

Tagsets: a comparison
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994806870967742">
In order to give the reader some idea of
the kind of (wordclass) information covered
in various tagsets, a comparison is made of
the tagsets employed in ten corpora2 the
Brown Corpus (Kuaera and Francis, 1967), the
Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus (Johansson et
al., 1978), the SUSANNE Corpus (Sampson,
2. Information regarding a detailed characterization
of the corpora including size, design, research context
and method of processing can be found in the corre-
sponding literature
forthcoming), the Penn Treebank (Santorini,
1991), the IBM-Lancaster Corpus (Black et
al., 1993), the British National Corpus (Leech,
1993), the ICE Corpus (Greenbaum, 1991),
the Tosca Corpus (Oostdijk, 1991), the Dutch
Eindhoven Corpus (uit den Boogaart, 1975),
and the German IDS-Mannheim Corpus (Neu-
mann, 1987).
As a first step in making a comparison of
the ten tagsets employed in the wordclass tag-
ging of the above corpora we start by distin-
guishing the wordclass categories that these
tagsets have in common. There are nine cate-
gories that are (in one fashion or another) in-
cluded in each of the tagsets: noun, pronoun,
article/determiner, adjective, adverb, preposi-
tion, conjunction, verbal form, and interjec-
tion. Apart from these nine categories we dis-
tinguish one other category, which by defini-
tion is open-ended since it is intended to cover
all tags that do not fit into any of the other
categories. We shall refer to this category as
&amp;quot;open category&amp;quot;. Next, we make an inventory
of the different tags employed by each of the
tagsets. As a result we obtain lists3 of tags
for each of the wordclass categories we distin-
guished. For example, Table 1 lists the various
tags as they occur in the ten tagsets under
consideration for the tagging of conjunctions
(incl. connectives).
There appears to be a great deal of overlap:
while actual tags may differ (cf. CO, CI, 70 for
conjunctions in general, in the ICE, Brown and
Eindhoven tagsets respectively), there seems
to be some consensus as to the kind of infor-
mation one wants to encode or tag. Before go-
ing into this, however, we take a closer look at
both the format and the nature of the tags.
Starting with the oldest tagset included in
our comparison, the Brown tagset, we see that
this is in a sense a very &apos;flat&apos; coding scheme. It
was developed with the intention of encoding
general wordclass information. The tags con-
sist of character sequences which encode the
wordclass category of a word and occasionally
extended information such as form, aspect or
case. Thus for example we find .73 for adjective
and CC for coordinating conjunction, but also
VB for base form of verb, VBD for past tense
of verb, VBG for present participle, etc.

of Penn Treebank, IBM-Lancaster and the
British National Corpus very much follow
the Brown tagset. Of these tagsets, the LOB
tagset is of course closest to the Brown tagset,
since the corpus was compiled with the inten-
tion of comparing American and British En-
glish from the same year (1961).
The Penn Treebank tagset appears to be
a reduced version of the Brown/LOB tagset.
The reduction becomes manifest in that some
tags are less detailed. For example, where
Brown/LOB distinguish between possessive
pronoun, personal pronoun, and reflexive pro-
noun and with each of these has a further
subclassification (e.g. PPlA for personal pro-
noun, first person singular nominative; PP1AS
for personal pronoun, first person plural nom-
inative; PP10 for personal pronoun, first per-
son singular accusative; etc.), Penn Treebank
only has one tag, PP, to cover all personal,
possessive, and reflexive pronouns. All in all
the derivation of the Penn Treebank from the
Brown/LOB tagset is fairly straightforward. A
minor deviation occurs in the tagging of gen-
itive markers in the case of nouns. Here ac-
cording to the Penn Treebank tagging scheme
genitive markers are assigned their own tag,
which is not the case with the Brown/LOB
tagging scheme.

emerged from the cooperation between IBM
and the Lancaster-based Unit for Computer

Research on the English Language4 all can
be placed within what might be referred to
as the Brown/LOB tradition in tagging. For
our discussion we single out one particular
tagging scheme, called CLAWS2a. This tag-
ging scheme was developed to encode the in-
formation needed at wordclass level in order to
be able to parse computer manuals. Although
this tagging scheme clearly shows some re-
semblance to the Brown/LOB tagging scheme,
it stands out in that with certain categories
(such as verb and noun) there is a lot of extra
detail that we do not find elsewhere. For ex-
ample, tags such as noun of style and noun of
organization are unique for this tagset. When
we look at the format of the tags we find that
there may be up to five characters per tag,
while the leftmost characters relate the more
general wordclass information and the charac-
ters that occur towards the right specify fur-
ther detail. Compound lexical items can be en-
coded by means of tags that extend over more
than one word. For example, while II would
be the tag for simple preposition, the complex
preposition in spite of is tagged 1131 1132 1133.
The tagset that has been developed within
the framework of the British National Corpus
(BNC) contains only some 60 different tags5
The reason for this must be sought in the
fact that the BNC intends to incorporate a
very large amount of text (approx. 100 mil-
lion words). The grammatical (i.e. wordclass)
tagging of the corpus is to be carried out au-
tomatically. For reasons of efficiency and also
to increase the success rate of the tagging it
was decided to have a rather small tagset. A
comparison of the BNC tagging scheme to the
one used in the IBM-Lancaster Corpus shows
that the two tagging schemes are closely re-
lated. Both can be characterized as &apos;flat&apos; tag-
ging schemes. The major difference between
the two, apart from their sizes, appears to be
that the BNC uses more mnemonic abbrevia-
tions for otherwise similar tags6 ; for example
general adjectives get the label AJO instead of
JJ.

6. This was probably done in the hope to improve the
readibility of the various tags. For example, the tag 33
for adjective is replaced by the tag AJO for general
adjective.
So far we have been looking at the tagging
schemes employed by five English language
corpora. Turning away from those for a mo-
ment and shifting our attention to the German
and the Dutch corpora, we see that the tagging
schemes employed in these corpora do not dif-
fer all that much from what we have already
seen with the English corpora. Again &apos;flat&apos; tag-
ging schemes are found, while the wordclass
categories that are distinguished largely coin-
cide with the English wordclasses. As with the
tagging schemes for the English language cor-
pora, the tagging schemes for the German and
Dutch corpora each have their own degree of
detail.
The 12-million-word Mannheim Corpus was
tagged automatically for both wordclass infor-
mation and syntactic information by means of
the SATAN parser7. Neither level of analysis
includes much detail. The wordclass tagging
is rather rudimentary and includes only the
most basic wordclass information needed for
the syntactic analysis. Only occasionally in-
formation is added about prepositions that oc-
cur as collocates of other words and about the
case that prepositions require for their com-
plements.
The tagging of the relatively small Eind-
hoven Corpus is rather detailed. The tags con-
sist of three digit codes, where the first digit in-
dicates the wordclass, the second digit supplies
information on the subclass, and the third
digit carries additional information of various
kinds, such as verb aspect, person, number,
etc.
Returning now to the tagging schemes em-
ployed for the tagging of English language cor-
pora, we find that in the case of the three
remaining tagging schemes under considera-
tion — the SUSANNE tagging scheme, the
ICE tagset, and the Tosca tagset — they have
opted for more hierarchically structured tag-
ging schemes. Each of these tagging schemes
encodes highly detailed wordclass information
in a systematic fashion by introducing some
sort of &apos;additional feature(s)&apos; slots in their
tags. The SUSANNE tagging scheme distin-
guishes as many as 352 distinct tags. Closer
examination of these tags however learns us

that at the basis of these 352 items there are
some 70 major wordclasses, while the addition
of more featurelike information such as num-
ber, person, case, etc. leads to a total of 352
tags. Something similar appears to be the case
when we consider the Tosca tagset and its less
detailed derivative, the ICE tagset. Again tags
for major wordclass categories have been ex-
tended so as to include additional feature in-
formation.
In summary, having compared the different
tagging schemes that have been or are being
employed in the tagging of wordclass informa-
tion in ten different corpora, we find that

much from one language to another, in
other words it appears feasible to have
a tagset that could be applied cross-
linguistically.
As to the last point, we must observe that the
idea of having a tagset that can be applied
cross-linguistically is not at all new. For exam-
ple, the tagset employed in the multi-lingual
ESPRIT-860 project [Kesselheim, 1986] was
intended to comprise all the tags that would
be required for the tagging of wordclass infor-
mation in each of the EC languages. Since this
meant that not only Germanic languages were
included (Dutch, English, German), but also
Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish)
and Greek, the tagset could be expected to be
truly cross-linguistic. Unfortunately, however,
examination of the tagset shows that it is more
of a collection of various tags that any of the
languages might at some stage require, rather
than a thoroughly designed minimal interlin-
gual (or cross-linguistic) tagset. It is therefore
all the more surprising to find that certain
wordclasses in German, Dutch and English are
not accounted for&apos;.

Part III
Criteria for a minimal
tagset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998194">
Having compared the tagsets of ten prominent
corpora we now arrive at a point where we
should reflect a little on the criteria that will
have to apply to a tagset to make it cross-
linguistic and generally applicable. If we take
a closer look at the results of our study de-
scribed above we can conclude that there are
mainly three types of criteria in relation to the
development of a tagset; criteria of a linguis-
tic nature, criteria for the data format of the
labels and terminological criteria for the label
names. Therefore the following points deserve
special attention:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99949325">
• coverage of major word classes
• addition of relevant feature information
• format of the tags
• representation of the labels
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9891583125">
Let us begin with the linguistic criteria. The
major word classes should minimally be cov-
ered by the tagset. During our projection of
the different tagsets we came to the conclu-
sion that there are 12 main word classes&apos; that
can be distinguished. As we said earlier, it be-
came obvious that across the different tagsets
variation as far as the main classes are con-
cerned was not very large. The same was true
even for the two non-English tagsets.
The specification of feature information, how-
ever, turned out to be snore problematic than
the determination of word classes, because the
tagsets differed strongly in their degree of de-
tail and/or their research context. From a lin-
guistic point of view, there is a greet variety
of feature information. First of all, there are
subclassifications of the major word classes,
such as the distinction between common and
proper nouns or the different types of pro-
noun. Furthermore, in relation to verbs, we
can think of additional feature information
about the degree of subcategorisation (tran-
sitivity). Although this appeared not to be a
very common feature in the tagsets examined,
it can be of great importance to grammar-
based syntactic corpus analysis&apos;&apos;&apos;. Another rel-
evant linguistic criterion is to facilitate the in-
clusion of morphological information, at least
8. For example, there appears to be no wordclass tag
for interjections for German and Dutch,. nor is there a 9. see following section

</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997462">

<bodyText confidence="0.999969740740741">
for verbs, nouns and adjectives. Features con-
taining this information are for example: num-
ber (singular, plural), person (first, second,
third), gender (masculine, feminine, neuter),
degree of comparison (positive, comparative,
superlative) and, especially for the analysis of
German texts, case information (nominative,
genitive, dative, accustive). From the tagsets
under survey it appeared that morphological
information is desirable, but there seems to
be no agreement on what sort of information
should be added. This leads us to a following
criterion that is important for the development
of our tagset: the format of the tags.
From our study it has become clear that
there is some degree of agreement on major
word class information and to some extent also
on their subclassification. However, with re-
spect to additional feature information we can
see a sort of growing disagreement as the de-
tail of specification increases. This has to do
with the various purposes people may have in
relation to the enrichment of corpora. On the
other hand language-specific items play a role
in this context too, for example prepositions
in postposition in Dutchil. So the formai of
the tags has to account for two major aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994316">
• hierarchical structuring of information
• flexibility in relation to the encoding of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990855322580645">
special features and/or language specific
items
Hierarchical structuring implies the ordering
of information within a specific label. From left
to right the degree of detail will increase, so
that at the beginning we will find the major
word class label, followed by a subclassifica-
tion, and then several additional features.
With flexibility we mean that the label format
should be open so that no researcher is lim-
ited by our tagset in adding special features
that, according to his opinion and/or research
aims, are useful or even essential. On the other
hand researchers who want to make use of ba-
sic word classes only, need only concern them-
selves with parts of the tags and can ignore
the other parts.
In our attempt to develop a cross-linguistic
tagset we make use of a hierarchical data-field
oriented coding scheme. The hierarchy in the
labels is represented as follows: the level of de-
tail increases from left to right and the dif-
ferent. entries are separated by one or more
ri.Hiiloopt het bos in. (engl.: He runs into the forest.)
unique delimiters. This way of coding also
enables researchers to convert the format of
the labels in a relatively easy way for their
individual needs. For example in the ICE-
project, where the tags form the input of a
two-level grammar, labels with the format de-
scribed above can be automatically converted
into two-level tags. So this way of coding seems
to be attractive linguistically (levels of descrip-
tion) as well as formally (interchangeability).
Finally we have to determine how the la-
bels should be represented. Generally we can
distinguish between two ways of coding - ei-
ther a completely numeric label or a mnemonic
letter-digit sequence. Although for reasons of
readability mnemonic labels are preferable,
numeric labels can be used as well, since it is
not too difficult to transform one well-defined
form into another. The advantage of numeric
labels is that they are relatively compact and
therefore can be stored more efficiently.
Focussing on the mnemonic way of coding,
the question is: what terminology can best be
used for the labels. From the tagsets exam-
ined we can conclude that there is a commonly
accepted linguistic terminology with respect
to word-class information, also from a cross-
linguistic point of view. In order to provide
codes as mnemonic as possible we are of the
opinion that this terminology should also be
included in our tagset.
In the following section we present a first
step towards a cross-linguistic tagset as a re-
sult of our comparative study and illustrate
the different major word classes, their possi-
ble subclassification, additional feature infor-
mation as well as the way in which this infor-
mation can be coded.

In this section we present a basic cross-
linguistic tagset for Germanic languages.
Those familiar with the coding scheme
adopted in the ESPRIT-860 project will find a
number of similarities with this scheme. Thus,
as we mentioned above, we have adopted the
idea of a hierarchical data-field oriented coding
scheme. Moreover the scheme allows for over-

as well as underspecification12. Unlike the ES-
PRIT tagging scheme, however, it is strictly
datafield oriented in order to allow automatic
format and addition of extra feature informa-
tion. The different datafields are always sepa-
rated by a # symbol, which functions as a de-
limiter. The hierarchical structure of the tags
becomes clear when one looks at the examples
we give in order to illustrate the tagging of the
different wordclasses. In addition to what has
been described above, the tagset also includes
so-called ditto-tags which make it possible to
account for lexical items that consist of more
than one word, such as compound nouns or
complex prepositions. Ditto-tags take the form
of two numbers separated by a slash, where
the first number indicates the current part of
a compound item, while the second number in-
dicates the total number of words that make
up the compound. For example, the three word
complex preposition in spite of is tagged as fol-
lows:
in PRP#..41/3, spite PRP#...#2/31 of
PRP#..43/3.
Our basic tagset for the encoding of word class
information in corpora comprises twelve ma-
jor word class categories and an additional
category which is intended to accommodate
language-specific items. The twelve major cat-
egories that are distinguished are listed in Ta-
ble 2.
The additional category we shall refer to as
open. Each of the word class categories is dis-
cussed below.
Perhaps the categories particle, interjection
and formulaic expression are not so familiar to
some readers. For this reason we give a more
detailed description when presenting them.

Interjections are normally referred to as
words that do not enter into syntactic
relations and that do not have a clear
morphological structure. Very often they
are of a onomatopoeic nature. Examples
of interjections are: aha, Am, wow, past,
oops.
Formulaic Expressions are fixed expres-
sions used as formulaic reactions in a cer-
tain dialogue contexts. Examples are: all
the best; excuse me; dank u wel; Danke,
gut
Particles are morpholog-
ically fixed words that do not belong to
any of the word classes described above
and that can function in many ways in
a sentence, for example as introducing
element of the subject of an infinitival
clause (for example: I am waiting for the
meeting to begin), or they function as
fixed answers to questions (for example:

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985381095238095">
In this paper we have sketched the way in
which linguistic enrichment of corpora could
be standardized. We have reported on our ef-
forts to standardize the word class tags. In ad-
dition, we compared the tag sets of a number
of prominent corpora. The differences between
these sets encouraged us to proceed towards a
standardized cross-linguistic tagset. This set
could contribute to improved access and ex-
change of analyzed corpora. In addition to a
standardized tagset it might be interesting to
determine if and how a standard annotation
of linguistic information on higher levels of de-
scription (syntax, semantics, pragmatics) can
be established.
We are working on these issues and we hope
to encourage other (academic and industrial)
researchers in the field of corpus linguistics to
participate in the discussion about common
guidelines for the linguistic annotation of cor-
pora in the future.

<abstract confidence="0.993536043478261">With the spread of large quantities of corpus data, the need has arisen to develop some standard not only for the format of interchange of text (an issue which has already been taken up by the Text Encoding Inititiave), but also for any information added in some subsequent stage of (linguistic) enrichment. The research community has much to gain by such standardization since it will enable researchers to effectively access and therefore make optimal use of the results of previous work on a corpus. This paper provides some direction of thought as to the development of a standardized tagset. We focus on a minimal tagset, i.e. a tagset containing information about wordclasses. We investigate what criteria should be met by such a tagset. On the basis of an investigation and comparison of ten different tagseirs that have been used over the years for the (wordclass) tagging of corpora, we arrive at a proposal for a cross-linguistic minimal tagset for Germanic languages&apos;.</abstract>

As to the last point, we must observe that the idea of having a tagset that can be applied cross-linguistically is not at all new. For example, the tagset employed in the multi-lingual ESPRIT-860 project [Kesselheim, 1986] was intended to comprise all the tags that would be required for the tagging of wordclass information in each of the EC languages. Since this meant that not only Germanic languages were included (Dutch, English, German), but also Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish) and Greek, the tagset could be expected to be truly cross-linguistic. Unfortunately, however, examination of the tagset shows that it is more of a collection of various tags that any of the languages might at some stage require, rather than a thoroughly designed minimal interlingual (or cross-linguistic) tagset.

As a first step in making a comparison of the ten tagsets employed in the wordclass tagging of the above corpora we start by distinguishing the wordclass categories that these tagsets have in common. There are nine categories that are (in one fashion or another) included in each of the tagsets: noun, pronoun, article/determiner, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, verbal form, and interjection. Apart from these nine categories we distinguish one other category, which by definitio</context>
