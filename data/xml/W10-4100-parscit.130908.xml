Preface

<bodyText confidence="0.96927256">
With the rapid of expansion of Chinese language materials on the Internet, the use of natural language
technology as a way of harnessing Chinese language content is drawing growing interest from
researchers around the globe. The rise of China as a global power with increasing influence on the
world stage is only fanning this interest. The Chinese language also has a number of characteristics
that make Chinese language processing particularly challenging and intellectually rewarding. To meet
the challenge, the first CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing (CLP2010) is
organized under the auspices of CIPS (Chinese Information Processing Society of China) and SIGHAN,
a Special Interest Group of the ACL.
The goal of CLP2010 is to bring together both established and aspiring researchers around the globe and
provide a unified forum for them to showcase their research achievements, share their ideas, and frame
research problems that are crucial in advancing the state-of-the-art in Chinese language processing.
There have been four successful international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs sponsored by
SIGHAN that have greatly advanced the state-of-the-art in this area. This year, in addition to the
Chinese word segmentation task, the conference will include tasks in Chinese parsing, Chinese personal
name disambiguation and Chinese word sense induction, hence attracting wider participation.
The proceedings includes 5 invited papers from senior researchers and 20 regular papers carefully
reviewed and selected out of 31 submissions from different areas of Chinese language processing. The
four bakeoff tasks have attracted more than 68 groups to submit their results. The proceedings also
includes 4 overview papers that introduce the bakeoff tasks as well as the 44 bakeoff papers.
Last but not least, we would like to thank professors Chu-Ren Huang, Dan Jurafsky, Youqi Cao, and
Chenqing Zong for initiating and proposing to hold this conference. We are also deeply indebted to the
reviewers for their tireless and generous work.
We wish you all an enjoyable and thought-provoking conference.

<abstract confidence="0.978725615384615">cips@iscas.ac.cn ii Preface With the rapid of expansion of Chinese language materials on the Internet, the use of natural language technology as a way of harnessing Chinese language content is drawing growing interest from researchers around the globe. The rise of China as a global power with increasing influence on the world stage is only fanning this interest. The Chinese language also has a number of characteristics that make Chinese language processing particularly challenging and intellectually rewarding. To meet the challenge, the first CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing (CLP2010) is organized under the auspices of CIPS (Chinese Information Processing Society of China) and SIGHAN, a Special Interest Group of the ACL. The goal of CLP2010 is to bring together both established and aspiring researchers around the globe and provide a unified forum for them to showcase their research achievements, share their ideas, and frame research problems that are crucial in advancing the state-of-the-art in Chinese language processing. There have been four successful international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs sponsored by SIGHAN that have greatly advanced the state-of-the-art in this area. This year, in addition to the Chinese word segmentation task, the conference will include tasks in Chinese parsing, Chinese personal name disambiguation and Chinese word sense induction, hence attracting wider participation. The proceedings includes 5 invited papers from senior researchers and 20 regular papers carefully reviewed and selected out of 31 submissions from different areas of Chinese language processing. The four bakeoff tasks have attracted more than 68 groups to submit their results. The proceedings also includes 4 overview papers that introduce the bakeoff tasks as well as the 44 bakeoff papers. Last but not least, we would like to thank professors Chu-Ren Huang, Dan Jurafsky, Youqi Cao, and Chenqing Zong for initiating and proposing to hold this conference. We are also deeply indebted to the reviewers for their tireless and generous work. We wish you all an enjoyable and thought-provoking conference.</abstract>
