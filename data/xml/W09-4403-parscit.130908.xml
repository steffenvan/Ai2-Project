Enriching linguistic resources with domain information has
been considered one important target in natural language
applications. However, automatic definition extraction of
this domain information from specialized resources has
revealed certain methodological problems in definition
construction. This paper presents some problems
encountered in automatic definition extraction that are
mainly related to inconsistencies in definitions, different
granularity of definitions and embedded definitions. To
face these problems some Meaning-Text Theory tools have
been used: (a) semantic labels as a solution for inferring
knowledge, (b) lexical functions as a way of providing
coherence to definitions and (c) the actancial structure as a
tool for developing consistent and complete definitions.
Our goal is to describe the problems and to show the
solutions proposed.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957048780488">
Reusing and enriching existing resources are nowadays two
key issues both in academy and in the business world. In
several scientific disciplines such as ontology development,
computational linguistics, web semantic, ontologies and
computational terminology the interest has been focused on
many different aspects ranging from reusing lexicons,
thesauri to create ontologies to extracting semantic
relations from domain corpora or enriching definitions
from specialized texts. One of the current drifts tends to
build ontologies extracting definitions from different
sources. However, building new resources with linguistic
information extracted from different domain sources has
revealed a difficult task as quite often the domain sources
can be useful for a certain task but may show certain
inconsistencies for others. In this paper, we present the
problems encountered when trying to reuse three domain
resources for two different purposes: (a) to build an
ontology and (b) to populate a general linguistic resource, a
database, with specific information from domain
documents. With the aim of developing a consistent
linguistic resource for further use in natural language
applications, we focus on achieving consistent definitions
of domain terms. Accordingly, we resort to the Meaning-
Text Theory (MTT) principles [16] to propose some
systematic solutions in order to avoid the inconsistency
problems when building a terminological resource that can
later be used in ontology development. Thus, we have
mainly focused on three fundamental aspects: (a) semantic
labels as a solution for inferring knowledge, (b) lexical
functions as a way of providing coherence to definitions
and (c) the actancial structure as a tool for developing
consistent and complete definitions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section
2 we provide the scenario in which we have based our
research and the tools used. Section 3 focuses on definition
extraction and the pitfalls faced in the process. Section 4
presents a short review on definition typology. The MTT
tools used and the database, BADELE 3000, are described
in section 5. The problems encountered and the solutions
proposed are presented in section 6. Finally, some
conclusions are outlined in section 7.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966071428571">
The domain resources used in this project summarized in
this section (for more details, see Gómez-Pérez et al [7])
relate to geographic and geospatial information. All
geographic information (GI) resources contain data about
real entities and how to represent them in a map. So, each
entity corresponds to an instance of a geographic
phenomenon (feature). Indeed, the most important concept
for GI is the feature since the Open GeoSpatial Consortium
(OGC) [19] has declared that a geographic feature is the
starting point for modelling geospatial information. In other
words, a feature, which is the basic unit of GI, is an
abstraction of a real world phenomenon associated with a
location relative to the Earth, about which data are
collected, maintained and disseminated [11]. Features can

include representations of a wide range of phenomena that
can be located in time and space such as buildings, towns
and villages or a geometric network, a geo-referenced
image, pixel or thematic layer.
For modelling this domain we have decided to use an
ontology. To achieve this target, we have used three
domain resources provided by the National Geographic
Institute of Spain (IGN-E): the Concise Gazetteer (NC) -
scale 1:1,000,000-, the Numerical Cartographic Database
(BCN25) -scale 1:25,000-, and the National Topographic
Database (BTN25) -scale 1:25,000-.
The Concise Gazetteer is a basic corpus of
standardized toponyms created by the Spanish
Geographical Names Commission. The first version has
3667 toponyms. This gazetteer complies with the United
Nations Conference Recommendations on Geographic
Names Normalization. The Concise Gazetteer has been
created by the Spanish Geographical Names Commission.
For further details, refer to Nomenclátor Geográfico
Conciso de España [18].
The BCN25 presents an abstraction of reality,
represented in one or more sets of geographic data, as a
defined classification of phenomena. It defines the feature
type, its operations, attributes, and associations represented
in geographic data. For more information on this document
see Rodriguez [21].
The BTN25 is the latest IGN-E catalogue and intends
to be a sort of BCN25 reorganization, following a structure
similar to frames. The instance information is the same as
in BCN25, but the phenomena classification and its
attributes are completely different.
These resources have one characteristic in common:
each resource has a domain dictionary with phenomena. In
the first case, NC phenomena, there is a txt file with 22
definitions. In the second case, BCN25 phenomena, an
Excel file contains 366 definitions developed after the
catalogue. Finally, there is a PDF document with “Capture
rules for GI to be included in BTN25” (a first version),
which describes its phenomena with 292 definitions (the
document is not complete). In all cases, definitions were
formulated by specialists on geography to facilitate the
classification of the real entities in order to be included in
the instance set of each resource.
All definitions are grouped by labels, as illustrated in
Table 1 with four examples. These definitions have been
used to build the ontology, as explained in section 3.

3. Definition extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921755">
Definition extraction, as used in this paper, is the process of
extracting the definition for a term from different resources.
In our case these definitions have not been taken from
corpora using machine learning techniques, as in many
natural language processing applications [3], but from other
domain resources with explicit definitions for these terms,
their term variants or other semantically equivalent terms.
However, some problems have appeared in this definition
extraction process that showed certain inconsistencies and
loss of information.
The definition extraction process followed to build and
enrich a domain ontology is as follows: (1) the application
we have developed retrieves the term from “Capture rules
for GI to be included in BTN25”; (2) it extracts its
definition from the same document; (3) it searches for the
term in the auxiliary domain dictionaries; and (4) it extracts
the corresponding definitions to add them to the
corresponding classes. All these actions are executed
automatically. Fig. 1 shows the overall workflow of
information.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.81188">
Fig. 1. Ontology building with definition extraction
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984595">
As a result of this process, we obtained an ontology
(called PhenomenOntology 3.5) which included 108 terms
extracted from the documents mentioned and later
transformed in 108 classes belonging to three groups: (a)
classes without definitions; (b) classes with one definition;
(c) classes with more than one definition. However, the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987316">
15
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964729166666">
retrieval ratio of definitions extracted from the auxiliary
dictionaries was very low, although they belonged to the
same domain. In fact, only 4 definitions were found in the
NC dictionary (although it contains 22 definitions, which
means that 18 definitions were lost in the process) and 33
definitions were found in the BCN25 dictionary (it contains
366 definitions, which means that 333 definitions were also
lost in the definition retrieval process).
The origin of this low ratio mainly lies on the
abundance of terminological variants and semantically
equivalent terms. For example, when trying to retrieve
definitions for ‘río’ (river) in the ontology, the system
cannot recognize definitions of term variants such as ‘río 1ª
categoría’ (river 1st category) and ‘río 2ª categoría’ (river
2nd category), and consequently it does not retrieve any of
these definitions. Moreover, semantically equivalent terms
are not retrieved when incorporating definitions in the
ontology, as the system cannot recognize the similarity of
the definitions of ‘río’ (river) and ‘corriente fluvial’
(flowing current).
Therefore, the problem is not only the loss of certain
definitions in the extraction process but also the
overlapping of some of them with different granularity
which led to inconsistencies. For example, ‘río’ (river) was
retrieved with two definitions: recorrido de una corriente
de agua natural y de caudal más o menos constante, que
recoge los aportes de una cuenca fluvial (taken from the
original document BTN25: “stream of natural water, with
more or less constant flow, which collects water from other
water courses”) and curso natural de agua (taken from the
NC dictionary: “waterstream”).
Although these terminographic resources have been
originally compiled by different experts, they show many
lexico-semantic divergences that hinder the automatic
definition extraction process. Quite often specific domain
lexicographic resources are generally built to share
information within a project team and attention is not
usually paid to terminological principles when defining
new terminology.
In other words, when building ontologies, automatic
extraction of classes implies the annotation of these classes
with definitions which are also automatically extracted. The
final result of the definition extraction process reveals some
problems that we have tried to tackle as explained in the
next sections. Nevertheless, ontology building problems are
out of the scope of this paper, though they have served as
test bed for our research on principles for definition
writing.

4. Definition typology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982389237288136">
According to the traditional aristotelic genus-species
definition, a definition should describe the concept and its
relations to other concepts in the concept system. This type
of definition is traditionally called formal definition, or
intensional definition [8, 9]. That is to say, it reflects the
superordinate concept to which the designation belongs and
its delimiting characteristics. However, there are also other
ways of designating concepts, extensional, ostensive,
lexical, precising, and stipulative definitions [8] as well as
ontological definitions [4]. For a more exhaustive revision
on definitions see [13, 12]. Although these definitions can
be useful for certain purposes depending on the user’s
needs and the approach adopted, they do not conform to a
certain defining formulation and hinder any possibilities of
formalizing the knowledge expressed in definitions in order
to be used for natural language applications, such as
knowledge extraction, ontology enrichment, to mention just
a few. For this reason, we claim that some
recommendations regarding terminological definitions
should be considered when preparing domain resources. As
[9, 10] stipulates the selection of an appropriate
superordinate is crucial for the intelligibilility of the
defining statement. In Pearson’s words [20] “the
superordinate or closest generic concept should preferably
be one step up in the hierarchy from the term being
defined”. Moreover, the same superordinate should be used
for all terms that belong to the same class.
5. MTT lexicographic tools and
BADELE.3000
In order to get more accurate systematic definitions, we
decided to use the MTT tools. We considered two possible
ways, (a) applying these tools directly to the ontology; (b)
using them to enrich a general purpose lexicographic
resource which could be later reused in other applications,
for instance, for mapping the PhenomenOntology. At this
point, we studied the advantages and disadvantages of the
database BADELE.3000 [1, 2] that had been developed
according to some MTT lexicographic tools.
BADELE.3000 is a database that contains the 3,000
most frequently used Spanish nouns. The information of
each noun includes the definition and the combinatorial
possibilities, among other linguistic information. A
systematic process for the design of the database was
followed; consequently the lexical data are well structured
and separated from the applications that might use them.
This way, the features of the data model and the subsequent
database make them useful for different purposes, such as
word sense disambiguation, machine translation and text
generation.
As a result, the database contains a minimum of
information useful for any type of ontology (because the
general vocabulary includes some basic terms transversal to
any specific domain) and more than 20,000 combinations.
Besides, this resource allows us to infer knowledge
potentially useful in real applications.
However, BADELE.3000 is a general-purpose
resource with a low utility in commercial exploitations as it
does not contain crucial information for real applications.
The medium, long-term objective is to enrich this generic
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999859166666667">
linguistic resource by formalizing definitions which can
help infer conceptual knowledge
Thus, our aim is twofold: To solve the problems of
definition extraction and to add domain knowledge to a
general purpose linguistic resource. The process followed is
presented in Fig. 2.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.973376">
Fig. 2. Definition extraction and systematic
lexicalization during BADELE upgrade
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746">
As for the lexicographic tools applied to BADELE.3000,
we have resorted to three concepts proposed by the
Meaning-Text Theory (MTT).
The first one is the lexical function (LF) [17: 39-40]: a
LF associates a given lexical expression L (such as sound),
which is the argument or keyword of F, with a set of lexical
expressions –the value of F (such as loud, strong, heavy,
deafening, etc). – expressing a specific meaning associated
with F (for instance, ‘intense’ for the examples just
mentioned which correspond to the LF known as Magn).
The second concept is the semantic label: a semantic
label is the equivalent to the genus in traditional definitions
by genus and differentia. For instance, whale could be
defined as a ‘sea mammal that breathes air through a hole
at the top of its head and is hunted for meat and for other
purposes, as a source of other materials’. The first part of
this definition, ‘sea mammal’, the genus, is known in MTT
approach as semantic label; the second part of this
definition, the differentia, can be attached to some LFs.
The third concept is the actant [14, 15] and its derivate,
the actantial structure. Actants correspond to beings or
things that participate in the process expressed by a
predicate: MTT approach considers that there is a sort of
argument structure in all kinds of predicative words, which
means that not only do the verbs have actants but also the
adjectives, adverbs and the predicative nouns. The actantial
structure reflects the syntactic expression of the actants, as
shown in the example of fleuve (river) of Dicouèbe, in

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863416666667">
Among these three concepts, LFs have proved to be a
specially helpful tool for lexicographic works such as the
French dictionary DECFC1, the French database
Dicouèbe2(developed in Montreal by Polguère and
Mel’cuk) and the Spanish database DiCE3 (developed in La
Coruña by Alonso Ramos). Fontenelle [5] has also created
(semiautomatically) a database but its originality derives
from the fact that he takes as source bilingual dictionaries
enriched with lexical-semantic information based on LFs.
According to Frawley [6] the methodology followed by
these resources is ideally suited to the compilation of
specialized dictionaries.

6. Problems and solutions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963105263158">
In section 3 two problems have been pointed out when
describing the definition extraction process. The low ratio
of retrieved definitions can be solved by using linguistic
resources (such as domain lexicons, WordNet, etc.) during
the label search. So, term variants and semantically
equivalent terms could be found and their definitions would
be retrieved. The total number of definitions retrieved
would increase. However, these definitions would show the
same inconsistencies derived from the different granularity
and specificity compared to existent ontology definitions.
That is, the main problem in the whole process is the
linguistic realization of definitions.
Thus, we have mainly focused on three subsidiary
problems derived from the above mentioned problem and
proposed some solutions according to MTT: (a) semantic
labels as a solution for inferring knowledge, (b) lexical
functions as a way of providing coherence to definitions
and (c) the actancial structure as a tool for developing
consistent and complete definitions.

The first problem that the technical definitions extracted
from the knowledge resources used show is the
inconsistencies between the name of the label of a group of
terms (such as INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION) and the
first part of the definition, i.e. the superordinate of every
single term under this label (such as construction, ranch,
installation, building), because it differs from one to

another, as Table 1 shows. The following question could be
raised, why is a farm defined as a ‘ranch’, a corral as a
‘construction’, a fish farm as an ‘installation’ and a pigeon
loft as a ‘building’?
It is clear that the first part of every definition is used
in an intuitive way as a quasi-synonym of the genus of the
remaining definitions of the group. But in our view it is a
false quasi-synonym. As a matter of fact, native Spanish
speakers do not use ranch, building, container or
installation as synonyms. This raises a second question,
why all these words share the label but not the genus of the
definition?

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.995489">
6.1.2 Solution: Semantic labels
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999649090909091">
The last question leads us to propose the use of semantic
labels as envisaged in the MTT approach mentioned in
section 5. A semantic label would correspond to the genus
that matches the superordinate of the definition.
Consequently, we propose the use of semantic labels as
superordinates in the first part of the definition as a possible
solution to avoid inconsistencies. In the examples in Table
2, we have used INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATION as a
semantic label of the entire group, so all the definitions
begin with the same superordinate. Table 3 shows our
proposal.

<bodyText confidence="0.5268526">
Sometimes simple terms (nouns) or complex terms that
share semantic features are defined differently. This
inconsistency can be really subtle, as the example in Table
4 shows, based on the definitions of bancal (slope) and
ladera abancalada (terrace slope).

The two terms share all the semantic features, in other
words, the basic characteristics. That would justify why the
two definitions are almost equal. However, focusing on the
object of the definitions, we find one definition is
embedded in the other because a terrace slope is a set of
slopes.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.998338">
6.2.2 Solution: lexical functions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998692">
LFs are a powerful tool in order to give coherence to the
definitions. Actually, the LF Mult could be quite useful in
this and other similar cases. This LF expresses the sense
‘set of X’, where X is an argument that is usually filled by
nouns, such as grape, or flower, as shown in (1):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.874639">
(1) Mult(grape) = bunch of
Mult(flower) = bouquet of, bunch of
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999126">
This LF can correspond to some lexical units that are
not related syntagmatically (as examples above) but
paradigmatically (in these cases, the value of the LF is
preceded by the symbol //). Consequently, the final version
of the entry of bancal in our database contains this LF, as
shown in (2):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.836953">
(2) Mult(bancal) = //ladera abancalada
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925428571429">
The sense Mult is usually present at the beginning of
definitions. For instance, the first sense of bunch is defined
in the Oxford Dictionary as a number of things growing
together, and the second one as a group of people. If we use
the LF Mult in order to construct the definition, we should
use set of (bancales) as the first part of ladera abancalada.
Our proposal is shown in Table 5.

We have found definitions with different granularity in the

fact that one definition is more explicit than another; or
rather, it sometimes implies different entries in each
document, such as bus station (present at BTN.25
document) and depot station (present at BCN.25
document), where depot is a hypernym of bus, as shown in

7. Conclusions and Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999855">
MTT has shown the potential advantages of using a
systematic approach for defining terms as it builds on the
relations established among the relevant information
included in definitions and it allows for some sort of
semantic network formed with all the elements present in
the definitions. In the process of definition extraction from
the domain resources used two problems appeared:
semantic inconsistency between different definitions for a
concept (term), and very low efficiency of automatic
definition search in auxiliary dictionaries. These problems
have been described and some solutions have been
proposed. Thus, we can conclude that MTT tools are very
powerful in order to define or redefine terms. Semantic
labels have proved to be consistent as superordinates; LFs
are useful when choosing the essential sense of some
definitions; and, finally, the actantial structure helps to
complete other incomplete definitions.
As future work, our proposal would aim at developing
an extraction methodology that could be documented in
order to set the steps for automatic extraction. Thus, the
manual process above mentioned could be described in
detail as the problematic cases are identified and solved so
as to identify all the possible activities than can be
automatized. To sum up, the final objective is to build a
framework which supports definition extraction as
automatically as possible. This framework will help experts

<abstract confidence="0.999932">Enriching linguistic resources with domain information has been considered one important target in natural language applications. However, automatic definition extraction of this domain information from specialized resources has revealed certain methodological problems in definition construction. This paper presents some problems encountered in automatic definition extraction that are mainly related to inconsistencies in definitions, different granularity of definitions and embedded definitions. To face these problems some Meaning-Text Theory tools have been used: (a) semantic labels as a solution for inferring knowledge, (b) lexical functions as a way of providing coherence to definitions and (c) the actancial structure as a tool for developing consistent and complete definitions. Our goal is to describe the problems and to show the solutions proposed.</abstract>

Definition extraction Definition extraction, as used in this paper, is the process of extracting the definition for a term from different resources. In our case these definitions have not been taken from corpora using machine learning techniques, as in many natural language processing applications [3], but from other domain resources with explicit definitions for these terms, their term variants or other semantically equivalent terms. However, some problems have appeared in this definition extraction process that showed certain inconsistencies and loss of information. The definition extraction process followed to build and enrich a domain ontology is as follows: (1) the application we have developed retrieves the term from “Capture rules for GI to be included in BTN25”; (2) it extracts its definition from the same document; (3) it searches for the term in the auxiliary domain dictionaries;</context>

This type of definition is traditionally called formal definition, or intensional definition [8, 9]. That is to say, it reflects the superordinate concept to which the designation belongs and its delimiting characteristics. However, there are also other ways of designating concepts, extensional, ostensive, lexical, precising, and stipulative definitions [8] as well as ontological definitions [4]. For a more exhaustive revision on definitions see [13, 12]. Although these definitions can be useful for certain purposes depending on the user’s needs and the approach adopted, they do not conform to a certain defining formulation and hinder any possibilities of formalizing the knowledge expressed in definitions in order to be used for natural language applications, such as knowledge extraction, ontology enrichment, to mention just a few. For this reason, we claim that some recommendations regarding terminological definitions should be considered when preparing domain resources.

In this paper, we present the problems encountered when trying to reuse three domain resources for two different purposes: (a) to build an ontology and (b) to populate a general linguistic resource, a database, with specific information from domain documents. With the aim of developing a consistent linguistic resource for further use in natural language applications, we focus on achieving consistent definitions of domain terms. Accordingly, we resort to the MeaningText Theory (MTT) principles [16] to propose some systematic solutions in order to avoid the inconsistency problems when building a terminological resource that can later be used in ontology development. Thus, we have mainly focused on three fundamental aspects: (a) semantic labels as a solution for inferring knowledge, (b) lexical functions as a way of providing coherence to definitions and (c) the actancial structure as a tool for developing consistent and complete definitions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we provide the scenario in which we have based our research and the tools used. Section </context>

Finally, some conclusions are outlined in section 7. 2. Background The domain resources used in this project summarized in this section (for more details, see Gómez-Pérez et al [7]) relate to geographic and geospatial information. All geographic information (GI) resources contain data about real entities and how to represent them in a map. So, each entity corresponds to an instance of a geographic phenomenon (feature). Indeed, the most important concept for GI is the feature since the Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC) [19] has declared that a geographic feature is the starting point for modelling geospatial information. In other words, a feature, which is the basic unit of GI, is an abstraction of a real world phenomenon associated with a location relative to the Earth, about which data are collected, maintained and disseminated [11]. Features can 14 Workshop On Definition Extraction 2009 - Borovets, Bulgaria, pages 14–20, include representations of a wide range of phenomena that can be located in time and space such as buildings, towns and villages or a geometric network, a geo-referenced image, pixel or thema</context>

For this reason, we claim that some recommendations regarding terminological definitions should be considered when preparing domain resources. As [9, 10] stipulates the selection of an appropriate superordinate is crucial for the intelligibilility of the defining statement. In Pearson’s words [20] “the superordinate or closest generic concept should preferably be one step up in the hierarchy from the term being defined”. Moreover, the same superordinate should be used for all terms that belong to the same class. 5. MTT lexicographic tools and BADELE.3000 In order to get more accurate systematic definitions, we decided to use the MTT tools. We considered two possible ways, (a) applying these tools directly to the ontology; (b) using them to enrich a general purpose lexicographic resource which could be later reused in other applications, for instance, for mapping the PhenomenOntology.
