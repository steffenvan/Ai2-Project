We discuss work-in-progress on a hybrid ap-
proach to the generation of spatial descriptions,
using the maps of the Map Task dialogue cor-
pus as domain models. We treat spatial de-
scriptions as referring expressions that distin-
guish particular points on the maps from all
other points (potential ‘distractors’). Our ap-
proach is based on rule-based overgeneration
of spatial descriptions combined with ranking
which currently is based on explicit goodness
criteria but will ultimately be corpus-based.
Ranking for content determination tasks such
as referring expression generation raises a num-
ber of deep and vexing questions about the role
of corpora in NLG, the kind of knowledge they
can provide and how it is used.
1 Introduction, or: The lack of domain
model annotation in corpora used for
ranking in NLG
In recent years, ranking approaches to Natural Language
Generation (NLG) have become increasingly popular.
They abandon the idea of generation as a determinis-
tic decision-making process in favour of approaches that
combine overgeneration with ranking at some stage in
processing. A major motivation is the potential reduc-
tion of manual development costs and increased adapt-
ability and robustness.
Several approaches to sentence realization use rank-
ing models trained on corpora of human-authored texts
to judge the fluency of the candidates produced by the
generation system. The work of [Langkilde and Knight,
1998; Langkilde, 2002] describes a sentence realizer that
uses word ngram models trained on a corpus of 250 mil-
lion words to rank candidates. [Varges and Mellish, 2001]
present an approach to sentence realization that employs
an instance-based ranker trained on a semantically an-
notated subset of the Penn treebank II (‘Who’s News’
texts). [Ratnaparkhi, 2000] describes a sentence realizer
that had been trained on a domain-specific corpus (in the
air travel domain) augmented with semantic attribute-
value pairs. [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000] describe a
realizer that uses a word ngram model combined with
a tree-based stochastic model trained on a version of
the Penn treebank annotated in XTAG grammar format.
[Karamanis et al., 2004] discuss centering-based metrics
of coherence that could be used for choosing among com-
peting text structures. The metrics are derived from the
Gnome corpus [Poesio et al., 2004].
In sum, these approaches use corpora with various
types of annotation: syntactic trees, semantic roles, text
structure, or no annotation at all (for word-based ngram
models). However, what they all have in common, even
when dealing with higher-level text structures, is the ab-
sence of any domain model annotation, i.e. information
about the available knowledge pool from which the con-
tent was chosen. This seems to be unproblematic for
surface realization where the semantic input has been
determined beforehand.
This paper asks what the lack of domain information
means for ranking in the context of content determina-
tion, focusing on the generation of referring expressions
(GRE). A particularly intriguing aspect of GRE is the
role of distractors in choosing the content (types, at-
tributes, relations) used to describe the target object(s).
For example, we may describe a target as ‘the red car’
if there is also a blue one, but we may just describe it
as ‘the car’ if there are no other cars in the domain (but
possibly objects of other types). [Stone, 2003] proposes
to use this observation to reason backwards from a given
referring expression to the state of the knowledge base
that motivated it. We may call this the ‘presupposi-
tional’ or ‘abductive’ view of GRE. The approach is in-
tended to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck
in NLG by means of example specifications constructed
for the purpose of knowledge acquisition. It seems to us
that, if the approach were to be applied to actual text
corpora, one needed to address the fact that people of-
ten include ‘redundant’ attributes that do not eliminate
any distractors. Thus, ‘the red car’ does not necessar-
ily presuppose the existence of another car of different
colour. Furthermore, there are likely to be a large num-
ber of domain models/knowledge bases that could have
motivated the production of a referring expression.
[Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004] take a corpus-
based perspective and essentially regard a text as a
knowledge base from which descriptions of domain ob-
jects can be extracted. Some NPs are descriptions of
the same object (for example if they have the same head
noun and share attributes and relations in certain ways),
others are deemed distractors. It seems that, in contrast
to [Stone, 2003], this approach cannot recover those do-
main objects or properties that are never mentioned be-
cause it only extracts what is explicitly stated in the
text.
Both the work reported in [Stone, 2003] and in [Sid-
dharthan and Copestake, 2004] can be seen as attempts
to deal with the lack of domain model information in
situations where only the surface forms of referring ex-
pressions are given. Obtaining such a domain model
is highly desirable in order to establish which part of
a larger knowledge pool is actually selected for realiza-
tion. This could be used to automatically learn models
of content selection, for example. However, as we ob-
served above, most corpora do not provide this kind of
knowledge for obvious practical reasons. For example,
how can we know what knowledge a Wall Street Journal
author had available at the time of writing?
In this paper, we describe work-in-progress on exploit-
ing a corpus that provides not only surface forms but
also domain model information: the MapTask dialogue
corpus [Anderson et al., 1991].
2 Spatial descriptions as referring
expressions
In the Map Task dialogues, a subject gives route direc-
tions to another subject, involving the production of de-
scriptions such as ‘at the left-hand side of the banana
tree’ and ‘about three quarters up on the page, to the
extreme left’. 16 Maps and 32 subjects (8 groups of 4
speakers) were used to produce 128 dialogues. The sub-
jects were not able to see each other’s maps and thus
had to resort to verbal descriptions of the map contents.
There are some (intentional) mismatches the subject’s
maps such as additional landmarks, changed names etc.
This is a good source of spatial descriptions, for exam-
ple: ‘have you got gorillas? ... well, they’re in the bottom
left-hand corner.’
Figure 1 shows one of the ‘giver’ maps, which, in
contrast to the corresponding ‘follower’ map, shows the
route the follower is supposed to take. A main charac-
teristic of both giver and follower maps is the display of
named landmarks. These names typically refer to the
type of the landmark. With a few exceptions, for exam-
ple the ‘great viewpoint’ in figure 1, most of the land-
mark names only occur once. This seems to make it dif-
ficult to use the MapTask dialogues from the perspective
of GRE: the names/types rule out most distractors and
there is not much left to do for a GRE algorithm. How-
ever, as can be seen in figure 1, the routes do not lead
through the landmarks but rather around them along
feature-less points. The subjects of the MapTask exper-
iments therefore often refer to points on the route, for

example to those where the next turn had to be taken.
These observations can be used to frame the genera-
tion of spatial descriptions as a GRE task in which target
points on the map are distinguished from all other points
(the distractors). Since most points are feature-less, two
of the properties commonly used in GRE, types and at-
tributes, cannot be used in many cases. This leaves the
third property, relations, which can be used by a GRE
algorithm to relate the target position to surrounding
landmarks on the maps. This is also what the subjects
in the MapTask experiments are doing.
Our current, on-going work addresses the generation of
descriptions referring to individual points on the maps.
Ultimately, we hope to move on to the generation of de-
scriptions of (straight) paths encompassing start and end
points, and a description of how to travel between these.
Looking at the MapTask corpus from the perspective of
GRE, we make the following observations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981665888888889">
• The MapTask corpus consists of transcriptions of
spoken language and contains many disfluencies. A
spatial description can even span more than one
turn, for example: ‘okay ... fine move ... upwards
... an– ... so that you’re to the left of the broken
gate .’ TURN ‘and just level to the gatepost .’ We
expect more polished, written language as output of
our generator.
• GRE only deals with a subset of the corpus. We
need to find ways of making use of the appropriate
parts of the data while ignoring the other ones.
• Spatial descriptions containing some form of vague-
ness seem to be frequent:1 ‘quite close to the moun-
tain on its right-hand side’, ‘just before the middle
of the page’, ‘a bit up from the fallen pillars on the
left’, ‘about two inches southwest’. There even seem
to be rare cases of vague types: ‘a sort of curve’.
• Discourse context is of crucial importance, i.e. many
spatial descriptions do not mention a particular
point for the first time. Furthermore, already es-
tablished information is not always given explicitly,
for example ‘two inches to the left [from where I am
now].’
• Perspective is a related issue: it seems that the sub-
jects zoom in on parts of the map, ignoring for ex-
ample a second lake at the other end of the map.
• The subjects switch between referring to objects

<bodyText confidence="0.882893272727273">
from an inside-the-map perspective (‘beneath the
tree’) to using the physical maps as a perspective
(‘a couple of centimeters ... from the bottom of the
page’). The latter may be caused by the lack of a
grid indicating the distances in miles or kilometers.
In sum, the MapTask corpus contains a wealth of data
combined with a domain model (the maps). The chal-
lenge is to make best use of these resources. In the fol-
lowing sections, we report on work-in-progress on hybrid
rule-based/instance-based generation of spatial referring
expressions.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896176470588">
Following the inferential approach to GRE [Varges, 2004;
Varges and van Deemter, 2005], we are implementing a
system that finds all combinations of properties that are
true of a given target referent and distinguish it from
its distractors. The approach pairs the logical forms de-
rived from a domain representation with the correspond-
ing ‘extensions’, the set of objects that the logical form
denotes. We represent spatial domains as grids and do-
main objects (landmarks) as sets of coordinates of those
grids. For example, the telephone kiosk in figure 1 is
represented as the set {(2,18), (2,19)}. The grid resolu-
tion has implications for the definition of targets, which
are, in fact, target areas, i.e. they often consist of more
than one coordinate.
We implemented a number of content determination
rules that recursively build up descriptions, starting from
(NPs realizing) the landmarks of the domain model:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994025714285714">
1. spatial functions: Prep NP → PP: ‘above the west
lake’. The spatial functions used so far are: ‘above’,
‘below’, ‘to the left of’, ‘to the right of’.
2. intersection: PP and PP → PP: ‘above the west
lake and to the left of the great viewpoint’.
3. union: NP or NP → NP: ‘the stile or the ruined
monastery’.

The descriptions generated by these rules are all associ-
ated with an extension. For example ‘above X’ denotes
all all the points above X (this may be changed to those
points that are also ‘close’ to X). The grid in figure 2
is a graphical depiction of an extension associated with
the disjoined NPs shown on the right. All generated
descriptions can be visualized in this way.
The three content determination rules listed above are
not sufficient for singling out all areas of the maps. For
example, the corners of the maps are typically not ‘reach-
able’. Therefore, we define a further rule:
4. recursive spatial functions: Prep PP → PP: ‘above
the points to the left of the farmer’s gate’.
We intend to generate a wide variety of realization can-
didates. For example, rule 4 could also produce the more
fluent (and realistic) ‘above the farmer’s gate slightly to
the left’, which will also require us to make vagueness
more precise. An alternative is to use non-recursive PPs
like ‘southeast of X’.

<bodyText confidence="0.98559025">
As candidates for ranking we use those NPs and PPs that
contain at least one target coordinate, a loose definition
that increases the number of candidates. We always gen-
erate NP ‘the points’ as a candidate which refers to all
coordinates. However, it should be ranked low because
it does not rule out any distractors. We currently use
the ratio of extension size to described target coordi-
nates as our first (non-empirical) ranking criterion (‘e/t’
below). The second (non-empirical) criterion is brevity,
measured by the number of characters (‘chars’). Here
are some ranked output candidates for the target area
labeled ‘#’ in figure 2 (which contains two points):

and to the left of the telephone kiosk 2
2 88 above the points to the left of the
farmer’s gate and to the left of the
telephone kiosk 2
10 32 to the left of the farmer’s gate 10
225 10 the points 450
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.978336527777778">
The first candidate is preferred because it has the same
e/t ratio as some of its competitors but in addition is also
shorter than these. In fact, this is how one of the subjects
refers to the starting point in one of the dialogues. The
third candidate requires the use of appropriate bracket-
ing to yield the desired reading. For example, the gen-
erator could introduce a comma after ‘gate’.
5 Toward using empirical data for
ranking
The generation rules sketched above produce non-
redundant spatial descriptions, i.e. the generator is ‘eco-
nomical’ [Stone, 2003] and follows the ‘local brevity’ in-
terpretation of the Gricean Maxims [Dale and Reiter,
1995]. The candidate of least ‘complexity’ is the ‘full
brevity’ solution. A word similarity-based ranker could
align the generation output (i.e. the highest-ranked can-
didate) with previous utterances in the discourse con-
text. To increase choice, we intend to also generate ad-
ditional candidates that include a limited amount of re-
dundant information. One could furthermore generate
candidates that, by themselves, do not rule out all dis-
tractors. In contrast to the inclusion of redundant in-
formation, these candidates would only be safe to use
in combination with, for example, a reliable model of
discourse salience that reduces the set of possible dis-
tractors.
It is possible (but not without difficulty) to annotate
parts of the corpus with map coordinates. For exam-
ple, we can annotate the turn ‘on the right side of the
tree’ with coordinates (15,9), (15,10) in figure 2. Further
markup could be applied to ‘redundant’ information (in
the GRE sense) or highlight available discourse context.
However, for obvious reasons it is preferable to use cor-
pus data without any additional annotation for ranking.
The maps enable us to determine how much we gain from
the availability of a domain model.
