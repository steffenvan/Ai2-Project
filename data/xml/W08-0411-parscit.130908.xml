Phrase-based Statistical MT (PB-SMT) (Koehn et
al., 2003) has become the predominant approach to
Machine Translation in recent years. PB-SMT re-
quires broad-coverage databases of phrase-to-phrase
translation equivalents. These are commonly ac-
quired from large volumes of automatically word-
aligned sentence-parallel text corpora. Accurate
identification of sub-sentential translation equiva-
lents, however, is a critical process in all data-driven
MT approaches, including a variety of data-driven
syntax-based approaches that have been developed
in recent years. (Chiang, 2005) (Imamura et al.,

In this paper, we describe a multi-step process for
automatically learning reliable sub-sentential syn-
tactic phrases that are translation equivalents of each
other and syntactic translation rules between two
languages. The input to the process is a corpus of
parallel sentences, word-aligned and annotated with
phrase-structure parse trees for both languages. Our
method consists of three steps. In the first step,
we apply a newly developed algorithm for aligning
parse-tree nodes between the two parallel trees. In
the second step, we extract all aligned sub-sentential
syntactic constituents from the parallel sentences,
and create a syntax-based phrase-table. Our syn-
tactic phrases come with constituent “labels” which
can guide their syntactic function during decoding.
In the final step, we treat the node alignments as
tree decomposition points and extract from the cor-
pus all possible synchronous parallel tree fragments.
These are then converted into synchronous context-
free rules. Our methods do not depend on any spe-
cific properties of the underlying phrase-structure
representations or the parsers used, and were de-
signed to be applicable even when these represen-
tations are quite different for the two languages.
The approach described is used to acquire the re-
sources for a statistical syntax-based MT approach
that we have developed (Stat-XFER), briefly de-
scribed below. The resulting resources can, how-
ever, be used in any syntax-based data-driven MT
approach other than our own. The focus of this pa-
per is on our syntax-driven process for extracting
phrases and rules from data. We describe the ap-
proach and analyze its effectiveness when applied to
large-volumes of Chinese-English parallel data.

Stat-XFER is a search-based syntax-driven frame-
work for building MT systems. The underlying for-
malism is based on synchronous context-free gram-
mars. The synchronous rules can optionally be aug-
mented by unification-style feature constraints. The
synchronous grammars can be acquired automati-
cally from data, but also manually developed by ex-
perts. A simple example transfer-rule (for Chinese-

Each rule has a unique identifier followed by a
synchronous rule for both source and target sides.
The alignment of source-to-target constituents is ex-
plicitly represented using ’X’ indices for the source
side, and ’Y’ indices for the target side. Rules can
also have lexical items on either side, in which case
no alignment information is required for these ele-
ments. Feature constraints can optionally be speci-
fied for both source and target elements of the rule.
We do not address the learning of feature constraints
in the work described here, and concentrate only
on the acquisition of the synchronous CFG rules.
The rules can be modeled statistically and assigned
scores, which can then be used as decoding features.
The Stat-XFER framework also includes a fully-
implemented transfer engine that applies the trans-
fer grammar to a source-language input sentence at
runtime, and produces collections of scored word
and phrase-level translations according to the gram-
mar. These are collected into a lattice data-structure.
Scores are based on a log-linear combination of sev-
eral features, and a beam-search controls the un-
derlying parsing and transfer process. A second-
stage monotonic decoder is responsible for combin-
ing translation fragments into complete translation
hypotheses (Lavie, 2008)

2.1 Objectives of the Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964210526316">
Our objective of the first stage of our approach is to
detect sub-sentential constituent correspondences in
parallel sentences, based on phrase-structure parses
for the two corresponding sentences. Given a pair
of parallel sentences and their corresponding parse
trees, our goal is to find pairings of nodes in the
source and target trees whose yields are translation
equivalents of each other. Our current approach only
considers complete constituents and their contigious
yields, and will therefore not align discontiguous
phrases or partial constituents. Similar to phrase ex-
traction methods in PB-SMT, we rely on word-level
alignments (derived manually or automatically) as
indicators for translation equivalence. The assump-
tion applied is that if two words are aligned with
each other, they carry the same meaning and can be
treated as translation equivalents. Constituents are
treated as compositional units of meaning and trans-
lation equivalence.

Aligning nodes in parallel trees has been in-
vestigated by a number of previous researchers.
(Samuelsson and Volk, 2007) describe a process for
manual alignment of nodes in parallel trees. This
approach is well suited for generating reliable par-
allel treebanks, but is impractical for accumulating
resources from large parallel data. (Tinsley et al.,
2007) use statistical lexicons derived from automatic
statistical word alignment for aligning nodes in par-
allel trees. In our approach, we use the word align-
ment information directly, which we believe may be
more reliable than the statistical lexicon. (Groves et
al., 2004) propose a method of aligning nodes be-
tween parallel trees automatically, based on word
alignments. In addition to the word alignment in-
formation, their approach uses the constituent labels
of nodes in the trees, and the general structure of the
tree. Our approach is more general in the sense that
we only consider the word alignments, thereby mak-
ing the approach applicable to any parser or phrase-
structure representation, even ones that are quite dif-
ferent for the two languages involved.

2.3 Unaligned Words and Contiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986611111111">
Word-level alignment of phrase-level translation
equivalents often leaves some words unaligned. For
example, some languages have articles, while oth-
ers do not. It is thus reasonable to expect that con-
stituent pairs in parallel trees that are good transla-
tion equivalents of each other may contain some un-
aligned words. Our PFA node-alignment algorithm
allows for such constituents to be matched.
Different languages have different word orders. In
English, an adjective always comes before a noun,
while in French, in most cases, the adjective fol-
lows its noun. Our node alignment algorithm allows
aligning of constituents regardless of the word order
expressed by the linear precedence relation of their
sub-constituents. As long as one piece of contiguous
text dominated by a node covers the same word-level
alignments as the yield of a node in the parallel tree,
the two nodes can be aligned.

2.4 Wellformedness constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968108777777778">
Given a pair of word-aligned sentences and their
corresponding parse trees S and T, represented as
sets of constituent nodes, our PFA node alignment
algorithm produces a collection of aligned node-
pairs (Si, Tj). The underlying assumptions of com-
positionality in meaning and word-level alignments
being indicative of translation equivalence lead di-
rectly to the following node alignment wellformed-
ness criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981567095238095">
1. If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then any
node within the subtree of node Si can only be
linked to nodes within the subtree of node Tj.
2. If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then any
node that dominates the node Si can only be
linked to nodes that dominate the node Tj.
3. If a node Si is linked to a node Tj, then the
word alignments of the yields of the two con-
stituents must satisfy the following:
(a) Every word in the yield of the node Si
must be aligned to one or more words in
the yield of the node Tj, or it should be
unaligned.
(b) Every word in the yield of the node Tj
must be aligned to one or more words in
the yield of the node Si, or it should be
unaligned.
(c) There should be at least one alignment be-
tween the yields of nodes Si and Tj. Thus,
the words in the yields can not all be un-
aligned.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995736">
2.5 Arithmetic Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999622">
Our PFA algorithm uses a arithmetic mapping that
elegently carries over the constraints characterized
by the wellformedness constraints elaborated above.
This mapping is designed to ensure that each aligned
word, which carries a distinct “piece of meaning”
can be uniquely identified, and also inherently re-
flects the compositional properties of constituent
translation equivalence. This is accomplished by
assigning numerical values to the nodes of the two
parse trees being aligned, in a bottom-up fashion,
starting from the leaf nodes of the trees. Leaf nodes
that correspond to words that are aligned are each
assigned a unique prime number. Unaligned leaf
nodes are assigned a value of “1”. Constituent nodes
in the parse trees are then assigned a value that is
the product of all its sub-constituent nodes. Because
of the arithmetic property that any composite num-
ber can be uniquely factored into primes, it should
be evident that the value of every constituent node
uniquely identifies the aligned words that are cov-
ered by its yield. Consequently, by assigning the
same prime values to the aligned words of both trees,
retrieving aligned constituent nodes is as simple as
finding the set of nodes in the two trees that carry the
same numerical value. Note that by assigning values
of “1” to unaligned words, these unaligned words
do not influence the numerical values assigned to
constituent nodes, thus reflecting their treatment as
“don’t cares” with respect to the translation equiva-
lence of constituent nodes.

The PFA algorithm uses the concept of ‘composite
meaning as prime factorization’, and hence the name
(Prime Factorization and Alignments). The algo-
rithm assigns values to the leaf nodes, propogates
the values up the tree, and then compares the node
values across the trees to align the nodes. As de-
scribed above, leaf nodes which have word align-
ments are assigned unique prime numbers, and the

same prime is assigned to the corresponding aligned
words in the parallel sentences. Leaf nodes corre-
sponding to unaligned words are assigned the value
“1”. The treatment of “one-to-many” word align-
ments is a special case. Such alignments are con-
sidered to carry the same meaning, and should thus
be assigned the same value. To accomplish this, if a
single word is aligned to multiple words in the other
language, we assign the same prime number to all
words on the “multiple” side, and assign the product
of these to the single word equivalent.
Another special case is when the parse trees con-
tain unary productions. In this case, the values of
both nodes involved in this production are the same.
Our node alignment algorithm breaks this “tie” by
selecting the node that is “lower” in the tree (the
daughter node of the unary production). A simi-
lar situation with two nodes being assigned identical
values can arise when one or more unaligned words
are attached directly to the parent node. Here too,
our algorithm aligns the “lower” node and leaves
the “higher” node unaligned. These decisions reflect
our desire to be conservative with respect to such
ambiguous cases, and their implications on the no-
tion of translational equivalence. This also provides
some robustness against noisy alignments.
It is straightfoward to verify that the PFA algo-
rithm satisfies the wellformedness constraints de-
scribed above. Also, since multiplication is com-
mutative, the algorithm is not effected by differing
word orders within parallel constituent structures.
The PFA algorithm run on a sample Chinese-
English parallel sentence is shown in Figure 1. The
value of each node as shown as a part of its label.
The aligned nodes are marked by shapes. A triangle

The alignment of nodes as described in the previous
section allows us to build a comprehensive syntax-
based phrase-to-phrase translation lexicon from a
parallel corpus. To build a syntax-based “phrase
table”, we simply extract all aligned constituent
nodes along with their yields and enter them into
a database, while accumulating frequency counts.
In addition to the source-to-target phrase corre-
spondences, we record the constituent labels of the
aligned constituent nodes on both the source and tar-
get sides (which may be different). These labels
“connect” the phrases with synatactic transfer rules
during decoding. The set of phrases extracted from
the example sentence in Figure 1 is shown in Fig-

The process of building syntax-based “phrase ta-

quite similar to the corresponding process in phrase-
based SMT systems. Our phrase correspondences,
however, only reflect contiguous and complete con-
stituent correspondences. We also note that the ex-
tracted phrase tables in both approaches can be mod-
eled statistically in similar ways. Similar to common
practice in PB-SMT, we currently use the frequency
counts of the phrases to calculate relative likelihood
estimates and use these as features in our Stat-XFER
decoder.

The accuracy of our node alignment algorithm de-

these underlying resources on the accuracy of our
approach. The most accurate condition is when the
parallel sentences are manually word-aligned, and
when verified correct parse trees are available for
both source and target sentences. Performance is
expected to degrade when word alignments are pro-

resulting node alignments with the gold standard

We manually inspected cases where there was a
mismatch between the manual and automatic node
alignments, and found several trends. Many of
the alignment differences were the result of one-to-
many or many-to-many word alignemnts. For ex-
ample, in some cases a verb in Chinese was word-
aligned to an auxiliary and a head verb on the en-
glish side (e.g. have and put). The PFA algorithm
in this case node-aligns the VP that governs the Chi-
nese verb to the VP that contains both auxiliary and
head verbs on the English side. The gold standard
human alignments, however, in some cases, aligned
the VP of the Chinese verb to the English VP that
governs just the main verb. Other mismatches were
attributed to errors or inconsistencies in the manual
word alignment and to the treatment of traces and
fillers in the parse trees.

Syntax-based reordering rules can be used as a pre-
processing step for PB-SMT (and other approaches),
to decrease the word-order and syntactic distor-
tion between the source and target languages (Xia
and McCord, 2004). A variety of hierarchical and
syntax-based models, which are applied during de-
coding, have also been developed. Many of these
approaches involve automatic learning and extrac-
tion of the underlying syntax-based rules from data.
The underlying formalisms used has been quite
broad and include simple formalisms such as ITGs
(Wu, 1997), hierarchical synchronous rules (Chiang,
2005), string to tree models by (Galley et al., 2004)
and (Galley et al., 2006), synchronous CFG models
such (Xia and McCord, 2004) (Yamada and Knight,
2001), synchronous Lexical Functional Grammar
inspired approaches (Probst et al., 2002) and others.
Most of the previous approaches for acquiring
syntactic transfer or reordering rules from paral-
lel corpora use syntactic information from only one
side of the parallel corpus, typically the target side.
(Hearne and Way, 2003) describes an approach that
uses syntactic information from the source side to
derive reordering subtrees, which can then be used
within a “data-oriented translation” (DOT) MT sys-
tem, similar in framework to (Poutsma, 2000). Our
work is different from the above in that we use syn-
tactic trees for both source and target sides to infer
constituent node alignments, from which we then
learn synchronous trees and rules. Our process of
extraction of rules as synchronous trees and then
converting them to synchronous CFG rules is most
similar to that of (Galley et al., 2004).

5.2 Synchronous Tree Fragment Pair
Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999505">
The main concept underlying our syntactic rule ex-
traction process is that we treat the node alignments
discovered by the PFA algorithm (described in pre-
vious sections) as synchronous tree decomposition
points. This reflects the fact that these nodes denote
points in the synchronous parse trees where transla-
tion correspondences can be put together composi-
tionally. Using the aligned nodes as decomposition
points, we break apart the synchronous trees into
collections of minimal synchronous tree fragments.
Finally, the synchronous fragments are also con-
verted into synchronous context-free rules. These
are then collected into a database of synchronous
rules.
The input to our rule extraction process consists of
the parallel parse trees along with their node align-
ment information. The constituent nodes in the par-
allel trees that were aligned by the PFA node align-
ment algorithm are treated as tree decomposition
points. At each such decomposition point, spliting
the two parallel trees results in two partial trees or
tree fragments. One synchronous pair consists of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990059">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998175">
the subtrees that are headed by the aligned nodes
where the decomposition took place. Since the sub-
trees are rooted at aligned nodes, their yields are
translation equivalents of each other. The other syn-
chronous tree fragment pair consists of the remain-
ing portions of the trees. The translation equivalence
of the complete tree (or subtree) prior to decomposi-
tion implies that these tree fragments (which exclude
the detached subtrees) also correspond to translation
equivalents. The tree fragments that are obtained by
decomposing the synchronous trees in this fashion
are similar to the Synchronous Tree Insertion Gram-
mar of (Shieber and Schabes, 1990).
We developed a tree traversal algorithm that de-
composes parallel trees into all minimal tree frag-
ments. Given two synchronous trees and their node
alignment decomposition information, our tree frag-
ment extraction algorithm operates by an “in-order”
traversal of the trees top down, starting from the root
nodes. The traversal can be guided by either the
source or target parse tree. Each node in the tree
that is marked as an aligned node triggers a decom-
position. The subtree that is rooted at this node is
removed from the currently traversed tree. A copy
of the removed subtree is then recursively processed
for top-down decomposition. If the current tree node
being explored is not an aligned node (and thus is not
a decomposition point), the traversal continues down
the tree, possibly all the way to the leaves of the tree.
Decomposition is performed on the corresponding
parallel tree at the same time. We apply this pro-
cess on all the aligned constituent nodes (decompo-
sition points) to obtain all possible decomposed syn-
chronous tree fragment pairs from the original par-
allel parse trees. This results in a collection of all
minimal synchronous subtree fragments. These syn-
chronous subtree fragments are minimal in the sense
that they do not contain any internal aligned nodes.
Another property of the synchronous subtree frag-
ments is that their frontier nodes are either aligned
nodes from the original tree or leaf nodes (corre-
sponding to lexical items). Figure 3 shows some
sample tree fragment pairs that were obtained from
the example discussed earlier in Figure 1.

chronous context-free rules. This creates rules in a
format that is compatible with the Stat-XFER for-
malism that was described in Section 1. Our system
currently does not use the internal tree structure in-
formation that is contained in the synchronous tree
fragments. Therefore, only the syntactic category la-
bels of the roots of the tree fragments, and the nodes
on the fragment frontier are relevant to decoding.
This in essense corresponds to a “flattening” of the
synchronous tree fragment into a synchronous con-
text free style rule.
The flattening of the tree fragments is accom-
plished by an “in-order” traversal on each of the tree
fragments to produce a string representation. Fron-
tier nodes in the fragment are either labeled con-
stituent nodes or leaf nodes of the original parse tree.
These form the right-hand sides of the flattened rule.
The positions of the constituent nodes in the output
string are numbered to keep track of alignment of the
nodes, which is often non-monotonic due to reorder-
ing between the source and target languages. Finally
the root constituent label of the source tree fragment
becomes the source-side parent category of the rule,
while the root label of the target tree fragment be-
comes the target side parent category.
Accurate automatic transfer rule learning re-
quires accurate word alignments and parse struc-
tures. Thus, to favor high precision (at the expense
of some loss of recall), in our work to date on Chi-
nese and other languages, while we extract syntactic
phrases from all available parallel data, we extract

rules only from manually word-aligned parsed par-
allel data. To compensate for the limited amount of
data, we generalize the rules as much as possible.
Elements in the rules that originate from leaf nodes
in the parse trees are generalized to their part-of-
speech categories, if the corresponding words were
one-to-one aligned in the parallel sentences. Un-
aligned words and words that are part of one-to-
many alignments are not generalized to the POS
level and remain lexicalized in the final rule.
The phrase table extracted from the corpus and the
rules are scored together to ensure that they are con-
sistent when used in our translation system. For all
Stat-XFER experiments to date, we have used just
the source side conditionig with a constant smooth-
ing factor for robustness to noise.

6 Extraction Applied to Chinese-English
Parallel Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903964285714">
We used the pipeline of PFA node alignment fol-
lowed by rule extraction to build resources for a
Stat-XFER Chinese-to-English MT system. The
syntax-based phrase table was constructed from
two large parallel corpora released by LDC for the
DARPA/GALE program. The parallel sentences for
both English and Chinese were parsed using the
Stanford parser. The first corpus consists of about
1.2 million sentence pairs. Our extraction process
applied to this corpus resulted in a syntax-based
phrase table of about 9.2 million entries. The other
data source used was a parallel corpus of about 2.6
million sentences, but many of its entries were from
a Chinese-English lexicon. From this corpus, we ex-
tracted 8.75 million phrases.
Rule learning was performed on a 10K-sentence
parallel corpus that was manually word-aligned, re-
leased by LDC for the DARPA/GALE program.
This manually word-aligned corpus includes the par-
allel Chinese-English treebank of 3,343 sentence
pairs. The treebank sentences come with verified
correct parse trees for English and Chinese. The rest
of the 10K corpus was parsed by the Stanford parser.
The complete 10K parallel corpus was node aligned
and rules were extracted as described in Section 5.
Figure 3 shows two synchronous tree fragments that
were extracted from the example node-aligned sen-
tence pair in Figure 1. After generalization and flat-

tening, we obtain rules such as those shown in Fig-
ure 4. The above process resulted in a collection
of almost 100K rules. Some statistics on this rule
set are shown in Table 3. Analysis of this rule set
indicates that only about 4% of these rules were ob-
served more than once in the data. These include
the most general and useful rules for mapping Chi-
nese syntactic structures to their corresponding En-
glish structures. Most of the “singleton” rules are
highly lexicalized. A large portion of the singleton
rules are noisy rules, but many of them are good and
useful rules. Experiments indicate that removing all
singleton rules hurts translation performance.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948461538462">
The process described in this paper provides a fully
automated solution for extracting large collection
of reliable syntax-based phrase tables and syntac-
tic synchronous transfer rules from large volumes
of parsed parallel corpora. In conjunction with the
Stat-XFER syntax-based framework, this provides a
fully automated solution for building syntax-based
MT systems. The current performance of this ap-
proach still lags behind state-of-the-art phrase-based
systems when trained on the same parallel data but is
showing encouraging improvements. Furthermore,
the resources extracted by our process can be used
by various other syntax-based MT approaches.

The input to the process is a corpus of parallel sentences, word-aligned and annotated with phrase-structure parse trees. We first apply a newly developed algorithm for aligning parse-tree nodes between the two parallel trees. Next, we extract all aligned sub-sentential syntactic constituents from the parallel sentences, and create a syntax-based phrase-table. Finally, we treat the node alignments as tree decomposition points and extract from the corpus all possible synchronous parallel tree fragments.

(Samuelsson and Volk, 2007) describe a process for manual alignment of nodes in parallel trees. This approach is well suited for generating reliable parallel treebanks, but is impractical for accumulating resources from large parallel data. (Tinsley et al., 2007) use statistical lexicons derived from automatic statistical word alignment for aligning nodes in parallel trees. In our approach, we use the word alignment information directly, which we believe may be more reliable than the statistical lexicon. (Groves et al., 2004) propose a method of aligning nodes between parallel trees automatically, based on word alignments. In addition to the word alignment information, their approach uses the constituent labels of nodes in the trees, and the general structure of the tree. Our approach is more general in the sense that we only consider the word alignments, thereby making the approach applicable to any parser or phrasestructure representation, even ones that are quite different for the two languages involved. 88 2.3 Unaligned Words and Contiguity Word-level alignment of phrase-level translation equivalents often lea</context>

We first apply a newly developed algorithm for aligning parse-tree nodes between the two parallel trees. Next, we extract all aligned sub-sentential syntactic constituents from the parallel sentences, and create a syntax-based phrase-table. Finally, we treat the node alignments as tree decomposition points and extract from the corpus all possible synchronous parallel tree fragments. These are then converted into synchronous context-free rules. We describe the approach and analyze its application to Chinese-English parallel data. 1 Introduction Phrase-based Statistical MT (PB-SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) has become the predominant approach to Machine Translation in recent years. PB-SMT requires broad-coverage databases of phrase-to-phrase translation equivalents. These are commonly acquired from large volumes of automatically wordaligned sentence-parallel text corpora. Accurate identification of sub-sentential translation equivalents, however, is a critical process in all data-driven MT approaches, including a variety of data-driven syntax-based approaches that have been developed in recent years. (Chiang, 2005) (Imamura et al., 2004) (Galley et al., 2004). 87 In this paper, we describe a mul</context>

The Stat-XFER framework also includes a fullyimplemented transfer engine that applies the transfer grammar to a source-language input sentence at runtime, and produces collections of scored word and phrase-level translations according to the grammar. These are collected into a lattice data-structure. Scores are based on a log-linear combination of several features, and a beam-search controls the underlying parsing and transfer process. A secondstage monotonic decoder is responsible for combining translation fragments into complete translation hypotheses (Lavie, 2008) 2 PFA Algorithm for Node Aligment 2.1 Objectives of the Algorithm Our objective of the first stage of our approach is to detect sub-sentential constituent correspondences in parallel sentences, based on phrase-structure parses for the two corresponding sentences. Given a pair of parallel sentences and their corresponding parse trees, our goal is to find pairings of nodes in the source and target trees whose yields are translation equivalents of each other. Our current approach only considers complete constituents and their contigious yields, and will therefore not align discontiguous phrases </context>

Since the subtrees are rooted at aligned nodes, their yields are translation equivalents of each other. The other synchronous tree fragment pair consists of the remaining portions of the trees. The translation equivalence of the complete tree (or subtree) prior to decomposition implies that these tree fragments (which exclude the detached subtrees) also correspond to translation equivalents. The tree fragments that are obtained by decomposing the synchronous trees in this fashion are similar to the Synchronous Tree Insertion Grammar of (Shieber and Schabes, 1990). We developed a tree traversal algorithm that decomposes parallel trees into all minimal tree fragments. Given two synchronous trees and their node alignment decomposition information, our tree fragment extraction algorithm operates by an “in-order” traversal of the trees top down, starting from the root nodes. The traversal can be guided by either the source or target parse tree. Each node in the tree that is marked as an aligned node triggers a decomposition. The subtree that is rooted at this node is removed from the currently traversed tree. A copy of the removed subtree is then recursive</context>
