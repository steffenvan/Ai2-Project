<bodyText confidence="0.999857318181818">
We present in this paper a series of
induced methods to assign domain tags to
WordNet entries. Our prime objective is
to enrich the contextual information in
WordNet specific to each synset entry. By
using the available lexical sources such as
Far East Dictionary and the contextual
information in WordNet itself, we can
find a foundation upon which we can base
our categorization. Next we further
examine the similarity between common
lexical taxonomy and the semantic
hierarchy of WordNet. Based on this
observation and the knowledge of other
semantic relations we enlarge the
coverage of our findings in a systematic
way. Evaluation of the results shows that
we achieved reasonable and satisfactory
accuracy. We propose this as the first step
of wordnet expansion into a bona fide
semantic network linked to real-world
knowledge.

organization is based on different semantic
relations among the words. Entries (or lemas)
sharing the same meaning is grouped into a synset
and assigned with a unique sense identification
number for easy retrieval and tracking purposes.
This unique offset number gives the information
about the parts of speech and the hierarchy
position to which a specific synset belongs. For
nouns and verbs the synsets are grouped into
multiple lexical hierarchies; modifiers such as
adjectives and adverbs are simply “organized into
clusters on the basis of binary opposition
(antinomy).” [1] This lexical hierarchy makes the
lexical domain assigning task more
straightforward because it coincides with a
ontological taxonomy in many aspects. The
primary objective of our project is to enrich the
WordNet knowledge content due to the fact that
“WordNet lacks relations between related
concepts.” [2] We adopt WordNet itself, together
with other lexical resources to develop an
integrated domain specific lexical resource.

1. The Five Tagging Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857">
Starting with two lexical resources, we
employed five steps to assign and expand domain
tags. Basically, the explicit domain information
from Far East Dictionary as well as WordNet&apos;s
own hierarchy of semantic relation are used to
extend the coverage of domain - assignment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.481952">
1.1 Domain Data Lookup from Far East
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945818083333333">
Dictionary
The digital file of Far East Dictionary
contains complete information for each word
entry that can be found in an ordinary printed
version. Most of all, it lists the domain
information for each vocabulary wherever
possible. Thus we employ the available data from
a text source file (each vocabulary entry is
organized as one single row) and extract all the
information by running a string manipulation
program coded in Visual Basic. During the
extraction process we only take into account the
part of speech of each word in Far East Dictionary.
Next, we map the domains obtained from Far East
Dictionary if the word and its part of speech
coincides with the entries in our database which
contains a complete list of synset. Since
WordNet collects only nouns, verbs, adjectives
and adverbs, we only extract the domain data that
falls into these four categories. Later we group
the information in a database table and extent the
assigned domains of each word to its synset.
Table 1 is an example of our database table which
&apos;contains all the adverbial uses of `aback.&apos;

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874444444445">
In Table 1, it is shown that &apos;aback&apos; has two
adverbial senses. Since in Far East Dictionary
“aback” is labeled with domain &apos;aviation,&apos; extra
work of expansion is necessary to further label all
of its adverb synset with the same domain to
maintain the integrity of the information. Because
both the extraction and expansion method would
produce ambiguities in domain assignment,
manual verifications are required in the future.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9872385">
1.2 Extracting Domain Information from
WordNet Sense Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95109193442623">
Each WordNet entry (i.e. each synset) is
followed by its sense. Although there is no
specifically defined set of controlled vocabulary,
the sense definition does specify the field the
synset members are commonly used in that
specific field of study, such as biology, physics or
chemistry. This specification comes in a special
format contained in a bracket for each WordNet
entry so that extraction of data is possible and
straightforward. Due to the fact that each domain
is directly extracted by its corresponding synset,
there is simply no ambiguity in assigning the
domain tags. And if there is more than one lexical
item in that synset, all will share the same domain
tag.
1.3 Establishment of a Common Domain
Taxonomy for Nouns
Each lexical resource uses a different domain
taxonomy, which may be explicitly defined or
implicitly assumed. Hence, when combining
domain information from multiple sources, the
establishment of a Common Domain Taxonomy
(CDT) is crucial for both efficient representation
as well as effective knowledge merging. Our
survey of existing domain taxonomy, including
LDOCE, HowNet, Tongyici Cilin, etc., show that
there is quite a lot in common. Hence we decide to
build a working CDT based on the two resources
we have. Note that since our goal is to establish a
domain taxonomy for wordnets (for English now
and for Chinese in the future), the existing domain
information in WordNet need to be assumed as
defaults that can be over-ridden. Hence a model of
CDT based on basic binary combination
involving WordNet is necessary.
After collecting all the domain tags from the
two resources, we build our CDT. First, all
common domain nodes are put in a hierarchy
based on their relation. Second, inconsistent
domain names are resolved. Last, when gaps
appear after all domain tags are attached to the
taxonomy, new domain categories are adopted to
fill in the gaps and make a more complete CDT.
Since top taxonomy presupposes a particular view
on conceptual primacy and may differ in different
lexical sources, we took a bottom-up approach to
our CDT. That is, right now each taxonomy tree
now stops at some broad-consensus level without
being committed to a higher taxonomy. The
following is a partial list of our current CDT.

WordNet has is a lexical semantic hierarchy
linking all synsets with lexical semantic relations.
We convert all the relations to a database in a
relational table, as shown in Table 2 [1]:
Table 2 Lexical Relation Table
The relation symbols in Table 2 are adopted from
the WordNet database files. These symbols are
saved with each synset entry to indicate a specific
semantic relation with other synsets. The
implemented information allows us to trace and
locate all the related synsets.
...
Please note that by induction and actual
examples from the lexical organization in
WordNet, it is found that a hyponym is very likely
to belong to the same domain as its hypernym.
Similar results are also found for wordnet based
cross-lingual inference of lexical semantic
relations [4]. For instance, under the term
&apos;mathematics,&apos; all the hyponyms below are related
to this field of study. To make us of this lexical
semantic phenomenon, we make a table of all the
domain terms and map them to their unique
WordNet sense identification number. Later we
use the tree expansion method (discussed in more
detail in Section 2.4) to trace down all the
hyponyms. For example, by using this method,
the hyponyms of Linguistics are all labeled as
&apos;linguistics&apos; and so forth.

This form of data presentation makes inspection
and observation on the hierarchy among nouns
more straightforward. After careful and
systematic examination, domain assignment is
trickled down to each synset level by level. The
same task is performed up to the fifth level. A tree
traversal program is executed to trace down the
hyponyms and assign domain-tag based on its
hypernyms.

of Speech
The hierarchy expansion method based on
taxonomy mainly applies to nouns. For modifiers
such as adjectives and adverbs this general
observation does not produce a satisfactory result
since “[t]he semantic organization of modifiers in
WordNet is unlike...the tree structures created by
hyponymy for nouns or troponymy for verbs.” [1]
However since adverbs/adjectives are often
morphologically derived from other major
categories, such information can be used to infer
domain classification. For example, the adjective
&apos;stellar&apos; is derived directly from the noun &apos;star.&apos;
The term, &apos;star&apos; is mostly mentioned in an
astronomical context. Based on this relation,
since &apos;star&apos; is labeled with &apos;astronomy&apos; based on
Lexical Hierarchy, the adjective &apos;stellar&apos; can be
assigned with the same domain. We combine the
tables on the left side and right side of Table 2
Lexical Relation Table to obtain a table organized
as follows:

Later the recordsets that have the relation symbol

are extracted and these derived adjectives and
adverbs are further assigned with the same
domain as the nouns they are derived from.

method should be considered as the best approach,
with 92.50% accuracy. This direct information
extraction method from WordNet itself does not
attain 100% is due to the fact that only certain
words in one synset are used in specialized area of
studies. For example, in the study of botany, there
are a number of terms which indicate the same
species, however, only a certain words are the
actual scientific names while the rest are merely
common names. In our project, our primary

Based on the extent of domain assignment
and the amount of entries covered, Tree
Expansion is the most ideal method, with 51.15 %
coverage. Both WordNet and Tree Expansion
methods have their own disadvantages and
advantages, such as time consumption and the
extent of coverage. In terms of the WordNet
method, extracting data directly from the digital
sources is very efficient and the result is more
reliable. With high accuracy, the revision that
may follow later on in the future would be more
straightforward. However, in terms of the extent
of coverage, Tree Expansion is still a more
effective method. Its result is very encouraging
because it contributes to over 51% among the
entire domain assignment, with a total of 74%
correct or acceptable rate. However, it is worth
noticing that for all the entries in WordNet, not
every single entry is supposed to be grouped or
defined within a specific domain. For instance,
all the common grammatical words (a, the, is, etc.)
and the high frequency words (hit, kick, smile,
etc.) would not and should not belong to a special
domain. Although we do not have a realistic
measure for recall, the slightly less than 49%
coverage of all senses is quite acceptable. So far
the number of distinct entries that have been
tagged is 103,709, which covers up to 59.62 % of
the whole 173,942 word and sense pairs.

2 Future Goals and Improvements
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963342857143">
At present our domain tag assignment is still
at a preliminary stage, which requires further
modifications and improvements. Other method
such as bottom up tree traversal is more likely to
give rise to a better result with higher accuracy.
For example, for a hyponym which falls into the
domain of botany, the hypernym is very likely to
belong to the domain “biology.” Extracting
sources from a large corpora grouped by topics is
also a reliable approach. For instance, in a journal
related to the study in physics, most of the special
field-related terms are likely to appear more
frequently than in other ordinary sources. Other
than extracting information from WordNet itself,
other thesauruses in digital files can be taken into
consideration as well.
There are a significant number of possible
applications that can be contributed by domain tag
assignment. Due to the fact that English WordNet
is the most fundamental structure upon which a
wordnet in other language is based, assigning
domain tags to WordNet itself can indeed be
expanded to other inter-linked wordnets such as
EuroWordNet. By categorizing lexicon into
groups of different domains, it will benefit the
study of computational linguistics: “word sense
disambiguation methods could profit from these
richer ontologies, and improve word sense
disambiguation performance.” [2] Last, but not
the least, domain tagging is can be the first
realistic step of enriching the linguistic ontology
of wordnets so that they can be linked to
real-world knowledge and serve as bona fide
semantic network for general purpose knowledge
processing.

<abstract confidence="0.998252662420382">We present in this paper a series of induced methods to assign domain tags to WordNet entries. Our prime objective is to enrich the contextual information in WordNet specific to each synset entry. By using the available lexical sources such as Far East Dictionary and the contextual information in WordNet itself, we can find a foundation upon which we can base our categorization. Next we further examine the similarity between common lexical taxonomy and the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. Based on this observation and the knowledge of other semantic relations we enlarge the coverage of our findings in a systematic way. Evaluation of the results shows that we achieved reasonable and satisfactory accuracy. We propose this as the first step of wordnet expansion into a bona fide semantic network linked to real-world knowledge. WordNet is a lexicon comprising of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Its basic 1 This research is partially funded by an IDLP project grant from the National Science Council of Taiwan, ROC. Work reported in this paper was carried out in summer 2001, during Chang&apos;s internship at Academia Sinica. We are indebted to two anonymous reviewers of SemaNet 2002, as well as from the First International WordNet Conference for their helpful comments. An earlier version of this paper was accepted by the first IWC but was not presented because of the authors&apos; travelling difficulties at that time. We thank colleagues at Academia Sinica, especially Shu-Chuan Tseng, Keh-jiann Chen, and members of the WordNet group, for their input and help. organization is based on different semantic relations among the words. Entries (or lemas) sharing the same meaning is grouped into a synset and assigned with a unique sense identification number for easy retrieval and tracking purposes. This unique offset number gives the information about the parts of speech and the hierarchy position to which a specific synset belongs. For nouns and verbs the synsets are grouped into multiple lexical hierarchies; modifiers such as adjectives and adverbs are simply “organized into clusters on the basis of binary opposition (antinomy).” [1] This lexical hierarchy makes the lexical domain assigning task more straightforward because it coincides with a ontological taxonomy in many aspects. The primary objective of our project is to enrich the WordNet knowledge content due to the fact that “WordNet lacks relations between related concepts.” [2] We adopt WordNet itself, together with other lexical resources to develop an integrated domain specific lexical resource. 1. The Five Tagging Methods Starting with two lexical resources, we employed five steps to assign and expand domain tags. Basically, the explicit domain information from Far East Dictionary as well as WordNet&apos;s own hierarchy of semantic relation are used to extend the coverage of domain assignment. 1.1 Domain Data Lookup from Far East Dictionary The digital file of Far East Dictionary contains complete information for each word entry that can be found in an ordinary printed version. Most of all, it lists the domain information for each vocabulary wherever possible. Thus we employ the available data from a text source file (each vocabulary entry is organized as one single row) and extract all the information by running a string manipulation program coded in Visual Basic. During the extraction process we only take into account the part of speech of each word in Far East Dictionary. Next, we map the domains obtained from Far East Dictionary if the word and its part of speech coincides with the entries in our database which contains a complete list of synset. WordNet collects only nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, we only extract the domain data that falls into these four categories. Later we group the information in a database table and extent the assigned domains of each word to its synset. Table 1 is an example of our database table which &apos;contains all the adverbial uses of `aback.&apos; id term domain 00073303R aback aviation, 00073386R aback aviation, Table 1 Example of The Far East Domain Database Table In Table 1, it is shown that &apos;aback&apos; has two adverbial senses. Since in Far East Dictionary “aback” is labeled with domain &apos;aviation,&apos; extra work of expansion is necessary to further label all of its adverb synset with the same domain to maintain the integrity of the information. Because both the extraction and expansion method would produce ambiguities in domain assignment, manual verifications are required in the future. 1.2 Extracting Domain Information from WordNet Sense Description Each WordNet entry (i.e. each synset) is followed by its sense. Although there is no specifically defined set of controlled vocabulary, the sense definition does specify the field the synset members are commonly used in that specific field of study, such as biology, physics or chemistry. This specification comes in a special format contained in a bracket for each WordNet entry so that extraction of data is possible and straightforward. Due to the fact that each domain is directly extracted by its corresponding synset, there is simply no ambiguity in assigning the domain tags. And if there is more than one lexical item in that synset, all will share the same domain tag. 1.3 Establishment of a Common Domain Taxonomy for Nouns Each lexical resource uses a different domain taxonomy, which may be explicitly defined or implicitly assumed. Hence, when combining domain information from multiple sources, the establishment of a Common Domain Taxonomy (CDT) is crucial for both efficient representation as well as effective knowledge merging. Our survey of existing domain taxonomy, including LDOCE, HowNet, Tongyici Cilin, etc., show that there is quite a lot in common. Hence we decide to build a working CDT based on the two resources we have. Note that since our goal is to establish a domain taxonomy for wordnets (for English now and for Chinese in the future), the existing domain information in WordNet need to be assumed as defaults that can be over-ridden. Hence a model of CDT based on basic binary combination involving WordNet is necessary. After collecting all the domain tags from the two resources, we build our CDT. First, all common domain nodes are put in a hierarchy based on their relation. Second, inconsistent domain names are resolved. Last, when gaps appear after all domain tags are attached to the taxonomy, new domain categories are adopted to fill in the gaps and make a more complete CDT. Since top taxonomy presupposes a particular view on conceptual primacy and may differ in different lexical sources, we took a bottom-up approach to our CDT. That is, right now each taxonomy tree now stops at some broad-consensus level without being committed to a higher taxonomy. The following is a partial list of our current CDT.</abstract>

Example of Tree Expansion for Nouns This form of data presentation makes inspection and observation on the hierarchy among nouns more straightforward. After careful and systematic examination, domain assignment is trickled down to each synset level by level. The same task is performed up to the fifth level. A tree traversal program is executed to trace down the hyponyms and assign domain-tag based on its hypernyms. 1.5 Relational Expansion of Other Parts of Speech The hierarchy expansion method based on taxonomy mainly applies to nouns. For modifiers such as adjectives and adverbs this general observation does not produce a satisfactory result since “[t]he semantic organization of modifiers in WordNet is unlike...the tree structures created by hyponymy for nouns or troponymy for verbs.” [1] However since adverbs/adjectives are often morphologically derived from other major categories, such information can be used to infer domain classification. For example, the adjective &apos;stellar&apos; is derived directly from the noun &apos;star.&apos; The term, &apos;star&apos; is mostly mentioned in an astronomical context. Based on this relation, since &apos;star&apos; is labeled with &apos;astronomy&apos; based on Lexical Hierarchy, the adjective &apos;stellar&apos; can be assigned with the same domain. We combine the tables on the left side and right side of Table 2 Lexical Relation Table to obtain a table organized as follows: morpho-lo Un-tagged gical Adj/Adv Relation ID Figure 2. JOIN Method Later the recordsets that have the relation symbol as “\”(denoted “derived from,” refer to Table 2) are extracted and these derived adjectives and adverbs are further assigned with the same domain as the nouns they are derived from.

As shown in Figure 7 the tagging entries may overlap. In terms of the accuracy, 2.2 WordNet method should be considered as the best approach, with 92.50% accuracy. This direct information extraction method from WordNet itself does not attain 100% is due to the fact that only certain words in one synset are used in specialized area of studies. For example, in the study of botany, there are a number of terms which indicate the same species, however, only a certain words are the actual scientific names while the rest are merely common names. In our project, our primary objective is to favour the words that belong to the specific area of studies, which is also the main concept upon which our lexical taxonomy is organized.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.995908515151515">Figure 7. Domain-Tagging Coverage vs. Methods Based on the extent of domain assignment and the amount of entries covered, Tree Expansion is the most ideal method, with 51.15 % coverage. Both WordNet and Tree Expansion methods have their own disadvantages and advantages, such as time consumption and the extent of coverage. In terms of the WordNet method, extracting data directly from the digital sources is very efficient and the result is more reliable. With high accuracy, the revision that may follow later on in the future would be more straightforward. However, in terms of the extent of coverage, Tree Expansion is still a more effective method. Its result is very encouraging because it contributes to over 51% among the entire domain assignment, with a total of 74% correct or acceptable rate. However, it is worth noticing that for all the entries in WordNet, not every single entry is supposed to be grouped or defined within a specific domain. For instance, all the common grammatical words (a, the, is, etc.) and the high frequency words (hit, kick, smile, etc.) would not and should not belong to a special domain. Although we do not have a realistic measure for recall, the slightly less than 49% coverage of all senses is quite acceptable. So far the number of distinct entries that have been tagged is 103,709, which covers up to 59.62 % of the whole 173,942 word and sense pairs. Goals and Improvements At present our domain tag assignment is still at a preliminary stage, which requires further modifications and improvements. Other method such as bottom up tree traversal is more likely to give rise to a better result with higher accuracy. For example, for a hyponym which falls into the domain of botany, the hypernym is very likely to belong to the domain “biology.” Extracting sources from a large corpora grouped by topics is also a reliable approach. For instance, in a journal related to the study in physics, most of the special field-related terms are likely to appear more frequently than in other ordinary sources. Other than extracting information from WordNet itself, other thesauruses in digital files can be taken into consideration as well. There are a significant number of possible applications that can be contributed by domain tag assignment. Due to the fact that English WordNet is the most fundamental structure upon which a wordnet in other language is based, assigning domain tags to WordNet itself can indeed be expanded to other inter-linked wordnets such as EuroWordNet. By categorizing lexicon into groups of different domains, it will benefit the study of computational linguistics: “word sense disambiguation methods could profit from these richer ontologies, and improve word sense disambiguation performance.” [2] Last, but not the least, domain tagging is can be the first realistic step of enriching the linguistic ontology of wordnets so that they can be linked to real-world knowledge and serve as bona fide semantic network for general purpose knowledge processing.</abstract>
