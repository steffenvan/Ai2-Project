This paper describes the mutually benefi-
cial relationship between a cultural heritage
digital library and a historical treebank: an
established digital library can provide the
resources and structure necessary for effi-
ciently building a treebank, while a tree-
bank, as a language resource, is a valuable
tool for audiences traditionally served by
such libraries.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940357142857">
The composition of historical treebanks is funda-
mentally different from that of modern ones. While
modern treebanks are generally comprised of news-
paper articles,1 historical treebanks are built from
texts that have been the focus of study for centuries,
if not millennia. The Penn-Helsinki Parsed Cor-
pus of Middle English (Kroch and Taylor, 2000),
for example, includes Chaucer’s 14th-century Par-
son’s Tale, while the York Poetry Corpus (Pintzuk
and Leendert, 2001) includes the entire text of Be-
owulf. The scholarship that has attended these texts
since their writing has produced a wealth of contex-
tual materials, including commentaries, translations,
and linguistic resources.

<footnote confidence="0.725034125">
1To name just three, the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994)
is comprised of texts from the Wall Street Journal; the Ger-
man TIGER Treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is built from texts
taken from the Frankfurter Rundschau; and the Prague De-
pendency Treebank (Hajiˇc, 1998) includes articles from sev-
eral daily newspapers (Lidov´e noviny and Mlad´a fronta Dnes), a
business magazine (ˇCeskomoravsk´y Profit) and a scientific jour-
nal (Vesmir).

For the past twenty years, the Perseus digital li-
brary (Crane, 1987; Crane et al., 2001) has collected
materials of this sort to create an open reading envi-
ronment for the study of Classical texts. This envi-
ronment presents the Greek or Latin source text and
contextualizes it with secondary publications (e.g.,
translations, commentaries, references in dictionar-
ies), along with a morphological analysis of every
word in the text and variant manuscript readings as
well (when available).
We have recently begun work on syntactically an-
notating the texts in our collection to create a Latin
Dependency Treebank. In the course of developing
this treebank, the resources already invested in the
digital library have been crucial: the digital library
provides a modular structure on which to build addi-
tional services, contains a large corpus of Classical
source texts, and provides a wealth of contextual in-
formation for annotators who are non-native speak-
ers of the language.
In this the digital library has had a profound im-
pact on the creation of our treebank, but the influ-
ence goes both ways. The digital library is a heav-
ily trafficked website with a wide range of users, in-
cluding professional scholars, students and hobby-
ists. By incorporating the treebank as a language
resource into this digital library, we have the poten-
tial to introduce a fundamental NLP tool to an audi-
ence outside the traditional disciplines of computer
science or computational linguistics that would nor-
mally use it. Students of the language can profit
from the syntactic information encoded in a tree-
bank, while traditional scholars can benefit from the
textual searching it makes possible as well.

verb armo and the noun arma), and gives a full mor-

for a word given its surrounding context, and users
can also vote for the form they think is correct.2

is also annotated with the lemma from which it is
inflected and its morphological code. We plan to re-
lease the treebank incrementally with each new ma-
jor textual addition (so that version 1.4, for instance,
will include the treebank of 1.3 plus Sallust’s Bellum
Catilinae, the text currently in production).

4 The Influence of a Digital Library
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999444">
A cultural heritage digital library has provided a fer-
tile ground for our historical treebank in two funda-
mental ways: by providing a structure on which to
build new services and by providing reading support
to expedite the process of annotation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995169">
4.1 Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998415625">
By anchoring the treebank in a cultural heritage dig-
ital library, we are able to take advantage of a struc-
tured reading environment with canonical standards
for the presentation of text and a large body of dig-
itized resources, which include XML source texts,
morphological analyzers, machine-readable dictio-
naries, and an online user interface.
Texts. Our digital library contains 3.4 million
words of Latin source texts (along with 4.9 mil-
lion words of Greek). The texts are all public-
domain materials that have been scanned, OCR’d
and formatted into TEI-compliant XML. The value
of this prior labor is twofold: most immediately,
the existence of clean, digital editions of these
texts has saved us a considerable amount of time
and resources, as we would otherwise have to
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.8328535">
3We are also collaborating with other Latin treebanks (no-
tably the Index Thomisticus on the works of Thomas Aquinas)
to create a common set of annotation guidelines to be used as a
standard for Latin of any period (Bamman et al., 2007).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894489361702">
create them before annotating them syntactically;
but their encoding as repurposeable XML docu-
ments in a larger library also allows us to refer
to them under standardized citations. The pas-
sage of Vergil displayed in Figure 1 is not simply
a string of unstructured text; it is a subdocument
(Book=1:card=1) that is itself part of a larger doc-
ument object (Perseus:text:1999.02.0055), with sis-
ters (Book=1:card=8) and children of its own (e.g.,
line=4). This XML structure allows us to situate any
given treebank sentence within its larger context.
Morphological Analysis. As a highly inflected
language, Latin has an intricate morphological sys-
tem, in which a full morphological analysis is the
product of nine features: part of speech, person,
number, tense, mood, voice, gender, case and de-
gree. Our digital library has included a morphologi-
cal analyzer from its beginning. This resource maps
an inflected form of a word (such as arma above)
to all of the possible analyses for all of the dictio-
nary entries associated with it. In addition to provid-
ing a common morphological standard, this mapping
greatly helps to constrain the problem of morpho-
logical tagging (selecting the correct form from all
possible forms), since a statistical tagger only needs
to consider the morphological analyses licensed by
the inflection rather than all possible combinations.
User interface. The user interface of our library
is designed to be modular, since different texts have
different contextual resources associated with them
(while some have translations, others may have
commentaries). This modularity allows us to easily
introduce new features, since the underlying archi-
tecture of the page doesn’t change – a new feature
can simply be added.
Figure 2 presents a screenshot of the digital li-
brary with an annotation tool built into the inter-
face. In the widget on the right, the source text in
view (the first chunk of Tacitus’ Annales) has been
automatically segmented into sentences; an annota-
tor can click on any sentence to assign it a syntac-
tic annotation. Here the user has clicked on the first
sentence (Vrbem Romam a principio reges habuere);
this action brings up an annotation screen in which
a partial automatic parse is provided, along with the
most likely morphological analysis for each word.
The annotator can then correct this automatic output

and move on to the next segmented sentence, with
all of the contextual resources still in view.

4.2 Reading support
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987076923077">
Modern treebanks also differ from historical ones in
the fluency of their annotators. The efficient anno-
tation of historical languages is hindered by the fact
that no native speakers exist, and this is especially
true of Latin, a difficult language with a high de-
gree of non-projectivity. While the Penn Treebank
can report a productivity rate of between 750 and
1000 words per hour for their annotators after four
months of training (Taylor et al., 2003) and the Penn
Chinese treebank can report a rate of 240-480 words
per hour (Chiou et al., 2001), our annotation speeds
are significantly slower, ranging from 90 words per
hour to 281. Our best approach for Latin is to de-
velop strategies that can speed up the annotation pro-
cess, and here the resources found in a digital library
are crucial. There are three varieties of contextual
resources in our digital library that aid in the un-
derstanding of a text: translations, commentaries,
and dictionaries. These resources shed light on a
text, from the level of sentences to that of individual
words.
Translations. Translations provide reading sup-
port on a large scale: while loose translations may
not be able to inform readers about the meaning and
syntactic role of any single word, they do provide
a broad description of the action taking place, and
this can often help to establish the semantic struc-
ture of the sentence – who did what to whom, and
how. In a language with a free word order (and with
poetry especially), this kind of high-level structure
can be important for establishing a quick initial un-
derstanding of the sentence before narrowing down
to individual syntactic roles.
Commentaries. Classical commentaries provide
information about the specific use of individ-
ual words, often noting morphological information
(such as case) for ambiguous words or giving ex-
planatory information for unusual structures. This
information often comes at crucial decision points

in the annotation process, and represents judgments
by authorities in the field with expertise in that par-
ticular text.

Machine-Readable Dictionaries. In addition to
providing lists of stems for morphological analyzers,
machine-readable dictionaries also provide valuable
reading support for the process of lemma selection.
Every available morphological analysis for a word is
paired with the word stem (a lemma) from which it is
derived, but analyses are often ambiguous between
different lemmas. The extremely common form est,
for example, is a third person singular present in-
dicative active verb, but can be inflected from two
different lemmas: the verb sum (to be) and the verb
edo (to eat). In this case, we can use the text already
tagged to suggest a more probable form (sum ap-
pears much more frequently and is therefore the like-
lier candidate), but in less dominant cases, we can
use the dictionary: since the word stems involved
in morphological analysis have been derived from
the dictionary lemmas, we can map each analysis
to a dictionary definition, so that, for instance, if an
annotator is unfamiliar with the distinction between
the lemmas occido1 (to strike down) and occido2 (to
fall), their respective definitions can clarify it.
Machine-readable dictionaries, however, are also
a valuable annotation resource in that they often pro-
vide exemplary syntactic information as part of their
definitions. Consider, for example, the following
line from Book 6, line 2 of Vergil’s Aeneid: et tan-
dem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris (“and at last
it glides to the Euboean shores of Cumae”). The
noun oris (shores) here is technically ambiguous,
and can be derived from a single lemma (ora) as a
noun in either the dative or ablative case. The dic-
tionary definition of allabor (to glide), however, dis-
ambiguates this for us, since it notes that the verb is
often constructed with either the dative or the ac-
cusative case.

<bodyText confidence="0.9966142">
Every word in our digital library is linked to a list
of its possible morphological analyses, and each of
those analyses is linked to its respective dictionary
entry. The place of a treebank in a digital library
allows for this tight level of integration.

5 The Impact of a Historical Treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
The traffic in our library currently exceeds 10 mil-
lion page views by 400,000 distinct users per month
(as approximated by unique IP addresses). These
users are not computational linguists or computer
scientists who would typically make use of a tree-
bank; they are a mix of Classical scholars, stu-
dents, and amateurs. These different audiences have
equally different uses for a large corpus of syntacti-
cally annotated sentences: for one group it can pro-
vide additional reading support, and for the other a
scholarly resource to be queried.

Our digital library is predominantly a reading en-
vironment: source texts in Greek and Latin are
presented with attendant materials to help facilitate
their understanding. The broadest of these materials
are translations, which present sentence-level equiv-
alents of the original; commentaries provide a more
detailed analysis of individual words and phrases. A

treebank has the potential to be a valuable contex-
tual resource by providing syntactic information for
every word in a sentence, not simply those chosen
by a commentator for discussion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981153">
5.2 Treebank as a Scholarly Resource
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983333333334">
For Classical scholars, a treebank can also be used
as a scholarly resource. Not all Classicists are pro-
grammers, however, and many of those who would
like to use such a resource would profit little from
an XML source file. We have already released ver-
sion 1.3 of the Latin Dependency Treebank in its
XML source, but we also plan to incorporate it into
the digital library as an object to be queried. This
will yield a powerful range of search options, in-
cluding lemmatized and morpho-syntactic search-
ing, and will be especially valuable for research in-
volving lexicography and semantic classification.
Lemmatized searching. The ability to conduct a
lemma-based textual search has long been a desider-
atum in Classics,4 where any given Latin word form
has 3.1 possible analyses on average.5 Locating all
inflections of edo (to eat) in the texts of Caesar, for
example, would involve two things:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8245307">
1. Searching for all possible inflections of the root
word. This amounts to 202 different word
forms attested in our texts (including com-
pounds with enclitics).
2. Eliminating all results that are homonyms de-
rived from a different lemma. Since several in-
flections of edo are homonyms with inflections
of the far more common sum (to be), many
of the found results will be false positives and
have to be discarded.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969351333333333">
This is a laborious process and, as such, is rarely
undertaken by Classical scholars: the lack of such
a resource has constrained the set of questions we

4Both the Perseus Project and the Thesaurus Linguae Grae-
cae (http://www.tlg.uci.edu) allow users to search for all in-

flected forms of a lemma in their texts, but neither filters results
that are homonyms derived from different lemmas.
5Based on the average number of lemma + morphology
combinations for all unique word tokens in our 3.4 million word
corpus. The word form amor, for example, has 3 analyses: as
a first-person singular present indicative passive verb derived
from the lemma amo (to love) and as either a nominative or
vocative masculine singular noun derived from amor (love).
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.995736545454545">
can ask about a text. Since a treebank encodes each
word’s lemma in addition to its morphological and
syntactic analysis, this information is now free for
the taking.
Morpho-syntactic searching. A treebank’s major
contribution to scholarship is that it encodes the
syntax of a sentence, along with a morphological
analysis of each word. These two together can be
combined into elaborate searches. Treebanks allow
scholars to find all instances of any particular con-
struction. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.777910428571429">
• When the conjunction cum is the head of a sub-
ordinate clause whose verb is indicative, it is
often recognized as a temporal clause, qualify-
ing the time of the main clause’s action;
• When that verb is subjunctive, however, the
clause retains a different meaning, as either cir-
cumstantial, causal, or adversative.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897625">
These different clause types can be found by
querying the treebank: in the first case, by search-
ing for indicative verbs that syntactically depend on
cum; in the second, for subjunctive verbs that de-
pend on it. In version 1.3 of the Latin Dependency
Treebank, cum is the head of a subordinate clause
38 times: in 7 of these clauses an indicative verb de-
pends on it, while in 31 of them a subjunctive one
does. This type of searching allows us to gather sta-
tistical data while also locating all instances for fur-
ther qualitative analysis.6
Lexicography. Searching for a combination of
lemma and morpho-syntactic information can yield
powerful results, which we can illustrate with a
question from Latin lexicography: how does the
meaning of a word change across authors and over
time? If we take a single verb – libero (to free, lib-
erate) – we can chart its use in various authors by
asking a more specific question: what do different
Latin authors want to be liberated from? We can
imagine that an orator of the republic has little need
to speak of liberation from eternal death, while an
apostolic father is just as unlikely to speak of being
freed from another’s monetary debt.
</bodyText>

syntactic research in Latin rhetoric and historical linguistics, see

</footnote>
<page confidence="0.998909">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.989228648148148">
We can answer this more general question by
transforming it into a syntactic one: what are the
most common complements of the lemma libero that
are expressed in oblique cases (e.g., ablative, geni-
tive, etc.) or as prepositional phrases? In a small test
of 100 instances of the lemma in Cicero and Jerome,
we find an interesting answer, presented in Table 2.
Cicero Jerome
periculo 14 manu 22
metu 8 morte 3
cura 6 ore 3
aere 3 latronibus 2
scelere 3 inimico 2
suspicione 3 bello 2
Table 2: Count of objects liberated from in Cicero
and Jerome that occur with frequency greater than 1
in a corpus of 100 sentences from each author con-
taining any inflected form of the verb libero.
The most common entities that Cicero speaks
of being liberated from clearly reflect the cares of
an orator of the republic: periculo (danger), metu
(fear), cura (care), and aere (debt). Jerome, how-
ever, uses libero to speak of liberation from a very
different set of things: his actors speak of deliver-
ance from manu (e.g., the hand of the Egyptians),
from ore (e.g., the mouth of the lion) and from
morte (death). A treebank encoded with lemma and
morpho-syntactic information lets us quantify these
typical arguments and thereby identify the use of the
word at any given time.
Named entity labeling. Our treebank’s place in
a digital library also means that complex searches
can draw on the resources that already lie therein.
Two of our major reference works include Smith’s
Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854),
which contains 11,564 place names, and Smith’s
Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and
Mythology (1873), which contains 20,336 personal
names. By mapping the lemmas in our treebank to
the entries in these dictionaries, we can determine
each lemma’s broad semantic class. After supple-
menting the Classical Dictionary with names from
the Vulgate, we find that the most common people
in the treebank are Iesus, Aeneas, Caesar, Catilina,
Satanas, Sibylla, Phoebus, Misenus and Iohannes;
the most common place names are Gallia, Babylon,
Troia, Hierusalem, Avernus and Sardis.
One use of such classification is to search for
verbs that are typically found with sentient agents.
We can find this by simply searching the treebank
for all active verbs with subjects known to be people
(i.e., subjects whose lemmas can be mapped to an
entry in Smith’s Dictionary). An excerpt of the list
that results is given in Table 3.

<bodyText confidence="0.9985575">
Aside from its intrinsic value of providing a cata-
logue of such verbs, a list like this is also useful for
classifying common nouns: if a verb is frequently
found with a person as its subject, all of its sub-
jects in general will likely be sentient as well. Table
4 presents a complete list of subjects of the active
voice of the verb mitto (to send) as attested in our

Only two of these subjects are proper names (Cae-

nary, but almost all of these nouns clearly belong
to the same semantic class – angelus, deus, diabo-

cognition.
Inducing semantic relationships of this sort is the
typical domain of clustering techniques such as la-

tent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990), but

By embedding this syntactic resource in a digital li-
brary and linking it to external resources such as ref-
erence works, we can find similar semantic relation-
ships with a much smaller corpus.

6 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999985933333333">
Treebanks already fill a niche in the NLP community
by providing valuable datasets for automatic pro-
cesses such as parsing and grammar induction. Their
utility, however, does not end there. The linguis-
tic information that treebanks encode is of value to a
wide range of potential users, including professional
scholars, students and amateurs, and we must en-
courage the use of these resources by making them
available to such a diverse community. The digital
library described in this paper has proved to be cru-
cial for the development and deployment of our tree-
bank: since the natural intuitions of native speakers
are hard to come by for historical languagues, it is all
the more important to leverage the cultural heritage
resources we already have.

If we take a single verb – libero (to free, liberate) – we can chart its use in various authors by asking a more specific question: what do different Latin authors want to be liberated from? We can imagine that an orator of the republic has little need to speak of liberation from eternal death, while an apostolic father is just as unlikely to speak of being freed from another’s monetary debt. 6For the importance of a treebank in expediting morphosyntactic research in Latin rhetoric and historical linguistics, see Bamman and Crane (2006). 38 We can answer this more general question by transforming it into a syntactic one: what are the most common complements of the lemma libero that are expressed in oblique cases (e.g., ablative, genitive, etc.) or as prepositional phrases? In a small test of 100 instances of the lemma in Cicero and Jerome, we find an interesting answer, presented in Table 2.

The efficient annotation of historical languages is hindered by the fact that no native speakers exist, and this is especially true of Latin, a difficult language with a high degree of non-projectivity. While the Penn Treebank can report a productivity rate of between 750 and 1000 words per hour for their annotators after four months of training (Taylor et al., 2003) and the Penn Chinese treebank can report a rate of 240-480 words per hour (Chiou et al., 2001), our annotation speeds are significantly slower, ranging from 90 words per hour to 281. Our best approach for Latin is to develop strategies that can speed up the annotation process, and here the resources found in a digital library are crucial. There are three varieties of contextual resources in our digital library that aid in the understanding of a text: translations, commentaries, and dictionaries. These resources shed light on a text, from the level of sentences to that of individual words. Translations. Translations provide reading support on a large scale: while loose translations may </context>

While modern treebanks are generally comprised of newspaper articles,1 historical treebanks are built from texts that have been the focus of study for centuries, if not millennia. The Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English (Kroch and Taylor, 2000), for example, includes Chaucer’s 14th-century Parson’s Tale, while the York Poetry Corpus (Pintzuk and Leendert, 2001) includes the entire text of Beowulf. The scholarship that has attended these texts since their writing has produced a wealth of contextual materials, including commentaries, translations, and linguistic resources. 1To name just three, the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) is comprised of texts from the Wall Street Journal; the German TIGER Treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is built from texts taken from the Frankfurter Rundschau; and the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc, 1998) includes articles from several daily newspapers (Lidov´e noviny and Mlad´a fronta Dnes), a business magazine (ˇCesko</context>

The efficient annotation of historical languages is hindered by the fact that no native speakers exist, and this is especially true of Latin, a difficult language with a high degree of non-projectivity. While the Penn Treebank can report a productivity rate of between 750 and 1000 words per hour for their annotators after four months of training (Taylor et al., 2003) and the Penn Chinese treebank can report a rate of 240-480 words per hour (Chiou et al., 2001), our annotation speeds are significantly slower, ranging from 90 words per hour to 281. Our best approach for Latin is to develop strategies that can speed up the annotation process, and here the resources found in a digital library are crucial. There are three varieties of contextual resources in our digital library that aid in the understanding of a text: translations, commentaries, and dictionaries. These resources shed light on a text, from the level of sentences to that of individual words. Tra</context>
