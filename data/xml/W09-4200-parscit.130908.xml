In recent years corpora have become an indispensable tool in research and everyday practice for
translators, lexicographers, second language learners. Specialists in these areas share a general goal in
using corpora in their work: corpora provide the possibility of finding and analysing linguistic patterns
characteristic of various kinds of language users, monitoring language change, and revealing important
similarities and divergences across different languages.
By this time, Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have matured to the point where much
more complex analysis of corpora becomes possible: more complex grammatical and lexical patterns
can be discovered, and new, more complex aspects of text (pragmatic, stylistic, etc.) can be analysed
computationally.
For professional translators, corpora represent an invaluable linguistic and cultural awareness tool. For
language learners, they serve as a means to gain insights into specifics of competent language use as
well as to analyse typical errors of fellow learners. For lexicographers, corpora are key for monitoring
the development of language vocabularies, making informed decisions as to lexicographic relevance of
the lexical material, and for general verification of all varieties of lexicographic data.
While simple corpus analysis tools such as concordancers have long been in use in these specialist
areas, in the past decade there have been important developments in Natural Language Processing
technologies: it has become much easier to construct corpora, and powerful NLP methods have become
available that can be used to analyse corpora not only at the surface level, but also at the syntactic, and
even semantic, pragmatic, and stylistic levels.
We believe that 2009 was an appropriate moment for the RANLP workshop on Natural Language
Processing Methods and Corpora in Translation, Lexicography, and Language Learning. It presented
recent studies covering the following topics: term and collocation extraction, corpora in translator
training, construction of lexical resource, lexical substitution techniques, word alignment, and
automatic tree alignment. The event was complemented by two invited speakers who presented several
studies where NLP methods and corpora have proved to be helpful.
The workshop brought together the developers and the users of NLP technologies for the purposes of
translation, translation studies, lexicography, terminology, and language learning in order to present
their research and discuss new possibilities and challenges in these research areas.
We are grateful to the organisers of the Seventh International Conference on Recent Advances in
Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2009, for holding this workshop in conjunction to the main
conference. We are also thankful to the Programme Committee for their commitment and support in
the reviewing process and to the researchers who submitted papers to this workshop.
