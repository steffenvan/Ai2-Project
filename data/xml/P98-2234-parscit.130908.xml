Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999882666666667">
Determining the attachments of prepositions
and subordinate conjunctions is a key prob-
lem in parsing natural language. This paper
presents a trainable approach to making these
attachments through transformation sequences
and error-driven learning. Our approach is
broad coverage, and accounts for roughly three
times the attachment cases that have previously
been handled by corpus-based techniques. In
addition, our approach is based on a simplified
model of syntax that is more consistent with
the practice in current state-of-the-art language
processing systems. This paper sketches syntac-
tic and algorithmic details, and presents exper-
imental results on data sets derived from the
Penn Treebank. We obtain an attachment ac-
curacy of 75.4% for the general case, the first
such corpus-based result to be reported. For the
restricted cases previously studied with corpus-
based methods, our approach yields an accuracy
comparable to current work (83.1%).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9984872">
Determining the attachments of prepositions
and subordinate conjunctions is an important
problem in parsing natural language. It is also
an old problem that continues to elude a com-
plete solution. A classic example of the problem
is the sentence &amp;quot;I saw a man with a telescope&amp;quot;,
where who had the telescope is ambiguous.
Recently, the preposition attachment prob-
lem has been addressed using corpus-based
methods (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi

et al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and
Brooks, 1995; Merlo et al., 1997). The present
paper follows in the path set by these authors,
but extends their work in significant ways. We
made these extensions to solve this problem in
a way that can be directly applied in running
systems in such application areas as informa-
tion extraction or conversational interfaces.
In particular, we have sought to produce an
attachment decision procedure with far broader
coverage than in earlier approaches. Most re-
search to date has focussed on a subset of the
attachment problem that only covers 25% of the
problem instances in our training data, the so-
called binary VNP subset. Even the broader
V[NP1* subset addressed by (Merlo et al., 1997)
only accounts for 33% of the problem instances.
In contrast, our approach attempts to form at-
tachments for as much as 89% of the problem
instances (modulo some cases that are either
pathological or accounted for by other means).
Work to date has also been concerned pri-
marily with reproducing the structure of Tree-
bank annotations. In other words, the underly-
ing syntactic paradigm has been the traditional
notion of full sentential parsing. This approach
differs from the parsing models currently be-
ing explored by both theorists and practitioners,
which include semi-parsing strategies and finite-
state approximations to context-free grammars.
Our approach to syntax uses a cascade of
rule sequence processors, each of which can be
thought of as approximating some aspect of the
underlying grammar by finite-state transduc-
tion. We have thus had to extend previous work
at the conceptual level as well, by recasting the
preposition attachment problem in terms of the
vocabulary of finite-state approximations (noun
groups, etc.), rather than the traditional syntac-
tic categories (noun phrases, etc.).

Much of the present paper is thus concerned
with describing our extensions to the prepo-
sition attachment problem. We present the
problem scope of interest to us, as well as the
data annotations required to support our in-
vestigation. We also present a decision pro-
cedure for attaching prepositions and subordi-
nate conjunctions. The procedure is trained
through error-driven transformation learning
(Brill, 1993), and we present a number of
training experiments and report on the per-
formance of the trained procedure. In brief,
on the restricted VNP problem, our proce-
dure achieves nearly the same level of test-set
performance (83.1%) as current state-of-the-art
systems (84.5% (Collins and Brooks, 1995)).
On the unrestricted data set, our procedure
achieves an attachment accuracy of 75.4%.

2 Syntactic Considerations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979257142858">
Our outlook on the attachment problem is in-
fluenced by our approach to syntax, which sim-
plifies the traditional parsing problem in sev-
eral ways. As with many approaches to pro-
cessing unrestricted text, we do not attempt
as a primary goal to derive spanning senten-
tial parses. Instead, we approximate spanning
parses through successive stages of partial pars-
ing. For the purpose of the present paper, we
need to mostly be concerned with the level of
analysis of core noun phrases and verb phrases.
By core phrases, we mean the kind of non-
recursive simplifications of the NP and VP that
in the literature go by names such as noun/verb
groups (Appelt et al., 1993) or chunks, and base
NPs (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
The common thread between these ap-
proaches and ours is to approximate full noun
phrases or verb phrases by only parsing their
non-recursive core, and thus not attaching mod-
ifiers or arguments. For English noun phrases,
this amounts to roughly the span between the
determiner and the head noun; for English verb
phrases, the span runs roughly from the auxil-
iary to the head verb. We call such simplified
syntactic categories groups, and consider in par-
ticular noun, verb, adverb and adjective groups.
For noun groups in particular, the definition
we have adopted also includes a limited num-
ber of constructs that encompass some depth-
bounded recursion. For example, we also in-
dude in the scope of the noun group such com-
plex determiners as partitives (&amp;quot;five of the sus-
pects&amp;quot;) and possessives (&amp;quot;John&apos;s book&amp;quot;). These
constructs fall under the scope of our noun
group model because they are easy to parse
with simple finite-state cascades, and because
they more intuitively match the notion of a core
phrase than do their individual components.
Our model of noun groups also includes an ex-
tension of the so-called named entities familiar
to the information extraction community (Def,
1995). These consist of names of persons and or-
ganizations, location names, titles, dates, times,
and various numeric expressions (such as money
terms). Note in particular that titles and orga-
nization names often include embedded prepo-
sitional phrases (e.g., &amp;quot;Chief of Staff&amp;quot;). For
such cases, as well as for partitives, we con-
sider these embedded prepositional phrases to
be within the noun group&apos;s scope, and as such
are excluded from consideration as attachment
problems. Also excluded are the auxiliary to&apos;s
in verb groups for infinitives.
Once again, distinguishing syntax groups
from traditional syntactic phrases (such as NPs)
is of interest because it singles out what is usu-
ally thought of as easy to parse, and allows that
piece of the parsing problem to be addressed by
such comparatively simple means as finite-state
machines or transformation sequences. What
is then left of the parsing problem is the dif-
ficult stuff: namely the attachment of preposi-
tional phrases, relative clauses, and other con-
structs that serve in modificational, adjunctive,
or argument-passing roles. This part of the
problem is harder both because of the ambigu-
ous attachment location, and because the right
combination of knowledge required to reduce
this ambiguity is elusive.

3 The Attachment Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999978">
Given these syntactic preliminaries, we can now
define attachment problems in terms of syn-
tax groups. In addition to noun, verb, adjec-
tive and adverb groups, we also have I-groups.
An I-group is a preposition (including multiple
word prepositions) or subordinate conjunction
(including wh-words and &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;). Once again
prepositions that are embedded in such con-
structs as titles and names are not considered I-
groups for our purposes. Each I-group in a sen-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.966832">
1437
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962348">
tence is viewed as attaching to one other group
within that sentence.&apos; For example, the sen-
tence &amp;quot;I had sent a cup to her.&amp;quot; is viewed as
[I]ng [had senth,g,&lt;, la cuping therhig•
where r&gt; indicates the attaching I-group and a
indicates the group attached to.
Generally, coordinations of groups (e.g., dogs
and cats) are left as separate groups. However,
prenominal coordination (e.g. dog and cat food)
is deemed as one large noun group.
Attachments not to try: Our system is de-
signed to attach each I-group in a sentence
to one other group in the sentence on that I-
group&apos;s left. In our sample data, about 11% of
the I-groups have no left ambiguity (either no
group on the left to attach to or only 1 group).
A few (less than 0.5%) of the I-groups have no
group to its right. All of these I-groups count
as attachments not handled by our system and
our system does not attempt to resolve them.
Attachments to try: The rest of the I-groups
each have at least 2 groups on their left and 1
group on their right from the I-group&apos;s sentence,
and these are the I-groups that our system tries
to handle (89% of all the problems in the data).

4 Properties of Attachments to Try
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993762125">
In order to understand how our technique han-
dles the attachments that follow this pattern, it
is helpful to consider the properties of this class
of attachments. What we detail here is a spe-
cific analysis of our test data (called 7x9x). Our
training sample is similar.
In 7x9x, 2.4% of the attachments turn out
to be of a form that guarantees our system
will fail to resolve them. 83% of these un-
resolvable &amp;quot;attachments&amp;quot; are about evenly di-
vided between right attachments and left at-
tachments to a coordination of groups (which in
our framework is split into 2 or more groups). A
right attachment example is that &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; attaches
to &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;that at home, they lost a key.&amp;quot; A
coordination attachment example is &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; at-
taching to the coordination &amp;quot;cats and dogs&amp;quot; in
&amp;quot;cats and dogs with tags&amp;quot;. The other 17% were
either lexemes erroneously tagged as preposi-
tions/subordinate conjunctions or past partici-
ples, or were wh-words that are actually part
&apos;Sentential level attachments are deemed to be to the
main verb in the sentence attached to.
of a question (and not acting as a subordinate
conjunction).
In 7x9x, 67.7% of attachments are to the ad-
jacent group on the I-group&apos;s immediate left.
Our system uses as a starting point the guess
that all attachments are to the adjacent group.
The second most likely attachment point is
the nearest verb group to the I-group&apos;s left. A
surprising 90.3% of the attachments are to ei-
ther this verb group or to the adjacent group.2
In our experiments, limiting the choice of pos-
sible attachment points to these two tended to
improve the results and also increased the train-
ing speed, the latter often by a factor of 3 to 4.
Neither of these percentages include attach-
ments to coordinations of groups on the left,
which are unhandleable. Including these attach-
ments would add —1% to each figure.
The attachments can be divided into six cat-
egories, based on the contents of the I-group be-
ing attached and the types of groups surround-
ing that I-group. The categories are:
vnpn The I-group contains a preposition. Next
to the preposition on both the left and the
right are noun groups. Next to the left
noun group is a verb group. A member
of this category is the [to]/9 in the sentence
&amp;quot;[I]ng [had sentlyg [a cuph-ig Rol [her]9.&amp;quot;
vnpri Like vnpn, but next to the preposition
on the right is not a noun group.
vnpn Like vnpn, but the left neighbor of the
left noun group is not a verb group.
vnpn Another variation on vnpn.
xripx The I-group contains a preposition. But
its left neighbor is not a noun group. The
x&apos;s stand for groups that need to exist, but
can be of any type.
XXSX The I-group has a subordinate conjunc-
tion (e.g. which) instead of a preposition.&apos;

Much of the corpus-based work on attaching
prepositions (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Brill and
Resnik, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995) has
dealt with the subset of category vnpn prob-
lems where the preposition actually attaches to
either the nearest verb or noun group on the
left. Some earlier work (Hindle and Rooth,
1993) also handled the subset of vnpri category
problems where the attachment is either to the
nearest verb or noun group on the left.
Some later work (Merlo et al., 1997) dealt
with handling from 1 to 3 prepositional phrases
in a sentence. The work dealt with preposi-
tions in &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; sequences of VNP, VNPNP
and VNPNPNP, where the prepositions attach
to one of the mentioned noun or verb groups (as
opposed to an earlier group on the left). So this
work handles attachments that can be found in
the vnpn, vnpri, crnpn and Crnpri categories.
Still, this work handles less than an estimated
33% of our sample text&apos;s atta.clunents.4
4(Merlo et al., 1997) searches the Penn Treebank for
data samples that they can handle. They find phrases
where 78% of the items to attach belong to either the
vnpn or vnpfi categories. So in Penn Treebank, they
handle 1.28 times more attachments than the other work
mentioned in this paper. This other work handles less
than 25% of the attachments in our sample data.

5 Processing Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99914196">
Our attachment system is an extension of the
rule-based system for VNPN binary preposi-
tional phrase attachment described in (Brill and
Resnik, 1994). The system uses transformation-
based error-driven learning to automatically
learn rules from training examples.
One first runs the system on a training set,
which starts by guessing that each I-group at-
taches to its left adjacent group. This training
run moves in iterations, with each iteration pro-
ducing the next rule that repairs the most re-
maining attachment errors in the training set.
The training run ends when the next rule found
repairs less than a threshold number of errors.
The rules are then run in the same order on
the test set (which also starts at an all adjacent
attachment state) to see how well they do.
The system makes its decisions based on the
head (main) word of each of the groups ex-
amined. Like the original system, our system
can look at the head-word itself and also all
the semantic classes the head-word can belong
to. The classes come from Wordnet (Miller,
1990) and consist of about 25 noun classes
(e.g., person, process) and 15 verb classes (e.g.,
change, communication, status). As an exten-
sion, our system also looks at the word&apos;s part-
of-speech, possible stem(s) and possible subcat-
egorization/complement categories. The latter
consist of over 100 categories for nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs (mainly the latter) from Comlex
(Wolff et al., 1995). Example categories include
intransitive verbs and verbs that take 2 prepo-
sitional phrases as a complement (e.g., fly in &amp;quot;I
fly from here to them.&amp;quot;). In addition, Comlex
gives our system the possible prepositions (e.g.
from and to for the verb fly) and particles used
in the possible subcategorizations.
The original system chose between two possi-
ble attachment points, a verb and a noun. Each
rule either attempted to move left (attach to
the verb) or move right (attach to the noun).
Our extensions include as possible attachment
points every group that precedes the attaching
I-group and is in the I-group&apos;s sentence. The
rules now can move the attachment either left
or right from the current guess to the nearest
group that matches the rule&apos;s constraints.
In addition to running the training and test
with ALL possible attachment points (every

<bodyText confidence="0.999836833333333">
preceding group) available, one can also re-
strict the possible attachment points to only the
group Adjacent to the I-group and the nearest
Verb group on the left, if any (V-A). One uses
the same attachment choice (ALL versus V-A)
in the training run and corresponding test run.

6.1 Data preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993745121951219">
Our experiments were conducted with data
made available through the Penn Treebank an-
notation effort (Marcus et al., 1993). However,
since our grammar model is based on syntax
groups, not conventional categories, we needed
to extend the Treebank annotations to include
the constructs of interest to us.
This was accomplished in several steps. First,
noun groups and verb groups were manually
annotated using Treebank data that had been
stripped of all phrase structure markup.5 This
syntax group markup was then reconciled with
the Treebank annotations by a semi-automatic
procedure. Usually, the procedure just needs to
overlay the syntax group markup on top of the
Treebank annotations. However, the Treebank
annotations often had to be adjusted to make
them consistent with the syntax groups (e.g.,
verbal auxiliaries need to be included in the rel-
evant verb phrase). Some 4-5% of all Treebank
sentences could not be automatically reconciled
in this way, and were removed from the data
sets for these experiments.
The reconciliation procedure also automati-
cally tags the data for part-of-speech, using a
high-performance tagger based on (Brill, 1993).
Finally, the reconciler introduces adjective, ad-
verb, and I-group markup. I-groups are created
for all lexemes tagged with the IN, TO, WDT,
WP, WP$ or WRB parts of speech, as well as
multi-word prepositions such as according to.
The reconciled data are then compiled
into attachment problems using another semi-
automatic pattern-matching procedure. 8% of
the cases did not fit into the patterns and re-
quired manual intervention.
We split our data into a training set (files
2000, 2013, and 200-269) and a test set (files
270-299). Because manual intervention is time
consuming, it was only performed on the test
set. The training set (called Ox6x) has 2615

The preliminary experiment with our system
compares it to previous work (Ra,tnaparkhi et
al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and
Brooks, 1995) when handling VNPN binary PP
attachment ambiguity. In our terms, the task
is to determine the attachment of certain vnpn
category I-groups. The data originally was used
in (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) and was derived
from the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal.
It consists of about 21,000 training examples
(call this It, short for large-training) and about
3000 test examples. The format of this data
is slightly different than for Ox6x and 7x9x:
for each sample, only the 4 mentioned groups
(VNPN) are provided, and for each group, this
data just provides the head-word. As a result,
our part-of-speech tagger could not run on this
data, so we temporarily adjusted our system
to only consider two part-of-speech categories:
numbers for words with just commas, periods
and digits, and non-numbers for all other words.
The training used a 3 improvement threshold.
With these rules, the percent correct on the test
set went from 59.0% (guess all adjacent attach-
ments) to 83.1%, an error reduction of 58.9%.
This result is just a little behind the current
best result of 84.5% (Collins and Brooks, 1995)
(using a binomial distribution test, the differ-
ence is statistically significant at the 2% level).
(Collins and Brooks, 1995) also reports a result
of 81.9% for a word only version of the system
(Brill and Resnik, 1994) that we extend (differ-
ence with our result is statistically significant at
the 4% level). So our system is competitive on
a known task.

ALL or the V-A Attachment Points are used.
The other source is the TRaining SET used.
The set /t- is the set it (Section 6.2) with
the entries from Penn Treebank Wall St. Jour-
nal files 270 to 299 (the files used to form the
test set) removed. About 600 entries were re-
moved. Several adjustments were made when
using /t-: The part-of-speech treatment in Sec-
tion 6.2 was used. Because it only gives two
possible attachment points (the adjacent noun
and the nearest verb), only V-A attachment
points were used. Finally, because It- is much
slower to train on than Ox6x, training used a 3
improvement threshold. For Ox6x, a 2 improve-
ment threshold was used.
Set /t2 is the data used in (Merlo et al., 1997)
and has about 26000 entries. The set 1t2- is the
set /t2 with the entries from Penn TreebanIc files
270-299 removed. Again, about 600 entries were
removed. Generally, 1t2 has no information on
the word(s) to the right of the preposition being
attached, so this field was ignored in both train-
ing and test. In addition, for similar reasons as
given for It- , the adjustments made when using
it- were also made when using /tr..
If one removes the 1t2- results, then all the
COR results are statistically significantly differ-
ent from the starting 67.7% score and from each
other at a 1% level or better. In addition, the
/t2- and It- results are not statistically signifi-
cantly different (even at the 20% level).
/t2- has more data points and more cate-
gories of data than It- , but the it run has
the best overall score. Besides pure chance, two
other possible reasons for this somewhat sur-
prising result are that the 1t2- entries have no
information on the word(s) to the right of the
preposition being attached (It- does) and both
datasets contain entries not in the other dataset.
When looking at the It- run&apos;s remaining er-
rors, 43% of the errors were in category ir-npn,

The location of most of the best subscores is
not surprising. Of the training sets, /t- has the
most vnpn entries,6 1t2- has the most Vnp-
type entries and Ox6x has the most XXSX entries.
The best vnpri and xripx subscore locations are
somewhat surprising. The best vnpri subscore
is statistically significantly better than the 1t2-
vnpri subscore at the 5% level. A possible ex-
planation is that the vnpri and vnpn categories
are closely related. The best xripx subscore is
not statistically significantly better than the It-
xiipx subscore, even at the 25% level. Besides
pure chance, a possible explanation is that the
xripx category is related to the four np-type
categories (where 1t2- has the most entries).
The fact that the subscores for the various
categories differ according to training regimen
suggests a system architecture that would ex-
ploit this. In particular, we might apply dif-
ferent rule sets for each attachment category,
with each rule set trained in the optimal con-
figuration for that category. We would thus
expect the overall accuracy of the attachment
procedure to improve overall. To estimate the
magnitude of this improvement, we calculated
a post-hoc composite score on our test set by
combining the best subscore for each of the 6
categories. When viewed as trying to improve
upon the It- subscores, the new Crnpri subscore
is statistically significantly better (4% level) and
the new xxsx subscore is mildly statistically sig-
nificantly better (20% level). The new Vnpn
and xlipx subscores are not statistically sig-
nificantly better, even at the 25% level. This
combination yields a post-hoc improved score
of 76.5%. This is of course only a post-hoc es-
timate, and we would need to run a new inde-
pendent test to verify the actual validity of this
effect. Also, this estimate is only mildly statis-
tically significantly better (13% level) than the
existing 75.4% score.

This paper presents a system for attaching
prepositions and subordinate conjunctions that
just relies on easy-to-find constructs like noun
groups to determine when it is applicable. In
sample text, we find that the system is appli-
cable for trying to attach 89% of the preposi-
tions/subordinate conjunctions that are outside
of the easy-to-find constructs and is 75.4% cor-
rect on the attachments that it tries to handle.
In this sample, we also notice that these attach-
ments very much tend to be to only one or two
different spots and that the attachment prob-
lems can be divided into 6 categories. One just
needs those easy-to-find constructs to determine
the category of an attachment problem.
The 75.4% results may seen low compared to
parsing results like the 88% precision and re-
call in (Collins, 1997), but those parsing results
include many easier-to-parse constructs. (Man-
ning and Carpenter, 1997) presents the VNPN
example phrase &amp;quot;saw the man with a telescope&amp;quot;,
where attaching the preposition incorrectly can
still result in 80% (4 of 5) recall, 100% preci-
sion and no crossing brackets. Of the 4 recalled
constructs, 3 are easy-to-parse: 2 correspond to
noun groups and 1 is the parse top level.
In our experiments, we found that limiting
the choice of possible attachment points to the
two most likely ones improved performance.
This limiting also lets us use the large train-
ing sets lt- and lt2- . In addition, we found
that different training data produces rules that
work better in different categories. This lat-
ter result suggests trying a system architecture
where each attachment category is handled by
the rule set most suited for that category.
In the best overall result, nearly half of the
remaining errors occur in one category, iinpn,
so this is the category in need of most work.
Another topic to examine is how many of the
remaining attachment errors actually matter.
For instance, when one&apos;s interest is on finding
a semantic interpretation of the sentence &amp;quot;They
flash letters on a screen.&amp;quot;, whether on attaches
to flash or to letters is irrelevant. Both the let-
ters are, and the flashing occurs, on a screen.

<abstract confidence="0.981195090909091">Determining the attachments of prepositions and subordinate conjunctions is a key problem in parsing natural language. This paper presents a trainable approach to making these attachments through transformation sequences and error-driven learning. Our approach is broad coverage, and accounts for roughly three times the attachment cases that have previously been handled by corpus-based techniques. In addition, our approach is based on a simplified model of syntax that is more consistent with the practice in current state-of-the-art language processing systems. This paper sketches syntactic and algorithmic details, and presents experimental results on data sets derived from the Penn Treebank. We obtain an attachment accuracy of 75.4% for the general case, the first such corpus-based result to be reported. For the restricted cases previously studied with corpusbased methods, our approach yields an accuracy comparable to current work (83.1%).</abstract>

Instead, we approximate spanning parses through successive stages of partial parsing. For the purpose of the present paper, we need to mostly be concerned with the level of analysis of core noun phrases and verb phrases. By core phrases, we mean the kind of nonrecursive simplifications of the NP and VP that in the literature go by names such as noun/verb groups (Appelt et al., 1993) or chunks, and base NPs (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). The common thread between these approaches and ours is to approximate full noun phrases or verb phrases by only parsing their non-recursive core, and thus not attaching modifiers or arguments. For English noun phrases, this amounts to roughly the span between the determiner and the head noun; for English verb phrases, the span runs roughly from the auxiliary to the head verb. We call such simplified syntactic categories groups, and consider in particular noun, verb, adverb and adjective groups. For noun groups in particular, the definition w</context>

Some earlier work (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) also handled the subset of vnpri category problems where the attachment is either to the nearest verb or noun group on the left. Some later work (Merlo et al., 1997) dealt with handling from 1 to 3 prepositional phrases in a sentence.

They find phrases where 78% of the items to attach belong to either the vnpn or vnpfi categories. So in Penn Treebank, they handle 1.28 times more attachments than the other work mentioned in this paper. This other work handles less than 25% of the attachments in our sample data. 5 Processing Model Our attachment system is an extension of the rule-based system for VNPN binary prepositional phrase attachment described in (Brill and Resnik, 1994). The system uses transformationbased error-driven learning to automatically learn rules from training examples. One first runs the system on a training set, which starts by guessing that each I-group attaches to its left adjacent group. This training run moves in iterations, with each iteration producing the next rule that repairs the most remaining attachment errors in the training set. The training run ends when the next rule found repairs less than a threshold number of errors. The rules are then run in the same order on the test set (which also starts at an all adjacent attachment state) </context>

The training set (called Ox6x) has 2615 5We used files 200-299, along with files 2000 and 2013. attachment problems and the test set (called 7x9x) has 2252 attachment problems. 6.2 Preliminary test The preliminary experiment with our system compares it to previous work (Ra,tnaparkhi et al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995) when handling VNPN binary PP attachment ambiguity. In our terms, the task is to determine the attachment of certain vnpn category I-groups. The data originally was used in (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) and was derived from the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal. It consists of about 21,000 training examples (call this It, short for large-training) and about 3000 test examples. The format of this data is slightly different than for Ox6x and 7x9x: for each sample, only the 4 mentioned groups (VNPN) are provided, and for each group, this data just provides the head-word.

The training used a 3 improvement threshold. With these rules, the percent correct on the test set went from 59.0% (guess all adjacent attachments) to 83.1%, an error reduction of 58.9%. This result is just a little behind the current best result of 84.5% (Collins and Brooks, 1995) (using a binomial distribution test, the difference is statistically significant at the 2% level). (Collins and Brooks, 1995) also reports a result of 81.9% for a word only version of the system (Brill and Resnik, 1994) that we extend (difference with our result is statistically significant at the 4% level).

Usually, the procedure just needs to overlay the syntax group markup on top of the Treebank annotations. However, the Treebank annotations often had to be adjusted to make them consistent with the syntax groups (e.g., verbal auxiliaries need to be included in the relevant verb phrase). Some 4-5% of all Treebank sentences could not be automatically reconciled in this way, and were removed from the data sets for these experiments. The reconciliation procedure also automatically tags the data for part-of-speech, using a high-performance tagger based on (Brill, 1993). Finally, the reconciler introduces adjective, adverb, and I-group markup. I-groups are created for all lexemes tagged with the IN, TO, WDT, WP, WP$ or WRB parts of speech, as well as multi-word prepositions such as according to. The reconciled data are then compiled into attachment problems using another semiautomatic pattern-matching procedure. 8% of the cases did not fit into the patterns and required manual intervention.

For the restricted cases previously studied with corpusbased methods, our approach yields an accuracy comparable to current work (83.1%). 1 Introduction Determining the attachments of prepositions and subordinate conjunctions is an important problem in parsing natural language. It is also an old problem that continues to elude a complete solution. A classic example of the problem is the sentence &amp;quot;I saw a man with a telescope&amp;quot;, where who had the telescope is ambiguous. Recently, the preposition attachment problem has been addressed using corpus-based methods (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi • This paper reports on work performed at the MITRE Corporation under the support of the MITRE Sponsored Research Program.

In addition to running the training and test with ALL possible attachment points (every 1439 preceding group) available, one can also restrict the possible attachment points to only the group Adjacent to the I-group and the nearest Verb group on the left, if any (V-A). One uses the same attachment choice (ALL versus V-A) in the training run and corresponding test run. 6 Experiments 6.1 Data preparation Our experiments were conducted with data made available through the Penn Treebank annotation effort (Marcus et al., 1993). However, since our grammar model is based on syntax groups, not conventional categories, we needed to extend the Treebank annotations to include the constructs of interest to us. This was accomplished in several steps. First, noun groups and verb groups were manually annotated using Treebank data that had been stripped of all phrase structure markup.5 This syntax group markup was then reconciled with the Treebank annotations by a semi-automatic procedure. Usually, the procedure just needs to overlay the syntax group markup on top of the Treebank annotations. However, the Treebank annotations</context>

As with many approaches to processing unrestricted text, we do not attempt as a primary goal to derive spanning sentential parses. Instead, we approximate spanning parses through successive stages of partial parsing. For the purpose of the present paper, we need to mostly be concerned with the level of analysis of core noun phrases and verb phrases. By core phrases, we mean the kind of nonrecursive simplifications of the NP and VP that in the literature go by names such as noun/verb groups (Appelt et al., 1993) or chunks, and base NPs (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). The common thread between these approaches and ours is to approximate full noun phrases or verb phrases by only parsing their non-recursive core, and thus not attaching modifiers or arguments. For English noun phrases, this amounts to roughly the span between the determiner and the head noun; for English verb phrases, the span runs roughly from the auxiliary to the head verb. We call such simplified syntactic categories groups, and consider in particular noun, verb, adverb and adjective groups. For noun groups in particular, the definition we have adopted also includes a limited number of co</context>

In our terms, the task is to determine the attachment of certain vnpn category I-groups. The data originally was used in (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) and was derived from the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal. It consists of about 21,000 training examples (call this It, short for large-training) and about 3000 test examples. The format of this data is slightly different than for Ox6x and 7x9x: for each sample, only the 4 mentioned groups (VNPN) are provided, and for each group, this data just provides the head-word.
