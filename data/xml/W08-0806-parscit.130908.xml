1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999778714285714">
Designing assistive communication technologies
for people with speech and language disabilities
involves a number of challenges including address-
ing stigma and portability concerns. Mobile de-
vices have the potential to resolve some of these
issues if disadvantages such as small screen size
and difficult interaction techniques are tackled.
Our experience shows that a mobile device and
a desktop computer can serve in synergy as an ef-
fective communication support for people with
aphasia, a disability that impairs the language mo-
dalities. Our work has also showed that assisting
the user effectively is interlaced with the ability to
provide flexible and personalizable support.

2 Mobile Support for Communication
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987777777778">
Being able to communicate is essential to leading a
self-sufficient and satisfying life. Individuals who
suffer from aphasia experience many challenges,
including social isolation (Kauhanen et al., 2000).
Technology has the potential to help such indi-
viduals, but to enhance the users’ daily communi-
cation effectively, tools need to be portable and
usable outside of the home.
Our research focuses on designing multimodal
communication systems for people with aphasia.
We are interested in small and light-weight devices
because their use is inconspicuous in public which
addresses stigma issues prevalent among users
with disabilities. Mobile devices have obvious
shortcomings such as limited screen size and inter-
action techniques, and relatively small memory.
However, if they assume the role of an extension
instead of a replacement of traditional desktop and
laptop assistive systems, we can easily take advan-
tage of their positive characteristics–portability
being the most important one. In addition, mobile
devices which have embedded camera, microphone,
and speaker are convenient for taking photos, re-
cording videos and sounds which can enhance
communication. To compensate for the loss of lan-
guage, visual and audio representations are essen-
tial support for information comprehension and
speech production.
There has been consistently increasing interest in
using mobile platforms for applications that support
communication. For example, Davies et al. (2004)
extensively studied one individual with aphasia who
incorporated a personal digital assistant (PDA) into
his daily communication strategies and demonstrated
the device’s potential. Moffatt et al. (2004) imple-
mented an electronic daily planner enhanced with
images and sounds, running on a PDA. Even though
it received positive feedback when evaluated with
aphasic individuals, the prevalently elderly subjects
had difficulty in composing and editing appointments
directly on the PDA.
Considering the advantages and disadvantages
of a personal digital assistant, we combined a PDA
and a desktop computer into a hybrid communica-
tion system for people with aphasia.

3 Hybrid Communication System

<bodyText confidence="0.999936933333333">
The desktop component of the hybrid communica-
tion system is used to compose and edit sentences
and the PDA is used as a portable extension for
conversations outside of home. A multimodal ap-
proach is used to compensate for the considerable
variability in language impairments among indi-
viduals with aphasia. In the system’s vocabulary,
nouns are represented by text, sound and an image
while verbs are represented by text, sound and an
animation depicting the action. Users enjoyed and
were able to work with the system, and they incor-
porated multiple photographs taken with the PDA
into their communication (Boyd-Graber et al.,
2006). The evaluation also revealed certain weak-
nesses and confirmed the need for flexibility and

4.1 Web-based System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994956521739">
The fact that most mobile devices nowadays can
access and browse the Internet relatively easily
encourages us to explore a web-based system. By
having the desktop and mobile components com-
municate online, we circumvent the time and loca-
tion constraints of traditional synchronization
methods. Even though data can be transferred eas-
ily between the two components of our system, the
need for physical contact is a drawback if multiple
parties are involved in the information sharing (for
example, when the aphasia patient, her speech-
language pathologist and her caregiver need to ac-
cess and modify information on different desktops
at different locations).
A web-based system will also eliminate the de-
pendence on the mobile device’s limited storage,
which dictates the quantity and quality of the mul-
timedia data available to the user. The user will
have access to more pictures, videos, and audio
clips stored on the server. A web-based system will
also allow for sharing of resources online among
users within the aphasic community which could
forge new social connections.

4.2 Building an Adaptable Vocabulary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994275862069">
An essential component of a communication sys-
tem that attempts to be flexible, extensible, and
expressive is the vocabulary that it offers to the
users. Vocabulary depth, breadth, organization and
management are major challenges in existing assis-
tive technologies including our own.
We are addressing these problems by designing
a vocabulary application enhanced with adaptive
and adaptable features. The goal is to enable apha-
sic users to build phrases quickly by browsing
through a smart network of words represented by a
triplet of image, sound and text. The links between
words are based on the individual’s vocabulary
profile (frequently used words, personal interests
and communication context) as well as word simi-
larity and evocation measures derived from Word-
Net (Miller, 1990). The system’s adaptability will
let the user add and remove words, group the
words in a personalized manner by creating their
own categories (such as a “Favorites” folder) and
enhance them with images and sounds. The adap-
tive part will study the usage frequency of each
word, make context relevant suggestions, and
adapt the vocabulary organization automatically.
Thus, frequently used words and words relevant to
the user’s interests or the context of the communi-
cation will surface faster. Naturally, the challenge
is balancing the adaptive and adaptable aspects of
the system to best benefit the user.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996725">
Even though small screen size and challenging in-
teraction techniques make most existing mobile
devices unusable for persons with aphasia, they
hold a significant potential to assist daily commu-
nication effectively. We envision that a web-based
communication system with a mobile and a desk-
top component will be an effective support because
it will eliminate constraints related to data transfer
and information updating. We are also working on
creating adaptive and adaptable techniques that
allow the vocabulary used for communication to be
tailored to the user’s needs. We are interested in
discussing effective design strategies and interac-
tion technique for language application for mobile
devices as well as methods to make them serve as
better communication support.
