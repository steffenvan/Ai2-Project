Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999924894736842">
The ability to request clarification
of utterances is a vital part of the
communicative process. In this pa-
per we discuss the range of possi-
ble forms for clarification requests,
together with the range of read-
ings they can convey. We present
the results of corpus analysis which
show a correlation between certain
forms and possible readings, to-
gether with some indication of maxi-
mum likely distance between request
and the utterance being clarified.
We then explain the implications of
these results for a possible HPSG
analysis of clarification requests and
for an ongoing implementation of
a clarification-capable dialogue sys-
tem.l

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999663181818182">
Clarification requests (CRs) are common in
human conversation. They can take various
forms and can be intended by the speaker
making the request (the CR initiator) to re-
quest various types of clarification informa-
tion (i.e. they can have various readings),
but have in common the fact that they are
in a sense meta-dialogue acts — they concern
the content or form of a previous utterance
that has failed to be fully comprehended by
the initiator.

It is not usual for computer dialogue sys-
tems do be able to process CRs produced by
the user. One can see how important this
might be in a negotiative dialogue by consid-
ering the following imagined exchange, which
gives some possible alternative responses to a
CR initiated by the caller:
System: Would you like to travel via
Paris or Amsterdam?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.891836777777778">
Caller: Paris?
System: (a) Yes, Paris.
(b) Paris, France.
(c) Paris is the quickest
route, although Amster-
dam is the cheapest.
(d) OK. Your ticket via
Paris will be posted to you.
Goodbye.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998782789473684">
Any of responses (a)—(c), which correctly
interpret the caller&apos;s move as a CR, might be
regarded as useful to the caller: response (d),
which incorrectly interprets it as an answer
to the system&apos;s question, would not be ac-
ceptable under any circumstances. Which of
(a)—(c) is preferred will depend on the reading
intended. As a first step towards a full theory
of CR interpretation, we therefore believe it
is important to have information about which
readings are available via which forms.
Previous studies have examined some indi-
vidual CR forms and given possible analyses
for these forms. In this paper we describe an
attempt to exhaustively categorise CR forms
and readings based on corpus work, and dis-
cuss the implications of our results for further
analysis.
The analyses so far proposed require all in-

formation from a previous utterance to be re-
tained in memory (not only propositional con-
tent but syntax and phonology). The reten-
tion of such a large amount of information in-
definitely poses obvious problems for any im-
plementation with finite resources, and seems
at odds with some results from work in psy-
cholinguistics: studies such as (Sachs, 1967;
van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983) have argued that
surface information such as syntax is retained
only in the short term (see (Fletcher, 1994)
for an overview). Our corpus work has there-
fore had the additional aim of identification
of the maximum distance between a CR and
the utterance being clarified (the source ut-
terance).
In this section we give a brief overview
of CR forms identified in previous work, to-
gether with the analyses proposed and the
readings that these analyses give rise to. In
sections 2 and 3 we list the possible CR forms
and readings that we have identified from
corpus analysis. In section 4 we describe
this analysis and give detailed results, includ-
ing a discussion of apparent correlations be-
tween certain forms and readings and of max-
imum observed CR-source separation (CSS)
distance. Finally, in section 5 we discuss the
implications of our findings for an intended
dialogue system implementation.

1.1 Previous Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938344533333333">
(Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) (hereafter G&amp;S)
discuss reprise interrogatives, which they fur-
ther classify into echo questions (those &amp;quot;re-
sulting from mishearing a previous speech
act&amp;quot; — see B&apos;s question in example (2)) and
reference questions (those which &amp;quot;ask for clar-
ification of the reference of some element in
the immediately prior utterance&amp;quot; — see exam-
ple (3)).
A: Did Jill phone?
B: Did JILL phone?
tionary force of the (previous) utterance&amp;quot; be-
ing reprised. In other words, B&apos;s utterances
in the examples above both involve query-
ing some feature of A&apos;s query. They might
be paraphrased &amp;quot;Are you asking whether Jill
phoned?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;For which person are you
asking whether that person phoned?&amp;quot;, respec-
tively.
They therefore offer a syntactic and seman-
tic analysis which covers both readings: the
reprise is analysed syntactically as an in-situ
interrogative, and semantically as a question
which takes as its propositional content the
perceived content of the previous utterance
being clarified. As conversational move type
(CMT) is integrated into utterance content
by their HPSG grammar (see (Ginzburg et
al., 2001b)) this straightforwardly gives rise
to a reading along the lines of &amp;quot;For which
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.779052">
X are you asking/asserting/(etc.) Y about
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991789">
X?&amp;quot;. They give a full derivation for this read-
ing based on the xos dialogue context frame-
work (Ginzburg, 1996; Bohlin (Ljunglof) et
al., 1999).
This analysis is then extended to two el-
liptical forms: reprise sluices and elliptical
literal reprises. Sluices are elliptical wh-
constructions (see (Ross, 1969)) — short wh-
questions which receive a &amp;quot;sentential&amp;quot; inter-
pretation, in this case an interpretation as a
reprise question, as shown in example (4):
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.36404575">
Did Jill phone?
WHo?
(4) (non-elliptical equivalent:
Did WHo phone?)

<bodyText confidence="0.967616333333333">
Elliptical literal reprises are short polar
questions — bare fragments which receive an
interpretation as a polar reprise question:

They argue that the content of both read-
ings &amp;quot;contains as a constituent the illocu-
Resolution of these elliptical forms is
achieved by allowing a conversational partici-
pant to coerce a clarification question onto the
list of questions under discussion (QUD) in
the current dialogue context. This allows el-
lipsis resolution in the manner of of (Ginzburg
et al., 2001a) to give essentially the same
reading as reprise questions.
(Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001) (hereafter
G&amp;C) give more detailed analysis for the bare
fragment form (therein described as clarifi-
cation ellipsis) and also give a further read-
ing for this form. They call this reading the
constituent reading to distinguish it from the
clausal reading described above. This con-
stituent reading involves querying the con-
tent of a constituent which the CR initiator
has been unable to ground in context (see
(Traum, 1994; Clark, 1996)), and is along the
lines of &amp;quot;What/who/(etc.) is the reference of
your utterance X?&amp;quot;.
A possible lexical identification reading is
also discussed, but no analysis given. They
also raise the issue of whether these specific
readings really exist or could be subsumed
by a single vague reading, but give evidence
that this is not the case: they cite examples
of CR misunderstanding leading to repeated
attempts to elicit the desired clarificational
information, showing that a specific reading
was intended; they also point out that some
readings involve different parallelism condi-
tions. As will be discussed in detail below,
the results of the work described here also in-
dicate that particular forms may be restricted
to particular sets of specific readings.

2 Clarification Forms

The following forms have been identified as
possible means for CRs. While we cannot
claim that this list is exhaustive, a markup
scheme based on these forms has been shown
to cover the CRs encountered in a corpus of
dialogue, as detailed in section 4 below. In
this section we list the forms identified, and
illustrate them with examples. All examples
have been taken from the British National
Corpus (BNC).

quested by the CR initiator is spelt out for the
addressee. Utterances of this type thus often
contain phrases such as &amp;quot;do you mean... &amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;did you say... &amp;quot;, as can be seen in exam-
ples (6) and (7).
Cassie: You did get off with him?
Catherine: Twice, but it was totally
non-existent kissing so

2.2 Reprise Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965074428571429">
Speakers can form a CR by echoing or repeat-
ing5 a previous utterance in full, as shown in
example (8). This form corresponds to G&amp;S&apos;s
reprise interrogative.
Orgady: I spoke to him on Wednes-
day, I phoned him.
Obina: You phoned him?
Orgady: Phoned him.
This form appears to be divisible into
two sub-categories, literal (as in example (8)
above) and wh-substituted reprise sentences,
as illustrated by example (9).

substituted reprise sentence &amp;quot;You&apos;re opening

sluice &amp;quot;(Your own) what?&amp;quot;. The actual form
employed in this case appears closer to the
sluice and was classified as such.10

10While the current exercise has not highlighted it
as an issue, we note that a similar continuum might be

One approach in the face of this indeterminacy might
be to conflate these forms — further analysis of the
results given in this paper may indicate whether this
is desirable.

2.5 Gaps

<bodyText confidence="0.999448571428571">
The gap form differs from the reprise forms
described above in that it does not involve a
reprise component corresponding to the com-
ponent being clarified. Instead, it consists of
a reprise of (a part of) the utterance imme-
diately preceding this component — see exam-
ple (14).

Our intuition is that this form is intonation-
ally distinct from the reprise fragment form
that it might be taken to resemble. This ap-
pears to be backed up by the fact that no
misunderstandings of gap-CRs were discov-
ered during our corpus analysis.

The filler form is used by a speaker to fill
a gap left by a previous incomplete utter-
ance. Its use therefore appears to be re-
stricted to such contexts, either because a pre-
vious speaker has left an utterance &amp;quot;hanging&amp;quot;
(as in example (15)) or because the CR ini-
tiator interrupts.

3 Clarification Readings
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994614">
This section presents the readings that
have been identified, together with ex-
amples. We follow G&amp;C&apos;s proposed
clausal/constituent/lexical split, with an
added reading for corrections.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959734">
3.1 Clausal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825346153846">
The clausal reading takes as the basis for
its content the content of the conversational
move made by the utterance being clarified.
This reading corresponds roughly to &amp;quot;Are
you asking/asserting that X?&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;For which
X are you asking/asserting that X?&amp;quot;. It fol-
lows that the source utterance must have been
partially grounded by the CR initiator, at
least to the extent of understanding the move
being made.
An attribute-value matrix (AVM) skeleton
for the semantic content of an HPSG sign
corresponding to this reading (according to
G&amp;C&apos;s analysis) is shown below as AVM [1].
It represents a question16, the propositional
content of which is the conversational move
made by the source utterance (shown here as
being of type illoc(utionary)-rel(ation) pos-
sible subtypes include assert, ask) together
with the message associated with that move
(e.g. the proposition being asserted). The pa-
rameter set being queried can be either a con-
stituent of that message (as would be the case
in a sluice or wh-substituted form, where the
CR question is the wh-question &amp;quot;For which X
are you asserting... &amp;quot;) or empty (as would be

G&amp;S, wherein questions are represented as semantic
objects comprising a set of parameters (empty for a
polar question) and a proposition. This is the feature-
structure counterpart of a A-abstract wherein the pa-
rameters are abstracted over the proposition.

3.2 Constituent

<bodyText confidence="0.998573923076923">
Another possible reading is a constituent
reading whereby the content of a constituent
of the previous utterance is being clarified.
This reading corresponds roughly to
&amp;quot;What/who is X?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What/who do you
mean by X?&amp;quot;, as shown in AVM [2], a descrip-
tion of the content that would be given by
G&amp;C&apos;s analysis. This shows a question whose
propositional content is the relation between
a sign (a constituent of the source utterance),
its speaker, and the intended semantic con-
tent. The abstracted parameter is the con-
tent.

3.3 Lexical
</subsectionHeader>

Another possibility appears to be a lexical
reading. This is closely related to the clausal
reading, but is distinguished from it in that
the surface form of the utterance is being clar-
ified, rather than the content of the conversa-
tional move.
This reading therefore takes the form &amp;quot;Did
you utter X?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What did you utter?&amp;quot;. The
CR initiator is attempting to identify or con-
firm a word in the source utterance, rather
than a part of the semantic content of the
utterance. This poses some interesting ques-
tions if a full analysis for this reading is to
be integrated into the HPSG framework de-
scribed above.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998355">
4.1 Aims and Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970724137931">
Our intention was to investigate the forms
and readings for CRs that are present in a cor-
pus of dialogue. For this purpose we used the
BNC, which contains a 10 million word sub-
corpus of English dialogue transcripts. For
this experiment, a sub-portion of the dialogue
transcripts was used consisting of c. 150,000
words. To maintain a spread across dialogue
domain, region, speaker age etc., this sub-
portion was created by taking a 200-speaker-
turn section from 59 transcripts.
All CRs within this sub-corpus were iden-
tified and tagged, using the markup scheme
and decision process described in 4.2 and 4.3
below. At time of writing this process has
been performed by only one (expert) user —
our intention is to confirm results by compar-
ing with those obtained by naive users, using
e.g. the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) to
assess reliability.
Initial identification of CRs was performed
using SCoRE (Purver, 2001), a search engine
developed specifically for this purpose (in par-
ticular, to allow searches for repeated words
between speaker turns, and to display dia-
logue in an intuitive manner). However, in
order to ensure that all clarificational phe-
nomena were captured, the final search and
markup were performed manually.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990945">
4.2 Markup Scheme

The markup scheme used evolved during the
markup process as new CR mechanisms were
identified, and the final scheme was as de-
scribed here. A multi-layered approach was

clausal, constituent or lexical sub-type, so this may in
fact not be a separate reading but a particular usage
of those already established. In this case corrections
may be covered by the analyses given for other read-
ings above, with a modified QUD coercion operation

taken, along the lines of the DAMSL dialogue
act markup scheme (Allen and Core, 1997) —
this allowed sentences to be marked indepen-
dently for three attributes: form, reading and
source.
The form and reading attributes had fi-
nite sets of possible values. The possible val-
ues were as described in sections 2 and 3,
plus an extra catch-all category other to deal
with any otherwise uncategorisable phenom-
ena. The source attribute could take any in-
teger value and was set to the number of the
sentence that was being clarified (according
to the BNC sentence-numbering scheme).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.90768">
4.3 Decision Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989058037037037">
Following the methods described in (Allen
and Core, 1997), binary decision trees were
designed to guide the classification process.
The trees are designed so that a naive user can
follow them, but have yet to be tested in this
way. Trees were produced for initial identifi-
cation of a CR, for classification of CR form
and for determination of CR source. Due to
space restrictions, the trees are not given here.
In the (common) case of ambiguity of read-
ing, the response(s) of other dialogue par-
ticipants were examined to determine which
reading was chosen by them. The ensuing re-
action of the CR initiator was then used to
judge whether this interpretation was accept-
able. If the CR initiator gave no reaction,
the reading was assumed to have been accept-
able. The following example (17) shows a case
where the other participant&apos;s initial (clausal)
reading was incorrect (the initiator is not sat-
isfied), as a constituent reading was required.
In such cases, both CRs were marked as con-
stituent.

The BNC&apos;s SGML markup scheme (see
(Burnard, 2000) for details) allows sub-
corpora to be easily identified according to do-
main. This allowed us to collate results both
over all dialogue domains20, and restricted
to dialogue identified as demographic (non-
context-governed).
The distribution of CRs by form and read-
ing are shown in full in table 1 (all dialogue
domains) and table 2 (demographic only).
The distributions are presented as percent-
ages of all CRs found. This allows us to
see the proportion made up by each form
and each reading, together with any correla-
tions between form and reading, as discussed
in full below. Distributions are similar over
both sets, indicating that corpus size is large
enough to give repeatable results.
Separation between CR and source sen-
tence is shown in table 3 and figure 1, and
is discussed below.

graphic portion, or just under 3% when cal-
culated over all domains. This is a significant
proportion, giving support to our claim that
processing of CRs is important for a dialogue
system.
The most common forms of CR can be seen
to be the conventional and reprise fragment
forms, with each making up over 25% of CRs.
Non-reprise CRs and reprise sluices are also
common, each contributing over 10% of CRs.
Other forms are all around 5% or less.
Nearly 50% of CRs can be successfully
interpreted as having a clausal reading, al-
though both the lexical (about 35%) and con-
stituent (about 15%) readings also make up a
significant proportion.
This initially suggests that an automated
dialogue system which can deal with frag-
ments, sluices and reprise sentences (the anal-
yses described in section 1), together with
conventional and non-reprise CRs, could give
reasonable coverage of expected dialogue.
Fillers and especially gaps make up only a
small proportion.
However, the high proportion of lexical
readings suggests that a detailed analysis of
this phenomenon will be required.

4.4.2 Coverage
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942611111111">
The coverage of the corpus by the forms
and readings listed in this paper is good, with
only 0.5% of CR readings (2 sentences) and
about 1.5% of CR forms (6 sentences) being
classified as other.
The readings not covered were all express-
ing surprise, amusement or outrage at a pre-
vious utterance (rather than requesting clar-
ification directly), and were all of the reprise
fragment or conventional form. Our intuition
is that these readings can be treated as clausal
readings with a further level of illocutionary
force given by use in context.
Of the 2 sentences left unclassified for form,
one appears to be an unusual conventional
reading, and one an interesting example of a
literal reprise of an unuttered but implied sen-
tence.

4.4.3 Form/Reading Correlation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998188">
It appears that of the non-conventional
reprise forms, only the reprise fragment re-
quires an analysis that gives a constituent
reading. Even then, this reading is much
less common than the clausal reading, and
we intend further investigation into this fact.
Sluices and reprise sentences appear always to
be satisfactorily interpretable by a clausal or
lexical reading. 21
As few examples of the rarer forms were
observed, it would be dangerous to attempt to
draw any firm conclusions about the readings
they can carry. We can, however, tentatively
suggest that the gap and filler forms might
only be used with a lexical reading. 22
One conclusion that can be safely drawn
is that many readings are available for some
forms (for example, the reprise fragment form
which appears to allow all readings). This
implies that disambiguation between readings
will be important for a dialogue system, and
this is an area we are currently examining.
Possibilities for sources of information that
could be used for disambiguation include di-
alogue context and intonation.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984684210526">
The taxonomy of readings and forms given
in this paper has been shown to cover nearly
99% of CRs within a corpus of dialogue. A
full HPSG analysis has been given elsewhere
for two of the four readings and four of the
eight forms.
Of the remaining readings, we believe that
the lexical reading can be treated by an ex-
tension of the existing analysis. Corrections
will need further research but make up only a
small proportion of CRs.
Of the remaining forms, we believe that two
(non-reprise and conventional) can be accom-
modated relatively smoothly within our cur-
rent HPSG framework. Gaps and fillers, how-
ever, present a significant challenge and will
be the subject of future research.
The measurements of CSS distance show
that an utterance record with length of the
order of ten sentences would be sufficient to
allow a dialogue system to process the vast
majority of CRs.
We are in the process of implement-
ing our existing analyses for the CR
forms and readings described above within
a HPSG/TrindiKit-based dialogue system
which incorporates the ellipsis resolution ca-
pability of SHARDS (Ginzburg et al., 2001a)
and the dialogue move engine of GoDiS (Lars-
son et al., 2000). At time of writing, the sys-
tem can successfully produce both clausal and
constituent readings. As a result of the re-
search outlined in this paper, a lexical reading
is currently being implemented.
Our results also suggest that investigation
into disambiguation of reading, possibly on
the basis of dialogue information state and/or
intonation, will be required.

To maintain a spread across dialogue domain, region, speaker age etc., this subportion was created by taking a 200-speakerturn section from 59 transcripts. All CRs within this sub-corpus were identified and tagged, using the markup scheme and decision process described in 4.2 and 4.3 below.

The analyses so far proposed require all in(1) formation from a previous utterance to be retained in memory (not only propositional content but syntax and phonology). The retention of such a large amount of information indefinitely poses obvious problems for any implementation with finite resources, and seems at odds with some results from work in psycholinguistics: studies such as (Sachs, 1967; van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983) have argued that surface information such as syntax is retained only in the short term (see (Fletcher, 1994) for an overview).

In other words, B&apos;s utterances in the examples above both involve querying some feature of A&apos;s query.

To maintain a spread across dialogue domain, region, speaker age etc., this subportion was created by taking a 200-speakerturn section from 59 transcripts. All CRs within this sub-corpus were identified and tagged, using the markup scheme and decision process described in 4.2 and 4.3 below. At time of writing this process has been performed by only one (expert) user — our intention is to confirm results by comparing with those obtained by naive users, using e.g. the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) to assess reliability. Initial identification of CRs was performed using SCoRE (Purver, 2001), a search engine developed specifically for this purpose (in particular, to allow searches for repeated words between speaker turns, and to display dialogue in an intuitive manner). However, in order to ensure that all clarificational phenomena were captured, the final search and markup were performed manually. 4.2 Markup Scheme The markup scheme used evolved during the markup process as new CR mechanisms were identified, and the final scheme was as described here.

In this paper we describe an attempt to exhaustively categorise CR forms and readings based on corpus work, and discuss the implications of our results for further analysis. The analyses so far proposed require all in(1) formation from a previous utterance to be retained in memory (not only propositional content but syntax and phonology). The retention of such a large amount of information indefinitely poses obvious problems for any implementation with finite resources, and seems at odds with some results from work in psycholinguistics: studies such as (Sachs, 1967; van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983) have argued that surface information such as syntax is retained only in the short term (see (Fletcher, 1994) for an overview). Our corpus work has therefore had the additional aim of identification of the maximum distance between a CR and the utterance being clarified (the source utterance). In this section we give a brief overview of CR forms identified in previous work, together with the analyses proposed and the readings that these analyses give rise to. In sections 2 and 3 we list the possible CR forms and readings that we have identified from corpus analysis.</context>
