This paper surveys several approaches to semantic-network seman-
tics that have not previously been treated in the Al or
computational -linguistics literature, though there is a large phi lo.
sophical literature investigating them in some detail. In particular.
propositional semantic networks (exemplihed by ti\ePS) .ire dis
cussed. it is argued that only a fully intensional t&amp;quot;Meinongian&amp;quot;)
semantics is appropriate or them, and several Meinongian systems
are presented.

nothing essentially &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; about semantic networks (Hendrix

data structure, it is arguable that a semantic network is a language

As a notational device, a semantic network can itseil he given
a semantics. That is, the arcs, nodes, and rules tit a semantic
network representational system can be given interpretations in
terms of the entities they are used to represent. Without such a
semantics, a semantic network is an arbitrary notational clec,ice
liable to misinterpretation rel. Woods 1975; Brachman i977, 1983;

networks is more akin to the task of providing a semantics for a
language than for a logic, since in the latter case, hut not in the

It seems reasonable that a semantics or such a representational sys-
tem should itself be an intensional semantics. In this paper, I out-
line several fully intensional semantics for intensional semantic
networks by discussing the relations between a semantic-network

countenancing intensional entities, are not fully intensional, since

tional network (see helov.-). It can, however. also he used to
represent the inheritability of properties, either by explicit rules or
by path-based inference (Shapiro 19781. It consists of labeled
nodes and labeled, directed arcs satisfying (inter alia) the following
condition (cf. Maida and Shapiro 1982):
S) There is a 1-1 correspondence hetween nodes and represented
concepts.
A concept is &amp;quot;anything about which information can he stored
and/or transmitted&amp;quot; (Shapiro 1979: 179). When a semantic net-
work such as SNePS is used to model &amp;quot;the belief structure of
thinking. rea.soninv. language using being&amp;quot; (Maida and Shapiro
1982: 296; cf. Shapiro 1971h: 513), the concepts are the obiects of
mental (i.e.. intentional) acts such as thinking. heliev:ng. wishing,
etc. Such ohiects are intensional (cl. Rapaport 1978).
It follows from IS) that the arcs do not represent concepts.
Rather. they represent binary, structural relations between con-
cepts. if it is desired to talk about certain relations between con-
cepts, tnen those relations must he represented by nodes, since they
have then become objects of thought, i.e., concepts. In terms of
Ouine&apos;s dictum that &amp;quot;to be is to be the value of a [bound] variable&amp;quot;
(Quine 1980: 15; cf. Shapiro 1971a: 79-80), nodes represent such
values, arcs do not. That is. given a domain of discourse—including
Items, n arv relations among them, and propositions—S\ePti nodes
would he used to represent all members of the domain. The arcs
are used to structure the items, relations, and piopositions of the
domain into (other) propositions. As an analogy. SNePS arcs are to
SNePS nodes as the symbols and are to the symbols &apos;5&apos;, *NP&apos;,
and &apos;VP&apos; in the rewrite rule: S + VP. It is because no propos&apos;
lions are represented by arcs that SNePS is a &amp;quot;propositional&amp;quot; seman-
tic network (cf. Mala and Shapiro 1982:292).
When a semantic network such as SNePS is used to model a
mind, the nodes represent only intensional items (Maida and
Shapiro 1982; cf. Rapaport 1978). Similarly, if such a network
were to he used as a notation for a fully intensional natural-
language semantics (such as the semantics presented in Rapaport
1981), the nodes would represent only intensional items. Thus, a
semantics for such a network ought itself to he fully intensional.
There are two pairs of types of nodes in SNePS: constant and
variable nodes, and atomic (or individual) and molecular (or propo-
sitional) nodes. (Molecular individual nodes are currently being
implemented: see Sect. 7. 8. For a discussion o1 the semantics of
variable nodes, see Shapiro 1985.) Except for a few pre-defined arcs
for use by an inference package, all arc labels are chosen by the
user; such labels are completely arbitrary (albeit often mnemonic)
and depend on the domain being represented. The &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; of
the labels are provided (by the user) only by means of explicit rule
nodes, w loch allow the retrieval or construction (by inferencing)
of propositional nodes.

3. ISRAEL&apos;S POSSIBLE-WORLDS SEMANTICS FOR SNePS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997180684210526">
David Israel&apos;s semantics for SNePS assumes &amp;quot;the general
framework of Krtpke-Montague style model theoretic accounts&amp;quot;
(Israel 1983: 3), presumably because tie takes it as &amp;quot;quite clear that
(Maida and Shapirtil ... view their formalism .is a Montague type

nodes—are modelled as functions &amp;quot;I root / into the power set ot the

&amp;quot;functions from / into II P.}... although Israel !eels that a &amp;quot;hyper-
intensional&amp;quot; logic would he needed in order to handle propositional
attitudes.
Israel has difficulty interpreting ((ASS. and ISA
arcs in this Iramework. This is to he expected for two reasons.
First, it is arguably a mistake to interpret them (rather than giving
rules tor them), since they ;ire arcs, hence arbitrary and non-
conceptual. Second, a possible-worlds semantics is not the best
approach (nor is It &amp;quot;clear&amp;quot; that this is what Maida and Shapiro had
in mind—indeed, they explicitly reject it: cf. Maida and Shapiro
1982: 297). Israel himself hints at the inappropriateness of this
a ppri Jac h:
if one is focussing on propositional attitudelsl ... it can
seem like a waste of time to introduce model-theoretic ac-
counts of intensionality at all. Thus the air of desperation
about the foregoing attempt ... . (Israel 1983: 5.)
Moreover—and significantly—a possible-worlds approach is mis-
guided if one wants to be able to represent impossible oh,el.ts, as one
should want to if one is doing natural-language semantics (Rapa-
port 1978, 1981: Routley 1979). A fully intensional semantic net-
work demands a fully intensional semantics. The main rival to
Montague-style, possihle-t.vorlds semantics (as well as to its close
kin, situation semantics Marwise and Perry 19610 is Meittangian
semantics.

4. MEINONG&apos;S THEORY OF OBJECTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996957222222222">
A lexius Meinong&apos;s (1904) theory of the ohjects of psychologi-
cal acts is a more appropriate foundation for a semantics of proposi-
tional semantic networks as well as for a natural-language seman-
tics. In brief, Meinting&apos;s theory consists of the following theses (cf.
Rapaport 1976, 1978):
(M1) Thesis of Intentionality: livery mental act (e.g., thinking,
believing, judging, etc.) is &amp;quot;directed&amp;quot; towards an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;.
There are two kinds of Memongian objects: (1) objecta. the
objects of such a mental act as thinking-of, and (2)

objectives, the proposition-like objects of such mental acts as
believing( -that) or knowing(-that). E.g., the object of my act of
thinking of a unicorn is: a unicorn; the object of my act of believ-
ing that the larth is Hat is: the Earth is flat.

<listItem confidence="0.8984409">
(M2) Not every object of thought exists (technically, &amp;quot;has being&amp;quot;).
(M3) It is not self-contradictory to deny, nor tautologous to affirm.
existence of an object of thought.
(M4) Thesis of Aussersein: All objects of thought are ausser-
seiend (&amp;quot;beyond being and non-being&amp;quot;).
For present purposes, Aussersein is most easily explicated as a
domain of quantification for non-existentially-loaded quantifiers,
required by (NI2) and (M3).
(M5) Every object of thought has properties (technically. &amp;quot;Sosein&amp;quot;).
(Mb) Principle of Independence: (M2) and (N15) are not incon-
sistent. (For more discussion. cf. Rapaport 1984c.)
(&apos;orolldry: Even objects of thought that do not exist have
properties.
(N17) Principle of Et eedom of Assumption:
(a) Every set of properties (Sosein) corresponds to an ohiect
if thought.
(hi Every object oi thought can be thought 01 (relatixe to
certain &amp;quot;performance&apos; limitations).
(X18) Some objects of thought are incomplete (1.e.. undetermined
with respect to some properties).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972949142857143">
(M9) The meaning oi every sentence and noun phrase is an object
of thought.
It should be obvious that there is a close relationship between
Meinong&apos;s theory and a fully intensional semantic network like
SNePS. SNel&apos;S itself is much like Aussersein: Shapiro (personal
communication) has said that all nodes are implicitly in the net-
work all the time. In particular. a SNePS base (i.e.. atomic constant)
node represents an objectum, and a SNel&apos;S propositional node
represents an objective. .1&apos;hus, when SNel&apos;S is used as a model of
mind, propositional nodes represent the objectives oF beliefs (a.
Mania and Shapiro 1982. Rapaport and Shapiro 1984. Rapaport
1984b): and when SV.:1&amp;quot;i is used in a natural-language processing
system (cf. Shapiro 1982. Rapaport and Shapiro 1984), individual
nodes represent the meanings of noun phrases and verb phrases, and
propositional nodes represent the meanings of sentences.
Memong&apos;s theory wa.s attacked bv Bertrand Russell on
grounds of inconsistency: (1) According to Meinong, the round
square is both round and square (indeed, this is a tautology): vet,
according to Russell, if it is round. then it !!-: not square. (2)Simi-
lar(y. the existing golden mountain must ha...e .111 three of its
defining properties: being a mountain, heint/ -0,1clen, and existinu:
but, as Russell noted. it doesn&apos;t exist. WI. Rapaport 1976. 1978 or

There have been several I ormalizations 01 Memongian
theories in recent philosophical literature, each of which overcomes
these problems. In subsequent sections, I briefly describe three of
these and show their relationships to SNePS. (Others, not described
here. include Routley 1979--cf. Rapaport 1984a—and Zalta 1983.)

<bodyText confidence="0.9996845">
On my own reconstruction of Meinong&apos;s theory (Rapaport
1976, 1978—which bears a coincidental resemblance to McCarthy
1979), there are two types of objects: M -ob jects (i.e., the objects of
thought, which are intensional) and actual objects (which are
extensional). There are two modes of predication of properties to
these: M-objects are constituted by properties, and both M- and
actual objects can exemplify properties. For instance, the pen with
which I wrote the manuscript of this paper is an actual object that
exemplifies the property of being white. Right now, when I think
about that pen, the object of my thought is an XI-object that is con-
satiated (in part) by that property. The &apos;sI-object Jan&apos;s pen can be
represented as: &lt;belonging to Jan, being a pen&gt; (or, for short, as:

all &amp;quot;ordinary** properties such as: being red, being round. etc.; the
latter includes such properties as: existing, being impossible. etc.

there is a corresponding nuclear one. For every set of nuclear pro

Parsons&apos;s theory could proxide a semantics for SNePS. though
the use of two types of properties places restrictions on the possible
uses of SNePS. On the other hand. SNePS could be used to represent
Parsons&apos;s theory (though a device would he needed for marking the
distinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties) and, hence.
together with Parsons&apos;s natural language semantics, to provide a
fool for computational linguistics. Fig. h suggests how this might

llector-Ntri CastarTecia&apos;s theory of &amp;quot;guises&amp;quot; (1972. 1975a-c.
1977, 1979, 1980) is a better candidate. It is a fully intensional
theory with one type of object: guises (intensional items
corresponding to sets of properties), and one type of property. More
precisely, there are properties (e.g., being round, being square, being
blue, ... sets of these (called guise cores: e.g.. (being round, being
square}). and an ontic counterpart, c of the detinite-description
operator, which is used to form guises: e.g., cibeing round, being
square} is the round square. Guises can he understood. roughly, as
things-under-a-description, as &amp;quot;facets&amp;quot; of (physical and non-
physical) objects. as &amp;quot;roles&amp;quot; that objects play, or, in general. as
objects of thought.
Guise theory has two modes of predication: internal and
external. In general. the guise c is-internally E. F.g.,
the guise (named by) the round square is-internally only round
and square. The two guises the tallest mountain and Mi. kverest
are related by an external mode of predication called consubstantia-
tion (C*). Consubstantiation is an equivalence relation that is used
in the analyses of (1) external predication, (2) co-reference. and (3)
existence: I.et a = ci... F... I he a guise and let
a[G]=4., c((... F l). Then I I) a is-externally G (in one

It is possible to provide a fully intensional. non-possible-
worlds semantics for SNePS and similar semantic network formal
isms. &apos;I he most straightforward way is to use ‘leinong&apos;s theory of
objects, though this theory has the disadc antage of not being for-
malued. There are several extant formal Nlemongian theories that
can be used, thi:tigh each has certain disadvantages or problems.
Two lines of research are currently hemg Investigated: ( Take
SNePS as is. and provide a new, formal Aleinongian theory for its
semantic: :::aindation. This has not been discussed here, hut the way
to do this should he clear from the possibilities examined above.

ABSTRACT This paper surveys several approaches to semantic-network semantics that have not previously been treated in the Al or literature, though there is a large phi lo. sophical literature investigating them in some detail. In particular. propositional semantic networks (exemplihed by ti\ePS) .ire dis cussed. it is argued that only a fully intensional t&amp;quot;Meinongian&amp;quot;) semantics is appropriate or them, and several Meinongian systems are presented. 1. SEMANTICS OF SEMANTIC NETWORKS. Semantic networks have pros ed to be ii uselul data structure representing inlormation. i.e., representation sys (A better terminology is r epr system; Rapaport and Shapiro 1984, Rapaport 1984W.

Is 19t1o, ( &apos;h. 2: kneale and Isneale 19bb: 232). It has been pointed out that there is nothing essentially &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; about semantic networks (Hendrix but cf. Woods 1975, Brachman 1979). Indeed, viewed structure, it is arguable that a semantic network is a an associated logic or inference mechanism) for representing information about some domain, and, as such, is They have come to he called &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; because ol their ways oh representing the meanlinguistic items. As a notational device, a semantic network can itseil he given a semantics. That is, the arcs, nodes, and rules tit a semantic network representational system can be given interpretations in terms of the entities they are used to represent. Without such a a semantic network is an arbitrary notational liable to misinterpretation rel. Woods 1975; Brachman i977, 1983; McDermott 1981). The task ot providing a semantics for semantic networks is more akin to the task of providing a semantics for a for a in the latter case, hut not in the Fig. 2.

At the same time, computational Untwists and other Al researchers have netwn to recognue the importance (II representing intensional entities (cf. Woods 1975, lirachman 1979, McCarthy 1979, Maida and Shapiro 1982). It seems reasonable that a semantics or such a representational system should itself be an intensional semantics. In this paper, I outline several fully intensional semantics for intensional semantic networks by discussing the relations between a semantic-network &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; I. and several candidates for I. . For I„ I focus on Shapiro&apos;s propositional Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS; Shapiro 1979), l&apos;or which Israel (1983) has offered a possible-worlds semantics. But possible-worlds semantics, while intensional entities, are not since treat intensional entities extensionally.

A SNePS representation for &apos;A person named &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; has the property of being rich.&apos; (see It can, however. also he used to represent the inheritability of properties, either by explicit rules or inference 19781. It consists of labeled and labeled, directed arcs satisfying alia) following condition (cf. Maida and Shapiro 1982): S) There is a 1-1 correspondence hetween nodes and represented concepts. &amp;quot;anything about which information can he stored and/or transmitted&amp;quot; (Shapiro 1979: 179). When a semantic network such as SNePS is used to model &amp;quot;the belief structure of thinking. rea.soninv. language using being&amp;quot; (Maida and Shapiro 1982: 296; cf. Shapiro 1971h: 513), the concepts are the obiects of mental (i.e.. intentional) acts such as thinking. heliev:ng. wishing, etc. Such ohiects are intensional (cl. Rapaport 1978). It follows from IS) that the arcs do not represent concepts. Rather. they represent binary, structural relations between conif it is desired to talk relations between concepts, tnen those relations must he represented by nodes, since they then become of thought, i.e., concepts. In terms of Ouine&apos;s dictum that &amp;quot;to be is to be the value of a [bound] variable&amp;quot; 1980: cf. Shapiro 79-80), nodes represent values, arcs do not. That is. given a domain of discourse—including Items, n arv relations among them, and propositions—S\ePti nodes would he used to represent all members of the domain. The arcs are used to structure the items, relations, and piopositions of the domain into (other) propositions. As an analogy. SNePS arcs are to SNePS nodes as the symbols and are to the symbols &apos;5&apos;, *NP&apos;, and &apos;VP&apos; in the rewrite rule: S + VP. It is because no propos&apos; by arcs that SNePS is a &amp;quot;propositional&amp;quot; semantic network (cf. Mala and Shapiro 1982:292). a semantic network as SNePS is used to model a mind, the nodes represent only intensional items (Maida and 1982; cf. Rapaport Similarly, if such a network to used as a notation for a fully intensional naturallanguage semantics (such as the semantics presented in Rapaport 1981), the nodes would represent only intensional items. Thus, a for such a network ought itself to he fully are two pairs types of nodes in SNePS: constant and variable nodes, and atomic (or individual) and molecular (or propositional) nodes. (Molecular individual nodes are currently being implemented: see Sect. 7. 8. For a discussion o1 the semantics of variable nodes, see Shapiro 1985.) Except for a few pre-defined arcs for use by an inference package, all arc labels are chosen by the user; such labels are completely arbitrary (albeit often mnemonic) depend on the domain being represented. of the labels are provided (by the user) only by means of explicit rule nodes, w loch allow the retrieval or construction (by inferencing) of propositional nodes. 3. ISRAEL&apos;S POSSIBLE-WORLDS SEMANTICS FOR SNePS. David Israel&apos;s semantics for SNePS assumes &amp;quot;the general of Krtpke-Montague style model accounts&amp;quot; (Israel 1983: 3), presumably because tie takes it as &amp;quot;quite clear that (Maida and Shapirtil ... view their formalism .is a Montague type type theoretic, intensional system&amp;quot; (Israel 1983: 21. Ile introduces domain /) a non empty set / ( ol ble wor)dsl„ind ... a distinguished element wci / to represent real world&amp;quot; (Israel 1983: .1). An al I uric / Each constant individual SNePS node is modeled an ic; variable tnclicidual nodes are handled relative to such a model&amp;quot;. llowecer, predicates—which. the reader should recall, are also represented in e1&amp;quot;; by constant individual nodes—are modelled as functions &amp;quot;I root / into the power set ot the set ol individual concepts&amp;quot; Propwitional nodes are modelled by from / into II although Israel !eels that a &amp;quot;hyperintensional&amp;quot; logic would he needed in order to handle propositional attitudes. Israel has difficulty interpreting ((ASS. and ISA arcs in this Iramework. This is to he expected for two reasons. it is arguably a mistake to (rather than giving rules tor them), since they ;ire arcs, hence arbitrary and non- Second, a possible-worlds semantics best approach (nor is It &amp;quot;clear&amp;quot; that this is what Maida and Shapiro had in mind—indeed, they explicitly reject it: cf. Maida and Shapiro 297). himself hints at the inappropriateness of this a ppri Jac h: focussing on propositional attitudelsl ... it can seem like a waste of time to introduce model-theoretic accounts of intensionality at all. Thus the air of desperation about the foregoing attempt ... . (Israel 1983: 5.) significantly—a is misif one wants to be able to represent oh,el.ts, one to if one is doing natural-language semantics (Rapaport 1978, 1981: Routley 1979). A fully intensional semantic network demands a fully intensional semantics. The main rival to Montague-style, possihle-t.vorlds semantics (as well as to its close situation semantics Marwise and Perry is semantics. 4. MEINONG&apos;S THEORY OF OBJECTS. A lexius Meinong&apos;s (1904) theory of the ohjects of psychological acts is a more appropriate foundation for a semantics of propositional semantic networks as well as for a natural-language semantics. In brief, Meinting&apos;s theory consists of the following theses (cf. Rapaport 1976, 1978): of Intentionality: mental act (e.g., thinking, believing, judging, etc.) is &amp;quot;directed&amp;quot; towards an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;. are two kinds of Memongian objects: (1) objects of such a mental act as thinking-of, and (2) 44 proposition-like objects of such mental acts as believing( -that) or knowing(-that). E.g., the object of my act of of a unicorn is: unicorn; object of my act of believthat the larth is Hat is: Earth is flat. Not object of thought exists (technically, &amp;quot;has being&amp;quot;). (M3) It is not self-contradictory to deny, nor tautologous to affirm. existence of an object of thought. Thesis of Aussersein: objects of thought are ausserbeing and non-being&amp;quot;). present most easily explicated as a domain of quantification for non-existentially-loaded quantifiers, required by (NI2) and (M3). Every object of thought has properties (technically. of Independence: and (N15) are not inconsistent. (For more discussion. cf. Rapaport 1984c.) objects of thought that do not exist have properties. of Et eedom of Assumption: Every set of properties to an ohiect (hi Every object oi thought can be thought 01 (relatixe to certain &amp;quot;performance&apos; limitations). (X18) Some objects of thought are incomplete (1.e.. undetermined with respect to some properties). (M9) The meaning oi every sentence and noun phrase is an object of thought. It should be obvious that there is a close relationship between Meinong&apos;s theory and a fully intensional semantic network like SNel&apos;S itself is much like (personal said that all nodes are implicitly in the network all the time. In particular. a SNePS base (i.e.. atomic constant) node represents an objectum, and a SNel&apos;S propositional node represents an objective. .1&apos;hus, when SNel&apos;S is used as a model of mind, propositional nodes represent the objectives oF beliefs (a. Mania and Shapiro 1982. Rapaport and Shapiro 1984. Rapaport 1984b): and when SV.:1&amp;quot;i is used in a natural-language processing system (cf. Shapiro 1982. Rapaport and Shapiro 1984), individual nodes represent the meanings of noun phrases and verb phrases, and propositional nodes represent the meanings of sentences. Memong&apos;s theory wa.s attacked bv Bertrand Russell on grounds of inconsistency: (1) According to Meinong, the round square is both round and square (indeed, this is a tautology): vet, to Russell, if it is round. then it !!-: (2)Similar(y. the existing golden mountain must ha...e .111 three of its properties: being a mountain, heint/ and existinu: as Russell noted. it WI. Rapaport 1976. 1978 or references.) have been several I ormalizations 01 theories in recent philosophical literature, each of which overcomes these problems. In subsequent sections, I briefly describe three of these and show their relationships to SNePS. (Others, not described here. include Routley 1979--cf. Rapaport 1984a—and Zalta 1983.) 5. RAPAPORT&apos;S THEORY. own reconstruction of theory (Rapaport 1976, 1978—which bears a coincidental resemblance to McCarthy there are two types of objects: -ob jects the objects of which are intensional) and objects are extensional). There are two modes of predication of properties to M-objects are properties, and both Mand objects can For instance, the pen with which I wrote the manuscript of this paper is an actual object that property of white. now, when I think that pen, the object of my thought is an XI-object that is conpart) by that property. The &apos;sI-object pen be represented as: &lt;belonging to Jan, being a pen&gt; (or, for short, as: P&gt;). a pen also a this v1-object: , and &apos;Jan&apos;s pen is a pen&apos; is true in virtue of this objective. addition. , 1&gt; exemplifies the property of constiby two properties. might be an actual object, say. o, to P &gt;, property of a I&apos;) as well as (say) the property of long. long (t The M-object round square. R.S constituted by two properties: being round ( being square square is round&apos; is in virtue of this, and &apos;The round is not square&apos; is false in virtue of it.

Actual (i.e.. extensional) objects. however. should not be represented (cf. Maida and Shapiro 981. the extent to which such objects are essential to Meinongian theory. the present is perhaps an inapone. (A similar remark holds, of course. McCarthy 1979.) 6. PARSONS&apos;S THEORY. Terence Parsons&apos;s theory of nonexistent objects (1980; cf. Rapaport 1976, 1978, 1985) recognizes only one type of object— ones—and one mode of But it has two 45 Fig. 5. An alternative SNePS representation of &apos;The round square is round&apos;, &apos;The round square is square&apos;, and &apos;The round square is impossible&apos; on Rapaport&apos;s theory. of properties: Ihe includes all &amp;quot;ordinary** properties such as: being red, being round. etc.; the latter includes such properties as: existing, being impossible. etc. But the distinction is blurry, since for each extranuclear property, there is a corresponding nuclear one. For every set of nuclear pro nettles, there is a unique ohiect that has only those properties. Existing oblects must he complete (and. of course, consistent). not all such obiects exist. For instance. Morning Slur Evening Star exist are taken to consist, of only two properties each). round square. course. is (and only is/ both round and square ,ind. so, isn&apos;t non-square; it is. for that reason, impossible. hence not real.

There is, a &amp;quot;watered n&amp;quot;. nuclear Yersion of existence, and there existing golden mountain that has hut the extranuclear property of existence, and, so it doesn&apos;t theory could proxide a semantics for SNePS. the use of two types of properties places restrictions on the possible uses of SNePS. On the other hand. SNePS could be used to represent Parsons&apos;s theory (though a device would he needed for marking the distinction between nuclear and extranuclear properties) and, hence. together with Parsons&apos;s natural language semantics, to provide a for computational linguistics. h suggests how this might he done. Fig. 6. A SNePS representation of &apos;The round square is round, square, and impossible&apos; on Parsons&apos;s theory. CASTAREDA&apos;S llector-Ntri CastarTecia&apos;s theory of &amp;quot;guises&amp;quot; (1972. 1975a-c. 1977, 1979, 1980) is a better candidate.

The &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; of the labels are provided (by the user) only by means of explicit rule nodes, w loch allow the retrieval or construction (by inferencing) of propositional nodes. 3. ISRAEL&apos;S POSSIBLE-WORLDS SEMANTICS FOR SNePS. David Israel&apos;s semantics for SNePS assumes &amp;quot;the general framework of Krtpke-Montague style model theoretic accounts&amp;quot; (Israel 1983: 3), presumably because tie takes it as &amp;quot;quite clear that (Maida and Shapirtil ... view their formalism .is a Montague type type theoretic, intensional system&amp;quot; (Israel 1983: 21.

Second, a possible-worlds semantics is not the best approach (nor is It &amp;quot;clear&amp;quot; that this is what Maida and Shapiro had in mind—indeed, they explicitly reject it: cf. Maida and Shapiro 1982: 297). Israel himself hints at the inappropriateness of this a ppri Jac h: if one is focussing on propositional attitudelsl ... it can seem like a waste of time to introduce model-theoretic accounts of intensionality at all. Thus the air of desperation about the foregoing attempt ... . (Israel 1983: 5.) Moreover—and significantly—a possible-worlds approach is misguided if one wants to be able to represent impossible oh,el.ts, as one should want to if one is doing natural-language semantics (Rapaport 1978, 1981: Routley 1979). A fully intensional semantic network demands a fully intensional semantics. The main rival to Montague-style, possihle-t.vorlds semantics (as well as to its close kin, situation semantics Marwise and Perry 19610 is Meittangian semantics. 4. MEINONG&apos;S THEORY OF OBJECTS.

WI. Rapaport 1976. 1978 or references.) There have been several I ormalizations 01 Memongian theories in recent philosophical literature, each of which overcomes these problems. In subsequent sections, I briefly describe three of these and show their relationships to SNePS. (Others, not described here. include Routley 1979--cf. Rapaport 1984a—and Zalta 1983.) 5. RAPAPORT&apos;S THEORY. On my own reconstruction of Meinong&apos;s theory (Rapaport 1976, 1978—which bears a coincidental resemblance to McCarthy 1979), there are two types of objects: M -ob jects (i.e., the objects of thought, which are intensional) and actual objects (which are extensional). There are two modes of predication of properties to these: M-objects are constituted by properties, and both M- and actual objects can exemplify properties. For instance, the pen with which I wrote the manuscript of this paper is an actual object that exemplifies the property of being white. Right now, when I think about that pen, the object of my thought is an XI-object that is consatiated (in part) by that property. The &apos;sI-object Jan&apos;s pen can be re</context>

A lexius Meinong&apos;s (1904) theory of the ohjects of psychological acts is a more appropriate foundation for a semantics of propositional semantic networks as well as for a natural-language semantics. In brief, Meinting&apos;s theory consists of the following theses (cf. Rapaport 1976, 1978): (M1) Thesis of Intentionality: livery mental act (e.g., thinking, believing, judging, etc.) is &amp;quot;directed&amp;quot; towards an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;. There are two kinds of Memongian objects: (1) objecta. the objects of such a mental act as thinking-of, and (2) 44 objectives, the proposition-like objects of such mental acts as believing( -that) or knowing(-that). E.g., the object of my act of thinking of a unicorn is: a unicorn; the object of my act of believing that the larth is Hat is: the Earth is flat.
