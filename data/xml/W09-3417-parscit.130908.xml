TimeML, TimeBank, and TTK (TARSQI
Project) have been playing an important role
in enhancement of IE, QA, and other NLP
applications. TimeML is a specification lan-
guage for events and temporal expressions in
text. This paper presents the problems and so-
lutions for porting TimeML to Korean as a
part of the Korean TARSQI Project. We also
introduce the KTTK which is an automatic
markup tool of temporal and event-denoting
expressions in Korean text.

The TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reason-
ing systems for QA) Project1 aims to develop
technology for annotation, extraction, and rea-
soning of temporal information in natural lan-
guage text. The main result of the TARSQI Pro-
ject consists of TimeML (Pustejovsky et. al.,
2003), TimeBank (Pustejovsky et. al., 2006), and
TARSQI Toolkit (TTK, Verhagen and Puste-
jovsky, 2008). TimeML is a specification lan-
guage for events and temporal expressions in text.
TimeBank is an annotated corpus which was
made as a proof of the TimeML specification.
TTK is an automatic system to extract events and
time expressions, creating temporal links be-
tween them2.
TimeML is an ISO standard of a temporal
markup language and has been being extended to
other languages such as Italian, Spanish, Chinese,

etc. (ISO/DIS 24617-1: 2008). TempEval-2, a
task for the Semeval-2010 competition, has been
proposed (Pustejovsky et. al. 2008). The task for
the TempEval-2 is evaluating events, time ex-
pressions, and temporal relations. Data sets will
be provided for English, Italian, Spanish, Chi-
nese, and Korean.
The necessity of temporal and event expres-
sions markup for any robust performance such as
QA (for Korean QA system, refer to Han et. al.,
2004), IE, or summarization is applied to Korean
NLP applications as well. Recently, there have
been TimeML-related studies for Korean: Jang et.
al (2004) show an automatic annotation system
of temporal expressions with Timex2 in Korean
text. Lee (2008) argues about the semantics of
Korean TimeML, specially the EVENT tag. Im
and Saurí (2008) focus on the problems of Ti-
meML application to Korean caused by typo-
logical difference between English and Korean.
Motivated by them, the Korean TARSQI Project3
started with the purpose of making TimeML,
TimeBank and TTK for Korean text4.
Porting TimeML to other languages can be
challenging because of typological difference
between languages. In this paper, we present the
problems for TimeML application to Korean.
Our solution is to change TimeML markup phi-
losophy: a change from word-based in-line anno-
tation to morpheme-based stand-off annotation.
Based on the changed annotation philosophy, we
decide how to annotate temporal and event-
denoting expressions in Korean text. More spe-
cifically, it is challenging to decide whether we
use LINK tags or attributes to annotate some

TimeML features four major data structures:
EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK. The
EVENT tag encodes event-denoting expressions.
The TIMEX3 tag annotates temporal expressions
of different sorts: fully specified dates, times,
and durations, or just partially specified dates,
times, and durations. The SIGNAL tag annotates
elements that indicate how temporal objects are
related among them (e.g., subordinating connec-
tors such as when or after).
The LINK tag splits into three main types: (a)
TLINK, which encodes temporal relations among
EVENTs and TIMEX3s; (b) ALINK, representing
aspectual information as expressed between an
aspectual predicate and its embedded event; and

conveying evidentiality (e.g. Mary said [she
bought some wine]), factivity (John regretted
[Mary bought wine]), or intensionality (Kate
thought [Mary bought beer]).

<bodyText confidence="0.9965106">
Information relevant to each tag is character-
ized by means of attribute-value pairs (refer to
Pustejovsky et. al. 2003 about specific attributes-
value pairs). (1) illustrates an annotated sentence

Sentence (1) presents three EVENT expressions
(said, began, and work). SLINK conveys an evi-
dential relation between e1 (said) and e2 (began).
Korean is an agglutinative language whose
words are formed by joining morphemes to-
gether, where an affix typically represents one
unit of meaning and bound morphemes are ex-
pressed by affixes. For example, the sentence
John-i emeni-kkeyse o-si-ess-ta-te-ra ‘John-Nom
mother-Nom come-Hon-Past-Quo-Ret-Dec 5 ’
means that (I heard) (John said) that his mother
came. Each morpheme has its own functional
meaning or content.
As shown above, consideration of morphemes
is important for TimeML markup of Korean text.
Here, we summarize TimeML-related character-
istics of Korean:
(i) In Korean, functional markers (tense, aspect,
mood, modality, etc.) are represented morphologically.
English as an isolating language uses periphrastic
conjugation to represent functional categories.
(e.g. ‘-keyss-’is a conjectural modal morpheme in pi-
ka o-keyss-ta ‘it will rain’. While, ‘will’ is an auxil-
iary verb in it will rain.)
(ii) Some subordination is realized morphologically
via morpheme contraction.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.6474392">
(e.g. ‘-ta-n-ta’ is a morphological contraction which
denotes quotation in the sentence John-i nayil o-n-ta-
n-ta ‘John-Nom tomorrow come-Pres-Dec.Quo-Pres-
Dec’. Its English counterpart is represented by subor-
dination: John said that he will come tomorrow)
</construct>
<tableCaption confidence="0.706920466666667">
(iii) Some connectives in English correspond to mor-
phemes in Korean.
(e.g. Korean counterpart of the English connective
‘and’ in I ate milk and went to sleep is the morpheme
‘-ko’ in the sentence na-nun wuyu-rul masi-ko ca-re
ka-ss-ta ‘I-Top milk-Acc drink-and sleep-ending go-
Past-Dec’)
(iv) The sentence type of English is represented by
word order but that of Korean by ending morphemes
(e.g. Declarative: pi-ka o-n-ta ‘it is raining’ interroga-
tive: pi-ka o-ni? ‘Is it raining?’)
5 Nom: nominative case, Hon: honorific morpheme,
Past: past tense morpheme, Quo: quotative mood
morpheme, Ret: retrospective mood morpheme, Dec:
declarative sentence ending

3.2 Basic Issues of Korean TimeML
3.2.1 Morpheme-based standoff annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99796225">
TimeML employs word-based in-line annotation.
It poses a challenge at the representation level,
since it encodes information mainly based on the
structure of the target language, and thus content
equivalences among different languages are hard
to establish. For example, indirect quotation in
Korean offers an example of the mismatch of
linguistic devices employed in different lan-
guages to express the same meaning. Quotation
constructions in English use two predicates, the
reporting and the reported, which TimeML
marks up as independent EVENTs:

&lt;SLINK eventID=”e1” subordinatedE-
vent=”e2”relType=”EVIDENTIAL”/&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.968229172413793">
TimeML uses a subordination link (SLINK) in
order to convey the evidentiality feature that the
reporting predicate projects to the event ex-
pressed by its subordinated argument.
On the other hand, a Korean quotative con-
struction, as in (3), has only one verb stem,
which corresponds to the subordinated predicate
in English. Note that there is no reporting predi-
cate such as say in English. Nevertheless, the
sentence has a reporting interpretation.
(3) John-i ku-ka wine-ul sa-ss-ta-n-ta
J-Nom he-Nom wine-Acc buy-Past-Quo-Pres-Dec
‘John said that he bought some wine’
The quotative expression –ta-n-ta above is a con-
tracted form of –ta-ko malha-n-ta ‘Dec-Quo say-
Pres-Dec’. Although (3) is a simple sentence in-
volving no subordination at the syntactic level,
the two tense markers, ‘-ss-’ and ‘-n-’, are evi-
dence of the existence of an implicit reporting
event. Specifically, the past tense marker ‘-ss-’
applies to the main event here (sa-ss ‘buy-past’),
while the present tense marker ‘-n-’ is under-
stood as applying to the implicit reporting event
(ta-n-ta ‘report-pres-Dec)6.
Constructions presented above show a prob-
lem for the standard TimeML treatment of a Ko-
rean quotative sentence. The relationship be-
tween reporting and reported events is expressed
morphologically, and thus the SLINK mechanism

for word-based annotation is not adaptable here.
Because Korean transfers meanings through
morphological constructions, morpheme-based
annotation is more effective than word-based for
TimeML application to Korean7.
For morpheme-based tagging, we propose
stand-off annotation for Korean because it needs
two-level annotation: the MORPH tag8 and Ti-
meML tags. Standoff annotation separates mor-
phologically-annotated data from primary data
and saves it in a different file, and then TimeML
annotation applies to the data. The following is
the proposed morpheme-based stand-off annota-
tion for (3).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989331740740741">
In (4), we show the example annotation of the
MORPH tag for (3) to help readers to understand
our proposal. Standoff annotation makes it pos-
sible to extract information about two events
without using a non-text consuming EVENT tag.
Moreover, each of the two tense morphemes is
properly assigned to its related event. Our pro-
posed TimeML annotation scheme is composed
of two levels – morphological analysis and Ti-
meML annotation.
7 There can be several ways of annotating morphological
constructions: morpheme-based, morpho-syntactic unit-
based (refer to MAF: Clément and Clergerie, 2005), charac-
ter-based, and bunsetsu-based. At present, we adopt mor-
pheme-based annotation because it seems to be enough to
introduce the required units for KTimeML markup and we
want to avoid the possible redundancy of bunsetsu-based or
morpho-syntactic unit-based annotation. Moreover, the
criterion for separation of a morphological construction is
related with tags such as EVENT, TIMEX3, or attributes like
tense, aspect, mood, or modality in KTimeML, not with
syntactic or phonological information. Standoff annotation
makes it easy to mark up the interval of morphemes. Never-
theless, we consider the possible advantage of morpho-
syntactic analysis positively for future work.
8 The values of the POS attribute are based on a Korean
Part_of_Speech Tag Set version 1.0 (Kim and Seo, 1994).

3.2.2 Surface-based annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967333333333">
KTimeML adopts the surface-based annotation
philosophy of TimeML (Saurí et. al. 2006a),
which does not encode the actual interpretation
of the constructions it marks up, but their gram-
matical features. For example, the leaving event
in the sentence we are leaving tomorrow is not
annotated as expressing a future tense, but as
expressed by means of a present tense form.
Several considerations motivate this surface-
based approach. As an annotation language, it
must guarantee the marking up of corpora in an
efficient and consistent way, ensuring high inter-
annotator agreement. As a representation
scheme, it needs to be used for training and
evaluating algorithms for both temporal informa-
tion extraction and temporal reasoning.
A surface-based approach is the suitable op-
tion for meeting such requirements. Neverthe-
less, it poses a challenge at the representation
level. How to represent evidentiality in Korean
and English shows the challenge.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.972858129032258">
English, as an isolating language, expresses evi-
dentiality in a periphrastic manner. Hence, the
TimeML treatment of these constructions con-
sists in marking the two involved predicates as
EVENTs, and introducing an SLINK between
them. Korean has both periphrastic and morpho-
logical ways for expressing evidentiality. Anno-
tating the periphrastic version with the standard
TimeML treatment poses no problem because it
has two predicates denoting events like its Eng-
lish counterpart. Morphological constructions
however, are harder to handle, because the retro-
spective mood morpheme ‘-te-’ brings about the
implicit reference to a seeing event.
(6) Vietnam-un tep-te-ra
Vietnam-Top hot-Ret-Dec
‘(as I saw) Vietnam was hot’
They are similar to quotative constructions in the
sense that, although there is only one predicate
expressed on the surface, the sentence refers to
more than one event. Unlike quotative construc-
tions, there is no morphological evidence of the
implicit event; e.g. tense or sentence mood
markers independent of those applied to the only
verbal predicate in the sentence. The issue to
consider is therefore whether to treat the eviden-
tial constructions by introducing an EVENT tag
for the retrospective mood marker as in (7) or to
handle them by specifying the evidential value of
the main predicate at the MOOD attribute of its
EVENT tag, as illustrated in (8).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
As in (7), adding an EVENT tag for the retrospec-
tive morpheme corresponds semantically to Eng-
lish-based TimeML. However, it is not surface-
based, because the perception event is an implicit
event entailed by the retrospective morpheme.
While, the annotation in (8) is a surface-based
annotation of the evidential construction which
uses the MOOD attribute for retrospective mood,
thus respects the surface-based philosophy of
TimeML. This is different from the English
counterpart that presents two EVENTs related
with a TLINK signaling their relative temporal
order. KTimeML follows the surface-based an-
notation philosophy of TimeML ((8) here).

3.2.3 Cancellation of the head-only rule
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992597666666667">
TimeML employs the head-only markup policy
in order to avoid problems derived from tagging
discontinuous sequence (e.g. we are not fully
prepared). If the event is expressed by a verbal
phrase, the EVENT tag will be applied only to its
head, which is marked in bold face in the exam-
ples (e.g. has been scrambling, to buy, did not
disclose). However, Korean does not have the
discontinuity problem. See Korean examples:

<bodyText confidence="0.999852111111111">
In the above sentences, ‘-e iss-’ and ‘-ko iss-’ are
respectively perfective and progressive aspect
markers. No word can make discontinuous se-
quence by being embedded into the middle of the
verb phrases. As we saw from the examples, Ko-
rean does not have discontinuity problem in ver-
bal phrases. Thus, KTimeML does not need to
follow the head-only annotation rule. By cancel-
lation of the head-only rule, we annotate various

<bodyText confidence="0.999619882352941">
Based on the proposed annotation principles of
KTimeML, we present the specification of the
first version of KTimeML (KTimeML 1.1) with
changed tags, attributes, and their values. We
assume that the MORPH-tagged data are sepa-
rately saved in a different file. KTimeML con-
tains EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK tags.
Some new attributes such as mood and sType
are added to the attributes of the EVENT tag. The
other tags have no changes from the TimeML
tags9.
KTimeML 1.1 adds the attributes of predi-
cate_content (pred), mood, verb_form (vForm),
and sentence type (sType) to the attributes of
EVENT in TimeML (For Korean grammar, refer
to Sohn, 1999, Nam and Ko, 2005). The BNF of

KTimeML puts the semantic content of EVENT-
tagged expressions for international communica-
tion. Because mood is not an important gram-
matical category for English, TimeML does not

cal constructions in the specific texts is not trivial.

markup a mood attribute, but KTimeML adds the
mood attribute since there are morphemes that
express mood like many other languages. Unlike
English, different sentence ending morphemes
represent sentence types in Korean. Hence,
KTimeML adds sType to attributes of the
EVENT tag. We put vForm to distinguish be-
tween different subordinated clauses10.
Event classes in KTimeML are the same as
TimeML. Korean tense system does not have
distinction between present and future unlike
English, and thus the tense attribute has PAST
and NONE values. We add DURATIVE to aspect
attribute values in KTimeML for the durative
expression such as combination of stative verb +
progressive aspect marker (e.g. al-ko iss-ta
‘know-durative-Dec’).
For mood, KTimeML 1.1 puts the retrospective
mood (‘-te-‘). The values of vForm attribute are
S_FINAL, CONNECTIVE, and NOMINALIZED,
and ADNOMINAL. The sentence types in Korean
are DECLARATIVE, INTEROGGATIVE, IM-
PERATIVE, and PROPOSITIVE (e.g. cip-ey ka-ca
‘Let’s go home’). KTimeML puts CONJEC-
TURAL (e.g. nayil pi-ka o-keyss-ta ‘(I guess) It
will rain tomorrow’) as a modality value and de-
fault is NONE. The sentence in (10) is an inter-
esting example that includes all attributes of an

Although the BNF of TIMEX3 in Korean Ti-
meML is same as that of TimeML, we point out
that Korean time expressions also have the issue
of how to treat morphological representations of
temporal meaning. For example, pwuthe ‘from’
and kkaci ‘to’ in 3ilpwuthe 5ilkkaci ‘From 3rd to
5th’ both are the counterparts of prepositions in
English (Jang et. al., 2004). We do not tag tem-
poral morphemes as SIGNALs, in principle. In-
stead, we mark up 3ilpwuthe ‘from 3rd’ with one
TIMEX3 tag. However, temporal connectives
such as ttay ‘when’ in ku-ka o-ass-ul ttay young-
hee-nun ttena-ss-ta ‘When he came, Younghee
left’ are tagged as SIGNALs.
SIGNAL is used to annotate sections of text -
typically function words - that indicate how tem-
poral objects are to be related to each other. It
includes temporal connectives (e.g. ttay ‘when’,
tongan ‘during’), and temporal noun (e.g. hwu
‘after’, cen ‘before’). See the BNF of SIGNAL

At first, the normalization of the raw document is
done in the preprocessor module. Here the raw
text is separated into sentences, wide characters
are substituted by regular characters, punctuation
symbols are normalized (specially quotation
marks), sino-korean characters (hanja) are
transcribed in hangul, and, the encoding is also
normalized to unicode.
The next module is called Pykts (Python
Wrapper for KTS). Here, sentences are parsed in
order to get their morphological components,
which is achieved by means of a program called
KTS. With the exception of this morphological
parser, which was programmed in C, all the other
components of our project are being written in
Python in order to achieve good results in less

composed by a hyerarchical data structure of

The Event Tagger consists of three modules: a
preprocessor where the chunking of Time

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947111111111">
Temporal and event information extraction is an
important step for QA and other inference or
temporal reasoning systems. Korean TARSQI
Project aims at (1) making KTimeML; (2) build-
ing Korean TimeBank as a gold standard, and (3)
developing KTTK as an automatic markup tool of
temporal and event expressions in Korean text.
In this paper, we presented problems in port-
ing TimeML to Korean and proposed changes of
TimeML philosophy. Since consideration of
morphological issues is a basic step for KTi-
meML, we introduce a morpheme-based two-
level stand-off annotation scheme. We adopt the
surface-based annotation of TimeML, but do not
follow the head-only annotation.
The tags of KTimeML are EVENT, TIMEX3,
TLINK, ALINK, and SLINKs. The morphological
annotation is saved as separate data. The EVENT
tag has the attributes such as vForm, sType,
mood, and modality in addition to the attrib-
utes of TimeML. We showed the architecture of
KTTK.
This work will be a help for QA, IE, and other
robust performance for Korean. In addition,
KTimeML will be, hopefully, a model for port-
ing TimeML to other agglutinative languages
such as Japanese.

Recently, there have been TimeML-related studies for Korean: Jang et. al (2004) show an automatic annotation system of temporal expressions with Timex2 in Korean text. Lee (2008) argues about the semantics of Korean TimeML, specially the EVENT tag.

Moreover, the criterion for separation of a morphological construction is related with tags such as EVENT, TIMEX3, or attributes like tense, aspect, mood, or modality in KTimeML, not with syntactic or phonological information. Standoff annotation makes it easy to mark up the interval of morphemes. Nevertheless, we consider the possible advantage of morphosyntactic analysis positively for future work. 8 The values of the POS attribute are based on a Korean Part_of_Speech Tag Set version 1.0 (Kim and Seo, 1994). 117 3.2.2 Surface-based annotation KTimeML adopts the surface-based annotation philosophy of TimeML (Saurí et. al. 2006a), which does not encode the actual interpretation of the constructions it marks up, but their grammatical features. For example, the leaving event in the sentence we are leaving tomorrow is not annotated as expressing a future tense, but as expressed by means of a present tense form. Several considerations motivate this surfacebased approach. As an annotation language, it must guarantee the marking up of corpora in an efficient and consistent way, ensuring high interannota</context>

TimeML is a specification language for events and temporal expressions in text. TimeBank is an annotated corpus which was made as a proof of the TimeML specification. TTK is an automatic system to extract events and time expressions, creating temporal links between them2. TimeML is an ISO standard of a temporal markup language and has been being extended to other languages such as Italian, Spanish, Chinese, 1 Refer to www.timeml.org for details on the TARSQI. 2 TTK contains GUTime (TIMEX3 tagging, Mani and Wilson, 2000), Evita (event extraction, Saurí et. al., 2005), Slinket (modal parsing, Saurí et. al., 2006b), S2T, Blinker, Classifier, Sputlink, Link Merger, etc. etc. (ISO/DIS 24617-1: 2008). TempEval-2, a task for the Semeval-2010 competition, has been proposed (Pustejovsky et. al. 2008). The task for the TempEval-2 is evaluating events, time expressions, and temporal relations. Data sets will be provided for English, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean.

This paper presents the problems and solutions for porting TimeML to Korean as a part of the Korean TARSQI Project. We also introduce the KTTK which is an automatic markup tool of temporal and event-denoting expressions in Korean text. 1 Introduction The TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reasoning systems for QA) Project1 aims to develop technology for annotation, extraction, and reasoning of temporal information in natural language text. The main result of the TARSQI Project consists of TimeML (Pustejovsky et. al., 2003), TimeBank (Pustejovsky et. al., 2006), and TARSQI Toolkit (TTK, Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008).
