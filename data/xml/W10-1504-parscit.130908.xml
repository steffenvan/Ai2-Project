<bodyText confidence="0.999735708333333">
This is a preliminary report of the results of a new
procedure for building a webcorpus of academic
writing using BootCaT seeded searches (Baroni
and Bernardini, 2004). The procedure inverts the
usual one of finding text-internal traits that corre-
late with externally defined corpora and subcorpo-
ra (Lee, 2001). Instead, we seek words and lexical
bundles so distinctive of a text-type (“register”)
that they will induce BootCaT to download texts of
that type and no other. In the initial phase, a list of
search seed terms is developed to download aca-
demic texts; in the second phase, this procedure is
refined to increase its resolution, developing search
seeds that can bring in texts belonging to sub-types
such as Science and Technology, Arts and Human-
ities, History and Political Science, and so on.
One might object that this is a solution to a non-
problem: that all that is necessary is to limit
searches to the .edu and .ac.uk domains to
search for academic web texts, at least for US and
UK academics. It will become clear, however, that
quite a number of qualifying texts can be found else-
where in other web domains such as .org, .gov,
and even .com.

2.1 Academic writing:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999137">
Academic writing is very much a commonsense
(or “folk”) category. There is considerable agree-
ment that it has research articles and books for dis-
ciplinary audiences at its core, but how much more
beyond that is in question. This study will draw on
three corpus-based studies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987131777777778">
• Coxhead&apos;s Academic Word List (AWL; 2000)
is drawn from a corpus of 3.5 million words of
running text in 441 samples. It is sorted into four
equally represented domains (Arts, Commerce,
Law, and Science). AWL gives lists of key aca-
demic words and word families stratified by fre-
quency in the corpus.
• Biber et al.&apos;s (1999) reference corpus for their
lists of academic lexical bundles is a 5.5 million
word corpus of articles and sections from books
(in equal halves) with a few textbooks for lay
readers included. This they further divide into 13
disciplines. Academic is one of four main parti-
tions (which they call &apos;registers&apos;)1
• Davies&apos; Corpus of Contemporary American
English (COCA) (n.d.). which divides contem-
porary English into five meta-types, with Aca-
demic as one of the five (80 million words)2. It

is made up entirely of articles in specialist jour-
nals and in a few high-brow general interest pe-
riodicals (American Scholar, Raritan Review,
Literary Review, Cato Journal). It includes
more disciplines (Religion, Fisheries, Photogra-
phy, Military Science, Agriculture) and is sorted
by Library of Congress top headings (A=Gener-
al Works, B=Philosophy, Psychology, Religion,
etc.) consolidated into eight groupings: Educa-
tion, History, Geog/SocSci, Law/PolSci, Hu-
manities, Phil/Rel, Sci/Tech, Medicine, Misc
(=LC A+Z). These eight parts are searchable, so
that we can determine for any expression not
just whether it is distinctively academic, but
what subtype or types it is distinctive of.
COCA is thus built along principles very similar to
those of AWL and Biber et al.&apos;s reference corpus,
though it is 2 orders of magnitude larger than ei-
ther. We would expect AWL words and Biber et
al.&apos;s distinctively academic lexical bundles also to
be distinctively academic in COCA.

Each of these expressions occurs over four times
more frequently in the COCA Academic register
than any other and twice as frequently there as in
all the others combined. Let that be the working
definition of “distinctive.” So for example, the
presence or absence of occurs 3.72 times per mil-
lion words in the COCA Academic subcorpus,
0.35 times per million in the Magazines, and neg-
ligibly in Spoken, Fiction, and Newspapers. It is
thus 10 times more frequent in the Academic sub-
corpus than in Magazines and passes the 4 times or
more criterion for distinctiveness. In addition,
some frequent AWL words were checked for com-
bining in bigrams, which have the potential of be-
ing even more specific for domain/genre than indi-
vidual words. These indeed prove to be more dis-
tinctive than the individual words (though of
course less frequent). In the first column of Table 2

corpora made with them—the numbers are of
course very high.) These frequencies track those
of the terms in the COCA Academic subcorpus
quite closely, especially the &apos;words&apos; corpus, with
the &apos;bundle&apos; and &apos;bigram&apos; corpora following the
same pattern but at somewhat higher (i.e., &apos;richer&apos;)
levels.
The Wikipedia figures are included for compari-
son. The low frequency of these marker words and
phrases suggests that Wikipedia is not very aca-
demic in its style, which is perhaps not surprising
since Wikipedia authors are not allowed to report
their own research or argue positions.
Most of these putative marker terms are well rep-
resented across the eight academic domains (the
“spread” is good). A word that occurs only in one
domain will appear to be distinctively academic,
but that is a misleading impression. Stent, for ex-
ample, occurs only in the Medical domain in
COCA (along with many other terms: stenosis, mi-
tral—the list is very long). Even when the match
of word and domain is not so clear cut, there are
words and phrases that are found preponderantly in
a discipline or group of disciplines (a “division” in
university parlance) such as the text itself and ear-
ly modern, both Art/Humanities terms, and similar-
ly of the nature of, which scarcely occurs in Sci-
ence or Medicine and only infrequently in Geogra-
phy and Social Science. The next phase of this
project will take up the question of increasing the
resolution down to the level of a subdomain where
a particular set of terms is distinctive.

3 Details of Constructing the Web Corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975324324324">
These three groups of seed terms were used to
make BootCaT tuples (3) and to find URLs of files
which contained all three terms of a tuple (with 20
tuples each) and 40 documents for each tuple. Each
list of URLs was downloaded and cleaned of CSS
style sheets: duplicates and dead-end (e. g., pass-
worded) sites were removed, along with uncon-
verted .pdf files. (Yahoo! rather than Google was
used because Yahoo! filtered out most of the
.pdfs and .doc files. BootCaT was not too suc-
cessful converting .pdf files: a number of them
seemed non-standard or corrupt).
At 3.4 million words, the &apos;single word&apos; corpus was
the largest and had the most pages; the &apos;bundles&apos;
corpus was intermediate in word count but had the
fewest pages. The corpus made with the bigram
seeds was notably shorter (2.2 million words), but
it was very efficient at bringing in occurrences of
seed terms from the other sets. The seed terms
from all sets were used to cross-check (probe) for
occurrence in the other two corpora. These results
are given in Table 2 in the second and third col-
umns. There was no overlap of files (i. e., no files
in common) in the three downloaded Web corpora
and only one overlap between probe term (intrin-
sic) and file seed (intrinsic motivation).
A further set of lexical bundles (not used as seeds)
were run as probes and produced the same pattern
(See Table 3). Most of these are it-impersonal
constructions, and it is not news that academic
writing cultivates the impersonal (though it does
allow a little we plural first person to slip in); in
fact, at this proof-of-concept stage, expected find-
ings are confirmation that the collected corpora
have the properties of academic writing as we
know it across many distinctive lexical bundles,
not just the ones used as seeds.

The domain counts are estimated, since a grep
search over-counts by including URLs referred to
on the page as well as that of the page itself. These
figures are estimated from the URLs in the
“cleaned_urls_list” that is used to download the
pages. Clearly the .edu top-level domain is not
the only or even the most productive source of
pages containing the search key words. If these are
indeed pages of academic writing, then quite a lot
of academic writing on the web would get filtered
out by using an .edu domain filter and a great deal
filtered out using ac.uk.

4.2 Types of sites

<bodyText confidence="0.999988785714286">
The 1656 downloaded pages came from a wide
range of sites. 281 URLs had words such as arti-
cle, journal, paper, research, publication, or other
term that identified the contents as scholarly arti-
cles. On the other hand, there were 26 entries from
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/; 17 pages had the
word blog in their URL and 17 had the word
courses, the latter being teaching sites with hand-
outs. There were nine pages of customer reviews
from www.amazon.com/review and 15 pages
from plato.stanford.edu/entries which
is an encyclopedia of philosophy. All of these sites
might be said to be academic in a looser sense, the
Amazon reviews being the most distant.

5.0 The Next Phase: Increasing Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909024390244">
It is probably only a minority of &apos;academic&apos; terms
that are commonly used across the board in all dis-
ciplines (or groups of disciplines). All disciplines
use have argued, presumably because argument is
at the core of academic endeavor and because the
present perfect is just right for summarizing other
people&apos;s claims and your own. And similarly, all
disciplines have, or agree they should have, a theo-
retical framework. But one does NOT write I ar-
gue in Medicine, or so COCA records, nor has the
word interpretive any use in Medicine, though it is
widely used in all the other disciplines. On the
other hand, Medicine has its own distinctive bun-
dles including it is known that, and it has been
shown/suggested that (Oakey, 2002)4.
It is fairly easy to gather terms that appear to be
distinctive of a certain discipline, or group of disci-
plines, to use them to build web corpora like the
ones illustrated here, and to take frequent terms
from the gathered corpora to do another search
within the discipline/domain, and so to build larger
and more differentiated corpora that match the
COCA/Library of Congress groupings of disci-
plines much as has been reported here for &apos;Aca-
demic&apos; writing as such. &apos;Distinctive&apos; can be less
stringently defined in this application: a term is
distinctive in an academic subdomain when it is
distinctively academic and is at least twice as fre-
quent in the subdomain as in the Academic domain
as a whole. The terms still have a strong selective
effect because when used in triplets, their selective
weights are as it were multiplied.
For example, the left column of Table 5 has a set
of search seed terms distinctive of texts in the
COCA &apos;Phil/Rel&apos; subcorpus (LC: B).5 The right
column gives a set of search seeds selected from
the first 100-300 most frequent words in the corpus
made with the initial set of seeds. (Very frequent
terms were checked as possible bigram members
and the bigram used instead in the actual download
of the second corpus.)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.99244175">
4Oakey&apos;s model study is based on data from the BNC. Some of
his discipline-distinctive patterns scarcely occur in the much
larger COCA (e. g, it is found/concluded that).

The two resulting lists of URLs overlapped only
slightly. By using each corpus as reference for a
keyword search of the other, the terms most dis-
tinctive of each (vis-a-vis the other) were extract-
ed. These terms fall into fairly distinct clusters:
The first corpus leans toward hermeneutics/inter-
pretation and toward marxism (via dialectic and
materialism)—in short, a course in Continental
philosophy (sample key words: historical con-
sciousness, Marx, Gadamer, bourgeois, class
struggle, Scripture, exegesis). The second has
Dennett and falsifiable as keys and leans toward
Anglo-American philosophy of science and of
mind (other key words: qualia, representational
contents, mental states, argument for/against, sen-
sory experience, physicalism). Here we begin to
tap into key terms and themes of various schools of
thought within and overlapping disciplines.
It is possible to determine which of the seed tuplets
brought in the key phrases; i. e., the strength of
particular seeds as attractors of other terms. It can
also be determined when a particular web page is
causing a term to spike, which happens fairly often
in academic writing, since it favors frequent repeti-
tion of the key concepts of the article.
These clusters reflect dependencies (or co-loca-
tions) within texts rather than within local &apos;frames&apos;
of contiguous words—which is to say registers of
the particular disciplines/subdisciplines. Proceed-
ing in this way, specific lists of terms and also
turns of phrase for these disciplines can be extract-
ed. This phase of the project is nearing completion.
The power of BootCaT tuplet search to collect cor-
pora rich in the features of academic registers is re-
markable, and its potential uses are many.

The procedure uses terms distinctive of different registers and disciplines in COCA to locate and gather web pages containing them. 1 Introduction This is a preliminary report of the results of a new procedure for building a webcorpus of academic writing using BootCaT seeded searches (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004). The procedure inverts the usual one of finding text-internal traits that correlate with externally defined corpora and subcorpora (Lee, 2001). Instead, we seek words and lexical bundles so distinctive of a text-type (“register”) that they will induce BootCaT to download texts of that type and no other. In the initial phase, a list of search seed terms is developed to download academic texts; in the second phase, this procedure is refined to increase its resolution, developing search seeds that can bring in texts belonging to sub-types such as Science and Technology, Arts and Humanities, History and Political Science, and so on. One might object that this is a solution to a nonproblem: that all that is necessary is to limit searches</context>
