We demonstrate the use of default de-
fault inheritance hierarchies to represent
the morphology of Yor`ub´a verbs in the
KATR formalism, treating inflectional ex-
ponences as markings associated with the
application of rules by which complex
word forms are deduced from simpler
roots or stems. In particular, we sug-
gest a scheme of slots that together make
up a verb and show how each slot rep-
resents a subset of the morphosyntactic
properties associated with the verb. We
also show how we can account for the
tonal aspects of Yor`ub´a, in particular, the
tone associated with the emphatic end-
ing. Our approach allows linguists to gain
an appreciation for the structure of verbs,
gives teachers a foundation for organizing
lessons in morphology, and provides stu-
dents a technique for generating forms of
any verb.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895654545455">
Recent research into the nature of morphology has
demonstrated the feasibility of several approaches
to the definition of a language’s inflectional sys-
tem. Central to these approaches is the notion of
an inflectional paradigm. In general terms, the
inflectional paradigm of a lexeme L can be re-
garded as a set of cells, where each cell is the pair-
ing of L with a set of morphosyntactic properties,
and each cell has a word form as its realization;
for instance, the paradigm of the lexeme walk in-
cludes cells such as &lt;WALK, {3rd singular present
indicative}&gt; and &lt;WALK, {past}&gt;, whose real-
izations are the word forms walks and walked.
Given this notion, one approach to the definition
of a language’s inflectional system is the realiza-
tional approach (Matthews 1972, Zwicky 1985,
Anderson 1992, Corbett &amp; Fraser 1993, Stump
2001); in this approach, each word form in a lex-
eme’s paradigm is deduced from the lexical and
morphosyntactic properties of the cell that it re-
alizes by means of a system of morphological
rules. For instance, the word form walks is de-
duced from the cell &lt;WALK, {3rd singular present
indicative}&gt; by means of the rule of -s suffixation,
which applies to the root walk of the lexeme WALK
to express the property set {3rd singular present
indicative}.
We apply the realizational approach to the study
of Yor`ub´a verbs. Yor`ub´a, an Edekiri language
of the Niger-Congo family (Gordon 2005), is the
native language of more than 30 million peo-
ple in West Africa. Although it has many di-
alects, all speakers can communicate effectively
using Standard Yor`ub´a (SY), which is used in ed-
ucation, mass media and everyday communica-
tion (Ad´ewo.l´e 1988).
We represent our realizational analysis of SY
in the KATR formalism (Finkel, Shen, Stump &amp;
Thesayi 2002). KATR is based on DATR, a for-
mal language for representing lexical knowledge
designed and implemented by Roger Evans and
Gerald Gazdar (Evans &amp; Gazdar 1989). Our infor-
mation about SY is primarily due to the expertise
of the second author.
This research is part of a larger effort aimed at
elucidating the morphological structure of natural
languages. In particular, we are interested in iden-
tifying the ways in which default-inheritance re-
lations describe a language’s morphology as well
as the theoretical relevance of the traditional no-
tion of principal parts. To this end, we have
applied similar techniques to Hebrew (Finkel &amp;
Stump 2007), Latin (Finkel &amp; Stump to appear,
2009b), and French (Finkel &amp; Stump to appear,
2009a).

As we demonstrate below, the realizational ap-
proach leads to a KATR theory that provides a
clear picture of the morphology of SY verbs. Dif-
ferent audiences might find different aspects of it
attractive.

<listItem confidence="0.998257214285714">
• A linguist can peruse the theory to gain an
appreciation for the structure of SY verbs,
with all exceptional cases clearly marked ei-
ther by morphophonological diacritics or by
rules of sandhi, which are segregated from all
the other rules.
• A teacher of the language can use the the-
ory as a foundation for organizing lessons in
morphology.
• A student of the language can suggest verb
roots and use the theory to generate all the ap-
propriate forms, instead of locating the right
paradigm in a book and substituting conso-
nants.

2 SY phonetics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9866976">
SY has 18 consonants (b, d, f, g, gb, h, j, k, l, m,
n, p, r, s, s., t, w, y), 7 simple vowels (a, e, e., i, o,
o. , u), 5 nasalized vowels (an, en, in, o. n, un), and
2 syllabic nasals (m, n). SY has 3 phonologically
contrastive tones: High, Mid and Low. Phoneti-
cally, there are also two tone variants, rising and
falling (Laniran &amp; Clements 2003). SY orthog-
raphy employs two transcription formats for these
tones. In one format, the two tones are marked
on one vowel. For example, the vowel a with a
low tone followed by a high tone is written as aˇ
and with a high tone followed by a low tone as ˆa.
This paper follows the alternative orthography, in
which each tone is carried by exactly one vowel.
We write aˇ as `a´a and aˆ as ´a`a.

3 A Realizational KATR theory for SY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997466083333333">
The purpose of the KATR theory described here
is to generate verb forms for SY, specifically,
the realizations of all combinations of the mor-
phosyntactic properties of tense (present, continu-
ous, past, future), polarity (positive, negative), per-
son (1, 2 older, 3 older, 2 not older, 3 not older),
number (singular, plural), and strength (normal,
emphatic). The combinations form a total of 160
morphosyntactic property sets (MPSs).
Our analysis posits that SY verbs consist of a se-
quence of morphological formatives, arranged in
six slots:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998652230769231">
• Person, which realizes the person and num-
ber but is also influenced by tense and polar-
ity,
• Negator marker 1, which appears only in the
negative, but is slightly influenced by person
and number,
• Tense, which realizes the tense, influenced by
polarity,
• Negator marker 2, which appears only in the
negative, influenced by tense,
• Stem, which realizes the verb’s lexeme,
• Ending, which appears only for emphatic
verbs.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999464">
Unlike many other languages, SY does not dis-
tinguish conjugations of verbs, making its KATR
theory simpler than ones for languages such as
Latin and Hebrew. However, the tonality of SY
adds a small amount of complexity.
A theory in KATR is a network of nodes. The
network of nodes constituting SY verb morphol-
ogy is very simple: every lexeme is represented
by a node that specifies its stem and then refers to
the node Verb. The node Verb refers to nodes
for each of the slots. We use rules of Sandhi as a
final step before emitting verb forms.
Each of the nodes in a theory houses a set of
rules. We represent the verb m´un ‘take’ by a node:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.978513">
Take:
1 &lt;stem&gt; = m ´un
2 = Verb
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991123571428571">
The node, named Take, has two rules, which
we number for discussion purposes only. KATR
syntax requires that a node be terminated by a sin-
gle period (full stop), which we omit here. Our
convention is to name the node for a lexeme by a
capitalized English word (here Take) represent-
ing its meaning.
Rule 1 says that a query asking for the stem of
this verb should produce a two-atom result con-
taining m and ´un. Rule 2 says that all other queries
are to be referred to the Verb node, which we in-
troduce below.
A query is a list of atoms, such as &lt;stem&gt;
or &lt;normal positive past 3Older
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.973985">
26
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.983476431372549">
sg&gt;, addressed to a node such as Take. In
our theory, the atoms in queries either represent
morphological formatives (such as stem) or
morphosyntactic properties (such as 3Older
and sg).
A query addressed to a given node is matched
against all the rules housed at that node. A rule
matches if all the atoms on its left-hand side
match the atoms in the query. A rule can match
even if its atoms do not exhaust the entire query.
In the case of Take, the query &lt;stem past&gt; is
matched by Rules 1 and 2; the query &lt;positive
past&gt; is only matched by Rule 2.
Left-hand sides expressed with path nota-
tion (&lt;pointed brackets&gt;) only match if
their atoms match an initial substring of the
query. Left-hand sides expressed with set nota-
tion ({braces}) match if their atoms are all ex-
pressed, in whatever position, in the query. We
usually use set notation for queries based on mor-
phological formatives and morphosyntactic prop-
erties, where order is insignificant.
When several rules match, KATR picks the best
match, that is, the one whose left-hand side “uses
up” the most of the query. This choice embodies
P¯an.ini’s principle, which entails that if two rules
are applicable, the more restrictive rule applies, to
the exclusion of the more general rule. We some-
times speak of a rule’s P¯an.ini precedence, which
is the cardinality of its left-hand side. If a node in a
KATR theory houses two applicable rules with the
same P¯an.ini precedence, we consider that theory
malformed.
In our case, Rule 2 of Take only applies when
Rule 1 does not apply, because Rule 1 is always
a better match if it applies at all. Rule 2 is called
a default rule, because it applies by default if no
other rule applies. Default rules define a hierarchi-
cal relation among some of the nodes in a KATR
theory.
KATR generates output based on queries di-
rected to nodes representing individual lexemes.
Since these nodes, such as Take, are not referred
to by other nodes, they are called leaves, as op-
posed to nodes like Verb, which are called inter-
nal nodes. The KATR theory itself indicates the
list of queries to be addressed to all leaves. Here is
the output that KATR generates for several queries
directed to the Take node.

The rule for Take illustrates the strategy we
term provisioning (Finkel &amp; Stump 2007): It pro-
vides information (here, the letters of the verb’s
stem) needed by a more general node (here,
Verb).

3.1 The Verb node

Rule 2 is a default rule that composes the sur-
face form by referring to a node for each slot
except the stem. This rule directs an query that
does not satisfy Rule 1 to each of the nodes men-
tioned. In this way, the theory computes values
for each of the slots that represent the morpholog-
ical formatives. The KATR phrase &amp;quot;&lt;stem&gt;&amp;quot;
directs a new query to the original node (in our
case, Take), which has provisioned information
about the stem (in our case, m ´un). The comma
in the right-hand side of rule 2 is how we repre-
sent a word division; our post-processing removes
ordinary spaces.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998198">
3.2 Auxiliary nodes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797">
The Verb node invokes several auxiliary nodes to
generate the surface forms for each slot.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991199">
Person:
1 {1 sg} = mo
2 {1 sg negative} = mi
3 {1 sg future} = m
4 {1 pl} = a
5 {2Older} = e.
6 {2Older continuous} = `e.
7 {2Older continuous pl} = w ´o.n
8 {3Older positive !future} = w ´o.n
9 {3Older} = w o.n
10 {2NotOlder sg} = o
11 {2NotOlder pl} = e.
12 {2NotOlder continuous sg} = o`
13 {2NotOlder continuous pl} = `e.
14 {3NotOlder} = o´
15 {3NotOlder negative sg} =
16 {3NotOlder future} = y´ı
17 {3NotOlder pl ++} = &lt;3Older&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841133333333">
Generally, the Person slot depends on person
and number, but it depends to a small extent on
polarity and tense. For example, the exponence1
of 1 sg is m, but it takes an additional vowel
in the negative and the non-future positive. On
the other hand, the exponence of 1 pl is always
a. Rule 8 applies to tenses other than future, as
marked by the notation !future; in the future,
the more general Rule 9 applies. Rule 17 reflects
any query involving 3NotOlder pl to the same
node (Person) and 3Older forms, to which it
is identical. The ++ notation increases the P¯an.ini
precedence of this rule so that it applies in pref-
erence to Rules 15 and 16, even if one of them
should apply.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.91372375">
Negator1:
1An exponence is a surface form or part of a surface form,
that is, the way a given lexeme appears when it is attached to

<bodyText confidence="0.99615275">
The first negation slot introduces the exponence
o` for negative forms (Rules 1 and 2) and the null
exponence for positive forms. In most situations,
this vowel starts a new word (represented by the
comma), and careful speech may place an op-
tional k before the vowel (represented by the par-
enthetical k); in 3NotOlder sg, this consonant
is mandatory.

Tense:

6 {future 3NotOlder positive} =
&lt;future 3Older positive&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983885">
The Tense slot is usually empty, as indicated
by Rule 1. However, for both negative and posi-
tive past, the word ti appears here. In the positive
continuous, the following slot (the stem) is pre-
fixed by ´n. We use the hyphen (-) to remove the
following word break by a spelling rule (shown
later). Similarly, future positive forms have a tense
marker, with a special form for 1 sg. As of-
ten happens, the 3NotOlder form reflects to the
3Older form.

Negator2:
1 {future negative} = , n´ı
2 {past negative} = ´ i
3 {} =

<bodyText confidence="0.999916727272727">
The second negator slot adds the word n´ı in the
future (Rule 1). In the past (Rule 2), it changes
the tone of the tense slot from ti to t´ı`ı. In all other
cases, Rule 3 gives a null default. Rule 2 follows
an assumption that tone and vowel can be speci-
fied independently in SY; without this assumption,
this slot would be more cumbersome to specify.
Such floating tones are in keeping with theories of
autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith 1976) and
are seen in other Niger-Congo languages, such as
Bambara (Mountford 1983).

mid tone, in which case the tone becomes low.
(We disagree slightly with Akinlabi and Liber-
man, who suggest that this suffix is in low tone
except after a low tone, in which case it becomes
mid (Akinlabi &amp; Liberman 2000).) For this case,
we introduce a jer2, represented by “I”, for post-
processing in the Sandhi phase, discussed below.
Such forms are important as a way to simplify pre-
sentation, covering many cases in one rule. When
we tried to develop a SY KATR theory without a
jer, we needed to separate the stem of each word
into onset and coda so we could repeat the coda
in emphatic forms, but we had no clear way to in-
dicate the regular change in tone. The jer accom-
plishes both reduplication and tone change with a
single, simple mechanism. It also suggests that the
emphatic ending is really a matter of tone Sandhi,
not a matter of default inheritance.

4 Postprocessing: Sandhi, Spelling and
Alternatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999534571428571">
After the rules produce a surface form, we post-
process that form to account for Sandhi (language-
specific rules dictating sound changes for eu-
phony), spelling conventions, and alternative ex-
ponence. We have only one Sandhi matter to ac-
count for, the jer “I”. We accomplish this postpro-
cessing with these rules:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.940763857142857">
1 #vars $vowel: a e e. i o o. u .
2 #vars $tone: ´ ` .
3 #sandhi $vowel J =&gt; $1 $1 ` .
4 #sandhi $vowel $tone J =&gt; $1 $2 $1 .
5 #sandhi $vowel n J =&gt; $1 n $1 ` n .
6 #sandhi $vowel $tone n J =&gt; $1 $2 n $1
n.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999648076923077">
The first two lines introduce shorthands so
we can match arbitrary vowels and tone marks.
Sandhi rules are applied in order, although in this
case, at most one of them will apply to any surface
form.
Rules 3–6 represent tone Sandhi by showing
how to replace intermediate surface strings with
final surface strings. Each rule has a left-hand side
that is to be replaced by the information on the
right-hand side. Numbers like $1 on the right-
hand side refer to whatever a variable (in this
case, the first variable) on the left-hand side has
matched.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.98869">
2A jer, also called a morphophoneme, is a phonologi-
cal unit whose phonemic expression depends on its context.
It is an intermediate surface form that is to be replaced in a
context-sensitive way during postprocessing.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999405666666667">
Rule 3 indicates that if we see a vowel with-
out a tone mark (indicating mid tone) followed by
the jer, we replace it with the vowel (represented
by $1) repeated with low tone. This specification
follows our assumption that tone and vowel may
be treated independently. Rule 4 indicates that
a vowel followed by a tone mark and the jer is
repeated with mid tone (without a mark). Rules
5 and 6 are similar, but they deal with nasalized
vowels.
There is one spelling rule to remove word
breaks that would otherwise be present. We have
used “-” to indicate that a word break should dis-
appear. We use the following rule to enforce this
strategy:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.883282">
#sandhi - , =&gt; .
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.964679111111111">
That is, a hyphen before a comma removes both.
SY allows the negative future forms (k)`o n(and
k`o n(to be expressed instead as ki´o`o. We provide
rules of alternation for this purpose:
#alternative \(k\)`o , ni=&gt; k`ı´o`o .
#alternative k`o , ni=&gt; k`ı´o`o .
These alternation rules effectively collapse the
three slots, Negator1, Tense, and Negator2 into a
single exponence.

6 Discussion and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994244103448276">
This exercise demonstrates that the realizational
approach to defining language morphology leads
to an effective description of SY verbs. We have
applied language-specific knowledge and insight
to create a default inheritance hierarchy that cap-
tures the morphological structure of the language,
with slots pertaining to different morphosyntactic
properties. In particular, our KATR theory nicely
accounts for the slot structure of SY verbs, even
though most slots are dependent on multiple mor-
phosyntactic properties, and we are easily able to
deal with the tone shifts introduced by the em-
phatic suffix.
This work is not intended to directly address
the problem of parsing, that is, converting surface
forms to pairings of lexemes with morphosyntactic
properties. We believe that our KATR theory for
SY correctly covers all verb forms, but there may
certainly be exceptional cases that do not follow
the structures we have presented. Such cases are
usually easy to account for by introducing infor-
mation in the leaf node of such lexemes. Further,
this work is not in the area of automated learning,
so questions of precision and ability to deal with
unseen data are not directly relevant.
We have constructed the SY theory in KATR
instead of DATR for several reasons.
• We have a very fast KATR implementation,
making for speedy prototyping and iterative
improvement in morphological theories. This
implementation is capable of taking standard
DATR theories as well.
• KATR allows bracket notation ({ and }) on
the left-hand side of rules, which makes it
very easy to specify morphosyntactic proper-
ties for queries in any order and without men-
tioning those properties that are irrelevant to
a given rule. Rules in DATR theories tend to
have much more complicated left-hand sides,
obscuring the morphological rules.
• KATR has a syntax for Sandhi that separates
its computation, which we see as postpro-
cessing of surface forms, from the applica-
tion of morphological rules. It is possible to
write rules for Sandhi in DATR, but the rules
are both unpleasant to write and difficult to
describe.
As we have noted elsewhere (Finkel &amp; Stump
2007), writing KATR specifications requires con-
siderable effort. Early choices color the structure
of the resulting theory, and the author must often
discard attempts and rethink how to represent the
target morphology. The first author, along with
Gregory Stump, has built KATR theories for verbs
in Hebrew, Slovak, Polish, Spanish, Irish, Shughni
(an Iranian language of the Pamir) and Lingala (a
Bantu language of the Congo), as well as for parts
of Hungarian, Sanskrit, and Pali.

<abstract confidence="0.999284363636364">We demonstrate the use of default default inheritance hierarchies to represent the morphology of Yor`ub´a verbs in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponences as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. In particular, we suggest a scheme of slots that together make up a verb and show how each slot represents a subset of the morphosyntactic properties associated with the verb. We also show how we can account for the tonal aspects of Yor`ub´a, in particular, the tone associated with the emphatic ending. Our approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb.</abstract>

Such forms are important as a way to simplify presentation, covering many cases in one rule. When we tried to develop a SY KATR theory without a jer, we needed to separate the stem of each word into onset and coda so we could repeat the coda in emphatic forms, but we had no clear way to indicate the regular change in tone. The jer accomplishes both reduplication and tone change with a single, simple mechanism. It also suggests that the emphatic ending is really a matter of tone S</context>

SY has 3 phonologically contrastive tones: High, Mid and Low. Phonetically, there are also two tone variants, rising and falling (Laniran &amp; Clements 2003). SY orthography employs two transcription formats for these tones. In one format, the two tones are marked on one vowel. For example, the vowel a with a low tone followed by a high tone is written as aˇ and with a high tone followed by a low tone as ˆa. This paper follows the alternative orthography, in which each tone is carried by exactly one vowel.

For instance, the word form walks is deduced from the cell &lt;WALK, {3rd singular present indicative}&gt; by means of the rule of -s suffixation, which applies to the root walk of the lexeme WALK to express the property set {3rd singular present indicative}. We apply the realizational approach to the study of Yor`ub´a verbs. Yor`ub´a, an Edekiri la</context>

Negator2: 1 {future negative} = , n´ı 2 {past negative} = ´ i 3 {} = The second negator slot adds the word n´ı in the future (Rule 1). In the past (Rule 2), it changes the tone of the tense slot from ti to t´ı`ı. In all other cases, Rule 3 gives a null default. Rule 2 follows an assumption that tone and vowel can be specified independently in SY; without this assumption, this slot would be more cumbersome to specify. Such floating tones are in keeping with theories of autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith 1976) and are seen in other Niger-Congo languages, such as Bambara (Mountford 1983). Ending: 1 {} = 2 {emphatic} = ↓ The Ending slot is generally null (Rule 1), but in emphatic forms, it reduplicates the final vowel with a mid tone, unless the vowel already has a 28 mid tone, in which case the tone becomes low. (We disagree slightly with Akinlabi and Liberman, who suggest that this suffix is in low tone except after a low tone, in which case it becomes mid (Akinlabi &amp; Liberman 2000).) For this case, we introduce a jer2, represented by “I”, for postprocessing in the Sandhi phase, discussed below. Such forms are important as a way to simplify presentation, covering many cases </context>
