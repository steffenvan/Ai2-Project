ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988665">
User-adviser dialogues were collected in a typed Wizard-
of-Oz study (man-behind-the-curtain study). Thirty-two
users had to solve simple statistics problems using an un-
familiar statistical package. Users received help on how to
use the statistical package by typing utterances to what they
believed was a computerized adviser. The observed limited
set of users&apos; grammatical and ungrammatical forma
demonstrates the sufficiency of a very restricted grammar of
English for a natural language interface to an advisory sys-
tem. The users&apos; language shares many features of spoken
face-to-face language or of language generated under real-
time production constraints (i.e., very simple forms of
utterances). Yet, users also appeared to believe that the
natural language interface could not handle fragmentary or
informal language and users planned or edited their language
to be more like formal written language (i.e., very infrequent
fragments and phatics). Finally, users also appeared to
believe in poor shared context between users and com-
puterized advisers and referred to objects and events using
complex nominals instead of faster-to-type pronouns.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773083333333">
It has been argued that natural language interfaces with a
very rich functionality are crucial to the effective use of ad-
visory systems and that interfaces using formal languages,
menus, or direct manipulation will not suffice (Finin, Joshi,
and Webber, 1086). Designing, developing, and debugging a
rich natural language interface (its parser, grammar,
recovery strategies from unparsable input, etc.) are time-
consuming and labor-intensive. Nevertheless, natural lan-
guage interfaces can be quite brittle in the face of uncon-
strained input from the user, as can be found in applications
such as user-advising. One step toward a solution to these
problems would be the identification of a subset of gram-
matical and ungrammatical structures that correspond to the
language generated by users in any user-advising situations,
irrespective of the domain. This subset could be used to
design a core grammar, strategies to handle ungrammatical
input, and some parsing heuristics portable to any natural
language interface to advisory systems. This strategy would
increase the habitability of the natural language interface
(Watt, 1068; Trawick, 1083) and reduce its development
cost.
An important feature of this restricted subset is its in-
dependence from a particular domain (e.g., statistics,
medicine), making it, portable. This is in contrast with

another strategy which also capitalizes on restricted subsets
of English, the use of sublanguages. There are naturally oc-
curring subsets of English, usually associated with a par-
ticular domain or trade that have been called sublanguages
(Harris, 1968; Kittredge, 1982). Sublanguages are charac-
terized by distinctive specialized syntactic structures, by the
occurrence of only certain domain-dependent word subclasses
in certain syntactic combinations, and by the inclusion of
specific ungrammatical forms (Sager, 1982). However, the
association of a sublanguage with a particular domain and
the emphasis on syntactic-semantic co-restrictions reduce the
portability of a grammar defined on such a sublanguage.
This paper presents an empirical characterization of
users&apos; language in an user-advising situation for the purpose
of defining a domain-independent restricted subset of gram-
matical and ungrammatical structures to help design more
habitable natural language interfaces to advisory systems.
This paper also presents an interpretation of the factors that
cause users to naturally limit themselves to a very restricted
subset of English in typed communications between users and
computerized advisers. We believe these factors will be
found in any typed communications between users and ad-
visers for the purposes of performing a primary task. Hence,
the restricted subset of English should be general to any such
situations.

A STUDY OF USER-ADVISER DIALOGUES
IN A WIZARD-OF-OZ SETTING
METHOD &amp; PROCEDURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998565">
Thirty-two graduate students with basic statistical
knowledge were asked to solve up to eleven simple statistics
problems. Participants had to use an unfamiliar statistical
package to solve the problems. The upper window of the
participants&apos; screen was used to perform operations with the
statistical package and the lower window was used to type
utterances to the adviser. The participants were instructed
to ask help in English from what they believed was a com-
puterized adviser by typing in the help window. The
participants&apos; and adviser&apos;s utterances were sent to each
other&apos;s monitor and the utterances were recorded and time-
stamped automatically to files.

RESULTS AND COMPARISON TO OTHER
STUDIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998172941176471">
We are reporting only a small subset of our results, those
to be compared to the results of Thompson (1980) and of
Chafe (1982). The comparison is to identify the grammatical
and ungrammatical specializations specific to users&apos; language
with advisory systems and to help determine what features
of user-advising situations might encourage or cause such
specializations of structures. Chafe (1982) investigated Infor-
mal Spoken language (i.e., dinner table conversations) and
formal written language (i.e., academic papers). Thompson
(1980), in her second study, compared three types of
dialogues, Spoken Face-to-Face, Typed Human-Human
(terminal-to-terminal) with both conversants knowing their
counterpart was human, and Human-Computer using the
REL natural language front-end. The task was information
retrieval.
The data table report two sets of data, the percentage of
utterances with a particular form (e.g., one or more frag-
ments, one or more phatics) to compare to Thompson&apos;s
results and the corresponding number of occurrences of this
form per 1000 words to compare to Chafe&apos;s results. When
numbers are omitted from the tables, the corresponding data
were not collected by Thompson or Chafe. Note that the
reported data are only about users&apos; utterances, and not the
adviser&apos;s utterances. We will use typed user-adviser
dialogues and Wizard-of-Oz condition to refer to the data of
our study.
Completeness and Formality of Users&apos;
Utterances
As can be seen in Table 1, for completeness (i.e.,
fragments) and formality (i.e., phatics and and-connectors)
users&apos; utterances with advisory systems are more like
Human-Computer dialogues and Formal Written language
than Spoken Face-to-Face or Typed Human-Human
dialogues.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.943071">
Table 1: Completeness and Formality
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972703703704">
Users avoided casual forms of language since they
produced only 24% of fragmentary utterances, as opposed to
74% in Typed Human-Human dialogues, but similar to 19%
in the Human-Computer condition. Similarly, we found 2%
of utterances with phatics, as opposed to .59% in the Typed
Human-Human dialogues, but similar to 4% in the Human-
Computer dialogues. Likewise, Chafe (1980) found no
phatics in Formal Written discourse, but .,bout 23 per 1000
words in informal speech. There is a similar finding for and-
connectors.
Users in the typed user-adviser dialogues seem to expect
the interface to be unable to handle fragmentary input such
as found in Informal Spoken language and planned or
edited their language to be as complete and formal as
in the Human-Computer dialogues, and more complete and
formal than the language in Typed Human-Human dialogues.
This is the case even though the %Vizard in our study hardly
ever rejected or misunderstood any users&apos; utterance, no mat-
ter how fragmentary or ungrammatical it was. However,
when conversants know that their counterpart is another
human, their language contains a large percentage of frag-
ments and phatics, even when typed. So it appears that a
priori beliefs about the nature and abilities of the adviser
(i.e., this is not a human) can determine the characteristics of
the language produced by the user, even when task and lin-
guistic performances by the adviser were not negatively af-
fected by fragmentary language from the user.

<bodyText confidence="0.999973896551724">
Even though users seemed to attempt to edit or plan
their utterances to be more complete and formal, 31% of the
utterances contained one or more ungrammaticalities
(excluding spelling and punctuation mistakes, if included
about 50% of utterances were ungrammatical). The most
frequent ungrammaticalities were fragments (13% of ut-
terances with part(s) of the utterance being one or more
fragments), missing constituents (14% of utterances with one
or more determiners missing), and lack of agreement between
constituents (5% of utterances). While users seemed to plan
or to edit their language to be as complete and formal as in
the Human-Computer dialogues, certain types of ungram-
maticalities were produced. Two possible interpretations of
this finding are: 1) Certain types of ungrammaticalities do
not seem to be easily under the conversant&apos;s control and
edited or planned to be avoided during the dialogue; 2) They
correspond to a telegraphic language assumed to be under-
stood by the interface.
It would be interesting to find whether really two types of
ungrammaticalities exist, some that can be avoided under
some planning and others that cannot be so easily avoided.
However, it is unclear whether the purposeful avoidance of
some ungrammaticalities by users can be capitalized upon to
reduce the need for sophisticated robust parsing as we do not
know the cost from the users of avoiding certain types of un-
grammaticalities. On the other hand, knowing the nature
and frequency of the actual ungrammaticalities produced by
users, as they are provided by this study, facilitates realizing
robust parsing.

Short, simple (95% of our utterances were simple), active

miners and unmarked agreements, see the section on
Ungrammaticalities) characterize the language in typed user-
adviser dialogues observed in our study. These same features
are features of unplanned language, which are also features
of child language, which are also features of language
produced under real-time production constraints (Ochs, 1979;
Givon, 1979).

While formality and completeness of typed user-adviser
dialogues resemble more Formal Written language, the
general syntactic features of typed user-adviser dialogues
resemble more Informal Spoken language. Formality and
completeness appear to be independent properties of users&apos;
language from the general syntactic features, possibly
planned independently.
More important for the design of natural language inter-
faces, the observation that typed user-adviser dialogues
resemble language produced under real-time production con-
straints indicates that users are strained by typing utterances
to request help to perform a primary task. This constrains
the usability of natural language interfaces as interfaces to
advisory systems. One needs to identify the conditions under
which the benefits of obtaining help outweight the costs of
typing in utterances to determine when natural language in-
terfaces are effective interfaces to advisory systems. On the
other hand, the natural restrictions on the language produced
by the users appear generalizable to any situation where real-
time production constraints exist, of which, we believe, any
typed interaction to an advisory system for the purpose of
performing a primary task is an instance.

Features Due Specifically to the User-Advising
Application
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.891025875">
As can be seen in Table 3, there are less imperatives in
user-advising dialogues because the user cannot request the
adviser to perform a statistical operation. Moreover, we also
observe a goal-directed language with frequent to infinitives
(I want/need to ...) r.nd to purpose clauses (What is the
command to compute ...), much more frequent than in Infor-
mal Spoken or Formal Written languages. We believe this is
the only feature that appears to be specific to the advisory
application, as opposed to be specific to communications un-
der real-time constraints. However, the goal-directedness of
the language may be specific to advisory systems for
procedural tasks as opposed to more generaln information
retrieval tasks. Of course, we are here excluding lexical
restrictions because they are expected and uninteresting and
syntactic-semantic co-restrictions because of the desire for
easy portability.

Complexity of Referring Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994743390243903">
In our study, users produced mostly very simple sentence
constructions, as if under real-time production constraints
(e.g., users&apos; utterances were short and 95% of them were
simple (see the section on General Syntactic Features)).
Nevertheless, very few pronouns occurred, 3% of utterances
contained pronouns, similar to what was found in Formal
Written Language, Human-Computer dialogues, and in
Cohen, Pertig, &amp; Starr (1982) in their typed terminal-to-
terminal condition. This is surprising because pronouns are
very short to type. However, there were very frequent com-
plex nominals with prepositional phrases (e.g., a record of the
listing of the names of the features). At least 50% of the
user-adviser utterances had one or more prepositional
phrases. As can be seen in Table 4, most of the structurally
ambiguous prepositional attachments are to NPs, in fact,
mostly to the most contiguous/nearest NP. So, users prefer
longer to type complex nominals with explicit relations be-
tween contiguous NPs over faster to type pronouns, even
though there is evidence that they are operating under real-
time production constraints. Because pronominal noun
phrases (and also deictic expressions) are so rare, it appears
that users rely little on spatial context (i.e., the screen), lin-
guistic context (i.e., the utterances produced so far), and task
context (i.e., statistical commands typed so far) in producing
referring expressions. One interpretation of this finding is
that users believe that there is poor shared context between
user and adviser when they do not share physical context (as
in Formal Written language) or do not know the linguistic
capabilities of the conversant (as in Human-Computer
dialogues). So, while in unplanned discourse speakers rely
more on the context to express propositions and use more
pronouns than in planned discourse (Ochs, 1979) and while
user-adviser dialogues exhibit many features of unplanned
discourse, users did not capitalize on context in producing
referring expressions. It appears that the referential func-
tions in language can be planned independently or and are
not necessarily subject to the same real-time production con-
straints than the predicative and other functions of language.
Again we are finding that typed user-adviser dialogues have
some features of planned, Formal Written language but also
have features of unplanned, Informal Spoken language.

Attachments
Nevertheless, not only are most prepositional attach-
ments to NPs to create precise description of objects, they
are mostly to the most contiguous NP. This observation
suggests that real-time production constraints nevertheless
play some role in the production of referential expressions.
Users appear to minimize resources allocated to the produc-
tion of referential expressions by reducing short-term
memory load by attachments to the lowest, most recent NP.
This interpretation is supported by studies that show that it
is easier to process right-branching structures than left-
branching ones (Yngve, 1960).
The finding that most prepositional phrases attach to
NPs rather than VPs and moreover attach most often to the
lowest, nearest NP is important for the semantic interpreta-
tion of sentences because of the combinatorial explosion of
possible attachments of prepositional phrases.

DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98858925">
Users&apos; utterances in typed user-adviser dialogues, when
the users believe that the adviser is computerized, resemble
Informal Spoken speech, except for referring expressions (i.e.,
frequent complex nominals) and for completeness and for-
mality (i.e., few phatics and and-connectors, and relatively
few fragments), in which case they resemble more Formal
Written language. We would like to hypothesize that the
grammatical and ungrammatical forms observed occur be-
cause the communicative context and the application induce
certain user&apos;s beliefs and goals and induce certain processing
constraints which determine the most effective syntactic
forms to communicate verbally. The communicative context
describes dimensions of the situation in which the discourse is
generated that are believed to affect the form of the dis-
course. Examples of dimensions are: interaction, the extent
to which user and adviser can quickly interact, respond to
each other; involvement, the extent to which the communica-
tion is directed specifically to one person as opposed to an
anonymous class of persons; spatial commonality, the degree
to which the conversants see each other, see the same physi-
cal environment, and know that they share this environment,
perceptually. As can be seen in Table 5, typed user-adviser
dialogues in a Wizard-of-Oz setting are more similar to Infor-
mal Spoken language on dimensions of interaction and in-

volvement, but more similar to Formal Written language on
the dimension of spatial commonality. We would like to
hypothesize that different values on these dimensions are as-
sociated with different restricted languages produced by the
users. Findings from Biber (1986) help support this
hypothesis. He performed a factor analysis on 545 text
samples. He uncovered the following three dimensions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988185">
• INTERACTIVE vs. Edited: High personal in-
volvement and real-time constraints.
• SITUATED vs. Abstract contexts: Reliance on
external situation, concrete vs. detached and
deliberate.
• IMMEDIATE vs. Reported: Reference to a cur-
rent situation Vs. removed or past situation.
</listItem>
<tableCaption confidence="0.990405">
Table 5: Communicative Context Parameters
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982275">
From the set of features reported by Biber that loaded
highly on the three dimensions, user-adviser dialogues had
features of both interactive texts (e.g., many Wh-questions,
many first person references, final prepositions) and edited
texts (e.g., few phatics). This is because user-adviser
dialogues, while written by users uncertain about the
interface&apos;s ability to handle fragmentary and informal input,
have a high degree of interaction and involvement of the
conversants. The syntactic features observed in user-adviser
dialogues overlapped greatly with the features of situated
texts (e.g., few passives and nominalizations), except for the
frequent use of complex nominals and unfrequent use of
pronouns an deictic expressions, and of Immediate texts
(e.g., use of present tense, few third person pronouns). The
complexity of referring expressions uncovers a dimension not
revealed in Biber&apos;s work: the degree of believed shared
knowledge by the conversants. Our users seemed to assume
poor shared knowledge and relied on complex referring ex-
pressions to insure successful communication. Another
dimension is the conversants&apos; belief in the ability of their
counterpart to handle fragmentary or informal language.
Informal Spoken face-to-face language is often unplanned,
interactive, situated, immediate, and subject to real-time
production constraints. So are users&apos; typed utterances to ad-
visory systems. However, unlike Informal Spoken face-to-
face language, users believe that there is poor shared context
between conversants and rely little on context in producing
referring expressions and users do not assume that the inter-
face can handle fragmentary or informal language.
We would like to conclude by making the hypothesis that
any typed terminal-to-terminal user-adviser dialogues will be
similar to Informal Spoken language, as was observed in our
study, because they are under the same communicative con-
text and application. This provides a subset of grammatical
and ungrammatical forms that can be used to define a core
grammar portable to most user-advising situations, irrespec-
tive of the domain. On the other hand, the complexity of
referring expressions and the degree of completeness and for-
mality of language may differ according to the users&apos; beliefs
about the linguistic capabilities of the interface. ,

The users&apos; language shares many features of spoken face-to-face language or of language generated under realtime production constraints (i.e., very simple forms of utterances). Yet, users also appeared to believe that the natural language interface could not handle fragmentary or informal language and users planned or edited their language to be more like formal written language (i.e., very infrequent fragments and phatics). Finally, users also appeared to believe in poor shared context between users and computerized advisers and referred to objects and events using complex nominals instead of faster-to-type pronouns.</abstract>

We would like to hypothesize that different values on these dimensions are associated with different restricted languages produced by the users. Findings from Biber (1986) help support this hypothesis. He performed a factor analysis on 545 text samples. He uncovered the following three dimensions: • INTERACTIVE vs. Edited: High personal involvement and real-time constraints. • SITUATED vs. Abstract contexts: Reliance on external situation, concrete vs. detached and deliberate. • IMMEDIATE vs. Reported: Reference to a current situation Vs. removed or past situation.

One interpretation of this finding is that users believe that there is poor shared context between user and adviser when they do not share physical context (as in Formal Written language) or do not know the linguistic capabilities of the conversant (as in Human-Computer dialogues). So, while in unplanned discourse speakers rely more on the context to express propositions and use more pronouns than in planned discourse (Ochs, 1979) and while user-adviser dialogues exhibit many features of unplanned discourse, users did not capitalize on context in producing referring expressions. It appears that the referential functions in language can be planned independently or and are not necessarily subject to the same real-time production constraints than the predicative and other functions of language. Again we are finding that typed user-adviser dialogues have some features of planned, Formal Written language but also have features of unplanned, Informal Spoken language.
