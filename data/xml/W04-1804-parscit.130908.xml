Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946266666667">
The Gene Ontology is an important tool for the
representation and processing of information
about gene products and functions. It provides
controlled vocabularies for the designations of
cellular components, molecular functions, and
biological processes used in the annotation of
genes and gene products. These constitute
three separate ontologies, of cellular com-
ponents), molecular functions and biological
processes, respectively. The question we
address here is: how are the terms in these
three separate ontologies related to each other?
We use statistical methods and formal
ontological principles as a first step towards
finding answers to this question.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999014081632653">
(Zhu et al 2004) noted that creating a model of
the dynamics of molecular interaction networks
offers enormous potential for understanding
systems biology. Existing work has led to the
development of databases and ontologies which
provide classifications and annotations based on a
gene product’s function, location, structure and so
on, as for example in PANTHER (Thomas PD et al
2003), a library of protein families and subfamilies
indexed by function, and the Gene Ontology
Annotation1 (GOA) (Camon et al 2003).
Further progress requires a robust formal
ontology of structures, locations, functions and
processes, linked together via relations such as
is_part_of, is_located_at, is_realized_by, and so
forth. As a step along this road, we provide a
methodology for deriving and representing
association rules between the entities present
within the separate ontologies of the Gene
Ontology.2 (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2001).
Such rules will be able to situate a biological
process in relation to a cellular location to an
agent. They will be able to relate lower-granularity
molecular functions in relation to higher-
granularity biological processes, and establish
other sorts of relations between entities in different
parts of GO.
A preliminary study in this area (Burgun et al
2004) combines ontological, lexical and statistical
principles. Their study provides association rules
on a selected set of 23 gene products that were
potentially involved in enterocyte differentiation
and that showed similar levels of expression.
(Clelland and Oinn) provide commonly annotated
terms based on the CluSTr database (Kriventseva
et al 2001), which has recently been incorporated
into the QuickGO browser.3 Association rules have
been used for mining gene expression data by
(Creighton and Hanash 2003). (Ogren et al 2004)
studied the compositional nature of the GO terms
and described the dependencies among them.
Our investigation draws on the fact that terms
from GO’s separate ontologies are often used to
annotation the same gene or gene product. We
draw on the TIGR database to establish the
corresponding patterns of association between
terms in GO when taken in its entirety.
In what follows we describe the results of this
work We analysed all of TIGR’s 84,833

products present within GOA and focusing on the
TIGR database within the February 2004 edition of
GO. These associations were mined to establish
association links between GO terms using standard
statistical database techniques based on the so-
called apriori algorithm and using a part of speech
tagger. The discovered links were then analysed
on the basis of methods drawn from foundational
ontology.

2.1 The Cellular Component Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99488425">
GO’s cellular component (cc) vocabulary consists
of terms such as flagellum, chromosome, ferritin,
extracellular matrix and virion. This ontology is
the GO counterpart of anatomy within the medical
framework. GO includes in this vocabulary both
the extracellular environment of cells and the cells
themselves (that is, cell is subsumed in GO by
cellular component).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999243">
2.2 The Molecular Function Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986908">
GO’s definition of molecular function (mf) is: “the
action characteristic of a gene product.” The mf
vocabulary accordingly subsumes terms describing
actions, for example: ice nucleation, binding, or
protein stabilization.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999602">
2.3 The Biological Process Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999499894736842">
A biological process (bp) is defined in GO as: “A
phenomenon marked by changes that lead to a
particular result, mediated by one or more gene
products”. Terms in bp can be quite specific
(glycolysis) or very general (death). GO’s mf and
bp terms are clearly closely interrelated. The
biological process of anti-apoptosis, for example,
certainly involves the molecular function now
labelled apoptosis inhibitor activity. Such
molecular functions should stand to biological
processes in a part-of relation. At the same time,
however, GO’s authors insist that part-of holds
only between entities within a single vocabulary,
and they thus provide no guidance as to the cross-
vocabulary relations between the terms. We
published a series of papers pointing out these and
similar problems in GO as currently constituted
(Smith et al 2004; Smith et al 2003; Kumar and
Smith 2004; Kumar and Smith 2003).

3 TIGR database annotations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855730769231">
The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR)&apos;s
Genome Projects are a collection of curated
databases containing DNA and protein sequence,
gene expression, cellular role, protein family, and
taxonomic data for microbes, plants and humans.
(http://www.tigr.org/) TIGR has manually curated
GO annotation for 6 bacterial genomes (V.
cholerae, S. oneidensis, B. anthracis, G.
sulfurreducens, P. syringae, and C. burnetii) and
two eukaryotes (Arabidopsis thaliana, and
Trypanosoma brucei). In addition, automated
annotation has effected for Expressed Sequence
Tags from several species.
The TIGR database is a rich source of
information about gene indices based on genetic
sequence. TGICL is a pipeline for the analysis of
large Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) and mRNA
databases in which the sequences are first clustered
on the basis of pairwise sequence similarity and
then assembled by individual clusters (Pertia et al
2003). Association rules between GO terms will
enable us to determine the clusters of gene
expression functions and locations in a way that
will add to the knowledge that is contained within
representations of such clusters on the basis of the
gene indices only.

All the annotations from the TIGR database
present within GO’s association table were
selected and placed into a separate table GO terms
were then separated into three separate tables,
depending on which of the three GO vocabularies
they belong to.
Those GO terms which belong to two different
ontologies within GO but are annotated to the same
gene products were then separated out for analysis.
Three new tables were then created containing
those annotations where cc and mf terms, mf and
bp terms, and cc and bp terms are annotated
together.
The distinct term tuples present were grouped
together and their count was used to provide a
measure for weighting an association – which is to
say how many times two GO terms from two
distinct axes are annotated together (Table 1). The
co-occurrence of terms within the annotations were
then combined together (Table 2).

GO’s hierarchy has thus far not been considered.
Rather we have focused only on the terms
themselves to which the annotations are made. For
each GO term used for annotation and for each
subsuming term in GO’s is_a hierarchy, we can
establish the distance of the former from the latter.
(Resnik 1995) has pointed out that the semantic
similarity of terms as one traverses the hierarchical
tree reduces by a factor of log(p(c)) where p(c) is
the probability of finding a child for the term when
seeking information. Table 3 thus represents a
quantification of this semantic similarity, which
can be used to extend the results presented here by
using an approach similar to that advanced in
(Azuahe and Bodenreider, 2004).

4.2 Association rule induction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990248275862">
Association rule induction was originally
developed for so-called market basket analysis,
which aims at finding regularities in the shopping
behaviour of customers of supermarkets, mail-
order companies, online stores etc. (Borgelt and
Kruse, 2002) Association rules are designed to
help in isolating those sets of products that are
frequently bought together. This information is
expressed in the form of rules like &amp;quot;A customer
who buys bread and wine is likely to buy cheese
also.&amp;quot;
Algorithms for inducing association rules from a
set of transactions (the market baskets or shopping
carts bought by customers) usually work in two
steps: First, the so-called frequent item sets are
determined by searching the subset lattice of all
items. For this search there are, in principle, two
approaches: the breadth first search, as employed
by the apriori algorithm (Agrawal et al. 1994), and
the depth first search, on which the eclat algorithm
(Zaki et al. 1997) is based. Second, rules are
constructed from the frequent item sets and filtered
with respect to some quality criterion.
In the GO context, we use association rule
induction to discover links between the ontologies
in which a gene product is described. That is, we
are interested in rules that predict cc from mf or
bp, or rules that describe which mfs in which ccs
constitute a bp, and so forth.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.947586">
4.2.1 Assessment of association rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950575757576">
The number of combinatorially possible rules
here is very high. Consequently we need criteria to
assess and thus to filter out those association rules
which are of serious importance. The standard
measures for this purpose are the support and the
confidence of a rule.
The support of an association rule can be defined
in two different ways: as the fraction of all
transactions to which the rule is applicable (that is,
which contain all items in the antecedent of the
rule) or the fraction of all transactions for which
the rule is correct (that is, which contain all items
appearing in the rule, regardless of whether in
antecedent or consequent). We take the second
approach.
The confidence of an association rule is the
fraction of cases in which it is correct relative to
those in which it is applicable, that is, the ratio of
the number of transactions that contain all items in
the rule to the number of transactions that contain
all items in the antecendent.
A user controls the search for association rules
by providing minimum values for support and
confidence of the rules to be found. From these
values there can be derived a pruning criterion for
the search for frequent item sets in the subset
lattice as well as filtering criteria for the rules
themselves. Only rules that meet both criteria are
reported. More intuitively: we are looking for
association rules that can be applied often (are
above some minimum level of support) and that
make reliable predictions (are above some
minimum level of confidence).

4.2.2 Application to Gene Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923666666667">
In our application of association rule induction
to the analysis of GO we viewed each gene product
annotated to a GO term as a transaction. We thus
have as many transactions as there are gene
products in the data set. We then looked for
frequent co-occurrences of terms within such

transactions and reported them in the form of
association rules. For the search itself we used a
well-known implementation of the apriori
algorithm by (Borgelt and Kruse 2002).
In addition to filtering based on minimum
support and minimum confidence, we also
introduced one further selection criterion by
requiring that the consequent of a rule must come
from a different GO ontology than the terms in the
antecedent of the rule, since rules containing only
terms from one ontology are likely to recover only
the term hierarchy of that ontology, which is not
what is needed here. Such filtering can be achieved
with the apriori implementation we used via the
specification of which part of an association rule
an item may appear in.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994677">
4.3 Experimental results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.848033933333333">
We ran the apriori program three times, each time
restricting the consequent of the rules to a different
ontology. This was required as GO has three
orthogonal ontologies and one needed to treat each
of them as an antecedent and a consequent with
one another. Examples of rules we found are:
membrane [cc]
F oligopeptide transport [bp];
transporter activity [mf]
(0.106%/44, 100.0%)
binding [mf]
F mitochondrial transport [bp];
mitochondrial inner membrane [cc]
(0.106%/44, 100.0%)
protein biosynthesis [bp]
F ribosome [cc];
structural constituent of ribosome [mf]
(0.504%/209, 90.4%)
The two letters in brackets after each term denote
the axis the term comes from. The numbers in
parentheses at the end of each rule describe the
quality of the rule as (S%/A, C%), where S is the
support of the rule as a percentage of gene
products to which the rule is applicable, A is the
absolute number of gene products to which it is
applicable (which is designed to complement the
information regarding support), and C is the
confidence of the rule.
In the GO context S is the percentage of gene
product IDs to which the relevant rule is applicable
(i.e., the percentage of gene product IDs which are
annotated with all the terms in the antecedent in
the rule), A is the absolute number of gene product
IDs to which the rule is applicable, and C is the
percentage of gene product IDs for which the rule
makes the correct prediction relative to those to
which the rule is applicable. Thus for example:
ribosome [cc]
F ribosome biogenesis [bp];
protein biosynthesis [mf]
(0.212%/88, 93.2%)
tells us that 88 gene product IDs (~0.2%) are
annotated with the terms ribosome biogenesis and
protein biosynthesis, of which 93.2% (i.e. 82) are
also annotated with the term ribosome.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.712031">
4.4 Dependencies based on Part-of-speech
Tagging:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999769">
The terms within GO were tagged with a part-of-
speech tagger Qtag4 (Mason, 2004) in order to
understand the linguistic dependencies between the
terms (for example, between adjective and noun or
between adverb and verb).
We tagged all the GO terms and also their
definitions. The definition tags supplement the GO
term tags since definitions are more elaborate and
the specificity of the tagger also increases when it
deals with complete sentences rather than with the
collections of words by which GO terms are
constituted.
Among the terms, we find 1813 adjectives, 29
adverbs, 2808 nouns, 11 prepositions and 57 verbs.
Among the term definitions, we found 3460
adjectives, 252 adverbs, 4837 nouns, 21
prepositions and 595 verbs. The lowest specificity
is found for chemical names.
Unfortunately very few of the interesting part-of-
speech generated dependencies can be captured on
the basis of an analysis of GO terms alone. This is
because there are very few cases of such
dependencies where both terms involved are
present within GO. Examples are: heme transport
and heme transporter activity or growth and
invasive growth. In many other cases, however, we
have complex GO terms whose constituents are not
themselves present in GO. Thus photoreactive
repair is present, but not repair or photoreaction.
Hypersensitive response is present but not
response and hypersensitivity. Terms like during,
within and without play an important role in GO’s
compositional structure, but they are not
themselves present within GO. (For more
examples see (Smith et al. 2004).) To rectify this
defect and to make the corresponding information
accessible to software applications ways must be
found to link GO to third-party ontologies in which
the corresponding constituent terms are themselves
subjected to formal treatment.

Our statistical approach, apriori-generated
association rules and lexical tagging yielded a
range of different sorts of associations, for example
between a location and a process, a process and a
function, a function and another function, a process
and another process, an agent and a function and so
on. One needs a formal ontology, too, in order to
express those relations within a single framework
and thus to create a robust representation scheme
that can serve as the basis for automated reasoning.

5 Basic Formal Ontology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996525">
To do full justice to the information content of
GO and to the rules we isolated requires a formal
ontological scheme which encompasses both
continuants and endurants, and both processes and
functions, and which further has the facility to deal
with entities found on different levels of
granularity (here on the molecular, cellular, and
whole-organism levels). Basic Foundational
Ontology (BFO) is a framework of this type, the
essentials of which can be summarized as follows.
BFO consists of two complementary ontologies,
called SNAP (a snapshot ontology of continuant
entities existing at a time) and SPAN (a four-
dimensional ontology of processes unfolding
themselves through time. (Smith and Grenon,
forthcoming)
The entities recognized by SNAP ontologies
have continuous existence in time, preserve their
identity through change and exist in toto at every
moment at which they exist at all. They include:
independent SNAP entities (substances and their
aggregates, parts, and boundaries), and dependent
SNAP entities such as qualities, roles, conditions,
functions, dispositions, powers, etc.
SPAN entities, in contrast, have temporal parts
which means that they unfold themselves in
successive phases and can be segmented via
segmentation of the temporal intervals which they
occupy. SPAN entities include processes in the
narrow sense, as well as the instantaneous temporal
boundaries of processes, the temporal extents of
processes, and so on.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.902606">
5.1 Formal-Ontological Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999588153846154">
Formal relations are those types of relations
which can traverse the SNAP-SPAN divide; thus
they are relations which glue SNAP and SPAN
entities together.
A number of parameters can then be used in the
construction of sub-ontologies within the wider
BFO framework:
– the ontologies from which the relata derive,
expressed as an ordered list, called the signature of
the relation
– the directionality of the relation
The principal signatures in the binary case are as
follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.4149995">
– &lt;SNAP, SNAP&gt;
– &lt;SPAN, SPAN&gt;
– &lt;SNAP, SPAN&gt;
– &lt;SPAN, SNAP&gt;
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984425">
The first two signatures comprehend relations
between ontologies with different domains or
granularities. The latter comprehend the relations
of realization and participation for example
between a function and the process which is its
functioning, or between an activity and its agent.
Below, we present various relations which can
exist between entities in GO and which were found
on the basis of our analysis of the TIGR database.
Some of the relations require extending the
association rules to include those entities which are
absent within GO but included within its
compositional structure along the lines described
above.

5.1.1 Relations with Signature &lt;SNAP, SNAP&gt;
and &lt;SPAN, SPAN&gt;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957978058823529">
Transgranular Part-Whole Relations: The
relations crossing ontologies of different levels of
granularity are pre-eminently relations of part and
whole. The &lt;SNAP, SNAP&gt; relations between
independent SNAP entities are already present
within GO. Example: nuclear inclusion body part-
of nucleus.
Our association rules uncovered transgranular
part-whole relations between dependent SNAP
entities. For example: transposase activity F DNA
transposition (1.2%/505, 91.5%). Unlike BFO
however GO does not clearly distinguish between
functions and processes; hence the above example
should be interpreted as involving both a
transgranular relation between SNAP dependent
entities:
transposase function

<figureCaption confidence="0.999952">
Figure 1. Modes of Participation
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.918344919354839">
Perpetration: A substance perpetrates an action
(direct and agentive participation in a process).
Initiation: A substance initiates a process.
Example:.
electron transport F electron transporter
activity (0.3%/137, 96.4%)
needs to be extended (by drawing on those terms
which form part of GO’s compositional structure
but are not themselves included in GO ) by:
electron transport F electron transporter
Perpetuation: A substance sustains a process.
Perpetuation normally presupposes that at some
earlier time an entity entered into the relation of
initiation with the process in question. However,
perpetuators are of course not by necessity
themselves initiators. Example,
proteolysis and peptidolysis F subtilase activity
(0.2%/63, 96.8%),
which again needs to be extended by:
proteolysis and peptidolysis F subtilase
Termination: A substance terminates a process
(for example an operator terminates the projection
of a film). Termination normally presupposes that
there has obtained in the immediately prior interval
of time a relation of perpetuation. Processes cannot
pass from initiation to termination instantaneously.
Example:
mitochondrial electron carbon- 13
membrane transport monoxide
oxygenase
activity
In the above example, the association between
carbon-monoxide oxygenase and electron transport
are that of termination. There is an additional
association to the location of this process in the
mitochondrial membranes.
Facilitation: A substance plays a secondary role in
a process. Example:
protein biosynthesis F large ribosomal subunit
(0.1%/56, 98.2%)
Hindrance, prevention: A substance has a
negative effect on the unfolding of a process.
Example:
DNA transposition F transposase activity
(1.2%/505, 91.5%).
While transposase initiates DNA transposition, it
also causes an auto-inhibition later.
Mediation: A substance plays an indirect role in
the unfolding of a process relating other
participants. Example:
formate electron carbon- 18
dehydrogenase transport monoxide
complex oxygenase
activity
In this relationship, formate dehydrogenase plays
the role of a mediator of electron transport.
Patiency: A substance is being acted on by a
process. Example:
provirus provirus prophage integrase 11
integration activity
In this relationship, provirus is being integrated by
the process of provirus integration.

The association rules yielded by our
methodology are only the beginning of a process of
deciphering the ontological relations across various
granularities within the extended GO framework.
We need to formally analyse all the rules in order
to understand how best they fit within formal
ontology and how they can be put together to
create larger ontologies within systems biology.
In validating these associations one method is to
consider those associations which have been
detected on the basis of the annotations present
within GO coming from other source databases.
Clearly if a rule obtains across a plurality of
databases then the corresponding association will
be stronger. One disadvantage of this method,
however, is that annotations of gene products from
different databases to GO are not uniform and so
the results cannot be relied upon beyond a certain
limit of accuracy. Various other aspects of
annotations, for instance, the species under
investigation or the pertinent strength of evidence
will need to be considered.
A further extension of the work will be to predict
“unknown” entities. A large number of annotations
is made to the three GO terms cellular component
unknown, molecular function unknown and
biological process unknown. In those caseswhere
there we have association rules without such
unknown terms but otherwise relating to the same
entities, it could be that the relevant unknown
entity will be able to be predicted. This can be
done with annotations from a single database
source or by putting together annotations from
multiple sources. We need to do further work in
this area. For example, in the following example,
we can establish that in the case where mf is GTP
binding and cc is membrane, the known bf is either
pathogenesis or sporulation (sensu Bacteria) or
protein secretion of metabolism. Thus it is
probable that the unknown process here
corresponds to one or other of these alternatives.

<abstract confidence="0.999109375">The Gene Ontology is an important tool for the representation and processing of information about gene products and functions. It provides controlled vocabularies for the designations of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes used in the annotation of genes and gene products. These constitute three separate ontologies, of cellular components), molecular functions and biological processes, respectively. The question we address here is: how are the terms in these three separate ontologies related to each other? We use statistical methods and formal ontological principles as a first step towards finding answers to this question.</abstract>

Associations between GO terms belonging to cc and mf taking hierarchy into consideration 4.2 Association rule induction Association rule induction was originally developed for so-called market basket analysis, which aims at finding regularities in the shopping behaviour of customers of supermarkets, mailorder companies, online stores etc. (Borgelt and Kruse, 2002) Association rules are designed to help in isolating those sets of products that are frequently bought together. This information is expressed in the form of rules like &amp;quot;A customer who buys bread and wine is likely to buy cheese also.&amp;quot; Algorithms for inducing association rules from a set of transactions (the market baskets or shopping carts bought by customers) usually work in two steps: First, the so-called frequent item sets are determined by searching the subset lattice of all items. For this search there are, in principle, two approaches: the breadth first search, as employed by the aprior</context>

We thus have as many transactions as there are gene products in the data set. We then looked for frequent co-occurrences of terms within such 34 CompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology transactions and reported them in the form of association rules. For the search itself we used a well-known implementation of the apriori algorithm by (Borgelt and Kruse 2002). In addition to filtering based on minimum support and minimum confidence, we also introduced one further selection criterion by requiring that the consequent of a rule must come from a different GO ontology than the terms in the antecedent of the rule, since rules containing only terms from one ontology are likely to recover only the term hierarchy of that ontology, which is not what is needed here. Such filtering can be achieved with the apriori implementation we used via the specification of which part of an association rule an item may appear in. 4.3 Experimental results We ran the aprior</context>

Thus for example: ribosome [cc] F ribosome biogenesis [bp]; protein biosynthesis [mf] (0.212%/88, 93.2%) tells us that 88 gene product IDs (~0.2%) are annotated with the terms ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis, of which 93.2% (i.e. 82) are also annotated with the term ribosome. 4.4 Dependencies based on Part-of-speech Tagging: The terms within GO were tagged with a part-ofspeech tagger Qtag4 (Mason, 2004) in order to understand the linguistic dependencies between the terms (for example, between adjective and noun or between adverb and verb). We tagged all the GO terms and also their definitions. The definition tags supplement the GO term tags since definitions are more elaborate and the specificity of the tagger also increases when it deals with complete sentences rather than with the collections of words by which GO terms are constituted. Among the terms, we find 1813 adjectives, 29 adverbs, 2808 nouns, 11 prepositions and 57 verbs. Among the term definitions, we found 3460 adjectives, 252 ad</context>

Associations between terms belonging all three of GO’s ontologies with an index of how many times such associations occur within the annotation GO’s hierarchy has thus far not been considered. Rather we have focused only on the terms themselves to which the annotations are made. For each GO term used for annotation and for each subsuming term in GO’s is_a hierarchy, we can establish the distance of the former from the latter. (Resnik 1995) has pointed out that the semantic similarity of terms as one traverses the hierarchical tree reduces by a factor of log(p(c)) where p(c) is the probability of finding a child for the term when seeking information. Table 3 thus represents a quantification of this semantic similarity, which can be used to extend the results presented here by using an approach similar to that advanced in (Azuahe and Bodenreider, 2004).
