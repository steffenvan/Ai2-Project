We introduce a method for transferring
annotation from a syntactically annotated
corpus in a source language to a target lan-
guage. Our approach assumes only that
an (unannotated) text corpus exists for the
target language, and does not require that
the parameters of the mapping between
the two languages are known. We outline
a general probabilistic approach based on
Data Augmentation, discuss the algorith-
mic challenges, and present a novel algo-
rithm for sampling from a posterior distri-
bution over trees.

<bodyText confidence="0.999925888888889">
Annotated corpora are valuable resources for Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) which often require
significant effort to create. Syntactically annotated
corpora – treebanks, for short – currently exist for a
small number of languages; but for the vast majority
of the world’s languages, treebanks are unavailable
and unlikely to be created any time soon.
The situation is especially difficult for dialectal
variants of many languages. A prominent exam-
ple is Arabic: syntactically annotated corpora ex-
ist for the common written variety (Modern Stan-
dard Arabic or MSA), but the spoken regional di-
alects have a lower status in written communication
and lack annotated resources. This lack of dialect
treebanks hampers the development of syntax-based
NLP tools, such as parsers, for Arabic dialects.
On the bright side, there exist very large anno-
tated (Maamouri et al., 2003, 2004a,b) corpora for
Modern Standard Arabic. Furthermore, unannotated
text corpora for the various Arabic dialects can also
be assembled from various sources on the Internet.
Finally, the syntactic differences between the Ara-
bic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic are rela-
tively minor (compared with the lexical, phonologi-
cal, and morphological differences). The overall re-
search question is then how to combine and exploit
these resources and properties to facilitate, and per-
haps even automate, the creation of syntactically an-
notated corpora for the Arabic dialects.
We describe a general approach to this problem,
which we call treebank transfer: the goal is to
project an existing treebank, which exists in a source
language, to a target language which lacks annotated
resources. The approach we describe is not tied in
any way to Arabic, though for the sake of concrete-
ness one may equate the source language with Mod-
ern Standard Arabic and the target language with a
dialect such as Egyptian Colloquial Arabic.
We link the two kinds of resources that are avail-
able – a treebank for the source language and an
unannotated text corpus for the target language –
in a generative probability model. Specifically, we
construct a joint distribution over source-language
trees, target-language trees, as well as parameters,
and draw inferences by iterative simulation. This al-
lows us to impute target-language trees, which can
then be used to train target-language parsers and
other NLP components.
Our approach does not require aligned data,
unlike related proposals for transferring annota-
tions from one language to another. For exam-
ple, Yarowksy and Ngai (2001) consider the transfer
of word-level annotation (part-of-speech labels and
bracketed NPs). Their approach is based on aligned

corpora and only transfers annotation, as opposed to
generating the raw data plus annotation as in our ap-
proach.
We describe the underlying probability model of
our approach in Section 2 and discuss issues per-
taining to simulation and inference in Section 3.
Sampling from the posterior distribution of target-
language trees is one of the key problems in iterative
simulation for this model. We present a novel sam-
pling algorithm in Section 4. Finally in Section 5 we
summarize our approach in its full generality.

2 The Probability Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998196875">
Our approach assumes that two kinds of resources
are available: a source-language treebank, and a
target-language text corpus. This is a realistic
assumption, which is applicable to many source-
language/target-language pairs. Furthermore, some
knowledge of the mapping between source-language
syntax and target-language syntax needs to be incor-
porated into the model. Parallel corpora are not re-
quired, but may help when constructing this map-
ping.
We view the source-language treebank as a se-
quence of trees S1,...,Sn, and assume that these
trees are generated by a common process from a
corresponding sequence of latent target-language
trees T1,...,Tn. The parameter vector of the pro-
cess which maps target-language trees to source-
language trees will be denoted by Ξ. The mapping
itself is expressed as a conditional probability distri-
bution p(Si  |Ti,Ξ) over source-language trees. The
parameter vector Ξ is assumed to be generated ac-
cording to a prior distribution p(Ξ  |ξ) with hyper-
parameter ξ, assumed to be fixed and known.
We further assume that each target-language tree
Ti is generated from a common language model Λ
for the target language, p(Ti  |Λ). For expository rea-
sons we assume that Λ is a bigram language model
over the terminal yield (also known as the fringe) of
Ti. Generalizations to higher-order n-gram models
are completely straightforward; more general mod-
els that can be expressed as stochastic finite au-
tomata are also possible, as discussed in Section 5.
Let t1,...,tk be the terminal yield of tree T. Then

where # marks the beginning of the string and $
marks the end of the string.
There are two options for incorporating the lan-
guage model Λ into the overall probability model.
In the first case – which we call the full model –
Λ is generated by an informative prior distribution
p(Λ  |λ) with hyper-parameter λ. In the second case
– the reduced model – the language model Λ is fixed.
The structure of the full model is specified graph-
ically in Figure 1. In a directed acyclic graphical
model such as this one, we equate vertices with ran-
dom variables. Directed edges are said to go from a
parent to a child node. Each vertex depends directly
on all of its parents. Any particular vertex is condi-
tionally independent from all other vertices given its
parents, children, and the parents of its children.
The portion of the full model we are interested in
is the following factored distribution, as specified by

<bodyText confidence="0.999872333333333">
In the reduced model, we drop the leftmost term/

<bodyText confidence="0.999984764705882">
The difference between the full model (1) and the
reduced model (2) is that the reduced model assumes
that the language model Λ is fixed and will not be
informed by the latent target-language trees Ti. This
is an entirely reasonable assumption in a situation
where the target-language text corpus is much larger
than the source-language treebank. This will typ-
ically be the case, since it is usually very easy to
collect large corpora of unannotated text which ex-
ceed the largest existing annotated corpora by sev-
eral orders of magnitude. When a sufficiently large
target-language text corpus is available, Λ is simply
a smoothed bigram model which is estimated once
from the target-language corpus.
If the target-language corpus is relatively small,
then the bigram model Λ can be refined on the ba-
sis of the imputed target-language trees. A bigram

model is simply a discrete collection of multinomial
distributions. A simple prior for Λ takes the form
of a product of Dirichlet distributions, so that the
hyper-parameter X is a vector of bigram counts. In
the full model (1), we assume X is fixed and set it to
the observed bigram counts (plus a constant) in the
target-language text corpus. This gives us an infor-
mative prior for Λ. If the bigram counts are suffi-
ciently large, Λ will be fully determined by this in-
formative prior distribution, and the reduced model
(2) can be used instead.
By contrast, usually very little is known a pri-
ori about the syntactic transfer model Ξ. Instead Ξ
needs to be estimated from data. We assume that Ξ
too is a discrete collection of multinomial distribu-
tions, governed by Dirichlet priors. However, unlike
in the case of Λ, the priors for Ξ are noninforma-
tive. This is not a problem, since a lot of informa-
tion about the target language is provided by the lan-
guage model Λ.
As one can see in Figure 1 and equation (1),
the overall probability model constrains the latent
target-language trees Ti in two ways: From the left,
the language model Λ serves as a prior distribution
over target-language trees. On the one hand, Λ is
an informative prior, based on large bigram counts
obtained from the target-language text corpus; on
the other hand, it only informs us about the fringe
of the target-language trees and has very little di-
rectly to say about their syntactic structure. From the
right, the observed source-language trees constrain
the latent target-language trees in a complementary
fashion. Each target-language tree Ti gives rise to a
corresponding source-language tree Si according to
the syntactic transfer mapping Ξ. This mapping is
initially known only qualitatively, and comes with a
noninformative prior distribution.
Our goal is now to simultaneously estimate the
transfer parameter Ξ and impute the latent trees Ti.
This is simplified by the following observation: if
T1,...,Tn are known, then finding Ξ is easy; vice
versa, if Ξ is known, then finding Ti is easy. Si-
multaneous inference for Ξ and T1,...,Tn is possible
via Data Augmentation (Tanner and Wong, 1987),
or, more generally, Gibbs sampling (Geman and Ge-
man, 1984).

3 Simulation of the Joint Posterior
Distribution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986933333333">
We now discuss the simulation of the joint poste-
rior distribution over the latent trees T1,...,Tn, the
transfer model parameter Ξ, and the language model
parameter Λ. This joint posterior is derived from the
overall full probability model (1). Using the reduced
model (2) instead of the full model amounts to sim-
ply omitting Λ from the joint posterior. We will deal
primarily with the more general full model in this
section, since the simplification which results in the
reduced model will be straightforward.
The posterior distribution we focus on is
p(T1,...,Tn,Λ,Ξ I S1,...,Sn,X,4), which provides
us with information about all the variables of inter-
est, including the latent target-language trees Ti, the
syntactic transfer model Ξ, and the target-language

language model A. It is possible to simulate this
joint posterior distribution using simple sampling-
based approaches (Gelfand and Smith, 1990), which
are instances of the general Markov-chain Monte
Carlo method (see, for example, Liu, 2001).
Posterior simulation proceeds iteratively, as fol-
lows. In each iteration we draw the three kinds of
random variables – latent trees, language model pa-
rameters, and transfer model parameters – from their
conditional distributions while holding the values of
all other variables fixed. Specifically:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995734777777778">
• Initialize A and &apos;E by drawing each from its
prior distribution.
• Iterate the following three steps:
1. Draw each Ti from its posterior distribu-
tion given Si, A, and &apos;E.
2. Draw A from its posterior distribution
given T1,...,Tn and λ.
3. Draw &apos;E from its posterior distribution
given S1,...,Sn, T1,...,Tn, and ξ.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970117647059">
This simulation converges in the sense that the draws
of T1,...,Tn, A, and &apos;E converge in distribution to
the joint posterior distribution over those variables.
Further details can be found, for example, in Liu,
2001, as well as the references cited above.
We assume that the bigram model A is a family of
multinomial distributions, and we write A(tj  |tj_1)
for the probability of the word tj following tj_1.
Using creative notation, A(·  |tj_1) can be seen as
a multinomial distribution. Its conjugate prior is
a Dirichlet distribution whose parameter vector λw
are the counts of words types occurring immediately
after the word type w of tj_1. Under the conven-
tional assumptions of exchangeability and indepen-
dence, the prior distribution for A is just a product of
Dirichlet priors. Since we employ a conjugate prior,
the posterior distribution of A

has the same form as the prior – it is likewise a prod-
uct of Dirichlet distributions. In fact, for each word
type w the posterior Dirichlet density has parameter
λw +cw, where λw is the parameter of the prior distri-
bution and cw is a vector of counts for all word forms
appearing immediately after w along the fringe of
the imputed trees.
We make similar assumptions about the syntactic
transfer model &apos;E and its posterior distribution, which
is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989402">
p(&apos;E  |S1,...,Sn,T1,...,Tn,A,λ,ξ)
= p(&apos;E  |S1,...,Sn,T1,...,Tn,ξ). (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999906">
In particular, we assume that syntactic transfer in-
volves only multinomial distributions, so that the
prior and posterior for &apos;E are products of Dirichlet
distributions. This means that sampling A and &apos;E
from their posterior distributions is straightforward.
The difficult part is the first step in each scan of
the Gibbs sampler, which involves sampling each
target-language latent tree from the corresponding
posterior distribution. For a particular tree Tj, the
posterior takes the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999384">
p(Tj  |S1,...,Sn,T1,...,Tj_1,Tj+1,...,Tn,A,&apos;E,λ,ξ)

OC p(Tj  |A) p(Sj  |Tj,&apos;E) (5)

4 Sampling from the Latent Tree Posterior
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968411764706">
We are faced with the problem of sampling Tj from
its posterior distribution, which is proportional to the
product of its language model prior p(Tj  |A) and
transfer model likelihood p(Sj  |Tj,&apos;E). Rejection
sampling using the prior as the proposal distribution
will not work, for two reasons: first, the prior is only
defined on the yield of a tree and there are poten-
tially very many tree structures with the same fringe;
second, even if the first problem could be overcome,
it is unlikely that a random draw from an n-gram
prior would result in a target-language tree that cor-
responds to a particular source-language tree, as the
prior has no knowledge of the source-language tree.
Fortunately, efficient direct sampling from the la-
tent tree posterior is possible, under one very rea-
sonable assumption: the set of all target-language
trees which map to a given source-language tree Sj

should be finite and representable as a packed for-
est. More specifically, we assume that there is a
compact (polynomial space) representation of po-
tentially exponentially many trees. Moreover, each
tree in the packed forest has an associated weight,
corresponding to its likelihood under the syntactic
transfer model.
If we rescale the weights of the packed forest so
that it becomes a normalized probabilistic context-
free grammar (PCFG), we can sample from this new
distribution (corresponding to the normalized likeli-
hood) efficiently. For example, it is then possible to
use the PCFG as a proposal distribution for rejection
sampling.
However, we can go even further and sample
from the latent tree posterior directly. The key
idea is to intersect the packed forest with the n-
gram language model and then to normalize the re-
sulting augmented forest. The intersection opera-
tion is a special case of the intersection construction
for context-free grammars and finite automata (Bar-
Hillel et al., 1961, pp. 171–172). We illustrate it here
for a bigram language model.
Consider the tree in Figure 2 and assume it is
a source-language tree, whose root is a clause (C)
which consists of a subject (S), verb (v) and object
(O). The subject and object are noun phrases consist-
ing of an adjective (a) and a noun (n). For simplicity,
we treat the part-of-speech labels (a, n, v) as termi-
nal symbols and add numbers to distinguish multiple
occurrences. The syntactic transfer model is stated
as a conditional probability distribution over source-
language trees conditional on target language trees.
Syntactic transfer amounts to independently chang-
ing the order of the subject, verb, and object, and
changing the order of adjectives and nouns, for ex-
ample as follows:

<equation confidence="0.999982846153846">

Under this transfer model, the likelihood of a target-
language tree [A v[S a1 n1][O n2 a2]] corresponding to
the source-language tree shown in Figure 2 is Ξ5 ×
Ξ7 × Ξ8. It is easy to construct a packed forest of all
target-language trees with non-zero likelihood that
give rise to the source-language tree in Figure 2.
Such a forest is shown in Figure 3. Forest nodes are
shown as ellipses, choice points as rectangles con-
nected by dashed lines. A forest node is to be un-
derstood as an (unordered) disjunction of the choice
points directly underneath it, and a choice point as
an (ordered, as indicated by numbers) conjunction
of the forest nodes directly underneath it. In other
words, a packed forest can be viewed as an acyclic
and-or graph, where choice points represent and-
nodes (whose children are ordered). As a simpli-
fying convention, for nodes that dominate a single
choice node, that choice node is not shown. The for-
est in Figure 3 represents SvO, SOv, and vSO permu-
tations at the sentence level and an, na permutations
below the two noun phrases. The twelve overall per-
mutations are represented compactly in terms of two
choices for the subject, two choices for the object,
and three choices for the root clause.

We intersect/compose the packed forest with the
bigram language model A by augmenting each node
in the forest with a left context word and a right pe-
ripheral word: a node N is transformed into a triple
(a,N,b) that dominates those trees which N domi-
nates in the original forest and which can occur after
a word a and end with a word b. The algorithm is
roughly1 as shown in Figure 5 for binary branching
forests; it requires memoization (not shown) to be
efficient. The generalization to forests with arbitrary
branching factors is straightforward, but the presen-
tation of that algorithm less so. At the root level, we
call forest_composition with a left context of #
(indicating the start of the string) and add dummy
nodes of the form (a,$,$) (indicating the end of the
string). Further details can be found in the prototype
implementation. Each node in the original forest is
augmented with two words; if there are n leaf nodes
in the original forest, the total number of nodes in
the augmented forest will be at most n2 times larger
than in the original forest. This means that the com-
pact encoding property of the packed forest (expo-
nentially many trees can be represented in polyno-
mial space) is preserved by the composition algo-

with a bigram language model appears in Figure 4,
which shows the forest that results from composing
the forest in Figure 3 with a bigram language model.
The result of the composition is an augmented
forest from which sampling is almost trivial. The
first thing we have to do is to recursively propagate
weights from the leaves upwards to the root of the
forest and associate them with nodes. In the non-
recursive case of leaf nodes, their weights are pro-
vided by the bigram score of the augmented forest:
observe that leaves in the augmented forest have la-
bels of the form (a,b,b), where a and b are terminal
symbols, and a represents the immediately preced-
ing left context. The score of such a leaf is sim-
ply A(b  |a). There are two recursive cases: For
choice nodes (and-nodes), their weight is the prod-
uct of the weights of the node’s children times a lo-
cal likelihood score. For example, the node (v,O,n)
in Figure 4 dominates a single choice node (not
shown, per the earlier conventions), whose weight
is A(a  |v) A(n  |a) Ξ7. For other forest nodes (or-
nodes), their weight is the sum of the weights of the
node’s children (choice nodes).
Given this very natural weight-propagation algo-
rithm (and-nodes correspond to multiplication, or-
nodes to summation), it is clear that the weight of the
root node is the sum total of the weights of all trees
in the forest, where the weight of a tree is the prod-

uct of the local likelihood scores times the language
model score of the tree’s terminal yield. We can
then associate outgoing normalized weights with the
children (choice points) of each or-node, where the
probability of going to a particular choice node from
a given or-node is equal to the weight of the choice
node divided by the weight of the or-node.
This means we have managed to calculate the
normalizing constant of the latent tree posterior (5)
without enumerating the individual trees in the for-
est. Normalization ensures that we can sample from
the augmented and normalized forest efficiently, by
proceeding recursively in a top-down fashion, pick-
ing a child of an or-node at random with probability
proportional to the outgoing weight of that choice.
It is easy to see (by a telescoping product argument)
that by multiplying together the probabilities of each
such choice we obtain the posterior probability of a
latent tree. We thus have a method for sampling la-
tent trees efficiently from their posterior distribution.
The sampling procedure described here is very
similar to the lattice-based generation procedure
with n-gram rescoring developed by Langkilde
(2000), and is in fact based on the same intersection
construction (Langkilde seems to be unaware that
the CFG-intersection construction from (Bar-Hillel
et al., 1961) is involved). However, Langkilde is in-
terested in optimization (finding the best tree in the
forest), which allows her to prune away less prob-
able trees from the composed forest in a procedure
that combines composition, rescoring, and pruning.
Alternatively, for a somewhat different but related
formulation of the probability model, the sampling
method developed by Mark et al. (1992) can be used.
However, its efficiency is not well understood.

We have described the special case of bigram
models, and pointed out how our approach
will generalize to higher-order n-gram models.
However, priors are not generally constrained
to be n-gram models; in fact, any stochastic
finite automaton can be employed as a prior,
since the intersection of context-free grammars
and finite automata is well-defined. However,
the intersection construction that appears to be
necessary for sampling from the posterior dis-
tribution over latent trees may be rather cum-
bersome when higher-order n-gram models or
more complex finite automata are used as pri-
ors.

• The inverse image of an observed tree under the
mapping from latent trees to observed trees can
be expressed in terms of a finite context-free
language, or equivalently, a packed forest.
The purpose of Gibbs sampling is to simulate the
posterior distribution of the unobserved variables in
the model. As the sampling procedure converges,
knowledge contained in the informative but struc-
turally weak prior Λ is effectively passed to the syn-
tactic transfer model Ξ. Once the sampling proce-
dure has converged to a stationary distribution, we
can run it for as many additional iterations as we
want and sample the imputed target-language trees.
Those trees can then be collected in a treebank, thus
creating novel syntactically annotated data in the tar-
get language, which can be used for further process-
ing in syntax-based NLP tasks.

Our approach assumes only that an (unannotated) text corpus exists for the target language, and does not require that the parameters of the mapping between the two languages are known.

The situation is especially difficult for dialectal variants of many languages. A prominent example is Arabic: syntactically annotated corpora exist for the common written variety (Modern Standard Arabic or MSA), but the spoken regional dialects have a lower status in written communication and lack annotated resources. This lack of dialect treebanks hampers the development of syntax-based NLP tools, such as parsers, for Arabic dialects. On the bright side, there exist very large annotated (Maamouri et al., 2003, 2004a,b) corpora for Modern Standard Arabic. Furthermore, unannotated text corpora for the various Arabic dialects can also be assembled from various sources on the Internet. Finally, the syntactic differences between the Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic are relatively minor (compared with the lexical, phonological, and morphological differences). The overall research question is then how to combine and exploit these resources and properties to facilitate, and perhaps even automate, the creation of syntactically annotated corpora for the Arabic dialects.
