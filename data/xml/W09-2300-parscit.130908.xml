The Third Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-3) was held on 5 June
2009 following the NAACL-HLT 2009 conference hosted by the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Like the first two SSST workshops in 2007 and 2008, it aimed to bring together researchers from
different communities working in the rapidly growing field of statistical, tree-structured models of
natural language translation.
We were honored to have Alfred V. Aho deliver this year’s invited keynote talk. Along with Lewis
and Stearns’ (1968) seminal “Syntax-directed transduction” introducing syntax-directed transduction
grammars or SDTGs—to which synchronous CFGs are also equivalent—the classic pair of Aho and
Ullman’s (1969) articles “Syntax-directed translations and the pushdown assembler” and “Properties
of syntax-directed translations” established the foundations of formal transduction approaches to
translation. The motivation behind their formal language theory work was compiler translation of
programming languages. But much of the current work at SSST reflects the evolution of those ideas into
today’s state-of-the-art approaches to modeling of syntax and structure in statistical machine translation
of human languages.
Nowhere is it better demonstrated that research is healthily driven by the pollination of ideas across
these disciplines. These formal language pioneers foresaw clearly the importance of formalizing
compositional models of transduction. But without empirical research across various natural languages,
formal language theorists would not perhaps have anticipated the wide applicability in human language
translation of an intermediate restricted class of transductions between the syntax-directed transductions
that can be described by SDTGs (or synchronous CFGs) at one extreme, and the very restricted
finite-state transductions that can be described by FSTs at the other—like the broad equivalence class
of inversion transductions that can be described by ITGs (which include synchronous/transduction
grammars whose rules are all binary rank, ternary rank, or monotonically straight or inverted in
reordering permutation). Nor might they have foreseen the success of the rich variety of statistical
machine learning techniques that have been developed to induce such synchronous/transduction
grammars, such as the techniques introduced by the hierarchical phrase-based translation approach.
As has so often happened over the years of cross-fertilization cycles between formal language and
natural language research, the theoretical and empirical lines of research provide mutual inspiration.
We selected ten papers for this year’s workshop. Studies on alignment ranged from the theoretical
(Søgaard) to data analysis (Nakazawa and Kurohashi; Søgaard and Kuhn; Jiang, Li, Yang and Zhao),
to empirical impact on actual translation performance (Saers and Wu; Hashimoto, Yamamoto, Okuma,
Sumita and Tokuda). New contributions to translation decoding included purely unsupervised methods
leveraging compositional structure constraints (Saers and Wu), methods using explicit syntactic
information (Chang, Tseng, Jurafsky and Manning; Khalilov, Fonollosa and Dras), as well as methods
attempting to blend the two (Hashimoto, Yamamoto, Okuma, Sumita and Tokuda; Hanneman and
Lavie). The program was rounded out by a paper considering the use of explicit syntax in automatic
evaluation (Wang, Zhao, Yang and Li).
We would like to thank our authors and our Program Committee for making this year’s SSST workshop
another success.
