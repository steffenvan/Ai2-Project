Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999854411764706">
The problem of word segmentation affects
all aspects of Chinese language processing,
including the development of text-to-speech
synthesis systems. In synthesizing a Hong
Kong Cantonese text, for example, words
must be identified in order to model fusion
of coda [p] with initial [h], and other similar
effects that differentiate word-internal
syllable boundaries from syllable edges that
begin or end words. Accurate segmentation
is necessary also for developing any list of
words large enough to identify the word-
internal cross-syllable sequences that must
be recorded to model such effects using
concatenated synthesis units. This paper
describes our use of the Segmentation
Corpus to constrain such units.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998084846153846">
What are the best units to use in building a fixed
inventory of concatenative units for an unlimited
vocabulary text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis
system for a language? Given a particular choice
of unit type, how large is the inventory of such
units for the language, and what is the best way
to design materials to cover all or most of these
units in one recording session? Are there effects
such as prosodically conditioned allophony that
cannot be modeled well by the basic unit type?
These are questions that can only be answered
language by language, and answering them for
Cantonese1 poses several interesting challenges.

One major challenge involves the definition
of the “word” in Cantonese. As in other varieties
of Chinese, morphemes in Cantonese are
typically monosyllabic and syllable structure is
extremely simple, which might suggest the
demi-syllable or even the syllable (Chu &amp;
Ching, 1997) as an obvious basic unit. At the
same time, however, there are segmental
“sandhi” effects that conjoin syllables within a
word. For example, when the morpheme 集
zaap6 2 stands as a word alone (meaning ‘to
collect’), the [p] is a glottalized and unreleased
coda stop, but when the morpheme occurs in the
longer word集合 zaap6hap6 (‘to assemble’),
the coda [p] often resyllabifies and fuses with
the following [h] to make an initial aspirated
stop. Accurate word segmentation at the text
analysis level is essential for identifying the
domain of such sandhi effects in any full-fledged
TTS system, whatever method is used for
generating the waveform from the specified
pronunciation of the word. A further challenge is
to find a way to capture such sandhi effects in
systems that use concatenative methods for
waveform generation.
This paper reports on research aimed at
defining an inventory of concatenative units for
Cantonese using the Segmentation Corpus, a
lexicon of 33k words extracted from a large
corpus of Cantonese newspaper texts. The
corpus is described further in Section 2 after an
excursus (in Section 1) on the problems posed
standard, and not the older Canton City one.

by the Cantonese writing system. Section 3
outlines facts about Cantonese phonology
relevant to choosing the concatenative unit, and
Section 4 calculates the number of units that
would be necessary to cover all theoretically
possible syllables and sequences of syllables.
The calculation is done for three models: (1)
syllables, as in Chu &amp; Ching (1997), (2) Law &amp;
Lee’s (2000) mixed model of onsets, rhymes,
and cross-syllabic rhyme-onset units, and (3) a
positionally sensitive diphone model. This
section closes by reporting how the number of
units in the last model is reduced by exploiting
the sporadic and systematic phonotactic gaps
discovered by looking for words exemplifying
each possible unit in the Segmentation Corpus.

1 The Cantonese writing system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939680851064">
The Cantonese writing system poses unique
challenges for developing online lexicons, not
all of which are related to the “foremost
problem” of word segmentation. These problems
stem from the long and rich socio-political
history of the dialect, which makes the writing
system even less regular than the Mandarin one,
even though Cantonese is written primarily with
the same logographs (“Chinese characters”).
The main problem is that each character has
several readings, and the reading cannot always
be determined based on the immediate context
of the other characters in a multisyllabic word.
For some orthographic forms, the variation is
stylistic. For example, the word 支援 ‘support’
can be pronounced zi1jyun4 or zi1wun4. But
for other orthographic forms, the variation in
pronunciation corresponds to different words,
with different meanings. For example, the
character sequence 正當 writes both the function
word zing3dong1 ‘while’ and the content word
zing3dong3 ‘proper’. Moreover, some words,
such as ko1 ‘to page, telephone’, ge3 (genitive
particle), and laa3 (aspect marker), have no
standard written form. In colloquial styles of
writing, these forms may be rendered in non-
standard ways, such as using the English source
word call to write ko1, or writing the particles
with special characters unique to Cantonese. In
more formal writing, however, such forms must
be left to the reader to interpolate from a
character “borrowed” from some other
morpheme. For example, ge3 (genitive particle)
might be written 的, a character which more
typically writes the morpheme dik1 in
muk6dik1 目的 ‘aim’, but which suggests ge3
because it also writes a genitive particle in
Mandarin (de in the Pinyin romanization). Thus,
的 has a reading dik1 that is etymologically
related to the Mandarin morpheme, but it also
has the etymologically independent reading ge3
because Cantonese readers can read texts written
in Mandarin as if they were Cantonese. Such
ambiguities of reading make the task of
developing online wordlists from text corpora
doubly difficult, since word segmentation is
only half the task.

2 The Segmentation Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968189655173">
The Segmentation Corpus is an electronic
database of around 33,000 Cantonese word types
extracted from a 1.7 million character corpus of
Hong Kong newspapers, along with a tokenized
record of the text. It is described in more detail
in Chan &amp; Tang (1999). The Cantonese corpus
is part of a larger database of segmented Chinese
texts, including Mandarin newspapers from both
the PRC and Taiwan. The three databases were
created using word-segmentation criteria
developed by researchers at the Chinese
Language Centre and Department of Chinese
and Bilingual Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic
University. Since these criteria were intended to
be applicable to texts in all three varieties, they
do not refer to the phonology.
For our current purpose, the most useful part
of the Segmentation Corpus is the wordlist
proper, a file containing a separate entry for each
word type identified by the segmentation criteria.
Each entry has three fields: the orthographic
form(s), the pronunciation(s) in Jyutping, and
the token frequency in the segmented newspaper
corpus. In the original corpus, the first field
could have multiple entries. For example, there
are two character strings, 泛濫 and 氾濫, in the
entry for the word faan6laam6 ‘to flood’.
However, the two readings of 支援 were not
listed separately in the pronunciation field for
that orthographic form (and there was only one
entry for the two words written with 正當).
Before we could use the wordlist, therefore,
we had to check the pronunciation field for each
entry. The first author, a native speaker of Hong
Kong Cantonese, examined each entry in order
to add variant readings not originally listed (as
in the entry for �ffl ‘support’) and to correct
readings that did not correspond to the modern
Hong Kong pronunciation (as in the entry for A
‘box’). In addition, when the added variant
pronunciation corresponded to an identifiably
different word (as in zing3dong3 ‘proper’
versus zing3dong1 ‘while’ for JE M ), the
entry was split in two, and all tokens of that
character string in the larger corpus were
examined, in order to allocate the total token
count for the orthographic form to the two
separate frequencies for the two different words.
Approximately 90 original entries were split into
separate entries by this processing. In this way,
the 32,840 entries in the original word list
became 33,037 entries. Once this task was
completed, we could use the wordlist to count
all of the distinct units that would be needed to
synthesize all of the words in the Segmentation
Corpus. To explain what these units are, we
need to describe the phonology of Cantonese
words and longer utterances.

3 Cantonese phonology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919743589744">
The smallest possible word is a nasal ([m] or
[xj]) or vowel as a bare tone-bearing syllable
nucleus, as in H ng5 ‘five’ andK aa2 ‘dumb’.
A syllable with a vowel as nucleus can also have
an onset consonant, and it can have a more
complex rhyme which combines the vowel with
any of the three coda nasals [m], [n], and [xj], the
two glides [j] and [w], or the three coda stops
[p], [t], and [k], as in ` zoeng1 ‘will’, &apos;ffl wai6
‘stomach’, and � leot2 ‘rate’. Tables 1 and 2
show the 11 vowels and 19 consonants of
Cantonese, and Figure 1 plots representative F0
contours for each of the tones that contrast on a
syllable with an all-sonorant rhyme.
If there were no phonotactic restrictions on
combinations of vowels and consonants, there
would be 101 distinct rhymes in each of the six
tones. However, not all combinations are
possible. For example, tone 5 does not occur on
syllables with coda stops (and tone 4 on such
checked syllables is limited to onomatopoeia).
Also, the mid short vowel [e] does not occur in
open syllables, and in closed syllables it occurs
only before [k], [xj], and [j], whereas [i:] occurs
in closed syllables only before [p], [t], [m], [n],
and [w]. The Jyutping transliteration system
takes advantage of this kind of complementary
distribution to limit the number of vowel
symbols. Thus “i” is used to transcribe both the
short mid vowel [e] in the rhymes [ek] and [exp],
and the high vowel [i:] in the rhymes [i:], [i:t],
[i:p], [i:m], [i:n], and [i:w]. Ignoring tone, there
are 54 rhyme types in standard usage of
Jyutping. Canonical forms of longer words can
be described to a very rough first approximation
as strings of syllables. However, fluent synthesis
cannot be achieved simply by stringing syllables
together without taking into account the effects
of position in the word or phrase.

One of these effects is the fusion of coda [p]
with initial [h] in words such as 集合 zaap6
hap6. In fluent connected speech, such effects
can be extreme. Consonants can be reduced or
deleted, with the abutting vowels fused together,
as in the pronunciation [jy:n21la:212] for the
phrase 原來係 jyun4loi4 hai6 ‘was’ (with
the verb cliticized onto the preceding tense
adverb) as in Figure 2. Eventually, we plan to
use the larger Segmentation Corpus to look for
likely targets of fusion. For now, however, we
focus on positional effects that can be modeled
just by recording word lists. Figure 2 illustrates
one such effect. The final syllable in this
utterance is sustained, to be longer than the other
four syllables combined. It also bears two extra
tone targets for the HL% boundary tone. (See
Wong, Chan &amp; Beckman, in press, for a
discussion of these utterance-level effects.)
Phrase-final lengthening is not usually so
extreme in read speech, and the inventory of
boundary tones is more limited. However, there
will be sufficient final lengthening to warrant the
recording of separate units for (the rhymes of)
final syllables. These two positional effects
increase the inventory of units, albeit in different
ways depending on the choice of “basic” unit.

4 Counting different unit types
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746030769231">
Table 3 illustrates three synthesis models using
the word 經 濟 ㈻ 家 ging1zai3hok6gaa1
‘economist’. The last column in Table 3 lists the
theoretically possible number of basic units. The
first model concatenates syllables. If each onset
could be combined with each rhyme, there
would be 1042 syllable types. A second set of
syllables can be recorded to capture final
lengthening. However, there is no comparably
obvious way to capture the cross-syllabic effects
with this concatenative unit. The second model
uses cross-syllabic units which combine the
rhyme of one syllable with the following initial.
This automatically captures the sandhi effects.
The model also captures final lengthening,
because separate units are recorded for onsets
with no preceding rhyme and rhymes with no
following onset. With 54 final rhymes, 1728
combinations of rhyme followed by medial
onset, and 19 initial onsets, there are 1801
theoretically possible units. The last model is
our diphone model, which differentiates codas
from onset consonants. That is, the rhyme aak$
is distinct from the cross-syllabic diphone aa$k.
This model has the advantage over Law &amp; Lee’s
cross-syllable final-initial combination model in
that spectral continuity between the initial and
rhyme is captured in the CV diphones (such as
#gi and zai). Similarly, the diphones capture
the dependency between the quality of the [h]
and that of the following vowel (i.e., one records
separate cross-syllable diphones for i$ho, i$hi,
i$haa, and so on). However, the number of
theoretically possible units is smaller, because
we do not record consonant sequences that abut
silence with silence — e.g., aak$ can be
combined directly with $ka or $ta, so no cross-
syllabic units need be recorded for k$k and k$t.
Note that none of these counts takes tone
into consideration. However, since every
syllable bears a (full) tone, and since tones are
rarely deleted in running speech, recording
different units for rhymes with different tones
should improve naturalness, particularly for
cases where voice quality is part of the tonal
specification (as suggested by the contour for
tone 4 in Figure 1). Naturalness may also require
different cross-syllabic units for different tone
sequences when sonorant segments abut at
syllable edges (so as to insure tonal continuity).
Of course, when tone specification is taken
into account, the number of necessary units
grows substantially. For example, there are
12,120 distinct syllables, and even more units in
the other two models. However, when we count
only those types that are attested in the words of
the Segmentation Corpus, there are many fewer
units. For example, the total number of attested
units taking tone into account in the diphone
model is 2292. If each diphone were recorded in
a disyllabic carrier word, a Cantonese speaker
could speak all of the words to make a new
voice in a single recording session. (For
comparison, the number of attested diphones
ignoring tone is 634.)

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999875">
We have shown one way of using a segmented
database to inform the design of a unit inventory
for TTS. We augmented the Segmentation
Corpus with transliterations that would let us
predict more accurately the pronunciation that a
Cantonese speaker adopting a careful speaking
style would be likely to produce for a character
sequence. Judgements about the phonology of
Cantonese, in combination with the augmented
wordlist, and the associated word frequency
data, can be used to assess the costs and likely
benefits of different strategies for unit selection
in Cantonese TTS. In particular, we present data
indicating the feasibility of a new diphone
selection strategy that finesses some of the
problems in modelling the interactions between
tone and segmental identity. It remains to be
demonstrated that this strategy can actually
deliver the results which it appears to promise.
This is our future work.

This section closes by reporting how the number of units in the last model is reduced by exploiting the sporadic and systematic phonotactic gaps discovered by looking for words exemplifying each possible unit in the Segmentation Corpus. 1 The Cantonese writing system The Cantonese writing system poses unique challenges for developing online lexicons, not all of which are related to the “foremost problem” of word segmentation. These problems stem from the</context>
