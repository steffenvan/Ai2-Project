<bodyText confidence="0.999933736842105">
The verb-noun sequence in Chinese often
creates ambiguities in parsing. These ambi-
guities can usually be resolved if we know
in advance whether the verb and the noun
tend to be in the verb-object relation or the
modifier-head relation. In this paper, we de-
scribe a learning procedure whereby such
knowledge can be automatically acquired.
Using an existing (imperfect) parser with a
chart filter and a tree filter, a large corpus,
and the log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) algo-
rithm, we were able to acquire verb-noun
pairs which typically occur either in verb-
object relations or modifier-head relations.
The learned pairs are then used in the pars-
ing process for disambiguation. Evaluation
shows that the accuracy of the original
parser improves significantly with the use of
the automatically acquired knowledge.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9998378">
Computer analysis of natural language sentences is
a challenging task largely because of the ambigui-
ties in natural language syntax. In Chinese, the
lack of inflectional morphology often makes the
resolution of those ambiguities even more difficult.
One type of ambiguity is found in the verb-noun
sequence which can appear in at least two different
relations, the verb-object relation and the modifier-
head relation, as illustrated in the following
phrases.

In (1), the verb-noun sequence “登记 手续” is an
example of the modifier-head relation while “办理
手续” in (2) is an example of the verb-object rela-
tion. The correct analyses of these two phrases are
given in Figure 1 and Figure 2, where “RELCL”
stands for “relative clause”:

<bodyText confidence="0.9982138">
However, with the set of grammar rules that
cover the above phrases and without any semantic
or collocational knowledge of the words involved,
there is nothing to prevent us from the wrong
analyses in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

To rule out these wrong parses, we need to
know that -RiE is a typical modifier of T while
),J,9 typically takes T as an object. The ques-
tion is how to acquire such knowledge automati-
cally. In the rest of this paper, we will present a
learning procedure that learns those relations by
processing a large corpus with a chart-filter, a tree-
filter and an LLR filter. The approach is in the
spirit of Smadja (1993) on retrieving collocations
from text corpora, but is more integrated with pars-
ing. We will show in the evaluation section how
much the learned knowledge can help improve
sentence analysis.

2 The Learning Procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948727272727">
The syntactic ambiguity associated with the verb-
noun sequence can be either local or global. The
kind of ambiguity we have observed in (1) and (2)
is global in nature, which exists even if this noun
phrase is plugged into a larger structure or com-
plete sentence. There are also local ambiguities
where the ambiguity disappears once the verb-
noun sequence is put into a broader context. In the
following examples, the sentences in (3) and (4)
can only receive the analyses in Figure 5 and Fig-
ure 6 respectively.

In the processing of a large corpus, sentences
with global ambiguities only have a random
chance of being analyzed correctly, but sentences
with local ambiguities can often receive correct
analyses. Although local ambiguities will create
some confusion in the parsing process, increase the
size of the parsing chart, and slow down process-
ing, they can be resolved in the end unless we run
out of resources (in terms of time and space) be-
fore the analysis is complete. Therefore, there
should be sufficient number of cases in the corpus
where the relationship between the verb and the
noun is clear. An obvious strategy we can adopt
here is to learn from the clear cases and use the
learned knowledge to help resolve the unclear
cases. If a verb-noun pair appears predominantly
in the verb-object relationship or the modifier head
relationship throughout the corpus, we should pre-
fer this relationship everywhere else.
A simple way to learn such knowledge is by us-
ing a tree-filter to collect all instances of each
verb-noun pair in the parse trees of a corpus,
counting the number of times they appear in each
relationship, and then comparing their frequencies
to decide which relationship is the predominant
one for a given pair. Once we have the informa-
tion that “-RiE” is typically a modifier of “T ”
and “),J,9” typically takes “T ” as an object, for
instance, the sentence in (1) will only receive the
analysis in Figure 1 and (2) only the analysis in
Figure 2. However, this only works in idealized
situations where the parser is doing an almost per-
fect job, in which case no learning would be neces-
sary. In reality, the parse trees are not always
reliable and the relations extracted from the parses
can contain a fair amount of noise. It is not hard to
imagine that a certain verb-noun pair may occur
only a couple of times in the corpus and they are
misanalyzed in every instance. If such noise is not
filtered out, the knowledge we acquire will mislead
us and minimize the benefit we get from this ap-
proach.
An obvious solution to this problem is to ignore
all the low frequency pairs and keep the high fre-
quency ones only, as wrong analyses tend to be
random. But the cut-off point is difficult to set if
we are only looking at the raw frequencies, whose
range is hard to predict. The cut-off point will be
too low for some pairs and too high for others. We
need a normalizing factor to turn the raw frequen-
cies into relative frequencies. Instead of asking
“which relation is more frequent for a given pair?”,
the question should be “of all the instances of a
given verb-noun pair in the corpus, which relation
has a higher percentage of occurrence?”. The
normalizing factor should then be the total count of
a verb-noun pair in the corpus regardless of the
syntactic relations between them. The normalized
frequency of a relation for a given pair is thus the
number of times this pair is assigned this relation
in the parses divided by this normalizing factor.
For example, if 登记 手续 occurs 10 times in the
corpus and is analyzed as verb-object 3 times and
modifier-head 7 times, the normalized frequencies
for these two relations will be 30% and 70% re-
spectively. What we have now is actually the
probability of a given pair occurring in a given re-
lationship. This probability may not be very accu-
rate, given the fact that the parse trees are not
always correct, but it should a good approximation,
assuming that the corpus is large enough and most
of the potential ambiguities in the corpus are local
rather than global in nature.
But how do we count the number of verb-noun
pairs in a corpus? A simple bigram count will un-
justly favor the modifier-head relation. While the
verb and the noun are usually adjacent when the
verb modifies the noun, they can be far apart when
the noun is the object of the verb, as illustrated in
(5).

“They are going through the procedures for
going to Taipei for the 19th International Con-
ference on Computational Linguistics.”
To get a true normalizing factor, we must count
all the potential dependencies, both local and long-
distance. This is required also because the tree-
filter we use to collect pair relations consider both
local and long-distance dependencies as well.
Since simple string matching is not able to get the
potential long-distance pairs, we resorted to the use
of a chart-filter. As the parser we use is a chart
parser, all the potential constituents are stored in
the chart, though only a small subset of those will
end up in the parse tree. Among the constituents
created in the chart for the sentence in (5), for in-
stance, we are supposed to find [办理] and [去台
湾参加第十九届国际计算语言学会议的手续]
which are adjacent to each other. The fact that 手
续 is the head of the second phrase then makes 手
续 adjacent to 办理. We will therefore be able to
get one count of 办理 followed by 手续 from (5)
despite the long span of intervening words between
them. The use of the chart-filter thus enables us to
make our normalizing factor more accurate. The
probability of a given verb-noun pair occurring in a
given relation is now the total count of this relation
in the parse trees throughout the corpus divided by
the total count of all the potential relations found in
all the charts created during the processing of this
corpus.
The cut-off point we finally used is 50%, i.e. a
pair+relation will be kept in our knowledge base if
the probability obtained this way is more than
50%. This may seem low, but it is higher than we
think considering the fact that verb-object and
modifier-head are not the only relations that can
hold between a verb and a noun. In (6), for exam-
ple, 办理 is not related to 手续 in either way in
spite of their adjacency.

“They went to Shanghai to handle the nota-
rized material needed for the procedure.”
We will still find the 办理 手续 pair in the
chart, but it is not expected to appear in either the
verb-object relation or modifier-head relation in
the parse tree. Therefore, the baseline probability
for any pair+relation might be far below 50% and
more than 50% is a good indicator that a given pair
does typically occur in a given relation. We can
also choose to keep all the pairs with their prob-
abilities in the knowledge base and let the prob-
abilities be integrated into the probability of the
complete parse tree at the time of parse ranking.
The results we obtained from the above proce-
dure are quite clean, in the sense that most of the
pairs that are classified into the two types of rela-
tions with a probability greater than 50% are cor-
rect. Here are some sample pairs that we learned.

However, there are pairs that are correct but not

...
These are truly verb-object relations, but we may
not want to keep them in our knowledge base for
the following reasons. First of all, the verbs in
such cases usually can take a wide range of objects
and the strength of association between the verb
and the object is weak. In other words, the objects
are not “typical”. Secondly, those verbs tend not
to occur in the modifier-head relation with a fol-
lowing noun and we gain very little in terms of
disambiguation by storing those pairs in the
knowledge base. To prune away those pairs, we
used the log-likelihood-ratio algorithm (Dunning,
1993) to compute the degree of association be-
tween the verb and the noun in each pair. Pairs
where there is high “mutual information” between
the verb and noun would receive higher scores
while pairs where the verb can co-occur with many
different nouns would receive lower scores. Pairs
with association scores below a certain threshold
were then thrown out. This not only makes the
remaining pairs more “typical” but helps to clean
out more garbage. The resulting knowledge base
therefore has higher quality.

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987204545455">
The knowledge acquired by the method described
in the previous section is used in subsequent sen-
tence analysis to prefer those parses where the
verb-noun sequence is analyzed in the same way as
specified in the knowledge base. When processing
a large corpus, what we typically do is analyzing
the corpus twice. The first pass is the learning
phase where we acquire additional knowledge by
parsing the corpus. The knowledge acquired is
used in the second pass to get better parses. This is
one example of the general approach of “improv-
ing parsing by parsing”, as described in (Wu et al
2002).
To find out how much the learned knowledge
contributes to the improvement of parsing, we per-
formed a human evaluation. In the evaluation, we
used our existing sentence analyzer (Heidorn 2000,
Jensen et al 1993, Wu and Jiang 1998) to process a
corpus of 271,690 sentences to learn the verb-noun
relations. We then parsed the same sentences first
without the additional knowledge and then with the
acquired knowledge. Comparing the outputs, we
found that 16,445 (6%) of the sentences had differ-
ent analyses in the two passes. We then randomly
selected 500 sentences from those “diff” sentences
and presented them to a linguist from an independ-
ent agency who, given two different parses of the
same sentence, was asked to pick the parse she
judged to be more accurate. The order in which
the parses were presented was randomized so that
the evaluator had no idea as to which tree was from
the first pass and which one from the second pass.
The linguist’s judgment showed that, with the
additional knowledge that we acquired, 350 (70%)
of those sentences parsed better with the additional
knowledge, 85 (17%) parsed worse, and 65 (13%)
had parses that were equally good or bad. In other
words, the accuracy of sentence analysis improved
significantly with the learning procedure discussed
in this paper.
Here is an example where the parse became bet-
ter when the automatically acquired knowledge is
used. Due to space limitation, only the parses of a
fraction of the sentence is given here:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9965242">

want follow nation testing standard
“(You) must follow the national testing
standards.”
Because of the fact that 遵照 is ambiguous be-
tween a verb (“follow”) and a preposition (“in ac-
cordance with”), this sentence fragment got the
parse tree in Figure 7 before the learned knowledge
was used, where 标准 was misanalyzed as the ob-
ject of 测试:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.995814">
Figure 7: old parse of (7)

<bodyText confidence="0.999821">
During the learning process, we acquired “测试-
标准” as a typical pair where the two words are in
the modifier-head relationship. Once this pair was
added to our knowledge base, we got the correct
parse, where 遵照 is analyzed as a verb and 测试
as a modifier of 标准:

<bodyText confidence="0.999990888888889">
We later inspected the sentences where the
parses became worse and found two sources for the
regressions. The main source was of course errors
in the learned results, since they had not been
manually checked. The second source was an en-
gineering problem: the use of the acquired knowl-
edge required the use of additional memory and
consequently exceeded some system limitations
when the sentences were very long.

<bodyText confidence="0.999591">
The approach described in this paper can be ap-
plied to the learning of many other typical syntac-
tic relations between words. We have already used
it to learn noun-noun pairs where the first noun is a
typical modifier of the second noun. This has
helped us to rule out incorrect parses where the
two nouns were not put into the same constituent.
Other relations we have been trying to learn in-
clude:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991440818181818">
• Noun-noun pairs where the two nouns are in
conjunction (e.g. 新郎 新娘 “bride and bride-
groom”);
• Verb-verb pairs where the two verbs are in
conjunction (e.g. 调查 研究 “investigate and
study”);
• Adjective-adjective pairs where two adjectives
are in conjunction (e.g. 年轻 漂亮 “young and
beautiful”);
• Noun-verb pairs where the noun is a typical
subject of the verb.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998296">
Knowledge of this kind, once acquired, will benefit
not only parsing, but other NLP applications as
well, such as machine translation and information
retrieval.
In terms of parsing, the benefit we get there is
similar to what we get in lexicalized statistical
parsing where parsing decisions can be based on
specific lexical items. However, the training of a
statistical parser requires a tree bank which is ex-
pensive to create while our approach does not. Our
approach does require an existing parser, but this
parser does not have to be perfect and can be im-
proved as the learning goes on. Once the parser is
reasonably good, what we need is just raw text,
which is available in large quantities.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996818181818">
We have shown in this paper that parsing quality
can be improved by using the parser as an auto-
matic learner which acquires new knowledge in the
first pass to help analysis in the second pass. We
demonstrated this through the learning of typical
verb-object and modifier-head relations. With the
use of a chart-filter, a tree-filter and the LLR algo-
rithm, we are able to acquire such knowledge with
high accuracy. Evaluation shows that the quality
of sentence analysis can improve significantly with
the help of the automatically acquired knowledge.

Figure 3. Wrong analysis of (1) Figure 4. Wrong analysis of (2) To rule out these wrong parses, we need to know that -RiE is a typical modifier of T while ),J,9 typically takes T as an object. The question is how to acquire such knowledge automatically. In the rest of this paper, we will present a learning procedure that learns those relations by processing a large corpus with a chart-filter, a treefilter and an LLR filter. The approach is in the spirit of Smadja (1993) on retrieving collocations from text corpora, but is more integrated with parsing. We will show in the evaluation section how much the learned knowledge can help improve sentence analysis. 2 The Learning Procedure The syntactic ambiguity associated with the verbnoun sequence can be either local or global. The kind of ambiguity we have observed in (1) and (2) is global in nature, which exists even if this noun phrase is plugged into a larger structure or complete sentence. There are also local ambiguities where the ambiguity disappears once the verbnoun sequence is put into a broader context. </context>

When processing a large corpus, what we typically do is analyzing the corpus twice. The first pass is the learning phase where we acquire additional knowledge by parsing the corpus. The knowledge acquired is used in the second pass to get better parses. This is one example of the general approach of “improving parsing by parsing”, as described in (Wu et al 2002). To find out how much the learned knowledge contributes to the improvement of parsing, we performed a human evaluation. In the evaluation, we used our existing sentence analyzer (Heidorn 2000, Jensen et al 1993, Wu and Jiang 1998) to process a corpus of 271,690 sentences to learn the verb-noun relations. We then parsed the same sentences first without the additional knowledge and then with the acquired knowledge. Comparing the outputs, we found that 16,445 (6%) of the sentences had different analyses in the two passes. We then randomly selected 500 sentences from those “diff” sentences and pr</context>
