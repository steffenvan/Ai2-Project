<bodyText confidence="0.999953392857143">
New types of text sources, multi-lingual, with numerous cooperating or even ad-
versarial authors and little or no editorial control are one effect of the recently
dramatically lowered publication threshold. Many contain linguistic items or
features classically associated with spoken language — combining the high in-
teractivity of dialogue with the low bandwidth of written text and with the
multicasting capabilities of digital communication.
New material published today most noticeably includes blogs — a genre that
has evolved from diaries, logbooks, commentaries, columns, and editorials into
a multi-faceted and networked churn of text with widely ranging viewpoints and
perspectives and varying application and ambition on the part of the creator.
One of the most noticeable charateristics of the blog genre is its opinionated
nature and its timeliness. Blog texts are often ill-edited and hastily cobbled
together in a language reminiscent of brief notes, spoken asides, or short letters,
rather than of essays or newsprint. This, at any rate, is the public perception.
Another emergent genre is that of the wiki, a shared workspace for many
more or less equal participants: wiki texts are written and edited by open teams
of authors. The best known application of the wiki is the wikipedia — closely
patterned on a classic text genre, that of the encyclopedia; other applications
include e.g. project management or creative text authoring. In contrast to
blogs, wikis (especially the wikipedia applications) tend to have high ambitions
as regards factual correctness, persistence, editorial quality, and trustworthiness.
Bridging the two are genres such as discussion boards, web fora, and mailing
lists.
Let us call these various new types of text (or indeed other modes of linguistic
communication) collectively NEw TEXT. This workshop is intended to discuss
the analysis and application of new text, formulate research measures that are
crying out to be taken, discuss which methodological steps are obsoleted, and
which babies can be saved from the bath water.

Challenge questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.883830125">
NEW TEXT provides a number of research issues, immediately obvious ques-
tions, and tentative applications for our research fields:
1. New possibilities for the philologically inclined: How does new text cast
new light on human communicative behaviour? This includes question on
style and genre: the characteristics of new text and relations to traditional
media. Do blogs in fact resemble spoken language in any important way?
Do wikis hold up their promise of qualitative information dissemination?
How has research in textuality, discourse and linguistic behaviour been
hindered by reliance on well-edited and well-groomed data sets? Or, in
more positive words: what advances can we expect, either in terms of
application or in terms of understanding human behaviour, by the new
data sources available to us now?
2. New challenges for building text analysis tools – how are the today’s algo-
rithms portable to new text? This includes questions on multilinguality,
code-switching, register variation, and formality melange apparent in new
text.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9969090625">
3. New challenges for evaluation methodologies for information access sys-
tems:
• Can new text, with dynamic information sources and streams of vari-
able quality and impact be plugged into relevance-oriented evaluation
frameworks without revising the target notion of text relevance?
• Some new texts have high social impact; some sink without a trace;
some have high import in tightly knit circles and communities. Tra-
ditional media have sales figures, citation indices, and distribution
analyses. How can the impact of new texts be analyzed?
• New texts have variable perceived intellectual status and quality –
how can it be measured and predicted?
4. New opportunities for new services – e.g. linking different types of text
in dynamic and interactive sessions of information refinement and elabo-
ration.
5. How new is ”new”? Didn’t we use to have new text before? What is the
difference between ”new” and ”old”, really?
