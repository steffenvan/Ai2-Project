When a document is to appear in several dialects or
closely related langu,ges, there are many practical reasons
for adapting it from one to another rather than preparing
separate translations. However, manual adaption can be
tedious, errorful, and requires a bidialectal adaptor (often
unavailable) and/or qualified linguist (if available, very
expensive). Computer-aided adaption might be an
alternative, but is it feasible to write a computer program
which contributes enough to be worth the bother and cost?
This paper describes an experiment in computationally
assisting the adaption of text from one dialect of central
Peruvian Quechua (a polysynthetic. agglutinative, American
Indian language) to several others. The overall results are
extremely encouraging: computer-aided dialect adaption is
feasible and has important advantages over entirely manual
methods.
Below we describe the dialect situation, the data and
processes of the experimental program, and a field test of
text produced by the program.
Six dialects differing phonologically, lexically, and
grammatically were involved. The rich diversity of
differences are dominated by a few kinds of systematic
difference. The program treats these classes of difference
separately rather than by a single method (such as string
substitution); this requires a detailed analysis of the source
dialect text.
Examples of the kinds of differences involved:
Phonological: the reflexes of four proto-Quechua (&apos;Q)
phonemes (&apos;/W/e/*/Anit/) --in the government-mandated

Lexical: &apos;to get well/recover from an illness&apos; is
expressed with the root allchaka:- in Huallaga, alive:- in
Llata, and kachaka:- in Junin.
Grammatical: 1) Morphological: a suffix may be present
In one dialect and absent in another; the forms or properties
of corresponding suffixes may differ across dialects; there
are different systems of indicating plurality within the
verb: in some dialects there are 3-3 distinct pluralizers
occurring in different &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; and conditioned by what other
suffixes occur in the word: in others there is only one
pluralizer which has a fixed position; 2) Syntactic: the
complements of phasal verbs (&apos;begin&apos;, are
subordinated as adverbial clauses in some dialects but as
infinitival (object) clauses in others.
For the source dialect (SD) is provided a root dictionary
and a suffix dictionary; each entry contains the string of
characters by which that morpheme is recognized,
morphological category. morphophonemic properties,... and
for roots, the *(,) form. For each target dialect (TD) is
provided a suffix dictionary, a list of the regular sound
changes (11SC&apos;s) which when applied to a 2Ci root will yield
the correct TI) reflex, and a list of pairs of roots not cognate
in the SD and TI).
A TD root dictionary is computationally derived by 1)
applying the HSC&apos;s to the *C1 form of each SD root and 2)
substituting the TD root for non-cognate root pairs.
Text is adapted word by word, first analyzing SD words
and then synthesizing TD words. (An early pencil-and-paper
experiment suggested that for Quechua, word-by-word
methods could effect approximately 95Y- of the required
changes.) After orthographic adjustments, a simple,
recursive, exhaustive search attempts to decompose each
word into a root and zero or more suffixes by matching the
word&apos;s characters to the strings of characters of dictionary
entries subject to constraints of a built-in morphology. Tests
are applied 1) during the search to teat the suitability of a
matching suffix as the immediate successor to what
precedes, and Z) after all the word is matched to morphemes
to test the overall suitability of that sequence of morphemes.
These tests constrain possible decompositions to within
managable limits. Word decomposition is complicated by
various morphophonemic processes.
Pluralization differences are accommodated by 1)
tagging as plural each decomposition which contains a plural
morpheme, 2) deleting that plural morpheme, and 3)
inserting the appropriate pluralizer for the TD word.
Synthesis of a TD word proceeds by 1) substituting the
SD root by the corresponding TD root from the
computationally derived TI) root dictionary, 2) selecting for
each morpheme the correct allomorph, 3) concatenation of
the allomorphs, and 4) orthographic adjustment. Examples
are shown in Figure 1.
Many words have multiple decompositions but this is
tolerable because synthesis of alternative decompositions of
one SD word usually yield identical T1) words. Nonidentical
alternatives for one SD word are left to the choice of the
human editor/checker.
About 40 pages of text were adapted into each of 5
target dialects for use in the field test. Sampling indicates
that the computer correctly changed about 760 morphemes
per 1000 words of text; in the worst case native speakers

suggested about 190 additional changes per 1000 words. The
computer converted text which otherwise would have been
at best only marginally intelligible to a speaker of another
dialect into --with a few exceptions-- fully comprehensible
text. Thus the program brings a text being adapted close
enough to the TD that it can be edited/corrected by a native
speaker of the TD without much coaching or reference to the
SD text.
Since inevitably there is a non-trivial residue of
changes Infeasible for the computer, its output requires
subsequent manual correcting/editing. Therefore, rather
than strive to make the program do everything imaginable, it
is wise to do the overwhelming number of systemic, &amp;quot;low
level&amp;quot; changing and not unduly complicate the program to
accommodate too much. The test identified many relatively
infrequent changes not handled by the present program. For
most of them, computational adaption is not feasible. These
are discussed in a version of this paper which has been
published by Notes a j.imeuistics, SIL. It is available from
The International Linguistics Center, 7500 Camp Wisdom
Road, Dallas TX 75236 for 3.75 , as Special Publication 1,
Prospects for Computer-Assisted Dialect Adaption.
Conclusion: A computer can contribute significantly to
adaption between dialects or closely related languages.
