ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9995247">
Cue phrases are words and phrases such as now and by the
way which may be used to convey explicit information
about the structure of a discourse. However, while cue
phrases may convey discourse structure, each may also be
used to different effect. The question of how speakers
and hearers distinguish between such uses of cue phrases
has not been addressed in discourse studies to date. Based
on a study of now in natural recorded discourse, we pro-
pose that cue and non-cue usage can be distinguished into-
nationally, on the basis of phrasing and accent.

Cue phrases are linguistic expressions -- such as okay, but,
now, anyway, by the way, in any case, that reminds me --
which may, instead of making a `semantic&apos; contribution to
an utterance (i.e., affecting its truth conditions), be used
to convey explicit information about the structure of a
discourse [4], [16], [5].l For example, anyway can indi-
cate a topic return and that reminds me can signal a digres-
sion. The recognition and generation of cue phrases is of
considerable interest to research in natural language pro-
cessing. The structural information conveyed by these
phrases is crucial to tasks such as anaphora resolution [6],
[5], [16] and the identification of rhetorical relations
among portions of a text or discourse [11], [8], [16]. It
has also been claimed that the incorporation of cue phrases
into natural language processing systems helps reduce the
complexity of discourse processing [21], [4], [10].
Despite the recognized importance of cue phrases, many
questions about how they are defined both individually
and as a class -- and how they are to be represented, gen-
erated, and recognized -- remain to be examined. For
example, in the general case, each lexical item that can
serve as a &apos;cue phrase&apos; also has an alternate interpreta-
tion.2 While the `cue&apos; interpretation provides explicit
1. Previous literature has employed the terms &apos;clue word&apos;, &apos;discourse
marker&apos; or &apos;discourse particle&apos; for these items [16], [4], [14], [18].
More recently Grosz and Sidner [5] have proposed the term cue
phrase for these items, which we will adopt in this paper.
2. If &apos;non-lexical&apos; items such as uh are classed as cue phrases, then
this generalization may not hold for all cue phrases. However,
information about the structure of a discourse, the ton-
cue&apos; interpretation provides quite different information,
such as conjunction (but) or adverbial modification (any-
way). Distinguishing between these two uses is critical to
the interpretation of discourse. In this paper, we address
the problem of how this distinction might be made. We
propose that, in speech, this distinction is made intona-
tionally. We support our hypothesis by an analysis of cue
and non-cue uses of the item now in recorded naturally
occurring discourse.
In Section 2 we discuss the general problem of distinguish-
ing between cue and non-cue usage and consider possible
alternatives to our hypothesis. In Section 3 we present
relevant aspects of the theory of English intonation
assumed here for our analysis [13], [9]. Section 4
describes our data, presents the results of our analysis,
and along with Section 5, discusses the implications of our
results for the identification of cue phrases in general --
both in speech and in written text.

2. The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991153833333333">
Previous definitions of cue phrases as a class have been
extensional and definitions of particular cue phrases pro-
cedural. For example, now signals a &apos;push&apos; or &apos;pop&apos; [5] of
the attentional stack or &apos;further development&apos; of a previ-
ous context [16]. Despite some recognition [5] that cue
phrases are not always employed as cue phrases, no
attempt has been made to discover how &apos;cue&apos; uses of cue
phrases are distinguished from `non-cue&apos; uses. When does
now, for example, function as a discourse marker and
when is it deictic?
Roughly, the non-cue or deictic use of now makes refer-
ence to a span of time which minimally includes the utter-
ance time. This time span may include little more than
moment of utterance, as in 1, or it may be of indeter-
minate length, as in 2.3
even uh appears to have both &apos;cue&apos; and &apos;non-cue&apos; uses; i.e., it may
signal a digression or interruption, or it may simply serve as a
pause filler.

Fred: Yeah I think we&apos;ll look that up and possibly
uh after one of your breaks Harry.
Harry: OK we&apos;ll take one now. Just hang on Bill
and we&apos;ll be right back with you.
Harry: You know I see more coupons now than I&apos;ve
ever seen before and I&apos;ll bet you have too.
In contrast, the cue use of now signals a return to a previ-
ous topic, as in the two examples of now in 3, or intro-
duces a subtopic, as in 4.
Harry:Fred whatta you have to say about this IRA
problem?
Fred: Ok. You see now unfortunately Harry as

property and uh he was reimbursed for that

would he where would we put that on the
form?
reasonable to propose that deictic now occurs only when
the verb modified by now (or the main verb of the clause
so modified) is temporally compatible -- i.e., non-past.
For example, using the past tense in 1 -- we took one now
-- seems distinctly odd. However, we took one just now is
clearly felicitous. So, both cue and non-cue now are possi-
ble when the main verb is in the past tense. As examples
1- 3 above illustrate, both are also possible when the main
verb is in the present tense. So, tense is clearly inade-
quate to distinguish between cue and non-cue uses of now.
Another possible diagnostic for non-cue now might be
some notion of the general felicity of temporal reference
in an utterance -- which might correspond to the felicity of
substituting other temporal adverbials for now. For exam-
ple, we&apos;ll take one in an hour would be felicitous in 1, as
would I see more coupons these days in 2. Substituting
other temporals for now in either example 3 (Today the the
five thousand that you&apos;re alluding to...) or example 4 (Mon-
day where would he where would we put that on the form?)
would be infelicitous. However, this is only a necessary --
but not a sufficient -- test for deictic now. While a tem-
poral adverbial may be substituted for now in 5 (e.g.,
Today I have a profit sharing coming to me), both cue and
non-cue interpretations appear equally plausible from the
transcription, as noted above. In fact, listeners have no
hesitation in labeling this a cue now.
A third possibility is that hearers use surface order posi-
tion to distinguish cue from non-cue uses. In fact, most
systems that generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usu-
ally first) position within the clause [16], (21]. However,
without intonational information, surface position may
itself be unclear. Consider Example 6:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.810673888888889">
6.
While the distinction between cue and non-cue now seems
fairly clear in the above examples, other cases are more
difficult. Consider 5:

Ethel: All right I have just retired from a position
that I&apos;ve been in for forty some odd years. I

, sharing coming to me. My problem is shall I
take the ten year averaging...
From the transcription alone, either a cue or a non-cue
interpretation is plausible. The caller might have a profit
sharing due her at the moment of utterance (non-cue).
Or, she might be using now to mark profit sharing as a
subtopic (cue) -- leaving the time of the profit sharing
unspecified.
How then do hearers distinguish cue from non-cue uses?
One might propose that hearers use tense to delimit cases
in which deictic now is possible. That is, it would seem
Evelyn: I see. So in other words I will have to pay
the full amount of the uh of the tax now
what about Pennsylvania state tax? Can you
give me any information on that?
Although a cue reading is possible, most readers would
assign now a non-cue interpretation if it is associated with
the preceding clause, I will have to pay the full amount of
the...tax now -- but a cue interpretation if it is associated
with the succeeding clause, Now what about Pennsylvania
state tax?. The actual recording of 6 clearly supports the
latter interpretation: the strong intonational boundary
between tax and now identifies the clausal boundary --
and, thus, indirectly, the surface position of now within its
clause. Similarly, 7 would be ambiguous between a cue
reading, Well now, you&apos;ve got another point, and a deictic
reading, Well, now you&apos;ve got another point -- without into-
national cues:

give to charity you claim.
Linda:(laughs) I don&apos;t want the hassle of an of an
Fred: Well now you&apos;ve got another point and I
think at at times the service counts on the
fact that people don&apos;t want the hassle --
and maybe we as Americans have to stand
up a little bit more and claim what&apos;s due us.
Here it is clear from the recording that Fred intended the
deictic use. Later, we will present evidence from our
corpus that cue now can appear clause-finally, and non-cue
now, clause-initially. So, surface position also appears
inadequate to distinguish cue from non-cue now.
Finally, hearers might use syntactic information to
discriminate between cue and non-cue usage. At least for
now, this seems unlikely. Both cue and non-cue now&apos;s are
commonly classed as adverbials. So syntactic category
does not differentiate. Furthermore, both can be attached
at the sentence level. While non-cue now may also modify
VP, it is difficult to imagine attaching cue now at that
level -- since, by definition, it can make no &apos;semantic&apos; con-
tribution to either S or VP. However, this potential
attachment distinction does not provide a means of distin-
guishing cue from non-cue now -- rather, attachment possi-
bilities must be based on the prior cue/ non-cue distinc-
tion. So, syntactic structure provides no useful clues to
the identification of cue versus non-cue usage in this case.
In summary, neither tense, nor the &apos;appropriateness&apos; of
temporal modification (or lack thereof), nor surface posi-
tion, nor syntactic structure provides adequate information
for distinguishing between cue and non-cue now. As we.
will show in the remainder of this paper, however, intona-
tional features do provide such information.
which are aligned with stressed syllables (with alignment
indicated by *) on the basis of the metrical pattern of the
text and signify intonational prominence, and a simple
high (H) or low (L) tone that represents the phrase
accent. The phrase accent controls the pitch between the
last pitch accent of the current intermediate phrase and the
beginning of the next -- or the end of the utterance. Into-
national phrases are larger phonological units, composed
of one of more intermediate phrases. At the end of an
intonational phrase, a boundary tone, which may also be
H or L and is indicated by &apos;%&apos;, falls exactly at the phrase
boundary. So, each intonational phrase ends with a
phrase accent and a boundary tone.
A phrase&apos;s tune, or melody, has as its domain the intona-
tional phrase. It is defined by the sequence of pitch
accent(s), phrase accent(s), and boundary tone of that
phrase. For example, an ordinary declarative pattern with
a final fall is represented as H* L L% -- that is, a tune
with H* pitch accent(s), a L phrase accent, and a L%
boundary tone. Consider the pitch track in Figure 1
representing a simple intonational phrase composed of one
intermediate phrase and with a typical declarative contour.
(For ease of comparison of intonational features here, we
present pitch contours of synthetic speech, produced with
the Bell Labs Text-to-Speech System [12]. The analysis
we will present in Section 4 is based upon recorded natural
speech.)

The importance of intonational information to the com-
munication of discourse structure has been recognized in a
variety of studies [7], [20], [2], [17], [1]. However, just
which intonational features are important and how they
communicate discourse information is not well understood.
Under-utilization of objective measures of intonational
features in empirical research and the lack of a sufficiently
explicit system for intonational description have made it
difficult to compare and evaluate specific claims. For our
study we have examined fundamental frequency (FO) con-
tours produced using an autocorrelation pitch tracker
developed by Mark Liberman. As a system of intona-
tional description, we have adopted Pierrehumbert&apos;s [13]
theory of English intonation.
In Pierrehumbert&apos;s system, intonational contours are
described as sequences of low (L) and high (H) tones in
the FO (fundamental frequency) contour. A well-formed
intermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents,

All the pitch accents in this phrase, including the nuclear
accent -- the primary stressed syllable -- are high (H*).
The phrase accent is L and the boundary tone is also low
(L%).
A given sentence may be uttered with considerable varia-
tion in phrasing. For example, in Figure 1 Now let&apos;s talk
about &apos;now&apos; was produced as a single intonational phrase,
whereas in Figure 2 Now is set off as a separate phrase.

two simple tones -- H and L -- and four complex ones --
L*+H, L+H*, H*+L, and H+L*. The most common
accent, H*, comes out as a peak on the accented syllable

the pitch range than H* and are phonetically realized as
local f0 minima. The accent on Now in Figure 4 is a L*.

Pitch accents, peaks or valleys in the FO contour which
fall on the stressed syllables of lexical items, make those
items intonationally prominent. In Figure 3, the first
instance of now has no pitch accent, while the second
receives nuclear stress. (In our notation, the absence of a
specified accent indicates that a word is not accented.)

4. Intonational Characteristics of Cue and Non-Cue Now
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999654076923077">
To investigate our hypothesis that cue and non-cue uses of
linguistic expressions can be distinguished intonationally,
we conducted a study of the cue phrase now in recorded
natural speech. Our corpus consisted of recordings of four
days of &amp;quot;The Harry Gross Show: Speaking of Your
Money&amp;quot;, recorded during the week of 1 February 1982
[15]. In this Philadelphia radio call-in program, Gross
offers financial advice to callers; for the 3 February show,
he was joined by an accountant friend, Fred Levy. The
four shows provided approximately ten hours of conversa-
tion between expert(s) and callers.
We chose now to begin our study of cue phrases for
several reasons. First, our corpus contained numerous
instances of both cue and non-cue now (approximately 350
in all). In contrast, phrases such as anyway, anyhow,
therefore, moreover, and furthermore appear fewer than ten
times each. A second reason for our choice of now is that
now often appears in conjunction with other cue phrases
(as with well in 7, or I see now, now another thing, ok now,
right now.) This allows us to study how adjacent cue
phrases interact with one another. Third, now has a
number of desirable phonetic characteristics. As it is
monosyllabic, possible variation in stress patterns do not
arise to complicate the analysis. Because it is completely
voiced and introduces no segmental effects into the f0 con-
tour, it is also easier to analyze pitch tracks reliably.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99708">
4.1 Sample One
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.918387893617021">
Our first sample consisted of 48 occurrences of now -- all
the instances from two sides of tapes of the show chosen
at random.5 The 48 tokens were produced by fifteen dif-
ferent speakers; 22.9% were produced by Harry Gross
and 77.1% by other speakers.
We analyzed this data in the following way: First, three
people (including the authors) determined by ear whether
individual tokens were cue or non-cue. We then digitized
and pitch-tracked the intonational phrase containing each
token, plus (where same speaker) the preceding and
succeeding intonational phrases. For this study we com-
pared cue and non-cue uses along several dimensions: 1)
We examined whether each instance of now was accented
and, if so, noted the type of accent employed. 2) We
identified differences in phrasing, including in particular
whether or not now represented an entire intermediate or
intonational phrase. 3) We noted where now occurred
positionally in its intonational and its intermediate phrase,
4. The pitch range of an intonational phrase is defined by its topline
— roughly, the highest peak in the f0 contour of the phrase — and
the speaker&apos;s baseline — the lowest point the speaker realizes in
normal speech, measured across all utterances. Since the baseline
is rarely realized in an utterance, pitch ranges may be compared
for a given speaker by comparing toplines.
5. Two instances were excluded from this sample since the phrasing
was unavailable due to hesitation or interruption.
whether first, not first but preceded only by other cue
phrases, last, or none of these. 4) We looked at the type
of intonational contour used over the phrase in which now
occurred. 5) We noted when now occurred with (linearly
adjacent to) other cue phrases. 6) We identified the posi-
tion of the phrase containing now with respect to speaker
turn. Of these, (1-3) turned out to distinguish between
cue and non-cue now quite reliably. That is, accent type
and phrasing distinguished between all 48 of the tokens in
the sample.
Just over one-third of our sample (17) were determined to
be non-cue and just under two-thirds (31) cue. The first
striking difference between the two appeared in phrasing,
as illustrated in Table 1: Of all the non-cue uses of now,
none appeared as the only item in an intonational or inter-
mediate phrase, while fully 42.0% of cue now represented
entire intonational or intermediate phrases. (Of these 13
cue now&apos;s, 8 were tip only lexical item in a full intona-
tional phrase.) A x`&apos; test of association between cue/non-
cu s status and phrasing shows significance at the .005 level
(x‘(1)=9.8).6 So, this sample suggests that now&apos;s which

Another clear distinction between cue and non-cue now&apos;s
in this sample emerged when we examined the position of
now within its intermediate phrase. As Table 2 illustrates,
all 31 cue now&apos;s were &apos;first&apos; (30 were absolutely first and

6. The x2 test measures the degree of association between two vari-
ables by calculating the probability (p) that the disparity between
expected and actual values in each cell is due to chance. The value
of x2 itself for (n) degrees of freedom (d.f.) is an overall measure
of this disparity. The data show in Table 1 have x2 •• 9.8 for 1

this apparent association is due to chance. Roughly, p &lt; .01 or

&gt; .01 becomes more controversial; p &gt; .05 is generally considered
not statistically significant; and p &gt; .2 is good indication of a lack
of discernible association between two variables. So, the data in

one followed another cue phrase) in their phrase. Not only
were these first in intermediate phrase -- they were also
first in their (larger) intonational phrase. Only three
non-cue now&apos;s occupied a similar position (again, with one
following a cue phrase). However, 10 non-cue now&apos;s
(58.8%) were last in their intermediate phrase -- and half
of these were last in their intonational phase. Again, the
data show a very strong association (x4(2)=36.0, p &lt;
.001). So, once intonational phrasing is determined, cue
and non-cue now are generally distinguishable by position
within the phrase, with cue now&apos;s tending to come first in
intonational phrase and non-cue now&apos;s last (at least in
intermediate phrase and often in intonational phrase as
well).
Finally, cue and non-cue occurrences in this sample were
distinguishable in terms of presence or absence of pitch
accent -- and by type of pitch accent, where accented.
Because of the large number of possible accent types, and
since there are competing reasons to accent or deaccent
items,7 we might expect these findings to be less clear
than those for phrasing. In fact, although their interpreta-
tion is more complicated, the results are equally striking.
The overall results of the 46 occurrences from this sample
for which accent type could be precisely determinedg are
presented in Table 3:

Note first that large numbers of cue and non-cue tokens
were uttered with a H* or complex accent (34.5% of cue
and fully 88.2% of non-cue). The chief similarity here
lies in the use of the H* accent type, with 9 cue uses and
8 non-cue (and 2 other non-cue tokens are either H* or
complex). Note also that cue now&apos;s were much more
likely overall to be deaccented (44.8% vs. 13.3%). No
non-cue now was uttered with a L* accent -- although 6
cue now&apos;s were.
An even sharper distinction in accent type is found if we
separate out those now&apos;s which form entire intermediate or
intonational phrases from the analysis. (Recall that these
tokens are all cue uses. These now&apos;s were always
accented, since each such phrase must contain at least one
pitch accent.) Of the 11 cue phrases representing entire
phrases (and for which we can distinguish accent type pre-

8. 2 cue now&apos;s were either I.* or IP with a compressed pitch range
-- might disappear if we limit our comparison to those
now&apos;s forming part of larger intonational phrases. In fact,
such is the case, as illustrated in Table 4:

Again, these results are significant at the .001 level,
x4(2)=28.1. The great majority (88.2%) of non-cue now&apos;s
forming part of larger intonational phrases received a H*
or complex pitch accent, while the majority (72.2%) of
cue now&apos;s forming part of larger intonational phrases were
deaccented. Since all other cue now&apos;s forming part of
larger intonational phrases received a L* accent, only two
now&apos;s forming part of larger intonational phrases are not
distinguishable in terms of accent type -- the two deac-
cented non-cue now&apos;s. So, those cue now&apos;s not distinguish-
able from non-cue by being set apart as separate intona-
tional phrases were generally so distinguishable in terms of
accenting. Since neither of the deaccented non-cue now&apos;s
appeared at the beginning of an intonational phrase -- as
all cue now&apos;s did -- all of the instances of now in our sam-
ple were in fact distinguishable as cue or non-cue in terms
of their position in phrase, phrasal compostion, and
accent.
We also examined whether cue and non-cue now patterned
differently in terms of appearance with other cue phrases,
with the following results:

Somewhat counter-intuitively, non-cue nosy tended to
appear more frequently than cue now with other cue
phrases -- although generally these other cue phrases were
also used in their non-cue sense, e.g., right now. The
cogccurrence is not, however, statistically significant
(x4(1)=1.6, p &gt; .2). At any rate, the possibility that
listeners identify cue now by its co-occurrence with other
cue phrases receives no support from our data. Examina-
tion of the intonational contour used with phrases contain-
ing cue and non-cue now, and of the location of these
phrases within speaker turn also produced no significant
results.
So, we were able to hypothesize from this sample that cue
and non-cue now are characterizable in the following ways:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996393">
168
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999466115384615">
Non-cue now forms part of larger intonational phrases and
tends to be accented and to receive a H* or complex pitch
accent. All non-cue uses in the sample did form part of
larger intonational phrases and all but two -- which were
deaccented -- were accented with a H* or complex accent.
Cue now seems to form two classes: One class is generally
set apart as a separate intermediate or intonational phrase.
Something under half of our sample fell into this category.
The other class, which constituted just over half of our
sample, forms part of a larger intonational phrase and is
either deaccented or uttered with a L* accent. Both
classes share the property of appearing in initial intona-
tional phrase position.
In summary, non-cue now is always distinct from cue now
in our sample in terms of a combination of accent type,
position in intonational phrase, and overall composition of
the intermediate or intonational phrase. Thus we
hypothesize that hearers might be able to distinguish
between the two uses of now in three- ways: by noting
whether now formed a separate intermediate (or
intonational) phrase, by locating now positionally within
its intonational phrase, and by identifying the presence or
absence of a pitch accent on now and the type of such
accent where present. To test the validity of these
hypotheses, we replicated our study with a second sample
from the same corpus.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999171">
4.2 Sample Two
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99300084">
For our second sample, we examined the first 52 instances
of now taken from another four randomly chosen sides of
tapes.9 This sample included tokens from fifteen speak-
ers, with exactly half produced by the host and half by
others.10 This time, six people (including the authors)
determined whether instances were cue or non-cue before
we analyzed the intonational features. We next examined
phrasing and accent used with these tokens to test the
hypotheses derived from our first sample.
Again, just over one third of our sample (20) were deter-
mined to be non-cue and just under two-thirds (32) cue.
The striking differences in phrasing noted between cue and
non-cue now in sample one were again present in sample
two: Again, around 40% (13) of cue now&apos;s formed
separate intermediate (8) or intonational (5) phrases; only
one of the 20 non-cue now&apos;s formed a separate intermedi-
ate phrase and none a separate intonational phrase. These
results were significant at the .005 level -- again strong
evidence of association between cue/non-cue status and
phrasal composition. When we tested position of now
within its intonational phrase in sample two, we again
found that cue now generally began the intonational
phrase: All but one cue now (this ended its phrase) began

information about phrasing or accent and 5 others because our
informants were unable to decide whether the now was cue or
non-cue.
10.We speak to this issue below.
its phrase; again, most (60%) non-cue now&apos;s came last in
phrase, with two first. These results were significant at
the .001 level.
Finally, our hypotheses about accent type were also borne
out by our second study: The division of all cue and non-
cue now&apos;s by accent type appears even more pronounced in
the second study: Of 20 non-cue now&apos;s, 85% of non-cue
were H* or complex and the rest deaccented; while of 31
cue now&apos;s, 58.1% were deaccented, 19.4% H* or complex,
and 22.6% L*. So, while non-cue now&apos;s are almost identi-
cal to those in the first sample, cue now&apos;s are more dis-
tinguished here from non-cue. When instances of now
forming entire intermediate or intonational phrases are
removed from the second sample, the accenting of cue and
non-cue now is even more distinct: All cue now&apos;s forming
part of a larger phrase are deaccented, while only 15.8%
of non-cue now are; the rest of the non-cue now&apos;s receive
a H* or complex accent (p &lt; .001). So, our second sam-
ple confirmed our hypotheses that cue and non-cue now
can be differentiated intonationally in terms of position
within intonational phrase, composition of intermediate or
intonational phrase, and choice of accent.

<bodyText confidence="0.999881852941176">
Although our second sample did confirm our initial
hypotheses, the preponderance of tokens in both samples
from one (professional) speaker might well be of concern.
To test this, we compared characteristics of phrasing and
accent for host and non-host data over the combined sam-
ples (n=100). The results showed no significant differ-
ences between host and caller tokens in terms of the
hypotheses proposed from our first sample and confirmed
by our second: First, host (n=37) and callers (n=63) pro-
duced cue and non-cue tokens in roughly similar propor-
tions -- 40.5% non-cue for the host and 34.9% for his call-
ers (p &gt; .5). Similarly, there was no distinction between
host and non-host data in terms of choice of accent type,
or accenting vs. deaccenting (p &gt; .1). Our hypothesis
about the significance of position within intonational
phrase holds for both host and non-host data with signifi-
cance at the .001 level in each case. However, in ten-
dency to set cue now apart as a separate intonational or
intermediate phrase, there was an interesting distinction
between host and caller: While callers tended to choose
from among the two options for cue now in almost equal
numbers (48.8% of their cue now&apos;s are separate phrases),
the host chose this option only 27.3% of the time. While
analysis of data for callers and for all speakers shows that
the relationship between cue use and separate phrase is
significant at the .001 level, this relationship is not
significant for the host data. However, although host and
caller data differ in the proportion of occurrences of the
two classes of cue now which emerge from our data as a
whole, the existence of the classes themselves are con-
firmed. Where the host did not produce cue now&apos;s set
apart as separate intonational or intermediate phrases, he
always produced cue now&apos;s which were deaccented or
accented with a L* accent. So, while individual speakers

may choose different strategies to realize cue now, they
appear to choose from among the same limited number of
options. In sum, the hypotheses proposed on the basis of
our first sample are borne out by our analysis of the
second -- and remain significant even when we eliminate
the host from our sample.

4.4 Distinguishing Cue and Non-Cue Usage in Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994464457142857">
Our conclusion from this study that intonational features
play a crucial role in the distinction between cue and non-
cue usage in speech clearly poses problems for text. Do
readers use strategies different from hearers to make this
distinction, and, if so, what might they be? Are there
perhaps orthographic correlates of the intonational features
which we have found to be important in speech? As a
first step toward resolving these questions, we examined
the orthographic features of the transcripts of our corpus
(which were prepared without particular consideration of
intonational features) and made a preliminary examination
of two sets of typescript interactions.
We examined transcriptions of all tokens of now in both
our samples to determine whether phrasing was indicated
orthographically.11 Of all those instances of now (n=60)
that were absolutely first in their intonational phrase,
56.7% (34) were preceded by punctuation -- a comma,
dash, or end punctuation. 28.3% (17) were first in
speaker turn, and thus othographically &apos;marked&apos; by indica-
tion of speaker name. It should be noted that these units
so distinguished were not necessarily syntactically well-
formed units. So, in 85% (51) of cases, first position in
intonational phrase was marked in the transcription ortho-
graphically. No now&apos;s that were not absolutely first in.
their intonational phrase (in particular, none that were
merely first in intermediate phrase) were so marked. Of
those 23 now&apos;s coming last in an intermediate or intona-
tional phrase, however, only 60.9% (14) are immediately
followed by a similar orthographic clue. Finally, of the 13
instances of now which formed separate intonational
phrases, only 2 were so marked orthographically -- by
being both preceded and followed by some punctuation.
None of the now&apos;s forming only complete intermediate
phrases were so marked.

5. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985265">
Our study of the cue phrase now strongly suggests that
speakers and hearers can distinguish between cue and
non-cue uses of cue phrases intonationally, by making or
noting differences in accent and phrasing. Cue and non-
cue now in our samples are reliably distinguished in terms
of whether now forms a separate intermediate or intona-
tional phrase, whether it occurs first in its intonational
phrase, and whether it is accented or not -- and, if
accented, the type of accent it bears. In the absence of
alternate known means of distinction between cue and
non-cue use, we propose that speakers and hearers do dif-
ferentiate intonationally. Our next step is to extend our
study to other cue phrases, including anyway, well, first,
and right. We also plan to examine the relationship
between cue usage and pitch range manipulation (7],
another indicator of discourse structure. The goal of our
research is both to provide new sources of linguistic infor-
mation for work in plan inference and discourse under-
standing, and to permit more sophisticated use of intona-
tional variation in synthetic speech.

These findings suggest that only the intonational feature
&apos;first in intonational phrase&apos; has any clear orthographic
correlate. However, since this feature does characterize
90.1% of the 63 cue now&apos;s in our spoken data (merging
both samples) -- and since 85.0% of these cue now&apos;s are
also orthographically marked for position as well (so that
80.1% of cue now&apos;s can be orthographically distinguished)
-- it seems that this correlation between intonation and
orthography may be a useful one to pursue. It is also pos-
sible that a perusal of text, rather than transcribed speech,
might indicate more orthographic clues to cue/non-cue
disambiguation. We are currently examining two sets of

Section 4 describes our data, presents the results of our analysis, and along with Section 5, discusses the implications of our results for the identification of cue phrases in general -- both in speech and in written text. 2. The Problem Previous definitions of cue phrases as a class have been extensional and definitions of particular cue phrases procedural. For example, now signals a &apos;push&apos; or &apos;pop&apos; [5] of the attentional stack or &apos;further development&apos; of a previous context [16]. Despite some recognition [5] that cue phrases are not always employed as cue phrases, no attempt has been made to discover how &apos;cue&apos; uses of cue phrases are distinguished from `non-cue&apos; uses. When does now, for example, function as a discourse marker and when is it deictic? Roughly, the non-cue or deictic use of now makes reference to a span of time which minimally includes the utterance time. This time span may include little more than moment of utterance, as in 1, or it may be of indeterminate length, as in 2.3 ev</context>

A well-formed intermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents, Figure 1. A Simple Declarative Contour All the pitch accents in this phrase, including the nuclear accent -- the primary stressed syllable -- are high (H*). The phrase accent is L and the boundary tone is also low (L%). A given sentence may be uttered with considerable variation in phrasing.

Based on a study of now in natural recorded discourse, we propose that cue and non-cue usage can be distinguished intonationally, on the basis of phrasing and accent. 1. Introduction Cue phrases are linguistic expressions -- such as okay, but, now, anyway, by the way, in any case, that reminds me -- which may, instead of making a `semantic&apos; contribution to an utterance (i.e., affecting its truth conditions), be used to convey explicit information about the structure of a discourse [4], [16], [5].l For example, anyway can indicate a topic return and that reminds me can signal a digression. The recognition and generation of cue phrases is of considerable interest to research in natural language processing. The structural information conveyed by these phrases is crucial to tasks such as anaphora resolution [6], [5], [16] and the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse [11], [8], [16].

Section 4 describes our data, presents the results of our analysis, and along with Section 5, discusses the implications of our results for the identification of cue phrases in general -- both in speech and in written text. 2. The Problem Previous definitions of cue phrases as a class have been extensional and definitions of particular cue phrases procedural. For example, now signals a &apos;push&apos; or &apos;pop&apos; [5] of the attentional stack or &apos;further development&apos; of a previous context [16]. Despite some recognition [5] that cue phrases are not always employed as cue phrases, no attempt has been made to discover how &apos;cue&apos; uses of cue phrases are distinguished from `non-cue&apos; uses. When does now, for example, function as a discourse marker and when is it deictic? Roughly, the non-cue or deictic use of now makes reference to a span of time which minimally includes the utterance time.

While a temporal adverbial may be substituted for now in 5 (e.g., Today I have a profit sharing coming to me), both cue and non-cue interpretations appear equally plausible from the transcription, as noted above. In fact, listeners have no hesitation in labeling this a cue now. A third possibility is that hearers use surface order position to distinguish cue from non-cue uses. In fact, most systems that generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usually first) position within the clause [16], (21]. However, without intonational information, surface position may itself be unclear. Consider Example 6: 6. While the distinction between cue and non-cue now seems fairly clear in the above examples, other cases are more difficult. Consider 5: 5. Ethel: All right I have just retired from a position that I&apos;ve been in for forty some odd years. I have -- I earned in 1981 about thirty thousand dollars. Now I have a profit , sharing coming to me. My problem is shall I take the ten year averaging... From the transcription alone, either a cue or a non-cue interpretation is plausible.

As a system of intonational description, we have adopted Pierrehumbert&apos;s [13] theory </context>

The recognition and generation of cue phrases is of considerable interest to research in natural language processing. The structural information conveyed by these phrases is crucial to tasks such as anaphora resolution [6], [5], [16] and the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse [11], [8], [16]. It has also been claimed that the incorporation of cue phrases into natural language processing systems helps reduce the complexity of discourse processing [21], [4], [10]. Despite the recognized importance of cue phrases, many questions about how they are defined both individually and as a class -- and how they are to be represented, generated, and recognized -- remain to be examined. For example, in the general case, each lexical item that can serve as a &apos;cue phrase&apos; also has an alternate interpretation.2 While the `cue&apos; interpretation provides explicit 1. Previous literature has employed the terms &apos;clue word&apos;, &apos;discourse marker&apos; or &apos;discourse particle&apos; for these items [16], [4], [14], [18]. More recently Grosz and Sidner [5] have proposed the term</context>
