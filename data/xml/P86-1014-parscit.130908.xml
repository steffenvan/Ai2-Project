ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999840869565217">
The documentation of (unbounded-length) copying and
cross-serial constructions in a few languages in the recent
literature is usually taken to mean that natural languages
are slightly context-sensitive. However, this ignores those
copying constructions which, while productive, cannot be
easily shown to apply to infinite sublanguages. To allow such
finite copying constructions to be taken into account in formal
modeling, it is necessary to recognize that natural languages
cannot be realistically represented by formal languages of the
usual sort. Rather, they must be modeled as families of
formal languages or as formal languages with indefinite
vocabularies. Once this is done, we see copying as a truly
pervasive and fundamental process in human language.
Furthermore, the absence of mirror-image constructions in
human languages means that it is not enough to extend
Context-free Grammars in the direction of context-sensitivity.
Instead, a class of grammars must be found which handles
(context-sensitive) copying but not (context-free) mirror
images. This suggests that human linguistic processes use
queues rather than stacks, making imperative the
development of a hierarchy of Queue Grammars as a
counterweight to the Chomsky Grammars. A simple class of
Context-free Queue Grammars is introduced and discussed.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999971263157895">
The claim that at least some human languages cannot
be described by a Context-free Grammar no matter how large
or complex has had an interesting career. In the late 1960&apos;s
it might have seemed, given the arguments of Bar-Hillel and
Shamir (1960) about respectively coordinations in English,
Postal (1964) about reduplication-cum-incorporation of object
noun stems in Mohawk, and Chomsky (1963) about English
comparative deletion, that this claim was firmly established.
Potentially serious—and at any rate embarrassing—
problems with both the formal and the linguistic aspects of
these arguments kept popping up, however (Daly, 1974;
Levelt, 1974), and the partial fixes provided by Brandt
Corstius (as reported in Levelt, 1974) for the respectively
arguments and by Langendoen (1977) for that as well as the
Mohawk argument did not deter Pullum and Gazdar (1982)
from claiming that &amp;quot;it seems reasonable to assume that the
natural languages are a proper subset of the infinite-
cardinality CFL&apos;s, until such time as they are validly shown
not to be&amp;quot;. Two new arguments, Higginbotham&apos;s (1984) one
involving such that relativization and Postal and
Langendoen&apos;s (1984) one about sluicing were dismissed on
grounds of descriptive inadequacy by Pullum (1984a), who,
however, suggested that the Langendoen and Postal (1984)
argument about the doubling relativization construction may
be correct (all these arguments deal with English).
Pullum (1984b) likewise heaped scorn on my argument
that English reshmuplicative constructions show non-CFness,
but he accepted (1984a; 1984b) Culy&apos;s (1985) argument
about noun reduplication in Bambara and Shieber&apos;s (1985)
one about Swiss German cross-serial constructions of
causative and perception verbs and their objects. Gazdar and
Pullum (1985) also cite these two, as well as an argument by
Carlson (1983) about verb phrase reduplication in Engenni.
They also refer to my discovery of the X or no X ...
construction in English, and mention that &amp;quot;Alexis Manaster-
Ramer ... in unpublished lectures finds reduplication
constructions that appear to have no length bound in Polish,
Turkish, and a number of other languages&amp;quot;. While they do
not refer to my 1983 reshmuplication argument, which they
presumably still reject, the Turkish construction they allude
to was cited in my 1983 paper and is similar to the English
reshmuplication in form as well as function (see below).
In any case, the acceptance of even one case of non-
CFness in one natural language by the only active advocates
of the CF position would seem to suffice to remove the issue
from the agenda. Any additional arguments, such as Kac (to
appear), Kac, Manaster-Ramer, and Rounds (to appear), and
Manaster-Ramer (to appear a; to appear b) may appear to be
no more than flogging of dead horses. However, as I argued
in Manaster-Ramer (1983) and as recent work (Manaster-
Ramer, to appear a; Rounds, Manaster-Ramer, and
Friedman, to appear) shows ever more clearly, this
conception of the issue (viz., Is there one natural languages
that is weakly noncontext-free?) makes very little difference
and not much sense.
First of all, if non-CFness is so hard to find, then it is
presumably linguistically marginal. Second, weak generative
arguments cannot be made to work for natural languages,
because of their high degree of structural ambiguity and the
great difficulty in excluding every conceivable interpretation
on which an apparently ungrammatical string might turn
out—on reflection—to be in the language. Third, weak
generative capacity is in any case not a very interesting
property of a formal grammar, especially from a linguistic
point of view, since linguistic models are judged by other
criteria (e.g., natural languages might well be regular without
this making CFGs any the more attractive as models for
them). Fourth, results about the place of natural languages
in the Chomsky Hierarchy seem to be should be considered in
light of the fact that there is no reason to take the Chomsky
Hierarchy as the appropriate formal space in which to look
for them. Fifth, models of natural languages that are
actually in use in theoretical, computational, and descriptive
linguistics are —and always have been—only remotely
related to the Chomsky Grammars, which means that results
about the latter may be of little relevance to linguistic models.

As I argued in 1983, we should go beyond piecemeal
debunking of invalid arguments against CFGs and by the
same token it seems to me that we must go beyond piecemeal
restatements of such arguments. Rather, we should focus on
general issues and ones that have implicati,ons for the
modeling of human languages. One such issue is, it seems to
me, the kind of context-sensitivity found in natural
languages. It appears that the counterexamples to context-
freeness are all rather similar. Specifically, they all seem to
involve some kind of cross-serial dependency, i.e., a
dependency between the nth elements of two or more
substrings. This—unlike the statement that natural
languages are noncontext-free—might mean something if we
knew what kinds of models were appropriate for cross-serial
dependencies. Given that not every kind of context-sensitive
construction is found in human languages, it should be clear
that there is nothing to be gained by invoking the dubious
slogan of context-sensitivity.
Another relevant question is the centrality or
peripherality of these constructions in natural languages.
The relevant literature makes it appear that they are
somewhat marginal at best. This would explain the tortured
history of the attempts to show that they exist at all.
However, this appears to be wrong, at least when we
consider copying constructions. The requirement of full or
near identity of two or more subparts of a sentence (or a
discourse) is a very widespread phenomenon. In this paper, I
will focus on the copying constructions precisely because they
are so common in human languages.
In addition to such questions, which appear to focus on
the linguistic side of things, there are also the more
mathematical and conceptual problems involved in the whole
enterprise of modeling human languages in formal terms.
My own belief is that both kinds of issues must be solved in
tandem, since we cannot know what kind of formal models we
want until we know what we are going to model, and we
cannot know what human languages are or are not like until
we know how to represent them and what to compare them
to. This paper is intended as a contribution to this kind of
work.
Copying Dependencies
The examples of copying (and other) constructions which
have figured in the great context-freeness debate have all
involved attempts to show that a whole (natural) language is
noncontext free. Now, while it is often easy to find a
noncontext-free subset of such a language, it is not always
possible to isolate that subset formally from the rest of the
language in such a way as to show that the language as a
whole is noncontext-free. There is so much ambiguity in
natural languages that it is strictly speaking impossible to
isolate any construction at the level of strings, thus
invalidating all arguments against CFGs or even Regular
Grammars that refer to weak generative capacity. However,
the arguments can be reconstructed by making use of the
notion of classificatory capacity of formal grammars,
introduced in Manaster-Ramer (to appear a) and Manaster-
Ramer and Rounds (to appear). The classificatory capacity is
the set of languages generated by the various subgrammars
of a grammar, and if we are willing to assume that linguists
can tell which sentences in a language exemplify the same or
different syntactic patterns, then we can usually simply
demonstrate that, e.g., no CFG can have a subgrammar
generating all and only the sentences of some particular
construction if that construction involves reduplication. This
will show the inadequacy of CFGs, even if the string set as a
whole may be strictly speaking regular. Note that this
approach holds that it is impossible to determine with any
confidence that a particular string qua string is
ungrammatical, but that it may be possible to tell one
construction from another, and that the latter—and not the
former—is the real basis of all linguistic work, theoretical,
computational, and descriptive.

Finite Copying
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938636363637">
The counterexamples to context-freeness in the
literature have all been claimed to crucially involve
expressions of unbounded length. This seemed necessary in
view of the fact that an upper bound on length would imply
finiteness of the subset of strings involved, which would as a
result be of no formal language theoretic interest. However, it
is often difficult to make a case for unbounded length, and the
main result has been that, even though every linguist knows
about reduplication, it seemed nearly impossible to find an
instance of reduplication that could be used to make a formal
argument against CFGs, even though no one would ever use
a CFG to describe reduplication.
For, in addition to reduplications that can apply to
unboundedly long expressions, there is a much better known
class of reduplications exemplified by Indonesian
pluralization of nouns. Here it is difficult to show that the
reduplicated forms are infinite in number, because compound
nouns are not pluralized in the same way, and ignoring
compounding, it would seem that the number of nouns is
finite. However, this number is very large and moreover it is
probably not well defined. The class of noun stems is open,
and can be enriched by borrowing from foreign languages and
neologisms, and all of these spontaneously pluralize by
reduplication.
Rounds, Manaster-Ramer, and Friedman (to appear)
argue that facts like this mean that a natural language
should not be modeled as a formal language but rather as a
family of languages, each of which may be taken as an
approximation to an ideal language. In the case before us,
we could argue that each of the approximations has only a
finite number of nouns, for example, but a different number
in different approximations. This idea, related to the work of
Yuri Gurevich on finite dynamic models of computation,
allows us to state the argument that the existence of an open
class of reduplications is sufficient to show the inadequacy of
CFGs for that family of approximations. The basis of the
argument is the observation that while each of the
approximate languages could in principle have a CFG, each
such CFG would differ from the next not only in the addition
of a new lexical item but also in the addition of a new
reduplication rule (for that particular item).
To capture what is really going on, we require a
grammar that is the same for each approximation modulo the
lexicon. This grammar in a sense generates the infinite ideal,
but actually each actual approximate grammar only has a
finite lexicon and hence actually only generates a finite
number of reduplications. In order to model the flexibility of
the natural language vocabulary, we assume that each
member of the family has the same grammar modulo the
terminal vocabulary and the rules which insert terminals.
Another way of stating this is that the lexicon of
Indonesian is finite but of an indefinite size (what Gurevich
calls &amp;quot;uncountably finite&amp;quot;). A CFG would still have to contain
a separate rule for the plural of every noun and hone&apos;
would have to be of an indefinite size. Thus, with
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.984501">
86
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849044444445">
addition of a new noun, the grammar would have to add a
new rule. However, this would mean that the grammar at
any given time can only form the plurals of nouns that have
already been learned. Since speakers of the language know
in advance how to pluralize unfamiliar nouns, this cannot be
true. Rather the grammar at any given time must be able to
form plurals of nouns that have not yet been learned. This in
turn means that an indefinite number of plurals can be
formed by a grammar of a determinate finite size. Hence, in
effect, the number of rules for plural formation must be
smaller than the number of plural forms that can be
generated, and this in turn means that there is no CFG of
Indonesian.
This brings up a crucial issue, of which we are all
presumably aware but which is usually lost sight of in
practice, namely, that the way a mathematical model (in this
case, formal language theory) is applied to a physical or
mental domain (in this case, natural language) is a matter of
utility and not itself subject to proof or disproof. Formal
language theory deals with sets of strings over well-defined
finite vocabularies (also often called alphabets) such as the
hackneyed {a, It has been all too easy to fall into the trap
of equating the formal language theoretic notion of
vocabulary (alphabet) with the linguistic notion of vocabulary
and likewise to confuse the formal language theoretic notion
of a string (word) over the vocabulary (alphabet) with the
linguistic notion of sentence.
However, the fundamental fact about all known natural
languages is the openness of at least some classes of words
(e.g., nouns but perhaps not prepositions or, in some
languages, verbs), which can acquire new members through
borrowing or through various processes of new formation,
many of them apparently not rule-governed, and which can
also lose members, as words are forgotten. Thus, the well-
defined finite vocabularies of formal language theory are not
a very good model of the vocabularies of natural languages.
Whether we decide to introduce the notion of families of
languages or that of uncountably finite sets or whether we
rather choose to say that the vocabulary of a natural
language is really infinite (being the set of all strings over the
sounds or letters of the language that could conceivably be or
become lexical items in it), we end up having to conclude that
any language which productively reduplicates some open
word class to form some grammatical category cannot have a
CFG.

Copying in English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995087228070175">
It should now be noted that reduplications (and
reiterations generally) are extremely common in natural
languages. Just how common follows from an inspection of
the bewildering variety of such constructions that are found
in English. All the examples cited here are productive though
they may be of bounded length.
Linguistics shminguistics.
Linguistics or no linguistics, (I am going home).
A dog is a dog is a dog.
Philosophize while the philosophizing is good!
Moral is as moral does.
Is she beautiful or is she beautiful?
These are clause-level constructions, but we also find
ones restricted to the phrase level.
(He) deliberates, deliberates, deliberates (all day long).
(He worked slowly) theorem by theorem.
(They form) a church within a church.
(He debunks) theory after theory.
Also relevant are cases where a copying dependency
extends across sentence boundaries, as in discourses like:
A: She is fat.
B: She is fat, my foot.
It is interesting that several of these types are
productive even though they appear to be based on what
originally must have been more restricted, idiomatic
expressions. The pattern a X within a X, for example, is
surely derived from the single example a state within a state,
yet has become quite productive.
Many of these patterns have analogues in other
languages. For example, the X after X construction appears
to involve quantification and this may be related to the fact
that, for example, Bambara uses reduplication to mean
&apos;whatever&apos; and Sanskrit to mean &apos;every&apos; (Panini 8.1.4).
English reshmuplication has close analogues in many
languages, including the whole Dravidian and Turkic
language families. Tamil kiduplication (e.g. pustakam
kistakam) and Turkish meduplication (e.g., kitap mitap) are
instances of this, though the semantic range is somewhat
different. In both of these, the sense is more like that of
English books and things, books and such, i.e., a combination
of deprecation and etceteraness rather than the purely
derisive function of English books shmooks. The English X or
no X ... pattern is very similar to a Polish construction
consisting of the form X (nominative) X (instrumental) ... in
its range of applications. The repetition of a verb or verbal
phrase to deprecate excessive repetition or intensity of an
action seems to be found in many languages as well.
I have not tried here to survey the uses to which copying
constructions are put in different languages or even to
document fully their wide incidence, though the examples
cited should give some indication of both. It does appear that
copying constructions are extremely common and pervasive,
and this in turn suggests that they are central to man&apos;s
linguistic faculties. When we consider such additional facts
as the frequency of copying in child language, we may be
tempted to take copying as one of the basic linguistic
operations.

Copies vs. mirror images
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916181818182">
The existence and the centrality of copying constructions
poses interesting questions that go beyond the inadequacy of
CFGs. For example, why should natural languages have
reduplications when they lack mirror-image constructions,
which are context-free? This asymmetry (first noted in
Manaster-Ramer and Kac, 1985, and Rounds, Manaster-
Ramer, and Friedman op. cit.) argues that it is not enough to
make a small concession to context-sensitivity, as the saying
goes. Rather than grudgingly clambering up the Chomsky
Hierarchy towards Context-sensitive Grammars, we should
consider going back down to Regular Grammars and striking

out in a different direction. The simplest alternative proposal
is a class of grammars which intuitively have the same
relation to queues that CFGs have to stacks. The idea, Which
I owe to Michael Kac, would be that human linguistic
processes make little if any use of stacks and employ queues
instead.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.953708">
Queue Grammars
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996557">
This suggests that CFGs are not just inadequate as
models of natural languages but inadequate in a particularly
damaging way. They are not even the right point of
departure, since they not only undergenerate but also
overgenerate. This leads to the idea of a hierarchy of
grammars whose relation to queues is like that of the
Chomsky Grammars to stacks. A queue-based analogue to
CFG is being developed, under the name of Context-free
Queue Grammar. The current version is allowed rules of
the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5749396">

the end of the string being rewritten. Otherwise, all
definitions are as in a corresponding restricted CFG. Thus,

will generate the copying language over fa,131 excluding the
null string and define derivations like the following:

<equation confidence="0.994778">

S —&gt; bSb —&gt; baSba —&gt; baaSbaa —&gt; baabSbaab
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989049382716">
On the other hand, I conjecture that the corresponding
xmi(x) language cannot be generated by such a grammar.
Even at this early stage of inquiry into these formalisms,
then, we have some tangible promise of being able to explain
why natural languages should have reduplications but not
mirror-image constructions. Various xh(x) constructions such
as the respectively ones and the cross-serial verb constructions
can be handled in the same way as reduplications.
While the idea of taking queues as opposed to stacks as
the principal nonfinite-state resource available to human
linguistic processes would explain the prevalence of copying
and the absence of mirror images, it does not explain the
coexistence of center-embedded constructions with cross-serial
ones or the relative scarcity of cross-serial constructions other
than copying ones.
For this reason, if for no other, the CFQGs could not be
an adequate model of natural language. In fact, there are
further problems with these grammars. One way in which
they fail is that they apparently can only generate two
copies—or two cross-serially dependent substrings—whereas
natural languages seem to allow more (as in Grammar is
grammar is grammar). This is similar to the limitation of
Head Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars to generating
no more than four copies (Manaster-Ramer to appear a).
However, a more general class of Queue Grammars appears
to be within reach which will generate an arbitrary number of
copies.
Perhaps more serious is the fact that CFQGs apparently
can only generate copying constructions at the cost of
profligacy (as defined in Rounds, Manast,er-Ramer, and
Friedman, to appear). The repair of this defect is less
obvious, but it appears that the fundamental idea of basing
models of natural languages on queues rather than stacks is
not undermined. Rather, what is at issue is the way in which
information is entered into and retrieved from the queue.
The CFQGs suggest a piecemeal process but the
considerations cited here seem to argue for a global one. A
number of formalisms with these properties are being
explored.
On the other hand, it may be that something much like
the simple CFQG is a natural way of capturing cross-serial
dependencies in cases other than copying. To see exactly
what is involved, consider the difference between copying and
other cross-serial dependencies. This difference has little to
do with the form of the strings. Rather, in the case of other
cross-serial dependencies, there is a syntactic and semantic
relation between the nth elements of two or more structures.
For example, in la respectively construction involving a
conjoined subject arid a conjoined predicate, each conjunct of
the former is semantically combined with the corresponding
conjunct of the latter. In the case of copying constructions,
there is nothing analogous. The corresponding parts of the
two copies do not bear any relations to each other. Thus it
makes some sense to build up the corresponding parts of
cross-serial construction in a piecemeal fashion, but this
appears to be inapplicable in the case of •copying
constructions.
In view of all these limitations, the CFQGs might seem
to be a non-starter. However, their importance lies in the
fact that they are the first step in reorienting our notions of
the formal space for models of natural language. Any real
success in the theoretical models of human language depends
on the development of appropriate mathematical concepts and
on closing the gap between formal language and natural
language theory. One of the first steps in this direction must
involve breaking the spell of CFGs and the Chomsky
Hierarchy. The CFQGs seem to be cut out for this task.
Moreover, the idea that queues rather than stacks are
involved in human language appears to be correct, and this
more general result is independent of the limitations of
CFQGs. However, given my stated goals for formal models,
it is necessary to develop models such as CFQGs before
proceeding to more complex ones precisely in order to develop
an appropriate notion of formal space within which we will
have to work.
The other main point addressed in this paper, the need
to model human languages as families of formal languages or
as formal languages with indefinite terminal vocabularies, is
intended in the same spirit. The allure of identifying formal
language theoretic concepts with linguistic ones in the
simplest possible way is hard to overcome, but it must be if

we are to get any meaningful results about natural languages
through the formal route. It will, again, be necessary to do
more work on these concepts, but it is beginning to look as
though we have found the right direction.

<abstract confidence="0.994266416666666">The documentation of (unbounded-length) copying and cross-serial constructions in a few languages in the recent literature is usually taken to mean that natural languages are slightly context-sensitive. However, this ignores those copying constructions which, while productive, cannot be easily shown to apply to infinite sublanguages. To allow such finite copying constructions to be taken into account in formal modeling, it is necessary to recognize that natural languages cannot be realistically represented by formal languages of the usual sort. Rather, they must be modeled as families of formal languages or as formal languages with indefinite vocabularies. Once this is done, we see copying as a truly pervasive and fundamental process in human language. Furthermore, the absence of mirror-image constructions in human languages means that it is not enough to extend Context-free Grammars in the direction of context-sensitivity. Instead, a class of grammars must be found which handles (context-sensitive) copying but not (context-free) mirror images. This suggests that human linguistic processes use queues rather than stacks, making imperative the development of a hierarchy of Queue Grammars as a counterweight to the Chomsky Grammars. A simple class of Context-free Queue Grammars is introduced and discussed.</abstract>

In any case, the acceptance of even one case of nonCFness in one natural language by the only active advocates of the CF position would seem to suffice to remove the issue from the agenda. Any additional arguments, such as Kac (to appear), Kac, Manaster-Ramer, and Rounds (to appear), and Manaster-Ramer (to appear a; to appear b) may appear to be no more than flogging of dead horses. However, as I argued in Manaster-Ramer (1983) and as recent work (ManasterRamer, to appear a; Rounds, Manaster-Ramer, and Friedman, to appear) shows ever more clearly, this conception of the issue (viz., Is there one natural languages that is weakly noncontext-free?) makes very little difference and not much sense. First of all, if non-CFness is so hard to find, then it is presumably linguistically marginal. Second, weak generative arguments cannot be made to work for natural languages, because of their high degree of structural ambiguity and the great difficulty in excluding every conceivable interpretation on which an apparently ungram</context>

When we consider such additional facts as the frequency of copying in child language, we may be tempted to take copying as one of the basic linguistic operations. Copies vs. mirror images The existence and the centrality of copying constructions poses interesting questions that go beyond the inadequacy of CFGs. For example, why should natural languages have reduplications when they lack mirror-image constructions, which are context-free? This asymmetry (first noted in Manaster-Ramer and Kac, 1985, and Rounds, ManasterRamer, and Friedman op. cit.) argues that it is not enough to make a small concession to context-sensitivity, as the saying goes. Rather than grudgingly clambering up the Chomsky Hierarchy towards Context-sensitive Grammars, we should consider going back down to Regular Grammars and striking 87 out in a different direction. The simplest alternative proposal is a class of grammars which intuitively have the same relation to queues that CFGs have to stacks. The idea, Which I owe to Michael Kac, would be that human linguistic processes make little if any use of stacks and em</context>
