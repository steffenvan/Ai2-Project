Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999965">
In this paper, the issue of document
structuring is addressed. To achieve this
task, we advocate that Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory (SDRT)
is a most expressive discourse frame-
work. Then we sketch a discourse plan-
ning mechanism which aims at pro-
ducing as many paraphrastic document
structures as possible from a set of fac-
tual data encoded into a logical form.

<bodyText confidence="0.977139933333333">
Using the terms of (Reiter and Dale, 2000), we
consider that the Document Planner architecture
is pipelined: first the content determination task
does its work, and then the document structuring
task takes the result and build a document plan.
Following the work of (Roussarie, 2000), we
adopt SDRT (Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides,
1998), which was designed first for text under-
standing, for the document structuring task1.
The input to the document structuring compo-
nent is a set of factual data encoded into a logical
form, as in (1).
This level of representation is supposed to be
language independent, although we use English-
like predicates for the sake of simplification. (1)

adopted SDRT for text generation. The work presented here
differs from his work in the following: content determination
and document structuring are pipelined here, while they are

lation, i.e. cause, between the events and .
A document plan is a SDRS. Our goal is to pro-
duce a wide range of paraphrases from the same
factual data. For example, from the logical for-
m in (1), we want to produce at least all the texts
in (2). These texts have different communicative
structures and so correspond to different commu-
nicative goals. However, these issues will not be
addressed here.

To produce paraphrases, we start by produc-
ing several document plans (i.e. SDRSs) from
the same factual data. The SDRS underlying (2a)
is in (3a) in which the discourse relation Re-
sult between and expresses the predicate
cause . The SDRS underlying (2b) is sim-
ilar to (3a) except that Explanation is in-
volved instead of Result . The SDRS un-
derlying (2c) is in (3b). It includes the dis-
course relation Commentary2 defined in (Asher,
1993). To ensure the cohesion of texts, we add
the following constraint to his definition: Com-
mentary requires that one element in
is coreferent with one element in , as it is the
case in (3b) with . In (3b), the causal
relation has been reified as the discourse referent
f (see section 5). This discourse referent is ex-

pressed through the verb bring into3. The SDRS
underlying (2d) is similar to (3b).
When provided as input to a “tactical compo-
nent” (microplanner and surface realizer), a given
SDRS leads to zero, one or several texts. It lead-
s to nothing when there is a lexical (or syntac-
tic) gap in the target language. For example, if
there is no verbal predicate semantically equiva-
lent to be due to in the target language, the SDRS
underlying (2d) leads to nothing. Similarly, if a
SDRS includes a discourse relation which cannot
be realized in the target language (e.g. volitional-
Result proposed in (Mann and Thompson, 1987)
cannot be linguistically realized in French (Dan-
los, 2001)), it leads to nothing4. A given SDRS
leads to several texts when there are several lexi-
calizations for at least one predicate.
Thanks to the use of SDRT, we are able to give
a formal background to the following assump-

cates such as bring into orprovoke are considered as elemen-
tary ones, although it should not be so. For example, Elixir
provokes an allergic reaction is not analyzed and so is sim-
ply represented as (allergic-reaction (Elixir)) in (Bouayad-
Agha et al., 2000). Whereas, it should get a representation
translating x’s taking Elixir causes x’s having an allergic re-
action with a causal relation between two events.

relations which are likely to be language independent.

tions generally used in bottom-up document-
structuring approaches:
“The content determination mechanism has
produced a set of messages which are re-
quired to be included in the final document
plan” (Reiter and Dale, 2000, p. 114). In for-
mal terms, it translates as follows: a SDRS
built from a logical form LF is such that
the logical form derived from is logical-
ly equivalent to LF. For example, the logi-
cal forms derived from the SDRSs in (3a) and
(3b) are equivalent to that in (1) modulo ax-
ioms which will be presented in section 4.
“The NLG system has a means of determin-
ing what discourse relation (if any) can be
used to link two particular messages or com-
ponent document plans” (Reiter and Dale,
2000, p. 114). Our formal approach is based
on reversing the SDRT conditions to estab-
lish discourse relations. As an illustration, in
SDRT for text understanding, there is the Ax-
iom in (4) for Narration. This axiom states
that if Narration holds between two SDRSs
and , then the main event (me) of
happens before the main event of .
For text generation, this axiom is reversed in
the rule in (5) which is domain and language
independent. (5) is taken from (Roussarie,
2000, p. 154).

ties of which are not states,
and if the main event of occurs before

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives a crash course in SDRT. Section 3 com-
pares our approach to document structuring to
those based on RST. Section 4 explains the ax-
ioms needed to lay down the logical equivalence
of SDRSs such that (3a) and (3b). Section 5 ex-
plains the process for building SDRSs. Section 6
sketches how to generate a text from a SDRS. Sec-

meaning of the discourse in a truth-conditional
semantics fashion. For instance, the DRS repre-
senting the sentence (7a) is given in (7b).
SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation The-
ory) was introduced in (Asher, 1993) as an ex-
tension of DRT (Discourse Representation Theo-
ry, (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) in order to account
for specific properties of discourse structure.
The original motivation for developing SDRT
can be found in Asher’s study of the reference
to abstract objects in discourse. Asher argues
that a sound discourse theory has to cope with
some anaphora whose antecedents turn out to be
text segments larger than a clause or a sentence.
Moreover, it is necessary to reveal a hierarchical
discourse structure which makes appear the sites
available for anaphora–antecedent binding. Con-
sider the example in (6) taken from (Asher, 1993,
p. 318):
(6) (1) After 38 months, America is back in s-
pace. (2) The shuttle Discovery roared off the
pad from Cape Kennedy at 10:38 this morn-
ing. (3) The craft and crew performed flaw-
lessly. (4) Later in the day the TDRS shut-
tle communication satellite was successfully
deployed. (5) This has given a much needed
boost to NASA morale.
The pronoun this (6.5) can only refer to the w-
hole trip or (possibly) to the last mentioned event
(TDRS launch). Consequently, the structure of
(6) must be such that : i) there exists a constituen-
t which semantically encompasses the whole s-
tory (6.1–4), and ii) neither (6.2) nor (6.3) cor-
respond to available constituents for the anapho-
ra resolution when computing the attachment of
(6.5) in the context. Avaibility (or openness) of
constituents is a formal property that can be ac-
counted for by the use of discourse relations.

2.2 DRSs as formal discourse units

<bodyText confidence="0.97991075">
SDRT can be viewed as a super-layer on DRT
whose expressiveness is enhanced by the use of
discourse relations. Thus the DRT structures (Dis-
course Representation Structures or DRS) are han-
dled as basic discourse units in SDRT.
Formally, a DRS is a couple of setsU,Con.
U (the universe) is the set of discourse referents.
Con is a set of conditions which describe the

<bodyText confidence="0.998116285714286">
Note that in addition to individual referents (),
U includes event referents (). DRT adopts a
Davidsonian approach (Davidson, 1967): it con-
siders that events have to be denoted by singu-
lar terms in the logical form of sentences. In the
semantic model, events are handled as world im-
manent entities, and event referents () can occur
in argumental slots of certain predicates (like f-
cause in (3b)). The statement–leave
is a predicative notational variant and stands for
“ is a leaving of”.
DRSs do not correspond to linguistic categories
but are formal units: from the SDRT point of
view, one should see them as (intensional) mean-
ing structures. This is why some discourse ab-
stract objects (such as facts, situations, proposi-
tions...) can be referred to by discourse referents
(we will say that they are reified) and semantical-
ly characterized by (sub-)DRS. (8) is an example
of a fact reading, where is the characterization
predicate (Asher, 1993, p. 145).

The set of SDRT relations includes Narration
(for temporal sequence), Background (for tempo-
ral overlap), Elaboration (for whole-part or topic-
development), Explanation and Result (for cau-
sation), Commentary (for gloss).
According to (Asher, 1993, p. 319), (9) sketch-
es the SDR-theoretic analysis of (6) where each
stands for the DRS representing the content of the
th sentence in (6).
SDRSs are built by means of non monotonic
rules that encodes discourse properties and world
knowledge. For instance, one rule states that if
a discourse constituent may be connected to a
discourse constituent in the context, then nor-
mally the relation Narration holds. Anoth-
er rule states that if may be connected to and
if the main event of , i.e. me , is known as a
cause of me , then normally the relation Expla-
nation holds.

3 Comparison with RST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970034375">
As nearly everybody in the NLG community us-
es RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory, (Mann and
Thompson, 1987)) as a discourse framework, it
is generally considered that the task of document
structuring is to produce a tree in the RST style.
Since RST is a descriptive theory without any
formal background, there exists a wide range of
interpretations and several notions of Rhetorical
Structure. For some authors, e.g. (Marcu et al.,
2000), the Rhetorical Structure is very surfacic:
it is an ordered tree isomorphic to the linearized
structure of the text and a rhetorical relation can
be viewed as a nickname for a small set of cue
phrases. For other authors, the rhetorical structure
is more abstract: it aims at representing meaning.
For example, in (RAGS Project, 1999; Bouayad-
Agha et al., 2000), the Rhetorical Structure is an
unordered tree in which terminal nodes represen-
t elementary propositions, while non terminal n-
odes represent rhetorical relations which are ab-
stract relations such as cause. This rhetorical rep-
resentation is mapped into a Document Represen-
tation which is an ordered tree reflecting the sur-
facic structure of the text.
Our approach is closer to the RAGS’one if we
consider our logical form as equivalent to their
Rhetorical Structures. However, we differ ba-
sically on the following point: their Rhetorical
Structure is a tree, while our logical form, when
graphically represented, is a (connex) graph and
not a tree. Let us justify our position by consider-
ing the discourses in (10).

b. Fred run the vacuum cleaner while Sue

<bodyText confidence="0.991262">
They can be given various meanings, however
we focus on the following:
for (10a), running the vacuum cleaner is sup-
posed to be noisy and Fred attempts to both-
er Sue by making something noisy exactly
when she is sleeping,
for (10b), running the vacuum cleaner is sup-
posed to be an awful chore and Fred attempts
to please Sue by relieving her of a chore. It
just happens that he run the vacuum cleaner
while she was sleeping.
In RST, both (10a) and (10b) are given the tree
representation in (11), in which CIRC abbreviates
CIRCUMSTANCE.

The semantic interpretation of a rhetorical tree
is given by the “nuclearity principle” (Marcu,
1996): whenever two large spans are connected
through a rhetorical relation, that rhetorical rela-
tion holds also between the most important part-
s of the constituent spans. In (11), the nucleari-
ty principle amounts to saying that there is only

one interpretation, namely that in which the nu-
cleus argument of PURPOSE is , which is the
nucleus argument of CIRCUMSTANCE. This is the
right interpretation for (10b). However, (11) can-
not represent the meaning of (10a) for which the
first (nucleus) argument of PURPOSE is the sub-
tree rooted at CIRCUMSTANCE. In conclusion, a
RST tree structure is too poor: it cannot account
for the expressiveness of texts. This can be ac-
counted for by the use of representations which
correspond graphically to (connex) graphs. The
graphical representations of (10a) and (10b) and
their equivalent in pseudo logical forms are re-
spectively shown in (12a) and (12b)5.
(12a) is a tree in which the first argument of
PURPOSE is , the sub-tree rooted at CIRCUM-
STANCE. It is the interpretation of the RST tree
in (11) without the nuclearity principle. (12b) is
a graph in which is part of two relations6. This
graph corresponds to the interpretation of the RST
tree in (11) given by the nuclearity principle. This
principle makes that is part of both the rela-
tion PURPOSE with and the relation CIRCUM-
STANCE with its satellite .
The SDRSs underlying (10a) and (10b) are
shown respectively in (13a) and (13b) (the nota-
tion stands for the DRS representing and
so on). Here we replace CIRCUMSTANCE by the
SDRT relation Background for temporal overlap7.

In (13a), the first argument of Purpose is

through Background. In (13b), is part of t-
wo discourse relations. The graphical represen-
tations of (13a) and (13b) (in which R is
represented as a tree rooted at R) have the same
topology as (12a) and (12b) respectively.
In summary, in document structuring ap-
proaches based on RST, a rhetorical structure is
always a tree, whenever understood as abstract
representation or a more surfacic one. This cannot
be maintained. First, if the rhetorical structure is
an abstract conceptual representation closed to a
logical form, its graphical representation is a con-
nex graph (and not always a tree). Second, if the
rhetorical structure is a discourse representation,
as it is the case for SDRS, its graphical represen-
tation is also a connex graph.
This criticism is not the only one against RST.
This discourse framework has already been criti-
cized in the generation community (de Smedt et
al., 1996). So we advocate the use of SDRT. This
theory presents the following advantages :
it is a formalized theory which benefits of al-
l the progress in formal semantics most of-
ten realized in the understanding perspective
around DRT or SDRT.
adopting SDRT for text generation by “re-
versing” the rules (see (4) reversed in (5)) al-
lows us to have reversible systems: the same
linguistic data can be used for both text un-
derstanding and generation.
as it will be shown in section 5, the document
structuring component à la SDRT gives hint
on referring expressions: it indicates when a
pan the Background-related constituents. See (Asher and
Lascarides, 1998) for details.

discourse referent should be expressed as an
anaphoric NP.
a SDRS (i.e. a document plan) can be given
to existing microplanners and surface real-
izers with perhaps some modifications (see
section 6). For example, a SDRS can be giv-
en as input to G-TAG (Danlos, 2000) imple-
mented in CLEF (Meunier and Reyes, 1999)
provided small fits are realized.
In conclusion, we think that SDRT is a better
discourse framework than RST (for both text gen-
eration and understanding).

4 Equivalence between logical forms

Recall that we want to compute both the SDRS in
(3a) with Result and the SDRS in (3b) with Com-
mentary from the logical form in (1). Let us show
that the logical forms derived from these SDRSs
are equivalent. In SDRT, there is an axiom for Re-
sult from which one can entail the rule in (14),
which is similar to the axiom in (4) for Narration.
Therefore, the logical form derived from (3a)
is (1) repeated in (15) without the temporal infor-
mation.

The difference between (15) and (16) consists
in considering the causal relation between the two
events either as only a predicate or as a variable
plus a predicate. However, the axioms in (17a)
and (17b) can be laid down. With these axioms,
(15) and (16) are equivalent since they are both e-
quivalent to (18), in which the causal relation gets
represented twice. In other words, we have the
following logical entailments: (15), (17a) (18),

Let us underline that the content determination
task may arbitrarily result in (15), (16) or even
(18). Therefore, the document structuring task
has to produce SDRS such as (3a) and (3b) from
one of these logical forms.
There is a an important difference between
SDRSs and logical forms. SDRSs represent dis-
courses and their variables are discourse refer-
ents. Logical forms represent meanings and their
variables are pure logical variables. To compute
a SDRS from a logical form, one has to decide
which variables from the logical form become
discourse referents, as explained in the next sec-

To get a recursive process, first, we translate the
logical form into a DRS8. In case of a purely exis-
tential formula such as those we have been deal-
ing with so far, this just amounts to putting all the
variables into the universe of the DRS and split
the formula into elementary conjoined condition-
s9. The document structuring task amounts then
in building a SDRS from a DRS. The simplest way
to do that is simply to transform:
: universe
conditions
More complex structures are obtained by split-
ting the DRS into sub-DRSs as illustrated below.

condition means that the dis-
course relation to be established between
and must have condition among its conse-
quences: no other element is in charge of express-
ing condition .
In SDRT for text understanding, the condition-
s are not ordered. However, in text generation, a
document plan indicates the order of its compo-
nents. As a consequence, when a document plan
is a SDRS, its components (labelled ) have to be
ordered. In the pseudo SDRS above, it is supposed
that precedes which precedes .
Let us examine the principles governing the s-
plitting of the conditions and the universes. For
the splitting of the conditions, the whole con-
tent of the factual database has to be verbalized.
Therefore all the conditions in the DRS have to be
expressed in the SDRS. Two cases appear:
either a condition in the DRS appears as a
condition in one of the sub-DRS; that is the
case for in the DRS labelled ;
or it is expressed through a discourse rela-
tion; that is the case for . One of
the criteria for choosing an appropriate dis-
course relation is that its consequences have
to contain the condition involved. For ex-
ample, the condition cause can be ex-
pressed through Result when and
label the sub-DRSs that contain the de-
scriptions of and respectively.
Let us now look on how to determine the uni-
verses of the sub-DRSs, i.e. the discourse refer-
ents. First, there are technical constraints, name-
ly:
the arguments of any condition in a sub-DRS
must appear in the universe of this DRS;
the universes of all the sub-DRSs have to be
disjoint. This constraint is the counterpart
of the following constraint in understanding:
“partial DRSs introduce new discourse refer-
ents” (Asher, 1993, p. 71).
These two constraints are not independent. As-
suming that the first constraint is respected, the
second one can be respected with the following
mechanism: if a variable already appears in a
preceding sub-DRS labelled , then a brand new
variable is created in the universe of the curren-
t sub-DRS labelled and the condition
is added into the conditions of . The discourse
referent will be generated as an anaphora if
is available to (see section 2.1), otherwise it
will be generated as a definite or demonstrative
NP.
Secondly, as mentioned in section 4, it has
to be decided which variables become dis-
course referents. When we have for instance
f f–cause , we can decide to apply
axiom (17b), and then remove the variable f and
every condition having f as an argument (in par-
ticular the condition f–cause ). In order for
such an operation to be valid, we have to ensure
that no information is lost. In practice, this sup-
poses that no other condition than f–cause
has f as an argument. We call this operation de-
reification. Conversely from such a formula as
cause , we can apply axiom (17a),
and then remove the condition cause . We
call this operation reification. Contrarily to de-
reification, no information can be lost. These two
operation are a mix between something which is
pure logic (that adds information) and a discourse
operation that deals with discourse referents. As
our objective is to build as much dicourse plans
as possible, reification and de-reification are sys-
tematically performed whenever possible.
The process is recursive: once all this is done
(splitting the conditions, universes determina-
tion (including reification and de-reification) and
choice of discourse relations), the process can ap-
ply recursively on each of the embedded DRSs
(this is the reason why the logical form is first
translated into a DRS).

A naive solution to implement these principles
will be first described. Next some refinements
will be proposed.
The naive solution amounts to considering all
the possible splittings of the set of conditions. If
there are conditions, the number of sub-SDRSs
ranks from to . In the hypothesis of a splitting
into sub-SDRSs, each condition may be put in
any of the sub-SDRSs or in any of the sets
of conditions to be expressed by a discourse re-
lation10. Next the universes of the sub-SDRSs are
built according to the principles described above.
This leads to availability constraints (e.g. is
available to ) to be checked later on. In the nex-
t step, the possible discourse relations are com-
puted according to their consequences. At this
step, a lot of hypotheses are ruled out. For ex-
ample, any hypothesis assuming that a condition
such as–leave is to be expressed through
a discourse relation will be ruled out. Finally, the
availability constraints have to be checked using
the same rules as in understanding.
With this naive solution, a lot of documen-
t plans will be rejected by the linguistic compo-
nent. As an illustration, each sub-SDRS has to be
verbalized as a clause (see section 6). Therefore,
any sub-SDRS that does not include an eventuality
or a fact will be rejected by the linguistic compo-
nent.
This naive solution is theoretically valid, how-
ever it is not usable in practice. A lot of possible
failures can be foreseen. For example, the con-
ditions that can be expressed through a discourse
relation, e.g. cause , should be considered
first. If it is decided that such a condition is in-
deed expressed by a discourse relation, e.g. Re-
sult , then the sub-SDRSs and are
created with the conditions concerning and
respectively.
To sum up, the process of splitting the condi-
tions should not be blind. The content of the con-
ditions has to be taken into account in order to
guide the splitting and avoid thereby failures that
can be foreseen. However, the details of this opti-
mization will not be presented here.
10In SDRT, any element in the universe of a SDRS must
be linked to another element. Therefore, a SDRS with sub-
SDRSs must include (at least) discourse relations.

6 Generating a text from a SDRS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997281">
A SDRS, i.e. a document plan, is given to a micro-
planner and surface realizer which computes one
or several texts. It is the topic of another paper to
explain in detail this process. Here we will only
give the basic principles which guide the choices
to be made in the tactical component.
The process to generate a text from a SDRS
U,Con is basically recursive:
an element in U has to be generated as
a clause if labels a DRS and recursively
as a text (possibly a complex sentence) if
labels a SDRS.
a condition R in Con has to be gener-
ated as a text “ ” or as a complex
sentence “ ”, where generates

ing R ( may be empty).
a condition in Con where is a DRS
U,Conhas to generated as a clause accord-
ing to the following constraints:
– in analysis, a discourse referent is the
trace of either a determiner or an in-
flexion mark. Therefore, in generation,
a discourse referent has to be generat-
ed as an NP or a tensed verb (noted
V). Such an information is noted as e.g.
:NP/V;
– the conditions guide the lexical choic-
es. The conditions Fred corre-
spond to proper names which is noted
as:PN[Fred]. The equality conditions
between discourse referents (e.g.
) give rise to (pronominal or nominal)
anaphora which is noted as:ANA[].
The other conditions are associated to
lexical predicates.
With these constraints, an element which is
reified, e.g. f–cause , gives rise to an
NP or a verb (a cause of, provoke) and an ele-
ment which is not reified, e.g. cause ,
gives rise to a modifier on or with
and generated either as verbs or NPs.
This process results in a list such as:
– :NP/V[ –leave()],
–:PN[Fred()],
– f:NP/V[f–cause( ,)],
– :NP/V[ –fit-of-tears()],
–:PN[Mary()].
Such a list guides the lexical choices
and syntactic realization performed by the
micro-planner.

Let us show how to compute the SDRSs in (3a)
and (3b) from the logical form in (1). First, this
formula is translated in the DRS in (19), in which
the conditions are numbered for the sake of con-
venience.
From (19), one possibility is to express cond
through Result in which and label
the sub-DRSs grouping the conditions on and
respectively. Therefore, has to group cond
and cond. As cond introduces the variable,
cond has to figure also in 11. The universe
of the DRS labelled by is . Similar-
ly for, its universe is , its conditions
are cond, cond and cond. All the conditions
of (19) are therefore expressed in (3a) which is a
well-formed document plan. Following the rules
sketched in section 6, (3a) will be generated in
(2a) by the linguistic component, if Result is lex-
icalized as the cue phrase therefore which links
two sentences.
From (19), another possibility is to split all the
conditions into two sub-DRSs: the first one la-
belled grouping the conditions on (as in the
previous possibility), the second one labelled
grouping all the other conditions. cond in has
as argument. This variable already appears in
. Therefore a brand new variable is created
in the universe of and the condition

is added in. As all the conditions are split into
the sub-DRSs, and have to be linked with a
discourse relation which adds no information (i.e.
which has no consequence). Commentary is such
a discourse relation, and it is valid here since its
constraint (one element in has to be coreferent
with one element in , see section 1) is respect-
ed with the coreference relation . At this
step, the SDRS in (20) has been built.
From (20), one possibility is to transmit this
SDRS as it is to the tactical component. If Com-
mentary is lexicalized as an empty cue phrase
linking two sentences, (20) will be generated in
(21) where cause , which is not reified, is
expressed through the modifier because of.

document plans as possible.
We suppose that the content determination
component provides a logical form encoding the
factual data to be linguistically verbalized. Ax-
ioms may apply on this logical form which en-
able reifications and de-reifications. As a conse-
quence, some predicates may be realized either as
a verb, an NP or a modifier.
The document structuring component is based
on SDRT, a formalized discourse framework
which can account for the expressiveness of texts,
contrarily to RST. A document plan is a SDRS.
This level of representation is likely to be lan-
guage and domain independent and can be pro-
vided to existing surface realizers. Building
SDRSs from a logical form is a recursive process
for which a basic strategy has been presented and
exemplified.
No implementation has been realized yet, how-
ever we foresee to do it and to interface it with the
tactical component CLEF (Meunier and Reyes,
1999).

For instance, the DRS representing the sentence (7a) is given in (7b). SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) was introduced in (Asher, 1993) as an extension of DRT (Discourse Representation Theory, (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) in order to account for specific properties of discourse structure. The original motivation for developing SDRT can be found in Asher’s study of the reference to abstract objects in discourse. Asher argues that a sound discourse theory has to cope with some anaphora whose antecedents turn out to be text segments larger than a clause or a sentence. Moreover, it is necessary to reveal a hierarchical discourse structure which makes appear the sites available for anaphora–antecedent binding. Consider the example in (</context>

DRSs do not correspond to linguistic categories but are formal units: from the SDRT point of view, one should see them as (intensional) meaning structures. This is why some discourse abstract objects (such as facts, situations, propositions...) can be referred to by discourse referents (we will say that they are reified) and semantically characterized by (sub-)DRS.

Let us now look on how to determine the universes of the sub-DRSs, i.e. the discourse referents. First, there are technical constraints, namely: the arguments of any condition in a sub-DRS must appear in the universe of this DRS; the universes of all the sub-DRSs have to be disjoint. This constraint is the counterpart of the following constraint in understanding: “partial DRSs introduce new discourse referents” (Asher, 1993, p. 71). These two constraints are not independent. Assuming that the first constraint is respected, the second one can be respected with the following mechanism: if a variable already appears in a preceding sub-DRS labelled , then a brand new variable is created in the universe of the current sub-DRS labelled and the condition is added into the conditions of .

Thus the DRT structures (Discourse Representation Structures or DRS) are handled as basic discourse units in SDRT. Formally, a DRS is a couple of setsU,Con. U (the universe) is the set of discourse referents. Con is a set of conditions which describe the (7) a. Fred left. b.

DRT adopts a Davidsonian approach (Davidson, 1967): it considers that events have to be denoted by singular terms in the logical form of sentences. In the semantic model, events are handled as world immanent entities, and event referents () can occur in argumental slots of certain predicates (like fcause in (3b)). The statement–leave is a predicative notational variant and stands for “ is a leaving of”. DRSs do not correspond to linguistic categories but are formal units: from the SDRT point of view, one should see them as (intensional) meaning structures.

For instance, the DRS representing the sentence (7a) is given in (7b). SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) was introduced in (Asher, 1993) as an extension of DRT (Discourse Representation Theory, (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) in order to account for specific properties of discourse structure. The original motivation for developing SDRT can be found in Asher’s study of the reference to abstract objects in discourse. Asher argues that a sound discourse theory has to cope with some anaphora whose antecedents turn out to be text segments larger than a clause or a sentence. Moreover, it is necessary to reveal a hierarchical discourse structure which makes appear the sites available for anaphora–antecedent binding. Consider the example in (6) taken from (Asher, 1993, p. 318): (6) (1) After 38 months, America is back in</context>
