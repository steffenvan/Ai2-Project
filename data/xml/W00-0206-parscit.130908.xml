Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999569375">
In this -paper, we present the Interlingua
system ES to •generate the pronominal
anaphora into the Spanish and English
languages. We also describe the main
problems in the pronoun generation into
both languages such as zero-subject
constructions and number, gender and
syntactic differences. Our system improves
other proposals presented so far due to the
fact that we are able to solve and generate
intersentential anaphora, to detect
coreference chains and to generate Spanish
zero-pronouns into English, issues that are
hardly considered by other systems. Finally,
we provide outstanding results of our system
on unrestricted corpora.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906588235294">
One of the main problems of many commercial
Machine Translation (MT) and experimental
systems is that they do not carry out a correct
pronominal anaphora generation. Solving the
anaphora and extracting the antecedent are key
issues in a correct generation into the target
language. Unfortunately, the majority of MT
systems do not deal with anaphora resolution
and their successful operation usually does not
go beyond the sentence level. In this paper, we
present a complete approach that allows pronoun
resolution and generation into the target
language.
Our approach works on unrestricted texts
unlike other systems, like the KANT interlingua
system (Leavitt et al. (1994)), that are designed
for well-defined domains. Although full parsing
of these texts could be applied, we have used
partial parsing of the texts due to the
unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar.
This is a main difference with the majority of the
interlingua systems such as the DLT system
based on a modification of Esperanto (Witkam
(1983)), the Rosetta system which is
experimenting with Montague semantics as the
basis for an interlingua (Appelo and
Landsbergen (1986)), the KANT system, etc. as
they use full parsing of the text.
After the parsing and solving pronominal
anaphora, an interlingua representation of the
whole text is obtained. In the interlingua
representation no semantic information is used
as input, unlike some approaches that have as
input semantic information of the constituents
(Miyoshi et al. (1997), Castellon et al. (1998),
the DLT system, etc).
From this interlingua representation, the
generation of anaphora (including intersentential
anaphora), the detection of coreference chains of
the whole text and the generation of Spanish
zero-pronouns into English have been carried
out, issues that are hardly considered by other
systems. Furthermore, this approach can be used
for other different applications, e.g. Information
Retrieval, Summarization, etc.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 1,
the complete approach that includes Analysis,
Interlingua and Generation modules will be
described. These modules will be explained in
detail in the next three sections. In section 5, the
Generation module has been evaluated in order

to measure the efficiency of our proposal. To do
so, two experiments have been accomplished:
the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into
English (syntactic generation module) and the
generation of English pronouns into Spanish
ones (morphological generation module).
Finally, the conclusions of this work will be
presented.

The complete approach that solves and generates
the anaphor is based on the scheme of Figure 1.
Translation is carried out in two stages: from the
source language to the Interlingua, and from the
Interlingua into the target language. Modules far
analysis are independent from modules for
generation. In this paper, although we have only
studied the Spanish and English languages, our
approach is easily extended to other languages,
i.e. multilingual system, in the sense that any
analysis module can be linked to any generation
module.

2 Analysis module
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999551693877551">
The analysis is carried out by means of SUPAR
(Slot Unification Parser for Anaphora
resolution) system, presented in Ferrandez et al.
(2000). SUPAR is a computational system
focused on anaphora resolution. It can deal with
several kinds of anaphora, such as pronominal
anaphora, one-anaphora, surface-count anaphora
and definite descriptions. In this paper, we focus
on pronominal anaphora resolution and
generation into the target language. In
pronominal anaphora resolution in both the
Spanish and English languages, the system has
achieved an accuracy of 84% and 87%
respectively.
A grammar defined by means of the
grammatical formalism SUG (Slot Unification
Grammar) is used as input of SUPAR. A
translator that transforms SUG rules into Prolog
clauses has been developed. This translator will
provide a Prolog program that will parse each
sentence. SUPAR allows to carry out either a full
or a partial parsing of the text, with the same
parser and grammar. Here, partial parsing
techniques have been used due to the
unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar and
the use of unrestricted texts (corpora) as inputs.
These unrestricted corpora used as input for
the partial parser contain the words tagged with
their grammatical categories obtained from the
output of a part-of-speech (POS) tagger. The
word, as it appears in the corpus, its lemma and
its POS tag (with morphological information) is
supplied for each word in the corpus. The corpus
is split into sentences before applying the
parsing.
The output of the parsing module will be
the Slot Structure (SS) that stores the necessary
information2 for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) problem resolution. This SS will be the
input for the following module in which NLP
problems (anaphora, extraposition, ellipsis, etc.)
will be treated and solved.
In Ferrandez et at (1998), a partial parsing3
strategy that provides all the necessary
information for resolving anaphora is presented.
This partial parsing shows that only the
following constituents are necessary for
anaphora resolution: co-ordinated prepositional
and noun phrases, pronouns, conjunctions and
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.916308444444444">
2 The SS stores for each constituent the following
information: constituent name (NP, PP, etc.),
semantic and morphologic information, discourse
marker (identifier of the entity or discourse object)
and the SS of its subconstituents.
3 It is important to emphasize that the system allows
to carry out a full parsing of the text. In this paper,
partial parsing with no semantic information is used
in the evaluation of our approach.

verbs, regardless of the order in which they
appear in the text. The free words consist of
constituents that are not covered by this partial
parsing (e.g. adverbs).
After applying the anaphora resolution
module, a new Slot Structure (SS) is obtained.
In this new structure the correct antecedent
(chosen from the possible candidates) for each
anaphoric expression will be stored together
with its morphological and semantic
information. SS&apos; will be the input for the
Interlingua system.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.992166" genericHeader="method">
3 Interlingua system (ISS)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989040483870968">
As said before, the Interlingua system takes the
SS of the sentence after applying the anaphora
resolution module as input. This system, named
Interlingua Slot Structure (154 generates an
interlingua representation from the SS of the
sentence.
SUPAR generates one SS for each sentence
from the whole text and it solves intrasentential
and intersentential anaphora. Then, ISS
generates the interlingua representation of the
whole text. This is one of the main advantages
of ISS because it is possible to generate
intersentential pronominal anaphora.
To begin with, 155 splits sentences into
clauses4. To identify a new clause when partial
parsing has been carried out, the following
heuristic has been applied:
H1 Let us assume that the beginning of a new
clause has been found when a verb is parsed
and a free conjunction is subsequently parsed.
In this particular case, a free conjunction
does not imply conjunctions that join co-
ordinated noun and prepositional phrases. It
refers, here, to conjunctions that are parsed in
our partial parsing scheme.
Once the text has been split into clauses,
the next stage is to generate the interlingua
representation for clauses. We have used a
complex feature structure for each clause. In
Figure 2 the information of the first clause of the
example (1) is presented:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.969598">
(1) The boys of the mountains were in the
garden. They were catching flowers.
4 A clause could be defined as &amp;quot;a group of words
containing a verb&amp;quot;.

<bodyText confidence="0.996829">
As can be observed in Figure 25, the
interlingua is a frame composed of semantic
roles and features extracted from the SS of the
clause. Semantic roles that have been used in
this approach are the following: ACTION,
AGENT, THEME and MODIFIER that
correspond to verb, subject, object and
prepositional phrases of the clause respectively.
The notation we have used is based on the
representation used in KANT interlingua. To
identify these semantic roles when partial
parsing has been carried out and no semantic
knowledge is used, the following heuristic has
been applied:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.7968186">
H2 Let us assume that the NP parsed before
the verb is the agent of the clause. In the same
way, the NP parsed after the verb is the theme
of the clause. Finally, all the PP found in the
clause are its modifiers.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.860402">
5 Only the relevant attributes of each semantic role
appear in a simplified way in the picture. Additional
attributes are added to the semantic roles in order to
complete all the necessary information for the
interlingua representation.

In Figure 2 the following elements have
been found: ACTION-- &apos;were&apos;, AGENT= &apos;the
boys of the mountains&apos;, THEME= 4) (it has not
been found any NP after the verb) and
MODIFIER= &apos;in the garden&apos;. These elements
are represented by a simple feature structure.
Features are represented as attributes with their
corresponding values.
The semantic role ACTION has the
following attributes: Verb with the value of the
lemma of the verb; Number, Person and Tense
(grammatical features) and Type with the type of
the verb: impersonal, transitive, etc.
&apos; The semantic role AGENT has the
following attributes: Cat that contains the
syntactic category of the constituent; Identifier
with the value of the discourse marker; Head
that contains the lemma of the constituent&apos;s
head; Number, Gender and Person contain
grammatical features of the constituent;
MODIFIER that contains all the information
about the modifiers (PP) of the NP, and Sern_Ref
that contains semantic information about the
constituent&apos;s head if this information is
available. The semantic role THEME has the
same attributes as the semantic role AGENT, i.e.
the difference is that THEME is the object of the
clause and AGENT is the subject.
Finally, the semantic role MODIFIER has
the following attributes: Cat that contains the
syntactic category of the constituent; Identifier
with the value of the discourse marker; Prep
with the preposition of the constituent and
ENTITY, which is the object of the PP and
contains the same attributes as the THEME.
One clause can have more than one MODIFIER
depending on the number of PP that it has. It is
important to emphasize that all this information
is extracted from the SS of the constituents
parsed in the clause.
As said before, instead of representing the
clauses independently, we are interested in the
interlingua representation of the whole input
text. With the global representation of the input
text we will be able to generate intrasentential
and intersentential anaphora. Furthermore, it will
be possible to solve and generate coreference
chains. Thereby, the scheme of Figure 2 is
extended in order to represent all the discourse
using the clauses as main units of this
representation. In Figure 3 the interlingua
representation of the whole text of the example
(1) can be observed.

4 Generation module
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929818181818">
The Generation module takes the interlingua
representation of the text as input and generates
it into the target language. In this paper, we are
only describing the generation of pronouns. The
generation phase is split into two modules:
syntactic generation and morphological
generation. In the next two subsections they will
be studied in detail. Although the approach
presented here is multilingual, we have focused
on the generation into the Spanish and English
languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996152">
4.1 Syntactic generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950842105263">
In syntactic generation the interlingua
representation is converted by &apos;transformational
rules&apos; into an ordered surface-structure tree, with
appropriate labeling of the leaves with target
language grammatical functions and features.
The basic task of syntactic generation is to order
constituents in the correct sequence for the target
language. However, the aim of this work is only
the generation of pronominal anaphora into the
target language, so we have only focused on the
differences between the Spanish and English
languages in the generation of the pronoun.
These differences are what we have named
discrepancies (a study of Spanish-English
Spanish discrepancies is showed in Feral et al.
(1999)). In syntactic generation the following
discrepancies can be found: syntactic
discrepancies and Spanish ell iptical zero-subject
constructions.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.998954">
4.1.1 Syntactic discrepancies
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996940909090909">
This discrepancy is due to the fact that the
surface structures of the Spanish sentences are
more flexible than the English ones. The
constituents of the Spanish sentences can appear
without a specific order in the sentence. In order
to carry out a correct generation into English, we
must firstly reorganize the Spanish sentence.
Nevertheless, in the English-Spanish translation,
in general, this reorganization is not necessary.
Let us see an example with the Spanish
sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.645536">
(2) A Pedro lo vi ayer.
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.845065">
(I saw Peter yesterday.)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9875486">
In (2), the object of the verb, A Pedro (to
Peter), appears before the verb (in the position
of the theoretically subject) and the subject is
omitted (this phenomena is usual in Spanish and
it will be explained in the next subsection). The
PP A Pedro (to Peter) functions as an indirect
object of the verb (because it has the preposition
A (to)). We can find out the subject since the
verb is in first person and singular, so the subject
would be the pronoun Yo (I). Moreover, there is
a pronoun, lo (him) that functions as
complement of the verb vi (saw). This pronoun
in Spanish refers to the object of the verb, Peter,
when it is moved from its theoretical place after
the verb (as it occurs in this sentence).
As explained before, it is possible to
identify the semantic roles (AGENT. ACTION,
etc.) of the previous constituents in the
CLAUSE applying a series of heuristics. Once
the semantic roles of the constituents have been
established, they will be stored in the interlingua
representation. The generation into English will
be a new clause in which the order of the
constituents is the usual in English: AGENT,
ACTION, THEME and MODIFIERS.

4.1.2 Elliptical zero-subject constructions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<equation confidence="0.330929">
(zero-pronouns)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995245660377358">
As commented before, the Spanish language
allows to omit the pronominal subject of the
sentences. These omitted pronouns are usually
named zero-pronouns. While in other languages,
zero-pronouns may appear in either the subject&apos;s
or the object&apos;s grammatical position, (e.g.
Japanese), in Spanish texts, zero-pronouns only
appear in the position of the subject. In English
texts, this sort of pronoun occurs far less
frequently, as the use of them are generally
compulsory in the language. Nevertheless, some
examples can be found: &amp;quot;Ross carefully folded
his trousers and Ø .climbed into bed-. (The
symbol 0 shows the position of the omitted
pronoun). Target languages with typical
elliptical (zero) constructions corresponding to
source English pronouns are Italian, Thai,
Chinese or Japanese.
In order to generate Spanish zero-pronouns
into English, they must first be located in the
text (ellipsis detection), and then resolved
(anaphora resolution). At the ellipsis detection
stage, information about the zero-pronoun (e.g.
person, gender, and number) must first be
obtained from the verb of the clause and then
used to identify the antecedent of the zero-
pronoun (resolution stage). The detection
process depends on the knowledge about the
structure of the language itself, which gives us
clues to the use of each type of zero-pronoun.
The resolution of zero-pronouns has been
implemented in SUPAR. As we may work on
unrestricted texts to which partial parsing is
applied, zero-pronouns must also be detected
when we do not dispose of full syntactic
information. Once the input text has been split
into clauses after applying the heuristic Hi, the
next problem consists of the detection of the
omission of the subject from each clause.
If partial parsing techniques have been
applied, we can establish the following heuristic
to detect the omission of the subject from each
clause:
113 After the sentence has been divided into
clauses, a noun phrase or a pronoun is sought,
for each clause, through the clause constituents
on the left-hand side of the verb, unless it is
imperative or impersonal, Such a noun phrase
or pronoun must agree in person and number
with the verb of the clause.
Sometimes, gender information of the
pronoun can be obtained when the verb is
copulative. For example, in:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.56724875">
(3) Pedroj vio a Anak en el parque. Ok Estaba
muy guapa.
(Peterj saw Annk in the park. She, was very
beautiful.)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999706029411765">
In this example, the verb estaba (was) is
copulative, so that its subject must agree in
gender and number with its object whenever the
object can have either a masculine or a feminine
linguistic form (guapo: masc, guapa: fern). We
can therefore get information about its gender
from the object, guapa (&amp;quot;beautifid&amp;quot; in its
feminine form) which automatically assigns it to
the feminine gender so the omitted pronoun
would have to be she rather than he.
After the zero-pronoun has been detected,
SUPAR inserts the pronoun (with its information
of person, gender and number) in the position in
which it has been omitted. This pronoun will be
detected and resolved in the following module of
anaphora resolution. After that, /SS generates the
interlingua representation of the text.
In the example (3), two CLAUSES are
identified. In the second CLAUSE the zero-
pronoun is detected (third person, singular and
feminine -she-) and solved (third person,
singular and feminine -Ann-). So the AGENT of
this CLAUSE is the PRONOUN she and it has a
link to the ENTITY Ann (the chosen
antecedent).
Now, the generation of Spanish zero-
pronouns into English is easy because all the
information that it is needed is located in the
interlingua representation. The English
pronoun&apos;s information is extracted in the
following way: number and person information
are obtained from the PRONOUN and gender
information is obtained from the Head of its
antecedent.

In the morphological generation we mainly have
to treat and solve number and gender
discrepancies in the generation of pronouns.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.979079">
4.2..1 Number discrepancies
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749857142857">
This problem is generated by the discrepancy
between words of different languages that
express the same concept. These words can be
referred to a singular pronoun in the source
language and to a plural pronoun in the target
language. For example, in English the concept
people is plural, whereas in Spanish is singular.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999740055555556">
In (4), it can be observed that the name
people in English has been replaced with the
plural pronoun they, whereas in Spanish (5) the
name gente has been replaced with the singular
pronoun esta (it). Gender discrepancies also
exist in the translation of other languages such
as in the German-English translation,
In order to take into account number
discrepancies in the generation of the pronoun
into the target language a set of morphological
(number) rules is constructed.
In the generation of the pronoun They into
Spanish in the example (4), the interlingua
representation has a PRONOUN (`they&apos;, third
person and plural) that it is linked to the
ENTITY (4police&apos;, plural). For, the correct
generation into Spanish the following
morphological rule is constructed:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.413421333333333">
pronoun + third_person + plural + antecedent
(police&apos;) esta (pronoun, third person,
feminine and singular)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994885">
The left-hand side of the morphological
rule contains the interlingua representation of
the pronoun and the right-hand side contains the
pronoun in the target language.
In the same way, a set of morphological
rules is constructed in order to generate English
pronouns. Next, an example of these rules is
shown:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.536727333333333">

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947888">
English has less morphological information than
Spanish. With reference to plural personal
pronouns, the pronoun we can be translated into
nosotros (masculine) or nosotras (feminine), you
into ustecies (masculine/feminine), vosotros
(masculine) or vosotras (feminine) and they into
el/os or el/as. Furthermore, the singular personal
pronoun it can be translated into el/este
(masculine) or ella/esta (feminine). For
example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9174825">
(6) Women, were in the shop. Theyi were buying
gifts for their husbands.
(7) Las mujeres, estaban en la tienda. Ellas,
estaban comprando legatos para sus maridos.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496558823529">
In Spanish, the plural name mujeres
(women) is feminine and is replaced by the
personal pronoun el/as (plural feminine) (7),
whereas in English they is valid for masculine as
well as for feminine (6).
These discrepancies do not always mean
that Spanish anaphors bear more information
than English one. For example, Spanish
possessive adjectives (at easa) do not carry
gender information whereas English possessive
adjectives do (his/her house).
We can find similar discrepancies among
other languages. For example, in the
French-German translation, gender is assigned
arbitrarily in both languages (although in French
is not as arbitrarily as in German). The English-
German translation, like English-Spanish,
supposes a translation from a language with
neutral gender into a language that assigns
gender grammatically.
As commented, it is important to
emphasize that the omission of the pronominal
subject is very usual in Spanish. If we want to
stress the subject of a clause or distinguish
between different possible subjects, we will have
to write the pronominal subject. Otherwise,
pronominal subject could be omitted. We are
interested, however, in the correct generation of
pronouns, and therefore, they will never be
omitted.
Thanks to the fact that our system solves
only personal pronouns in third person, we have
only studied gender discrepancies in the
generation of the third person pronouns. The

study has been divided into pronouns with
subject role and pronouns with complement role.
a) Pronouns with subject role. This kind of
pronouns can be identified in the interlingua
representation because they have the semantic
role of AGENT in a CLAUSE. Their
antecedents are established with the links to the
ENTITIES.
The main problem in the pronoun
generation into English consists of the
generation of pronoun it. If we have a pronoun
with the following attributes: masculine,
singular and third person in the interlingua
representation, this can be generated into the
Spanish prorieuns he. or it. If the antecedent of
the pronoun refers to a person, we will generate
it into he. If the antecedent of the pronoun is an
animal or a thing we will generate it into it.
These characteristics of the antecedent can be
obtained from the semantic information stored in
its attribute Sem Ref. A similar strategy is used
to generate the pronouns she or it. With
reference to plural personal pronouns:
masculine/feminine, plural and third person,
they are generated into the English pronoun
they.
In Figure 4, the set of morphological rules
to treat gender discrepancies in English
generation of pronouns is shown:

The syntactic generation and morphological
generation modules of our approach have been
evaluated. To do so, one experiment for each
module has been accomplished. In the first one,
the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into
English, using the techniques described above in
subsection 4.1.2, has been evaluated6. In the
second one, the generation of English
pronouns into Spanish ones has been evaluated.
In this experiment number and gender
discrepancies and their resolution, described
above in section 4.2, have been taken into
account.
With reference to the first experiment, our

handmade corpus7 that contains 106 zero-
pronouns. With this training, we have extracted
the degree of importance of the preferences that
are used in the anaphora resolution module of
the system. Furthermore, we have been able to
check and correct the techniques used in the
detection and generation of zero-pronouns into
English. After that, we have carried out a blind
evaluation on unrestricted texts using the set of
preferences and the generation techniques
learned during the training phase. In this case,
partial parsing of the text with no semantic
information has been used.
With regard to unrestricted texts, our
system has been run on two different Spanish
corpora: a) a fragment of the Spanish version of
The Blue Book corpus (15,571 words), which
contains the handbook of the International
Telecommunications Union CCITT, and b) a
fragment of the Lexesp corpus (9,746 words),
which contains ten Spanish texts from different
genres and authors. These texts are taken mainly
from newspapers. These corpora have been
POS-tagged. Having worked with different
genres and disparate authors, we feel that the
applicability of our proposal to other sorts of
texts is assured.
To evaluate the generation of Spanish zero-
pronouns into English three tasks have been
accomplished: a) the evaluation of the detection
of zero-pronouns, b) the evaluation of anaphora
resolution and c) the evaluation of generation.
a) Evaluating the detection of zero-pronouns.
To do this, verbs have been classified into
two categories: 1) verbs whose subjects
have been omitted, and 2) verbs whose
subjects have not. We have obtained a
success rateg of 88% on 1,599 classified
verbs, with no significant differences seen
between the corpora. We should also
remark that a success rate of 98% has been
obtained in the detection of verbs whose
subjects were omitted, whereas only 80%
was achieved for verbs whose subjects
were not. This lower success rate is

justified for several reasons. One important
reason is the non-detection of impersonal
verbs by the POS tagger. Two other
reasons are, the lack of semantic
information and the inaccuracy of the
grammar used. It is important to note that
46% of the verbs in these corpora have
their subjects omitted. It shows quite
clearly the importance of this phenomenon
in Spanish.
b) Evaluating anaphora resolution. In this
task, the evaluation of zero-pronoun
resolution is accomplished. Of the 1,599
verbs classified in these two corpora, 734
of them have zero-pronouns. Only 228 of
them9, however, are in third person and will
be anaphorically resolved. A success rate of
75% was attained for the 228 zero-
pronouns. By &amp;quot;successful resolutions&amp;quot; we
mean that the solutions offered by our
system agree with the solutions offered by
two human experts.
c) Evaluating zero-pronoun generation. The
generation of the 228 Spanish zero-
pronouns into English has been evaluated.
The following results in the generation
have been obtained: a success rate of 70%
in Lexesp and a success rate of 89% in The
Blue Book. In general (both corpora) a
success rate of 75% has been achieved. The
errors are mainly produced by fails in
anaphora resolution and fails in the
generation of pronouns he/she/it (some
heuristicsio, which have failed sometimes,
have been applied due to the used corpora
do not include semantic information).
In the second experiment, we have
evaluated the generation of Spanish personal
pronouns with subject role into the English ones.
A fragment of the English version of The Blue
Book corpus (70,319 words) containing 165

they are cataphoric (the antecedent appears after the
anaphor) or exophoric (the antecedent does not
appear, linguistically, in the text).
10 For instance: &amp;quot;all the pronouns in third person and
singular whose antecedents are proper nouns have
been translated into he (antecedent with masculine
gender) or she (antecedent with feminine gender);
otherwise they have been translated into it&amp;quot;.

pronouns with subject role has been used in
order to carry out a blind evaluation. A success
rate of 85.41% has been achieved. The errors are
mainly produced by fails in anaphora resolution
and in the correct choice of the gender of the
antecedent&apos;s Head in Spanish. With reference to
the choice of the gender of the antecedent&apos;s
Head, an electronic dictionary has been used in
order to translate the original English word into
the Spanish one, and subsequently, the gender is
extracted from the Spanish word. Several
problems have occurred when using this
electronic dictionary:
1) the word to be translated does not appear in
the dictionary, and, therefore, a heuristic is
applied to assign the gender
2) the correct sense of the English word is not
chosen, and therefore, the gender could be
assigned incorrectly.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953263157895">
In this paper a complete approach to solve and
generate pronominal anaphora in the Spanish
and English languages is presented. The
approach works on unrestricted texts to which
partial parsing techniques have been applied.
After the parsing and solving pronominal
anaphora, an interlingua representation (based
on semantic roles and features) of the whole text
is obtained. The representation of the whole text
is one of the main advantages of our system due
to several problems, that are hardly solved by
the majority of MT systems, can be treated and
solved. These problems are the generation of
intersentential anaphora, the detection of
coreference chains and the generation of Spanish
zero-pronouns into English. Generation of zero&apos;.
pronouns and Spanish personal pronouns has
been evaluated obtaining a success rate of 75%
and 85.41% respectively.
