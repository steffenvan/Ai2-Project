We present a study of aspects of discourse
structure — specifically discourse devices
used to organize information in a sen-
tence — that significantly impact the qual-
ity of machine translation. Our analysis
is based on manual evaluations of trans-
lations of news from Chinese and Ara-
bic to English. We find that there is a
particularly strong mismatch in the no-
tion of what constitutes a sentence in Chi-
nese and English, which occurs often and
is associated with significant degradation
in translation quality. Also related to
lower translation quality is the need to em-
ploy multiple explicit discourse connec-
tives (because, but, etc.), as well as the
presence of ambiguous discourse connec-
tives in the English translation. Further-
more, the mismatches between discourse
expressions across languages significantly
impact translation quality.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939325">
In this study we examine how the use of dis-
course devices to organize information in a sen-
tence — and the mismatch in their usage across
languages — influence machine translation (MT)
quality. The goal is to identify discourse process-
ing tasks with high potential for improving trans-
lation systems.
Historically MT researchers have focused their
attention on the mismatch of linear realization of
syntactic arguments (Galley et al., 2004; Collins
et al., 2005), lexico-morphological mismatch
(Minkov et al., 2007; Habash and Sadat, 2006)
and word polysemy (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan
et al., 2007). Discourse structure has largely been
considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the as-
sumption that discourse analysis is needed to inter-
pret multi-sentential text while statistical MT sys-
tems are trained to translate a single sentence in
one language into a single sentence in another.
However, discourse devices are at play in the or-
ganization of information into complex sentences.
The mere definition of sentence may differ across
languages. Chinese for example is anecdotally
known to allow for very long sentences which at
times require the use of multiple English sentences
to express the same content and preserve gram-
maticality. Similarly discourse connectives like
because, but, since and while often relate informa-
tion expressed in simple sentential clauses. There
are a number of possible complications in trans-
lating these connectives: they may be ambiguous
between possible senses, e.g., English while is am-
biguous between COMPARISON and TEMPORAL;
explicit discourse connectives may be translated
into implicit discourse relations or translated in
morphology rather than lexical items (Meyer and
Webber, 2013; Meyer and Pol´akov´a, 2013).
In our work, we quantify the relationship be-
tween information packaging, discourse devices,
and translation quality.

We examine the quality of translations to English
from Chinese and Arabic using Human-targeted
Translation Edit Rates (HTER) (Snover et al.,
2006), which roughly captures the minimal num-
ber of edits necessary to transform the system
output into an acceptable English translation of
the source sentence. By comparing MT output
with post-edited references, HTER provides more
reliable estimates of translation quality than us-
ing translated references, especially at the seg-
ment level. The data for the analysis is drawn
from an extended set of newswire reports in the
2008/2010 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation

GALE Evaluation set1. For Chinese, there are
305 sentences (segments) translated to English by
three different translation systems. For Arabic,
there are 363 Arabic sentences (segments) trans-
lated by two systems.
The presence of discourse devices is analyzed
only on the English side: the reference, the system
hypothesis and its edited translation. Discourse
connectives and their senses are identified using
existing tools developed for English. Beyond its
practical limitations, analyzing the reference inter-
estingly reflects the choices made by the human
translator: whether to choose to use a discourse
connective, or to insert one to make an implicit re-
lation on the source side explicit on the target side.
We first conduct analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with HTER as dependent variable and the dis-
course factors as independent variables, and sys-
tems as subjects. We examine within-subject sig-
nificance in each ANOVA model. For discourse
factors that are significant at the 95% confidence
level or higher according to the ANOVA analy-
sis, we provide detailed breakdown of the system
HTER for each value of the discourse factor.
In this paper we do not compare the perfor-
mance of individual systems, but instead seek to
understand if a discourse phenomena is problem-
atic across systems.2

3 Sentence length and HTER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959823529412">
The presence of complex discourse structure is
likely to be associated with longer sentences. It
stands to reason that long sentences will be harder
to process automatically and this reasoning has
motivated the first approaches to text simplifica-
tion (Chandrasekar et al., 1996). So before turning
to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we exam-
ine the correlation between translation quality and
sentence length. A strong correlation between the
two would call for revival of interest in text sim-
plification where syntactically complex sentences
are transformed into several shorter sentences as a
preprocessing step.
We find however that no strong relationship ex-
ists between the two, as shown by the correlation
coefficients between HTER values and the number
of words in each segment in Table 1.

4 When a sentence becomes discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976787619047619">
Some languages allow more information to be
packed into a single sentence than is possible in
another language, making single-sentence transla-
tions cumbersome and often ungrammatical. Chi-
nese is known for sentences of this kind; for exam-
ple, the usage of punctuation is very different in
Chinese in the sense that a comma can sometimes
function as a full stop in English, motivating a se-
ries of disambiguation tasks (Jin et al., 2004; Xue
and Yang, 2011; Xu and Li, 2013). Special han-
dling of long Chinese sentences were also shown
to improve machine translation (Jin and Liu, 2010;
Yin et al., 2007).
To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the
source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case)
that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the
target language (English for the purposes of this
study), we separate the translation segments in the
source language into two classes: a source sen-
tence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation
consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the
reference contains more than one sentence.
For Chinese, 26.2% of the source segments are
1-many. These sentences tend to be much longer
than average (36.6% of all words in all reference
translations are part of such segments). For Ara-
bic, the numbers are 15.2% and 26.3%, respec-
tively. Below is an example of a 1-many Chinese
segment, along with the human reference and its
translation by one of the systems:

1-many) as the independent variable and systems
treated as subjects. The test revealed that there is
a significant difference in translation quality be-
tween 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but
not for Arabic. For the Chinese to English systems
we further ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test to iden-
tify the statistical significance in performance for
individual systems. For two of the three systems
the difference is significant, as shown in Table 2.
We have now established that 1-many segments
in Chinese to English translation are highly preva-
lent and their translations are of consistently lower
quality compared to 1-1 segments. This finding
suggests a cross language discourse analysis task
of identifying Chinese sentences that cannot be
translated into single English sentences. This task
may be related to existing efforts in comma dis-
ambiguation in Chinese (Jin et al., 2004; Xue and
Yang, 2011; Xu and Li, 2013) but the relation-
ship between the two problems needs to be clar-
ified in follow up work. Once 1-many segments
are identified, source-side text simplification tech-
niques may be developed (Siddharthan, 2006) to
improve translation quality.

Explicit discourse relations such as COMPARISON,

and relation senses of one hundred pre-selected
discourse connectives over the news portion of
the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
Based on the PDTB, accurate systems for explicit
discourse relation identification have been devel-

We identify discourse connectives and their senses
(TEMPORAL, COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY or
EXPANSION) in each reference segment using the
system in Pitler and Nenkova (2009)3. We com-
pare the translation quality obtained on segments
with reference translation containing no discourse
connective, exactly one discourse connective and
more than one discourse connective.
The ANOVA indicates that the number of con-
nectives is not a significant factor for Arabic trans-
lation, but significantly impacts Chinese transla-
tion quality. A closer inspection using Wilcoxon
rank sum tests reveals that the difference in trans-
lation quality is statistically significant only be-
tween the groups of segments with no connective
vs. those with more than one connective. Addi-
tionally, we ran Wilcoxon rank sum test over 1-
1 and 1-many segments individually and find that
the presence of discourse connectives is associated
with worse quality only in the latter case. Effects
above are illustrated in Table 3.

SON or TEMPORAL relations and since can signal
either CONTINGENCY or TEMPORAL. In transla-
tion this becomes a problem when the ambiguity
is present in one language but not in the other.
In such cases the sense in source ought to be dis-
ambiguated before translation. Here we compare
the translation quality of segments which contain
ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference
translation to those that do not. This analysis gives
lower bound on the translation quality degradation
associated with discourse phenomena as it does
not capture problems arising from connective am-
biguity on the source side.
We base our classification of discourse connec-
tives into ambiguous or not according to the dis-
tribution of their senses in the PDTB. We call a
connective ambiguous if its most frequent sense
among COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPAN-
SION, TEMPORAL accounts for less than 80% of
occurrence of that connective in the PDTB. Nine-
teen connectives meet this criterion of ambiguity.4
In the ANOVA tests for each language, we com-
pared the quality of segments which contained an
ambiguous connective in the reference with those
that do not, with systems treated as subjects. For
Arabic the presence of ambiguous connective did
not yield a statistically significant difference. The
difference however was highly significant for Chi-
nese, as shown in Table 4.
The finding that discourse connective ambigu-
ity is associated with change in translation quality
for Chinese but not for Arabic is rather interesting.
It appears that the language pair in translation im-
pacts the expected gains from discourse analysis
on translation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999134">
Here we study whether discourse relations of spe-
cific senses pose more difficulties on translations
than others and whether there are interactions be-
tween senses. In the ANOVA analysis we used a
binary factor for each of the four possible senses.
For example, we compare the translation quality
of segments that contain COMPARISON relations
in the reference translation with those that do not.
The relation sense makes a significant differ-
ence in translation quality for Chinese but not for
Arabic. For Chinese specifically sentences that ex-
press CONTINGENCY relations have worse qual-
ity translations than sentences that do not express
CONTINGENCY. One explanation for this ten-
dency may be that CONTINGENCY in Chinese con-
tains more ambiguity with other relations such as
TEMPORAL, as tense is expressed lexically in Chi-
nese (no morphological tense marking on verbs).
Finally, the interaction between COMPARISON and
TEMPORAL is significant for both languages.

HTER values for Chinese.

by Meyer and Webber (2013). An example from
our dataset is shown below:

[edited] Some people may go to university to receive profes-
sional game education, and later(Temporal) be appointed by
the big game manufacturers as technical advisers.
The system fails to translate the discourse con-
nective “而后” (later), leading to a probable mis-
interpretation between receiving education and be-
ing appointed as technical advisors.
Due to the lack of reliable tools and resources,
we approximate mismatches between discourse
expressions in the source and MT output using
discourse-related edits. We identify explicit dis-
course connectives and their senses in the system
translation and the human edited version of that
translation. Then we consider the following mu-
tually exclusive possibilities: (i) there are no dis-
course connectives in either the system output or
the edit; (ii) the system output and its edited ver-
sion contain exactly the same discourse connec-
tives with the same senses; (iii) there is a discourse
connective present in the system output but not in
the edit or vice versa. In the ANOVA we use a
factor with three levels corresponding to the three
cases described above. The factor is significant for
both Chinese and Arabic. In both languages, the
mismatch case (iii) involves significantly higher
HTER than either case (i) or (ii). The human edit
rate in the mismatch class is on average four points
greater than that in the other classes.
Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit ex-
pression of discourse relation is related to the
first problem we studied, i.e., if the source seg-
ment is translated into one or multiple sentences
in English, since discourse relations between adja-
cent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-
sentence ones). For this reason we performed a
Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation qual-
ity of segments with discourse mismatch condi-
tioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many.
For both languages a significant difference was
found for 1-1 sentences but not 1-many. Table 6

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994305">
We showed that translation from Chinese to En-
glish is made more difficult by various discourse
events such as the use of discourse connectives,
the ambiguity of the connectives and the type of
relations they signal. None of these discourse fac-
tors has a significant impact on translation qual-
ity from Arabic to English. Translation quality
from both languages is adversely affected by trans-
lations of discourse relations expressed implicitly
in one language but explicitly in the other or by
paired connectives. Our experiments indicate that
discourse usage may affect machine translation
between some language pairs but not others, and
for particular relations such as CONTINGENCY.
Finally, we established the need to identify sen-
tences in the source language that would be trans-
lated into multiple sentences in English. Espe-
cially in translating from Chinese to English, there
is a large number of such sentences which are cur-
rently translated much worse than other sentences.

<abstract confidence="0.999677409090909">We present a study of aspects of discourse structure — specifically discourse devices used to organize information in a sentence — that significantly impact the quality of machine translation. Our analysis is based on manual evaluations of translations of news from Chinese and Arabic to English. We find that there is a particularly strong mismatch in the notion of what constitutes a sentence in Chinese and English, which occurs often and is associated with significant degradation in translation quality. Also related to lower translation quality is the need to employ multiple explicit discourse connecetc.), as well as the presence of ambiguous discourse connectives in the English translation. Furthermore, the mismatches between discourse expressions across languages significantly impact translation quality.</abstract>

In this paper we do not compare the performance of individual systems, but instead seek to understand if a discourse phenomena is problematic across systems.2 3 Sentence length and HTER The presence of complex discourse structure is likely to be associated with longer sentences. It stands to reason that long sentences will be harder to process automatically and this reasoning has motivated the first approaches to text simplification (Chandrasekar et al., 1996). So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length. A strong correlation between the two would call for revival of interest in text simplification where syntactically complex sentences are transformed into several shorter sentences as a preprocessing step. We find however that no strong relationship exists between the two, as shown by the correlation coefficients between HTER values and the number of words in each segment in Table 1. 1Data used in this work includes more documents and the human edits not presen</context>

This finding suggests a cross language discourse analysis task of identifying Chinese sentences that cannot be translated into single English sentences. This task may be related to existing efforts in comma disambiguation in Chinese (Jin et al., 2004; Xue and Yang, 2011; Xu and Li, 2013) but the relationship between the two problems needs to be clarified in follow up work.

There are a number of possible complications in translating these connectives: they may be ambiguous between possible senses, e.g., English while is ambiguous between COMPARISON and TEMPORAL; explicit discourse connectives may be translated into implicit discourse relations or translated in morphology rather than lexical items (Meyer and Webber, 2013; Meyer and Pol´akov´a, 2013).

Moreover, the expressions themselves are used differently; for example, the paired connective “虽然...但是” (despite...but) in Chinese should not be translated into two redundant connectives in English. It is also possible that the source language contains an explicit discourse ¬(Comp.nTemp.) 16.64* 19.63* 286 connective which is not translated in the target language, as has been quantitatively studied recently by Meyer and Webber (2013).

The goal is to identify discourse processing tasks with high potential for improving translation systems. Historically MT researchers have focused their attention on the mismatch of linear realization of syntactic arguments (Galley et al., 2004; Collins et al., 2005), lexico-morphological mismatch (Minkov et al., 2007; Habash and Sadat, 2006) and word polysemy (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007). Discourse structure has largely been considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the assumption that discourse analysis is needed to interpret multi-sentential text while statistical MT systems are trained to translate a single sentence in one language into a single sentence in another. However, discourse devices are at play in the organization of information into complex sentences. The mere definition of sentence may differ across languages. Chinese for example is anecdotally known to allow for very long sen</context>
