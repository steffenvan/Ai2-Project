Spoken Language Translation systems have
usually been produced for such specific domains as
health care or military use. Ideally, such systems
would be easily portable to other domains in which
translation is mission critical, such as emergency
response or law enforcement. However, porting has in
practice proven difficult. This paper will comment on
the sources of this difficulty and briefly present an
approach to rapid inter-domain portability. Three
aspects will be discussed: (1) large general-purpose
lexicons for automatic speech recognition and
machine translation, made reliable and usable through
interactive facilities for monitoring and correcting
errors; (2) easily modifiable facilities for instant
translation of frequent phrases; and (3) quickly
modifiable custom glossaries. As support for our
approach, we apply our current SLT system, now
optimized for the health care domain, to sample
utterances from the military, emergency service, and
law enforcement domains, with discussion of
numerous specific sentences.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.991728055555555">
Recent years have seen increasing research and
commercial activity in the area of Spoken Language
Translation (SLT) for mission-critical applications. In
the health care area, for instance, such products as
Converser (Dillinger &amp; Seligman, 2006), S-MINDS
(www.fluentialinc.com), and Med-SLT (Bouillon et
al, 2005) are coming into use. For military
applications, products like Phraselator
(www.phraselator.com) and S-MINDS
(www.fluentialinc.com) have been deployed.
However, the demand for real-time translation is by
no means restricted to these areas: it is clear in
numerous other areas not yet extensively addressed –
emergency services, law enforcement, and others.
Ideally, a system produced for one such domain
(e.g., health care) could be easily ported to other
domains. However, porting has in practice proven
difficult. This paper will comment on the sources of

this difficulty and briefly present an approach to rapid
inter-domain portability that we believe is promising.
Three aspects of our approach will be discussed: (1)
large general-purpose lexicons for automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT),
made reliable and usable through interactive facilities
for monitoring and correcting errors; (2) easily
modifiable facilities for instant translation of frequent
phrases; and (3) quickly modifiable custom glossaries.
As preliminary support for our approach, we
apply our current SLT system, now optimized for the
health care domain, to sample utterances from the
military, emergency service, and law enforcement
domains.
With respect to the principal source of the porting
problems affecting most SLT systems to date: most
systems have relied upon statistical approaches for
both ASR and MT (Karat and Nahamoo, 2007;
Koehn, 2008); so each new domain has required
extensive and high-quality in-domain corpora for best
results, and the difficulty of obtaining them has
limited these systems’ portability. The need for in-
domain corpora can be eliminated through the use of a
quite general corpus (or collection of corpora) for
statistical training; but because large corpora give rise
to quickly increasing perplexity and error rates, most
SLT systems have been designed for specialized
domains.
By contrast, breadth of coverage has been a
central design goal of our SLT systems. Before any
optimization for a specific domain, we “give our
systems a liberal arts education” by incorporating
very broad-coverage ASR and MT technology. (We
presently employ rule-based rather than statistical MT
components, but this choice is not essential.) For
example, our MT lexicons for English&lt;&gt;Spanish
translation in the health care area contain roughly
350,000 words in each direction, of which only a
small percentage are specifically health care terms.
Our translation grammars (presently licensed from a
commercial source, and further developed with our
collaboration) are similarly designed to cover the
structures of wide-ranging general texts and spoken
discourse.
To deal with the errors that inevitably follow as
coverage grows, we provide a set of facilities that
enable users from both sides of the language barrier to

interactively monitor and correct such errors. We have
described these interactive techniques in (Dillinger
and Seligman, 2004; Zong and Seligman, 2005;
Dillinger and Seligman, 2006; and Seligman and
Dillinger, 2006). With users thus integrated into the
speech translation loop, automatically translated
spoken conversations can range widely with
acceptable accuracy (Seligman, 2000). Users can
move among domains with relative freedom, even in
advance of lexical or other domain specialization,
because most domains are already covered to some
degree. After a quick summary of our approach (in
Section 2), we will demonstrate this flexibility (in
Section 3).
While our system’s facilities for monitoring and
correction of ASR and MT are vital for accuracy and
confidence in wide-ranging conversations, they can be
time consuming. Further, interactivity demands a
minimum degree of computer and print literacy,
which some patients may lack. To address these
issues, we have developed a facility called
Translation ShortcutsTM, through which prepared
translations of frequent or especially useful phrases in
the current domain can be instantly executed by
searching or browsing. The facility is described in
(Seligman and Dillinger, 2006). After a quick
description of the Translation Shortcuts facility
(Section 4), this paper will emphasize the contribution
of the Translation Shortcuts facility to domain
portability, showing how a domain-specific set of
Shortcuts can be composed and integrated into the
system very quickly (Section 5).
Finally, while the extensive lexical resources
already built into the system provide the most
significant boost to domain portability in our system,
it will always be desirable to add specialized lexical
items or specialized meanings of existing ones.
Section 6 will briefly present our system’s glossary
import facility, through which lexical items can be
added or updated very quickly. Our concluding
remarks appear in Section 7.

2 Highly Interactive, Broad-coverage
SLT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971573333334">
We now briefly summarize our group’s approach
to highly interactive, broad-coverage SLT. Our
systems stress interactive monitoring and correction
of both ASR and MT.
First, users can monitor and correct the speaker-
dependent speech recognition system to ensure that
the text which will be passed to the machine
translation component is as correct as necessary.
Voice commands (e.g., Scratch That or Correct
&lt;incorrect text&gt;) can be used to repair speech
recognition errors. Thus, users of our SLT systems in
effect serve to enhance the interface between ASR
and MT.
Next, during the MT stage, users can monitor,
and if necessary correct, translation errors.
As an initial safeguard against translation errors,
we supply a back-translation, or re-translation of the
translation. Using this paraphrase of the initial input,
even a monolingual user can make an initial judgment
concerning the quality of the preliminary machine
translation output. If errors are seen, the user can
modify specific parts of the input and retranslate.
(Other systems, e.g. IBM’s MASTOR (Gao et al,
2006), have also employed re-translation. Our
implementations, however, exploit proprietary
technologies to ensure that the lexical senses used
during back-translation accurately reflect those used
in forward translation. We also allow users to modify
part or all of the input before regenerating the
translation and back-translation.)
In addition, if uncertainty remains about the
correctness of a given word sense, we supply a
proprietary set of Meaning CuesTM – synonyms,
definitions, examples, pictures, etc. – which have
been drawn from various resources, collated in a
database (called SELECTTM), and aligned with the
respective lexica of the relevant MT systems. (In the
present English&lt;&gt;Spanish version of the system, this
database contains some 140,000 entries,
corresponding to more than 350,000 lexical entries.
The cues are automatically grouped by meaning, and
cue groups are automatically mapped to MT lexica
using proprietary techniques – thus in effect
retrofitting an MT system with the ability to explain
to users the meanings of its pre-existing lexical
items.) With these cues as guides, the user can
monitor the current, proposed meaning and if
necessary select a different, preferred meaning from
among those available. Automatic updates of
translation and back-translation then follow. (Our
current MT vendor has modified its rule-based
translation engine to allow specification of a desired
sense when translating a word or expression; we
provide guidelines for other vendors to do likewise.
Comparable modifications for statistical MT engines
will entail the setting of temporary weightings that
will bias the selection of word or phrase translations
for the current sentence only.) Future versions of the
system will allow personal word-sense preferences
thus specified in the current session to be optionally
stored for reuse in future sessions, thus enabling a
gradual tuning of word-sense preferences to
individual needs. (However, such persistent personal
preferences will still be applied sentence by sentence,
rather than by permanently modifying lexica or phrase
tables. Further, users will always be able to
temporarily override, or permanently reset, their
personal preferences.) Facilities will also be provided
for sharing such preferences across a working group.
Given such interactive correction of both ASR
and MT, wide-ranging, and even playful, exchanges
become possible (Seligman, 2000). Such interactivity
within a speech translation system enables increased
accuracy and confidence, even for wide-ranging
conversations.

3 Advantages of Very Broad Coverage

for Domain Switching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999471473684211">
This section discusses the advantages of very
broad lexical coverage for rapid domain porting.
Using our interactive SLT system in its present
configuration, optimized for the health care domain
but with a general-purpose foundation of over 60,000
lexical items for ASR and 350,000 lexical items for
rule-based MT, we will test several input sentences
from each of three distinct domains in which
translation is mission-critical – military, emergency
response, and law enforcement. The test sentences
were invented by the authors; readers can judge their
plausibility. They were pronounced by Seligman
using the built-in microphone of a Motion Computing
LE1600 tablet PC equipped with a push-to-talk
button.
For each input, we will show (1) the English
input, (2) the original Spanish translation, and (3) the
English back-translation. We also comment on several
factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9830312">
• If ASR errors occurred, we describe their
interactive resolution. (All inputs were corrected
before proceeding with translation. All
corrections were made by voice.)
• If our Meaning Cues facility indicated
questionable meanings for any of the expressions
in the input, we note the problems and describe
the resolutions.
• Some problems in translation result from bugs or
gaps in the translation component. These are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719580645161">
marked for repair. (Because our MT components
are presently rule-based, we can address such
problems individually and manually. If a
statistical MT component were used instead, the
recorded errors could guide the selection of texts
for further training.)
As mentioned, in our system, the back-translation
is designed to function as the first line of defense
against inadequate translation. If an unsatisfactory
back-translation is obtained, we advise users to re-
phrase the input and translate again until satisfied.
(False negatives sometimes occur, though we work to
eliminate them; however, it is best to err on the side of
caution.) If the back-translation is satisfactory, we
advise checking the Meaning Cues as a defense
against false positives. These may result if an am-
biguous English input word is translated into Spanish
in the wrong sense (for instance, bank may be trans-
lated as banco (&amp;quot;financial institution&amp;quot;) when orilla del
río (&amp;quot;riverbank&amp;quot;) is wanted), but is nevertheless re-
translated as the same ambiguous English word
(bank). We are experimenting with mechanisms to
eliminate such cases by substituting non-ambiguous
synonyms in the back-translation for ambiguous input
words. In the current tests, if back-translations are
judged insufficient to convey the intended meaning,
paraphrases are substituted and any lexical translation
errors are corrected until acceptable results are
achieved. All such paraphrases are displayed below,
whether they involve simple word substitutions or
more extensive changes.

4 Translation Shortcuts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852444444445">
Having summarized our approach to highly
interactive speech translation and discussed the
advantages of very broad lexical and grammatical
coverage for domain switching, we now turn to the
use of Translation ShortcutsTM in domain ports. This
section briefly describes the facility; and Section 5
explains the methods for quickly updating Shortcuts
as an element of a rapid port.
A Translation Shortcut contains a short
translation, typically of a sentence or two, which has
been pre-verified, whether by a human translator or
through the use of the system’s interactive tools. Thus
re-verification of the translation is unnecessary. In this
respect, Translation Shortcuts provide a kind of
translation memory. However, it is a handmade sort of
memory (since Shortcuts are composed by linguists or
explicitly saved by users) and a highly interactive sort
as well (since users can browse or search for
Shortcuts, can make and categorize their own
Shortcuts, and are advised when the input matches a
Shortcut). It is in the ease of composition or
customization, as well as in the quality of the
interaction, that innovation can be claimed.
We can consider the quality of interaction first.
Access to stored Shortcuts is very quick, with little or
no need for text entry. Several facilities contribute to
meeting this design criterion:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.904666941176471">
• A Shortcut Search facility can retrieve a set of
relevant Shortcuts given only keywords or the
first few characters or words of a string. The
desired Shortcut can then be executed with a
single gesture (mouse click or stylus tap) or voice
command.
NOTE: If no Shortcut is found, the system
automatically allows users access to the full
power of broad-coverage, interactive speech
translation. Thus, a seamless transition is
provided between the Shortcuts facility and
full, broad-coverage translation.
• A Translation Shortcuts Browser is provided, so
that users can find needed Shortcuts by traversing
a tree of Shortcut categories. Using this interface,
users can execute Shortcuts by tapping or
clicking alone.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.755653">
Figure 1 below shows the Shortcut Search and
Shortcuts Browser facilities in use.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.74327275">
• On the left, the Translation Shortcuts Panel
contains the Translation Shortcuts Browser, split
into two main areas, Shortcuts Categories (above)
and Shortcuts List (below).

<listItem confidence="0.779189166666667">
• The Categories section of the Panel shows
current selection of the Nutrition category,
containing frequently used questions and
answers for a nutrition interview. This new
category was created overnight, as described in
Section 5, below. Currently hidden is its Staff
subcategory, containing expressions most
likely to be used by health care staff members.
There is also a Patients subcategory, used for
patient responses. Categories for Background
information, Directions, etc. are also visible.
• Below the Categories section is the Shortcuts
List section, containing a scrollable list of
alphabetized Shortcuts. Double clicking on any
visible Shortcut in the List will execute it.
Clicking once will select and highlight a
Shortcut. Typing Enter will execute any
currently highlighted Shortcut.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998925">
We turn our attention now to the Input
Window, which does double duty for Shortcut
Search and arbitrary text entry for full translation.
The search facility is also shown in Figure 1.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9935259">
• Shortcuts Search begins automatically as soon
as text is entered by any means – voice,
handwriting, touch screen, or standard
keyboard – into the Input Window.
• The Shortcuts Drop-down Menu appears just
below the Input Window, as soon as there are
results to be shown. The user has entered “Do
you have”. The drop-down menu shows the
results of a search within the new Nutrition
category based upon these initial characters.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9823373125">
If the user goes on to enter the exact text of
any Shortcut in this category, e.g. “Do you have
any food allergies?,” the interface will show that
this is in fact a Shortcut, so that verification of
translation accuracy will not be necessary.
However, final text not matching a Shortcut, e.g.
“Do you have any siblings?” will be passed to the
routines for full translation with verification.
A Personal Translation ShortcutsTM facility is
in progress for future versions of the system: once a
user has verified a translation via the interactive
facilities described above, he or she can save it for
future reuse by pressing a Save as Shortcut button.
The new custom Shortcut will then be stored in a
personal profile. Facilities for sharing Shortcuts
will also be provided.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.574869">
Shortcuts for New Domains
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852454545454">
Translation Shortcuts are stored and
distributed as text-format XML files. Each file
contains information about which categories (e.g.
Nutrition) and subcategories (Staff, Patient, etc.)
to which each phrase belongs. Since Shortcuts are
stored as external data files, integration of new
Shortcuts into the system is straightforward and
highly scalable. Once we have built a database of
frequently used expressions and their translations
for a given domain (in which there may be
thousands of expressions or just a few), we can
automatically generate the associated files in XML
format in minutes. Once this new file is added to
the appropriate directory, the Shortcuts become
usable in the next session for text- or voice-driven
searching and browsing. The entire sequence can
be completed overnight. In one case, the Nutrition
Department of a major hospital submitted several
pages of frequently asked questions, which were
entered, translated, re-generated as an XML file,
and integrated into the system for demonstration
the next day.

6 Use of the Glossary Import for Quick
Domain Switching

<bodyText confidence="0.999761444444445">
Similarly, our system includes a glossary import
function which supports quick addition of domain-
specific or other custom lexical information (e.g., site-
specific or client-specific vocabulary), once again in
text format. This glossary file may provide additional
terms or may stipulate preferred (and thus overriding)
translations for existing terms. The glossary file is
automatically generated from a simple, two-column
text-format file in which each line contains the
source-language and target-language terms. A system
utility will then generate the necessary linguistic
markup (in curly brackets in Figure 3) for each of the
terms. (Markup can be elaborated as appropriate for
the machine translation engine in use, e.g. to specify
verb sub-categorization, semantic class, etc.) Like the
XML file used for Translation Shortcuts, the resulting
custom glossary file can simply be placed in the
appropriate directory.

Here, the entry for right establishes the &amp;quot;right-
hand&amp;quot; sense as the system-wide default, overriding the
current global default sense (&amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;). (The new
global default can, however, be overridden in turn by
a personally preferred sense as specified by a user’s
personal profile; and both kinds of preferences can be
overridden interactively for any particular input
sentence.) The other entries are domain-specific
lexical additions for health care not in the general
dictionary.
We make no claims for technical innovation in
our Glossary Import facility, but simply point out its
usefulness for rapid porting, in that new lexical items,
or new preferred senses for old items, can be altered
per user and from session to session.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993461538462">
The principal source of the porting problems
affecting most SLT systems to date, we have
observed, is that, given the general current reliance
upon statistical approaches for both ASR and MT,
each new domain has required an extensive and
difficult-to-obtain new corpus for best results. One
might consider the use of a single very large and quite
general corpus (or collection of corpora) for statistical
training; but large corpora engender quickly
increasing perplexity and error rates, so this very-
broad-coverage approach has generally been avoided.
Our approach, however, has been to adopt a
broad-coverage design nevertheless, and to
compensate for the inevitable increase in ASR and
MT errors by furnishing users with interactive tools
for monitoring and correcting these mistakes. (We
have to date used rule-based rather than statistical MT
components, but comparable interactive facilities
could be supplied for the latter as well. Operational
prototypes for English&lt;&gt;Japanese and
English&lt;&gt;German suggest that the techniques can
also be adapted for languages other than
English&lt;&gt;Spanish.) Because such interactive tools
demand some time and attention, we have also put
into place easily modifiable facilities for instant
translation of frequent phrases (Translation
Shortcuts). And finally, since even systems with very
large lexicons will require specialized lexical items or
specialized meanings of existing ones, we have
implemented a quick glossary import facility, so that
lexical items can be added or updated very easily.
Our current SLT system, optimized for health
care, is now in use at a medium-sized hospital in New
Jersey, with more than twenty machines installed. For
this paper, we have applied the same system, without
modifications, to sample utterances from the military,
emergency service, and law enforcement domains.
While this exercise has yielded no quantitative results,
readers can judge whether it demonstrates that users
can convey mission-critical information with
acceptable reliability in multiple domains, even in
advance of any porting efforts. Users do pay a price
for this flexibility, since time and attention are
required for monitoring and correcting to achieve
reliable results. However, when users judge that
accuracy is not crucial, or when they are unable to
monitor and correct, they can simply accept the first
translation attempt as is. (A bilingual transcript of
each conversation, soon to optionally include the
back-translation, is always available for later
inspection.) They can also gain considerable time
through the use of Translation Shortcuts.

<abstract confidence="0.999867681818182">Spoken Language Translation systems have usually been produced for such specific domains as health care or military use. Ideally, such systems would be easily portable to other domains in which translation is mission critical, such as emergency response or law enforcement. However, porting has in practice proven difficult. This paper will comment on the sources of this difficulty and briefly present an approach to rapid inter-domain portability. Three aspects will be discussed: (1) large general-purpose lexicons for automatic speech recognition and machine translation, made reliable and usable through interactive facilities for monitoring and correcting errors; (2) easily modifiable facilities for instant translation of frequent phrases; and (3) quickly modifiable custom glossaries. As support for our approach, we apply our current SLT system, now optimized for the health care domain, to sample utterances from the military, emergency service, and law enforcement domains, with discussion of numerous specific sentences.</abstract>

In the health care area, for instance, such products as Converser (Dillinger &amp; Seligman, 2006), S-MINDS (www.fluentialinc.com), and Med-SLT (Bouillon et al, 2005) are coming into use. For military applications, products like Phraselator (www.phraselator.com) and S-MINDS (www.fluentialinc.com) have been deployed. However, the demand for real-time translation is by no means restricted to these areas: it is clear in numerous other areas not yet extensively addressed – emergency services, law enforcement, and others. Ideally, a system produced for one such domain (e.g., health care) could be easily ported to other domains. However, porting has in practice proven difficult. This paper will </context>

Next, during the MT stage, users can monitor, and if necessary correct, translation errors. As an initial safeguard against translation errors, we supply a back-translation, or re-translation of the translation. Using this paraphrase of the initial input, even a monolingual user can make an initial judgment concerning the quality of the preliminary machine translation output. If errors are seen, the user can modify specific parts of the input and retranslate. (Other systems, e.g. IBM’s MASTOR (Gao et al, 2006), have also employed re-translation. Our implementations, however, exploit proprietary technologies to ensure that the lexical senses used during back-translation accurately reflect those used in forward translation. We also allow users to modify part or all of the input before regenerating the translation and back-translation.) In addition, if uncertainty remains about the correctness of a given word sense, we supply a proprietary set of Meaning CuesTM – synonyms, definitions, examples, pictures, etc. – which have been drawn from various resources, collated in a database (called SELECTTM), an</context>

(However, such persistent personal preferences will still be applied sentence by sentence, rather than by permanently modifying lexica or phrase tables. Further, users will always be able to temporarily override, or permanently reset, their personal preferences.) Facilities will also be provided for sharing such preferences across a working group. Given such interactive correction of both ASR and MT, wide-ranging, and even playful, exchanges become possible (Seligman, 2000). Such interactivity within a speech translation system enables increased accuracy and confidence, even for wide-ranging conversations. 41 3 Advantages of Very Broad Coverage for Domain Switching This section discusses the advantages of very broad lexical coverage for rapid domain porting. Using our interactive SLT system in its present configuration, optimized for the health care domain but with a general-purpose foundation of over 60,000 lexical items for ASR and 350,000 lexical items for rule-based MT, we will test several input sentences from each of three distinct domains in which transla</context>
