Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787066666667">
In this paper, we describe the 2015 iteration of
the SemEval shared task on Sentiment Analy-
sis in Twitter. This was the most popular sen-
timent analysis shared task to date with more
than 40 teams participating in each of the last
three years. This year’s shared task competi-
tion consisted of five sentiment prediction sub-
tasks. Two were reruns from previous years:
(A) sentiment expressed by a phrase in the
context of a tweet, and (B) overall sentiment
of a tweet. We further included three new sub-
tasks asking to predict (C) the sentiment to-
wards a topic in a single tweet, (D) the over-
all sentiment towards a topic in a set of tweets,
and (E) the degree of prior polarity of a phrase.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916307692308">
Social media such as Weblogs, microblogs, and dis-
cussion forums are used daily to express personal
thoughts, which allows researchers to gain valuable
insight into the opinions of a very large number of
individuals, i.e., at a scale that was simply not pos-
sible a few years ago. As a result, nowadays, sen-
timent analysis is commonly used to study the pub-
lic opinion towards persons, objects, and events. In
particular, opinion mining and opinion detection are
applied to product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), for
agreement detection (Hillard et al., 2003), and even
for sarcasm identification (Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et al.,
2011; Liebrecht et al., 2013).
Early work on detecting sentiment focused on
newswire text (Wiebe et al., 2005; Baccianella et al.,
2010; Pang et al., 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004). As later
research turned towards social media, people real-
ized this presented a number of new challenges.
Misspellings, poor grammatical structure, emoti-
cons, acronyms, and slang were common in these
new media, and were explored by a number of re-
searchers (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al.,
2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Jansen et al., 2009;
Kouloumpis et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2010;
Pak and Paroubek, 2010). Later, specialized shared
tasks emerged, e.g., at SemEval (Nakov et al., 2013;
Rosenthal et al., 2014), which compared teams
against each other in a controlled environment us-
ing the same training and testing datasets. These
shared tasks had the side effect to foster the emer-
gence of a number of new resources, which eventu-
ally spread well beyond SemEval, e.g., NRC’s Hash-
tag Sentiment lexicon and the Sentiment140 lexicon
(Mohammad et al., 2013).1
Below, we discuss the public evaluation done as
part of SemEval-2015 Task 10. In its third year, the
SemEval task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter has
once again attracted a large number of participants:
41 teams across five subtasks, with most teams par-
ticipating in more than one subtask.
This year the task included reruns of two legacy
subtasks, which asked to detect the sentiment ex-
pressed in a tweet or by a particular phrase in a
tweet. The task further added three new subtasks.
The first two focused on the sentiment towards a
given topic in a single tweet or in a set of tweets,
respectively. The third new subtask focused on de-
termining the strength of prior association of Twit-
ter terms with positive sentiment; this acts as an in-
trinsic evaluation of automatic methods that build
Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons with real-valued
sentiment association scores.

In the remainder of this paper, we first introduce
the problem of sentiment polarity classification and
our subtasks. We then describe the process of creat-

Below, we describe the five subtasks of SemEval-
2015 Task 10 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.

<listItem confidence="0.980074086956522">
• Subtask A. Contextual Polarity Disambigua-
tion: Given an instance of a word/phrase in the
context of a message, determine whether it ex-
presses a positive, a negative or a neutral senti-
ment in that context.
• Subtask B. Message Polarity Classification:
Given a message, determine whether it expresses
a positive, a negative, or a neutral/objective senti-
ment. If both positive and negative sentiment are
expressed, the stronger one should be chosen.
• Subtask C. Topic-Based Message Polarity
Classification: Given a message and a topic, de-
cide whether the message expresses a positive, a
negative, or a neutral sentiment towards the topic.
If both positive and negative sentiment are ex-
pressed, the stronger one should be chosen.
• Subtask D. Detecting Trend Towards a Topic:
Given a set of messages on a given topic from
the same period of time, classify the overall sen-
timent towards the topic in these messages as
(a) strongly positive, (b) weakly positive, (c) neu-
tral, (d) weakly negative, or (e) strongly negative.

tion of Twitter Terms with Positive Sentiment
(Degree of Prior Polarity): Given a word/phrase,
propose a score between 0 (lowest) and 1 (high-
est) that is indicative of the strength of association
of that word/phrase with positive sentiment. If a
word/phrase is more positive than another one, it
should be assigned a relatively higher score.

<bodyText confidence="0.992195333333333">
In this section, we describe the process of collect-
ing and annotating our datasets of short social me-
dia text messages. We focus our discussion on the
2015 datasets; more detail about the 2013 and the
2014 datasets can be found in (Nakov et al., 2013)
and (Rosenthal et al., 2014).

3.1 Data Collection
3.1.1 Subtasks A–D
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989058823529">
First, we gathered tweets that express sentiment
about popular topics. For this purpose, we ex-
tracted named entities from millions of tweets, us-
ing a Twitter-tuned NER system (Ritter et al., 2011).
Our initial training set was collected over a one-year
period spanning from January 2012 to January 2013.
Each subsequent Twitter test set was collected a few
months prior to the corresponding evaluation. We
used the public streaming Twitter API to download
the tweets.
We then identified popular topics as those named
entities that are frequently mentioned in association
with a specific date (Ritter et al., 2012). Given this
set of automatically identified topics, we gathered
tweets from the same time period which mentioned
the named entities. The testing messages had differ-
ent topics from training and spanned later periods.
The collected tweets were greatly skewed towards
the neutral class. In order to reduce the class im-
balance, we removed messages that contained no
sentiment-bearing words using SentiWordNet as a
repository of sentiment words. Any word listed in
SentiWordNet 3.0 with at least one sense having a
positive or a negative sentiment score greater than
0.3 was considered a sentiment-bearing word.2
For subtasks C and D, we did some manual prun-
ing based on the topics. First, we excluded top-
ics that were incomprehensible, ambiguous (e.g.,
Barcelona, which is a name of a sports team and also
of a place), or were too general (e.g., Paris, which is
a name of a big city). Second, we discarded tweets
that were just mentioning the topic, but were not re-
ally about the topic. Finally, we discarded topics
with too few tweets, namely less than 10.

to some degree; however, note that the text still contains senti-

Instructions: Subjective words are ones which convey an opinion or sentiment. Given a Twitter message, identify
whether it is objective, positive, negative, or neutral. Then, identify each subjective word or phrase in the context of the
sentence and mark the position of its start and end in the text boxes below. The number above each word indicates its
position. The word/phrase will be generated in the adjacent textbox so that you can confirm that you chose the correct
range. Choose the polarity of the word or phrase by selecting one of the radio buttons: positive, negative, or neutral.
If a sentence is not subjective please select the checkbox indicating that “There are no subjective words/phrases”. If
a tweet is sarcastic, please select the checkbox indicating that “The tweet is sarcastic”. Please read the examples and
invalid responses before beginning if this is your first time answering this hit.

3.1.2 Subtask E 3.2 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924888888889">
We selected high-frequency target terms from the
Sentiment140 and the Hashtag Sentiment tweet cor-
pora (Kiritchenko et al., 2014). In order to re-
duce the skewness towards the neutral class, we
selected terms from different ranges of automati-
cally determined sentiment values as provided by
the corresponding Sentiment140 and Hashtag Sen-
timent lexicons. The term set comprised regular En-
glish words, hashtagged words (e.g., #loveumom),
misspelled or creatively spelled words (e.g., parla-
ment or happeeee), abbreviations, shortenings, and
slang. Some terms were negated expressions such
as no fun. (It is known that negation impacts the
sentiment of its scope in complex ways (Zhu et al.,
2014).) We annotated these terms for degree of sen-
timent manually. Further details about the data col-
lection and the annotation process can be found in
Section 3.2.2 as well as in (Kiritchenko et al., 2014).
The trial dataset consisted of 200 instances, and
no training dataset was provided. Note, however,
that the trial data was large enough to be used as a
development set, or even as a training set. More-
over, the participants were free to use any additional
manually or automatically generated resources when
building their systems for subtask E. The testset in-
cluded 1,315 instances.
Below we describe the data annotation process.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.697487">
3.2.1 Subtasks A–D
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802043478261">
We used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for the an-
notations of subtasks A–D. Each tweet message was
annotated by five Mechanical Turk workers, also
known as Turkers. The annotations for subtasks
A–D were done concurrently, in a single task. A
Turker had to mark all the subjective words/phrases
in the tweet message by indicating their start and
end positions and to say whether each subjective
word/phrase was positive, negative, or neutral (sub-
task A). He/she also had to indicate the overall po-
larity of the tweet message in general (subtask B)
as well as the overall polarity of the message to-
wards the given target topic (subtasks C and D). The
instructions we gave to the Turkers, along with an
example, are shown in Figure 1. We further made
available to the Turkers several additional examples,
which we show in Table 1.
Providing all the required annotations for a given
tweet message constituted a Human Intelligence
Task, or a HIT. In order to qualify to work on our
HITs, a Turker had to have an approval rate greater
than 95% and should have completed at least 50 ap-
proved HITs.

Table 2: Example of a sentence annotated for subjectivity on Mechanical Turk. Words and phrases that were marked
as subjective are in bold italic. The first five rows are annotations provided by Turkers, and the final row shows their
intersection. The last column shows the token-level accuracy for each annotation compared to the intersection.
We further discarded the following types of mes-
sage annotations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999276166666667">
• containing overlapping subjective phrases;
• marked as subjective but having no annotated
subjective phrases;
• with every single word marked as subjective;
• with no overall sentiment marked;
• with no topic sentiment marked.

<bodyText confidence="0.995686181818182">
Recall that each tweet message was annotated by
five different Turkers. We consolidated these anno-
tations for subtask A using intersection as shown in
the last row of Table 2. A word had to appear in 3/5
of the annotations in order to be considered subjec-
tive. It further had to be labeled with a particular
polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) by three of
the five Turkers in order to receive that polarity la-
bel. As the example shows, this effectively shortens
the spans of the annotated phrases, often to single
words, as it is hard to agree on long phrases.

We also experimented with two alternative meth-

the union of the annotations for the sentence, and
(ii) by taking the annotations by the Turker who has
annotated the highest number of HITs. However,
our manual analysis has shown that both alternatives
performed worse than using the intersection.

For subtasks B and C, we consolidated the tweet-
level annotations using majority voting, requiring
that the winning label be proposed by at least three
of the five Turkers; we discarded all tweets for which
3/5 majority could not be achieved. As in previous
years, we combined the objective and the neutral la-
bels, which Turkers tended to mix up.
We used these consolidated annotations as gold
labels for subtasks A, B, C &amp; D. The statistics for all
datasets for these subtasks are shown in Tables 3, 4,
and 5, respectively. Each dataset is marked with the
year of the SemEval edition it was produced for. An
annotated example from each source (Twitter, SMS,
LiveJournal) is shown in Table 6; examples for sen-
timent towards a topic can be seen in Table 7.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961947">
3.2.2 Subtask E
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994953125">
Subtask E asks systems to propose a numerical
score for the positiveness of a given word or phrase.
Many studies have shown that people are actually
quite bad at assigning such absolute scores: inter-
annotator agreement is low, and annotators strug-
gle even to remain self-consistent. In contrast, it
is much easier to make relative judgments, e.g., to
say whether one word is more positive than another.
Moreover, it is possible to derive an absolute score
from pairwise judgments, but this requires a much
larger number of annotations. Fortunately, there are
schemes that allow to infer more pairwise annota-
tions from less judgments.
One such annotation scheme is MaxDiff (Lou-
viere, 1991), which is widely used in market surveys
(Almquist and Lee, 2009); it was also used in a pre-
vious SemEval task (Jurgens et al., 2012).
In MaxDiff, the annotator is presented with four
terms and asked which term is most positive and
which is least positive. By answering just these two
questions, five out of six pairwise rankings become
known. Consider a set in which a judge evaluates A,
B, C, and D. If she says that A and D are the most
and the least positive, we can infer the following:
A &gt; B, A &gt; C, A &gt; D, B &gt; D, C &gt; D. The re-
sponses to the MaxDiff questions can then be easily
translated into a ranking for all the terms and also
into a real-valued score for each term. We crowd-
sourced the MaxDiff questions on CrowdFlower, re-
cruiting ten annotators per MaxDiff example. Fur-
ther details can be found in Section 6.1.2. of (Kir-
itchenko et al., 2014).

3.3 Lower &amp; Upper Bounds
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857037037037">
When building a system to solve a task, it is good
to know how well we should expect it to perform.
One good reference point is agreement between an-
notators. Unfortunately, as we derive annotations by
agreement, we cannot calculate standard statistics
such as Kappa. Instead, we decided to measure the
agreement between our gold standard annotations
(derived by agreement) and the annotations pro-
posed by the best Turker, the worst Turker, and the
average Turker (with respect to the gold/consensus
annotation for a particular message). Given a HIT,
we just calculate the overlaps as shown in the last
column in Table 2, and then we calculate the best,
the worst, and the average, which are respectively
13/13, 9/13 and 11/13, in the example. Finally, we
average these statistics over all HITs that contributed
to a given dataset, to produce lower, average, and
upper averages for that dataset. The accuracy (with
respect to the gold/consensus annotation) for differ-
ent averages is shown in Table 8. Since the overall
polarity of a message is chosen based on majority,
the upper bound for subtask B is 100%. These aver-
ages give a good indication about how well we can
expect the systems to perform. We can see that even
if we used the best annotator for each HIT, it would
still not be possible to get perfect accuracy, and thus
we should also not expect it from a system.

<bodyText confidence="0.999894916666667">
Due to restrictions in the Twitter’s terms of service,
we could not deliver the annotated tweets to the par-
ticipants directly. Instead, we released annotation
indexes and labels, a list of corresponding Twitter
IDs, and a download script that extracts the corre-
sponding tweets via the Twitter API.3
As a result, different teams had access to differ-
ent number of training tweets depending on when
they did the downloading. However, our analysis
has shown that this did not have a major impact and
many high-scoring teams had less training data com-
pared to some lower-scoring ones.

4.1 Subtasks A-C: Phrase-Level,
Message-Level, and Topic-Level Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999823125">
The participating systems were required to perform
a three-way classification, i.e., to assign one of the
folowing three labels: positive, negative or objec-
tive/neutral. We evaluated the systems in terms of a
macro-averaged F1 score for predicting positive and
negative phrases/messages.
We first computed positive precision, Ppos as fol-
lows: we found the number of phrases/messages
that a system correctly predicted to be positive,
and we divided that number by the total number
of examples it predicted to be positive. To com-
pute positive recall, Rpos, we found the number of
phrases/messages correctly predicted to be positive
and we divided that number by the total number
of positives in the gold standard. We then calcu-
lated an F1 score for the positive class as follows
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.791488">
Fpos =2PposRpos
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978417888888889">
Ppos+Rpos . We carried out similar computa-
tions for the negative phrases/messages, Fneg. The
overall score was then computed as the average of
the F1scores for the positive and for the negative
classes: F = (Fpos + Fneg)/2.
We provided the participants with a scorer that
outputs the overall score F, as well as P, R, and
F1 scores for each class (positive, negative, neutral)
and for each test set.

4.2 Subtask D: Overall Polarity Towards a
Topic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
This subtask asks to predict the overall sentiment of
a set of tweets towards a given topic. In other words,
to predict the ratio ri of positive (posi) tweets to the
number of positive and negative sentiment tweets in
the set of tweets about the i-th topic:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.838579">
ri = Posi/(Posi + Negi)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9597984">
Note, that neutral tweets do not participate in the
above formula; they have only an indirect impact on
the calculation, similarly to subtasks A–C.
We use the following two evaluation measures for
subtask D:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922830125">
• AvgDiff (official score): Calculates the abso-
lute difference betweeen the predicted rz and
the gold ri for each i, and then averages this
difference over all topics.
• AvgLevelDiff (unofficial score): This calcula-
tion is the same as AvgDiff, but with rz and
ri first remapped to five coarse numerical cat-
egories: 5 (strongly positive), 4 (weakly pos-
itive), 3 (mixed), 2 (weakly negative), and 1
(strongly negative). We define this remapping
based on intervals as follows:
– 5: 0.8 &lt; x &lt; 1.0
– 4: 0.6 &lt; x &lt; 0.8
– 3: 0.4 &lt; x &lt; 0.6
– 2: 0.2 &lt; x &lt; 0.4
– 1: 0.0 &lt; x &lt; 0.2
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99865">
4.3 Subtask E: Degree of Prior Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831">
The scores proposed by the participating systems
were evaluated by first ranking the terms accord-
ing to the proposed sentiment score and then com-
paring this ranked list to a ranked list obtained
from aggregating the human ranking annotations.
We used Kendall’s rank correlation (Kendall’s T)
as the official evaluation metric to compare the
ranked lists (Kendall, 1938). We also calculated
scores for Spearman’s rank correlation (Lehmann
and D’Abrera, 2006), as an unofficial score.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983833333333">
There were less participants this year, probably
due to having a new similar subtask: C. Notably,
many of the participating teams were newcomers.
We can see that all systems beat the majority
class baseline by 25-40 F1 points absolute on all
datasets. The winning team unitn (using deep con-
volutional neural networks) achieved an F1 of 84.79
on Twitter2015-test, followed closely by KLUEless
(using logistic regression) with F1=84.51.
Looking at the progress datasets, we can see that
unitn was also first on both progress Tweet datasets,
and second on SMS and on LiveJournal. KLUE-
less won SMS and was second on Twitter2013-test.
The best result on LiveJournal was achieved by IOA,
who were also second on Twitter2014-test and third
on the official Twitter2015-test. None of these teams
was ranked in top-3 on Twitter2014-sarcasm, where
the best team was GTI, followed by WarwickDCS.
Compared to 2014, there is an improvement on
Twitter2014-test from 86.63 in 2014 (NRC-Canada)
to 87.12 in 2015 (unitn). The best result on
Twitter2013-test of 90.10 (unitn) this year is very
close to the best in 2014 (90.14 by NRC-Canada).
Similarly, the best result on LiveJournal stays ex-
actly the same, i.e., F1=85.61 (SentiKLUE in 2014
and IOA in 2015). However, there is slight degra-
dation for SMS2013-test from 89.31 (ECNU) in
2014 to 88.62 (KLUEless) in 2015. The results
also degraded for Twitter2014-sarcasm from 82.75
(senti.ue) to 81.53 (GTI).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996772">
5.2 Subtask B: Message-Level Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967206896552">
The results for subtask B are shown in Table 11.
Again, we show results on the five progress test
datasets from 2013 and 2014, in addition to those
for the official Twitter2015-test datasets.
Subtask B attracted 40 teams, both newcomers
and returning, similarly to 2013 and 2014. All
managed to beat the baseline with the exception
of one system for Twitter2015-test, and one for
Twitter2014-test. There is a cluster of four teams
at the top: Webis (ensemble combining four Twit-
ter sentiment classification approaches that partici-
pated in previous editions) with an F1 of 64.84, unitn
with 64.59, lsislif (logistic regression with special
weighting for positives and negatives) with 64.27,
and INESC-ID (word embeddings) with 64.17.
The last column in the table shows the results for
the 2015 sarcastic tweets. Note that, unlike in 2014,
this time they were not collected separately and did
not have a special #sarcasm tag; instead, they are a
subset of 75 tweets from Twitter2015-test that were
flagged as sarcastic by the human annotators. The
top system is IOA with an F1 of 65.77, followed by
INESC-ID with 64.91, and NLP with 63.62.
Looking at the progress datasets, we can see that
the second ranked unitn is also second on SMS and
on Twitter2014-test, and third on Twitter2013-test.
INESC-ID in turn is third on Twitter2014-test and
also third on Twitter2014-sarcasm. Webis and lsislif
were less strong on the progress datasets.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458">
The results for subtask C are shown in Table 12.
This proved to be a hard subtask, and only three
of the seven teams that participated in it managed
to improve over a majority vote baseline. These
three teams, TwitterHawk (using subtask B data
to help with subtask C) with F1=50.51, KLUEless
(which ignored the topics as if it was subtask B) with
F1=45.48, and Whu-Nlp with F1=40.70, achieved
scores that outperform the rest by a sizable margin:
15-25 points absolute more than the fourth team.
Note that, despite the apparent similarity, subtask
C is much harder than subtask B: the top-3 teams
achieved an F1 of 64-65 for subtask B vs. an F1 of
41-51 for subtask C. This cannot be blamed on the
class distribution, as the difference in performance
of the majority class baseline is much smaller: 30.3
for B vs. 26.7 for C.
Finally, the last column in the table reports the
results for the 75 sarcastic 2015 tweets. The win-
ner here is KLUEless with an F1 of 39.26, fol-
lowed by TwitterHawk with F1=31.30, and then by

The results for subtask D are shown in Table 13.
This subtask is closely related to subtask C (in fact,
one obvious way to solve D is to solve C and then
to calculate the proportion), and thus it has attracted
the same teams, except for one. Again, only three
of the participating teams managed to improve over
the baseline; not suprisingly, those were the same
three teams that were in top-3 for subtask C. How-
ever, the ranking is different from that in subtask
C, e.g., TwitterHawk has dropped to third position,
while KLUEless and Why-Nlp have each climbed
one position up to positions 1 and 2, respectively.
Finally, note that avgDiff and avgLevelDiff
yielded the same rankings.

5.5 Subtask E: Degree of Prior Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994586206897">
Ten teams participated in subtask E. Many chose
an unsupervised approach and leveraged newly-
created and pre-existing sentiment lexicons such as
the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, the Sentiment140
Lexicon (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), the MPQA Sub-
jectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and Sen-
tiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), among oth-
ers. Several participants further automatically cre-
ated their own sentiment lexicons from large collec-
tions of tweets. Three teams, including the winner
INESC-ID, adopted a supervised approach and used
word embeddings (supplemented with lexicon fea-
tures) to train a regression model.
The results are presented in Table 14. The last row
shows the performance of a lexicon-based baseline.
For this baseline, we chose the two most frequently
used existing, publicly available, and automatically
generated sentiment lexicons: Hashtag Sentiment
Lexicon and Sentiment140 Lexicon (Kiritchenko et
al., 2014).5 These lexicons have real-valued senti-
ment scores for most of the terms in the test set.
For negated phrases, we use the scores of the cor-
responding negated entries in the lexicons. For each
term, we take its score from the Sentiment140 Lex-
icon if present; otherwise, we take the term’s score
from the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon. For terms not
found in any lexicon, we use the score of 0, which
indicates a neutral term in these lexicons. The top
three teams were able to improve over the baseline.

As in the previous two years, almost all systems used
supervised learning. Popular machine learning ap-
proaches included SVM, maximum entropy, CRFs,
and linear regression. In several of the subtasks, the
top system used deep neural networks and word em-
beddings, and some systems benefited from special
weighting of the positive and negative examples.
Once again, the most important features were
those derived from sentiment lexicons. Other impor-
tant features included bag-of-words features, hash-
tags, handling of negation, word shape and punctua-
tion features, elongated words, etc. Moreover, tweet
pre-processing and normalization were an important
part of the processing pipeline.
Note that this year we did not make a distinc-
tion between constrained and unconstrained sys-
tems, and participants were free to use any addi-
tional data, resources and tools they wished to.
Overall, the task has attracted a total of 41 teams,
which is comparable to previous editions: there were
46 teams in 2014, and 44 in 2013. As in previous
years, subtask B was most popular, attracting almost
all teams (40 out of 41). However, subtask A at-
tracted just a quarter of the participants (11 out of
41), compared to about half in previous years, most
likely due to the introduction of two new, very re-
lated subtasks C and D (with 6 and 7 participants,
respectively). There was also a fifth subtask (E,
with 10 participants), which further contributed to
the participant split.
We should further note that our task was part of
a larger Sentiment Track, together with three other
closely-related tasks, which were also interested in
sentiment analysis: Task 9 on CLIPEval Implicit Po-
larity of Events, Task 11 on Sentiment Analysis of
Figurative Language in Twitter, and Task 12 on As-
pect Based Sentiment Analysis. Another related task
was Task 1 on Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity in
Twitter, from the Text Similarity and Question An-
swering track, which also focused on tweets.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999962">
We have described the five subtasks organized as
part of SemEval-2015 Task 10 on Sentiment Anal-
ysis in Twitter: detecting sentiment of terms in con-
text (subtask A), classifiying the sentiment of an
entire tweet, SMS message or blog post (subtask
B), predicting polarity towards a topic (subtask C),
quantifying polarity towards a topic (subtask D),
and proposing real-valued prior sentiment scores for
Twitter terms (subtask E). Over 40 teams partici-
pated in these subtasks, using various techniques.
We plan a new edition of the task as part of
SemEval-2016, where we will focus on sentiment
with respect to a topic, but this time on a five-
point scale, which is used for human review ratings
on popular websites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor,
Yelp, etc. From a research perspective, moving to an
ordered five-point scale means moving from binary
classification to ordinal regression.
We further plan to continue the trend detection
subtask, which represents a move from classification
to quantification, and is on par with what applica-
tions need. They are not interested in the sentiment
of a particular tweet but rather in the percentage of
tweets that are positive/negative.
Finally, we plan a new subtask on trend detection,
but using a five-point scale, which would get us even
closer to what business (e.g. marketing studies), and
researchers, (e.g. in political science or public pol-
icy), want nowadays. From a research perspective,
this is a problem of ordinal quantification.

<abstract confidence="0.9981413125">In this paper, we describe the 2015 iteration of the SemEval shared task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. This was the most popular sentiment analysis shared task to date with more than 40 teams participating in each of the last three years. This year’s shared task competition consisted of five sentiment prediction subtasks. Two were reruns from previous years: (A) sentiment expressed by a phrase in the context of a tweet, and (B) overall sentiment of a tweet. We further included three new subtasks asking to predict (C) the sentiment towards a topic in a single tweet, (D) the overall sentiment towards a topic in a set of tweets, and (E) the degree of prior polarity of a phrase.</abstract>

In contrast, it is much easier to make relative judgments, e.g., to say whether one word is more positive than another. Moreover, it is possible to derive an absolute score from pairwise judgments, but this requires a much larger number of annotations. Fortunately, there are schemes that allow to infer more pairwise annotations from less judgments. One such annotation scheme is MaxDiff (Louviere, 1991), which is widely used in market surveys (Almquist and Lee, 2009); it was also used in a previous SemEval task (Jurgens et al., 2012). In MaxDiff, the annotator is presented with four terms and asked which term is most positive and which is least positive. By answering just these two questions, five out of six pairwise rankings become known. Consider a set in which a judge evaluates A, B, C, and D. If she says that A and D are the most and the least positive, we can infer the following: A &gt; B, A &gt; C, A &gt; D, B &gt; D, C &gt; D. The responses to the MaxDiff questions can then be easily translated into a ranking for all the terms and also into a real-valued score fo</context>

As a result, nowadays, sentiment analysis is commonly used to study the public opinion towards persons, objects, and events. In particular, opinion mining and opinion detection are applied to product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), for agreement detection (Hillard et al., 2003), and even for sarcasm identification (Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et al., 2011; Liebrecht et al., 2013). Early work on detecting sentiment focused on newswire text (Wiebe et al., 2005; Baccianella et al., 2010; Pang et al., 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004). As later research turned towards social media, people realized this presented a number of new challenges. Misspellings, poor grammatical structure, emoticons, acronyms, and slang were common in these new media, and were explored by a number of researchers (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Jansen et al., 2009; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010).

In contrast, it is much easier to make relative judgments, e.g., to say whether one word is more positive than another. Moreover, it is possible to derive an absolute score from pairwise judgments, but this requires a much larger number of annotations. Fortunately, there are schemes that allow to infer more pairwise annotations from less judgments. One such annotation scheme is MaxDiff (Louviere, 1991), which is widely used in market surveys (Almquist and Lee, 2009); it was also used in a previous SemEval task (Jurgens et al., 2012). In MaxDiff, the annotator is presented with four terms and asked which term is most positive and which is least positive. By answering just these two questions, five out of six pairwise rankings become known. Consider a set in which a judge evaluates A, B, C, and D. If she says that A and D are the most and the least positive, we can infer the following: A &gt; B, A &gt; C, A &gt; D, B &gt; D, C &gt; D.

We used Kendall’s rank correlation (Kendall’s T) as the official evaluation metric to compare the ranked lists (Kendall, 1938). We also calculated scores for Spearman’s rank correlation (Lehmann and D’Abrera, 2006), as an unofficial score.

In order to reduce the skewness towards the neutral class, we selected terms from different ranges of automatically determined sentiment values as provided by the corresponding Sentiment140 and Hashtag Sentiment lexicons. The term set comprised regular English words, hashtagged words (e.g., #loveumom), misspelled or creatively spelled words (e.g., parlament or happeeee), abbreviations, shortenings, and slang.

One good reference point is agreement between annotators. Unfortunately, as we derive annotations by agreement, we cannot calculate standard statistics such as Kappa. Instead, we decided to measure the agreement between our gold standard annotations (derived by agreement) and the annotations proposed by the best Turker, the worst Turker, and the average Turker (with respect to the gold/consensus annotation for a particular message).

However, the ranking is different from that in subtask C, e.g., TwitterHawk has dropped to third position, while KLUEless and Why-Nlp have each climbed one position up to positions 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, note that avgDiff and avgLevelDiff yielded the same rankings. 5.5 Subtask E: Degree of Prior Polarity Ten teams participated in subtask E. Many chose an unsupervised approach and leveraged newlycreated and pre-existing sentiment lexicons such as the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, the Sentiment140 Lexicon (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), among others. Several participants further automatically created their own sentiment lexicons from large collections of tweets. Three teams, including the winner INESC-ID, adopted a supervised approach and used word embeddings (supplemented with lexicon features) to train a regression model. The results are presented in Table 14. The last row shows the performance of a lexicon-based baseline.

Many studies have shown that people are actually quite bad at assigning such absolute scores: interannotator agreement is low, and annotators struggle even to remain self-consistent. In contrast, it is much easier to make relative judgments, e.g., to say whether one word is more positive than another. Moreover, it is possible to derive an absolute score from pairwise judgments, but this requires a much larger number of annotations.

For this purpose, we extracted named entities from millions of tweets, using a Twitter-tuned NER system (Ritter et al., 2011). Our initial training set was collected over a one-year period spanning from January 2012 to January 2013.

Early work on detecting sentiment focused on newswire text (Wiebe et al., 2005; Baccianella et al., 2010; Pang et al., 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004). As later research turned towards social media, people realized this presented a number of new challenges. Misspellings, poor grammatical structure, emoticons, acronyms, and slang were common in these new media, and were explored by a number of researchers (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010; Jansen et al., 2009; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010). Later, specialized shared tasks emerged, e.g., at SemEval (Nakov et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2014), which compared teams against each other in a controlled environment using the same training and testing datasets. These shared tasks had the side effect to foster the emergence of a number of new resources, which eventually spread well beyond SemEval, e.g., NRC’s Hashtag Sentiment lexicon and the Sentiment140 lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013).1 Below, we discuss the public evaluation done as part of SemEval-2015 Task 10.

Finally, note that avgDiff and avgLevelDiff yielded the same rankings. 5.5 Subtask E: Degree of Prior Polarity Ten teams participated in subtask E. Many chose an unsupervised approach and leveraged newlycreated and pre-existing sentiment lexicons such as the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, the Sentiment140 Lexicon (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), among others. Several participants further automatically created their own sentiment lexicons from large collections of tweets. Three teams, including the winner INESC-ID, adopted a supervised approach and used word embeddings (supplemented with lexicon features) to train a regression model. The results are presented in Table 14. The last row shows the performance of a lexicon-based baseline. For this baseline, we chose the two most frequently used existing, publicly available, and automatically generated sentiment lexicons: Hashtag Sentiment Lexi</context>

In order to reduce the skewness towards the neutral class, we selected terms from different ranges of automatically determined sentiment values as provided by the corresponding Sentiment140 and Hashtag Sentiment lexicons. The term set comprised regular English words, hashtagged words (e.g., #loveumom), misspelled or creatively spelled words (e.g., parlament or happeeee), abbreviations, shortenings, and slang. Some terms were negated expressions such as no fun. (It is known that negation impacts the sentiment of its scope in complex ways (Zhu et al., 2014).) We annotated these terms for degree of sentiment manually. Further details about the data collection and the annotation process can be found in Section 3.2.2 as well as in (Kiritchenko et al., 2014). The trial dataset consisted of 200 instances, and no training dataset was provided. Note, however, that the trial data was large enough to be used as a development set, or even as a training set. Moreover, the participants were free to use any additional manually or automatically generated resources when building their systems for subtask E. The testset included 1,315 instances.
