<bodyText confidence="0.999776736842105">
This paper presents a Named Entities (NE)
recognition system for the English written lan-
guage, which combines the wealth of the WORD-
NET taxonomy and the effectiveness of tradi-
tional rule-based approaches. The core of the
system relies on the combination of approxi-
mately 200 language-dependent rules with a set
of predicates, defined on the WORDNET hi-
erarchy, for the identification of both proper
nouns and trigger words. The strengths of
this approach are twofold. First, the use of a
semantic network allows it to cope with the
difficulty of building and maintaining exten-
sive gazetteers. Second, considering the recent
spread of WORD NET-likesemantic networks
for languages other than English and aligned
with the English version, the use of language-
independent predicates offers a useful basis for
achieving multilinguality.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999390178571429">
Named Entities (NE) recognition represents a
crucial aspect in the process of natural lan-
guage understanding. Since up to 10% of a
newswire text may consist of proper names,
dates, times, and similar expressions (Coates-
Stephens, 1992), their effective identification is
required both in Information Extraction and In-
formation Retrieval related tasks.
The NE recognition task has been defined
in the context of the Message Understanding
Conferences (MUC) (Chinchor, 1998) as the ca-
pability of identifying and categorizing entity
names (such as persons, organizations, and loca-
tions names), temporal expressions (dates and
times), and certain types of numerical expres-
sions (monetary values and percentages) in a
written text.
Knowledge-based approaches represent a pos-
sible solution to the NE recognition problem.
Such techniques usually rely on the combina-
tion of a wide range of knowledge sources (for
example, lexical, syntactic, and semantic fea-
tures of the input text as well as world knowl-
edge and discourse level information) and higher
level techniques (e.g. co-reference resolution).
In the context of this framework, dictionar-
ies and extensive gazetteer lists of first names,
company names, and corporate suffixes are of-
ten claimed to be a very useful resource. Al-
though the recourse to list lookup seems to
be a straightforward method to achieve rea-
sonable performance, several works pointed out
that the compilation of gazetteers represents
a bottleneck in the design of an NE recog-
nition system and that their availability for
languages other than English is rather limited
(Cucchiarelli et al., 1998). (Mikheev et al.,
1999) presents an exhaustive discussion about
the drawbacks related to the pure list lookup
approach. Such problems mainly depend on the
required dimensions of reliable gazetteers, on
the difficulty of maintenance of this kind of re-
source (proper names form an open class, mak-
ing the incompleteness of gazetteers an obvi-
ous problem), and on the possibility of overlaps
among the lists (for instance, the name &amp;quot;Wash-
ington&amp;quot; could refer either to a person or to a
location).
The difficulties related to the construction
and maintenance of reliable gazetteers can be
overcome by focusing attention on the presence
in the text of trigger words, i.e. predicates and
constructions typically associated with named
entities (Wakao et al., 1996). Trigger words
often provide a sufficient contextual informa-
tion to determine the class of candidate proper
nouns in their proximity. As an example, sys-
tems designed to deal with this kind of con-
textual information usually access more or less
complete hand-crafted word lists containing ex-
pressions like &amp;quot;President&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Corporation&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;County&amp;quot; in order to recognize respectively per-
son, organization, and location names into a
given text.
According to (McDonald, 1996), the iden-
tification and the classification of a candidate
named entity can be tackled by considering two
kinds of information: internal evidence and ex-
ternal evidence. The former is provided by the
candidate string itself, while the latter is pro-
vided by the context into which the string ap-
pears. As an example, in the sentence, &amp;quot;Judge
Pasco Bowman II, who was appointed by Pres-
ident Ronald Reagan...&amp;quot;, the candidate proper
names &amp;quot;Pasco Bowman II&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ronald Rea-
gan&amp;quot; can be correctly marked with the tag PER-
SON1 either by accessing a database of person
names (i.e. considering their internal evidence)
or by considering the appositives &amp;quot;Judge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;II&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;President&amp;quot;, or the pronoun &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; as ex-
ternal evidence sufficient for disambiguation.
In light of the above considerations, the dis-
tinguishing features of our approach to NE
recognition are the following:
</bodyText>

(i) We avoid the use of gazzeteers; instead,
we exploit WORDNET, a well known resource
freely available (Fellbaum, 1998).
(ii) As a consequence, trigger words assume a
crucial role. In order to identify trigger words
relevant to the NEs categories defined in the
context of the DARPA/NIST HUB4 evaluation

arate them from words bringing internal ev-

idence, we resort on the distinction between
Word_Class and Wordinstance in WORDNET.
Word_Classes often individuate trigger words,
while Word_Instances provide internal evidence.
Our hypothesis is that the huge number of pos-
sible trigger words that can be extracted from
WORDNET compensates for the relatively lim-
ited availability of proper nouns, thus forming
a reliable basis to accomplish NE recognition
without the further use of gazetteer lists.
(iii) The NE recognition system is rule-based.

Rules are designed to take advantage of the
WORDNET taxonomy, in particular of abstrac-
tions induced by the IS-A hierarchy.
An additional advantage (that we have not
yet experimented with) of a WORDNET-based
approach to NE recognition is that, as multi-
lingual semantic networks aligned with the En-
glish version of WORDNET are available, the
construction of multilingual NE recognition sys-
tems becomes a much easier challenge.
This paper is structured as follows: Section
2 introduces our WORDNET-based approach.
Section 3 describes how named entities are rec-
ognized and how high-level rules can be used to
cope with tagging ambiguities and co-reference
resolution. Section 4 shows experimental re-
sults. Section 5 concludes the paper with a dis-
cussion about the presented approach.

2 Exploiting WordNet hierarchy for
NE recognition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997007857142857">
WORDNET is a lexical database whose basic
building block is the synset, a set of synonym
words representing an underlying lexical con-
cept. The 1.6 English version contains 129,505
words organized into 99,642 synsets. In WORD-
NET, two kinds of relations are distinguished:
semantic relations (e.g. IS-A, part-of, cause,
etc.), which hold among synsets, and lexical re-
lations (e.g. synonymy, antonymy), which hold
among words. According to the IS-A (or hyper-
hyponymic) semantic relation, nouns and verbs
are hierarchically organized in a sequence of lev-
els going from generic concepts at the top to
specific concepts at the lower levels.
</bodyText>

2.1 Word Classes and Word Instances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458318181818">
Our criterion for distinguishing between trig-
ger and entity words relies on the distinc-
tion between Word_Class and Word_Instance
in the WORDNET hierarchy. This distinction
has been first introduced in the EuroWord-
Net model (Alonge et al., 1998) to capture
the difference between concepts (e.g. river#1)
and particular instances of those concepts (e.g.
Mississippittl). The two EuroWordNet re-
lations &amp;quot;has_instance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;belongs_to_class&amp;quot;
provide a connection between Word_Classes and
Word _Inst ances
Unfortunately, the WORDNET hierarchy does
not provide such a distinction. The ontologi-
cal confusion among classes and individuals in
WORDNET has been pointed out by (Gangemi
et al., 2002). As an example, they report
the hyponyms of the synset person#1, which
are a mixture of concepts (e.g. &amp;quot;astronomer&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;philosopher&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot;, etc.) and individuals
(e.g. &amp;quot;Galileo Galilei&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Karl Marx&amp;quot;, etc.).
In order to cope with the lack of expressivity
in WORDNET, we devised a semi-automatic
procedure which exploits the IS-A relation
to distinguish between Word_Classes and
Word_Instances. This distinction has been
accomplished in two steps. First, a set of
predicates has been defined for the extrac-
tion of the hyponyms of several high-level
synsets, such as person#1, socialigroup#1,
location#1 and measure#3. Second, instances
have been separated from classes via simple
heuristics (e.g. capitalized words have been
considered as instances, while lower case words
have been considered as Word_Classes) and
then manually checked. Table 1 shows the
distribution of Classes and Instances over the
WORDNET hierarchy with respect to the NE
categories PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZA-
TION, MEASURE, MONEY, DURATION, DATE,
TIME, PERCENT and CARDINAL, which are
the categories considered in the design of our
system.

Given an input text, our rule system cap-
tures external evidence considering all the 12259
words belonging to the relevant Word_Classes
(see Table 1) as possible trigger words.
As an example, among the 6086 hyponyms
of the synset person#1 {person, individual,
someone, somebody, mortal, human, soul}, a
class of 6775 trigger words has been extracted.
Among these, words like &amp;quot;astronomer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;physi-
cist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Norwegian&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;professor&amp;quot; provide
our system with the essential contextual
information for the recognition of a person
name (i.e. &amp;quot;Christopher Hansteen&amp;quot; ) in the text

words also without any contextual information.
Moreover, many words belonging to the
Word_Classes lists can be considered as entities
by virtue of their internal evidence. As an ex-
ample, most of the hyponyms of time unittti
(e.g. &amp;quot;Monday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;mid-January&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;seventies&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Christmas&amp;quot;, etc.) can be correctly considered
either as classes (i.e. trigger words for complex
multiword expressions) or as entity words.

3 Recognition and Classification of
Named Entities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995236">
The process of recognition and identification of
NEs is carried out in three phases.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9854605">
• Preprocessing. In the first phase, the in-
put text is tokenized and words are dis-
ambiguated with their lexical category by
means of a statistical part of speech tag-
ger. Also multiwords recognition is car-
ried out in this phase: about five thousand
multiwords (i.e. collocations, compounds,
and complex terms) have been automat-
ically extracted from WORDNET and are
recognized by pattern matching rules.
• Basic rules application. In the second
phase, a set of approximately 200 basic
rules is used for finding and tagging all the
possible NEs present in the input text.
• Composition rules application. Finally, a
set of higher-level rules is used to resolve
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9104615">
ambiguities between possible multiple tags
as well as for co-reference resolution.
Basic rules and composition rules are de-
scribed in the following two sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998491">
3.1 Basic rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999590409090909">
As stated before, our system has been designed
for the recognition of the NE categories de-
scribed in Table 1. Each category is associated
with a set of basic rules that check for different
features of the input text. These rules may de-
tect the presence of particular word senses, lem-
mas, parts of speech or symbols. The whole set
of basic rules has been manually created in a few
weeks considering, as training data, a small cor-
pus (about 350 Kb) of English newswire texts.
Most of our rules rely on the internal and
external evidence captured via the predicates
defined on the WORDNET hierarchy. As an
example, Tables 3 and 4 describe two rules
containing predicates that can be satisfied only
by particular word senses. In the first rule, the
predicate &amp;quot;proper-person-name-p&amp;quot; is satisfied
by any of the 1202 Instances of the category
PERSON. The rule captures internal evidence
matching any occurrence of these instances
in the input text (e.g. &amp;quot;Galileo&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Galileo
invented the telescope&amp;quot;).
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.8744115">
Table 3: A basic rule matching with &amp;quot;Galileo
invented the telescope&amp;quot;
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.970666178571429">
In the second rule, the predicate &amp;quot;person-p&amp;quot;
is satisfied by any of the 6775 Classes of the
category PERSON. This rule captures contex-
tual evidence matching with sentences formed
by a capitalized noun followed by a verb whose
lemma is &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;, a determiner, and any of these
trigger words (e.g. &amp;quot;astronomer&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Hansteen
was an astronomer&amp;quot;)
Table 4: A basic rule matching with &amp;quot;Hansteen
was an astronomer&amp;quot;
In some cases, the presence of particular
word senses is not required. In fact, external
evidence can often be captured from the con-
text even in the absence of trigger words. As
an example, instead of checking the presence
of particular word senses, the rule described in
Table 5 considers the contextual information
provided by the following sentence structure:
a capitalized noun followed by a comma and
the pronoun &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; (e.g. &amp;quot;Pangborn, who flew
across the Pacific Ocean&amp;quot;).
Percentages and cardinals are handled in the
same way. The reason for this is that these nu-
meric expressions, as well as many temporal ex-
pressions (e.g. &amp;quot;05/15/2002&amp;quot;) in English texts
have a fairly structured appearance which can
be reliably captured by means of simple WORD-
NET-independent rules.

3.2 Composition-Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980144131147541">
The output of the basic rules application phase
is processed by a set of composition rules.
These rules are in charge of handling inclusions
between tagged entities, as well as resolving
co-references between recognized entities and
proper names not yet disambiguated. The fi-
nal output is a version of the original text, in
which all the detected NEs are marked up with
a set of pre-defined SGML tags specifying their
category (for an example, see the NE tagged
text fragments reported in Table 2).
Tag inclusions and co-reference resolution are
handled by rules considering the start/end po-
sition of the tags, the content and the tag type
of the candidate entities.
Inclusions may occur when a recognized
entity contains one or more other entities. As
an example, consider the sentence &amp;quot;Boston is
about 200 miles from New York&amp;quot;. The basic
rules application phase recognizes (besides
the two locations) one entity belonging to
the category CARDINAL (i.e. &amp;quot;200&amp;quot;), which
is included into an entity belonging to the
category MEASURE (i.e. &amp;quot;200 miles&amp;quot;). In
order to cope with inclusions, a hierarchy of
tag categories has been defined. According to
this hierarchy, the categories PERSON, LOCA-
TION and ORGANIZATION are all subsumed
by the more general category NAMEX. In a
similar way, the categories MONEY, MEASURE,
TIME, DURATION, DATE and PERCENT are
all subsumed by the more general category
CARDINAL. In case of tag inclusions, our
system always chooses the most specific ones.
Table 6 shows an example of a composition rule
for handling inclusions (the symbol H is used
to indicate the subsumption relation between
categories).
Co-reference resolution contributes to proper
name classification recognizing, in the input
Table 6: A composition rule for handling inclu-
sions
text, parts of entities that have already been
disambiguated. Often, in fact, the first ref-
erence to an entity includes a relatively full
form of its name (e.g. &amp;quot;Professor Christopher
Hansteen&amp;quot; in the Table 2 examples) (Wa-
cholder et al., 1997). In a kind of discourse
anaphora, other references to the entity take
the form of shorter, more ambiguous variants
(e.g. &amp;quot;Hansteen wrote an atlas of magnetic
strength&amp;quot;). Co-reference resolution aims at
capturing all these variants exploiting the
hierarchy of tag categories described above.
If a proper name has been tagged with the
general category NAMEX, the system checks
if the same name, or a combination of words
containing it, has been found anywhere in the
text and has already been tagged with a more
specific category. If so, the proper name is also
tagged with that more specific category.

In order to evaluate the performance of our
system, an experiment was carried out using
the test corpora and the scoring software pro-
vided in the framework of the DARPA/NIST
HUB4 evaluation exercise (Chinchor et al.,
1998). Scores (i.e. F-measure, Precision and
Recall) are computed by comparing a reference
tagged corpus with an automatically tagged
corpus according to type, content and extension
of each NE. Results achieved over a 365Kb test

The testing phase revealed an acceptable
overall system&apos;s performance: as can be seen,
the F-Measure score for all the tags is around
85%. This result confirms the initial working
hypothesis that a WORDNET-based approach
to NE recognition avoids the difficulties related
to the creation and maintainance of reliable
gazetteers, without a great loss in terms of per-
formance.
We believe that the gap between our system
and the results achieved by rule-based systems
exploiting extensive gazetteer lists can be filled
following two main directions.
First, by improving the basic rules set adding
new rules for some NE categories. As an exam-
ple, Table 8 shows an unforeseen low result for
the category MEASURE. In fact, even though
numerical expressions are in general easier to
handle, the number of constructions commonly
used to express quantities was dramatically un-
derstimated. For instance, no rules were cre-
ated for dealing with expressions of measure like
&amp;quot;a three-judge panel&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a three-turnover per-
formance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a three-and-a-half-game&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a half-
speed grounder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a two-run double&amp;quot;, etc. As
we are currently filling this gap we expect the
next evaluation of the system to give much bet-
ter results.
Further improvements to the system can also
be obtained by moving to WORDNET 1.7, which
contains a significantly larger number of NE
with respect to WORDNET 1.6. As an exam-
ple, if we consider the concepts &amp;quot;philosopher&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;port&amp;quot;, which belong to the categories PER-
SON and LOCATION respectively, we see that
WORDNET 1.7 contains 81 Wordinstances for
the first concept and 157 for the second, while
the 1.6 version contains only 24 and 4 of such
instances. It is important to notice that the
performances of systems based on the use of
gazetteer lists crucially depend on the availabil-
ity and reliability of these resources. As an ex-
ample, (Mikheev et al., 1999) reports that, for
the category LOCATION, the Precision and Re-
call scores of their system decrease from more
than 90% to 50% without the availability of
gazetteers. Even though our approach is not
only focused on capturing internal evidence in
the input text, the system will doubtless benefit
from the availability of the large number of new
Wordinstances present in WORDNET 1.7.

Information Retrieval and Information Extrac-
tion related tasks doubtlessly are among the
most natural applications of semantic networks.
An increasing number of NLP applications ac-
tually take great advantage of the highly struc-
tured WORDNET taxonomy for a wide range of
activities. Among these, NE recognition could
benefit from the availability of WORDNET-like
resources for two main reasons.
First, WORDNET is a free, well known, stan-
dard resource which provides a powerful alter-
native to the use of hand-crafted gazetteer lists.
In this paper we showed how the highly struc-
tured WORDNET hierarchy can be exploited to
cope with the difficulty of building and main-
taining comprehensive lists of proper nouns and
trigger words. The approach presented is based
on the assumption that the huge number of
possible trigger words that can be mined from
WORDNET compensates for the relatively lim-
ited availability of proper nouns. Experimental
results compare well with results achieved by
other rule-based systems and confirm the valid-
ity of our methodology.
Second, the recent spread of multilingual se-
mantic networks aligned with the English ver-
sion of WORDNET makes the construction of
multilingual NE recognition systems quite an
easier challenge. In fact, even though the ba-
sic rules are language-dependent (i.e. any ex-
tension to languages other than English would
require the development of a set of language-
specific rules), the predicates for the extrac-
tion of proper nouns and trigger words from the
WORDNET hierarchy are language-independent
and reusable.
In order to achieve multilinguality, we are
planning to combine our English rule set with
a set of Italian rules. Trigger words and en-
tity words will be extracted from MultiWord-
Net (Pianta et al., 2002), a multilingual lexical
database including information about English
and Italian words. MultiWordNet has been de-
veloped keeping as much as possible of the se-
mantic relations available in the English WORD-
NET: Italian synsets have been created in cor-
respondence with English synsets, importing se-
mantic relations from the corresponding En-
glish synsets. The Italian part of MultiWordNet
currently covers about 40,000 lemmas, strictly
aligned with WORDNET 1.6.

The core of the system relies on the combination of approxirules with a set of predicates, defined on the WORDNET hierarchy, for the identification of both proper and words. strengths of this approach are twofold. First, the use of a semantic network allows it to cope with the difficulty of building and maintaining extensive gazetteers. Second, considering the recent spread of WORD NET-likesemantic networks for languages other than English and aligned with the English version, the use of languageindependent predicates offers a useful basis for achieving multilinguality.</abstract>

According to the IS-A (or hyperhyponymic) semantic relation, nouns and verbs are hierarchically organized in a sequence of levels going from generic concepts at the top to specific concepts at the lower levels. 2.1 Word Classes and Word Instances Our criterion for distinguishing between trigger and entity words relies on the distinction between Word_Class and Word_Instance in the WORDNET hierarchy. This distinction has been first introduced in the EuroWordNet model (Alonge et al., 1998) to capture the difference between concepts (e.g. river#1) and particular instances of those concepts (e.g. Mississippittl). The two EuroWordNet relations &amp;quot;has_instance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;belongs_to_class&amp;quot; provide a connection between Word_Classes and Word _Inst ances Unfortunately, the WORDNET hierarchy does not provide such a distinction. The ontological confusion among classes and individuals in WORDNET has been pointed out by (Gangemi et al., 2002). As an example, they report the hyponyms of the synset person#1, which are a mixture of concepts (e.g. &amp;quot;astronomer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;philosopher&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot;, etc.) and i</context>

Since up to 10% of a newswire text may consist of proper names, dates, times, and similar expressions (CoatesStephens, 1992), their effective identification is required both in Information Extraction and Information Retrieval related tasks. The NE recognition task has been defined in the context of the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) (Chinchor, 1998) as the capability of identifying and categorizing entity names (such as persons, organizations, and locations names), temporal expressions (dates and times), and certain types of numerical expressions (monetary values and percentages) in a written text. Knowledge-based approaches represent a possible solution to the NE recognition problem. Such techniques usually rely on the combination of a wide range of knowledge sources (for example, lexical, syntactic, and semantic features of the input text as well as world knowledge and discourse level information) and higher level techniques (e.g. co-r</context>

In light of the above considerations, the distinguishing features of our approach to NE recognition are the following: (i) We avoid the use of gazzeteers; instead, we exploit WORDNET, a well known resource freely available (Fellbaum, 1998). (ii) As a consequence, trigger words assume a crucial role. In order to identify trigger words relevant to the NEs categories defined in the context of the DARPA/NIST HUB4 evaluation exercise (Chinchor et al., 1998), and to separate them from words bringing internal evidence, we resort on the distinction between Word_Class and Wordinstance in WORDNET. Word_Classes often individuate trigger words, while Word_Instances provide internal evidence. Our hypothesis is that the huge number of possible trigger words that can be extracted from WORDNET compensates for the relatively limited availability of proper nouns, thus forming a reliable basis to accomplish NE recognition without the further use of gazetteer lists.

Scores (i.e. F-measure, Precision and Recall) are computed by comparing a reference tagged corpus with an automatically tagged corpus according to type, content and extension of each NE.

Trigger words often provide a sufficient contextual information to determine the class of candidate proper nouns in their proximity. As an example, systems designed to deal with this kind of contextual information usually access more or less complete hand-crafted word lists containing expressions like &amp;quot;President&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Corporation&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;County&amp;quot; in order to recognize respectively person, organization, and location names into a given text. According to (McDonald, 1996), the identification and the classification of a candidate named entity can be tackled by considering two kinds of information: internal evidence and external evidence. The former is provided by the candidate string itself, while the latter is provided by the context into which the string appears. As an example, in the sentence, &amp;quot;Judge Pasco Bowman II, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan...&amp;quot;, the candidate proper names &amp;quot;Pasco Bowman II&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ronald Reagan&amp;quot; can be correctly marked with the tag PERSON1 either by accessing a database of person names (i.e. considering their internal evide</context>

As an example, if we consider the concepts &amp;quot;philosopher&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;port&amp;quot;, which belong to the categories PERSON and LOCATION respectively, we see that WORDNET 1.7 contains 81 Wordinstances for the first concept and 157 for the second, while the 1.6 version contains only 24 and 4 of such instances. It is important to notice that the performances of systems based on the use of gazetteer lists crucially depend on the availability and reliability of these resources. As an example, (Mikheev et al., 1999) reports that, for the category LOCATION, the Precision and Recall scores of their system decrease from more than 90% to 50% without the availability of gazetteers. Even though our approach is not only focused on capturing internal evidence in the input text, the system will doubtless benefit from the availability of the large number of new Wordinstances present in WORDNET 1.7. 5 Conclusion and future work Information Retrieval and Information Extraction related tasks doubtlessly are among the most natural applications of semantic networks.

Table 6 shows an example of a composition rule for handling inclusions (the symbol H is used to indicate the subsumption relation between categories). Co-reference resolution contributes to proper name classification recognizing, in the input Table 6: A composition rule for handling inclusions text, parts of entities that have already been disambiguated. Often, in fact, the first reference to an entity includes a relatively full form of its name (e.g. &amp;quot;Professor Christopher Hansteen&amp;quot; in the Table 2 examples) (Wacholder et al., 1997). In a kind of discourse anaphora, other references to the entity take the form of shorter, more ambiguous variants (e.g. &amp;quot;Hansteen wrote an atlas of magnetic strength&amp;quot;). Co-reference resolution aims at capturing all these variants exploiting the hierarchy of tag categories described above. If a proper name has been tagged with the general category NAMEX, the system checks if the same name, or a combination of words containing it, has been found anywhere in the text and has already been tagged with a more specific category. If so, the proper name is also tagged with that more specific category</context>

The difficulties related to the construction and maintenance of reliable gazetteers can be overcome by focusing attention on the presence in the text of trigger words, i.e. predicates and constructions typically associated with named entities (Wakao et al., 1996). Trigger words often provide a sufficient contextual information to determine the class of candidate proper nouns in their proximity. As an example, systems designed to deal with this kind of contextual information usually access more or less complete hand-crafted word lists containing expressions like &amp;quot;President&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Corporation&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;County&amp;quot; in order to recognize respectively person, organization, and location names into a given text. According to (McDonald, 1996), the identification and the classification of a candidate named entity can be tackled by considering two kinds of information: in</context>
