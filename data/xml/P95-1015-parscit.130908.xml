We predict discourse segment boundaries
from linguistic features of utterances, using
a corpus of spoken narratives as data. We
present two methods for developing seg-
mentation algorithms from training data:
hand tuning and machine learning. When
multiple types of features are used, results
approach human performance on an inde-

Many have argued that discourse has a global struc-
ture above the level of individual utterances, and
that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phra-
ses, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by
and reflect this structure (cf. (Grosz and Hirschberg,
1992; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Grosz,
1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Hirschberg and
Pierrehumbert, 1986; Hobbs, 1979; Lascarides and
Oberlander, 1992; Linde, 1979; Mann and Thomp-
son, 1988; Polanyi, 1988; Reichman, 1985; Webber,
1991)). However, an obstacle to exploiting the rela-
tion between global structure and linguistic devices
in natural language systems is that there is too little
data about how they constrain one another. We
have been engaged in a study addressing this gap.
In previous work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993),
we reported on a method for empirically validating
global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algo-
rithms to identify these units. We found significant
agreement among naive subjects on a discourse seg-
mentation task, which suggests that global discourse
units have some objective reality. However, we also
found poor correlation of three untuned algorithms
(based on features of referential noun phrases, cue
words, and pauses, respectively) with the subjects&apos;
segmentations.
In this paper, we discuss two methods for develo-
ping segmentation algorithms using multiple know-

ledge sources. In section 2, we give a brief overview
of related work and summarize our previous results.
In section 3, we discuss how linguistic features are
coded and describe our evaluation. In section 4, we
present our analysis of the errors made by the best
performing untuned algorithm, and a new algorithm
that relies on enriched input features and multiple
knowledge sources. In section 5, we discuss our use
of machine learning tools to automatically construct
decision trees for segmentation from a large set of
input features. Both the hand tuned and automa-
tically derived algorithms improve over our previ-
ous algorithms. The primary benefit of the hand
tuning is to identify new input features for impro-
ving performance. Machine learning tools make it
convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use
large feature sets, and to evaluate results using cross-
validation. We discuss the significance of our results
and briefly compare the two methods in section 6.

2 Discourse Segmentation
2.1 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999731571428571">
Segmentation has played a significant role in much
work on discourse. The linguistic structure of Grosz
and Sidner&apos;s (1986) tri-partite discourse model con-
sists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical
relations are isomorphic with intentional structure.
In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)),
segmental structure is an artifact of coherence re-
lations among utterances, and few if any specific
claims are made regarding segmental structure per
se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining re-
lations among utterances, and informs much work
in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and
Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed
the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations.
Although all of these approaches have involved de-
tailed analyses of individual discourses or represen-
tative corpora, we believe there is a need for more
rigorous empirical studies.
Researchers have begun to investigate the ability
of humans to agree with one another on segmen-

tation, and to propose methodologies for quantify-
ing their findings. Several studies have used expert
coders to locally and globally structure spoken dis-
course according to the model of Grosz and Sid-
ner (1986), including (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992;
Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995;
Stifleman, 1995). Hearst (1994) asked subjects
to place boundaries between paragraphs of exposi-
tory texts, to indicate topic changes. Moser and
Moore (1995) had an expert coder assign segments
and various segment features and relations based
on RST. To quantify their findings, these studies
use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Mo-
ser and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau
and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to ap-
pear; Isard and Carletta, 1995).
By asking subjects to segment discourse using a
non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguistic
devices with independently derived segments can
then be investigated in a way that avoids circularity.
Together, (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg
and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995) comprise
an ongoing study using three corpora: professio-
nally read AP news stories, spontaneous narrative,
and read and spontaneous versions of task-oriented
monologues. Discourse structures are derived from
subjects&apos; segmentations, then statistical measures
are used to characterize these structures in terms of
acoustic-prosodic features. Grosz and Hirschberg&apos;s
work also used the classification and regression tree
system CART (Breiman et al., 1984) to automati-
cally construct and evaluate decision trees for classi-
fying aspects of discourse structure from intonatio-
nal feature values. Morris and Hirst (1991) structu-
red a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz
and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based le-
xical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qua-
litatively compared their segmentations with the re-
sults. Hearst (1994) presented two implemented seg-
mentation algorithms based on term repetition, and
compared the boundaries produced to the bounda-
ries marked by at least 3 of 7 subjects, using in-
formation retrieval metrics. Kozima (1993) had 16
subjects segment a simplified short story, developed
an algorithm based on lexical cohesion, and qualita-
tively compared the results. Reynar (1994) propo-
sed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion in con-
junction with a graphical technique, and used infor-
mation retrieval metrics to evaluate the algorithm&apos;s
performance in locating boundaries between conca-
tenated news articles.

2.2 Our Previous Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969156862745">
We have been investigating a corpus of monologues
collected and transcribed by Chafe (1980), known
as the Pear stories. As reported in (Passonneau
and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether
units of global structure consisting of sequences of
utterances could be reliably identified by naive sub-
jects. We analyzed linear segmentations of 20 nar-
ratives performed by naive subjects (7 new subjects
per narrative), where speaker intention was the seg-
ment criterion. Subjects were given transcripts, as-
ked to place a new segment boundary between li-
nes (prosodic phrases)&apos; wherever the speaker had
a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe
the completed segment. Subjects were free to as-
sign any number of boundaries. The qualitative
results were that segments varied in size from 1
to 49 phrases in length (Avg.=5.9), and the rate
at which subjects assigned boundaries ranged from
5.5% to 41.3%. Despite this variation, we found
statistically significant agreement among subjects
across all narratives on location of segment boun-
daries (.114 x 10-6 &lt; p &lt; .6 x 10-9).
We then looked at the predictive power of lin-
guistic cues for identifying the segment boundaries
agreed upon by a significant number of subjects. We
used three distinct algorithms based on the distri-
bution of referential noun phrases, cue words, and
pauses, respectively. Each algorithm (NP-A, CUE-
A, PAUSE-A) was designed to replicate the subjects&apos;
segmentation task (break up a narrative into conti-
guous segments, with segment breaks falling between
prosodic phrases). NP-A used three features, while
CUE-A and PAUSE-A each made use of a single fea-
ture. The features are a subset of those described in
section 3.
To evaluate how well an algorithm predicted seg-
mental structure, we used the information retrie-
val (IR) metrics described in section 3. As repor-
ted in (Passonneau and Litman, to appear), we also
evaluated a simple additive method for combining
algorithms in which a boundary is proposed if each
separate algorithm proposes a boundary. We tested
all pairwise combinations, and the combination of
all three algorithms. No algorithm or combination
of algorithms performed as well as humans. NP-
A performed better than the other unimodal algo-
rithms, and a combination of NP-A and PAUSE-A
performed best. We felt that significant improve-
ments could be gained by combining the input fea-
tures in more complex ways rather than by simply
combining the outputs of independent algorithms.

3.2 Coding of Linguistic Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995587780487805">
Given a narrative of n prosodic phrases, the n-1 po-
tential boundary sites are between each pair of pros-
odic phrases Pi and P+1, i from 1 to n-1. Each
potential boundary site in our corpus is coded using
the set of linguistic features shown in Fig. 2.
Values for the prosodic features are obtained by
automatic analysis of the transcripts, whose con-
ventions are defined in (Chafe, 1980) and illustra-
ted in Fig. 1: &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; indicate sentence-
final intonational contours; &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; indicates phrase-final
but not sentence final intonation; &amp;quot;[X]&amp;quot; indicates
a pause lasting X seconds; &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; indicates a break
in timing too short to be measured. The featu-
res before and after depend on the final punctua-
tion of the phrases Pi and Pi+1, respectively. The
value is `-{-sentence.final.contour&apos; if &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, `-
sentence.finalcontour&apos; if&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;. Pause is assigned &apos;true&apos;
if Pi begins with [X], &apos;false&apos; otherwise. Duration
is assigned X if pause is &apos;true&apos;, 0 otherwise.
The cue phrase features are also obtained by au-
tomatic analysis of the transcripts. Cue&apos; is assigned
&apos;true&apos; if the first lexical item in Pi+i is a member of
the set of cue words summarized in (Hirschberg and
Litman, 1993). Wordi is assigned this lexical item if
2We previously used agreement by 4 subjects as the
threshold for boundaries; for j &gt; 4, agreement was signi-
ficant at the .01% level. (Passonneau and Litman, 1993)
cuei is true, &apos;NA&apos; (not applicable) otherwise.3 Cuez
is assigned &apos;true&apos; if cuei is true and the second lexi-
cal item is also a cue word. Word2 is assigned the
second lexical item if cue2 is true, &apos;NA&apos; otherwise.
Two of the noun phrase (NP) features are hand-
coded, along with functionally independent clauses
(FICs), following (Passonneau, 1994). The two aut-
hors coded independently and merged their results.
The third feature, global.pro, is computed from the
hand coding. FICs are tensed clauses that are neit-
her verb arguments nor restrictive relatives. If a new
FIC (C5) begins in prosodic phrase Pi+1, then NPs
in Ci are compared with NPs in previous clauses and
the feature values assigned as follows4:

<listItem confidence="0.903411">
1. coref = `-l-corer if Ci contains an NP that co-
refers with an NP in C5_1; else coref = `-coref&amp;quot;
2. infer= `-i-infer&apos; if Ci contains an NP whose refe-
rent can be inferred from an NP in C5_1 on the
basis of a pre-defined set of inference relations;
else infer = `-infer&apos;
3. global.pro = `-l-global.pro&apos; if Ci contains a defi-
nite pronoun whose referent is mentioned in a
previous clause up to the last boundary assigned
by the algorithm; else global.pro = `-global.pro&apos;

If a new FIC is not initiated in Pi+1, values for all
three features are &apos;NA&apos;.
Cue-prosody, which encodes a combination of
prosodic and cue word features, was motivated by
an analysis of IR errors on our training data, as de-
scribed in section 4. Cue-prosody is &apos;complex&apos; if:
&apos;The cue phrases that occur in the corpus are shown

tiple clauses; these very rare cases are normalized (Pas-
sonneau and Litman, 1993).

The prosodic and cue phrase features were moti-
vated by previous results in the literature. For ex-
ample, phrases beginning discourse segments were
correlated with preceding pause duration in (Grosz
and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992).
These and other studies (e.g., (Hirschberg and Lit-
man, 1993)) also found it useful to distinguish bet-
ween sentence and non-sentence final intonational
contours. Initial phrase position was correlated with
discourse signaling uses of cue words in (Hirschberg
and Litman, 1993); a potential correlation between
discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency
patterns between cue words was also suggested. Fi-
nally, (Litman, 1994) found that treating cue phra-
ses individually rather than as a class enhanced the
results of (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993).
Passonneau (to appear) examined some of the few
claims relating discourse anaphoric noun phrases to
global discourse structure in the Pear corpus. Re-
sults included an absence of correlation of segmental
structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kamey-
ama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast
between full noun phrases and pronouns. As noted
in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features
largely reflect Passonneau&apos;s hypotheses that adja-
cent utterances are more likely to contain expres-
sions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked,
if they occur within the same segment; and that a
definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to re-
fer to an entity that was mentioned in the current
segment, if not in the previous utterance.

The segmentation algorithms presented in the next

evaluated by examining their performance in pre-

for testing. (The remaining 5 narratives are reser-
ved for future research.) The 10 training narratives

range in length from 51 to 162 phrases (Avg.=101.4),
or from 38 to 121 clauses (Avg.=76.8). The 5 test
narratives range in length from 47 to 113 phrases
(Avg.=87.4), or from 37 to 101 clauses (Avg.=69.0).
The ratios of test to training data measured in narra-
tives, prosodic phrases and clauses, respectively, are
50.0%, 43.1% and 44.9%. For the machine learning
algorithm we also estimate performance using cross-
validation (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), as detailed
in Section 5.
To quantify algorithm performance, we use the in-
formation retrieval metrics shown in Fig. 4. Recall
is the ratio of correctly hypothesized boundaries to
target boundaries. Precision is the ratio of hypo-
thesized boundaries that are correct to the total hy-
pothesized boundaries. (Cf. Fig. 4 for fallout and
error.) Ideal behavior would be to identify all and
only the target boundaries: the values for b and c
in Fig. 4 would thus both equal 0, representing no
errors. The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout,
and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values
are 0, 0, 1, and 1. To get an intuitive summary of
overall performance, we also sum the deviation of
the observed value from the ideal value for each me-
tric: (1-recall) + (1-precision) + fallout + error. The
summed deviation for perfect performance is thus 0.
Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we
use the performance of our human subjects as a tar-
get goal for the performance of our algorithms (Gale
et al., 1992). Table 1 shows the average human per-
formance for both the training and test sets of nar-
ratives. Note that human performance is basically
the same for both sets of narratives. However, two

factors prevent this performance from being closer
to ideal (e.g., recall and precision of 1). The first is
the wide variation in the number of boundaries that
subjects used, as discussed above. The second is the
inherently fuzzy nature of boundary location. We
discuss this second issue at length in (Passonneau
and Litman, to appear), and present relaxed IR me-
trics that penalize near misses less heavily in (Lit-
man and Passonneau, 1995).

4 Hand Tuning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985825">
To improve performance, we analyzed the two types
of lit errors made by the original NP algorithm (Pas-
sonneau and Litman, 1993) on the training data.
Type &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of
non-boundaries, were reduced by changing the co-
ding features pertaining to clauses and NPs. Most
&amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors correlated with two conditions used in the
NP algorithm, identification of clauses and of infe-
rential links. The revision led to fewer clauses (more
assignments of &apos;NA&apos; for the three NP features) and
more inference relations. One example of a change
to clause coding is that formulaic utterances having
the structure of clauses, but which function like in-
terjections, are no longer recognized as independent
clauses. These include the phrases let&apos;s see, let me
see, I don&apos;t know, you know when they occur with no
verb phrase argument. Other changes pertained to
sentence fragments, unexpected clausal arguments,
and embedded speech.
Three types of inference relations linking succes-
sive clauses (Ci_1, Ci) were added (originally there
were 5 types (Passonneau, 1994)). Now, a pronoun
(e.g., it, that, this) in Ci referring to an action, event
or fact inferrable from C1_1 links the two clauses. So
does an implicit argument, as in Fig. 5, where the
missing argument of notice is inferred to be the event
of the pears falling. The third case is where an NP
in Ci is described as part of an event that results
directly from an event mentioned in C1-1.
&amp;quot;C&amp;quot; type errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification
of boundaries, often occurred where prosodic and
cue features conflicted with NP features. The origi-
nal NP algorithm assigned boundaries wherever the
three values `-coref&amp;quot;, `-infer&apos;, `-global.pro&apos; (defined in
section 3) co-occurred, represented as the first con-
ditional statement of Fig. 6. Experiments led to the
hypothesis that the most improvement came by as-
signing a boundary if the cue-prosody feature had
the value &apos;complex&apos;, even if the algorithm would not
otherwise assign a boundary, as shown in Fig. 6.

We refer to the original NP algorithm applied to
the initial coding as Condition 1, and the tuned al-
gorithm applied to the enriched coding as Condition
2. Table 2 presents the average IR scores across
the narratives in the training set for both conditi-
ons. Reduction of &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; type errors raises precision,
and lowers fallout and error rate. Reduction of &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;
type errors raises recall, and lowers fallout and error
rate. All scores improve in Condition 2, with pre-
cision and fallout showing the greatest relative im-
provement. The major difference from human per-
formance is relatively poorer precision.
The standard deviations in Table 2 are often close
to 1/4 or 1/3 of the reported averages. This indicates
a large amount of variability in the data, reflecting
wide differences across narratives (speakers) in the
training set with respect to the distinctions recogni-
zed by the algorithm. Although the high standard
deviations show that the tuned algorithm is not well
fitted to each narrative, it is likely that it is overspe-
cialized to the training sample in the sense that test
narratives are likely to exhibit further variation.
Table 3 shows the results of the hand tuned al-
gorithm on the 5 randomly selected test narratives
on both Conditions 1 and 2. Condition 1 results,
the untuned algorithm with the initial feature set,
are very similar to the training set except for worse
precision. Thus, despite the high standard devia-
tions, 10 narratives seems to have been a sufficient
sample size for evaluating the initial NP algorithm.
Condition 2 results are better than condition 1 in
Table 3, and condition 1 in Table 2. This is strong
evidence that the tuned algorithm is a better pre-
dictor of segment boundaries than the original NP
algorithm. Nevertheless, the test results of condition
2 are much worse than the corresponding training re-
sults, particularly for precision (.44 versus .62). This

We use the machine learning program C4.5 (Quin-
lan, 1993) to automatically develop segmentation al-
gorithms from our corpus of coded narratives, where
each potential boundary site has been classified and
represented as a set of linguistic features. The first
input to C4.5 specifies the names of the classes to
be learned (boundary and non-boundary), and the
names and potential values of a fixed set of coding
features (Fig. 2). The second input is the training
data, i.e., a set of examples for which the class and
feature values (as in Fig. 3) are specified. Our trai-
ning set of 10 narratives provides 1004 examples of
potential boundary sites. The output of C4.5 is a
classification algorithm expressed as a decision tree,
which predicts the class of a potential boundary gi-
ven its set of feature values.
Because machine learning makes it convenient to
induce decision trees under a wide variety of con-
ditions, we have performed numerous experiments,
varying the number of features used to code the trai-
ning data, the definitions used for classifying a po-
tential boundary site as boundary or non-boundary5
and the options available for running the C4.5 pro-
gram. Fig. 7 shows one of the highest-performing
learned decision trees from our experiments. This
decision tree was learned under the following condi-
tions: all of the features shown in Fig. 2 were used to
code the training data, boundaries were classified as
discussed in section 3, and C4.5 was run using only
the default options. The decision tree predicts the
class of a potential boundary site based on the featu-
res before, after, duration, cuei, wordi, coref, infer,
and global.pro. Note that although not all available
features are used in the tree, the included features
represent 3 of the 4 general types of knowledge (pros-
ody, cue phrases and noun phrases). Each level of
the tree specifies a test on a single feature, with a
branch for every possible outcome of the test.6 A
branch can either lead to the assignment of a class,
or to another test. For example, the tree initially
branches based on the value of the feature before.
If the value is `-sentence.final.contour&apos; then the first
branch is taken and the potential boundary site is as-
signed the class non-boundary. If the value of before
is `1-sentence.final.contour3 then the second branch
is taken and the feature coref is tested.
The performance of this learned decision tree ave-
raged over the 10 training narratives is shown in
Table 4, on the line labeled &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;. The line

narrative for testing. Note that for each iteration
of the cross-validation, the learning process begins
from scratch and thus each training and testing set
are still disjoint. While this method does not make
sense for humans, computers can truly ignore pre-
vious iterations. For sample sizes in the hundreds
(our 10 narratives provide 1004 examples) 10-fold
cross-validation often provides a better performance
estimate than the hold-out method (Weiss and Ku-
likowski, 1991). Results using cross-validation are
shown in Table 6, and are better than the estimates
obtained using the hold-out method (Table 5), with
the major improvement coming from precision. Bec-
ause a different tree is learned on each iteration, the
cross-validation evaluates the learning method, not

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993104166667">
We have presented two methods for developing seg-
mentation hypotheses using multiple linguistic fea-
tures. The first method hand tunes features and
algorithms based on analysis of training errors. The
second method, machine learning, automatically in-
duces decision trees from coded corpora. Both me-
thods rely on an enriched set of input features com-
pared to our previous work. With each method, we
have achieved marked improvements in performance
compared to our previous work and are approaching
human performance. Note that quantitatively, the
machine learning results are slightly better than the
hand tuning results. The main difference on average
performance is the higher precision of the automated
algorithm. Furthermore, note that the machine lear-
ning algorithm used the changes to the coding fea-
tures that resulted from the tuning methods. This
suggests that hand tuning is a useful method for
understanding how to best code the data, while ma-
chine learning provides an effective (and automatic)
way to produce an algorithm given a good feature
representation.
Our results lend further support to the hypothesis
that linguistic devices correlate with discourse struc-
ture (cf. section 2.1), which itself has practical im-
port. Understanding systems could infer segments
as a step towards producing summaries, while ge-
neration systems could signal segments to increase
comprehensibility.7 Our results also suggest that to
best identify or convey segment boundaries, systems
will need to exploit multiple signals simultaneously.
We plan to continue our experiments by further
merging the automated and analytic techniques, and
evaluating new algorithms on our final test corpus.
Because we have already used cross-validation, we
do not anticipate significant degradation on new test
narratives. An important area for future research
is to develop principled methods for identifying di-
stinct speaker strategies pertaining to how they si-
gnal segments. Performance of individual speakers
varies widely as shown by the high standard deviati-
ons in our tables. The original NP, hand tuned, and
machine learning algorithms all do relatively poorly
on narrative 16 and relatively well on 11 (both in
the test set) under all conditions. This lends sup-
port to the hypothesis that there may be consistent
differences among speakers regarding strategies for
signaling shifts in global discourse structure.

<abstract confidence="0.968820318244172">We predict discourse segment boundaries from linguistic features of utterances, using a corpus of spoken narratives as data. We present two methods for developing segmentation algorithms from training data: hand tuning and machine learning. When multiple types of features are used, results approach human performance on an independent test set (both methods), and using cross-validation (machine learning). Many have argued that discourse has a global structure above the level of individual utterances, and that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phrases, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by and reflect this structure (cf. (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Hobbs, 1979; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992; Linde, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Polanyi, 1988; Reichman, 1985; Webber, 1991)). However, an obstacle to exploiting the relation between global structure and linguistic devices in natural language systems is that there is too little data about how they constrain one another. We have been engaged in a study addressing this gap. work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units. We found significant agreement among naive subjects on a discourse segmentation task, which suggests that global discourse units have some objective reality. However, we also found poor correlation of three untuned algorithms (based on features of referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses, respectively) with the subjects&apos; segmentations. this paper, discuss two methods for develosegmentation algorithms using multiple know- *Bellcore did not support the second author&apos;s work. In section 2, we give a brief overview of related work and summarize our previous results. In section 3, we discuss how linguistic features are coded and describe our evaluation. In section 4, we present our analysis of the errors made by the best performing untuned algorithm, and a new algorithm that relies on enriched input features and multiple knowledge sources. In section 5, we discuss our use of machine learning tools to automatically construct decision trees for segmentation from a large set of input features. Both the hand tuned and automatically derived algorithms improve over our previous algorithms. The primary benefit of the hand tuning is to identify new input features for improving performance. Machine learning tools make it convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use feature to evaluate results using crossvalidation. We discuss the significance of our results and briefly compare the two methods in section 6. Discourse 2.1 Related Work has a significant role in much on The structure of Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure. In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations. all of have involved deanalyses individual discourses or represenwe there is need for more rigorous empirical studies. have begun to the ability humans to agree with one another on segmen- 108 tation, and to propose methodologies for quantifying their findings. Several studies have used expert coders to locally and globally structure spoken discourse according to the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986), including (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Stifleman, 1995). Hearst (1994) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of expository texts, to indicate topic changes. Moser and Moore (1995) had an expert coder assign segments and various segment features and relations based on RST. To quantify their findings, these studies use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Moser and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Isard and Carletta, 1995). By asking subjects to segment discourse using a non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguistic devices with independently derived segments can then be investigated in a way that avoids circularity. Together, (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995) comprise an ongoing study using three corpora: professionally read AP news stories, spontaneous narrative, and read and spontaneous versions of task-oriented monologues. Discourse structures are derived from subjects&apos; segmentations, then statistical measures are used to characterize these structures in terms of acoustic-prosodic features. Grosz and Hirschberg&apos;s work also used the classification and regression tree system CART (Breiman et al., 1984) to automatically construct and evaluate decision trees for classifying aspects of discourse structure from intonational feature values. Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results. Hearst (1994) presented two implemented segmentation algorithms based on term repetition, and compared the boundaries produced to the boundaries marked by at least 3 of 7 subjects, using information retrieval metrics. Kozima (1993) had 16 subjects segment a simplified short story, developed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion, and qualitatively compared the results. Reynar (1994) proposed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion in conjunction with a graphical technique, and used information retrieval metrics to evaluate the algorithm&apos;s performance in locating boundaries between concatenated news articles. Previous Results We have been investigating a corpus of monologues collected and transcribed by Chafe (1980), known as the Pear stories. As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether units of global structure consisting of sequences of could be reliably identified by naive subjects. We analyzed linear segmentations of 20 narratives performed by naive subjects (7 new subjects narrative), where speaker intention segment criterion. Subjects were given transcripts, asked to place a new segment boundary between lines (prosodic phrases)&apos; wherever the speaker had a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe the completed segment. Subjects were free to assign any number of boundaries. The qualitative results were that segments varied in size from 1 to 49 phrases in length (Avg.=5.9), and the rate at which subjects assigned boundaries ranged from 5.5% to 41.3%. Despite this variation, we found statistically significant agreement among subjects across all narratives on location of segment boun- (.114 x &lt; p &lt; .6 x We then looked at the predictive power of linguistic cues for identifying the segment boundaries agreed upon by a significant number of subjects. We used three distinct algorithms based on the distribution of referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses, respectively. Each algorithm (NP-A, CUE- A, PAUSE-A) was designed to replicate the subjects&apos; segmentation task (break up a narrative into contiguous segments, with segment breaks falling between prosodic phrases). NP-A used three features, while CUE-A and PAUSE-A each made use of a single feature. The features are a subset of those described in section 3. To evaluate how well an algorithm predicted segmental structure, we used the information retriedescribed in section 3. As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, to appear), we also evaluated a simple additive method for combining algorithms in which a boundary is proposed if each separate algorithm proposes a boundary. We tested all pairwise combinations, and the combination of all three algorithms. No algorithm or combination of algorithms performed as well as humans. NP- A performed better than the other unimodal algorithms, and a combination of NP-A and PAUSE-A performed best. We felt that significant improvements could be gained by combining the input features in more complex ways rather than by simply combining the outputs of independent algorithms. 3 Methodology Boundary We represent each narrative in our corpus as a sequence of potential boundary sites, which occur between prosodic phrases. We classify a potential bounsite as it as such by at least 3 of the 7 subjects in our earlier study. it is classified as Agreeamong subjects on boundaries at below the .02% level for values of j &gt; 3, where j is We used Chafe&apos;s (1980) prosodic analysis. 109 he&apos;slooking at the girl.

Only 2 of the 7 possible boundary siare classified as 3.2 Coding of Linguistic Features Given a narrative of n prosodic phrases, the n-1 potential boundary sites are between each pair of prosodic phrases Pi and P+1, i from 1 to n-1. Each potential boundary site in our corpus is coded using the set of linguistic features shown in Fig. 2. Values for the prosodic features are obtained by automatic analysis of the transcripts, whose conventions are defined in (Chafe, 1980) and illustrated in Fig. 1: &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; indicate sentencefinal intonational contours; &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; indicates phrase-final but not sentence final intonation; &amp;quot;[X]&amp;quot; indicates a pause lasting X seconds; &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; indicates a break in timing too short to be measured.

Two of the noun phrase (NP) features are handcoded, along with functionally independent clauses (FICs), following (Passonneau, 1994). The two authors coded independently and merged their results. third feature, computed from the hand coding. FICs are tensed clauses that are neither verb arguments nor restrictive relatives.

And either: cue&apos; = 0 cuei = = word2 &apos;and&apos; the same values as Fig. 3 illustrates how the first boundary site in Fig. 1 would be coded using the features in Fig. 2. The prosodic and cue phrase features were motivated by previous results in the literature. For example, phrases beginning discourse segments were correlated with preceding pause duration in (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992). These and other studies (e.g., (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)) also found it useful to distinguish between sentence and non-sentence final intonational contours. Initial phrase position was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993); a potential correlation between discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency patterns between cue words was also suggested. Finally, (Litman, 1994) found that treating cue phrases individually rather than as a class enhanced the results of (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). Passonneau (to appear) examined some of the few claims relating discourse anaphoric noun phrases to global discourse structure in the Pear corpus. Results included an absence of correlation of segmental structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kameyama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast between full noun phrases and pronouns. As noted in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features largely reflect Passonneau&apos;s hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance. 3.3 Evaluation The segmentation algorithms presented in the next two sections were developed by examining only a of narratives. The algorithms are then evaluated by examining their performance in presegmentation on a separate We currently use 10 narratives for training and 5 narratives for testing. (The remaining 5 narratives are reserved for future research.) The 10 training narratives Recall Prec Pal Error SumDev Training Set .63 .72 .06 .12 .83 Test Set .64 .68 .07 .11 .86 Table 1: Average human performance. range in length from 51 to 162 phrases (Avg.=101.4), or from 38 to 121 clauses (Avg.=76.8). The 5 test narratives range in length from 47 to 113 phrases (Avg.=87.4), or from 37 to 101 clauses (Avg.=69.0). The ratios of test to training data measured in narratives, prosodic phrases and clauses, respectively, are 50.0%, 43.1% and 44.9%. For the machine learning we also estimate performance using crossand Kulikowski, 1991), as detailed in Section 5. To quantify algorithm performance, we use the information retrieval metrics shown in Fig. 4. Recall is the ratio of correctly hypothesized boundaries to target boundaries. Precision is the ratio of hypothesized boundaries that are correct to the total hypothesized boundaries. (Cf. Fig. 4 for fallout and error.) Ideal behavior would be to identify all and only the target boundaries: the values for b and c in Fig. 4 would thus both equal 0, representing no errors. The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout, and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values are 0, 0, 1, and 1. To get an intuitive summary of overall performance, we also sum the deviation of the observed value from the ideal value for each metric: (1-recall) + (1-precision) + fallout + error. The summed deviation for perfect performance is thus 0. Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target goal for the performance of our algorithms (Gale et al., 1992). Table 1 shows the average human performance for both the training and test sets of narratives. Note that human performance is basically the same for both sets of narratives. However, two Algorithm Subjects Boundary Non-Boundary Boundary a b Non-Boundary c d = (a+b+c+d) Figure 4: Information retrieval metrics. Recall — ta+c) Precision = 0-1-61 Error 1 1 1 factors prevent this performance from being closer to ideal (e.g., recall and precision of 1). The first is the wide variation in the number of boundaries that subjects used, as discussed above. The second is the inherently fuzzy nature of boundary location. We discuss this second issue at length in (Passonneau and Litman, to appear), and present relaxed IR metrics that penalize near misses less heavily in (Litman and Passonneau, 1995). 4 Hand Tuning To improve performance, we analyzed the two types of lit errors made by the original NP algorithm (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) on the training data. Type &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of non-boundaries, were reduced by changing the coding features pertaining to clauses and NPs. Most &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors correlated with two conditions used in the NP algorithm, identification of clauses and of inferential links. The revision led to fewer clauses (more assignments of &apos;NA&apos; for the three NP features) and more inference relations. One example of a change to clause coding is that formulaic utterances having the structure of clauses, but which function like interjections, are no longer recognized as independent These include the phrases see, let me I don&apos;t know, you know they occur with no verb phrase argument. Other changes pertained to sentence fragments, unexpected clausal arguments, and embedded speech. Three types of inference relations linking succesclauses Ci) were added (originally there were 5 types (Passonneau, 1994)). Now, a pronoun that, this) Ci referring to an action, event fact inferrable from links the two clauses. So does an implicit argument, as in Fig. 5, where the argument of inferred to be the event of the pears falling. The third case is where an NP in Ci is described as part of an event that results directly from an event mentioned in C1-1. &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; type errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of boundaries, often occurred where prosodic and cue features conflicted with NP features. The original NP algorithm assigned boundaries wherever the three values `-coref&amp;quot;, `-infer&apos;, `-global.pro&apos; (defined in section 3) co-occurred, represented as the first conditional statement of Fig. 6. Experiments led to the hypothesis that the most improvement came by asa boundary if the had the value &apos;complex&apos;, even if the algorithm would not otherwise assign a boundary, as shown in Fig. 6.

We refer to the original NP algorithm applied to the initial coding as Condition 1, and the tuned algorithm applied to the enriched coding as Condition 2. Table 2 presents the average IR scores across narratives in the for both conditions. Reduction of &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; type errors raises precision, and lowers fallout and error rate. Reduction of &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; type errors raises recall, and lowers fallout and error rate. All scores improve in Condition 2, with precision and fallout showing the greatest relative improvement. The major difference from human performance is relatively poorer precision. The standard deviations in Table 2 are often close to 1/4 or 1/3 of the reported averages. This indicates a large amount of variability in the data, reflecting wide differences across narratives (speakers) in the training set with respect to the distinctions recognized by the algorithm. Although the high standard deviations show that the tuned algorithm is not well fitted to each narrative, it is likely that it is overspecialized to the training sample in the sense that test narratives are likely to exhibit further variation. Table 3 shows the results of the hand tuned algorithm on the 5 randomly selected test narratives on both Conditions 1 and 2. Condition 1 results, the untuned algorithm with the initial feature set, are very similar to the training set except for worse precision. Thus, despite the high standard deviations, 10 narratives seems to have been a sufficient sample size for evaluating the initial NP algorithm. Condition 2 results are better than condition 1 in Table 3, and condition 1 in Table 2. This is strong evidence that the tuned algorithm is a better predictor of segment boundaries than the original NP algorithm. Nevertheless, the test results of condition 2 are much worse than the corresponding training results, particularly for precision (.44 versus .62).

Learning We use the machine learning program C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) to automatically develop segmentation algorithms from our corpus of coded narratives, where each potential boundary site has been classified and represented as a set of linguistic features. The first input to C4.5 specifies the names of the classes to learned the names and potential values of a fixed set of coding features (Fig. 2). The second input is the training data, i.e., a set of examples for which the class and feature values (as in Fig. 3) are specified. Our training set of 10 narratives provides 1004 examples of potential boundary sites. The output of C4.5 is a classification algorithm expressed as a decision tree, which predicts the class of a potential boundary given its set of feature values. Because machine learning makes it convenient to induce decision trees under a wide variety of conditions, we have performed numerous experiments, varying the number of features used to code the training data, the definitions used for classifying a poboundary site as and the options available for running the C4.5 program. Fig. 7 shows one of the highest-performing learned decision trees from our experiments. This tree under the following conditions: all of the features shown in Fig. 2 were used to code the training data, boundaries were classified as in section 3, and C4.5 using only the default options. The decision tree predicts the class of a potential boundary site based on the featuafter, duration, coref, infer, that although not all available features are used in the tree, the included features represent 3 of the 4 general types of knowledge (prosody, cue phrases and noun phrases). Each level of the tree specifies a test on a single feature, with a for every possible outcome of the A branch can either lead to the assignment of a class, or to another test. For example, the tree initially based on the value of the feature If the value is `-sentence.final.contour&apos; then the first branch is taken and the potential boundary site is asthe class the value of then the second branch taken and the feature tested. The performance of this learned decision tree averaged over the 10 training narratives is shown in Table 4, on the line labeled &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;. The line &amp;quot;Learning shows the results from another and Passonneau, 1995) varies the number of subjects used to determine boundaries. &apos;The actual tree branches on every value of wordt; the figure merges these branches for clarity. before = -sentence.final.contour elseif before = +sentencellnal.contour then if coref = NA then non-boundary elseif corer = +coref then +sentence.iinal.contour then duration &lt; 1.3 then elseif duration &gt; 1.3 then boundary elseif after = -sentence.final.contour then If wordi E {also,basically,because,finally,flrst,like, meanwhile,no,oh,okay,only,see,so,well,where,NA} then non-boundary wordi E {anyway,but,now,or,then} then elseif wordi = and then If duration &lt; 0.6 then non-boundary elseif duration &gt; 0.6 then boundary elseif coref = -coref then If infer = +infer then non-boundary elseif infer = NA then boundary elseif infer = -infer then if after = -sentence.flnal.contour then boundary elseif after = +sentence.iinal.contour then if cues = true then if global.pro = NA then boundary elseif global.pro = -global.pro then boundary elseif global.pro = +global.pro then If duration &lt; 0.65 then non-boundary elseif duration &gt; 0.65 then boundary = then If duration &gt; 0.5 then non-boundary elseif duration &lt; 0.5 then duration &lt; 0.35 then elseif duration &gt; 0.35 then boundary Figure 7: Learned decision tree for segmentation. machine learning experiment, in which one of the default C4.5 options used in &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; is overridden. The &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; tree (not shown due to space restrictions) is more complex than the tree of Fig. 7, but has slightly better performance. Note that &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; performance is comparable to human performance (Table 1), while &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; is slightly better than humans. The results obtained via machine learning are also somewhat better than the results obtained using hand tuning—particularly with respect to precision (&amp;quot;Condition 2&amp;quot; in Table 2), and are a great improvement over the original NP results (&amp;quot;Condition 1&amp;quot; in Table 2). The performance of the learned decision trees averaged over the 5 test narratives is shown in Table 5. Comparison of Tables 4 and 5 shows that, as with the hand tuning results (and as expected), average performance is worse when applied to the testing rather than the training data particularly with respect to precision. However, performance is an improvement over our previous best results (&amp;quot;Condition 1&amp;quot; in Table 3), and is comparable to (&amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;) or very slightly better than (&amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot;) the hand tuning results (&amp;quot;Condition 2&amp;quot; in Table 3). also use the resampling method of crossand Kulikowski, 1991) to estimate performance, which averages results over multiple partitions of a sample into test versus training data.

Note that for of the cross-validation, the learning process begins from scratch and thus each training and testing set are still disjoint. While this method does not make sense for humans, computers can truly ignore previous iterations. For sample sizes in the hundreds (our 10 narratives provide 1004 examples) 10-fold cross-validation often provides a better performance estimate than the hold-out method (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991). Results using cross-validation are shown in Table 6, and are better than the estimates obtained using the hold-out method (Table 5), with the major improvement coming from precision. Because a different tree is learned on each iteration, the cross-validation evaluates the learning method, not decision tree. 6 Conclusion We have presented two methods for developing segmentation hypotheses using multiple linguistic features. The first method hand tunes features and algorithms based on analysis of training errors. The method, machine learning, induces decision trees from coded corpora. Both methods rely on an enriched set of input features compared to our previous work. With each method, we have achieved marked improvements in performance compared to our previous work and are approaching human performance. Note that quantitatively, the machine learning results are slightly better than the hand tuning results. The main difference on average performance is the higher precision of the automated algorithm. Furthermore, note that the machine learning algorithm used the changes to the coding features that resulted from the tuning methods. This suggests that hand tuning is a useful method for how to best code the data, while machine learning provides an effective (and automatic) way to produce an algorithm given a good feature representation. Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that linguistic devices correlate with discourse structure (cf. section 2.1), which itself has practical import. Understanding systems could infer segments as a step towards producing summaries, while generation systems could signal segments to increase Our results also suggest that to best identify or convey segment boundaries, systems need to exploit simultaneously. We plan to continue our experiments by further merging the automated and analytic techniques, and evaluating new algorithms on our final test corpus. Because we have already used cross-validation, we do not anticipate significant degradation on new test narratives. An important area for future research is to develop principled methods for identifying distinct speaker strategies pertaining to how they signal segments. Performance of individual speakers varies widely as shown by the high standard deviations in our tables. The original NP, hand tuned, and machine learning algorithms all do relatively poorly on narrative 16 and relatively well on 11 (both in the test set) under all conditions. This lends support to the hypothesis that there may be consistent differences among speakers regarding strategies for signaling shifts in global discourse structure.</abstract>

As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether units of global structure consisting of sequences of utterances could be reliably identified by naive subjects. We analyzed linear segmentations of 20 narratives performed by naive subjects (7 new subjects per narrative), where speaker intention was the segment criterion. Subjects were given transcripts, asked to place a new segment boundary between lines (prosodic phrases)&apos; wherever the speaker had a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe the completed segment. Subjects were free </context>

Only 2 of the 7 possible boundary sites are classified as boundary. 3.2 Coding of Linguistic Features Given a narrative of n prosodic phrases, the n-1 potential boundary sites are between each pair of prosodic phrases Pi and P+1, i from 1 to n-1. Each potential boundary site in our corpus is coded using the set of linguistic features shown in Fig. 2. Values for the prosodic features are obtained by automatic analysis of the transcripts, whose conventions are defined in (Chafe, 1980) and illustrated in Fig. 1: &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; indicate sentencefinal intonational contours; &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; indicates phrase-final but not sentence final intonation; &amp;quot;[X]&amp;quot; indicates a pause lasting X seconds; &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; indicates a break in timing too short to be measured. The features before and after depend on the final punctuation of the phrases Pi and Pi+1, respectively. The value is `-{-sentence.final.contour&apos; if &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, `- sentence.finalcontour&apos; if&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;.

The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout, and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values are 0, 0, 1, and 1. To get an intuitive summary of overall performance, we also sum the deviation of the observed value from the ideal value for each metric: (1-recall) + (1-precision) + fallout + error. The summed deviation for perfect performance is thus 0. Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target goal for the performance of our algorithms (Gale et al., 1992).

Passonneau (to appear) examined some of the few claims relating discourse anaphoric noun phrases to global discourse structure in the Pear corpus. Results included an absence of correlation of segmental structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kameyama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast between full noun phrases and pronouns. As noted in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features largely reflect Passonneau&apos;s hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance. 3.3 Evaluation The segmentation algorithms presented in the next two sections were developed by</context>

The primary benefit of the hand tuning is to identify new input features for improving performance. Machine learning tools make it convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use large feature sets, and to evaluate results using crossvalidation. We discuss the significance of our results and briefly compare the two methods in section 6. 2 Discourse Segmentation 2.1 Related Work Segmentation has played a significant role in much work on discourse. The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure. In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integr</context>

Machine learning tools make it convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use large feature sets, and to evaluate results using crossvalidation. We discuss the significance of our results and briefly compare the two methods in section 6. 2 Discourse Segmentation 2.1 Related Work Segmentation has played a significant role in much work on discourse. The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure. In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations.

Hearst (1994) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of expository texts, to indicate topic changes. Moser and Moore (1995) had an expert coder assign segments and various segment features and relations based on RST. To quantify their findings, these studies use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Moser and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Isard and Carletta, 1995). By asking subjects to segment discourse using a non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguistic devices with independently derived segments can then be investigated in a way that avoids circularity.

As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether units of global structure consisting of sequences of utterances could be reliably identified by naive subjects. We analyzed linear segmentations of 20 narratives performed by naive subjects (7 new subjects per narrative), where speaker intention was the segment criterion. Subjects were given transcripts, asked to place a new segment boundary between lines (prosodic phrases)&apos; wherever the speaker had a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe the completed segment. Subjects were free to assign any number of boundaries. The qualitative results were that seg</context>

Finally, (Litman, 1994) found that treating cue phrases individually rather than as a class enhanced the results of (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). Passonneau (to appear) examined some of the few claims relating discourse anaphoric noun phrases to global discourse structure in the Pear corpus. Results included an absence of correlation of segmental structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kameyama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast between full noun phrases and pronouns. As noted in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features largely reflect Passonneau&apos;s hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance. 3.3 Evaluation The segmentation algorithms presented in the next two sections were developed by examining only a training set of narratives.

The first is the wide variation in the number of boundaries that subjects used, as discussed above. The second is the inherently fuzzy nature of boundary location. We discuss this second issue at length in (Passonneau and Litman, to appear), and present relaxed IR metrics that penalize near misses less heavily in (Litman and Passonneau, 1995). 4 Hand Tuning To improve performance, we analyzed the two types of lit errors made by the original NP algorithm (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) on the training data. Type &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of non-boundaries, were reduced by changing the coding features pertaining to clauses and NPs. Most &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors correlated with two conditions used in the NP algorithm, identification of clauses and of inferential links. The revision led to fewer clauses (more assignments of &apos;NA&apos; for the three NP features) and more inference relations. One example of a change to clause coding is that formulaic utterances having the structure of clauses, but which function like interjections, are no longer recognized as independent clauses. </context>

Machine learning tools make it convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use large feature sets, and to evaluate results using crossvalidation. We discuss the significance of our results and briefly compare the two methods in section 6. 2 Discourse Segmentation 2.1 Related Work Segmentation has played a significant role in much work on discourse. The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure. In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations. Although all of these approaches have involved detailed analyses of individual discourses or representative corpora, we believe there is a ne</context>

(Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Hobbs, 1979; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992; Linde, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Polanyi, 1988; Reichman, 1985; Webber, 1991)). However, an obstacle to exploiting the relation between global structure and linguistic devices in natural language systems is that there is too little data about how they constrain one another. We have been engaged in a study addressing this gap. In previous work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units. We found significant agreement among naive subjects on a discourse segmentation task, which suggests that global discourse units have some objective reality. However</context>

The 5 test narratives range in length from 47 to 113 phrases (Avg.=87.4), or from 37 to 101 clauses (Avg.=69.0). The ratios of test to training data measured in narratives, prosodic phrases and clauses, respectively, are 50.0%, 43.1% and 44.9%. For the machine learning algorithm we also estimate performance using crossvalidation (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), as detailed in Section 5. To quantify algorithm performance, we use the information retrieval metrics shown in Fig. 4. Recall is the ratio of correctly hypothesized boundaries to target boundaries. Precision is the ratio of hypothesized boundaries that are correct to the total hypothesized boundaries. (Cf. Fig. 4 for fallout and error.) Ideal behavior would be to identify all and only the target boundaries: the values for b and c in Fig. 4 would thus both equal 0, representing no errors. The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout, and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values are</context>

Comparison of Tables 4 and 5 shows that, as with the hand tuning results (and as expected), average performance is worse when applied to the testing rather than the training data particularly with respect to precision. However, performance is an improvement over our previous best results (&amp;quot;Condition 1&amp;quot; in Table 3), and is comparable to (&amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;) or very slightly better than (&amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot;) the hand tuning results (&amp;quot;Condition 2&amp;quot; in Table 3). We also use the resampling method of crossvalidation (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991) to estimate performance, which averages results over multiple partitions of a sample into test versus training data.

Note that for each iteration of the cross-validation, the learning process begins from scratch and thus each training and testing set are still disjoint. While this method does not make sense for humans, computers can truly ignore previous iterations. For sample sizes in the hundreds (our 10 narratives provide 1004 examples) 10-fold cross-validation often provides a better performance estimate than the hold-out method (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991). Results using cross-validation are shown in Table 6, and are better than the estimates obtained using the hold-out method (Table 5), with the major improvement coming from precision. Because a different tree is learned on each iteration, the cross-validation evaluates the learning method, not a particular decision tree. 6 Conclusion We have presented two methods for developing segmentation hypotheses using multiple linguistic features. The first method hand tunes features and algorithms based on analysis of training errors. The second method, machine learning, automatically induces decision </context>
