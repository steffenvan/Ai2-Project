ABSTRACT
We present a progress report on our research
on nominal compounds (NC&apos;s). Recent approaches to
this problem in linguistics and natural language
processing (NLP) are reviewed and criticized. We
argue that the notion of &amp;quot;role nominal&amp;quot;, which is
at the interface of linguistic and extralinguis-
tic knowledge, is crucial for characterizing NC&apos;s
as well as other linguistic phenomena. We examine
a number of constraints on the semantic interpre-
tation rules for NC&apos;s. Proposals are made that
should improve the capability of NLP systems to
deal with NC&apos;s.

I INTRODUCTION

A. Problem Statement
As a first approximation, we define a
&apos;nominal compound (NC) as a string of two or more
nouns having the same distribution as a single
noun, as in example (1):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.829895">
(1) aircraft bomb bay door actuating cylinders
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999560846153846">
We will see below that provisions have to be made
in some cases for intervening adjectives.
NC&apos;s can exhibit various degrees of lexica-
lization, but we will focus our attention on
productive rules for forming novel compounds. As
to their surface syntax, NC&apos;s can assume any
structure generated by the rule N --&gt; N N; accor-
dingly, their structural ambiguity grows exponen-
tially with their length (following the &amp;quot;Catalan
sequence&amp;quot;). How, then, do we determine that the
normal interpretation for (1) imposes the bracke-
ting shown in (2), rather than any of the other
41 syntactically possible bracketings?

B. Goals of the study
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950333333333">
We believe that the analysis of NC&apos;s repre-
sents an important and largely unsolved problem.
From a theoretical point of view this problem
raises the question of how to deal with noun
semantics. And since noun meaning appears to be
closely connected with knowledge of the world,
one is led to explore the modes of interaction
between linguistic and conceptual knowledge.
From an NLP perspective, NC&apos;s have turned
out to be an important stumbling block for sys-
tems that attempt to deal with real-life text,
especially in technical domains, for purposes
such as machine translation (Isabelle, to
appear), information retrieval, etc.
Our ultimate goal is to develop an NLP sys-
tem capable of analyzing large classes of NC&apos;s in
the sublanguage (Kittredge and Lehrberger, 1982)
of aircraft maintenance manuals. We do not aim at
solving all cases, since we believe the problem
to be exceedingly difficult. At the present stage
of our inquiry, we concentrate on the design of a
suitable theoretical framework.
In section II, we present a brief review of
previous work in linguistics and NLP. In sections
III and IV, we examine two aspects of the seman-
tics of nouns that are crucially relevant to the
analysis of NC&apos;s: predicative nouns and role
nominals. Finally, in section V, we explore pos-
sible constraints on the semantic interpretation
of NC&apos;s.

<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
The early study of Lees (1963) classified
NC&apos;s on purely grammatical criteria, and it
failed to provide constraints that could explain
how NC&apos;s are semantically interpreted.
In a number of more recent studies, such as
Levi (1978), there has been an attempt to view
NC&apos;s as governed by tight semantic constraints.
Thus, according to Levi, any novel NC realizes a
pattern where either: a) the head noun is a
deverbal nominalization and its modifier is
interpreted as an argument of the related verb;
or b) the two nouns are related by one of exactly
nine deletable predicates (&amp;quot;is the cause of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;is
for&amp;quot;, etc.).
This reductionist attempt has been criti-
cized, most notably by Downing (1977), on the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999726909090909">
grounds that the interpretation of NC&apos;s crucially
involves pragmatic knowledge, and that numerous
cases of NC&apos;s (such as thalidomide parents) will
resist any analysis in terms of a closed set of
relations. These criticisms have led theorists
like Selkirk (1982) to adopt the position that
only &amp;quot;verbal compounds&amp;quot; (those constructed on a
pattern &amp;quot;argument + nominalization&amp;quot;) are amenable
to linguistic characterization; all other NC&apos;s
would have to be explained in separate extralin-
guistic theories.

C. Approaches in NLP

<bodyText confidence="0.999843147058823">
Several systems have been developed in an
NLP framework to deal with the problem of inter-
preting NC&apos;s; two recent examples are reported in
Finin (1980) and McDonald (1982).
In both systems, the individual nouns of an
NC are first mapped onto conceptual representa-
tions where concepts are characterized by a set
of &amp;quot;roles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot;, and are arranged in an
abstraction hierarchy. Interpreting a compound
then amounts to forming a derived concept on the
basis of the constituent concepts; in most cases,
this is done by interpreting one of the concepts
as a slot filler for the other. For example, the
interpretation of steel adapter would involve
inserting the concept associated with steel into
a RAW-MATERIAL slot within the representation of
adapter. But the authors do not examine in any
detail the question of eventual constraints on
this interpretation process, such as the effect
of word order.
Another crucial issue which has not been
explored in sufficient detail, is the nature of,
and the justification for the particular set of
slots which is assigned to a given concept. Finin
is somewhat more explicit on this question. Some
nouns have slots which represent standard case
roles. Role nominals, on the other hand, are
nouns which refer to a particular case role of
another concept; for example, food refers to the
object role of eat, and this fact provides the
key to the interpretation of cat food. This
notion will be examined in detail below. But
Finin also resorts to other types of slots (e.g.
&amp;quot;raw-material&amp;quot;) which are not discussed.

III PREDICATIVE NOUNS
A. Root Nouns with Arguments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817222222222">
The fact that several classes of non-derived
nouns strictly subcategorize phrases which are
semantically interpreted as arguments has
received very little attention in the literature.
This phenomenon would deserve an extensive study,
and we can only give here some relevant examples,
together with an indication of the semantic cate-
gories between which the relation expressed by
the noun effects a mapping:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.901228296296296">
(3) a. measure nouns
map: objects onto quantities
examples: speed (of), temperature (of),
volume (of), size (of)
b. &amp;quot;area&amp;quot; nouns
map: objects onto subparts
examples: top (of), side (of), bottom
(of), center (of), core (of)
c. collective nouns
map: individuals onto sets
examples: group (of), set (of)
d. representational nouns
map: objects onto representations of ob-
jects
examples: picture (of), diagram (of),
sense (of)
e. other examples
location (of), goal (of),
brother (of), king (of)
Most if not all of these argument-taking nouns
can have their argument satisfied by a modifier
noun in an NC:
(4) a. oil temperature
b. box top
c. tank group
d. circuit diagram
e. component location
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974631217391304">
A treatment in terms of predicate/argument pat-
terns for this type of NC seems far superior to
Levi&apos;s (1978) use of the semantically empty
&amp;quot;deletable predicate&amp;quot; HAVE (&amp;quot;the component HAS a
location&amp;quot;). Although these NC&apos;s are excluded from
Selkirk&apos;s (1982) class of verbal compounds, they
are amenable to the same type of semantic des-
cription.
B. Action and State Nominalizations
Most studies on NC&apos;s have recognized the
fact that deverbal nominalizations exhibit a
semantic behavior closely related to that of the
verb, and subcategorize elements that can occur
as modifier nouns in NC&apos;s. As mentioned above,
these are in fact the only cases that Selkirk
(1982) deems characterizable at the level of
linguistic competence.
But there seems to be no reason why deadjec-
tival nominalizations should be handled in a
different way. In examples (5) and (6), an action
and a state are nominalized, with the argument
occurring either in a prepositional phrase or as
a modifier in an NC:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996483">
(5) a. Someone removes the pump.
b. removal of the pump
c. pump removal
(6) a. Uranium is scarce.

<bodyText confidence="0.998405833333333">
We are not claiming that there is exact
synonymy between the (b) and (c) examples, but
only that they exhibit the same predicate/
argument pattern. Action nominals can take
various types of arguments in NC&apos;s, and sometimes
several of them simultaneously:

IV ROLE NOMINALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95839175">
A. Nominalizations
Deverbal nominalizations can refer not only
to the action expressed by the verb, but also to
the agent (driver), instrument (lubricant), pa-
tient (empii5,-WW) and result (asserdil7)—Eif this
action. Except maybe for results, the term &amp;quot;role
nominal&amp;quot; seems appropriate, since the nominaliza-
tion refers to the filler of one of the roles of
the verb. Although these nouns are not, strictly
speaking, predicative, they generally permit to
form NC&apos;s in which the other is interpreted as an
argument of the underlying verb:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.555417">
(9) truck driver
= one who drives trucks
(10) engine lubricant
= something with which engines are lubri-
cated
(11) IBM employee
= one who is employed by IBM
(12) pump assembly
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980843833333333">
= the result of assembling a pump
With agent and instrument nominals (9, 10), there
is a strong tendency to assign an &amp;quot;habitual&amp;quot;
aspect to the underlying verb and generic refe-
rence to its object; this kind of interpretation
is awkward when the argument appears in a PP:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8695975">
(13) ?a driver of trucks
B. Root Nouns
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853777777778">
The term &amp;quot;role nominal&amp;quot; is due to Finin
(1980) who uses it to cover not only nominaliza-
tions of the type described above, but also any
noun which can be semantically interpreted as
referring to a role of a given verb, whether or
not this verb happens to be morphologically
related. This claims amounts to saying that,
semantically, we have relations such as the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998519">
(14) a. pilot:fly :: driver:drive
b. gun:shoot :: lubricant:lubricate
c. food:eat :: employee:employ
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989304">
A related claim underlies Zholkhovskij &amp;
Mel&apos;cuk&apos;s (1971) use of certain &amp;quot;lexical func-
tions&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95746">
(15) a. S (buy) = buyer
b. Si(buy) = seller
c. S3loc (battle) = battlefield

where S., S and Si are defined as functions
oc nst
4Rt yield the typical name of, respectively, the
i actant, the location and the instrument.
Fillmore (1971) also makes a comparable
proposal, when he suggests that the lexical entry
of knife should include (16) as a component:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.937951">
(16) use: I of &lt;V 0 I A&gt;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.92096909375">
where V=cut
C. On the Definition of Role Nominals
How exactly should we understand the notion
of role nominals? Finin&apos;s statement that they
refer to an underlying case role of a verb is not
accurate: they refer to role fillers, not to the
roles themselves. Assuming that they denote a set
of role fillers, we can ask if this set is:
a. the set of all possible fillers for the
role; or
b. a set of typical fillers for that role;
Or
c. any set of possible fillers for the role.
Possibility (a) seems to describe correctly
numerous cases of deverbal nouns. For example, it
seems clear that anyone who is employed is an
employee. However, with agents and instruments,
there is a tendency to reserve the role nominal
for habitual fillers: one hesitates to apply the
term writer to a person who only wrote a letter.
Moreover, with this definition, knife would not
be a role nominal for cut, since it is perfectly
possible to cut bread with a sword. The notion
would then loose much of its power, since we need
it to explain why bread knife is interpreted as
&amp;quot;a knife used as an instrument for cutting
bread&amp;quot;.
On the other hand, definition (c) seems too
weak: even if a sword can be used to cut bread,
bread sword is odd in a normal context (contex-
tual factors will be discussed below). Thus,
definition (b) seems the most appropriate.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999723333333333">
For those role nominals where there is no
morphological evidence of relatedness with the
underlying verb, one is forced to rely mostly on
intuitions. However, the risk of arbitrariness
can be reduced by looking for further evidence
from other linguistic phenomena.

1. Evaluative Adjectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932851714285715">
When Fillmore (1971) introduced his notion
of role nominal, he was attempting to characte-
rize the behavior of evaluative adjectives, not
the behavior of NC&apos;s. He noted that a .22od X,
where X is a role nominal, means:
a. if X is an agent: one who performs the
associated activity skilfully
(a good driver, a good pianist);
b. if X is an instrument: a thing which
permits the associated activity to be
performed easily
(a good knife, a good broom);
c. In other cases, it seems that the resul-
tant meaning is less predictible
(good food has certain properties concer-
ning nutritiousness and taste; a good
house is comfortable, built to last,
etc.).
As far as we can tell, the evaluation domain
for agents and instruments is precisely the acti-
vity which is relevant for the understanding of
NC&apos;s. Thus while good driver evaluates the dri-
ving, car driver specifies its object; moreover,
in good car driver, car falls within the evalua-
tion domain: car drivers and truck drivers are
evaluated on different scales. Evaluative adjec-
tives can thus be used as a further source of
evidence in the description of role nominals.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.961489" genericHeader="method">
2. Denominal Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905036363636">
Another phenomenon which is relevant to the
question of role nominals and NC&apos;s is the crea-
tion of denominal verbs. Clark &amp; Clark (1979)
examine this very productive process, in which a
verb formed by zero-affixation is understood &amp;quot;in
such a way that the parent noun denotes one role
in the situation, and the remaining surface argu-
ments of the denominal verb denote other roles in
the situation&amp;quot; (p. 787). For example, Max sub-
wayed downtown means that Max went downtown on
a subway. Intuitively, it appears obvious that
the knowledge involved in this interpretation
process is very closely related to whatever per-
mits interpreting the NC downtown subway as &amp;quot;the
subway that goes downtown&amp;quot;.
An important aspect of C &amp; C&apos;s work is to
show that the formation of denominal verbs is
heavily dependent on contextual knowledge. Thus
if you and me both know that Phil has long had
the crazy habit of sticking trombones into the
nose of bypassers, I can inform you that Phil has
just tromboned a police officer. Notice that in
the same context, good trombone would presumably
mean a trombone that is easy to stick into some-
one&apos;s nose.
In such cases, the interpretation is based
on particular, situational knowledge. NC&apos;s can
also be based on this type of knowledge. For
example, if that same Phil uses different types
of trombones for men and women, we might speak of
his women trombones, to mean trombones of the
type that Phil sticks into the nose of female
bypassers.
But C &amp; C claim that, more frequently, deno-
minal verbs are based on generic knowledge about
concrete objects, knowledge which is accessible
to all speakers in a linguistic community. This
claim is to be linked with Downing&apos;s (1977)
remark that although NC&apos;s are sometimes &amp;quot;deic-
tic&amp;quot;, they are most often based on generic or
permanent relationships.
Obviously, the relevant knowledge (whether
particular or generic) is at least as much about
the world as about language. In fact, it is clear
that both types condition each other. For exam-
ple, objects that are used as vehicles will tend
to be verbalized on the syntactic pattern of
movement verbs; and in the absence of other evi-
dence, one is likely to infer from its syntax
that The fairy pumpkined the kids to Narnia allu-
it:tartioltcpluZkig:t.ing pumpkin&amp;quot; but to a &amp;quot;trans-
In order to predict the range of meaning of
large classes of denominal verbs, C &amp; C propose
to encode some generic knowledge in the lexicon,
by means of &amp;quot;predominant features&amp;quot; such as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9981375">
(17) a. x is the agent of Act (to pilot y)
b. x is the instrument of Act (to pump y)
c. x is the result of Act (to group y)
d. x is the location of y (to can y)
e. x is the locatum of y (to cover y)
f. x is the time of Act (to weekend in y)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996585">
It is quite apparent that these features are
meant to capture the same type of facts as role
nominals. It is easy to find NC&apos;s which parallel
each class of verb singled out by them:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9573655">
(17&apos;) a. aircraft pilot
b. oil pump
c. tank group
d. oil can
e. pump cover
f. Montreal weekend
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870411764706">
We believe that the semantic mechanisms that
are at work in the interpretation of NC&apos;s, deno-
minal verbs and evaluative adjectives are basi-
cally similar. By using independent evidence from
these phenomena, and an adequate generalization
of the notion of role nominal, one can go a long
way toward uncovering the relevant semantic
mechanisms.
The notion of role nominal, as we understand
it, is at the interface between linguistic and
extralinguistic knowledge. Nouns may have several
different roles, depending on the contingencies
of the entities that they denote; in those cases
context usually makes one role more salient. In
fact, context may even impart a noun with an
unusual role, as we have seen. However, we
believe that in ordinary texts, such as technical
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993333">
512
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99396566">
manuals, NC&apos;s that are analyzable in terms of
role nominals are most often based on the usual,
generic roles of the nouns. But this can only be
shown through a large scale description of the
relevant NC&apos;s.
E. A Tentative Scheme
Since the knowledge we have to encode is
tied to world knowledge, there is a risk that it
could become overwhelmingly complex. However, we
will minimize this risk, by limiting the scope of
our inquiry to a suitably restricted sublanguage.
Technical manuals are interesting in this respect
because they exhibit at the same time a tightly
constrained universe of interpretation, and an
exceptional productivity in compounding.
As to the semantic framework, we will not
use case grammar, even if our discussion of role
nominals was couched in the terms of this theory
for expository purposes. As is well-known, case
grammars raise a number of difficult problems.
For example, the distinction between agent
and instruments is problematic. At the morpholo-
gical level, both can give rise to -er nominali-
zations; at the syntactic level, both can appear
in subject position, and in with NP environments
(cf. co-agents); and at the semantic level, both
notions are frequently undistinguishable, espe-
cially in texts dealing with machines, such as
technical manuals. Since action verbs can gene-
rally occur with an agent, an instrument, or
both, it does not seem necessary to include two
slots for each verb in the dictionary: general
rules should predict the relevant facts.
Another problem is that if we want the
notion of role nominal to be general enough, a
role nominal should be able to refer to entities
which are not case slots, at least in the usual
sense of this term. Result nominals, for instan-
ce, do not refer to a case slot as such.
such that P(x)&amp;quot;. We do not think that diacritic
markers such as &amp;quot;typical function&amp;quot; are required;
rather, notions such as typicality, should be a
consequence of the semantic rules which interpret
lexical entries.
We give below a few examples of the type of
lexical specification for role nominals with
which we want to experiment. At this stage of our
work this should be taken as nothing more than a
first approximation. The material enclosed in
brackets represents selectional restrictions.

IV CONSTRAINING INTERPRETATION RULES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875470588235">
There is in fact no evidence that the inter-
pretation rules for NC&apos;s crucially involve case
roles rather than argument places, and our de-
scriptions will be couched in terms of a predi-
cate/argument notation. This notation is perfec-
tly compatible with the use of an ontology that
is richer than standard predicate logic.
For example, if we agree with Jackendoff&apos;s
(1983) claim that &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;paths&amp;quot; constitute
basic cognitive categories, we can define &amp;quot;typed&amp;quot;
variables with the appropriate range. In our
descriptions below, 2. will denote a path varia-
ble, that is, a variable ranging over entities
denoted by complex expressions constructed out of
&amp;quot;path functions&amp;quot; (into from, toward, via, etc.)
and &amp;quot;places&amp;quot;. Similarly, we will use e as an
&amp;quot;event&amp;quot; variable, as in Moore (1981) gid Hobbs
(1984).
A role nominal will contain within its lexi-
cal entry one or more statements of the form &amp;quot;x
The preceding sections have discussed two
aspects of the lexical semantics of nouns that
are relevant for the analysis of NC&apos;s: argument-
taking nouns and role nominals. Assuming that the
lexicon contains this type of information, we can
now ask how it is used by semantic interpretation
rules.
More specifically, the picture that emerges
is that lexical entries provide predicate/argu-
ment patterns which contain variables; these
variables have to be bound to the semantic mate-
rial associated with some other noun. We must
then ask what are the rules that govern this
binding process.

Selkirk (1982) claims that the modifier noun
can satisfy an argument of the headnoun but not
vice-versa. Finin (1980) claims that argument
satisfaction (or slot filling) is possible in
both directions. Finally, McDonald (1982) takes
the intermediate position that satisfaction of
the head by a modifier is much more frequent.

In the first three (a) examples, the headnoun is
interpreted as a subject argument (agent or ins-
trument). In (288), point is interpreted as a
location (where one jacks something). In all of
the (a) examples, the action nominal is inter-
preted as denoting a permanent role or function
of the headnoun.
When order is reversed, meaning and, even-
tually, acceptability are affected. In the (b)
examples, the action nominal is not interpreted
as expressing a permanent function of the other
noun. Thus, if one can manage subject interpreta-
tions in (29h) and (31c) -- &amp;quot;a repair done by men
(not robots)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a valve which bleeds some-
thing&amp;quot; --, it will not follow that the men are
repair men or that the valve is a bleed valve.
The pattern &amp;quot;argument + predicative noun&amp;quot;
has some pecularities of its own; for example,
why is (32h) unacceptable no matter the role
assignment that one makes? Or why is swim-
ming unacceptable? In the latter case, it cannot
be, as suggested by Selkirk (1982) that subject
arguments are prohibited in general: pump failure
is fine. It may be that subjects are ruled out
for -ing nominals, unless they express a result
(cf. consumer spending).
But on the whole, the pattern where the
predicate comes first is much more constrained,
since it permits only action nominals, and pro-
duces a semantic result very similar to role
nominals. Thus, a cooling device and cooler
denote very similar entities; the same is true of
jacking system and jack. Notice that in examples
such as:
(33) air temperature monitoring system
monitoring system forms a constituent, even if
air temperature is understood as the object of
of the monitoring; this is confirmed by the fact
that (34) receives a similar interpretation:
(34) monitoring system for air temperature
It seems that this modification pattern has the
effect of creating a role nominal out of its two
constituents.

In the (a) examples, the modifier noun is inter-
preted as the object of the underlying verb
(drive, transfer, detect, hold); here too, a
permanent connection is established. A truck
driver is a person whose (social) function is to
drive trucks, and that person is still a truck
driver when he/she drives a scooter. If you use
an oil pump to pump your tomato juice, it still
qualifies to be called an oil pump.
But when the nouns are inverted, there is a
change in meaning and, possibly, in acceptabili-
ty. It is hard to find a sensible interpretation
for driver truck. The most natural interpretation
for pump oil is &amp;quot;oil used for lubricating pumps&amp;quot;:
in this case, oil has become the relevant role
nominal. There is also a possibility for an
interpretation such as &amp;quot;oil in the pump&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oil
coming from the pump&amp;quot;. We are not sure how that
type of interpretation should be produced. But it
seems clear that oil can only become an actor in

a permanent function of the pump when pump is the
headnoun.
It is easy to see that the other examples
exhibit a similar behavior. We therefore conclude
that role nominals tend to establish permanent,
functional connections with their modifiers only.
When they modify a headnoun, either this noun
will absorb them itself (if it is a predicative
or role nominal) or else a looser connection such
as a locative one will be created.

<bodyText confidence="0.974827451612903">
So far, we have concentrated on predicative
nouns and role nominals, thereby excluding
various types of compounds. When we look at the
broader picture, different problems are raised.
First, (in technical manuals) we find examples
with intervening adjectives as in (43):
(43) (Remove) front cockpit right shelf aft con-
trol panel.
While the formation of NC&apos;s such as those we
have examined in previous sections is usually
considered to be a lexical process, there is some
evidence that, in examples like (43), syntactic
processes are at work. Notice that each one of
the three main groups in (43) is referential:
&amp;quot;the (...) panel of the (...) shelf of the (...)
cockpit&amp;quot;, much as if there was an implicit geni-
tive marker. But genuine compounds (that is,
those of syntactic category N) are usually consi-
dered to be anaphoric islands (Levi, 1978). One
possible explanation is that (43) should in fact
be analyzed as containing three NP&apos;s.
A comparison of the following examples pro-
vides some support for that view:
(44) a. Remove front cockpit right shelf.
b. Remove right cockpit shelf.
In (44a), cockpit has definite reference and is
interpreted as no more than a location for the
shelf. However, in (44b), when the scope of right
includes shelf, cockpit becomes nonreferential;
cockpit shelf then denotes a type of shelf. These
facts seem to indicate that this scoping of
right, in virtue of syntactic constraints, forces
one to take cockpit shelf as something of cate-
gory N; and when we do so, shelf becomes a role
nominal whose argument receives the type of &amp;quot;per-
manent function&amp;quot; interpretation discussed above.
Core NC&apos;s, those which establish argument
connections with a predicative noun or role
nominal, appear to form a tightly bound unit:
(45) a. ??oil high temperature
b. ??truck good driver
c. ??equipment left bay
Some adjectives, the &amp;quot;nonpredicating&amp;quot; adjectives
of Levi (1978) can appear within core NC&apos;s. But
they are in fact nouns in disguise, and they
receive an argument interpretation; in (46), it
is understood that one repairs a structure.
(46) aircraft structural repairs
Thus, if we are willing to make a distinc-
tion between syntactic compounding (similar to
genitive phrases) and core NC&apos;s, it can be
claimed that true compounds form anaphoric
islands and cannot be separated by adjectives.
Finally, there are certain types of nominal
modifiers (for which we have as yet no analysis
to offer) whose degree of cohesion with the
headnoun is somehow intermediate between nouns
interpreted as arguments and nouns in separate
(pseudo-genitive) NP&apos;s. For example, nouns which
stand in a &amp;quot;material of&amp;quot; relation to the head
cannot precede adjectives, but must precede argu-
ments:

(43) a. large steel tank
b. ??steel large tank
(44) a. steel fuel tank
b. ??fuel steel tank

<bodyText confidence="0.9999282">
The constraints that we have seen, and no
doubt others yet to be discovered, are certainly
significant from a theoretical point of view; but
they also have practical value for NLP systems
which have to deal with NC&apos;s.

VI CONCLUSIONS

<bodyText confidence="0.999958875">
We have discussed two classes of nouns that
have particular importance in NC formation: pre-
dicative nouns and role nominals. We have shown
that the latter class is also relevant to the
description of evaluative adjectives and denomi-
nal verbs. A tentative framework for the descrip-
tion of role nominals has then been proposed.
Finally, we have seen that rules which interpret

bound unit with internal ordering constraints. mantique, in T.A. Informations, 11:2, 1971.
Much work remains to be done on the issues
that we have discussed here; it is likely that
experimentation with actual descriptions on a
larger scale will lead to several refinements and
revisions. Moreover, as has been pointed out in
the last section, our description still ignores a
number of types of compounding, and further dif-
ficulties are to be expected. Nonetheless, we are
confident that our work will, in the near future,
result in a small NLP system capable of analyzing
a broad range of NC&apos;s.

Thus while good driver evaluates the driving, car driver specifies its object; moreover, in good car driver, car falls within the evaluation domain: car drivers and truck drivers are evaluated on different scales. Evaluative adjectives can thus be used as a further source of evidence in the description of role nominals. 2. Denominal Verbs Another phenomenon which is relevant to the question of role nominals and NC&apos;s is the creation of denominal verbs. Clark &amp; Clark (1979) examine this very productive process, in which a verb formed by zero-affixation is understood &amp;quot;in such a way that the parent noun denotes one role in the situation, and the remaining surface arguments of the denominal verb denote other roles in the situation&amp;quot; (p. 787). For example, Max subwayed downtown means that Max went downtown on a subway. Intuitively, it appears obvious that the knowledge involved in this interpretation process is very closely related to whatever permits interpreting the NC downtown subway as &amp;quot;the subway that goes downtown&amp;quot;.

In a number of more recent studies, such as Levi (1978), there has been an attempt to view NC&apos;s as governed by tight semantic constraints. Thus, according to Levi, any novel NC realizes a pattern where either: a) the head noun is a deverbal nominalization and its modifier is interpreted as an argument of the related verb; or b) the two nouns are related by one of exactly nine deletable predicates (&amp;quot;is the cause of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;is for&amp;quot;, etc.). This reductionist attempt has been criticized, most notably by Downing (1977), on the 509 grounds that the interpretation of NC&apos;s crucially involves pragmatic knowledge, and that numerous cases of NC&apos;s (such as thalidomide parents) will resist any analysis in terms of a closed set of relations. These criticisms have led theorists like Selkirk (1982) to adopt the position that only &amp;quot;verbal compounds&amp;quot; (those constructed on a pattern &amp;quot;argument + nominalization&amp;quot;) are amenable to linguistic characterization; all other NC&apos;s would have to be explained in separate extralinguistic theories.

Thus, definition (b) seems the most appropriate. D. Justifying, Role Assignments For those role nominals where there is no morphological evidence of relatedness with the underlying verb, one is forced to rely mostly on intuitions. However, the risk of arbitrariness can be reduced by looking for further evidence from other linguistic phenomena. 511 1. Evaluative Adjectives When Fillmore (1971) introduced his notion of role nominal, he was attempting to characterize the behavior of evaluative adjectives, not the behavior of NC&apos;s. He noted that a .22od X, where X is a role nominal, means: a. if X is an agent: one who performs the associated activity skilfully (a good driver, a good pianist); b. if X is an instrument: a thing which permits the associated activity to be performed easily (a good knife, a good broom); c. In other cases, it seems that the resultant meaning is less predictible (good food has certain properties concerning nutritiousness and taste; a good house is comfortabl</context>

In both systems, the individual nouns of an NC are first mapped onto conceptual representations where concepts are characterized by a set of &amp;quot;roles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot;, and are arranged in an abstraction hierarchy. Interpreting a compound then amounts to forming a derived concept on the basis of the constituent concepts; in most cases, this is done by interpreting one of the concepts as a slot filler for the other.

Root Nouns The term &amp;quot;role nominal&amp;quot; is due to Finin (1980) who uses it to cover not only nominalizations of the type described above, but also any noun which can be semantically interpreted as referring to a role of a given verb, whether or not this verb happens to be morphologically related.

Assuming that the lexicon contains this type of information, we can now ask how it is used by semantic interpretation rules. More specifically, the picture that emerges is that lexical entries provide predicate/argument patterns which contain variables; these variables have to be bound to the semantic material associated with some other noun. We must then ask what are the rules that govern this binding process. 513 A. Relative Order of the two Nouns 1. Predicative Nouns Selkirk (1982) claims that the modifier noun can satisfy an argument of the headnoun but not vice-versa. Finin (1980) claims that argument satisfaction (or slot filling) is possible in both directions. Finally, McDonald (1982) takes the intermediate position that satisfaction of the head by a modifier is much more frequent. Now, consider the following pairs of examples: (25) a. oil temperature b. ??temperature oil (26) a. uranium scarcity b. ??scarcity uranium (27) a. pump removal b. ??removal pump (28) a. student invention b. ??invention student It is clear that the (b) examples, if interpretable at all, cannot easily realize the pattern found in the (a) examples.

And since noun meaning appears to be closely connected with knowledge of the world, one is led to explore the modes of interaction between linguistic and conceptual knowledge. From an NLP perspective, NC&apos;s have turned out to be an important stumbling block for systems that attempt to deal with real-life text, especially in technical domains, for purposes such as machine translation (Isabelle, to appear), information retrieval, etc. Our ultimate goal is to develop an NLP system capable of analyzing large classes of NC&apos;s in the sublanguage (Kittredge and Lehrberger, 1982) of aircraft maintenance manuals. We do not aim at solving all cases, since we believe the problem to be exceedingly difficult. At the present stage of our inquiry, we concentrate on the design of a suitable theoretical framework. In section II, we present a brief review of previous work in linguistics and NLP. In sections III and IV, we examine two aspects of the semantics of nouns that are crucially relevant to the analysis of NC&apos;s: predicative nouns and role nominals. Finally, in section V, we explore possible constraints on the semantic interpretation of NC&apos;s. II BACKGROUND A. Approaches i</context>

At the present stage of our inquiry, we concentrate on the design of a suitable theoretical framework. In section II, we present a brief review of previous work in linguistics and NLP. In sections III and IV, we examine two aspects of the semantics of nouns that are crucially relevant to the analysis of NC&apos;s: predicative nouns and role nominals. Finally, in section V, we explore possible constraints on the semantic interpretation of NC&apos;s. II BACKGROUND A. Approaches in Linguistics The early study of Lees (1963) classified NC&apos;s on purely grammatical criteria, and it failed to provide constraints that could explain how NC&apos;s are semantically interpreted. In a number of more recent studies, such as Levi (1978), there has been an attempt to view NC&apos;s as governed by tight semantic constraints. Thus, according to Levi, any novel NC realizes a pattern where either: a) the head noun is a deverbal nominalization and its modifier is interpreted as an argument of the related verb; or b) the two nouns are related by one of exactly nine deletable predicates (&amp;quot;is the cause of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;is for&amp;quot;, etc.).

This reductionist attempt has been criticized, most notably by Downing (1977), on the 509 grounds that the interpretation of NC&apos;s crucially involves pragmatic knowledge, and that numerous cases of NC&apos;s (such as thalido</context>

While the formation of NC&apos;s such as those we have examined in previous sections is usually considered to be a lexical process, there is some evidence that, in examples like (43), syntactic processes are at work. Notice that each one of the three main groups in (43) is referential: &amp;quot;the (...) panel of the (...) shelf of the (...) cockpit&amp;quot;, much as if there was an implicit genitive marker. But genuine compounds (that is, those of syntactic category N) are usually considered to be anaphoric islands (Levi, 1978). One possible explanation is that (43) should in fact be analyzed as containing three NP&apos;s. A comparison of the following examples provides some support for that view: (44) a. Remove front cockpit right shelf. b. Remove right cockpit shelf. In (44a), cockpit has definite reference and is interpreted as no more than a location for the shelf. However, in (44b), when the scope of right includes shelf, cockpit becomes nonreferential; cockpit shelf then denotes a type of shelf. These facts seem to indicate that this scoping of right, in virtue of syntactic constraints, forces one to take cockpit s</context>

These criticisms have led theorists like Selkirk (1982) to adopt the position that only &amp;quot;verbal compounds&amp;quot; (those constructed on a pattern &amp;quot;argument + nominalization&amp;quot;) are amenable to linguistic characterization; all other NC&apos;s would have to be explained in separate extralinguistic theories. C. Approaches in NLP Several systems have been developed in an NLP framework to deal with the problem of interpreting NC&apos;s; two recent examples are reported in Finin (1980) and McDonald (1982). In both systems, the individual nouns of an NC are first mapped onto conceptual representations where concepts are characterized by a set of &amp;quot;roles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot;, and are arranged in an abstraction hierarchy. Interpreting a compound then amounts to forming a derived concept on the basis of the constituent concepts; in most cases, this is done by interpreting one of the concepts as a slot filler for the other. For example, the interpretation of steel adapter would involve inserting the concept associated with steel into a RAW-MATERIAL slot within the representation of adapter. But the authors d</context>

More specifically, the picture that emerges is that lexical entries provide predicate/argument patterns which contain variables; these variables have to be bound to the semantic material associated with some other noun. We must then ask what are the rules that govern this binding process. 513 A. Relative Order of the two Nouns 1. Predicative Nouns Selkirk (1982) claims that the modifier noun can satisfy an argument of the headnoun but not vice-versa. Finin (1980) claims that argument satisfaction (or slot filling) is possible in both directions. Finally, McDonald (1982) takes the intermediate position that satisfaction of the head by a modifier is much more frequent. Now, consider the following pairs of examples: (25) a. oil temperature b. ??temperature oil (26) a. uranium scarcity b. ??scarcity uranium (27) a. pump removal b. ??removal pump (28) a. student invention b. ??invention student It is clear that the (b) examples, if interpretable at all, cannot easily realize the pattern found in the (a) examples. However, there is a very productive process which permits an action nominal to occur to the left of its argument; this pattern is most productive with i</context>

This notation is perfectly compatible with the use of an ontology that is richer than standard predicate logic. For example, if we agree with Jackendoff&apos;s (1983) claim that &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;paths&amp;quot; constitute basic cognitive categories, we can define &amp;quot;typed&amp;quot; variables with the appropriate range. In our descriptions below, 2. will denote a path variable, that is, a variable ranging over entities denoted by complex expressions constructed out of &amp;quot;path functions&amp;quot; (into from, toward, via, etc.) and &amp;quot;places&amp;quot;.
