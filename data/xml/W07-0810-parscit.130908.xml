Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999909818181819">
Sentence alignment consists in estimating
which sentence or sentences in the source
language correspond with which sentence
or sentences in a target language. We pre-
sent in this paper a new approach to align-
ing sentences from a parallel corpus based
on a cross-language information retrieval
system. This approach consists in building
a database of sentences of the target text
and considering each sentence of the
source text as a &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; to that database.
The cross-language information retrieval
system is a weighted Boolean search en-
gine based on a deep linguistic analysis of
the query and the documents to be indexed.
This system is composed of a multilingual
linguistic analyzer, a statistical analyzer, a
reformulator, a comparator and a search
engine. The multilingual linguistic analyzer
includes a morphological analyzer, a part-
of-speech tagger and a syntactic analyzer.
The linguistic analyzer processes both
documents to be indexed and queries to
produce a set of normalized lemmas, a set
of named entities and a set of nominal
compounds with their morpho-syntactic
tags. The statistical analyzer computes for
documents to be indexed concept weights
based on concept database frequencies. The
comparator computes intersections between
queries and documents and provides a rele-
vance weight for each intersection. Before
this comparison, the reformulator expands
queries during the search. The expansion is
used to infer from the original query words
other words expressing the same concepts.
The search engine retrieves the ranked,
relevant documents from the indexes ac-
cording to the corresponding reformulated
query and then merges the results obtained
for each language, taking into account the
original words of the query and their
weights in order to score the documents.
The sentence aligner has been evaluated on
the MD corpus of the ARCADE II project
which is composed of news articles from
the French newspaper &amp;quot;Le Monde Diplo-
matique&amp;quot;. The part of the corpus used in
evaluation consists of the same subset of
sentences in Arabic and French. Arabic
sentences are aligned to their French coun-
terparts. Results showed that alignment has
correct precision and recall even when the
corpus is not completely parallel (changes
in sentence order or missing sentences).

Sentence alignment consists in mapping sentences
of the source language with their translations in the
target language. Automatic sentence alignment
approaches face two kinds of difficulties: robust-
ness and accuracy. A number of automatic sen-
tence alignment techniques have been proposed
(Kay and Röscheisen, 1993; Gale and Church,

<bodyText confidence="0.998965944444444">
The method proposed in (Kay and Röscheisen,
1993) is based on the assumption that in order for
the sentences in a translation to correspond, the
words in them must correspond. In other words, all
necessary information (and in particular, lexical
mapping) is derived from the to-be-aligned texts
themselves.
In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al.,
1991), the authors start from the fact that the length
of a source text sentence is highly correlated with
the length of its target text translation: short sen-
tences tend to have short translations, and long
sentences tend to have long translations.
The method proposed in (Debili and Sammouda,
1992) is based on the preliminary alignment of
words using a conventional bilingual lexicon and
the method described in (Papageorgiou et al., 1994)
added grammatical labeling based on the assump-
tion that the same parts of speech tend to be em-
ployed in the translation.
In this paper, we present a sentence aligner
which is based on a cross-language information
retrieval approach and combines different informa-
tion sources (bilingual lexicon, sentence length and
sentence position). This sentence aligner was first
developed for aligning French-English parallel text.
It is now ported to Arabic-French and Arabic-
English language pairs.
We present in section 2 the main components of
the cross-language search engine, in particular, we
will focus on the linguistic processing. In section 3,
the prototype of our sentence aligner is described.
We discuss in section 4 results obtained after align-
ing sentences of the MD (Monde Diplomatique)
corpus of the ARCADE II project. Section 5 con-
cludes our study and presents our future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.999126466666667">
Information retrieval consists to find all relevant
documents for a user query in a collection of
documents. These documents are ordered by the
probability of being relevant to the user&apos;s query.
The highest ranked document is considered to be
the most likely relevant document. Cross-language
information retrieval consists in providing a query
in one language and searching documents in
different languages (Grefenstette, 1998). The
cross-lingual search engine is a weighted Boolean
search engine based on a deep linguistic analysis of
the query and the documents to be indexed
(Besançon et al., 2003). It is composed of a
linguistic analyzer, a statistical analyzer, a
reformulator and a comparator (Figure 1):

<bodyText confidence="0.999468">
The linguistic analyzer produces a set of normal-
ized lemmas, a set of named entities and a set of
nominal compounds. It is composed of several lin-
guistic resources and processing modules.
Each language has its proper linguistic resources
which are generally composed of:

and linguistic features (gender, number, etc).
For languages such as Arabic which pre-
sents agglutination of articles, prepositions
and conjunctions at the beginning of the
word as well as pronouns at the ending of
the word, we added two other dictionaries
for proclitics and enclitics in order to split
the input words into proclitics, simple forms
and enclitics.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957390111111111">
• A monolingual reformulation dictionary
used in query expansion for expanding
original query words to other words express-
ing the same concepts (synonyms, hypo-
nyms, etc.).
• Bilingual dictionaries used in cross-
language querying.
• A set of rules for tokenizing words.
• A set of part-of-speech n-grams (bigrams
and trigrams from hand-tagged corpora) that
are used for part-of-speech tagging.
• A set of rules for shallow parsing of sen-
tences, extracting compounds from the input
text.
• A set of rules for the identification of
named entities: gazetteers and contextual
rules that use special triggers to identify
named entities and their type.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998604">
The processing modules are common for all the
languages with some variations for some specific
languages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964616">
• A Tokenizer which separates the input
stream into a graph of words. This separa-
tion is achieved by an automaton devel-
oped for each language and a set of seg-
mentation rules.
• A Morphological analyzer which searches
each word in a general dictionary (Debili
and Zouari, 1985). If this word is found, it
will be associated with its lemma and all
its morpho-syntactic tags. If the word is
not found in the general dictionary, it is

<bodyText confidence="0.973090238095238">
given a default set of morpho-syntactic
tags based on its typography. For Arabic,
we added to the morphological analyzer a
new processing step: a Clitic stemmer
(Larkey et al., 2002) which splits aggluti-
nated words into proclitics, simple forms
and enclitics. If the simple form computed
by the clitic stemmer does not exist in the
general dictionary, re-write rules are ap-
plied (Darwish, 2002). For example, con-
sider the token “,~=+rt+” (with their ballon)
and the included clitics “~” (with) and “~~”
(their), the computed simple form “ ~
”
does not exist in the general dictionary but
after applying one of the dozen re-write
rules, the modified simple form “~~
”
(ballon) is found in the general dictionary
and the input token is segmented as:
������� = � + ���� + ��.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.599880210526316">
• An Idiomatic Expressions recognizer
which detects idiomatic expressions and
considers them as single words for the rest
of the processing. Idiomatic expressions
are phrases or compound nouns that are
listed in a specific dictionary. The detec-
tion of idiomatic expressions is performed
by applying a set of rules that are triggered
on specific words and tested on left and
right contexts of the trigger. These rules
can recognize contiguous expressions as
the &amp;quot;white house&amp;quot; in English, la &amp;quot;maison
blanche&amp;quot; in French or &amp;quot;,&gt;4VI x+11&amp;quot; in Ara-
bic. Non-contiguous expressions such as
phrasal verbs in English: &amp;quot;switch...on&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;tomber vaguement dans les pommes&amp;quot; in
French are recognized too.
• A Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger which
searches valid paths through all the possi-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.939947538461539">
ble tags paths using attested trigrams and
bigrams sequences. The trigram and bi-
gram matrices are generated from a manu-
ally annotated training corpus (Grefen-
stette et al., 2005). They are extracted from
a hand-tagged corpora of 13 200 words for
Arabic and 25 000 words for French. If no
continuous trigram full path is found, the
POS tagger tries to use bigrams at the
points where the trigrams were not found
in the matrix. The accuracy of the part-of-
speech tagger is around 91% for Arabic
and 94% for French.

<listItem confidence="0.576995">
• A Syntactic analyzer which is used to split
word graph into nominal and verbal chain
and recognize dependency relations (espe-
cially those within compounds) by using a
set of syntactic rules. We developed a set
of dependency relations to link nouns to
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.993472">

<bodyText confidence="0.999556363636364">
other nouns, a noun with a proper noun, a
proper noun with the post nominal adjec-
tive and a noun with a post nominal adjec-
tive. These relations are restricted to the
same nominal chain and are used to com-
pute compound words. For example, in the
nominal chain “������ �ی���” (water supply),
the syntactic analyzer considers this nomi-
nal chain as a compound word ( ���ﻡ� �ی��� )
composed of the words “�ی���” (supply)
and “���ﻡ” (water).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.940629466666667">
• A Named Entity recognizer which uses
name triggers (e.g., President, lake, corpo-
ration, etc.) to identify named entities
(Abuleil and Evens, 2004). For example,
the expression “ !��ﻡ &amp;quot;�4­# $&amp;quot;ﻡ %&amp;&apos;VV” (The first
of March) is recognized as a date and the
expression “(:411 *��&amp;+��” (The Middle East)
is recognized as a location.
• Eliminating Empty Words consists in iden-
tifying words that should not be used as
search criteria and eliminating them. These
empty words are identified using only their
parts of speech (such as prepositions, arti-
cles, punctuations and some adverbs).
• Finally, words are normalized by their

lemma. In the case the word has a set of
synonymous lemmas, only one of these
lemmas is taken as a normalization. Each
normalized word is associated with its
morpho-syntactic tag.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999081">
2.2 Statistical Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997265047619048">
The role of the statistical analysis is to attribute
a weight to each word or a compound word ac-
cording to the information the word or the com-
pound word provides in choosing the document
relevant to a query. This weight is computed by an
idf formula (Salton and McGill, 1983). The weight
is maximum for words appearing in one single
document and minimum for words appearing in all
the documents. This weight is used by the com-
parator to compute the semantic intersection be-
tween query and documents containing different
words. A similarity value is associated with each
semantic intersection. This value corresponds to
the sum of the weights of words present in the
documents. The search engine groups documents
into classes (semantic intersections) characterized
by the same set of words. These classes constitute
a discrete partition of the indexed documents. For
example, the search engine returns 12 classes for
the query “e144II ,!I-.,ﻡ s!~,-” (water resources man-
agement) (Table 1).

2.3 Query Reformulation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985666666667">
The role of query reformulation is to infer new
words from the original query words according to a
lexical semantic knowledge. The reformulation can
be used to increase the quality of the retrieval in a
monolingual interrogation. It can also be used to
infer words in other languages. The query terms
are translated using bilingual dictionaries. Each
term of the query is translated into several terms in
target language. The translated words form the
search terms of the reformulated query. The links
between the search terms and the query concepts
can also be weighted by a confidence value indi-
cating the relevance of the translation. Reformula-
tion rules can be applied to all instances of a word
or to a word only when it is playing a specific part-
of-speech. Semantic relations can also be selected:
translations, synonyms, word derived from the
same root, etc. The cross-language search engine
has a monolingual reformulation for French and
two bilingual reformulations for Arabic-French
and French-Arabic language pairs.

2.4 Query and Documents Comparison
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999678">
The search engine indexer builds the inverted files
of the documents on the basis of their linguistic
analysis: one index is built for each language of the
document collection. This indexer builds separate
indexes for each language. The search engine uses
a comparison tool to evaluate all possible intersec-
tions between query words and documents, and
computes a relevance weight for each intersection.
This relevance weight corresponds to the sum of
the weights of words present in the documents.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997594">
Parallel text alignment based on cross-language
information retrieval consists in building a data-
base of sentences of the target text and considering
each sentence of the source text as a &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; to that
database (Figure 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.99951">
To evaluate whether the two sentences are trans-
lations of each other, we use three criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978660222222222">
• Number of common words between the
source sentence and the target sentence
(semantic intersection) must be higher than
50% of number of words of the target sen-
tence.
• Position of the sentence to align must be in
an interval of 10 compared to the position
of the last aligned sentence.
• Ratio of lengths of the target sentence and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.954939">
the source sentence (in characters) must be
higher or equal than 1.1 (A French charac-
ter needs 1.1 Arabic characters): Longer
sentences in Arabic tend to be translated
into longer sentences in French, and
shorter sentences tend to be translated into
shorter sentences.
The alignment process has four steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8265251">
1. Exact match 1-1 alignment: The goal of
this step is to obtain an alignment with a
maximum precision by using the three cri-
teria: Number of common words between
the source sentence and the target sen-
tence; Position of the sentence to align;
Ratio of lengths of the target sentence and
the source sentence.
2. 1-2 alignment: This alignment consists in
merging an unaligned sentence with one

<bodyText confidence="0.890450315789474">

sentence. We use to validate this alignment
only the first two criteria.
3. 2-1 alignment: The goal of this alignment
is to find for the two sentences following
an aligned sentence a sentence in the target
language taking into account the position
of the last aligned sentence. This align-
ment is validated by using only the first
two criteria.
4. Fuzzy match 1-1 alignment: This align-
ment proposes for the sentence to align
the first sentence of the first class returned
by the cross-language search engine. This
type of alignment is added to take into ac-
count alignments which are partially cor-
rect (The source sentence is not completely
aligned but some of its words are trans-
lated).

The first proposed sentence is the original one
and more of 50% of the words are common to the
two sentences. Furthermore, the length ratio be-
tween the French sentence and the Arabic sentence
is superior than 1.1 and positions of these two sen-
tences in the databases are the same. Therefore, the
exact match 1-1 aligner considers the French sen-

[4/30].

4 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99727735">
The sentence aligner has been tested on the MD
corpus of the ARCADE II project which is com-
posed of news articles from the French newspaper
&amp;quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&amp;quot; (Chiao et al., 2006).
This corpus contains 5 Arabic texts (244 sentences)
aligned at the sentence level to 5 French texts (283
sentences). The test consisted to build two data-
bases of sentences (Arabic and French) and to con-
sider each Arabic sentence as a &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; to the
French database.
To evaluate the sentence aligner, we used the
following measures:
A corresponds to the set of alignments provided
by the sentence aligner and Ar corresponds to the
set of the correct alignments.
The results we obtained at sentence level (Table
4) show an average precision around 97% and an
average recall around 93%. These results do not
take into account alignments which are partially
correct (Fuzzy match 1-1 alignment).

Analysis of these results shows that our sentence
aligner is not sensitive to missing sentences. This
is because the first criterion used by our aligner is
not related to surface information (sentence posi-
tion or sentence length) but on the semantic inter-
section of these sentences.
Moreover, we have noted that precision depends
on the discriminate terms which can occur in the
source and target sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.999916785714286">
We have proposed a new approach to sentence
alignment based on a cross-language information
retrieval model combining different information
sources (bilingual lexicon, sentence length and
sentence position). The results we obtained show
correct precision and recall even when the parallel
corpus includes changes in sentence order and
missing sentences. This is due to the non-
sequential strategy used by the sentence aligner. In
future work, we plan to improve the alignment
with syntactic structures of source and target sen-
tences and to use the aligned bilingual parallel cor-
pus as a translation memory in a computer-aided
translation tool.

<abstract confidence="0.999705357142857">Sentence alignment consists in estimating which sentence or sentences in the source language correspond with which sentence or sentences in a target language. We present in this paper a new approach to aligning sentences from a parallel corpus based on a cross-language information retrieval system. This approach consists in building a database of sentences of the target text and considering each sentence of the source text as a &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; to that database. The cross-language information retrieval system is a weighted Boolean search engine based on a deep linguistic analysis of the query and the documents to be indexed. This system is composed of a multilingual linguistic analyzer, a statistical analyzer, a reformulator, a comparator and a search engine. The multilingual linguistic analyzer includes a morphological analyzer, a partof-speech tagger and a syntactic analyzer. The linguistic analyzer processes both documents to be indexed and queries to produce a set of normalized lemmas, a set of named entities and a set of nominal compounds with their morpho-syntactic tags. The statistical analyzer computes for documents to be indexed concept weights based on concept database frequencies. The comparator computes intersections between queries and documents and provides a relevance weight for each intersection. Before this comparison, the reformulator expands queries during the search. The expansion is used to infer from the original query words other words expressing the same concepts. The search engine retrieves the ranked, relevant documents from the indexes according to the corresponding reformulated query and then merges the results obtained for each language, taking into account the original words of the query and their weights in order to score the documents. The sentence aligner has been evaluated on the MD corpus of the ARCADE II project which is composed of news articles from the French newspaper &amp;quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&amp;quot;. The part of the corpus used in evaluation consists of the same subset of sentences in Arabic and French. Arabic sentences are aligned to their French counterparts. Results showed that alignment has correct precision and recall even when the corpus is not completely parallel (changes in sentence order or missing sentences).</abstract>

In other words, all necessary information (and in particular, lexical mapping) is derived from the to-be-aligned texts themselves. In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al., 1991), the authors start from the fact that </context>

These rules can recognize contiguous expressions as the &amp;quot;white house&amp;quot; in English, la &amp;quot;maison blanche&amp;quot; in French or &amp;quot;,&gt;4VI x+11&amp;quot; in Arabic. Non-contiguous expressions such as phrasal verbs in English: &amp;quot;switch...on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tomber vaguement dans les pommes&amp;quot; in French are recognized too. • A Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger which searches valid paths through all the possible tags paths using attested trigrams and bigrams sequences. The trigram and bigram matrices are generated from a manually annotated training corpus (Grefenstette et al., 2005). They are extracted from a hand-tagged corpora of 13 200 words for Arabic and 25 000 words for French. If no continuous trigram full path is found, the POS tagger tries to use bigrams at the points where the trigrams were not found in the matrix. The accuracy of the part-ofspeech tagger is around 91% for Arabic and 94% for French. • A Syntactic analyzer which is used to split word graph into nominal and verbal chain and recognize dependency relations (especially those within compounds) by using a set of syntactic rules.

This separation is achieved by an automaton developed for each language and a set of segmentation rules. • A Morphological analyzer which searches each word in a general dictionary (Debili and Zouari, 1985). If this word is found, it will be associated with its lemma and all its morpho-syntactic tags. If the word is not found in the general dictionary, it is given a default set of morpho-syntactic tags based on its typography. For Arabic, we added to the morphological analyzer a new processing step: a Clitic stemmer (Larkey et al., 2002) which splits agglutinated words into proclitics, simple forms and enclitics. If the simple form computed by the clitic stemmer does not exist in the general dictionary, re-write rules are applied (Darwish, 2002). For example, consider the token “,~=+rt+” (with their ballon) and the included clitics “~” (with) and “~~” (their), the computed simple form “ ~ ” does not exist in the general dictionary but after applying one of the dozen re-write rules, the modified simple form “~~ ” (ballon) is found in the general dictionary and the input token is segmented as: ������� = � + ���� + ��. • An Idio</context>

In the case the word has a set of synonymous lemmas, only one of these lemmas is taken as a normalization. Each normalized word is associated with its morpho-syntactic tag. 2.2 Statistical Analysis The role of the statistical analysis is to attribute a weight to each word or a compound word according to the information the word or the compound word provides in choosing the document relevant to a query. This weight is computed by an idf formula (Salton and McGill, 1983). The weight is maximum for words appearing in one single document and minimum for words appearing in all the documents. This weight is used by the comparator to compute the semantic intersection between query and documents containing different words. A similarity value is associated with each semantic intersection. This value corresponds to the sum of the weights of words present in the documents. The search engine groups documents into classes (semantic intersections) characterized by the same set of words. These classes constitute a discrete partition of the indexed documents. For example, </context>
