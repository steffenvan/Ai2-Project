Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997610625">
This paper describes sociological
fieldwork conducted in the autumn of
2008 in eleven rural communities of South
Africa. The goal of the fieldwork was to
evaluate the potential role of automated
telephony services in improving access to
important government information and
services. Our interviews, focus group
discussions and surveys revealed that
Lwazi, a telephone-based spoken dialog
system, could greatly support current
South African government efforts to
effectively connect citizens to available
services, provided such services be toll
free, in local languages, and with content
relevant to each community.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960065573771">
There is a growing interest in deploying spoken
dialog systems (SDSs) in developing regions. In
rural communities of developing regions, where
infrastructure, distances, language and literacy
are barriers to access, but where mobile phones
are prevalent, an SDS could be key to unlocking
social and economic growth (Barnard et al.,
2003). Some notable recent studies in this field
include “Tamil Market” (Plauché et al., 2006)
and “VoiKiosk” (Agarwal et al., 2008). Both
were kiosk-based SDSs providing agricultural
information that were tested in rural, semi-
literate communities in India. Nasfors (2007)
also developed an agricultural information
service, aimed at mobile telephone users in
Kenya. “Healthline” was evaluated by a small
set of community health workers in Pakistan
(Sherwani et al., 2007), who had trouble with the
voice-based interface, presumably due to their
limited literacy. In a more recent study, Sharma
et al. (2008) evaluated a SDS designed for
caregivers of HIV positive children in Botswana.
The researchers found that the users performed
equally well using touchtone as speech input,
when navigating the system. In the current paper,
we expand on this body of work by investigating
the potential role for SDSs in connecting rural
citizens of South Africa with government
services, such as free education opportunities and
stipends.
South Africa is the leader in Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) in Africa
and has the most developed telecommunications
network on the continent (SA year book
2006/2007: 131). In particular, mobile phone
usage has experienced massive growth due in
part to its accessibility by non-literate people and
its “leapfrog” development, which skipped the
interim solutions adopted in the developed world
(Tongia &amp; Subrahmanian, 2006). The amount of
mobile phone users in South Africa is an
astonishing 30 million people - out of a total
population of 47 million (Benjamin, 2007). The
percentage of both rural and urban households
with mobile phones tripled from 2001 to 2007,
while “landline” use declined. The accessibility
and widespread use of mobile phones make
SDSs a good candidate for low-cost information
access.
In South Africa, there are eleven official
languages. Private companies, NGOs and
government offices who wish to reach South
Africans through print or audio, find it extremely
costly to do so for each language. Heugh (2007)
shows that in terms of speakers&apos; proficiency,
there is no single lingua franca for South
Africans (see Figure 1). In fact, in 2001, only 3
million of 44 million South Africans were
English speakers, the language in which most
government messages are currently disseminated
(Household survey 2001).

Heugh (2007) reports that between 35% and
45% of South Africans above the age of 16
cannot read or write. Illiteracy is
disproportionately high for women and for
people living in the primarily rural provinces:
KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.
Mobile phone use is widespread in these areas
among semi-literate citizens and speakers of all
languages.
Communities in rural areas struggle to access
government services due to their remote
locations. Most community members must travel
long distances by foot or rare and costly public
transport to access basic services. In their
longitudinal household study on costs and
coping strategies with chronic illnesses, Goudge
et al. (2007), for example, found that people in
rural areas of South Africa do not go to free
health care facilities because they cannot afford
transport.
NGOs face the same challenge when trying to
reach rural populations. Many produce
information to assist households affected by
HIV/AIDS, for example, but most of the
materials are published on websites; the cost of
providing multilingual print materials is often
too high. Due to low literacy levels, language,
and a lack of infrastructure, the information
remains inaccessible to the people who need it,
especially those living in rural areas and
townships (Benjamin, 2007).
Given the well developed mobile phone
network and the relatively sparse alternative
options in rural South Africa, the authors believe
that multilingual SDSs can provide a low-cost
solution to improving the ICT access of citizens
who may currently be excluded from
government services due to language, literacy
and location. However, it is imperative to
understand the target users and their
environmental context as a first step to designing
such a system (Nielsen, 1993). In this paper, we
provide background on the current state of rural
government service delivery in South Africa and
introduce the Lwazi project. We describe our
field methods, and finally, we present our
findings from the initial field work with design
and deployment implications for the Lwazi
system.

2. Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999555272727273">
In South Africa, rural citizens are faced with a
lack of economic activities and limited access to
resources. The South African government is
aware of both the need to improve citizen access
to services and the specific challenges that rural
communities face.
In this section, we note two successful rural
initiatives of the South African government
(Section 2.1) and we describe Lwazi (Section
2.2), a SDS designed to augment government’s
accessibility by eligible citizens.

2.1 Rural Initiatives in South Africa
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733607142857">
Two national efforts that are successfully
connecting rural South African citizens to
government services are (1) The Thusong
Service Centres (TSCs) and (2) Community
Development Workers (CDWs).
Thusong Service Centres (TSCs), formerly
known as MPCC (Multi-Purpose Community
Centres), were initiated in 1999 as a national
initiative to integrate government services into
primarily rural communities, where services and
participation by citizens was limited due to the
long distances they needed to travel (TSC 2008).
In June 7, 2008, the 100th TSC was opened. Each
TSC is a one-stop centre providing integrated
services and information from government to
rural community members close to where they
live.
Community Development Workers (CDWs)
were formed in 2004 as a national initiative to
further bridge the gap between government
services and eligible citizens, especially the rural
poor (CDW 2008). CDWs are members of rural
communities who are trained and employed by
the Department of Public Service and
Administration (DPSA) under the office of the
presidency. They work within their communities
and coordinate with municipal and provincial
offices. The primary responsibilities of a CDW is

2.2 Project Lwazi
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900055555556">
As part of the ICT initiative, an ambitious, three-
year project is currently being conducted by the
Human Language Technology (HLT) research
group under the Meraka institute, at the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in
South Africa. This project is funded by the South
African Department of Arts and Culture to
develop a multilingual telephone-based SDS that
would assist South African government service
delivery. “Lwazi,” derived from the IsiZulu
word for knowledge, aims to make a positive
impact in the daily lives of South Africans by
connecting them to government and health
services (Lwazi, 2008). The ability of SDSs to
overcome barriers of language, literacy, and
distances led the Lwazi team to explore a low-
cost application that would support the current
rural initiatives mentioned in 2.1.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.914531" genericHeader="method">
3. Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999794576923077">
First, we consulted previous research on
development and technology in South and
Southern Africa. We reviewed the most recent
census conducted (Statistics SA, 2007) for data
on infrastructure, income, language, and
technology use.
Then, eleven communities were visited by
small, interdisciplinary teams of researchers over
a period of 3 months in 2008. Of these eleven
centres, two were in peri-urban societies another
two in urban and the rest were based in rural
communities (Table 1). In each visit, the Lwazi
team gained access to the community through
the Thusong Service Centres (TSC’s) manager.
These individuals provided materials, office
space, and meetings with CDWs and key people
at the TSC.
We conducted between one and five key
informant interviews at each site with the TSC
employees, CDWs, and community members. In
four of the eleven sites, we also conducted a
focus group discussion. In two sites, we
shadowed a CDW during a typical day. We
visited farms, day-care centres, churches,
markets, youth centres, clinics, businesses and
households.

In this section, we present our overall results
from field visits in eleven communities of South
Africa (Section 4.1). In particular, we report on
factors that influence the design and potential
uptake of the Lwazi system in this context: the
information needs and sources (Section 4.2),
cultural and social factors (Section 4.3),
suitability of the technology (Section 4.4), and
user experience (Section 4.5).

4.1 Overall Results

The eleven communities we visited were located
throughout seven of the nine provinces of South
Africa. They varied greatly in available
infrastructure and languages spoken. They shared
an economic dependency on nearby cities and, in

some cases, reported social problems. These
communities also share a dependency on
government social grants.
During interviews and focus group
discussions with government employees and
community members, interviewees identified
what they perceived as the primary problems in
their communities. Across all eleven sites
visited, unemployment was most often reported
as the primary problem (Figure 2). In fact, our
team observed that in at least 8 of the sites
visited, the community&apos;s livelihood was entirely
sustained by government grants.
After unemployment, access to health and
social services was viewed as a primary problem
in six of the sites visited. Crime and substance
abuse were also reported as community
problems.

There are four mobile providers in South Africa
namely Cell-C, MTN, Virgin Mobile and
Vodacom. The two landline companies, Neo-tell
and Telkom are not familiar in the communities
visited by Lwazi team. Community members
prefer and use mobile phones because of ease of
use and accessibility. Figure 3 illustrates the use
of mobile providers in the eleven visited
communities.

4.2. Information Needs and Sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998738">
The majority of communities visited reported
lack of economic activity as the primary problem
in the community, and as could be expected, we
observed very high levels of unemployment.
Grants are offered by the South African
government to address the imbalance and
stimulate the economy of these areas. There are
six types of grants, namely: War Veteran grant,
Old Age grant, Disability grant, Care
dependency grant, Foster care grant and Child
support grant. Citizens can apply for these at
their nearest local South African social security
agency (SASSA) or district office.
Figure 4 shows that all eleven communities
visited received Vukuzenzele magazine, a
monthly government information sharing
medium. This is however not effective in these
communities where literacy levels are low. This,
as mentioned earlier, is one of the problems the
government is trying to address. The second
commonly used source of information was the
CDWs. This is a useful source because they are
the ‘foot soldiers’ of the government; they are
responsible for door to door visits, collecting and
delivering information.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.994957">
Figure 4: sources of government information
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969">
At the time of the visits, the eleven communities
received information from the Thusong Service
Centres. Government departments, NGOs,
municipalities and research institutes such the
CSIR, used the TSCs as a platform to
disseminate information. At a more grass roots
level, African communities in South Africa share
information by word of mouth. Local radio
stations and newspapers in local languages are
also important sources of information.

cities and visit only once or twice a year. As we
have previously mentioned, the lack of economic
activity means that these communities depend
heavily on government social grants. Older
people in these communities are often unable to
read and write. In some cases, their low literacy
levels and possible unfamiliarity with
technology restricts their ability to use the
cheaper “texting” feature of their mobile phones.
In the communities we visited, ten out of the
eleven official South African languages were
spoken. Each community typically spoke two or
more languages. A Lwazi system that delivers
information about SASSA services would be
more accessible to the older, rural population
than current print methods; the proposed system
would support a majority of the eleven
languages in order to offer a better information
channel.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998718">
4.4 Suitability of Technology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983375">
The research prior to the design of the Lwazi
system investigated how to ensure that the
proposed system will be suitable to the lifestyle
of the community to be served. We do know
that currently, communities have other means of
accessing government information, including the
free “Vukuzenzele” monthly magazine and local
radio stations. Like these current means, Lwazi
must be free in order to be effective and it must
contain content that is locally-relevant to these
peri-urban and rural communities. Government
departments will find Lwazi to be a very useful
and low-cost way of disseminating their
information. Rural South Africans will benefit
from the alternative source of critical
information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998542">
4.5 User Expertise
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997228">
We also sought to evaluate the current expertise
of potential Lwazi system users with telephony
and other ICT technologies. The user expertise
of telephony systems differ between young and
old. As mentioned earlier, households have at
least one cell phone. The older members of the
community use it to call and receive calls from
friends and children in neighbouring urban areas.
They do not know how to send text messages.
Some children have saved the full ‘Please call
me’ line as a quick dial so that their elder family
members can just press it in cases of emergency.
The young people on the other hand are well
versed with telephony technology. Most of them
are also familiar with the basic use of a
computer, despite their limited access to them.
The Lwazi system must be as simple as making a
phone call to a friend or relative in order to be
accessible to all. In most households, however,
there is someone who is technically competent.
Based on our fieldwork and recent user studies of
SDSs in developing regions, a Lwazi system
could be useable in the rural context of South
Africa, especially among the elderly and those
who do not read and write.

5. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994314">
5.1 Potential Uptake
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993842105264">
We saw two main areas where a telephony
service could be very useful. The first is in
supporting communication between community
and government. For example, a multilingual,
automated service could direct calls from
community members to the appropriate TSC
office or CDW, or perhaps provide locally-
relevant information such as office hours of
operation, directions to the office, and eligibility
requirements for services. Such a service might
reduce the amount of calls that a TSC office or
CDW would need to take personally. It could
also likely save a community member a trip if
they were sure beforehand what paperwork they
needed to bring and when the office was open. It
is important to mention here that the project will
require a buy-in from the local councillors of the
communities we will be piloting in.
The second area in which a telephony service
could be useful would be in facilitating internal
communication among government service
providers. CDWs may need to meet community
members face to face whenever possible.
Coordinating with government staff across the
municipality, district, province, or country could
happen remotely and efficiently if government
staff could use an automated telephony service to
send audio messages to several staff members at
once. The national coordinator for CDWs, for
example, could notify every CDW in the country
of upcoming events and policy changes with a
single phone call.
Many government officials, including
Thusong centre managers, felt the system might
assist them in communicating with the
communities they serve. There was, however, a
concern from one site that there are sections of
the population that do not have mobile
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998155">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970384615384">
connection or a reliable source of electricity to
charge their phones. These could be the
communities that need government services the
most. In these cases, Lwazi will have to play a
supportive role to the existing services provided
by the CDWs, rather than allowing direct access
by community members.
Our field work revealed the effectiveness of
national government programs to connect rural
citizens to available government services. Our
major finding was that although particulars about
the communities differed, individuals in the
eleven communities visited experienced barriers
to information access that could be mitigated
with automated telephony services, provided that
such services are toll free and localized to the
language and information relevant to the
particular rural community. Whereas
infrastructure such as roads, services, and in
some cases, electricity were limited, the mobile
phone network of South Africa is reliable and
widespread. We feel optimistic that the Lwazi
system will build on the available infrastructure
to transcend the barriers of geography and
improve the connection between citizens and
services.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987736">
5.2 Challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936702127659">
In a large and culturally diverse country such as
South Africa, deploying a SDS intended to
provide universal access is a great challenge.
Designing for any given user group often
requires a multiple iterations of testing and user
feedback. Our fieldwork revealed a diverse set of
end users; a successful design will require a
greater investment in time and resource to gather
detailed and accurate information about rural
South Africans. Although we plan to rely on our
partners (TSC and CDWs) on the ground for a
great deal of this information, we believe it is an
ambitious goal to expect deployment of the
Lwazi project in eleven languages country wide
by summer 2009.
Not only is the technological aspect very
ambitious, this kind of national government
sponsored system requires tactful management
of stakeholders. The success of the Lwazi project
relies on community members, government
partners, researchers, NGO&apos;s, and corporate
interests, all of whom have conflicting needs and
interests. Our team recognizes the importance of
managing stakeholder interests and has devised a
problem structuring method to facilitate
feedback and discussion (Plauché et al.,
submitted).
Community buy-in is critical to the success of
an ICT deployment. We found not only that the
TSC and CDW national coordinators but also
each of the communities visited were all excited
about the potential of the proposed system.
Generally, rural communities are comfortable
with the use of a mobile phone. But there is an
age difference in preference of different
applications. Because Lwazi is voice-based, the
senior citizens of the community will be more
likely to be excited about it than the younger
generations. Younger South Africans are
comfortable with the cheaper, text interface to
mobile phones. We recognise that Lwazi may not
suit the needs of all South Africans, but we aim
to make it accessible to those who are
historically excluded. In doing so, we hope to
have an overall impact in this country where only
26% of the population has a Matric or tertiary
education (Stats SA, 2007).

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999540117647059">
In this paper we evaluated the potential role of
Lwazi, a proposed telephone-based SDS, in
improving rural access to important government
services. The Lwazi project will create an open
platform for telephone-based services for
government to provide information in all eleven
languages. Lwazi will be especially useful if it
can reduce cost or the distances that people travel
to access government services and that the
distances that government workers travel to
check in with municipal offices. Our team plans
to conduct pilots in two communities in the
summer of 2009. A successful pilot in one of
these communities will then burgeon into a
national service for all South Africans to
empower themselves through improved access to
information, services and government resources.

The goal of the fieldwork was to evaluate the potential role of automated telephony services in improving access to important government information and services. Our interviews, focus group discussions and surveys revealed that Lwazi, a telephone-based spoken dialog system, could greatly support current South African government efforts to effectively connect citizens to available services, provided such services be toll free, in local languages, and with content relevant to each community.</abstract>

In rural communities of developing regions, where infrastructure, distances, language and literacy are barriers to access, but where mobile phones are prevalent, an SDS could be key to unlocking social and economic growth (Barnard et al., 2003). Some notable recent studies in this field include “Tamil Market” (Plauché et al., 2006) and “VoiKiosk” (Agarwal et al., 2008). Both were kiosk-based SDSs providing agricultural information that were tested in rural, semiliterate communities in India. Nasfors (2007) also developed an agricultural information service, aimed at mobile telephone users in Kenya. “Healthline” was evaluated by a small set of community health workers in Pakistan (Sherwani et al., 2007), who had trouble with the voice-based interface, presumably due to their limited literacy.

The percentage of both rural and urban households with mobile phones tripled from 2001 to 2007, while “landline” use declined. The accessibility and widespread use of mobile phones make SDSs a good candidate for low-cost information access. In South Africa, there are eleven official languages. Private companies, NGOs and government offices who wish to reach South Africans through print or audio, find it extremely costly to do so for each language. Heugh (2007) shows that in terms of speakers&apos; proficiency, there is no single lingua franca for South Africans (see Figure 1).

This project is funded by the South African Department of Arts and Culture to develop a multilingual telephone-based SDS that would assist South African government service delivery. “Lwazi,” derived from the IsiZulu word for knowledge, aims to make a positive impact in the daily lives of South Africans by connecting them to government and health services (Lwazi, 2008). The ability of SDSs to overcome barriers of language, literacy, and distances led the Lwazi team to explore a lowcost application that would support the current rural initiatives mentioned in 2.1. 3. Method First, we consulted previous research on development and technology in South and Southern Africa. We reviewed the most recent census conducted (Statistics SA, 2007) for data on infrastructure, income, language, and technology use.

The amount of mobile phone users in South Africa is an astonishing 30 million people - out of a total population of 47 million (Benjamin, 2007).

NGOs face the same challenge when trying to reach rural populations. Many produce information to assist households affected by HIV/AIDS, for example, but most of the materials are published on websites; the cost of providing multilingual print materials is often too high. Due to low literacy levels, language, and a lack of infrastructure, the information remains inaccessible to the people who need it, especially those living in rural areas and townships (Benjamin, 2007). Given the well developed mobile phone network and the relatively sparse alternative options in rural South Africa, the authors believe that multilingual SDSs can provide a low-cost solution to improving the ICT access of citizens who may currently be excluded from government services due to language, literacy and location. However, it is imperative to understand the target users and their environmental context as a first step to designing such a system (Nielsen, 1993). In this paper, we provide background on the current state of rural government service delivery in South Africa and introduce</context>

In rural communities of developing regions, where infrastructure, distances, language and literacy are barriers to access, but where mobile phones are prevalent, an SDS could be key to unlocking social and economic growth (Barnard et al., 2003). Some notable recent studies in this field include “Tamil Market” (Plauché et al., 2006) and “VoiKiosk” (Agarwal et al., 2008). Both were kiosk-based SDSs providing agricultural information that were tested in rural, semiliterate communities in India. Nasfors (2007) also developed an agricultural information service, aimed at mobile telephone users in Kenya. “Healthline” was evaluated by a small set of community health workers in Pakistan (Sherwani et al., 2007), who had trouble with the voice-based interface, presumably due to their limited literacy. In a more recent study, Sharma et al. (2008) evaluated a SDS designed for caregivers of HIV positive children in Botswana. The researchers found that the users performe</context>
