Questioning texts represented in semantic
relations&apos; requires the recognition that synonyms,
instances, and hyponyms may all satisfy a questioned
term. A basic procedure for accomplishing such loose
matching using inheritance from a taxonomic
organization of the dictionary is defined in analogy with
the unification algorithm used for theorem proving, and
the costs of its application are analyzed. It is concluded
that inheritance logic can profitably be included in the
basic questioning procedure.

In studying the pronss of answering questions
from fifty pages of the Al Handbook, it is striking that
such subsections as those describing problem
representations are organized so as to define conceptual
dictionary entries for the terms. First, class definitions
are offered and their terms defined; then examples are
given and the computational terms of the definitions are
instantiated. Finally the technique described is applied
to examples and redefined mathematically. Organizing
these texts (by hand) into coherent hierarchic structures
of discourse results in very usable conceptual dictionary
definitions that are related by taxonomic and partitive
relations, leaving gaps only for non-technical terms. For
example, in &apos;give snapshots of the state of the problem
at various stages in its solution,&apos; terms such as &apos;state&apos;,
&apos;problem, and &apos;solution&apos; are defined by the text, while
&apos;give&apos;, &apos;snapshots&apos;, and &apos;stages&apos; are not.
Our first, studies in representing and questioning
this text have used semantic networks with a minimal
number of case arcs to represent the sentences and
Superset/Instance and 50f/Has arcs to represent,
respectively, taxonomic and partitive relations between
concepts. Equivalence arcs are also used to represent
certain relations signified by uses of &apos;is&apos; and apposition

and *AND and *OR arcs represent conjunction. Since
June 1982, eight question-answering systems have been &apos;
written, some in procedural logic and some in compilable
EI,ISP. Although we have so far studied questioning and
data manipulation operations on about 40 pages of the
text, the detailed study of inheritance costs discussed in
this paper was based on 170 semantic relations (SRs),
represented by 733 binary relations each composed of a
node-arc-node triple. In this study the only inference
rules used were those needed to obtain transitive closure
for inheritance, but. in other studies of this text a great
deal of power is gained by using general inference rules
for paraphrasing the question into the terms given by an
answering text. The use of paraphrastic inference rules is
computationally expensive and is discussed elsewhere
[Simmons 1983].
The text-knowledge base is constructed either as
a set of triples using subscripted words, or by establishing
node-numbers whose values are the complete SR and
indexing these by the first element of every SR. The
latter form, shown in Figure 1, occupies only about a
third of the space that the triples require and neither
form is clearly computationally better than the other.
The first experiments with this text-knowledge
base showed that the cost of following inheritance arcs,
i.e. obtaining taxonomic closures for concepts, was very
high; some questions required as much as a minute of
central processor time. As a result it was necessary to
analyze the process and to develop an understanding that
would minimize any redundant computation. Our
current system for questioning this fragment knowledge
base has reduced the computation time to the range of
1/2 to less than 15 seconds per question in uncompiled
ELISP on a DEC 2060.
I believe the approach taken in this study is of
particular interest to researchers who plan to use the
taxonomic structure of ordinary dictionaries in support of
natural language processing operations. Beginning with
studies made in 1975 [Simmons and Chester, 1977] it was
apparent to us that question-answering could be viewed
profitably as a specialized form of theorem proving that

Relaxed Unification for Matching Semantic
Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970639866666666">
In the unification algorithm, two n-tuples, n1 and
n2, unify if .Arity(n1) = _Arity(n2) and if every element in
n1 matches an element in n2. Two elements el and e2
match if el or e2 is a variable, or if el = e2, or in the
case that el and e2 are lists of the same length, each of
the elements of el matches a corresponding element of
e2.
Since semantic relations (SRs) are unordered lists
of binary relations that vary in length and since a
question representation (SRq) can be answered by a
sentence candidate (SRc) that includes more information
than the question specified, the Arity constraint is revised
to Arity(SRq) Less/Equal Arity(SRc).
The primitive elements of SRs include words,
arcnames, variables and constants. Arcnames and words
are organized taxonomically, and words are further
organized by the discourse structures in which they
occur. One or more element of taxonomic or discourse
structure may imply others. Words in general can be
viewed as restricted variables whose values can be any
other word on an acceptable inference path (usually
taxonomic) that joins them. The matching constraints of
unification can thus be relaxed by allowing two terms to
match if one implies the other in a taxonomic closure.
The matching procedure is further adapted to
read Os effectively as unordered lists of triples and to
seek for each triple in My a corresponding one in SRc.
The two SRs below match because Head matches Head,
Arc! matches Arc!, Vail matches Vail, etc. even though
they are not given in the same order.

Two triples match in Relaxed Unification according at
least) to the conditions shown in Figure 2. The query
triple, A R B may match the candidate giving + + + to
signify that all three elements unified. If the first two
elements match, the third may be matched using the
procedures CLOSAB or CLOSCP to relate the .non-
matching C with the question term B by discovering that
B is either in the abstractive closure or the complex
product closure of C. The abstractive closure of an
element is the set of all triples that can be reached by
following separately the SUP and EQUIV arcs and the
INST and EQUIV* arcs. The complex product closure is
the set of triples that can be reached by following a set of
generally transitive arcs (not including the abstractive
ones). The arc of the question may have a synonym or a
converse and so develop alternative questions, and
additional questions may be derived by asking such terms
as C R B that include the question term A in their
•abstractive closure. Both closure procedures should be
limited to n-step paths where n is a value between 3 and
6.

Computational Cost

<bodyText confidence="0.999935363636364">
In the above recursive definition the cost is not
immediately obvious. If it is mapped onto a graphic
representation in semantic network form, it is possible to
see some of its implications. Essentially the procedure
first seeks a direct match between a question term and a
candidate answer; if the match fails, the abstractive
closure arcs, SUP, INST, EQUIV, and EQUIV* may lead.
to a new candidate that does match. If these fail, then
complex product arcs, *OF, HAS, LOC, AND, and OR
may lead to a matching value. The graph below outlines
the essence of the procedure.

A---R---B---SUP---Q
---INST---Q
---EQUIV---Q
---*AND---Q
---*OR----Q
---LOC---Q
---*OF---Q
This graph shows nine possible complex product paths to
follow in seeking a match between B and Q. If we allow
each path to extend N steps such that each step has the
same number of possible paths, then the worst case
computation, assuming each candidate SR has all the
arcs, is of the order, 9 raised to the Nth. If the A term of
the question also has these possibilities, and the R term
has a synonym, then there appear to be 2*2*9**Nth
possible candidates for answers. The first factor of 2
reflects the converse by assigning the A term 9**N paths.
Assuming only one synonym, each of two R terms might
lead to a B via any of 9 paths, giving the second factor of
2. If the query arc is also transitive, then the power
factor 9 is increased by one.
In fact, SRs representing ordinary text appear to
have less than an average of 3 possible CP paths, so
something like 2*3**Nth seems to be the average cost. So
if N is limited to 3 there are about 2*81=162 candidates
to be examined for each subquestion. These are merely
rough estimates, but if the question is composed of 5
subquestions, we might expect to examine something on
the order of a thousand candidates in a complete search
for the answer. Fortunately, this is accomplished in a few
seconds of computation time.
The length of transitive path is also of
importance for two other reasons. First, most of the CP
arcs lend only to probable inference. Even superset and
instance are really only highly probable indicators of
equivalence, while LOC, HAS, and *OF are even less
certain. Thus if the probability of truth of match is less
than one for each step, the number of steps that can
reasonably be taken must be sharply limited. Second, it
is the case empirically that the great majority of answers
to questions are found with short paths of inference. In
one all-answers version of the QA-system, we found a
puzzling phenomenon in that all of the answers were
typically found in the first fifteen seconds of computation
although the exploration continued for up to 50 seconds.
Our current hypothesis is that the likelihood of
discovering an answer falls off rapidly as the length of
the inference path increases.
Disussion
It is important to note that this experiment was
solely concerned with the simple levels of inference
concerned in inheritance from a taxonomic structure. It
shows that this class of inference can be embedded
profitably in a procedure for relaxed unification. In
addition it allows us to state rules of inference in the
form of semantic relations.
For example we know that the commander of
troops is responsible for the outcome of their battles. So
if we know that Cornwallis commanded an army and the
army lost a battle, then we can conclude correctly that
Cornwallis lost the battle. An SR inference rule to this
effect is shown below:

The relaxed unification procedure described earlier allows
us to match the theorem with the consequent of the rule
which is then proved if its antecedents are proved. It can
be noticed that what is being accomplished is the
definition of a theorem prover for the loosely ordered
logic of semantic relations. We have used such rules for
answering questions of the Al handbook text, but have
not yet determined whether the cost of using such rules
with relaxed unification can be justified (or whether some
theoretically less appealing compilation is needed).

If these complex product arcs, *OF, HAS, LOC, AND, and OR may lead to a matching value. The graph below outlines the essence of the procedure. 73 A---R---B---SUP---Q ---INST---Q ---EQUIV---Q ---*AND---Q ---*OR----Q ---LOC---Q ---*OF---Q This graph shows nine possible complex product paths to in seeking a match between B and If allow each path to extend N steps such that each step has the same number of possible paths, then the worst case computation, assuming each candidate SR has all the arcs, is of the order, 9 raised to the Nth. If the A term of the question also has these possibilities, and the R term has a synonym, then there appear to be 2*2*9**Nth possible candidates for answers. The first factor of 2 reflects the converse by assigning the A term 9**N paths. Assuming only one synonym, each of two R terms might lead to a B via any of 9 paths, giving the second factor of 2. If the query arc is also transitive, then the power factor 9 is increased by one. In fact, SRs representing ordinary text appear to have less than an average of 3 possible CP paths, so something like 2*3**Nth seems to be the average cost. So if N is limited to 3 there are about 2*81=162 candidates to be examined for each subquestion. These are merely rough estimates, but if the question is composed of 5 subquestions, we might expect to examine something on the order of a thousand candidates in a complete search for the answer. Fortunately, this is accomplished in a few seconds of computation time. The length of transitive path is also of importance for two other reasons. First, most of the CP arcs lend only to probable inference. Even superset and instance are really only highly probable indicators of equivalence, while LOC, HAS, and *OF are even less certain. Thus if the probability of truth of match is less than one for each step, the number of steps that can reasonably be taken must be sharply limited. Second, it is the case empirically that the great majority of answers to questions are found with short paths of inference. In one all-answers version of the QA-system, we found a puzzling phenomenon in that all of the answers were found in fifteen of computation although the exploration continued for up to 50 seconds. current hypothesis is that likelihood of discovering an answer falls off rapidly as the length of the inference path increases. Disussion It is important to note that this experiment was solely concerned with the simple levels of inference concerned in inheritance from a taxonomic structure. It shows that this class of inference can be embedded profitably in a procedure for relaxed unification. In addition it allows us to state rules of inference in the form of semantic relations. For example we know that the commander of troops is responsible for the outcome of their battles. So if we know that Cornwallis commanded an army and the army lost a battle, then we can conclude correctly that Cornwallis lost the battle. An SR inference rule to this effect is shown below:</abstract>
<title confidence="0.47190525">Rule Axiom: ((LOSE AGT X AE Y) &lt;— (SUP X COMMANDER) (SUP Y BATTLE) (COMMAND AGT X AE W) (SUP W MILITARY-GROUP) (LOSE AGT W AE Y)) Text Axioms: ((COMMAND AGT CORNWALLIS</title>

<abstract confidence="0.9913611">The relaxed unification procedure described earlier allows us to match the theorem with the consequent of the rule which is then proved if its antecedents are proved. It can be noticed that what is being accomplished is the definition of a theorem prover for the loosely ordered logic of semantic relations. We have used such rules for questions of the text, but have not yet determined whether the cost of using such rules with relaxed unification can be justified (or whether some theoretically less appealing compilation is needed).</abstract>

A procedural logic question-answerer was later developed and specialized to understanding a story about the flight of a rocket [Simmons 1984, Simmons and Chester, 1982, Levine 19801. Although it was effective in answering a wide range of ordinary questions, we were disturbed at the magnitude of computation that was sometimes required. This led us to the challenge of developing a system that would work effectively with large bodies of text, particularly the Al Handbook. The choice of this text proved fortunate in that it provided experience with rwiny taxonomic and partitive relations that were essential to answering a test sample of questions.

In this study the only inference rules used were those needed to obtain transitive closure for inheritance, but. in other studies of this text a great deal of power is gained by using general inference rules for paraphrasing the question into the terms given by an answering text. The use of paraphrastic inference rules is computationally expensive and is discussed elsewhere [Simmons 1983]. The text-knowledge base is constructed either as a set of triples using subscripted words, or by establishing node-numbers whose values are the complete SR and indexing these by the first element of every SR. The latter form, shown in Figure 1, occupies only about a third of the space that the triples require and neither form is clearly computationally better than the other. The first experiments with this text-knowledge base showed that the cost of following inheritance arcs, i.e. obtaining taxonomic closures for concepts, was very high; some questions required as much as a minute of centr</context>

As a result it was necessary to analyze the process and to develop an understanding that would minimize any redundant computation. Our current system for questioning this fragment knowledge base has reduced the computation time to the range of 1/2 to less than 15 seconds per question in uncompiled ELISP on a DEC 2060. I believe the approach taken in this study is of particular interest to researchers who plan to use the taxonomic structure of ordinary dictionaries in support of natural language processing operations. Beginning with studies made in 1975 [Simmons and Chester, 1977] it was apparent to us that question-answering could be viewed profitably as a specialized form of theorem proving that 71 Example SR representation for a sentence: (C100 A STATE-SPACE REPRESENTATION OF A PROBLEM EMPLOYS TWO KINDS OF ENTITIES: STATES, WHICH ARE DATA STRUCTURES GIVING &apos;SNAPSHOTS&apos; OF THE CONDITION OF THE PROBLEM AT EACH STAGE OF ITS SOLUTION, AND OPERATORS, WHICH ARE MEANS FOR TRANSFORMING THE PROBLEM FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER) (N137 (REPRESENTATION SUP N101 HAS N138 EG N139 SNT C100)) (N138 (ENTITY NBR PL QTY 2.
