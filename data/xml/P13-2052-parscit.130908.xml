Linking heterogeneous resources is a major re-
search challenge in the Semantic Web. This
paper studies the task of mining equivalent re-
lations from Linked Data, which was insuffi-
ciently addressed before. We introduce an un-
supervised method to measure equivalency of
relation pairs and cluster equivalent relations.
Early experiments have shown encouraging
results with an average of 0.75~0.87 precision
in predicting relation pair equivalency and
0.78~0.98 precision in relation clustering.

Linked Data defines best practices for exposing,
sharing, and connecting data on the Semantic
Web using uniform means such as URIs and
RDF. It constitutes the conjunction between the
Web and the Semantic Web, balancing the rich-
ness of semantics offered by Semantic Web with
the easiness of data publishing. For the last few
years Linked Open Data has grown to a gigantic
knowledge base, which, as of 2013, comprised
31 billion triples in 295 datasets1.
A major research question concerning Linked
Data is linking heterogeneous resources, the fact
that publishers may describe analogous infor-
mation using different vocabulary, or may assign
different identifiers to the same referents. Among
such work, many study mappings between ontol-
ogy concepts and data instances (e.g., Isaac et al,
2007; Mi et al., 2009; Le et al., 2010; Duan et al.,
2012). An insufficiently addressed problem is
linking heterogeneous relations, which is also
widely found in data and can cause problems in
information retrieval (Fu et al., 2012). Existing
work in linking relations typically employ string
similarity metrics or semantic similarity mea-

sures that require a-priori domain knowledge and
are limited in different ways (Zhong et al., 2002;
Volz et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Zhao and
Ichise, 2011; Zhao and Ichise, 2012).
This paper introduces a novel method to dis-
cover equivalent groups of relations for Linked
Data concepts. It consists of two components: 1)
a measure of equivalency between pairs of rela-
tions of a concept and 2) a clustering process to
group equivalent relations. The method is unsu-
pervised; completely data-driven requiring no a-
priori domain knowledge; and also language in-
dependent. Two types of experiments have been
carried out using two major Linked Data sets: 1)
evaluating the precision of predicting equivalen-
cy of relation pairs and 2) evaluating the preci-
sion of clustering equivalent relations. Prelimi-
nary results have shown encouraging results as
the method achieves between 0.75~0.85 preci-
sion in the first set of experiments while
0.78~0.98 in the latter.

Research on linking heterogeneous ontological
resources mostly addresses mapping classes (or
concepts) and instances (Isaac et al, 2007; Mi et
al., 2009; Le et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2012;
Schopman et al., 2012), typically based on the
notions of similarity. This is often evaluated by
string similarity (e.g. string edit distance), se-
mantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006),
and distributional similarity based on the overlap
in data usage (Duan et al., 2012; Schopman et
al., 2012). There have been insufficient studies
on mapping relations (or properties) across on-
tologies. Typical methods make use of a combi-
nation of string similarity and semantic similarity
metrics (Zhong et al., 2002; Volz et al., 2009;
Han et al., 2011; Zhao and Ichise, 2012). While
string similarity fails to identify equivalent rela-
tions if their lexicalizations are distinct, semantic
similarity often depends on taxonomic structures

in existing ontologies (Budanitsky and Hirst,
2006). Unfortunately many Linked Data instanc-
es use relations that are invented arbitrarily or
originate in rudimentary ontologies (Parundekar
et al., 2012). Distributional similarity has also
been used to discover equivalent or similar rela-
tions. Mauge et al. (2012) extract product proper-
ties from an e-commerce website and align
equivalent properties using a supervised maxi-
mum entropy classification method. We study
linking relations on Linked Data and propose an
unsupervised method. Fu et al. (2012) identify
similar relations using the overlap of the subjects
of two relations and the overlap of their objects.
On the contrary, we aim at identifying strictly
equivalent relations rather than similarity in gen-
eral. Additionally, the techniques introduced our
work is also related to work on aligning multilin-
gual Wikipedia resources (Adar et al., 2009;
Bouma et al., 2009) and semantic relatedness
(Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989592592593">
Let t denote a 3-tuple (triple) consisting of a sub-
ject (ts), predicate (tp) and object (to). Linked Da-
ta resources are typed and its type is called class.
We write type (ts) = c meaning that ts is of class c.
p denotes a relation and rp is a set of triples
whose tp=p, i.e., rp={t  |tp = p}.
Given a specific class c, and its pairs of rela-
tions (p, p’) such that rp={t|tp=p, type(ts)=c} and
rp’={t|tp=p’, type (ts)=c}, we measure the equiv-
alency of p and p’ and then cluster equivalent
relations. The equivalency is calculated locally
(within same class c) rather than globally (across
all classes) because two relations can have iden-
tical meaning in specific class context but not
necessarily so in general. For example, for the
class Book, the relations dbpp:title and foaf:name
are used with the same meaning, however for
Actor, dbpp:title is used interchangeably with
awards dbpp:awards (e.g., Oscar best actor).
In practice, given a class c, our method starts
with retrieving all t from a Linked Data set
where type(ts)=c, using the universal query lan-
guage SPARQL with any SPARQL data end-
point. This data is then used to measure equiva-
lency for each pair of relations (Section 3.1). The
equivalence scores are then used to group rela-
tions in equivalent clusters (Section 3.2).

3.1 Measure of equivalence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
The equivalence for each distinct pair of rela-
tions depends on three components.
Triple overlap evaluates the degree of over-
lap2 in terms of the usage of relations in triples.
Let SO(p) be the collection of subject-object
pairs from rp and SOint the intersection
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.948909">
SO;,u(P,P&apos;) = SO(rP)nSO(rP,) [1]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969593125">
then the triple overlap TO(p, p’) is calculated as
Intuitively, if two relations p and p’ have a
large overlap of subject-object pairs in their data
instances, they are likely to have identical mean-
ing. The MAX function allows addressing infre-
quently used, but still equivalent relations (i.e.,
where the overlap covers most triples of an in-
frequently used relation but only a very small
proportion of a much more frequently used).
Subject agreement While triple overlap looks
at the data in general, subject agreement looks at
the overlap of subjects of two relations, and the
degree to which these subjects have overlapping
objects. Let S(p) return the set of subjects of rela-
tion p, and O(p|s) returns the set of objects of
relation p whose subjects are s, i.e.:

Equation [5] counts the number of overlapping
subjects whose objects have at least one overlap.
The higher the value of α, the more the two rela-
tions “agree” in terms of their shared subjects.
For each shared subject of p and p’ we count 1 if
they have at least 1 overlapping object and 0 oth-
erwise. This is because both p and p’ can be
1:many relations and a low overlap value could
mean that one is densely populated while the
other is not, which does not necessarily mean
they do not “agree”. Equation [6] evaluates the
degree to which two relations share the same set
of subjects. The agreement AG(p, p’) balances
the two factors by taking the product. As a result,

relations that have high level of agreement will
have more subjects in common, and higher pro-
portion of shared subjects with shared objects.
Cardinality ratio is a ratio between cardinali-
ty of the two relations. Cardinality of a relation
CD(p) is calculated based on data:
and the cardinality ratio is calculated as
The final equivalency measure integrates all
the three components to return a value in [0, 2]:

similar cardinality.

3.2 Clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998519">
We apply the measure to every pair of relations
of a concept, and keep those with a non-zero
equivalence score. The goal of clustering is to
create groups of equivalent relations based on the
pair-wise equivalence scores. We use a simple
rule-based agglomerative clustering algorithm
for this purpose. First, we rank all relation pairs
by their equivalence score, then we keep a pair if
(i) its score and (ii) the number of triples covered
by each relation are above a certain threshold,
TminEqvl and TminTP respectively. Each pair forms
an initial cluster. To merge clusters, given an
existing cluster c and a new pair (p, p’) where
either pc or p’c, the pair is added to c if E(p,
p’) is close (as a fractional number above the
threshold TminEqvlRel) to the average scores of all
connected pairs in c. This preserves the strong
connectivity in a cluster. This is repeated until no
merge action is taken. Adjusting these thresholds
allows balancing between precision and recall.

We apply our method to each concept to dis-
cover clusters of equivalent relations, using as
SPARQL endpoint both DBpedia3 and Sindice4
and report results separately. This is to study
how the method performs in different conditions:
on one hand on a smaller and cleaner dataset
(DBpedia); on the other hand on a larger and
multi-lingual dataset (Sindice) to also test cross-
lingual capability of our method. We chose rela-
tively low thresholds, i.e. TminEqvl=0.1, TminTP=
0.01% and TminEqvlRel=0.6, in order to ensure high
recall without sacrificing much precision.
Four human annotators manually annotated
the output for each concept. For this preliminary
evaluation, we have limited the amount of anno-
tations to a maximum of 100 top scoring pairs of
relations per concept, resulting in 16~100 pairs
per concept (avg. 40) for DBpedia experiment
and 29~100 pairs for Sindice (avg. 91). The an-
notators were asked to rate each edge in each
cluster with -1 (wrong), 1 (correct) or 0 (cannot
decide). Pairs with 0 are ignored in the evalua-
tion (about 12% for DBpedia; and 17% for Sin-
dice mainly due to unreadable encoded URLs for
certain languages). To evaluate cross-lingual
pairs, we asked annotators to use translation
tools. Inter-Annotator-Agreement (observed
IAA) is shown in Table 1. Also using this data,
we derived a gold standard for clustering based
on edge connectivity and we evaluate (i) the pre-
cision of top n% (p@n%) ranked equivalent rela-
tion pairs and (ii) the precision of clustering for
each concept.

So far the output of 13 concepts has been an-
notated. This dataset5 contains ≈1800 relation
pairs and is larger than the one by Fu et al.
(2012). Annotation process shows that over 75%
of relation pairs in the Sindice experiment con-
tain non-English relations and mostly are cross-
lingual. We used this data to report performance,
although the method has been applied to all the
21 concepts, and the complete results can be vis-

As it is shown in Figure 2, Linked Data rela-
tions are often heterogeneous. Therefore, finding
equivalent relations to improve coverage is im-
portant. Results in Figure 3 show that in most
cases the method identifies equivalent relations
with high precision. It is effective for both sin-
gle- and cross-language relation pairs. The worst
performing case for DBpedia is Aircraft (for all
n%), mostly due to duplicating numeric valued
objects of different relations (e.g., weight, length,
capacity). The decreasing precision with respect
to n% suggests the measure effectively ranks
correct pairs to the top. This is a useful feature
from IR point of view. Figure 4 shows that the
method effectively clusters equivalent relations
with very high precision: 0.8~0.98 in most cases.

Overall we believe the results of this early proof-
of-concept are encouraging. As a concrete exam-
ple to compare against Fu et al. (2012), for Bas-
ketballPlayer, our method creates separate clus-
ters for relations meaning “draft team” and “for-
mer team” because although they are “similar”
they are not “equivalent”.
We noticed that annotating equivalent rela-
tions is a non-trivial task. Sometimes relations
and their corresponding schemata (if any) are
poorly documented and it is impossible to under-
stand the meaning of relations (e.g., due to acro-
nyms) and even very difficult to reason based on
data. Analyses of the evaluation output show that
errors are typically found between highly similar
relations, or whose object values are numeric
types. In both cases, there is a very high proba-
bility of having a high overlap of subject-object
pairs between relations. For example, for Air-
craft, the relations dbpp:heightIn and dbpp:
weight are predicted to be equivalent because
many instances have the same numeric value for
the properties. Another example are the Airport
properties dbpp:runwaySurface, dbpp:r1Surface,
dbpp:r2Surface etc., which according to the data
seem to describe the construction material (e.g.,
concrete, asphalt) of airport runways. The rela-
tions are semantically highly similar and the ob-
ject values have a high overlap. A potential solu-
tion to such issues is incorporating ontological
knowledge if available. For example, if an ontol-
ogy defines the two distinct properties of Airport
without explicitly defining an “equivalence” re-
lation between them, they are unlikely to be
equivalent even if the data suggests the opposite.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999785">
This paper introduced a data-driven, unsuper-
vised and domain and language independent
method to learn equivalent relations for Linked
Data concepts. Preliminary experiments show
encouraging results as it effectively discovers
equivalent relations in both single- and multi-
lingual settings. In future, we will revise the
equivalence measure and also experiment with
clustering algorithms such as (Beeferman et al.,
2000). We will also study the contribution of
individual components of the measure in such
task. Large scale comparative evaluations (incl.
recall) are planned and this work will be extend-
ed to address other tasks such as ontology map-
ping and ontology pattern mining (Nuzzolese et
al., 2011).

Annotation process shows that over 75% of relation pairs in the Sindice experiment contain non-English relations and mostly are crosslingual.

The decreasing precision with respect to n% suggests the measure effectively ranks correct pairs to the top. This is a useful feature from IR point of view. Figure 4 shows that the method effectively clusters equivalent relations with very high precision: 0.8~0.98 in most cases. 6 Per-concept results are available on our website. Overall we believe the results of this early proofof-concept are encouraging. As a concrete example to compare against Fu et al. (2012), for BasketballPlayer, our method creates separate clusters for relations meaning “draft team” and “former team” because although they are “similar” they are not “equivalent”. We noticed that annotating equivalent relations is a non-trivial task. Sometimes relations and their corresponding schemata (if any) are poorly documented and it is impossible to understand the meaning of relations (e.g., due to acronyms) and even very difficult to reason based on data. Analyses of the evaluation output show that errors are typically found between highly similar relations, or whose object values are num</context>

While string similarity fails to identify equivalent relations if their lexicalizations are distinct, semantic similarity often depends on taxonomic structures 289 Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 289–293, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics a � in existing ontologies (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).

Among such work, many study mappings between ontology concepts and data instances (e.g., Isaac et al, 2007; Mi et al., 2009; Le et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2012). An insufficiently addressed problem is linking heterogeneous relations, which is also widely found in data and can cause problems in information retrieval (Fu et al., 2012). Existing work in linking relations typically employ string similarity metrics or semantic similarity mea1 http://lod-cloud.net/state/ sures that require a-priori domain knowledge and are limited in different ways (Zhong et al., 2002; Volz et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Zhao and Ichise, 2011; Zhao and Ichise, 2012). This paper introduces a novel method to discover equivalent groups of relations for Linked Data concepts. It consists of two components: 1) a measure of equivalency between pairs of relations of a concept and 2) a clustering process to group equivalent relations. The method is unsupervised; completely data-driven requiring no apriori domain knowledge; and also language independent. Two types of experiments have been carried out using two major Linked Data sets: 1) evaluating the precision of predicting equiva</context>

This is often evaluated by string similarity (e.g. string edit distance), semantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), and distributional similarity based on the overlap in data usage (Duan et al., 2012; Schopman et al., 2012).
