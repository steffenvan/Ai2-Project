We present a word alignment procedure based
on a syntactic dependency analysis of
French/English parallel corpora called
“alignment by syntactic propagation”. Both
corpora are analysed with a deep and robust
parser. Starting with an anchor pair consisting
of two words which are potential translations
of one another within aligned sentences, the
alignment link is propagated to the
syntactically connected words. The method
was tested on two corpora and achieved a
precision of 94.3 and 93.1% as well as a recall
of 58 and 56%, respectively for each corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986684210527">
It is now an aknowledged fact that parallel
corpora, i.e. corpora made of texts in one language
and their translation in another language, are well
suited in particular to cope with the problem of the
construction of bilingual resources such as
bilingual lexicons or terminologies. Several works
have focused on the alignment of units which are
smaller than a sentence, for instance words or
phrases, as to produce bilingual word, phrase or
term associations. A common assumption is that
the alignment of words or phrases raises a real
challenge, since it is “neither one-to-one, nor
sequential, nor compact”, and thus “the
correspondences are fuzzy and contextual” (Debili,
1997). Indeed, it is even often diffult for a human
to determine which source unit correspond to
which target unit within aligned sentences (Och
and Ney, 2003).
Most alignment systems working on parallel
corpora rely on statistical models, in particular the
EM ones (Brown, Della Pietra and Mercer, 1993).
Quite recently attempts have been made in order to
incorporate different types of linguistic
information sources into word and phrase
alignment systems. The idea is to take into account
the specific problems arising from the alignment at
the word or phrase level mentioned in particular by
Debili (1997). Different types of linguistic
knowledge are exploited: morphological, lexical
and syntactic ones. In the method described in this
article, the syntactic information is the kernel of
the alignment process. Indeed, syntactic relations
identified on both sides of the French/English
parallel corpus with a deep and robust parser are
used to find out new correspondences between
words or to confirm existing ones in order to
achieve a high accuracy alignment. We call this
procedure “alignment by syntactic propagation”.

2 State of the art
2.1 Term alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964741935484">
Two kinds of methods have been basically
proposed in order to address the problem of
bilingual lexicon extraction. On the one hand,
terms are recognized in both source and target
language and then they are mapped to each other
(Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994). On the other
hand, only source terms are extracted and the
target ones are discovered through the alignment
process (Gaussier, 1998; Hull, 2001). The
alignment between terms is obtained either by
computing association probabilities (Gaussier,
1998 ; Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994) or by
identifying, for a given source term, a sequence of
words in the target language which is likely to
contain or to correspond to its translation (Hull,
2001). In so far as the precision rate may be
affected by the number of alignments obtained
(Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994; Gaussier,
1998), the results achieved basically range between
80% and 90%, for the first 500 alignments. As for
the method described in (Hull, 2001), the precison
reported is 56%.
It should be noticed that the use of linguistic
knowledge is most of the time restricted to the
term recognition stage. This kind of knowledge is
quite rarely taken into account within the very
alignment process, except for the approach
implemented by Daille, Gaussier and Langé
(1994), which try to take advantage of
correspondences between the syntactic patterns
defined for each language.

2.2 Word alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996085">
Quite recently attempts have been made in order
to incorporate different types of linguistic
information sources into word alignment systems
and to combine them with statistical knowledge.
Various and more or less complex sources of
linguistic knowledge are exploited: morphological,
lexical (Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel, 2000)
and syntactic knowledge (Wu, 2000; Lin and
Cherry, 2003). The contribution of these
information sources to the alignment process with
respect to the statistical data varies according to the
considered system. However, as pointed out by
Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel (2000) as well
as Lin and Cherry (2003), the introduction of
linguistic knowledge leads to a significant
improvement in alignment quality. In the first case,
the accuracy goes from 91% for a baseline
configuration up to 96.7% for a linguistic
knowledge based one. In the second, the precision
rate is increased from 82.7% up to 89.2% and the
improvement noticed have been confirmed within
the framework of an evaluation task (Mihalcea and
Pedersen, 20003).
For our part, we propose a method in which the
syntactic information plays a major role in the
alignment process, since syntactic relations are
used to find out new correspondences between
words or to confirm the existent ones. We chose
this approach in order to achieve a high accuracy
alignment both at word and phrase level. Indeed,
we aim at capturing frequent alignments between
words and phrases as well as those involving
sparse or corpus specific ones. Moreover, as
stressed in previous works, using syntactic
dependencies seems to be particularly well suited
to solve n-to-1 or n-to-m alignments (Fluhr, Bisson
and Elkateb, 2000) and to cope with the problem of
linguistic variation and non correspondence across
languages, for instance when aligning terms
(Gaussier, 2001).

We take as a starting point the hypothesis
formulated by Debili and Zribi (1996) according to
which “paradigmatic connections can help to
determine syntagmatic relations, and conversely”1.
More precisely, the idea is that one can make use
of syntactic relations to validate or invalidate the
existence of alignment links, on the one hand, and

to create new ones, on the other hand. The
reasoning is as follows : if there is a pair of anchor
words, i.e. if two words w1i (community in the
example) and w2m (communauté) are aligned at the
sentence level, and if there is a syntactic relation
standing between w1i (community) and w1j (ban)
on the one hand, and between w2m (communauté)
and w2n (interdire) on the other hand, then the
alignment link is propagated from the anchor pair
(community, communauté) to the words (ban,
interdire). We call this procedure “alignment by
syntactic propagation”.

In the rest of this article, we describe the overall
design and implementation of the syntactic

INRA and JOC.

4 Corpus processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998655127272728">
The alignment by syntactic propagation was
tested on two different parallel corpora aligned at
the sentence level: INRA and JOC. The first
corpus was constituted at the National Institute for
Agricultural Research (INRA)2 to enrich a
bilingual terminology database exploited by
translators. It comprises about 300,000 words and
mainly consists of research and popular-science
papers, press releases.
The JOC corpus was provided by the ARCADE
project, a campaign devoted to the evaluation of
parallel text alignment systems (Veronis and
Langlais, 2000). It contains written questions on a
wide variety of topics addressed by members of the
European Parliament to the European Commission
and corresponding answers published by the
Official Journal of the European Community in
nine official languages. A portion of about 400,000
words of the French and English parts were used in
the framework of the ARCADE evaluation task.
The corpus processing was carried out by a
French/English parser: SYNTEX (Bourigault and
Fabre, 2000; Frérot, Fabre and Bourigault, 2003).
SYNTEX is a dependency parser whose input is a
2 We are grateful to A. Lacombe who allowed us to use
this corpus for research purposes.
POS tagged3 corpus–meaning each word in the
corpus is assigned a lemma and grammatical tag.
The parser identifies syntactic dependencies in the
sentences of a given corpus, for instance subjects,
direct and indirect objects of verbs. Once all
syntactic dependencies have been identified, a set
of words and phrases is extracted out of the corpus.
Both versions of the parser–the French one and
the English one–are being developed according to
the same procedures and architecture. The parsing
is performed independently in each language, yet
the outputs are quite homogeneous since the
syntactic dependencies are identified and
represented in the same way in both languages. In
this respect, the alignment method proposed is
different from the ones developed by Wu (2000) as
well as Lin and Cherry (2003): the former is based
on synchronous parsing while the letter uses a
dependency tree generated only in the source
language.
In addition to parsed French/English corpus
aligned at the sentence level, the syntactic
alignment requires pairs of anchor words be
identified prior to propagation as to start the
process. In this study, we chose to extract a lexicon
out of the corpus, the anchor pairs being located
both by projecting the lexicon at the level of
aligned sentences and processing the identical and
fuzzy cognates.

5 Identification of anchor pairs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998722882352941">
To derive a list of words which are likely to be
used to initiate the syntactic propagation process
out of the corpus, we implemented a widely used
method described notably in (Gale and Church,
1991; Ahrenberg, Andersson and Merkel, 2000)
which is based on the assumption that the words
which appear frequently in aligned text segments
are potential translation equivalents. For each
source (English) and target (French) unit,
respectively u1 and u2, extracted by SYNTEX, the
translation equivalents are searched for by
counting co-occurrences of (u1, u2) in aligned
sentences in comparison with their overall
occurrences in the corpus and then an association
score is computed. In this study, we chose the
Jaccard association score which is calculated as
follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998183333333333">
f(u1, u2)
j(u1, u2) =
f(u1) + f(u2) – f(u1, u2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999032">
The association score is computed provided the
number of overall occurrences of u1 and u2 is
higher than 4 since statistical techniques have
proved to be particularly efficient when aligning
frequent units. Moreover, the alignments are
filtered according to the j(u1, u2) value, provided
the latter is higher than 0.2. Then, two tests, based
on cognate recognition and mutual correspondence
condition (Altenberg, 1999), are applied as to filter
spurious associations out of the initial lexicon.
The identification of anchor pairs, consisting of
words which are translation equivalents within
aligned sentences, combines both the projection of
the initial lexicon and the recognition of cognates
for words which have not been taken into account
in the lexicon. These pairs are used as the starting
point of the propagation process.
Table 1 gives some characteristics of the two
corpora as for the number of aligned sentences, the
overall number of anchor pairs identified, the
average number of anchor pairs per sentence pair
as well as the precision rate4 of the anchor pairs. It
can be seen that a high number of anchor pairs has
been identified per sentence for both corpora with
a high accuracy.

6.1 Two types of propagation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978808666666667">
The syntactic propagation may be performed
according to two different directions. Indeed, a
given word is likely to be both governor and
dependent with respect to other words. The first
direction consists in starting with dependent anchor
words and propagating the alignment link to the
governors (DepGov propagation). The DepGov
propagation is a priori not ambiguous since one
dependent is governed at most by one word. Thus,
there is just one syntactic relation on which the
propagation can be based. The syntactic structures
are said to be parallel in English and French
provided the two following conditions are met: i)
the relation under consideration is identical in both
languages and ii) the words involved in the

Treetagger. (http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de) 4 The precision was evaluated manually
syntactic propagation have the same POS. The
second direction goes the opposite way: starting
with governor anchor words, the alignment link is
propagated to the dependents (GovDep
propagation). In this case, several relations which
may be used to achieve the propagation are
available, as it is possible for a governor to have
more than one dependent, and so the propagation is
potentially ambiguous. The ambiguity is
particularly widespread when performing the
GovDep propagation from head nouns to their
nominal and adjectival dependents. Let us consider
the example (1). There is one occurrence of the
relation PREP in English and two in French. Thus,
it is not possible to determine a priori whether to
propagate using the relations NN/PREP2, on the one
hand, and PREP1/PREP2’, on the other hand, or
NN/PREP2’ and PREP1/PREP2. Moreover, even if
there is just one occurrence of the same relation in
each language, it does not mean that the
propagation is of necessity performed through the
same relation, as shown in example (2).

In the following sections, we describe precisely
the implementation of the two types of propagation
defined above in order to align verbs (section 6.2),
on the one hand, and nouns and adjectives, on the
other hand (section 6.3). To this, we rely on
different propagation patterns. Propagation
patterns are given in the form CDep-REL-CGov,
where CDep is the POS of the dependent, REL is
the syntactic relation and CGov, the POS of the
governor. The anchor element is underlined and
the one aligned by propagation is bolded. For
instance, the pattern N-SUJ-V corresponds to the

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.952553711111111">
As for verbs, the two types of propagation
described in section 6.1 are used to align adjectives
and nouns. However, as far as these categories of
words are concerned, they can’t be treated in a
fully independent way when propagating from
head noun anchor words in order to align the
dependents. Indeed, the syntactic structure of noun
phrases may be different in English and French,
since they rely on a different type of composition
to produce compounds and on the same one to
produce free noun phrases (Chuquet and Paillard,
1989). Then the potential ambiguity arising from
the GovDep propagation from head nouns evoked
in section 6.1 may be accompanied by variation
phenomena affecting the category of the
dependents, called transposition (Vinay and
Darbelnet, 1958; Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). For
instance, a noun may be rendered by an adjective,
or vice versa: tax treatment profits is translated by
traitement fiscal des bénéfices, so the noun tax is in
correspondence with the adjective fiscal. The
syntactic relations used to propagate the alignment
links are thus different.
In order to cope with the variation problem, the
propagation is performed whether the syntactic
relations are identical in both languages or not, and
if they are not, whether the categories of the words
to be aligned are the same or not. To sum up,
adjectives and nouns are aligned separately of each
other by means of DepGov propagation or GovDep
propagation provided that the governor is not a
noun. They are not treated separately when
aligning by means of GovDep propagation from
head noun anchor pairs.

possible to align words using different syntactic
relations in both languages, even though the

INRA corpus and 93.1% for the JOC – assessed
respectively against a reference list of
approximately 8000 and 4600 alignments.
Various reasons make it difficult to compare the
results of this experiment with those reported in the
literature and presented in section 2. Indeed, each
approach has been tested on a different corpus and
the results achieved could depend on the type of
texts used for evaluation purposes. Moreover, the
reference alignment lists, i.e. the gold standards,
have probably been established according to
different annotation criteria, which could also
influence the quality of the results. Finally, each
system has been designed, or at least used, to
perform a specific task and evaluated in this
respect. Daille, Gaussier and Langé (1994), as well
as Gaussier (1998) and Hull (2001), were
interested in bilingual terminology extraction so
that word alignment could not be considered as an
end in itself but rather as a basis for term
alignment. The system proposed by Wu (2000)
aims at bilingual language modelling, word and
phrase alignment is incorporated as a subtask.
Finally, Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel (2000)
as well as Lin and Cherry (2003) addressed the
problem of full word alignment without restricting
themselves to content words. Both noticed that the
integration of linguistic knowledge, morphological
and lexical for the former, syntactic for the latter,
improves the alignment quality. However,
concerning the approach proposed by Lin and
Cherry (2003), it should be pointed out that
linguistic knowledge is considered secondary to
statistical information. As regards the alignment by
syntactic propagation, linguistic knowledge is the
kernel of the approach rather than an additional
information.
The propagation of alignments links using
syntactic relations has proved very efficient when
the same propagation pattern is used in both
languages, i.e. when the syntactic structures are
identical. A high level of precision is also achieved
in the case of noun/adjective transpositions, even if
the category of the words to be aligned varies. We
are actually pursuing the study of non-
correspondence between syntactic structures in
English and French outlined in (Ozdowska and
Bourigault, 2004). The aim is to determine whether
there are some regularities in rendering certain
English structures into certain French ones or not.
If variation across languages is subjected to such
regularities, the syntactic propagation could then
be extended to the cases of non correspondence.

Both corpora are analysed with a deep and robust parser. Starting with an anchor pair consisting of two words which are potential translations of one another within aligned sentences, the alignment link is propagated to the syntactically connected words.

In this study, we chose the Jaccard association score which is calculated as follows: f(u1, u2) j(u1, u2) = f(u1) + f(u2) – f(u1, u2) The association score is computed provided the number of overall occurrences of u1 and u2 is higher than 4 since statistical techniques have proved to be particularly efficient when aligning frequent units. Moreover, the alignments are filtered according to the j(u1, u2) value, provided the latter is higher than 0.2. Then, two tests, based on cognate recognition and mutual correspondence condition (Altenberg, 1999), are applied as to filter spurious associations out of the initial lexicon. The identification of anchor pairs, consisting of words which are translation equivalents within aligned sentences, combines both the projection of the initial lexicon and the recognition of cognates for words which have not been taken into account in the lexicon. These pairs are used as the starting point of the propagation process.

However, as far as these categories of words are concerned, they can’t be treated in a fully independent way when propagating from head noun anchor words in order to align the dependents. Indeed, the syntactic structure of noun phrases may be different in English and French, since they rely on a different type of composition to produce compounds and on the same one to produce free noun phrases (Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). Then the potential ambiguity arising from the GovDep propagation from head nouns evoked in section 6.1 may be accompanied by variation phenomena affecting the category of the dependents, called transposition (Vinay and Darbelnet, 1958; Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). For instance, a noun may be rendered by an adjective, or vice versa: tax treatment profits is translated by traitement fiscal des bénéfices, so the noun tax is in correspondence with the adjective fiscal. The syntactic relations used to propagate the alignment links are thus different. In order to cope with the variation problem, t</context>

Several works have focused on the alignment of units which are smaller than a sentence, for instance words or phrases, as to produce bilingual word, phrase or term associations. A common assumption is that the alignment of words or phrases raises a real challenge, since it is “neither one-to-one, nor sequential, nor compact”, and thus “the correspondences are fuzzy and contextual” (Debili, 1997). Indeed, it is even often diffult for a human to determine which source unit correspond to which target unit within aligned sentences (Och and Ney, 2003). Most alignment systems working on parallel corpora rely on statistical models, in particular the EM ones (Brown, Della Pietra and Mercer, 1993). Quite recently attempts have been made in order to incorporate different types of linguistic information sources into word and phrase alignment systems. The idea is to take into account the specific problems arising from the alignment at the word or phrase level mentioned in particular by Debili (1</context>

More precisely, the idea is that one can make use of syntactic relations to validate or invalidate the existence of alignment links, on the one hand, and 1Our translation of the French version « les liaisons paradigmatiques peuvent aider à déterminer les relations syntagmatiques, et inversement ». to create new ones, on the other hand.

For each source (English) and target (French) unit, respectively u1 and u2, extracted by SYNTEX, the translation equivalents are searched for by counting co-occurrences of (u1, u2) in aligned sentences in comparison with their overall occurrences in the corpus and then an association score is computed.

We call this procedure “alignment by syntactic propagation”. 2 State of the art 2.1 Term alignment Two kinds of methods have been basically proposed in order to address the problem of bilingual lexicon extraction. On the one hand, terms are recognized in both source and target language and then they are mapped to each other (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994). On the other hand, only source terms are extracted and the target ones are discovered through the alignment process (Gaussier, 1998; Hull, 2001). The alignment between terms is obtained either by computing association probabilities (Gaussier, 1998 ; Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994) or by identifying, for a given source term, a sequence of words in the target language which is likely to contain or to correspond to its translation (Hull, 2001). In so far as the precision rate may be affected by the number of alignments obtained (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994; Gaussier, 1998), the results achieved basically range between 80% and 90%, for the first 500 alignments.

We chose this approach in order to achieve a high accuracy alignment both at word and phrase level. Indeed, we aim at capturing frequent alignments between words and phrases as well as those involving sparse or corpus specific ones. Moreover, as stressed in previous works, using syntactic dependencies seems to be particularly well suited to solve n-to-1 or n-to-m alignments (Fluhr, Bisson and Elkateb, 2000) and to cope with the problem of linguistic variation and non correspondence across languages, for instance when aligning terms (Gaussier, 2001). 3 Starting hypothesis We take as a starting point the hypothesis formulated by Debili and Zribi (1996) according to which “paradigmatic connections can help to determine syntagmatic relations, and conversely”1. More precisely, the idea is that one can make use of syntactic relations to validate or invalidate the existence of alignment links, on the one hand, and 1Our translation of the French version « les liaisons paradigmatiques peuvent aider à déterminer les relations syntagmatiques, et inversement ». to create new ones, on the other hand. The reasoning is as follows : if there is a pair </context>

We call this procedure “alignment by syntactic propagation”. 2 State of the art 2.1 Term alignment Two kinds of methods have been basically proposed in order to address the problem of bilingual lexicon extraction. On the one hand, terms are recognized in both source and target language and then they are mapped to each other (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994). On the other hand, only source terms are extracted and the target ones are discovered through the alignment process (Gaussier, 1998; Hull, 2001). The alignment between terms is obtained either by computing association probabilities (Gaussier, 1998 ; Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994) or by identifying, for a given source term, a sequence of words in the target language which is likely to contain or to correspond to its translation (Hull, 2001). In so far as the precision rate may be affected by the number of alignments obtained (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994; Gaussier, 1998), the results achieved basically range between 80% and 90%, for the first 500 alignments. As for the method described in (Hull, 2001), the precison reported is 5</context>

Indeed, each approach has been tested on a different corpus and the results achieved could depend on the type of texts used for evaluation purposes. Moreover, the reference alignment lists, i.e. the gold standards, have probably been established according to different annotation criteria, which could also influence the quality of the results. Finally, each system has been designed, or at least used, to perform a specific task and evaluated in this respect. Daille, Gaussier and Langé (1994), as well as Gaussier (1998) and Hull (2001), were interested in bilingual terminology extraction so that word alignment could not be considered as an end in itself but rather as a basis for term alignment. The system proposed by Wu (2000) aims at bilingual language modelling, word and phrase alignment is incorporated as a subtask. Finally, Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel (2000) as well as Lin and Cherry (2003) addressed the problem of full word alignment without restricting themselves to content words.

Several works have focused on the alignment of units which are smaller than a sentence, for instance words or phrases, as to produce bilingual word, phrase or term associations. A common assumption is that the alignment of words or phrases raises a real challenge, since it is “neither one-to-one, nor sequential, nor compact”, and thus “the correspondences are fuzzy and contextual” (Debili, 1997). Indeed, it is even often diffult for a human to determine which source unit correspond to which target unit within aligned sentences (Och and Ney, 2003). Most alignment systems working on parallel corpora rely on statistical models, in particular the EM ones (Brown, Della Pietra and Mercer, 1993). Quite recently attempts have been made in order to incorporate different types of linguistic information sources into word and phrase alignment systems. The idea is to take into account the specific problems arising from the alignment at the word or phrase level mentioned in particular by Debili (1997). Different types of linguistic knowledge are exploited: morphological, lexical and syntactic ones. In the method described in this article, the synta</context>

Indeed, the syntactic structure of noun phrases may be different in English and French, since they rely on a different type of composition to produce compounds and on the same one to produce free noun phrases (Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). Then the potential ambiguity arising from the GovDep propagation from head nouns evoked in section 6.1 may be accompanied by variation phenomena affecting the category of the dependents, called transposition (Vinay and Darbelnet, 1958; Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). For instance, a noun may be rendered by an adjective, or vice versa: tax treatment profits is translated by traitement fiscal des bénéfices, so the noun tax is in correspondence with the adjective fiscal. The syntactic relations used to propagate the alignment links are thus different. In order to cope with the variation problem, the propagation is performed whether the syntactic relations are identical in both languages or not, and if they are not, whether the categories of the words to be aligned are the same or not. To sum up, adjectives and nouns are aligned </context>
