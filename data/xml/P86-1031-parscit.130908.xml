ABSTRACT&apos;
A constraint is proposed in the Centering
approach to pronoun resolution in discourse. This
&amp;quot;property-sharing&amp;quot; constraint requires that two
pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb
across adjacent utterances share a certain
common grammatical property. This property is
expressed along the dimension of the
grammatical function SUBJECT for both
Japanese and English discourses, where different
pronominal forms are primarily used to realize
the Cb. It is the zero pronominal in Japanese, and
the (unstressed) overt pronoun in English. The
resulting constraint complements the original
Centering, accounting for its apparent violations
and providing a solution to the interpretation of
multi-pronominal utterances. It also provides an
alternative account of anaphora interpretation
that appears to be due to structural parallelism.
This reconciliation of centering/focusing and
parallelism is a major advantage. I will then add
another dimension called the &amp;quot;speaker
identification&amp;quot; to the constraint to handle a group
of special cases in Japanese discourse. It
indicates a close association between centering
and the speaker&apos;s viewpoint, and sheds light on
what underlies the effect of perception reports on
pronoun resolution in general. These results, by
drawing on facts in two very different languages,
demonstrate the cross-linguistic applicability of
the centering framework.
using this notion.2
Centers are semantic objects--(sets of) individuals,
objects, states, actions, or events--represented in complex
ways so that a strict coreference need not hold between
anaphorically related terms.3 A center mentioned in the
current utterance may be mentioned again in the next
utterance (by the same or a different speaker). In this sense,
a center is &amp;quot;forward-looking&amp;quot; (Cf). Crucially, one of the
centers may be identified as &amp;quot;backward-looking&amp;quot; (Cb). Cb
is the entity an utterance most centrally concerns. Its main
role is to connect the current utterance to the preceding
one(s).4 The term the Center is also used for the Cb. Thus
an utterance may be associated with any number of Cfs,
one of which may be the Cb. These Cfs are given a default
expected Cb order, that is, &amp;quot;how much each center is
expected to be the next Cb&amp;quot;. I regard Cb to be optional for
an utterance.5 It comes into exsistence by way of a
Cb-establishment process, that is, the process in which a
previous non-Cb becomes the new Cb in discourse.
Sidner&apos;s (1981, 1983) immediate focus and potential foci in
local focusing correspond to Cb and Cfs, respectively. The
difference is that Sidner uses two immediate foci
(Discourse Focus and Actor Focus) while centering uses
only one (Cb) (see Grosz et. al. 1983 for discussion).
Various factors --syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic--
are combined for the identification of the Cb. One of them
is the use of pronominal expressions, as expressed in the

Grosz, Joshi, &amp; Weinstein (1983) postulated that each
utterance in discourse concerns a set of entities called the
centers, and discussed how certain facts of local discourse
connectedness (as opposed to global) can be accounted for

2In a theory of discourse structure that consists of three
interacting components, linguistic, intentional, and
attentional (Grosz &amp; Sidner 1985), centers are found in the
local attentional structure.

4The notion of centering originally comes from Joshi &amp;
Weinstein (1981).
5We can view Cb either optional or obligatory for each
utterance. The difference seems more conceptual than
substantial since what is crucial for providing a referent
candidate is the expected Cb order given to the Cf set
whether this set contains the Cb or not. Relative merits of
each approach should be clarified in the future.

original Centering rule (Grosz et. al. 1983):6

Cb of the previous utterance, a pronoun should be used.

It is assumed that an equivalent interpretation heuristic is
used by a hearer. Roughly, a pronoun &amp;quot;realizes&amp;quot; the current
Cb that continues the previous Cb.&apos;
In this paper, I will first point out certain facts that the
basic Centering rule does not explain, then propose a
further constraint that substantiates the basic rule. This is
called the &amp;quot;property-sharing&amp;quot; constraint, which requires
that two pronominal elements realizing the same Cb in
adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical
property. This shared property itself is expressed as a
default preference order reflecting the nature of the
constraint as a discourse rule. The initial formulation of the
constraint only refers to the grammatical function
SUBJECT. It explains the problem cases for the basic
Centering rule in Japanese and English. It also accounts for
a subset of what appears to be an effect of structural
parallelism in anaphora interpretation. Then I will propose
an additional dimension of the shared property called the
&amp;quot;speaker identification&amp;quot; property. The revised constraint
referring to both dimensions accounts for a group of
counterexamples to the initial formulation found in
Japanese discourse. It also sheds light on what is involved
in interpreting perception reports in both languages.
Before starting the discussion, I would like to comment
on the nature of the data used here. I will mostly use
constructed discourse sequences where the role played by
commonsense inferences or special linguistic devices (such
as stress and intonation) for guiding pronoun
interpretations is minimal. All examples in this paper are to
be read with flat intonation with unstressed pronouns.
These limitations are in order to identify the
grammatically-based default order that gives rise to
preferred interpretations in neutral contexts. Note that this
default order alone does not determine interpretations of
pronominal elements. Rather, its role in the centering
framework is to give an ordered list of referents (centers)
so that commonsense inferences can be controlled.
Interpretations and acceptability judgements of the
examples in this paper result from interviews withâ€¢ a
number of native speakers in each language.

In Japanese, the expression primarily used to realize the
Cb is the zero pronominal (i.e., unexpressed subject or
object).8 The grammatical features (e.g., gender, number,
person) of these unexpressed subjects and objects are not
morphologically marked elsewhere in the sentence, which
distinguishes them from the so-called &amp;quot;pm-drop&amp;quot;, such as
the unexpressed finite clause subject in Italian and Spanish
whose grammatical features are morphologically marked
on the verb inflection. The basic Centering rule in Japanese
can be obtained by changing the word pronoun to zero
pronominal in (1) (Kameyama 1985).
In the following discourse fragment, it is reasonable to
assume that Rosa is the Cb of the second utterance:9

It seems equally reasonable to assume that Rosa is the

If the Cb-status of an entity is homogeneous, we would
expect that the two instances of the Cb above have exactly
the same effect, if any, on the subsequent utterance. When
an identical third utterance is added to both, however, it
becomes clear that the centered individual Rosa is not of an
equal status in the two cases:
6Grosz et. al. (in preparation) propose various constraints
on this rule, and, among other things, distinguish between
the retention and continuation of the Cb. I will use the
words retain and continue in non-technical sense in this
paper.
7An expression realizes a center rather than denoting it.
Realization allows either a value-free or value-loaded
interpretation (see Grosz et. al. 1983 for discussion).

Vietnamese, Thai, etc. I will also call them &amp;quot;zero-subject&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;zero-object&amp;quot;, and so on.

markers in the gloss: SB (subject), OB (direct object), 02

The extension (4) is a multi-zero-pronominal utterance.
The zero-subject and zero-object pronominals receive
reverse interpretations depending on whether the utterance
follows (2) or (3). Although this fact by itself does not
contradict the basic rule (1), it poses a question as to which
zero pronominal in (4) realizes its Cb. There are the
following two possibilities. If the previous Cb continues to
be the current Cb by default, it follows that the choice of
the Cb-realizing zero pronominal depends entirely on the
preceding discourse context. On the other hand, if some
inherent property of a zero pronominal (e.g., subject/object)
independently decides which one realizes the Cb, the
previous context need not be considered. For instance, if a
zero-subject is always more closely associated with the Cb
than a zero-object, the discourse sequence (3) to (4)
changes the Cb from Rosa to Mary.
In the extension (5), Rosa (the previous Cb) is
mentioned with a full name while the single zero
pronominal picks out a previous non-Cb, Mary. If Rosa is
still the Cb here, this utterance violates the basic Centering
rule, so the rule predicts unacceptability, which is indeed
the case following the sequence (2).n The same rule,
however, provides no clue for the puzzling acceptability of
the same extension following the sequence (3). Moreover,
it is possible that Rosa is no longer the Cb in (5), in which
case, rule (1) simply does not apply.
Examples like these are the basis for the first version of
the Centering Constraint:
(6) Centering Constraint [Japanese] (1st approximation)
Two zero pronominals that retain the same Cb in adjacent
utterances should share one of the following properties:
SUBJECT or nonSUBJECT.12
(6) says that two zero pronominals supporting the same
Cb in adjacent utterances should both be either SUBJECT
or nonSUBJECT. In the case of discourse extension (4)
above, if the Cb is still Rosa, it should be realized with a
zero-subject after the sequence (2) and with a zero-object
after (3). This is shown below:

<listItem confidence="0.9830175">

2. [Cb&lt;OBJ&gt; . Rosa] &lt;â€”(4) [weak preference]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989757678571428">
I attribute the different degree of preference between (7)
and (8) to the difference in canonicality of centering. A Cb
continued with zero-subjects as in (7) is more stable, or
more canonical, than one continued with zero-objects as in
(8), which is but one manifestation of the overall
significance of SUBJECT in centering.13 This leads to the
second approximation of the Centering Constraint:
(9) Centering Constraint [Japanese] (2nd
approximation)
Two zero pronominals that retain the same Cb in adjacent
utterances should share one of the following properties (in
descending order of preference): 1) SUBJECT, 2)
nonSUBJECT.
Constraint (9) predicts that retaining a Cb is good when
the two pronominals are both either SUBJECT or
nonSUBJECT while it is bad (i.e., leading to complex
inferences) when one is SUBJECT and the other is not.
This in turn predicts that changing the Cb across adjacent
utterances is acceptable when the two pronominals have
different properties while it is not when they are of the
same property.
The difference in acceptability between sequence (2) to
(5) (marginal) and sequence (3) to (5) (acceptable) would
then follow from this constraint. The former is bad because
it changes the Cb with two SUBJECT zero pronominals, as
shown in (10). The latter is good because it changes the Cb
with different zero pronominals (from OBJECT to
SUBJECT), as shown in (11):

The evaluation of the third utterance parallels the
Japanese example. This indicates that the SUBJECT-based
constraint stated in (9) for Japanese is applicable to English
together with all the analogous consequences discussed
above. The constraint is restated below for pronominal
expressions in general:
(15) Centering Constraint [general] (approximation)
Two pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb in
adjacent utterances should share one of the following
properties (in descending order of preference): 1)
SUBJECT, 2) nonSUBJECT.
The particular kind of pronominal expressions relevant
here vary from language to language. Kameyama (1985:
Ch.1) hypothesized that it is the pronominal element with
the &amp;quot;less phonetic content&amp;quot; for each grammatical function
of a language14 and that it is predictable from the
typological perspective on available pronominal forms. For
instance, it is the unstressed pronoun in English where
pronouns must always be overt, and it is the zero
pronominal in Japanese where pronouns with no phonetic
14/t is possible that only certain grammatical functions
(e.g., SUBJECT, OBJECT, and OBJECT2) are relavant to
the Cb. This will have to be clarified in the future.
content exist (for subjects and objects). It is further
predicted that morphologically bound pronominal forms
(i.e., agreement inflections, elides, and affixes) rather than
full independent pronouns are used for Cb-realization if a
language has this option. For instance, this option exists for
the finite clause subject in Italian and Spanish in terms of
the agreement inflection, and for the fmite clause subject
and object in Warlpiri in terms of clitics. The constraint in
English is stated below:
(16) Centering Constraint [English]
Two unstressed pronouns that retain the same Cb in
adjacent utterances should share one of the following
properties (in descending order of preference): 1)
SUBJECT, 2) nonSUBJECT.
23. Accounting for the effect of parallelism in
Cb-establishment
The given property-sharing constraint has so far been
proposed for pronominal elements that retain the same Cb
in adjacent utterances. By its reference to the grammatical
property SUBJECT, the constraint indicates that adjacent
utterances of the same Cb cohere even better when there is
a certain degree of grammatical parallelism.
Analogous constraints account for at least two other
kinds of parallelism effects on pronoun interpretation in
English. They are in the context of what I call the
Cb-establishment, that is, the process in which a previous
non-Cb becomes the Cb. The case of Cb-shift is a subcase
of Cb-establishment.15
Ambiguous multi-pronouns. The first is the
interpretation of a multi-pronominal utterance that
establishes a Cb. An example follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9706125">
(17)
1. Max is waiting for Fred.
2. He invited him to dinner.
[preference: Max invited Fred]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9691150625">
(17) shows that when two pronouns are potentially
ambiguous in reference, the preferred interpretation
conforms to a property-sharing constraint. That is, there is
a higher tendency that the SUBJECT pronoun corefers with
the SUBJECT of the previous utterance.
It is crucial here that (a) there is more than one pronoun
and (b) two (or more) of them are potentially ambiguous
(i.e., of the same grammatical features). Otherwise, the
process of Cb-establishment need not be constrained by the
15In the present approach, the default &amp;quot;expected Cb&amp;quot; is
the (matrix) SUBJECT referent, and the Cb is established
in the next utterance with a (matrix) (SUBJECT) pronoun,
if there is one. More factors such as TOPIC (wa-marking)
and Ident (see below) are also relevant to the centering in
Japanese. These are discussed in the longer paper in
preparation.

property-sharing, as illustrated in the following examples:

<bodyText confidence="0.988810833333333">
(18)-2 has only one pronoun and (19)-2 has two
pronouns with different gender. In both cases, the
nonSUBJECT pronoun naturally corefers with the previous
SUBJECT. The property-sharing constraint becomes
relevant only in the case of completely ambiguous multi-
pronouns as in (17). Note that this in turn explains why the
property-sharing was first recognized for zero pronominals,
which lack gender/number/person distinctions altogether.
Explicitly signalled parallelism. The second relevant
type of parallelism effect is found in a discourse sequence
with explicit linguistic signals for a parallel structure.
Examples follow:

<listItem confidence="0.983826111111111">

2. The wild violet is found near it too.

<bodyText confidence="0.999806105263158">
Parallelisms in (20) and (21) are clearly signalled with
(i) the same verbal expressions (talk to and be found near)
and (ii) the word too. In such cases, a version of the
property-sharing scheme would propose the correct
specification of the single pronoun as the first choice. Since
the pronouns are nonSUBJECT&apos;, they should co-specify
with the nonSUBJECT in the first utterance, which are Tom
and the wild rose, respectively.I6
Significant here is the fact that (21) was a problem case
for Sidner&apos;s (1979) focusing-based pronoun interpretation
algorithm. She in fact concluded that pronoun
interpretation involving structural parallelism was a source
for anaphora inherently different from focusing:
&amp;quot;Focussing cannot account for the detection of
parallel structure, not only because the
computation of such structure is poorly
understood, but also because focussing chooses
different defaults for co-specification than those
required for parallelism.&amp;quot; (p.236)

default expected Cb, the &amp;quot;green Whitierleaf&apos; (SUBJECT),

effects of both focusing/centering and structural

<bodyText confidence="0.986338064516129">
Although correct in most cases, the Centering Constraint
as stated in (9) is systematically violated by a certain group
of counterexamples in Japanese. This has to do with what
Kuno calls empathy, a grammatical feature especially
prominent in Japanese, defined as follows:
(22) Empathy (Kuno &amp; Kaburagi 1977:628)
Empathy is the speaker&apos;s identification, with varying
degrees, with a person who participates in the event that he
describes in a sentence.
I will call it the speaker identification, or simply,
identification.Â° When the main predicate of an utterance
selects one of its arguments for the identification locus
(henceforth Ident), the speaker automatically identifies
(with varying degrees) with the viewpoint of its referent
(usually human). The unmarked Ident is the SUBJECT, but
some verbs have nonSUBJECT Ident For instance, among
giving/receiving verbs, ageru &apos;give&apos; and morau &apos;receive&apos;
have SUBJECT &apos;dent while kureru &apos;give&apos; has OBJECT2
Ident,I8 and for going/coming verbs, &amp;a &apos;go&apos; has
SUBJECT Ident while kuru &apos;come&apos; has nonSUBJECT
Ident. Each Ident feature is carried over in a complex
predicate made with one of these verbs as the &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot;
predicate (e.g., V-kureru &apos;give the favor of V-ing&apos;
Ident=nonSUBJ).
Counterexamples to the constraint stated in (9) are cases
with verbs of nonSUBJECT Ident
I7&amp;quot;Identification&amp;quot; is a better term than &amp;quot;empathy&amp;quot; in
conveying the lack of speaker&apos;s emotional involvement
and, moreover, it was used in the original definition of
empathy in (22). The basic characterization of this notion is
fully credited to Kuno and Kaburagi, however.

The preferred reading of (23)-3 shows that the
zero-Ident-OBJ2 is preferred over the
zero-nonIdent-SUBJ for carrying over the Cb previously
realized with a zero-Ident-SUBJ. In other words, when
Ident and SUBJECT are split, Ident overrides SUBJECT as
the stronger shared property for the zero pronominals that
retain the same Cb across adjacent utterances.
Based on the interpretation of various SUBJ/Ident
combinations (see Kameyama 1985 Ch.2 for more details),
the constraint is restated as follows:19

Ident alone, 3) SUBJECT alone, 4)
nonldent-nonSUBJECT.
The resulting constraint substantiates the role of the zero
pronominal in the context of centering in Japanese
discourse. The constraint in English need not incorporate
the Ident property, however. According to Kuno &amp;
Kaburagi (ibid.), there is only a handful of verbs with
SUBJECT Ident (e.g., marry, meet, run into, hear from,
receive from) and only one with nonSUBJECT Ident (come
up to), none of which propagate with an operation like the
Japanese complex verb formation. Moreover, even using
these verbs, the Ident effect on pronoun interpretation is not
19Implicit here are two weakest properties to be shared:
5) nonIdent alone and 6) nonSUBJECT alone. These
were left out because of the scarcity of actual instances in
discourse. I found, however, that exactly the same scale of
shared properties accounts for the possibility of the
intra-sentential zero pronominal binding in Japanese, and
that the full scale of six properties is actually needed for it
(see Kameyama 1986).
at all clear in English.&amp;quot;
The lack (or dispensability) of the speaker identification
constraint does not mean that English centering is less
constrained, because English pronouns are inherently more
constrained than Japanese zero pronominals by the
presence of grammatical features, gender, number, and
person. We can view the Ident feature of Japanese zero
pronominals as a way to make up for the lack of
gender/number/person information available in overt
pronouns. The SUBJECT constraint stated in (16), which is
simply a subpart of the constraint in Japanese, thus remains
adequate in English.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.747079666666667">
Perception verbs like see/hear, look/sound, etc. anchor
the speaker&apos;s perspective just like Japanese Ident verbs.
For example:

1. Dan went to a party yesterday.
2. He saw his high school friend Jim.

Equivalent sequences in Japanese give rise to the same
interpretation, that is, the single pronominal element in the
third utterance picks out the previous non-Cb. This
exceptional case can be explained if verbs like look and
sound are used to describe states perceived from the
viewpoint of the individual the speaker currently &apos;identifies
with&apos;. As a consequence, the SUBJECT referent of such a
description is typically other than the one currently
identified with. By making the previous Cb &amp;quot;the individual
the speaker currently identifies with&amp;quot;, the preferred
readings of (25)-3 and (26)-3 can be explained. This
indicates that the speaker&apos;s viewpoint is closely related to
the Cb whether or not there is an Ident-based constraint in

3. He came up to him and shook his hand.
&lt;Ident=nonSUBJ&gt;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974436">
The third utterance should read &amp;quot;Peter came up to John&amp;quot;

interpretation, however, showing the preference for the
SUBJ-SUBJ coreference.

Although there is a close relationship between Ident and
these perception reports, the &apos;grammatical&apos; status of the
latter is not very clear. In particular, it is questionable
whether the effect of perception verbs should be
differentiated from commonsense-based interpretations as
in the following example: Sam hit Bill on the head. He hit
him back on the chin. It is an area open for more detailed
studies in the future.

4. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968514285714">
Within the framework of the Centering approach to
pronoun resolution in discourse, I have proposed an
additional constraint for Japanese and English. This
property-sharing constraint requires that two pronominal
expressions that retain the same Cb across adjacent
utterances share a certain common grammatical property.
This property has been identified in two dimensions. One
has to do with the grammatical function SUBJECT, and the
other has to do with the speaker identification property
Ident. The latter is necessary for Japanese discourse where
the primary Cb-realizer is the zero pronominal, but not for
English discourse where it is the (unstressed) overt
pronoun. The resulting constraint complements the
original Centering rule, accounting for its apparent
violations and providing a solution to the interpretation of
multi-pronominal utterances.
Two significant implications of the proposed constraint
have been discussed. First, the SUBJECT constraint
provides an alternative account of anaphora interpretation
that appears to be due to structural parallelism. This
reconciliation of centering/focusing and parallelism is a
major advantage of this constraint. Second, the speaker
identification constraint found in Japanese indicates a close
association between centering and the speaker&apos;s viewpoint.
In particular, it sheds light on what underlies the effect of
perception reports on pronoun resolution. These results, by
drawing on facts in two very different languages,
demonstrate the cross-linguistic applicability of the
centering framework in general.
The present property-sharing constraint highlights a
grammatical aspect that contributes to local discourse
coherence. It will be integrated into the default rules which,
by ordering the candidate referents for a pronominal
expression, control the pragmatic inferences involved in
pronoun resolution.

<abstract confidence="0.9978475">A constraint is proposed in the Centering approach to pronoun resolution in discourse. This &amp;quot;property-sharing&amp;quot; constraint requires that two pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb across adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical property. This property is expressed along the dimension of the grammatical function SUBJECT for both Japanese and English discourses, where different pronominal forms are primarily used to realize the Cb. It is the zero pronominal in Japanese, and the (unstressed) overt pronoun in English. The resulting constraint complements the original Centering, accounting for its apparent violations and providing a solution to the interpretation of multi-pronominal utterances. It also provides an alternative account of anaphora interpretation that appears to be due to structural parallelism. This reconciliation of centering/focusing and parallelism is a major advantage. I will then add another dimension called the &amp;quot;speaker identification&amp;quot; to the constraint to handle a group of special cases in Japanese discourse. It indicates a close association between centering and the speaker&apos;s viewpoint, and sheds light on what underlies the effect of perception reports on pronoun resolution in general. These results, by drawing on facts in two very different languages, demonstrate the cross-linguistic applicability of the centering framework. this Centers are semantic objects--(sets of) individuals, objects, states, actions, or events--represented in complex ways so that a strict coreference need not hold between related A center mentioned in the current utterance may be mentioned again in the next utterance (by the same or a different speaker). In this sense, a center is &amp;quot;forward-looking&amp;quot; (Cf). Crucially, one of the centers may be identified as &amp;quot;backward-looking&amp;quot; (Cb). Cb the entity an utterance centrally Its main role is to connect the current utterance to the preceding The term Center is used for the Cb. Thus an utterance may be associated with any number of Cfs, one of which may be the Cb. These Cfs are given a default Cb order, that &amp;quot;how much each center is expected to be the next Cb&amp;quot;. I regard Cb to be optional for It comes into exsistence by way of a that is, the process in which a previous non-Cb becomes the new Cb in discourse. (1981, 1983) focus foci local focusing correspond to Cb and Cfs, respectively. The difference is that Sidner uses two immediate foci (Discourse Focus and Actor Focus) while centering uses only one (Cb) (see Grosz et. al. 1983 for discussion). Various factors --syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic-are combined for the identification of the Cb. One of them the of pronominal expressions, expressed in the</abstract>

The basic Centering rule in Japanese can be obtained by changing the word pronoun to zero pronominal in (1) (Kameyama 1985).
