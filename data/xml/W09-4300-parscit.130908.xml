The proliferation of the Internet has revolutionised the way information is disseminated and presented.
Blogs no longer just relay and comment on news stories but also influence what is talked about in the
news. Such changes have not gone unnoticed by the computational linguistics research community,
which is increasingly processing or exploiting blogs in an attempt to keep track of what is going on
and mine information. This workshop focuses on how events can be identified and how information
related to event processing (e.g. NP coreference, temporal processing) can be extracted from blogs and
other online sources. Emphasis is on how existing methods for event processing need to be adapted in
order to process this medium, and on linguistic differences in the reporting of events in blogs and more
traditional news texts.
Event detection and processing is not a new topic in computational linguistics, but until now it has
focused mainly on processing of newswire. The TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et. al. 2003), the
AQUAINT TimeML corpus, and the NP4E corpus (Hasler, Orasan and Naumann 2006) exclusively
contain newswire, which may make them inappropriate for the development of methods which need to
process other text types. Moreover, the informal style and structure of most blog entries makes event
detection in these documents a difficult task. This workshop gives researchers the opportunity to present
efforts to develop resources related to event identification and processing using blog entries, including
annotation guidelines and linguistic analyses of such resources.
We would like to thank the organisers of the 7th International Conference on Recent Advances in
Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2009, for hosting this workshop as one of their satellite events.
We would also like to thank the researchers who submitted papers and the members of Programme
Committee for their help in the reviewing process.
We hope you enjoy the workshop,
The organising committee
