<bodyText confidence="0.999265170212767">
Previous approaches to designing language understanding systems have
considered language generation to bc the activity of a highly specialized
linguistic facility that is largely independent of other cognitive capabilities.
All the requisite knowledge for generation is embodied in a &amp;quot;generation
module&amp;quot; which, with appropriate modifications to the lexicon, is
transportable bctwccn different domains and applications. Application
programs construct &amp;quot;messages&amp;quot; in some internal representation, such as first
order predicate calculus or semantic networks, and hand them to the
generation module to be translated into natural language. The application
program decides what to say; the generation module decides how to say it.
In contrast with this previous work, this paper proposes an approach to
designing a language generation system that builds on the view of language
as action which has evolved from speech act theory (see Austin 121 and
Searle [Ill). According to this view, linguistic actions arc actions planned
to satisfy particular goals of the speaker, similar to other actions like
moving and looking. Language production is integrated with a speaker&apos;s
problem solving processes. l&apos;his approach is founded on the hypothesis
that planning and performing linguistic actions is an activity that is not
substantially different from planning and performing other kinds of
physical actions. Thc process of proSucing an utterance involves planning
actions to satisfy a number of different kinds of goals, and then efficiently
coordinating the actions that satisfy these goals. In the resulting
framework, there is no distinction between deciding what to say and
deciding how to say it.
This research has proceeded through a simultaneous, integrated effort in
two areas. l&apos;he first area of research is the theoretical problem of
identifying the goals and actions that occur in human communication and
then characterizing them in planning terms. The second is the more
applied task of developing machine-based planning methods that are
adequate to form plans based on the characterization developed as part of
the work in the first area. The eventual goal is to merge the results of the
two areas of effort into a planning system that is capable of producing
English sentences.
Rather than relying on a specialized generation module, language
generation is performed by a general problem-solving system that has a
great deal of knowledge about language. A planning system, named KAMP
(Knowledge and Modalities Planner), is currently under development that
can take a high-level goal-and plan to achieve it through both linguistic
and non-linguistic actions. Means for satisfying multple goals can be
integrated into a single utterance.
This paper examines the goals that arise in a dialog, and what actions
satisfy those goals. It then discusses an example of a sentence which
satisfies several goals simultaneously, and how KAMP will be able to
produce this and similar utterances. This system represents an extension to
Cohen&apos;s work on planning speech acts [3]. However, unlike Cohen&apos;s
system which plans actions on the level of informing and requesting, but
does not actually generate natural language sentences, KAMP applies general
problem-solving techniques to the entire language generation process,
including the construction of the utterance.
II. GoaLs and Actions used in Task Oriented Dialogues
The participants in a dialogue have four different major types of goals
which may be satisfied, either directly or indirectly, through utterances.
Physical goals, involve the physical state of the world. &apos;Fhe physical state
can only be altered by actions that have physical effects, and so speech acts
do not serve directly to achieve these goals. But since physical goals give
rise to other types of goals as subgoals, which may in turn be satisfied by
speech acts, they arc important to a language planning system. Goals that
bear directly on the utterances themselves are knowledge stale goals,
discourse goals, and social goals.
Any goal of a speaker can fit into one of these four categories. However,
each category has many sub-categories, with the goals in each sub-category
being satisfied by actions related to but different from those satisfying the
goals of other sub-categories. Delineating the primary categorizations of
goals and actions is one objective of this research.
Knowledge state goals involve changes in the beliefs and wants held by the
speaker or the hearer. They may be satisfied by several different kinds of
actions. Physical actions affect knowledge, since as a minimum the agent
knows he has performed the action. There are also actions that affect only
knowledge and do not change the state of the world — for example,
reading, looking and speech acts. Speech acts are a special case of
knowledge-producing actions because they do not produce knowledge
directly, like looking at a clock. Instead, the effects of speech acts manifest
themselves through the recognition of intention. The effect of a speech act.
according to Searle, is that the hearer recognizes the speaker&apos;s intention to
perform the act. The hearer then knows which speech act has been
performed, and because of rules governing the communication processes,
such as the Griccan maxims [4[, the hearer makes inferences about the
speaker&apos;s beliefs. These inferences all affect the hearer&apos;s own beliefs.
Discourse goals are goals that involve maintaining or changing the state of
the discourse. For example, a goal of focusing on a different concept is a
type of discourse goal [5, 9, 12]. &apos;the utterance Take John. for instance
serves to move the participants&apos; focusing from a general subject to a
specific example. Utterances of this nature seem to be explainable only in
terms of the effects they have, and not in terms of a formal specification of
their propositional content.
Concept activation goals are a particular category of discourse goals. These
are goals of bringing a concept of some object, state, or event into the
hearer&apos;s immediate conciousness so that he understands its role in the
utterance. Concept activation is a general goal that subsumes different
kinds of speaker reference. It is a low-level goal that is not considered
until the later stages of the planning process, but it is interesting because of
the large number of interactions between it and higher-level goals and the
large number of options available by which concept activations can be
performed.

<bodyText confidence="0.995211915789474">
Social goals also play an important pan in the planning of utterances.
These goals arc fundamentally different from other goals in that frequently
they arc not effects to be achieved so much as constraints on the possible
behavior that is acceptable in a given situation. Social goals relate to
politeness, and arc reflected in the surface form and content of the
utterance. However, there is no simple &amp;quot;formula&amp;quot; that one can follow to
construct polite utterances. Do you know what time ii is? may be a polite
way to ask the time, but Do you know your phone number? is not very
polite in most situations, but Could you tell me your phone number? is.
What is important in this example is the exact propositional content of the
utterance. People are expected to know phone numbers, but not
necessarily what time it is. Using an indirect speech act is not a sufficient
condition for politeness. This example illustrates how a social goal can
influence what is said, as well as how it is expressed.
Quite often the knowledge state goals have been assigned a special
priviliged status among all these goals. Conveying a propsition was viewed
as the primary reason for planning an utterance, and the task of a language
generator was to somehow construct an utterance that would be appropriate
in the current context. In contrast, this research attempts to take Halliday&apos;s
claim [7] seriously in the design of a computer system:
&amp;quot;We do not, in fact, first decide what we want to say
independently of the setting and then dress it up in a garb that
is appropriate to it in the context.... The &apos;content&apos; is part of
the total planning that takes place. There is no clear line
between the &apos;what&apos; and the &apos;how&apos;. . .&amp;quot;
The complexity that arises from the interactions of these different types of
goals leads to situations where the content of an utterance is dictated by
the requirement that it fit into the current context For example, a speaker
may plan to inform a hearer of a particular fact. The context of the
discourse may make it impossible for the speaker to make an abrupt
transition from the current topic to the topic that includes that proposition.
To make this transition according to the communicative rules may require
planning another utterance, Planning this utterance will in turn generate
other goals of informing, concept activation and focusing. The actions used
to satisfy these goals may affect the planning of the utterance that gave rise
to the subgoal. In this situation, there is no clear dividing line between
&amp;quot;what to say&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how to say it&amp;quot;.
III. An Integrated Approach to Planning Speech Acts
A probcm—solving system that plans utterances must have the ability to
describe actions at different levels of abstraction, the ability to specify a
partial ordering among sequences of actions, and the ability to consider a
plan globally to discover interactions and constraints among the actions
already planned. It must have an intelligent method for maintaining
alternatives, and evaluating them comparatively. Since reasoning about
belief is very important in planning utterances, the planning system must
have a knowledge representation that is adequate for representing facts
about belief, and a deduction system that is capable of using that
representation efficiently.
KAMI&apos; is a planning system, which is currently being implemented, that
builds on the NOAH planning system of Saccrdoti [14 It uses a
possible—worlds semantics approach to reasoning about belief and the
effects that various actions have on belief 181 and represents actions in a
data structure called a procedural network. 113e procedural network consists
of nodes representing actions at some level of abstraction, along with split
nodes, which specify several partially ordered sequences of actions that can
be performed in any order, or perhaps even in parallel, and choice nodes
which specify alternate actions, any one of which would achieve the goal.
Figure 1 is an example of a simple procedural network that represents the
following plan: The top—level goal is to achieve P. The downward link
from that node in the net points to an expansion of actions and subgoals,
which when performed or achieved, will make P true in the resulting
world. The plan consists of a choice between two alternatives. In the fitSC
the agent A docs actions Al and AZ and no commitment has been made to
the ordering of these two parts of the plan. After both of those pans have
been completely planned and executed, then action A3 is performed in the
resulting world. The other alternative is for agent B to perform action Aa.
It is an important feature of KAMP that it can represent actions at several
levels of abstraction. An itaroam action can be considered as a high level
action, which is expanded at a lower level of abstraction into concept
activation and focusing actions. After each expansion to a lower level of
abstraction, KAMP invokes a set of procedures called critics that examine
the plan globally, considering the interactions between its parts, resolving
conflicts, making the best choice among available alternatives, and noticing
redundant actions or actions that could be subsumed by minor alterations
in another part of the plan. The control structure could be described as a
loop that makes a plan, expands it, criticizes the result, and expands it
again, until the entire plan consists of executable actions.
The following is an example of the type of problem that KAMP has been
tested on: A robot named Rob and a man named John arc in a room that
is adjacent to a hallway containing a clock. Both Rob and John are
capable of moving, reading clocks, and talking to each other, and they each
know that the other is capable of performing these actions. They both
know that they are in the room, and they both know where the hallway is.
Neither Rob nor John knows what time it is. Suppose that Rob knows that
the clock is in the hall, but John does not. Suppose further that John
wants to know what time it is. and Rob knows he does. Furthermore, Rob
is helpful, and wants to do what he can to insure that John achieves his
goal. Rob&apos;s planning system must come up with a plan, perhaps involving
actions by both Rob and John, that will result in John knowing what time
it is.
Rob can devise a plan using KAMP that consists of a choice between two
alternatives. First, if John could find out where the clock is, he could go
to the clock and read it, and in the resulting state would know the time.
S. Rob can tell John where the clock is, -asoning that this information is
sufficient for John to form and execute a plan that would achieve his goal.

A Plan to Remove a Bolt
Thc second alternative is for Rob to move into the hall and read the clock Assume that the apprentice knows that the part is to be removed. and
himself, move back into the room, and tell John the time, wants to do the removal, but does not know of a procedure for doing it.
This situation would hold if the goal marked with an asterisk in figure 2
were unsatisfied. The expert must plan an action to inform the apprentice
of what the desired action is. This goal expands into an trIFORm action.
The expert also believes that the apprentice does not know where the
wrench is, and plans another INFORM action to tell him where it is located.
&apos;Mc planner tests the ACIIIEVE goals to ace if it believes that any of them
are already true in the current state of the world, In the case we are
considering, RAMP&apos;S model of the hearer should indicate that he knows
what the bolt is. and what the wrench is, but doesn&apos;t know what the action
is. i.e. that he should use that particular wrench to loosen that bolt, and he
doesn&apos;t know the location of the wrench. If informing actions are planned
to satisfy those goals that are not already satisfied, then that part of the
plan looks like Figure 3.
Each of the INFORM actions is a high—level action that can be expanded.
The planner has a set of standard expansions for actions of this type. In
NOAH, these actions were written in SOUP code. In this planner, they are
represented in situation-action rules. The conditional of the rule involves
tests on the type of action to be performed, the hearer&apos;s knowledge, and
social goals. The action is to select a particular strategy for expanding the
action. In this case, a rule such as If you are expanding an inform of what
an action involving the hearer as agent is, then use an IMPERATIVE syntactic
construct to describe the action. The planner then inserts the expansion
shown in Figure 4 into the plan.

As of the time of this writing, KAMP has been implemented and tested on
problems involving the planning of high level speech act descriptions, and
performs tasks comparable to the planner implemented by Cohen. A more
complete description of this planner, and the motivation for its design can
be found in [11. The following example is intended to give the reader a
feeling for how the planner will proceed in a typical situation involving
linguistic planning, but is not a description of a currently working system.
An expert and an apprentice are cooperating in the task of repairing an air
compressor. The expert is assumed to be a computer system that has
complete knowledge of all aspects of the task, but has no means of
manipulating the world except by requesting the apprentice to do things,
and furnishing him or her with the knowledge needed to complete the task.
Figure 2 shows a partially completed procedural network. The node at the
highest level indicates the planner&apos;s top—level goal, which in this case is
removing a particular object (nRACE1) from an air compressor. It knows
that this goal can be achieved by the apprentice executing a particular
unfastening operation involving a specific wrench and a specific bolt. The
expert knows that the apprentice can do the action if he knows what the
objects involved in the task are, and knows what the action is (i.e. that he
knows how to do the action). This is reflected in the second goal in the
split path in the procedural network. Since the plan also requires obtaining
a wrench and using it, a goal is also established that the apprentice knows
where the wrench is: hence the goal AciiiEvE(Know(Apprentice. On(Table,
Wri))).

This sub-plan is marked by a tag indicating that it is to be realized by an
imperative. The split specifies which lower level actions are performed by
the utterance of the imperative. At some point, a critic will choose an
ordering for the actions. Without further information the sentence could
be realized in any of the following ways, some of which sound strange
when spoken in 15101m/oh:
Loosen Bold with Wrl.
With Wrl loosen Bola.
Bolti loosen with Wrl.
The first sentence above sounds natural in isolation. The other two might
be chosen if a critic notices a need to realize a focusing action that has
been planned. For example, the second sentence shifts the focus to the
wrench instead of the bolt, and would be useful in organizing a series of
instructions around what tools to use. The third would be used in a
discourse organized around what object to manipulate next.
Up to this point, the planning process has been quite straightforward, since
none of the critics have come into play. However, since there arc two
INFORM actions on two branches of the same split, the COMRIN12-CONCEPT-
ACnvATION critic is invoked. This critic is invoked whenever a plan
contains a concept activation on one branch of the split, and an inform of
some property of the activated object on the other branch. Sometimes the
planner can combine the two informing actions into one by including the
property description of one of the informing acts into the description that
is being used for the concept activation.
In this particular example, Use critic would attach to the Do(Expert,
cAcnAppr„ Wr1)) action the constraint that one of the realizing descriptors
must be oN(Wrl. Table), and the goal that the apprentice knows the
wrench is on the table is marked as already satisfied.
Another critic, the REDUNDANT-PATH critic, notices when portions of two
brances of a split contain identical actions, and collapses the two branches
into one. This critic, when applied to utterance plans will often result in a
sentence with an and conjunction. The critic is not restricted to apply only
to linguistic actions, and may apply to other types of actions as well.
Other critics know about action subsumption, and what kinds of focusing
actions can be realized in terms of which linguistic choices. One of these
action subsumption critics can make a decision about the ordering of the
concept activations, and can mark discourse goals as pha,. -nns. In t1 is
example, there are no specific discourse goals, so it is possible to chose the
default verb-object-instrument ordering.
On the next next expansion cycle, the concept activations must be
expanded into utterances. This means planning descriptors for the objects.
Planning the right description requires reasoning about what the hearer
believes about thc object, describing it as economically as possible, and
then adding the additional descriptors recommended by the action
subsumption critic. The final step is realizing the descriptors in natural
language. Some descriptors have straightforward realizations as lexical
items. Others may require planning a prepositional phrase or a relative
clause.
IV. Formally defining linguistic actions
If actions arc to be planned by a planning system, they must be defined
formally so they can be used by the system. This means explicitly stating
the preconditions and effects of each action. Physical actions have received
attention in the literature on planning, but one aspect of physical actions
that has been ignored arc their effects on knowledge. Moore [8] suggests
an approach to formalizing, the knowledge effects of physical actions, so I
will not pursue that further at this time.
A fairly large amount of work has been done on the formal specification of
speech acts on the level of informing and requesting, etc. Most of this
work has been done by Searle [111, and has been incorporated into a
planning system by Cohen [3].
Not much has been done to fonnally specify the actions of focusing and
concept activation. Sidncr [12] has developed a set of formal rules for
detecting focus movement in a discourse, and has suggested that these rules
could be translated into an appropriate set of actions that a generation
system could use. Since there arc a number of well defined strategics that
speakers use to focus on different topics. I suggest that the preconditions
and effects of these strategies could be defined precisely and they can be
incorporated as operators in a planning system. Reichmann [9] describes a
number of focusing strategies and the situations in which they are
applicable. The focusing mechanism is driven by the speaker&apos;s goal that
the hearer know what is currently being focused on. This particular type
of knowledge state goal is satisfied by a variety of different actions. These
actions have preconditions which depend on what the current state of the
discourse is, and what type of shift is taking place.
Consider the problem of moving the focus back to the previous topic of
discussion after a brief digression onto a different but related topic.
Reichmann points out that several actions arc available. One such action is
the utterance of &amp;quot;anyway&amp;quot; which signals a more or less expected focus
shift. She claims that the utterance of &amp;quot;but&amp;quot; can achieve 4 similar effect,
but is used where the speaker believes that the hearer believes that a
discussion on the current topic will continue, and that presupposition needs
to be countered. Each of these two actions will be defined in the planning
system as operators. The &amp;quot;but&amp;quot; operator will have as an additional
precondition that the hearer believes that the speaker&apos;s next utterance will
be part of the current context. Roth operators will have the effect that the
hearer believes that the. speaker is focusing on the previous topic of
discussion.
Other operators that arc available include explicity labeled shifts. This
operator exp. pis into planning an INFORM of a focus shift. The previous
example of Take John. for instance is an example of such an action.
The precise logical axiomitization of focusing and the precise definitions of
each of these actions is a topic of curre-t research. The point being made
here is that these focusing actions can be specified formally. One goal of
this research is to formally describe linguistic actions and other knowledge
producing actions adequately enough to demonstrate the feasibility of a
language planning system.

Means for satisfying multple goals can be integrated into a single utterance. This paper examines the goals that arise in a dialog, and what actions satisfy those goals. It then discusses an example of a sentence which satisfies several goals simultaneously, and how KAMP will be able to produce this and similar utterances. This system represents an extension to Cohen&apos;s work on planning speech acts [3]. However, unlike Cohen&apos;s system which plans actions on the level of informing and requesting, but does not actually generate natural language sentences, KAMP applies general problem-solving techniques to the entire language generation process, including the construction of the utterance. II. GoaLs and Actions used in Task Oriented Dialogues The participants in a dialogue have four different major types of goals which may be satisfied, either directly or indirectly, through utterances. Physical goals, involve the physical state of the world. &apos;Fhe physical state can only be altered by actions t</context>

Physical actions have received attention in the literature on planning, but one aspect of physical actions that has been ignored arc their effects on knowledge. Moore [8] suggests an approach to formalizing, the knowledge effects of physical actions, so I will not pursue that further at this time. A fairly large amount of work has been done on the formal specification of speech acts on the level of informing and requesting, etc. Most of this work has been done by Searle [111, and has been incorporated into a planning system by Cohen [3]. Not much has been done to fonnally specify the actions of focusing and concept activation. Sidncr [12] has developed a set of formal rules for detecting focus movement in a discourse, and has suggested that these rules could be translated into an appropriate set of actions that a generation system could use. Since there arc a number of well defined strategics that speakers use to focus on different topics. I suggest that the preconditions and effects of these strategies could be defined precisely and they can be incorporated as operators in a planning system. Reichmann [9] describes a number</context>

The effect of a speech act. according to Searle, is that the hearer recognizes the speaker&apos;s intention to perform the act. The hearer then knows which speech act has been performed, and because of rules governing the communication processes, such as the Griccan maxims [4[, the hearer makes inferences about the speaker&apos;s beliefs. These inferences all affect the hearer&apos;s own beliefs. Discourse goals are goals that involve maintaining or changing the state of the discourse. For example, a goal of focusing on a different concept is a type of discourse goal [5, 9, 12]. &apos;the utterance Take John. for instance serves to move the participants&apos; focusing from a general subject to a specific example. Utterances of this nature seem to be explainable only in terms of the effects they have, and not in terms of a formal specification of their propositional content. Concept activation goals are a particular category of discourse goals. These are goals of bringing a concept of some object, state, or event into the hearer&apos;s immediate conciousness so that he understands its role in the utterance.

Using an indirect speech act is not a sufficient condition for politeness. This example illustrates how a social goal can influence what is said, as well as how it is expressed. Quite often the knowledge state goals have been assigned a special priviliged status among all these goals. Conveying a propsition was viewed as the primary reason for planning an utterance, and the task of a language generator was to somehow construct an utterance that would be appropriate in the current context. In contrast, this research attempts to take Halliday&apos;s claim [7] seriously in the design of a computer system: &amp;quot;We do not, in fact, first decide what we want to say independently of the setting and then dress it up in a garb that is appropriate to it in the context.... The &apos;content&apos; is part of the total planning that takes place. There is no clear line between the &apos;what&apos; and the &apos;how&apos;. . .&amp;quot; The complexity that arises from the interactions of these different types of goals leads to situations where the content of an utterance is dictated by the requirement that it fit into the current context For example, a speaker may plan to inform a hearer of a particula</context>

Some descriptors have straightforward realizations as lexical items. Others may require planning a prepositional phrase or a relative clause. IV. Formally defining linguistic actions If actions arc to be planned by a planning system, they must be defined formally so they can be used by the system. This means explicitly stating the preconditions and effects of each action. Physical actions have received attention in the literature on planning, but one aspect of physical actions that has been ignored arc their effects on knowledge. Moore [8] suggests an approach to formalizing, the knowledge effects of physical actions, so I will not pursue that further at this time.

Reichmann [9] describes a number of focusing strategies and the situations in which they are applicable. The focusing mechanism is driven by the speaker&apos;s goal that the hearer know what is currently being focused on. This particular type of knowledge state goal is satisfied by a variety of different actions. These actions have preconditions which depend on what the current state of the discourse is, and what type of shift is taking place. Consider the problem of moving the focus back to the previous topic of discussion after a brief digression onto a different but related topic. Reichmann points out that s</context>
