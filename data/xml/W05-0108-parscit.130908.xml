This paper describes the cooperation of
four European Universities aiming at at-
tracting more students to European master
studies in Language and Communication
Technologies. The cooperation has been
formally approved within the framework
of the new European program “Erasmus
Mundus” as a Specific Support Action in
2004. The consortium also aims at creat-
ing a sound basis for a joint master pro-
gram in the field of language technology
and computer science.

1 European higher education: Erasmus
Mundus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970025">
The Erasmus Mundus programme [1] is a co-
operation and mobility program in the field of
higher education. It aims to enhance quality in
European higher education and to promote inter-
cultural understanding through co-operation with
non-EU countries.
The program is intended to strengthen European
co-operation and international links in higher edu-
cation by supporting high-quality European Mas-
ters Courses, by enabling students and visiting
scholars from around the world to engage in post-
graduate study at European universities, as well as

by encouraging the outgoing mobility of European
students and scholars towards non-EU countries.
The Erasmus Mundus program comprises four
concrete actions:
ACTION 1 - Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses:
high-quality integrated courses at masters level
offered by a consortium of at least three universi-
ties in at least three different European countries.
ACTION 2 - Erasmus Mundus scholarships: a
scholarship scheme for non-EU-country graduate
students and scholars from the whole world.
ACTION 3 - Partnerships: Erasmus Mundus Mas-
ters Courses selected under Action 1 also have the
possibility of establishing partnerships with non-
EU-country higher education institutions.
ACTION 4 - Enhancing attractiveness: projects
aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the Euro-
pean higher education.

3 Overall aims of the project
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999879">
The overall aim of the project is to export the
common educational experience currently embod-
ied within existing Masters programs of the con-
sortium to scholars and students of non-EU
countries.
This aim will be realized by several different
classes of activity under the rubrics of (i) work-
shops (ii) distance learning tools and (iii) coordina-
tion of a common Master program. We discuss
these in the following sections.

3.1 Workshops
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952652173913">
One of the most important types of activities of
the project is organizing workshops and courses
both for students from non-EU countries and for
their teachers. The effect of these events is at least
twofold – the students from countries or regions
which do not have an access to any higher degree
education in LCT get a chance to broaden their
perspective by listening to lectures of prominent
scientists and lecturers. The courses will also help
the consortium to establish better contacts with
non-EU Universities, teachers, and students which
will turn out to be invaluable when disseminating
the common European Master program in Lan-
guage Technology discussed further below.
Both ÚFAL and CoLi have a long tradition in
respect of offering such courses to students from
the broadest possible range of countries.
ÚFAL has devoted a huge effort in the past to
raise funding for the organization, once or twice a
year, of a series of lectures by prominent scientists
and lecturers from all over the world. This series of
lectures, the Vilem Mathesius courses [6], have
become well-known, especially among the Central

At CoLi, the Computational Linguistics Collo-
quium is also a traditional event attracting the at-
tention of both well-known lecturers and a number
of master and postgraduate students from various
countries. A second series of lectures in the frame
of our project was held at the University of Saar-
landes in Saarbruecken in January.
A third event, organized by the CBS, will take
place in June. The first day consists of information
seminar on content management and language
technology to promote CBS’ newly-launched In-
ternational Master of Language Administration,
whilst the second will be devoted to diffusion of a
various issues connected to the Erasmus Mundus
course.
Finally, a fourth event, in the form of a work-
shop with invited guest lecturers, is being organ-
ized at the University of Malta that will take place
in September 2005. The theme of the workshop
will be Machine Translation which is currently
very topical given the newly-achieved official
European status that the local language now enjoys.

3.2 Coordination of Masters Programs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975764171428572">
A second important aim of the LATER project
is the definition, coordination and implementation
of an integrated European Masters Programme in
LCT by creating a common basis that will appeal
to both European and non-EU students.
The rationale behind the creation of such a pro-
gramme is the assumption that LCT now occupies
a central position in research and education in
Europe, being a key enabling technology for nu-
merous applications related to the information so-
ciety, although the shortage of qualified
researchers and developers is slowing down the
speed of innovation in Europe.
The proposed programme addresses this short-
age by creating a directed education and training
opportunity for the next generation of LCT innova-
tors in that will in turn bring educational, social
and economic benefits. Some specific aims of

3.3 Distance learning tools
A third aim of LATER is the development of
effective methods of hosting and integrating non-
EU students, for example by developing distance
learning tools and joint distance education modules,
in order to facilitate outreach by online dissemina-
tion of courses. An example of such modules, as
well as for computer-based tools, is being devel-
oped on the basis of the virtual courses CoLi has
developed in the last 3 years in the framework of
the MiLCA project (Medienintensive Lehrmodule
in der Computerlinguistik-Ausbildung1).
We also plan to explore the use of collaboration
technologies based on Sitescape [16], that have
been developed at CBS for academic collaboration,
for the management of certain aspects of the pro-

<table confidence="0.925112523809524">
posed Masters programme.
The fruits of various initiatives already under
way at UoM will be exploited and extended during
the life of the proposed course. These include in-
teractive web based course delivery [13], just-in-
time support based on P2P architectures [14],
XML-based frameworks for online courses [15],
the latter being developed within as a part of the
Mediterranean Virtual University (MVU)
EUMEDIS project [17].
4 Integrated European LCT Masters
Programme
Whilst many agree with the above assessment of
the importance of LCT, they disagree on the defi-
nition of “integrated course”. Fortunately, we can
turn to the comprehensive definition supplied by
the EU call, the central element of which is “a
jointly developed curriculum or full recognition by
the consortium of modules which are developed
1 for more see http://milca.sfs.uni-
tuebingen.de/index.html.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99928584">
and delivered separately, but make up a common
standard Masters course.”
Again, some turn away in horror at the notion of
a standard curriculum in this area, the claim being
that there is already enough standardization in the
world, so why add to it? The point is, any pro-
gramme dealing with LCT has to address the fact
that it is highly interdisciplinary, including, at the
core, computer science, computational and theo-
retical linguistics, and mathematics, and at the pe-
riphery, a wide variety of other subjects including
electrical engineering, psychology, cognitive sci-
ence artificial intelligence etc.
With such a large number of disciplines in-
volved, it is practically impossible for a single
University to excel in all of them. However if more
than one University is involved, various kinds of
curriculum sharing can be envisaged and so a
much higher level of coverage becomes entirely
achievable.
Put another way, curriculum sharing, together
with common admission and assessment proce-
dures envisaged, allows delivery of a complex
course to be handled by what is effectively a “su-
peruniversity”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98801">
4.1 Integration in practice
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986924">
To put this idea into practice we are proposing
that students will get the chance to attend a two
years’ master program at two universities chosen
from a larger consortium, which is currently being
put together. It includes the four original partners
of the LATER project and the following new part-
ners: University of Amsterdam (UvA) in the Neth-
erlands, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen (FUB)
in Italy, the Universities of Nancy 1 and Nancy 2
in France, Roskilde University in Denmark and
Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
Studying in multi-national groups at two uni-
versities in Europe, with English as instruction
language, accompanied by language classes in an-
other European language, will contribute to the
students&apos; preparation for the increasing globaliza-
tion of science, commerce and industry. The
course also will also prepare students for follow-up
Ph.D. studies provided by the participating partners
and others.
The proposed programme follows the Bologna
model for higher education in Europe and com-
prises 120 ECTS2 credits, 30 of which make up the
Masters dissertation, and 90 of which are course-
work credits structured as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996187285714286">
• Compulsory modules in Computer Science (28
ECTS)
• Compulsory modules in Language Technology
(28 ECTS)
• Advanced modules in Language Technology,

ence (34 ECTS)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999011642857143">
Coursework is distributed over three semesters,
while the dissertation is supposed to be completed
in the fourth semester
It is important to underline that this structure
permits a considerable degree of variation. First, a
module might be “implemented” by different set of
courses at different Universities. Secondly, the ad-
vanced modules are electives, based on the specific
strengths in research and teaching of individual
partner institutions. There is no requirement that
the advanced modules offered by different Univer-
sities should coincide.
Let us now introduce individual modules in
more detail. Parentheses indicate ECTS credits.

4.2 Main issues to be addressed
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983038461538">
Although it was not explicitly mentioned in the
previous text, the integration of existing master
programmes is done exclusively pair-wise. The
students can’t study at three universities (although
the rules of the Erasmus Mundus programme allow
such triangular cooperation). The restrictions
within our consortia go even further – the students
do not have a free choice of a combination of any
two universities from within the consortium, they
must choose one of the pairs offered by the consor-
tium.
The reason for such a restriction is pretty simple
- it turned out that although all members of the
consortia in principle provide education both in
Computer Science and in Computational Linguis-
tics, they differ in the balance between these two
fields. Within the consortium, there are universities
with a strong stress on a Computer Science courses,
aiming at a complex education including the sound
theoretical background in the field, while other
universities offer a more practically oriented edu-
cational scheme, stressing the concepts attracting a
wider audience, e.g. various types of web tech-
nologies, databases, data mining etc.
As a result of this, each university participates in
an average of four bilateral partnerships. We think
that the fact that the consortium consists of univer-
sities which are not identical greatly increases the
variety of options available. They have a chance to
choose those universities which are best suited to
their preferences whether these are in terms of sub-
ject area emphasis or geographical region.
The preparation of the integrated Master pro-
gramme doesn’t stop at matching the universities
and lectures offered. Erasmus Mundus is not just a
cooperation, it is really a completely new scheme
which must also address practical issues as grades,
examination procedures, admission procedure, tui-
tion fees, defense of the thesis, local specialties
existing at some partner universities etc.
The proposed Masters programme is something
new. It is the first attempt to create a comprehen-
sive Masters degree in this subject area that con-
forms to all the legalistic requirements of each
participating University. Students completing the
course will possess a Masters degree delivered by
two of the participant Universities. This is in con-
trast to the existing European Master in Language
and Speech [11], which is implemented through a
certification procedure that does not replace any
legal degree that a student may obtain from a Uni-
versity.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999193">
Although the process of establishing a new Euro-
pean Master programme in Language Technology
was really very complicated, time consuming and
painful, there are definitely already at this stage
very positive results.
In order to submit a proposal, our consortium
has managed to overcome all formal and structural
differences among all partners, it has found a rea-
sonable model of cooperation, it has developed a
high-quality master programme open both to Euro-
pean and non-EU students.
The wide variety of modules and topics offered
combined with a relatively high degree of freedom
of choice for students allows for individual pairs of
partner universities to promote those courses and
fields in which they excel. The students are of
course offered individual guidance from consor-
tium members in order to allow them to identify
that pair of universities which best suits their indi-
vidual needs and preferences

The strategy we have chosen – the initial coop-

ject, promoting LTC education among the students
from outside the EU and testing our ability both to
offer a coordinated high-quality education and to
attract a reasonable amount of interested students,
has turned to be a sound one. It also helped to
solve some issues in the larger consortium based
on the experience from the smaller one.

The consortium also aims at creating a sound basis for a joint master program in the field of language technology and computer science. 1 European higher education: Erasmus Mundus The Erasmus Mundus programme [1] is a cooperation and mobility program in the field of higher education. It aims to enhance quality in European higher education and to promote intercultural understanding through co-operation with non-EU countries. The program is intended to strengthen European co-operation and international links in higher education by supporting high-quality European Masters Courses, by enabling students and visiting scholars from around the world to engage in postgraduate study at European universities, as well as 43 by encouraging the outgoing mobility of European students and scholars towards non-EU countries. The Erasmus Mundus program comprises four concrete actions: ACTION 1 - Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses: high-quality integrated courses at masters level offered by a consortium of at least three universities in at least three different European countries. ACTION 2 - Erasmus Mundus scholarships: a scholarship scheme for non-EU-country graduate students and scholars from the whole world. ACTION 3 - Partnerships: Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses selected under Action 1 also have the possibility of establishing partnerships with non- EU-country higher education institutions. ACTION 4 - Enhancing attractiveness: projects aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the European higher education. 2 LATER One of the projects approved for funding (and the only one in the field of language technology) in the call is called LATER – Mundus [2].

<abstract confidence="0.95749862295082">lished in 1993, teaches both Bachelors and Masters degree programs. The 4-year BSc. (tions) scheme include several streams relevant to Language Technology including NLP and Computational Linguistics itself, Information Retrieval, Semantic Web, Internet and Agent technologies. The Department also runs a, one-year research oriented M.Sc. program [10]. The areas of specialization include the development of computational tools, techniques and resources for Maltese, the only semitic language to enjoy official EU status. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) The Department of Computational Linguistics is part of the Faculty of Modern Languages at the Copenhagen Business School. The Department is actively involved in research in the following four core fields: formal descriptions of the Danish language, modeling of knowledge relevant for LSP, LSP databases, and Machine Translation. Embedded in this context is the Master of Language Administration (MLA) [9] that the Department of Computational Linguistics of the Copenhagen Business School offers in co-operation with the University of Southern Denmark in Roskilde 3 Overall aims of the project The overall aim of the project is to export the common educational experience currently embodied within existing Masters programs of the consortium to scholars and students of non-EU countries. This aim will be realized by several different classes of activity under the rubrics of (i) workshops (ii) distance learning tools and (iii) coordination of a common Master program. We discuss these in the following sections. 3.1 Workshops One of the most important types of activities of the project is organizing workshops and courses both for students from non-EU countries and for their teachers. The effect of these events is at least twofold – the students from countries or regions which do not have an access to any higher degree education in LCT get a chance to broaden their perspective by listening to lectures of prominent scientists and lecturers. The courses will also help the consortium to establish better contacts with non-EU Universities, teachers, and students which will turn out to be invaluable when disseminating the common European Master program in Language Technology discussed further below. Both ÚFAL and CoLi have a long tradition in respect of offering such courses to students from the broadest possible range of countries. ÚFAL has devoted a huge effort in the past to raise funding for the organization, once or twice a year, of a series of lectures by prominent scientists and lecturers from all over the world. This series of lectures, the Vilem Mathesius courses [6], have become well-known, especially among the Central 44 and East European students of computational and general linguistics. Erasmus Mundus are also addressed: European education in LCT will be promoted worldwide and its competitiveness increased, increasing at the same time the competitiveness of European IT in-dustries, creating a multilingual information soci-ety that is accessible for all, and turning the ̏information overload&amp;quot; into a wealth of accessible and useful knowledge.</abstract>
<note confidence="0.503511285714286">This year’s course, held in March under the aus-pices of LATER, was able to support the atten-dance of 50 students from Russia, Ukraine, Albania, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia and Georgia to lectures by prominent individuals including two ACL award winners. At CoLi, the Computational Linguistics Collo-quium is also a traditional event attracting the at-tention of both well-known lecturers and a number of master and postgraduate students from various countries. A second series of lectures in the frame of our project was held at the University of Saar-landes in Saarbruecken in January. A third event, organized by the CBS, will take place in June. The first day consists of information seminar on content management and language technology to promote CBS’ newly-launched In-ternational Master of Language Administration, whilst the second will be devoted to diffusion of a various issues connected to the Erasmus Mundus course. Finally, a fourth event, in the form of a work-shop with invited guest lecturers, is being organ-ized at the University of Malta that will take place in September 2005. The theme of the workshop will be Machine Translation which is currently very topical given the newly-achieved official European status that the local language now enjoys. of Masters Programs A second important aim of the LATER project is the definition, coordination and implementation of an integrated European Masters Programme in LCT by creating a common basis that will appeal to both European and non-EU students. The rationale behind the creation of such a pro-gramme is the assumption that LCT now occupies a central position in research and education in Europe, being a key enabling technology for nu-merous applications related to the information so-ciety, although the shortage of qualified researchers and developers is slowing down the speed of innovation in Europe. The proposed programme addresses this short-age by creating a directed education and training opportunity for the next generation of LCT innova-tors in that will in turn bring educational, social and economic benefits. Some specific aims of 45 3.3 Distance learning tools A third aim of LATER is the development of effective methods of hosting and integrating non-EU students, for example by developing distance learning tools and joint distance education modules, in order to facilitate outreach by online dissemina-tion of courses. An example of such modules, as well as for computer-based tools, is being devel-oped on the basis of the virtual courses CoLi has developed in the last 3 years in the framework of the MiLCA project (Medienintensive Lehrmodule der We also plan to explore the use of collaboration technologies based on Sitescape [16], that have been developed at CBS for academic collaboration, for the management of certain aspects of the pro-posed Masters programme. The fruits of various initiatives already under way at UoM will be exploited and extended during the life of the proposed course. These include in-teractive web based course delivery [13], just-in-time support based on P2P architectures [14], XML-based frameworks for online courses [15], the latter being developed within as a part of the Mediterranean Virtual University (MVU) EUMEDIS project [17]. 4 Integrated European LCT Masters Programme</note>
<abstract confidence="0.966084703703704">Whilst many agree with the above assessment of the importance of LCT, they disagree on the defi-nition of “integrated course”. Fortunately, we can turn to the comprehensive definition supplied by the EU call, the central element of which is “a jointly developed curriculum or full recognition by the consortium of modules which are developed 1for more see http://milca.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/index.html. and delivered separately, but make up a common standard Masters course.” Again, some turn away in horror at the notion of a standard curriculum in this area, the claim being that there is already enough standardization in the so why add to it? The point is, programme dealing with LCT has to address the fact that it is highly interdisciplinary, including, at the core, computer science, computational and theoretical linguistics, and mathematics, and at the periphery, a wide variety of other subjects including electrical engineering, psychology, cognitive science artificial intelligence etc. With such a large number of disciplines involved, it is practically impossible for a single to excel in if more than one University is involved, various kinds of curriculum sharing can be envisaged and so a much higher level of coverage becomes entirely achievable. Put another way, curriculum sharing, together with common admission and assessment procedures envisaged, allows delivery of a complex course to be handled by what is effectively a “superuniversity”. in practice To put this idea into practice we are proposing that students will get the chance to attend a two years’ master program at two universities chosen from a larger consortium, which is currently being put together. It includes the four original partners of the LATER project and the following new partners: University of Amsterdam (UvA) in the Netherlands, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen (FUB) in Italy, the Universities of Nancy 1 and Nancy 2 in France, Roskilde University in Denmark and Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Studying in multi-national groups at two universities in Europe, with English as instruction language, accompanied by language classes in another European language, will contribute to the students&apos; preparation for the increasing globalization of science, commerce and industry. The course also will also prepare students for follow-up Ph.D. studies provided by the participating partners and others. The proposed programme follows the Bologna model for higher education in Europe and com- 120 credits, 30 of which make up the Masters dissertation, and 90 of which are coursework credits structured as follows: • Compulsory modules in Computer Science (28</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.960829733333333">ence (34 ECTS) Coursework is distributed over three semesters, while the dissertation is supposed to be completed in the fourth semester It is important to underline that this structure permits a considerable degree of variation. First, a module might be “implemented” by different set of courses at different Universities. Secondly, the advanced modules are electives, based on the specific strengths in research and teaching of individual partner institutions. There is no requirement that the advanced modules offered by different Universities should coincide. Let us now introduce individual modules in more detail.

<abstract confidence="0.975895747967479">Answering, Psycholinguistics etc.. issues to be addressed Although it was not explicitly mentioned in the previous text, the integration of existing master programmes is done exclusively pair-wise. The students can’t study at three universities (although the rules of the Erasmus Mundus programme allow such triangular cooperation). The restrictions within our consortia go even further – the students do not have a free choice of a combination of any two universities from within the consortium, they must choose one of the pairs offered by the consortium. The reason for such a restriction is pretty simple it turned out that although all members of the consortia in principle provide education both in Computer Science and in Computational Linguistics, they differ in the balance between these two fields. Within the consortium, there are universities with a strong stress on a Computer Science courses, aiming at a complex education including the sound theoretical background in the field, while other universities offer a more practically oriented educational scheme, stressing the concepts attracting a wider audience, e.g. various types of web technologies, databases, data mining etc. As a result of this, each university participates in an average of four bilateral partnerships. We think that the fact that the consortium consists of universities which are not identical greatly increases the variety of options available. They have a chance to choose those universities which are best suited to their preferences whether these are in terms of subject area emphasis or geographical region. The preparation of the integrated Master programme doesn’t stop at matching the universities and lectures offered. Erasmus Mundus is not just a cooperation, it is really a completely new scheme which must also address practical issues as grades, examination procedures, admission procedure, tuition fees, defense of the thesis, local specialties existing at some partner universities etc. The proposed Masters programme is something new. It is the first attempt to create a comprehensive Masters degree in this subject area that conforms to all the legalistic requirements of each participating University. Students completing the course will possess a Masters degree delivered by two of the participant Universities. This is in contrast to the existing European Master in Language and Speech [11], which is implemented through a certification procedure that does not replace any legal degree that a student may obtain from a University. 5 Conclusion Although the process of establishing a new European Master programme in Language Technology was really very complicated, time consuming and painful, there are definitely already at this stage very positive results. In order to submit a proposal, our consortium has managed to overcome all formal and structural differences among all partners, it has found a reasonable model of cooperation, it has developed a high-quality master programme open both to European and non-EU students. The wide variety of modules and topics offered combined with a relatively high degree of freedom of choice for students allows for individual pairs of partner universities to promote those courses and fields in which they excel. The students are of course offered individual guidance from consortium members in order to allow them to identify that pair of universities which best suits their individual needs and preferences 47 The strategy we have chosen – the initial cooperation of a smaller consortium in the LATER project, promoting LTC education among the students from outside the EU and testing our ability both to offer a coordinated high-quality education and to attract a reasonable amount of interested students, has turned to be a sound one. It also helped to solve some issues in the larger consortium based on the experience from the smaller one.

The cooperation has been formally approved within the framework of the new European program “Erasmus Mundus” as a Specific Support Action in 2004. The consortium also aims at creating a sound basis for a joint master program in the field of language technology and computer science. 1 European higher education: Erasmus Mundus The Erasmus Mundus programme [1] is a cooperation and mobility program in the field of higher education. It aims to enhance quality in European higher education and to promote intercultural understanding through co-operation with non-EU countries. The program is intended to strengthen European co-operation and international links in higher education by supporting high-quality European Masters Courses, by enabling students and visiting scholars from around the world to engage in postgraduate study at European universities, as well as 43 by encouraging the outgoing mobility of European students and scholars towards non-EU coun</context>
