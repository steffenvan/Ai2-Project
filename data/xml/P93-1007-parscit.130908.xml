Interpreting fully natural speech is an important goal
for spoken language understanding systems. However,
while corpus studies have shown that about 10% of
spontaneous utterances contain self-corrections, or RE-
PAIRS, little is known about the extent to which cues in
the speech signal may facilitate repair processing. We
identify several cues based on acoustic and prosodic
analysis of repairs in a corpus of spontaneous speech,
and propose methods for exploiting these cues to detect
and correct repairs. We test our acoustic-prosodic cues
with other lexical cues to repair identification and find
that precision rates of 89-93% and recall of 78-83%
can be achieved, depending upon the cues employed,
from a prosodically labeled corpus.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998906125">
Disfluencies in spontaneous speech pose serious prob-
lems for spoken language systems. First, a speaker
may produce a partial word or FRAGMENT, a string of
phonemes that does not form the complete intended
word. Some fragments may coincidentally match
words actually in the lexicon, such as fly in Exam-
ple (1); others will be identified with the acoustically
closest item(s) in the lexicon, as in Example (2).1

<bodyText confidence="0.9818546">
Even if all words in a disfiuent segment are correctly
recognized, failure to detect a disfluency may lead to
interpretation errors during subsequent processing, as
in Example (3).
&apos;The presence of a word fragment in examples is indicated
by the diacritic `—&apos;. Self-corrected portions of the utterance
appear in boldface. All examples in this paper are drawn
from the ATIS corpus described below. Recognition output
shown in Example (2) is from the system described in (Lee

Here, &apos;twenty two twenty one forty&apos; must be interpreted
as a flight arrival time; the system must somehow
choose among &apos;21:40&apos;, &apos;22:21&apos;, and &apos;22:40&apos;.
Although studies of large speech corpora have
found that approximately 10% of spontaneous utter-
ances contain disfluencies involving self-correction, or
REPAIRS (Hindle, 1983; Shriberg et al., 1992), little is
known about how to integrate repair processing with
real-time speech recognition. In particular, the speech
signal itself has been relatively unexplored as a source
of processing cues for the detection and correction of
repairs. In this paper, we present results from a study of
the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of 334 repair
utterances, containing 368 repair instances, from the
A RPA Air Travel Information System (Ails) database.
Our results are interpreted within our &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot;
framework for investigating repairs, the REPAIR IN-
TERVAL MODEL (RIM). RIM builds upon Labov (1966)
and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT
SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS — that repairs are acoustically or
phonetically marked at the point of interruption of flu-
ent speech. After describing acoustic and prosodic
characteristics of the repair instances in our corpus, we
use these and other lexical cues to test the utility of
our &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; approach to repair identification on
a prosodically labeled corpus.

Previous Computational Approaches

<bodyText confidence="0.994235583333333">
While self-correction has long been a topic of psy-
cholinguistic study, computational work in this area
has been sparse. Early work in computational linguis-
tics treated repairs as one type of ill-formed input and
proposed solutions based upon extensions to existing
text parsing techniques such as augmented transition
networks (ATNs), network-based semantic grammars,
case frame grammars, pattern matching and determin-
istic parsers.
Recently, Shriberg et al. (1992) and Bear et
al. (1992) have proposed a two-stage method for pro-
cessing repairs. In the first stage, lexical pattern

<bodyText confidence="0.990809756410256">
matching rules operating on orthographic transcrip-
tions would be used to retrieve candidate repair utter-
ances. In the second, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic
information would filter true repairs from false posi-
tives found by the pattern matcher. Results of testing
the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher,
are reported in (Bear et al., 1992): 309 of 406 utterance
containing &apos;nontrivial&apos; repairs in their 10,718 utterance
corpus were correctly identified, while 191 fluent utter-
ances were incorrectly identified as containing repairs.
This represents recall of 76% with precision of 62%.
Of the repairs correctly identified, the appropriate cor-
rection was found for 57%. Repair candidates were
filtered and corrected by deleting a portion of the ut-
terance based on the pattern matched, and then check-
ing the syntactic and semantic acceptability of the cor-
rected version using the syntactic and semantic com-
ponents of the Gemini NLP system. Bear et al. (1992)
also speculate that acoustic information might be used
to filter out false positives for candidates matching two
of their lexical patterns — repetitions of single words
and cases of single inserted words — but do not report
such experimentation.
This work promotes the important idea that auto-
matic repair processing can be made more robust by
integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Such
integration is a desirable long-term goal. However,
the working assumption that correct transcriptions will
be available from speech recognizers is problematic,
since current recognition systems rely primarily upon
language models and lexicons derived from fluent
speech to decide among competing acoustic hypothe-
ses. These systems usually treat disfluencies in training
and recognition as noise; moreover, they have no way
of modeling word fragments, even though these occur
in the majority of repairs. We term such approaches
that rely on accurate transcription to identify repair
candidates &amp;quot;text-first&amp;quot;.
Text-first approaches have explored the potential
contributions of lexical and grammatical information
to automatic repair processing, but have largely left
open the question of whether there exist acoustic and
prosodic cues for repairs in general, rather than po-
tential acoustic-prosodic filters for particular pattern
subclasses. Our investigation of repairs addresses the
problem of identifying such general acoustic-prosodic
cues to repairs, and so we term our approach &amp;quot;speech-
first&amp;quot;. Finding such cues to repairs would provide early
detection of repairs in recognition, permitting early
pruning of the hypothesis space.
One proposal for repair processing that lends it-
self to both incremental processing and the integration
of speech cues into repair detection is that of Hindle
(1983), who defines a typology of repairs and asso-
ciated correction strategies in terms of extensions to
a deterministic parser. For Hindle, repairs can be (1)
full sentence restarts, in which an entire utterance is re-
initiated; (2) constituent repairs, in which one syntactic
constituent (or part thereof) is replaced by another:2 or
(3) surface level repairs, in which identical strings ap-
pear adjacent to each other. An hypothesized acoustic-
phonetic edit signal, &amp;quot;a markedly abrupt cut-off of
the speech signal&amp;quot; (Hindle, 1983, p.123), is assumed
to mark the interruption of fluent speech (cf. (Labov,
1966)). This signal is treated as a special lexical item in
the parser input stream that triggers certain correction
strategies depending on the parser configuration. Thus,
in Hindle&apos;s system, repair detection is decoupled from
repair correction, which requires only that the location
of the interruption is stored in the parser state.
Importantly, Hindle&apos;s system allows for non-
surface-based corrections and sequential application
of correction rules (Hindle, 1983, p. 123). In con-
trast, simple surface deletion correction strategies can-
not readily handle either repairs in which one syntactic
constituent is replaced by an entirely different one, as
in Example (4), or sequences of overlapping repairs,
as in Example (5).

Hindle&apos;s methods achieved a success rate of 97%
on a transcribed corpus of approximately 1,500 sen-
tences in which the edit signal was orthographically
represented and lexical and syntactic category assign-
ments hand-corrected, indicating that, in theory, the
edit signal can be computationally exploited for both
repair detection and correction. Our &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; in-
vestigation of repairs is aimed at determining the extent
to which repair processing algorithms can rely on the
edit signal hypothesis in practice.

The Repair Interval Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994771625">
To support our investigation of acoustic-prosodic cues
to repair detection, we propose a &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; model
of repairs, the REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL (RIM). RIM di-
vides the repair event into three consecutive temporal
intervals and identifies time points within those inter-
vals that are computationally critical. A full repair
comprises three intervals, the REPARANDUM INTERVAL,
the DISFLUENCY INTERVAL, and the REPAIR INTERVAL.
Following Levelt (1983), we identify the REPARANDUM
as the lexical material which is to be repaired. The end
of the reparandum coincides with the termination of
the fluent portion of the utterance, which we term the
INTERRUPTION SITE (IS). The DISFLUENCY INTERVAL
(DI) extends from the Is to the resumption of fluent
speech, and may contain any combination of silence,
pause fillers (&apos;uh&apos;,`um&apos;), or CUE PHRASES (e.g., &apos;Clops&apos;

<footnote confidence="0.9856805">
2This is consistent with Levelt (1983)&apos;s observation that
the material to be replaced and the correcting material in a
repair often share structural properties akin to those shared
by coordinated constituents.

or &apos;I mean&apos;), which indicate the speaker&apos;s recognition
of his/her performance error. The REPAIR INTERVAL
corresponds to the utterance of the correcting material,
which is intended to &apos;replace&apos; the reparandum. It ex-
tends from the offset of the DI to the resumption of
non-repair speech. In Example (6), for example, the
reparandum occurs from 1 to 2, the DI from 2 to 3, and
the repair interval from 3 to 4; the Is occurs at 2.

RIM provides a framework for testing the extent
to which cues from the speech signal contribute to
the identification and correction of repair utterances.
RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle
(1983): (1) correction strategies are linguistically rule-
governed, and (2) linguistic cues must be available to
signal when a disfluency has occurred and to &apos;trigger&apos;
correction strategies. As Hindle noted, if the process-
ing of disfluencies were not rule-governed, it would
be difficult to reconcile the infrequent intrusion of dis-
fluencies on human speech comprehension, especially
for language learners, with their frequent rate of oc-
currence in spontaneous speech. We view Hindle&apos;s
results as evidence supporting (1). Our study tests
(2) by exploring the acoustic and prosodic features of
repairs that might serve as a form of edit signal for
rule-governed correction strategies.
While Labov and Hindle proposed that an
acoustic-phonetic cue might exist at precisely the is,
based on our analyses and on recent psycholinguistic
experiments (Lickley et al., 1991), this proposal ap-
pears too limited. Crucially, in RIM, we extend the
notion of edit signal to include any phenomenon which
may contribute to the perception of an &amp;quot;abrupt cut-off&apos;
of the speech signal — including cues such as coartic-
ulation phenomena, word fragments, interruption glot-
talization, pause, and prosodic cues which occur in the
vicinity of the disfluency interval. RIM thus acknowl-
edges the edit signal hypothesis, that some aspect of
the speech signal may demarcate the computationally
key juncture between the reparandum and repair inter-
vals, while extending its possible acoustic and prosodic
manifestations.

Acoustic-Prosodic Characteristics of
Repairs

We studied the acoustic and prosodic correlates of
repair events as defined in the RIM framework with
the aim of identifying potential cues for automatic re-
pair processing, extending a pilot study reported in
(Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993). Our corpus for the
current study consisted of 6,414 utterances produced
by 123 speakers from the ARPA Airline Travel and In-
formation System (Aus) database (MADCOW, 1992)
collected at AT&amp;T, BBN, CMU, SRI, and TI. 334 (5.2%)
of these utterances contain at least one repair, where
repair is defined as the self-correction of one or more
phonemes (up to and including sequences of words)
in an utterance.3 Orthographic transcriptions of the
utterances were prepared by ARPA contractors accord-
ing to standardized conventions. The utterances were
labeled at Bell Laboratories for word boundaries and
intonational prominences and phrasing following Pier-
rehumbert&apos;s description of English intonation (Pierre-
humbert, 1980). Also, each of the three RIM intervals
and prosodic and acoustic events within those intervals
were labeled.

Identifying the Reparandum Interval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999935">
Our acoustic and prosodic analysis of the reparan-
dum interval focuses on acoustic-phonetic properties
of word fragments, as well as additional phonetic cues
marking the reparandum offset. From the point of view
of repair detection and correction, acoustic-prosodic
cues to the onset of the reparandum would clearly be
useful in the choice of appropriate correction strat-
egy. However, recent perceptual experiments indicate
that humans do not detect an oncoming disfluency as
early as the onset of the reparandum (Lickley et al.,
1991; Lickley and Bard, 1992). Subjects were gen-
erally able to detect disfluencies before lexical access
of the first word in the repair. However, since only
a small number of the test stimuli employed in these
experiments contained reparanda ending in word frag-
ments (Lickley et al., 1991), it is not clear how to
generalize results to such repairs. In our corpus, 74%
of all reparanda end in word fragments.4
Since the majority of our repairs involve word frag-
mentation, we analyzed several lexical and acoustic-
phonetic properties of fragments for potential use in
fragment identification. Table 1 shows the broad word
class of the speaker&apos;s intended word for each fragment,
where the intended word was recoverable. There is

a clear tendency for fragmentation at the reparandum
offset to occur in content words rather than function

31n our pilot study of the SRI and TI utterances only, we
found that repairs occurred in 9.1% of utterances (Nakatani
and Hirschberg, 1993). This rate is probably more accurate
than the 5.2% we find in our current corpus, since repairs for
the pilot study were identified from more detailed transcrip-
tions than were available for the larger corpus.

sonant fragments occur more than six times as often as
fricatives than as stops. However, fricatives and stops
occur almost equally as the initial consonant in single
syllable fragments. Furthermore, we observe two di-
vergences from the underlying distributions of initial
phonemes for all words in the corpus. Vowel-initial
words show less tendency and fricative-initial words
show a greater tendency to occur as fragments, relative
to the underlying distributions for those classes.
Two additional acoustic-phonetic cues, glottaliza-
tion and coarticulation, may help in fragment identi-
fication. Bear et al. (1992) note that INTERRUPTION
GLoTrAuzATioN (irregular glottal pulses) sometimes
occurs at the reparandum offset. This form of glot-
talization is acoustically distinct from LARYNGEALIZA-
TION (creaky voice), which often occurs at the end of
prosodic phrases; GLOTTAL STOPS, which often pre-
cede vowel-initial words; and EPENTHETIC GLOTTAL-
IZATION. In our corpus, 30.2% of reparanda offsets
are marked by interruption glottalization.5 Although
interruption glottalization is usually associated with
fragments, not all fragments are glottalized. In our
database, 62% of fragments are not glottalized, and
9% of glottalized reparanda offsets are not fragments.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.886485">
5Shriberg et al. (1992) report glottalization on 24 of 25

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995206">
Also, sonorant endings of fragments in our corpus
sometimes exhibit coarticulatory effects of an unre-
alized subsequent phoneme. When these effects occur
with a following pause (see below), they can be used
to distinguish fragments from full phrase-final words
— such as &apos;flu–&apos; from &apos;fly&apos; in Example (1).
To summarize, our corpus shows that most
reparanda offsets end in word fragments. These frag-
ments are usually fragments of content words (based
upon transcribers&apos; identification of intended words in
our corpus), are rarely more than one syllable long,
exhibit different distributions of initial phoneme class
depending on their length, and are sometimes glottal-
ized and sometimes exhibit coarticulatory effects of
missing subsequent phonemes. These findings suggest
that it is unlikely that word-based recognition mod-
els can be applied directly to the problem of fragment
identification. Rather, models for fragment identifica-
tion might make use of initial phoneme distributions,
in combination with information on fragment length
and acoustic-phonetic events at the Is. Inquiry into
the articulatory bases of several of these properties of
self-interrupted speech, such as glottalization and ini-
tial phoneme distributions, may further improve the
modeling of fragments.

Identifying the Disfluency Interval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887">
In the RIM model, the DI includes all cue phrases and
filled and unfilled pauses from the offset of the reparan-
dum to the onset of the repair. The literature contains a
number of hypotheses about this interval (cf. (Black-
mer and Mitton, 1991). For our corpus, pause fillers
or cue words, which have been hypothesized as repair
cues, occur within the DI for only 9.8% (332/368) of
repairs, and so cannot be relied on for repair detection.
Our findings do, however, support a new hypothesis
associating fragment repairs and the duration of pause
following the Is.
Table 4 shows the average duration of &apos;silent DI&apos;S
(those not containing pause fillers or cue words) com-
pared to that of fluent utterance-internal silent pauses
for the TI utterances. Overall, silent DIs are shorter

we analyze repair utterances based on occurrence of
fragments, the DI duration for fragment repairs is
significantly shorter than for nonfragments (p&lt;.001,
tstat=3.36, df=330). The fragment repair DI duration
is also significantly shorter than fluent pause intervals

utterances. So, DIS in general appear to be distinct from
fluent pauses, and the duration of DIS in fragment re-
pairs might also be exploited to identify these cases as
repairs, as well as to distinguish them from nonfrag-
ment repairs. Thus, pausal duration may serve as a
general acoustic cue for repair detection, particularly
for the class of fragment repairs.

Identifying the Repair
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999784639175258">
Several influential studies of acoustic-prosodic repair
cues have relied upon lexical, semantic, and prag-
matic definitions of repair types (Levelt and Cutler,
1983; Levelt, 1983). Levelt &amp; Cutler (1983) claim that
repairs of erroneous information (ERROR REPAIRS) are
marked by increased intonational prominence on the
correcting information, while other kinds of repairs,
such as additions to descriptions (APPROPRIATENESS
REPAIRS), generally are not. We investigated whether
the repair interval is marked by special intonational
prominence relative to the reparandum for all repairs
in our corpus and for these particular classes of repair.
To obtain objective measures of relative promi-
nence, we compared absolute 10 and energy in the
sonorant center of the last accented lexical item in the
reparandum with that of the first accented item in the
repair interval.6 We found a small but reliable increase
in ID from the end of the reparandum to the beginning of
the repair (mean=4.1 Hz, p&lt;.01, tstat=2.49, df=327).
There was also a small but reliable increase in ampli-
tude across the DI (mean=+1.5 db, p&lt;.001, tstat=6.07,
df=327). We analyzed the same phenomena across
utterance-internal fluent pauses for the ATIS TI set and
found no reliable differences in either f0 or intensity,
although this may have been due to the greater variabil-
ity in the fluent population. And when we compared
the ID and amplitude changes from reparandum to re-
pair with those observed for fluent pauses, we found no
significant differences between the two populations.
So, while differences in ID and amplitude exist
between the reparandum offset and the repair onset,
we conclude that these differences are too small help
distinguish repairs from fluent speech. Although it is
not entirely straightforward to compare our objective
measures of intonational prominence with Levelt and
Cutler&apos;s perceptual findings, our results provide only
weak support for theirs. And while we find small but
significant changes in two correlates of intonational
prominence, the distributions of change in f0 and en-
ergy for our data are unimodal; when we further test
subclasses of Levelt and Cutler&apos;s error repairs and ap-
propriateness repairs, statistical analysis does not sup-

port Levelt and Cutler&apos;s claim that the former — and
only the former — group is intonationally &apos;marked&apos;.
Previous studies of disfluency have paid consider-
able attention to the vicinity of the DI but little to the
repair offset. Although we did not find comparative in-
tonational prominence across the DI to be a promising
cue for repair detection, our RIM analysis uncovered
one general intonational cue that may be of use for
repair correction, namely the prosodic phrasing of the
repair interval. We propose that phrase boundaries at
the repair offset can serve to delimit the region over
which subsequent correction strategies may operate.
We tested the idea that repair interval offsets
are intonationally marked by either minor or major
prosodic phrase boundaries in two ways. First, we used
the phrase prediction procedure reported by Wang &amp;
Hirschberg (1992) to estimate whether the phrasing at
the repair offset was predictable according to a model
of fluent phrasing.7 Second, we analyzed the syntactic
and lexical properties of the first major or minor intona-
tional phrase including all or part of the repair interval
to determine whether such phrasal units corresponded
to different types of repairs in terms of Hindle&apos;s typol-
ogy.
The first analysis tested the hypothesis that repair
interval offsets are intonationally delimited by minor or
major prosodic phrase boundaries. We found that the
repair offset co-occurs with minor phrase boundaries
for 49% of repairs in the TI set. To see whether these
boundaries were distinct from those in fluent speech,
we compared the phrasing of repair utterances with
the phrasing predicted for the corresponding corrected
version of the utterance identified by ATIS transcribers.
For 40% of all repairs, an observed boundary occurs at
the repair offset where one is predicted; and for 33%
of all repairs, no boundary is observed where none
is predicted. For the remaining 27% of repairs for
which predicted phrasing diverged from observed, in
10% of cases a boundary occurred where none was
predicted and in 17%, no boundary occurred when one
was predicted.
In addition to differences at the repair offset,
we also found more general differences from pre-
dicted phrasing over the entire repair interval, which
we hypothesize may be partly understood as follows:
Two strong predictors of prosodic phrasing in flu-
ent speech are syntactic constituency (Cooper and
Sorenson, 1977; Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Selkirk,
1984), especially the relative inviolability of noun
phrases (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992), and the length of
prosodic phrases (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko

the Arts TI corpus using only features whose values could be
calculated via automatic text analysis. Results reported here

and Fitzpatrick, 1990). On the one hand, we found oc-
currences of phrase boundaries at repair offsets which
occurred within larger NPs, as in Example (7), where
it is precisely the noun modifier — not the entire noun
phrase — which is correctec1.8

We speculate that, by marking off the modifier intona-
tionally, a speaker may signal that operations relating
just this phrase to earlier portions of the utterance can
achieve the proper correction of the disfluency. We
also found cases of &apos;lengthened&apos; intonational phrases
in repair intervals, as illustrated in the single-phrase
reparandum in (8), where the corresponding fluent ver-
sion of the reparandum is predicted to contain four
phrases.
(8) What airport is it I is located I what is the name
of the airport located in San Francisco
Again, we hypothesize that the role played by this un-
usually long phrase is the same as that of early phrase
boundaries in NPS discussed above. In both cases, the
phrase boundary delimits a meaningful unit for sub-
sequent correction strategies. For example, we might
understand the multiple repairs in (8) as follows: First
the speaker attempts a VP repair, with the repair phrase
delimited by a single prosodic phrase &apos;is located&apos;. Then
the initially repaired utterance &apos;What airport is located&apos;
is itself repaired, with the reparadum again delimited
by a single prosodic phrase, &apos;What is the name of the
airport located in San Francisco&apos;.
In the second analysis of lexical and syntactic
properties, we found three major classes of phras-
ing behaviors, all involving the location of the first
phrase boundary after the repair onset: First, for 44%
(163/368) of repairs, the repair offset we had initially
identified9 coincides with a phrase boundary, which
can thus be said to mark off the repair interval. Of the
remaining 205 repairs, more than two-thirds (140/205)
have the first phrase boundary after the repair onset
at the right edge of a syntactic constituent. We pro-
pose that this class of repairs should be identified as
constituent repairs, rather than the lexical repairs we
had initially hypothesized. For the majority of these
constituent repairs (79%, 110/140), the repair interval
contains a well-formed syntactic constituent (see Ta-
ble 5). If the repair interval does not form a syntactic
constituent, it is most often an NP-internal repair (77%,
23/30). The third class of repairs includes those in
which the first boundary after the repair onset occurs
neither at the repair offset nor at the right edge of a syn-
tactic constituent. This class contains surface or lexical

repairs (where the first phrase boundary in the repair
interval delimits a sequence of one or more repeated
words), phonetic errors, word insertions, and syntactic
reformulations (as in Example (4)). It might be noted
here that, in general, repairs involving correction of
either verb phrases or verbs are far less common than
those involving noun phrases, prepositional phrases, or
sentences.
We briefly note evidence against one alternative
(although not mutually exclusive) hypothesis, that the
region to be delimited correction strategies is marked
not by a phrase boundary near the repair offset, but by
a phrase boundary at the onset of the reparandum. In
other words, it may be the reparandum interval, not the
repair interval, that is intonationally delimited. How-
ever, it is often the case that the last phrase boundary
before the Is occurs at the left edge of a major syn-
tactic constituent (42%, (87/205), even though major
constituent repairs are about one third as frequent in
this corpus (15%, 31/205). In contrast, phrase bound-
aries occur at the left edge of minor constituents 27%
(55/205) of the time, whereas minor constituent re-
pairs make up 39% (79/205) of the subcorpus at hand.
We take these figures as general evidence against the
outlined alternative hypothesis, establishing that the
demarcation repair offset is a more productive goal for
repair processing algorithms.
Investigation of repair phrasing in other corpora
covering a wider variety of genres is needed in order
to assess the generality of these findings. For exam-
ple, 35% (8/23) of NP-internal constituent repairs oc-
curred within cardinal compounds, which are prevalent
in the ATIS corpus due to its domain. The preponder-
ance of temporal and locative prepositional phrases
may also be attributed to the nature of the task and
domain. Nonetheless, the fact that repair offsets in our
corpus are marked by intonational phrase boundaries
in such a large percentage of cases (82.3%, 303/368),
suggests that this is a possibility worth pursuing.

from RIM analysis of the Aris corpus would transfer
to a predictive model for repairs in that domain. We
examined 374 ATIS repair utterances, including the 334
upon which the descriptive study presented above was
based. We used the 172 Ti and SRI repair utterances
from our earlier pilot study (Nakatani and Hirschberg,
1993) as training date; these served a similar purpose
in the descriptive analysis presented above. We then
tested on the additional 202 repair utterances, which
contained 223 repair instances. In our predictions we
attemped to distinguish repair is from fluent phrase
boundaries (collapsing major and minor boundaries),
non-repair disfluencies,1° and simple word boundaries.
We considered every word boundary to be a potential
repair site.11 Data points are represented below as
ordered pairs &lt;wi,wi &gt;, where wi represents the lexical
item to the left of the potential Is and w represents that
on the right.
For each &lt;wi,wi &gt;, we examined the following
features as potential Is predictors: (a) duration of pause
between wi and w5; (b) occurrence of a word frag-
ment(s) within &lt;wi,w; &gt;; (c) occurrence of a filled
pause in &lt;wi,wj &gt;; (d) amplitude (energy) peak within
wi, both absolute and normalized for the utterance; (e)
amplitude of wi relative to wi_1 and to nij; (f) abso-
lute and normalized ID of wi; (g) f0 of wi relative to
wi-1 and to wi ; and (h) whether or not wi was ac-
cented, deaccented, or deaccented and cliticized. We
also simulated some simple pattern matching strate-
gies, to try to determine how acoustic-prosodic cues
might interact with lexical cues in repair identification.
To this end, we looked at (i) the distance in words of
wi from the beginning and end of the utterance; (j) the
total number of words in the utterance; and (k) whether
wi or wi_1 recurred in the utterance within a window
of three words after wi. We were unable to test all
the acoustic-prosodic features we examined in our de-
scriptive analysis, since features such as glottalization
and coarticulatory effects had not been labeled in our
data base for locations other than DIs. Also, we used
fairly crude measures to approximate features such as
change in f0 and amplitude, since these .too had been
precisely labeled in our corpus only for repair locations
and not for fluent speech.12
We trained prediction trees, using Classification
and Regression Tree (CART) techniques (Brieman et
al., 1984), on our 172-utterance training set. We first
included all our potential identifiers as possible predic-
tors. The resulting (automatically generated) decision
tree was then used to predict Is locations in our 202-

including all events with some phonetic indicator of disflu-
ency which was not involved in a self-repair, such as hesita-
tions marked with audible breath or sharp cut-off.

11We also included utterance-final boundaries as data

utterance test set. This procedure identified 186 of the
223 repairs correctly, while predicting 12 false posi-
tives and omitting 37 true repairs, for a recall of 83.4%
and precision of 93.9%. Fully 177 of the correctly
identified ISS were identified via presence of word frag-
ments as well as duration of pause in the DI. Repairs
not containing fragments were identified from lexical
matching plus pausal duration in the DI.
Since the automatic identification of word frag-
ments from speech is an unsolved problem, we next
omitted the fragment feature and tried the prediction
again. The best prediction tree, tested on the same
202-utterance test set, succeeded in identifying 174 of
repairs correctly — in the absence of fragment informa-
tion — with 21 false positives and 49 omissions (78.1%
recall, 89.2% precision). The correctly identified re-
pairs were all characterized by constraints on duration
of pause in the DI. Some were further identified via
presence of lexical match to the right of wi within the
window of three described above, and word position
within utterance. Those repairs in which no lexical
match was identified were characterized by lower am-
plitude of wi relative to wi and cliticization or deac-
centing of wi. Still other repairs were characterized by
more complex series of lexical and acoustic-prosodic
constraints.
These results are, of course, very preliminary.
Larger corpora must certainly be examined and more
sophisticated versions of the crude measures we have
used should be employed. However, as a first ap-
proximation to the characterization of repairs via both
acoustic-prosodic and lexical cues, we find these re-
sults encouraging. In particular, our ability to iden-
tify repair sites successfully without relying upon the
identification of fragments as such seems promising,
although our analysis of fragments suggests that there
may indeed be ways of identifying fragment repairs,
via their relatively short DI, for example. Also, the
combination of general acoustic-prosodic constraints
with lexical pattern matching techniques as a strategy
for repair identification appears to gain some support
from our predictions. Further work on prediction mod-
eling may suggest ways of combining these lexical and
acoustic-prosodic cues for repair processing.

In this paper, we have presented a &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; model,
the Repair Interval Model, for studying repairs in spon-
taneous speech. This model divides the repair event
into a reparandum interval, a disfluency interval, and
a repair interval. We have presented empirical results
from acoustic-phonetic and prosodic analysis of a cor-
pus of repairs in spontaneous speech, indicating that
reparanda offsets end in word fragments, usually of(in-
tended) content words, and that these fragments tend
to be quite short and to exhibit particular acoustic-
phonetic characteristics. We found that the disfluency

interval can be distinguished from intonational phrase
boundaries in fluent speech in terms of duration of
pause, and that fragment and nonfragment repairs can
also be distinguished from one another in terms of the
duration of the disfluency interval. For our corpus,
repair onsets can be distinguished from reparandum
offsets by small but reliable differences in ID and am-
plitude, and repair intervals differ from fluent speech
in their characteristic prosodic phrasing. We tested
our results by developing predictive models for repairs
in the ATIS domain, using CART analysis; the best per-
forming prediction strategies, trained on a subset of our
data, identified repairs in the remaining utterances with
recall of 78-83% and precision of 89-93%, depending
upon features examined.

However, while corpus studies have shown that about 10% of spontaneous utterances contain self-corrections, or RE- PAIRS, little is known about the extent to which cues in the speech signal may facilitate repair processing. We identify several cues based on acoustic and prosodic analysis of repairs in a corpus of spontaneous speech, and propose methods for exploiting these cues to detect and correct repairs. We test our acoustic-prosodic cues with other lexical cues to repair identification and find that precision rates of 89-93% and recall of 78-83% can be achieved, depending upon the cues employed, from a prosodically labeled corpus.</abstract>

Previous Computational Approaches While self-correction has long been a topic of psycholinguistic study, computational work in this area has been sparse. Early work in computational linguistics treated repairs as one type of ill-formed input and proposed solutions based upon extensions to existing text parsing techniques such as augmented transition networks (ATNs), network-based semantic grammars, case frame grammars, pattern matching and deterministic parsers. Recently, Shriberg et al. (1992) and Bear et al. (1992) have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs. In the first stage, lexical pattern 46 matching rules operating on orthographic transcriptions would be used to retrieve candidate repair utterances. In the second, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information would filter true repairs from false positives found by the pattern matcher. Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al., 1992): 309 of 406 utterance containing &apos;nontrivial&apos; repairs in their 10,718 utterance corpus were correctly identified, while 191 fluent utteranc</context>

However, fricatives and stops occur almost equally as the initial consonant in single syllable fragments. Furthermore, we observe two divergences from the underlying distributions of initial phonemes for all words in the corpus. Vowel-initial words show less tendency and fricative-initial words show a greater tendency to occur as fragments, relative to the underlying distributions for those classes. Two additional acoustic-phonetic cues, glottalization and coarticulation, may help in fragment identification. Bear et al. (1992) note that INTERRUPTION GLoTrAuzATioN (irregular glottal pulses) sometimes occurs at the reparandum offset. This form of glottalization is acoustically distinct from LARYNGEALIZATION (creaky voice), which often occurs at the end of prosodic phrases; GLOTTAL STOPS, which often precede vowel-initial words; and EPENTHETIC GLOTTALIZATION. In our corpus, 30.2% of reparanda offsets are marked by interruption glottalization.5 Although interruption glottalization is usually associated with fragments, not all fragments are glottalized. In our database, 62% of fragments are not glottalized, and 9% of gl</context>

Inquiry into the articulatory bases of several of these properties of self-interrupted speech, such as glottalization and initial phoneme distributions, may further improve the modeling of fragments. Identifying the Disfluency Interval In the RIM model, the DI includes all cue phrases and filled and unfilled pauses from the offset of the reparandum to the onset of the repair. The literature contains a number of hypotheses about this interval (cf. (Blackmer and Mitton, 1991). For our corpus, pause fillers or cue words, which have been hypothesized as repair cues, occur within the DI for only 9.8% (332/368) of repairs, and so cannot be relied on for repair detection. Our findings do, however, support a new hypothesis associating fragment repairs and the duration of pause following the Is. Table 4 shows the average duration of &apos;silent DI&apos;S (those not containing pause fillers or cue words) compared to that of fluent utterance-internal silent pauses for the TI utterances.

Our investigation of repairs addresses the problem of identifying such general acoustic-prosodic cues to repairs, and so we term our approach &amp;quot;speechfirst&amp;quot;. Finding such cues to repairs would provide early detection of repairs in recognition, permitting early pruning of the hypothesis space. One proposal for repair processing that lends itself to both incremental processing and the integration of speech cues into repair detection is that of Hindle (1983), who defines a typology of repairs and associated correction strategies in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser. For Hindle, repairs can be (1) full sentence restarts, in which an entire utterance is reinitiated; (2) constituent repairs, in which one syntactic constituent (or part thereof) is replaced by another:2 or (3) surface level repairs, in which identical strings appear adjacent to each other.

RIM provides a framework for testing the extent to which cues from the speech signal contribute to the identification and correction of repair utterances. RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle (1983): (1) correction strategies are linguistically rulegoverned, and (2) linguistic cues must be available to signal when a disfluency has occurred and to &apos;trigger&apos; correction strategies. As Hindle noted, if the processing of disfluencies were not rule-governed, it would be difficult to reconcile the infrequent intrusion of disfluencies on human speech comprehension, especially for language learners, with their frequent rate of occurrence in spontaneous speech.

The Repair Interval Model To support our investigation of acoustic-prosodic cues to repair detection, we propose a &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; model of repairs, the REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL (RIM). RIM divides the repair event into three consecutive temporal intervals and identifies time points within those intervals that are computationally critical. A full repair comprises three intervals, the REPARANDUM INTERVAL, the DISFLUENCY INTERVAL, and the REPAIR INTERVAL. Following Levelt (1983), we identify the REPARANDUM as the lexical material which is to be repaired. The end of the reparandum coincides with the termination of the fluent portion of the utterance, which we term the INTERRUPTION SITE (IS). The DISFLUENCY INTERVAL (DI) extends from the Is to the resumption of fluent speech, and may contain any combination of silence, pause fillers (&apos;uh&apos;,`um&apos;), or CUE PHRASES (e.g., &apos;Clops&apos; 2This is consistent with Levelt (1983)&apos;s observation that the material to be replaced and the correcting material in a repair often share structural properties akin to those shared by coordinated c</context>

The utterances were labeled at Bell Laboratories for word boundaries and intonational prominences and phrasing following Pierrehumbert&apos;s description of English intonation (Pierrehumbert, 1980). Also, each of the three RIM intervals and prosodic and acoustic events within those intervals were labeled. Identifying the Reparandum Interval Our acoustic and prosodic analysis of the reparandum interval focuses on acoustic-phonetic properties of word fragments, as well as additional phonetic cues marking the reparandum offset. From the point of view of repair detection and correction, acoustic-prosodic cues to the onset of the reparandum would clearly be useful in the choice of appropriate correction strategy. However, recent perceptual experiments indicate that humans do not detect an on</context>

Although studies of large speech corpora have found that approximately 10% of spontaneous utterances contain disfluencies involving self-correction, or REPAIRS (Hindle, 1983; Shriberg et al., 1992), little is known about how to integrate repair processing with real-time speech recognition. In particular, the speech signal itself has been relatively unexplored as a source of processing cues for the detection and correction of repairs. In this paper, we present results from a study of the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of 334 repair utterances, containing 368 repair instances, from the A RPA Air Travel Information System (Ails) database. Our results are interpreted within our &amp;quot;speech-first&amp;quot; framework for investigating repairs, the REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL (RIM). RIM builds upon Labov </context>

Previous Computational Approaches While self-correction has long been a topic of psycholinguistic study, computational work in this area has been sparse. Early work in computational linguistics treated repairs as one type of ill-formed input and proposed solutions based upon extensions to existing text parsing techniques such as augmented transition networks (ATNs), network-based semantic grammars, case frame grammars, pattern matching and deterministic parsers. Recently, Shriberg et al. (1992) and Bear et al. (1992) have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs. In the first stage, lexical pattern 46 matching rules operating on orthographic transcriptions would be used to retrieve candidate repair utterances. In the second, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information would filter true repairs from false positives found by the pattern matcher. Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al., 1992): 309 of 406 utterance containing &apos;nontrivial&apos; repairs in their 10,718 utterance corpus were correctly identified, wh</context>

This rate is probably more accurate than the 5.2% we find in our current corpus, since repairs for the pilot study were identified from more detailed transcriptions than were available for the larger corpus. 4Shriberg et al.

This form of glottalization is acoustically distinct from LARYNGEALIZATION (creaky voice), which often occurs at the end of prosodic phrases; GLOTTAL STOPS, which often precede vowel-initial words; and EPENTHETIC GLOTTALIZATION. In our corpus, 30.2% of reparanda offsets are marked by interruption glottalization.5 Although interruption glottalization is usually associated with fragments, not all fragments are glottalized. In our database, 62% of fragments are not glottalized, and 9% of glottalized reparanda offsets are not fragments. 5Shriberg et al. (1992) report glottalization on 24 of 25 vowel-final fragments. Also, sonorant endings of fragments in our corpus sometimes exhibit coarticulatory effects of an unrealized subsequent phoneme. When these effects occur with a following pause (see below), they can be used to distinguish fragments from full phrase-final words — such as &apos;flu–&apos; from &apos;fly&apos; in Example (1). To summarize, our corpus shows that most reparanda offsets end in word fragments. These fragments are usually fragments of content words (based upon transcribers&apos; identification of intended words in our corpus), are rarely more than one s</context>

In addition to differences at the repair offset, we also found more general differences from predicted phrasing over the entire repair interval, which we hypothesize may be partly understood as follows: Two strong predictors of prosodic phrasing in fluent speech are syntactic constituency (Cooper and Sorenson, 1977; Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Selkirk, 1984), especially the relative inviolability of noun phrases (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992), and the length of prosodic phrases (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko 7Wang &amp; Hirschberg use statistical modeling techniques to predict phrasing from a large corpus of labeled ATIS speech; we used a prediction tree that achieves 88.4% accuracy on the Arts TI corpus using only features whose values could be calculated via automatic text analysis. Results reported here are for prediction on only TI repair utterances. 50 and Fitzpatrick, 1990).

We propose that phrase boundaries at the repair offset can serve to delimit the region over which subsequent correction strategies may operate. We tested the idea that repair interval offsets are intonationally marked by either minor or major prosodic phrase boundaries in two ways. First, we used the phrase prediction procedure reported by Wang &amp; Hirschberg (1992) to estimate whether the phrasing at the repair offset was predictable according to a model of fluent phrasing.7 Second, we analyzed the syntactic and lexical properties of the first major or minor intonational phrase including all or part of the repair interval to determine whether such phrasal units corresponded to different types of repairs in terms of Hindle&apos;s typology. The first analysis tested the hypothesis that repair interval offsets are intonationally delimited by minor or major prosodic phrase boundaries.
