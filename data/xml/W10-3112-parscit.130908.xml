Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999874392857143">
The correct interpretation of biomedical texts
by text mining systems requires the recogni-
tion of a range of types of high-level informa-
tion (or meta-knowledge) about the text. Ex-
amples include expressions of negation and
speculation, as well as pragmatic/rhetorical in-
tent (e.g. whether the information expressed
represents a hypothesis, generally accepted
knowledge, new experimental knowledge,
etc.) Although such types of information have
previously been annotated at the text-span
level (most commonly sentences), annotation
at the level of the event is currently quite
sparse. In this paper, we focus on the evalua-
tion of the multi-dimensional annotation
scheme that we have developed specifically
for enriching bio-events with meta-knowledge
information. Our annotation scheme is in-
tended to be general enough to allow integra-
tion with different types of bio-event annota-
tion, whilst being detailed enough to capture
important subtleties in the nature of the meta-
knowledge expressed in the text. To our
knowledge, our scheme is unique within the
field with regards to the diversity of meta-
knowledge aspects annotated for each event,
whilst the evaluation results have confirmed
its feasibility and soundness.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990039215686">
The ability to recognise high-level information
(or meta-knowledge) relating to the interpreta-
tion of texts is an important task for text mining
systems. There are several types of meta-
knowledge that fall under this category. For ex-
ample, the detection of expressions of specula-
tion and negation is important across all do-
mains, although the way in which these phenom-
ena are expressed may be domain-specific. In
scientific texts, it is also important to be able to
determine other types of information, such as the
author‟s rhetorical/pragmatic intent (de Waard et
al., 2009). This would correspond to whether the
information expressed represents a hypothesis,
accepted knowledge, new experimental knowl-
edge, etc.
The ability to distinguish between these dif-
ferent types of information can be important for
tasks such as building and updating models of
biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al.,
2008), and curation of biological databases
(Ashburner et al., 2000). Central to both of these
tasks is the identification of new knowledge that
can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon
an existing, but incomplete model of a biological
process (Lisacek et al., 2005) or to ensure that
the database is kept up to date. Any new knowl-
edge added should be supported though evi-
dence, which could include linking hypotheses
with experimental findings. It is also important to
take into account inconsistencies and contradic-
tions reported in the literature.
The production of annotated corpora can help
to train text mining systems to recognise types of
meta-knowledge, such as the above. Although a
number of such corpora have already been pro-
duced, different annotation schemes are required
according to the exact domain under considera-
tion, as well as the types of task that will be un-
dertaken by the text mining system.
The work described in this paper is focused on
the design and evaluation of the meta-knowledge
annotation scheme described in Nawaz et al.,
(2010). The annotation scheme has been specifi-
cally designed to recognise a range of meta-
knowledge types for events extracted from bio-
medical texts (henceforth bio-events). The aim is
to facilitate the development of more useful sys-
tems in the context of various biomedical infor-
mation extraction (IE) and textual inference (TI)
tasks. Although the scheme has been designed

for application to existing bio-event corpora, it is
intended to be applied to any type of bio-relation
corpora, and can easily be tailored for other types
of relations/events within the domain.

1.1 Bio-Event Representation of Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989702358974359">
Searching for relevant information in electronic
documents is most commonly carried out by en-
tering keywords into a search engine. However,
such searches will normally return a huge num-
ber of documents, many of which will be irrele-
vant to the user‟s needs.
A more promising and efficient way of search-
ing is over events that have been extracted from
texts through the application of natural language
processing methods. An event is a structured rep-
resentation of a certain piece of information con-
tained within the text, which is usually anchored
to a particular word in the text (typically a verb
or noun) that is central to the description of the
event. Events are often represented by a tem-
plate-like structure with slots that are filled by
the event participants. Each event participant is
also assigned a role within the event. These par-
ticipants can be entities, concepts or even other
events. This kind of event representation allows
the information contained in a text to be repre-
sented as a collection of nested events.
A bio-event is an event specialised for the
biomedical domain. Kim et al. (2008) define a
bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation involving
one or more participants. These participants can
be bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are each
assigned a semantic role/slot like theme and
cause etc. Each bio-event is typically assigned a
type/class from a chosen bio-event taxon-
omy/ontology, e.g., the GENIA Event Ontology
(Kim et al., 2008). Similarly, the bio-entities are
also assigned types/classes from a chosen bio-
term taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the Gene Ontol-
ogy (Ashburner et al., 2000).
As an example, consider the simple sentence
shown in Figure 1.
The results suggest that the narL gene product
activates the nitrate reductase operon.

This sentence contains a single bio-event, an-
chored to the verb activates. Figure 2 shows a
typical structured representation of this bio-
event.
The fact that the verb is anchored to the verb
activates allows the event-type of positive regu-

lation to be assigned. The event has two slots,
i.e. theme and cause whose labels help to charac-
terise the contribution that the slot filler makes
towards the meaning of the event. In this case,
the slots are filled by the subject and object of
the verb activates, both of which correspond to
different types of bio-entities (i.e. operon and
protein).
IE systems trained to extract bio-events from
texts allow users to formulate semantic queries
over the extracted events. Such queries can
specify semantic restrictions on the events in
terms of event types, semantic role labels and
named entity types etc. (Miyao et al., 2006), in
addition to particular keywords. For example, it
would be possible to search only for those texts
containing bio-events of type nega-
tive_regulation where the cause is an entity of
type protein. Such queries provide a great deal
more descriptive power than traditional keyword
searches over unstructured documents. Bio-
medical corpora that have been manually anno-
tated with event level information (e.g., Pyysalo
et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Thompson et al.,
2009) facilitate the training of systems such as
those described above.
Whilst event-based querying has advantages
for efficient searching, the extracted events have
little practical use if they are not accompanied by
meta-knowledge information to aid in their inter-
pretation.

1.2 Existing Meta-knowledge Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995819785714286">
Various corpora of biomedical literature (ab-
stracts and/or full papers) have been produced
that feature some degree of meta-knowledge an-
notation. These corpora vary in both the richness
of the annotation added, and the type/size of the
units at which the meta-knowledge annotation
has been performed. Taking the unit of annota-
tion into account, we can distinguish between
annotations that apply to continuous text-spans,
and annotations that have been performed at the
event level.
Text-Span Annotation: Such annotations have
mostly been carried out at the sentence level.
They normally concentrate on a single aspect (or
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995938">

<bodyText confidence="0.998781816326531">
dimension) of meta-knowledge, normally either
speculation/certainty level, (e.g., Light et al.,
2004; Medlock &amp; Briscoe, 2007; Vincze et al.,
2008) or general information content/rhetorical
intent, e.g., background, methods, results, in-
sights. This latter type of annotation has been
attempted both on abstracts, (e.g., McKnight &amp;
Srinivasan, 2003; Ruch et al., 2007) and full pa-
pers, (e.g. Teufel et al., 1999; Langer et al., 2004;
Mizuta &amp; Collier, 2004), with the number of dis-
tinct annotation categories varying between 4
and 14.
Despite the availability of these corpora, anno-
tation at the sentence level can often be too
granular. In terms of information content, a sen-
tence may describe, for example, both an ex-
perimental method and its results. The situation
becomes more complicated if a sentence contains
an expression of speculation. If this is only
marked at the sentence level, there may be con-
fusion about which part(s) of the sentence are
affected by the speculative expression.
Certain corpora and associated systems have
attempted to address these issues. The BioScope
corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) annotates the scopes
of negative and speculative keywords, whilst
Morante &amp; Daelemans (2009) have trained a sys-
tem to undertake this task. The scheme described
by Wilbur et al. (2006) applies annotation to
fragments of sentences, which are created on the
basis of changes in the meta-knowledge ex-
pressed. The scheme consists of multiple annota-
tion dimensions which capture aspects of both
certainty and rhetorical/pragmatic intent,
amongst other things. Training a system to auto-
matically annotate these dimensions is shown to
be highly feasible (Shatkay et al., 2008).
Event-Level Annotation: Explicit annotation of
meta-knowledge at the event-level is currently
rather minimal within biomedical corpora.
Whilst several corpora contain annotations to
distinguish positive and negative events (e.g.
Sanchez-Graillet &amp; Poesio, 2007; Pyysalo et al.,
2007), the annotation of the GENIA Event Cor-
pus (Kim et al., 2008) is slightly more extensive,
in that it additionally annotates certainty level.
To our knowledge, no existing bio-event corpus
has attempted annotation that concerns rhetori-
cal/pragmatic intent.

1.3 The Need for an Event-Centric Meta-
Knowledge Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984727272728">
In comparison to meta-knowledge annotation
carried out at the text-span level, the amount of
annotation carried out at the event level is quite
sparse. The question thus arises as to whether it
is possible to use systems trained on text-span
annotated corpora to assign meta-knowledge to
bio-events, or whether new annotation at the
event level is required.
Some corpora seem better suited to this pur-
pose than others – whilst sentence-level annota-
tions are certainly too granular for an event-
centric view of the text, sentence fragments, such
as those identified by Wilbur et al. (2006), are
likely to correspond more closely to the extent of
text that describes an event and its slots. Like-
wise, knowing the scopes of negative and specu-
lative keywords within a sentence may be a use-
ful aid in determining whether they affect the
interpretation of a particular event.
However, the information provided in these
corpora is still not sufficiently precise for event-
level meta-knowledge annotation. Even within a
text fragment, there may be several different bio-
events, each with slightly different meta-
knowledge interpretations. In a similar way, not
all events that occur within the scope of a nega-
tion or speculation keyword are necessarily af-
fected by it.
Based on these observations, we have devel-
oped a meta-knowledge annotation scheme that
is specifically tailored to bio-events. Our scheme
annotates various different aspects or dimensions
of meta-knowledge. A close examination of a
large number of relevant bio-events has resulted
in a scheme that has some similarities to previ-
ously proposed schemes, but has a number of
differences that seem especially relevant when
dealing with events, e.g. the annotation of the
manner of the event. The scheme is intended to
be general enough to allow integration with ex-
isting bio-event annotation schemes, whilst being
detailed enough to capture important subtleties in
the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed
about the event.

1.4 Lexical Markers of Meta-Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980818181818">
Most of the existing corpora mentioned above
annotate text spans or events with particular
categories (e.g. certainty level or general infor-
mation type) in different meta-knowledge di-
mensions. However, what they do not normally
do is to annotate lexical clues or keywords used
to determine the correct values.
A number of previous studies have demon-
strated the importance of lexical markers (i.e.,
words or phrases) that can accompany statements
in scientific articles in determining the intended
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992229">

<bodyText confidence="0.989503571428571">
interpretation of the text (e.g. Hyland, 1996; Ri-
zomilioti 2006). We also performed a similar
study (Thompson et al., 2008) although, in con-
trast to other studies, we took a multi-
dimensional approach to the categorisation of
such lexical items, acknowledging that several
types of important information may be expressed
through different words in the same sentence. As
an example, let us consider the example sentence
in Figure 3.
The DNA-binding properties of mutations at posi-
tions 849 and 668 may indicate that the catalytic
role of these side chains is associated with their
interaction with the DNA substrate.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.995785">

<bodyText confidence="0.9999757">
The author&apos;s pragmatic/rhetorical intent to-
wards the statement that the catalytic role of
these side chains is associated with their interac-
tion with the DNA substrate is encoded by the
word indicate, which shows that the statement
represents an analysis of the evidence stated at
the beginning of the sentence, i.e., that the muta-
tions at positions 849 and 668 have DNA-
binding properties. Furthermore, the author&apos;s
certainty level (i.e., their degree of confidence)
towards this analysis is shown by the word may.
Here, the author is uncertain about the validity of
their analysis.
Whilst our previous work served to demon-
strate that the different aspects of meta-
knowledge that can be specified lexically within
texts require a multi-dimensional analysis to cor-
rectly capture their subtleties, it showed that the
presence of particular lexical items is not the
only important feature for determining meta-
knowledge categories. In particular, their pres-
ence does not guarantee that the “expected” in-
terpretation can be assumed (Sándor, 2007). In
addition, not all types of meta-knowledge are
indicated through explicit markers. Mizuta &amp;
Collier (2004) note that rhetorical zones may be
indicated not only through explicit lexical mark-
ers, but also through features such as the main
verb in the clause and the position of the sen-
tence within the article or abstract.
For these reasons, we perform annotation on
all relevant instances, regardless of the presence
of lexical markers. This will allow systems to be
trained that can learn to determine the correct
meta-knowledge category, even when lexical
markers are not present. However, due to the
proven importance of lexical markers in deter-
mining certain meta-knowledge dimensions, our
annotation scheme annotates such markers,
whenever they are present.

2 Annotation Scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849285714286">
The annotation scheme we present here is a
slightly modified version of our original meta-
knowledge annotation scheme (Nawaz et al.,
2010). The modified scheme consists of five
meta-knowledge dimensions, each with a set of
complete and mutually-exclusive categories, i.e.,
any given bio-event belongs to exactly one cate-
gory in each dimension. Our chosen set of anno-
tation dimensions has been motivated by the
major information needs of biologists discussed
earlier, i.e., the ability to distinguish between
different intended interpretations of events.
In order to minimise the annotation burden,
the number of possible categories within each
dimension has been kept as small as possible,
whilst still respecting important distinctions in
meta-knowledge that have been observed during
our corpus study.
The advantage of using a multi-dimensional
scheme is that the interplay between different
values of each dimension can reveal both subtle
and substantial differences in the types of meta-
knowledge expressed in the surrounding text.
Therefore, in most cases, the exact rhetori-
cal/pragmatic intent of an event can only be de-
termined by considering a combination of the
values of different dimensions. This aspect of our
scheme is further discussed in section 3.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978143">
2.1 Knowledge Type (KT)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991903125">
This dimension is responsible for capturing the
general information content of the event. Whilst
less detailed than some of the previously pro-
posed sentence-level schemes, its purpose is to
form the basis of distinguishing between the
most critical types of rhetorical/pragmatic intent,
according to the needs of biologists. Each event
is thus classified into one of the following four
categories:
Investigation: Enquiries or investigations, which
have either already been conducted or are
planned for the future, typically marked by lexi-
cal clues like examined, investigated and studied,
etc.
Observation: Direct observations, often repre-
sented by lexical clues like found, observed and
report, etc. Simple past tense sentences typically
also describe observations. Such events represent
experimental knowledge.
Analysis: Inferences, interpretations, specula-
tions or other types of cognitive analysis, typi-
cally expressed by lexical clues like suggest, in-
dicate, therefore and conclude etc. Such events,
if they are interpretations or reliable inferences
based on experimental results, can also constitute
another type of (indirect) experimental knowl-
edge. Weaker inferences or speculations, how-
ever, may be considered as hypotheses which
need further proof through experiments.
General: Scientific facts, processes, states or
methodology. This is the default category for the
knowledge type dimension.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99608">
2.2 Certainty Level (CL)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974752893617021">
The value of this dimension is almost always
indicated through the presence/absence of an ex-
plicit lexical marker. In scientific literature, it is
normally only applicable to events whose KT
corresponds either to Analysis or General. In the
case of Analysis events, CL encodes confidence
in the truth of the event, whilst for General
events, there is a temporal aspect, to account for
cases where a particular process is explicitly
stated to occur most (but not all) of the time, us-
ing a marker such as normally, or only occasion-
ally, using a marker like sometimes. Events cor-
responding to direct Observations are not open to
judgements of certainty, nor are Investigation
events, which refer to things which have not yet
happened or have not been verified.
Regarding the choice of values for the CL di-
mension, there is an ongoing discussion as to
whether it is possible to partition the epistemic
scale into discrete categories (Rubin, 2007).
However, the use of a number of distinct catego-
ries is undoubtedly easier for annotation pur-
poses and has been proposed in a number of pre-
vious schemes. Although recent work has sug-
gested the use of four or more categories (Shat-
kay et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2008), our ini-
tial analysis of bio-event corpora has shown that
only three levels of certainty seem readily distin-
guishable for bio-events. This is in line with
Hoye (1997), whose analysis of general English
showed that there are at least three articulated
points on the epistemic scale.
We have chosen to use numerical values for
this dimension, in order to reduce potential anno-
tator confusions or biases that may be introduced
through the use of labels corresponding to par-
ticular lexical markers of each category, such as
probable or possible, and also to account for the
fact that slightly different interpretations apply to
the different levels, according to whether the
event has a KT value of Analysis or General.
L3: No expression of uncertainty or speculation
(default category)
L2: High confidence or slight speculation.
L1: Low confidence or considerable speculation;
typical lexical markers include may, might and
perhaps.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993318">
2.3 Source
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999045">
The source of experimental evidence provides
important information for biologists. This is
demonstrated by its annotation during the crea-
tion of the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al.,
2000) and in the corpus created by Wilbur et al.
(2006). The Source dimension can also help in
distinguishing new experimental knowledge
from previously reported knowledge. Our
scheme distinguishes two categories, namely:
Other: The event is attributed to a previous
study. In this case, explicit clues (citations or
phrases like previous studies etc.) are normally
present.
Current: The event makes an assertion that can
be (explicitly or implicitly) attributed to the cur-
rent study. This is the default category, and is
assigned in the absence of explicit lexical or con-
textual clues.

2.4 Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999785764705882">
This dimension identifies negated events. Al-
though certain bio-event corpora are annotated
with this information, it is still missing from oth-
ers. The indication of whether an event is ne-
gated is vital, as the interpretation of a negated
event instance is completely opposite to the in-
terpretation of a non-negated (positive) instance
of the same event.
We define negation as the absence or non-
existence of an entity or a process. Negation is
typically expressed by the adverbial not and the
nominal no. However, other lexical devices like
negative affixals (un- and in-, etc.), restrictive
verbs (fail, lack, and unable, etc.), restrictive
nouns (exception, etc.), certain adjectives (inde-
pendent, etc.), and certain adverbs (without, etc.)
can also be used.

Events may be accompanied by a word or phrase
which provides an indication of the rate, level,
strength or intensity of the interaction. We refer
to this as the Manner of the event. Information
regarding manner is absent from the majority of
existing bio-event corpora, but yet the presence
of such words can be significant in the correct
interpretation of the event. Our scheme distin-
guishes 3 categories of Manner, namely:
High: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjec-
tives like strongly, rapidly and high, etc.
Low: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjec-
tives like weakly, slightly and slow, etc.
Neutral: Default category assigned to all events

Determining the pragmatic/rhetorical intent be-
hind an event is not completely possible using
any one of our explicitly annotated dimensions.
Although the Knowledge Type value forms the
basis for this, it is not in itself sufficient. How-
ever, a defining feature of our annotation scheme
is that additional information can be inferred by
considering combinations of some of the explic-
itly annotated dimensions. We refer to this addi-
tional information as “latent” or “hyper” dimen-
sions of our scheme. We have identified two
such hyper-dimensions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997909">
3.1 New Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999427217391304">
The isolation of events describing new knowl-
edge can be important in certain tasks undertaken
by biologists, as explained earlier. Events with
the Knowledge Type of Observation could corre-
spond to new knowledge, but only if they repre-
sent observations from the current study, rather
than observations cited from elsewhere. In a
similar way, an Analysis drawn from experimen-
tal results in the current study could be treated as
new knowledge, but generally only if it repre-
sents a straightforward interpretation of results,
rather than something more speculative.
Hence, we consider New Knowledge to be a
hyper-dimension of our scheme. Its value (either
Yes or No) is inferred by considering a combina-
tion of the value assignments for the KT, Source
and CL dimensions.
Table 1 shows the inference table that can be
used to obtain the value for the New Knowledge
hyper-dimension from the assigned values of the
Source, KT and CL dimensions. The symbol „X&apos;
indicates a “don&apos;t care condition”, meaning that
this value does not have any impact on the result.

A further hyper-dimension of our scheme is Hy-
pothesis. The binary value of this hyper-

values of KT and CL. Events with a KT value of
Investigation can always be assumed to be a hy-
pothesis, However, if the KT value is Analysis,
then only those events with a CL value of L1 or
L2 (speculative inferences made on the basis of
results) should be considered as hypothesis, to be
matched with more definite experimental evi-
dence when available. A value of L3 in this in-
stance would normally be classed as new knowl-
edge, as explained in the previous section.
Table 2 shows the inference table that can be

The annotation scheme has been evaluated
through a small annotation experiment. We ran-
domly choose 70 abstracts from the GENIA
Pathway Corpus, which collectively contain over
2600 annotated bio-events. Two of the authors
independently annotated these bio-events using a
set of annotation guidelines. These guidelines
were developed following an analysis of the
various bio-event corpora and the output of the
initial case study (Nawaz et al., 2010).
The highly favourable results of this experi-
ment further confirmed the feasibility and
soundness of the annotation scheme. The re-
mainder of this section discusses the results in
more detail.

We have used the familiar measure of Cohen‟s
kappa (Cohen, 1960) for assessing the quality of
annotation. Table 3 shows the kappa values for
each annotated dimension. The highest value of
kappa was achieved for the Source dimension,
while the KT dimension yielded the lowest kappa
value. Nevertheless, the kappa scores for all an-
notation dimensions were in the good region
(Krippendorff, 1980).

4.2 Category Distribution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830698113208">
Knowledge Type: The most prevalent category
found in this dimension was Observation, with
45% of all annotated events belonging to this
category. Only a small fraction (4%) of these
events was represented by an explicit lexical clue
(mostly sensory verbs). In most cases the tense,
local context (position within the sentence) or
global context (position within the document)
were found to be important factors.
The second most common category (37% of
all annotated events) was General. We discov-
ered that most (64%) of the events belonging to
this category were processes or states embedded
in noun phrases (such as c-fos expression). More
than a fifth of the General events (22%) ex-
pressed known scientific facts, whilst a smaller
fraction (14%) expressed experimental/scientific
methods (such as stimulation and incubation
etc.). Explicit lexical clues were found only for
facts, and even then in only 1% of cases.
Analysis was the third most common category,
comprising 16% of all annotated events. Of the
events belonging to this category, 44% were de-
ductions (CL=L1), whilst the remaining 54%
were hedged interpretations (CL=L2/L3). All
Analysis events were marked with explicit lexical
clues.
The least common category was Investigation
(1.5% of all annotated events). All Investigation
events were marked with explicit lexical clues.
Certainty Level: L3 was found to be the most
prevalent category, corresponding to 93% of all
events. The categories L2 and L1 occurred with
frequencies of 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. The
relative scarcity of speculative sentences in sci-
entific literature is a well documented phenome-
non (Thompson et al., 2008; Vincze et al., 2008).
Vincze et al. (2008) found that less than 18% of
sentences occurring in biomedical abstracts are
speculative. Similarly, we found that around 20%
of corpus events belong to speculative sentences.
Since speculative sentences contain non-
speculative events as well, the frequency of
speculative events is expected to be much less
than the frequency of speculative sentences. In
accordance with this hypothesis, we found that
only 7% of corpus events were expressed with
some degree of speculation. We also found that
almost all speculated events had explicit lexical
clues.
Polarity: Our event-centric view of negation
showed just above 3% of the events to be ne-
gated. Similarly to speculation, the expected fre-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999970965517242">
quency of negated events is lower than the fre-
quency of negated sentences. Another reason for
finding fewer negated events is the fact that, in
contrast to previous schemes, we draw a distinc-
tion between events that are negated and events
expressed with Low manner. For example, cer-
tain words like limited and barely are often con-
sidered as negation clues. However, we consider
them as clues for Low manner. In all cases, nega-
tion was expressed through explicit lexical clues.
Manner: Whilst only a small fraction (4%) of
events contains an indication of Manner, we
found that where present, manner conveys vital
information about the event. Our results also re-
vealed that indications of High manner are three
times more frequent than the indications of Low
manner. We also noted that both High and Low
manners were always indicated through the use
of explicit clues.
Source: Most (99%) of the events were found to
be of the Current category. This is to be ex-
pected, as authors tend to focus on current work
in within abstracts. It is envisaged, however, that
this dimension will be more useful for analyzing
full papers.
Hyper-dimensions: Using the inference tables
shown in section 3, we calculated that almost
57% of the events represent New Knowledge, and
just above 8% represent Hypotheses.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948">
We have evaluated a slightly modified version of
our meta-knowledge annotation scheme for bio-
events, first presented in Nawaz et al. (2010).
The scheme captures key information regarding
the correct interpretation of bio-events, which is
not currently annotated in existing bio-event cor-
pora, but which we have shown to be critical in a
number of text mining tasks undertaken by bi-
ologists. The evaluation results have shown high
inter-annotator agreement and a sufficient num-
ber of annotations along each category in every
dimension. These results have served to confirm
the feasibility and soundness of the annotation
scheme, and provide promising prospects for its
application to existing and new bio-event cor-
pora.
We are currently working on a large scale an-
notation effort, involving multiple independent
annotators. Although our main objective is to
enrich the entire GENIA event corpus with meta-
knowledge information, we also plan to create a
small corpus of full papers enriched with bio-
event and meta-knowledge annotations.

<abstract confidence="0.999642206896552">The correct interpretation of biomedical texts by text mining systems requires the recognition of a range of types of high-level informa- (or about the text. Examples include expressions of negation and speculation, as well as pragmatic/rhetorical intent (e.g. whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, generally accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc.) Although such types of information have previously been annotated at the text-span level (most commonly sentences), annotation at the level of the event is currently quite sparse. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of the multi-dimensional annotation scheme that we have developed specifically for enriching bio-events with meta-knowledge information. Our annotation scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with different types of bio-event annotation, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the metaknowledge expressed in the text. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the field with regards to the diversity of metaknowledge aspects annotated for each event, whilst the evaluation results have confirmed its feasibility and soundness.</abstract>

In scientific texts, it is also important to be able to determine other types of information, such as the author‟s rhetorical/pragmatic intent (de Waard et al., 2009). This would correspond to whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc. The ability to distinguish between these different types of information can be important for tasks such as building and updating models of biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al., 2008), and curation of biological databases (Ashburner et al., 2000). Central to both of these tasks is the identification of new knowledge that can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon an existing, but incomplete model of a biological process (Lisacek et al., 2005) or to ensure that the database is kept up to date. Any new knowledge added should be supported though evidence, which could include linking hypotheses with experimental findings. It is also important to take into account inconsistencies and contradictions reported in the literature.

A bio-event is an event specialised for the biomedical domain. Kim et al. (2008) define a bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation involving one or more participants. These participants can be bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are each assigned a semantic role/slot like theme and cause etc. Each bio-event is typically assigned a type/class from a chosen bio-event taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the GENIA Event Ontology (Kim et al., 2008). Similarly, the bio-entities are also assigned types/classes from a chosen bioterm taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000). As an example, consider the simple sentence shown in Figure 1. The results suggest that the narL gene product activates the nitrate reductase operon. Figure 1. A Simple Sentence from a Biomedical Abstract This sentence contains a single bio-event, anchored to the verb activates. Figure 2 shows a typical structured representation of this bioevent.

L3: No expression of uncertainty or speculation (default category) L2: High confidence or slight speculation. L1: Low confidence or considerable speculation; typical lexical markers include may, might and perhaps. 2.3 Source The source of experimental evidence provides important information for biologists. This is demonstrated by its annotation during the creation of the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) and in the corpus created by Wilbur et al. (2006). The Source dimension can also help in distinguishing new experimental knowledge from previously reported knowledge. Our scheme distinguishes two categories, namely: Other: The event is attributed to a previous study. In this case, explicit clues (citations or phrases like previous studies etc.) are normally present. Current: The event makes an assertion that can be (explicitly or implicitly) attributed to the current study. This is the default category, and is assigned in the absence of explicit lexical or contextual clues. 73 2.4 Polarity Th</context>

However, the use of a number of distinct categories is undoubtedly easier for annotation purposes and has been proposed in a number of previous schemes. Although recent work has suggested the use of four or more categories (Shatkay et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2008), our initial analysis of bio-event corpora has shown that only three levels of certainty seem readily distinguishable for bio-events. This is in line with Hoye (1997), whose analysis of general English showed that there are at least three articulated points on the epistemic scale. We have chosen to use numerical values for this dimension, in order to reduce potential annotator confusions or biases that may be introduced through the use of labels corresponding to particular lexical markers of each category, such as probable or possible, and also to account for the fact that slightly different interpretations apply to the different levels, according to whether the event has a KT value of Analysis or General.

However, what they do not normally do is to annotate lexical clues or keywords used to determine the correct values. A number of previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lexical markers (i.e., words or phrases) that can accompany statements in scientific articles in determining the intended 71 interpretation of the text (e.g. Hyland, 1996; Rizomilioti 2006). We also performed a similar study (Thompson et al., 2008) although, in contrast to other studies, we took a multidimensional approach to the categorisation of such lexical items, acknowledging that several types of important information may be expressed through different words in the same sentence. As an example, let us consider the example sentence in Figure 3. The DNA-binding properties of mutations at positions 849 and 668 may indicate that the catalytic role of these side chains is associated with their interaction with the DNA substrate. Figure 3.

Events are often represented by a template-like structure with slots that are filled by the event participants. Each event participant is also assigned a role within the event. These participants can be entities, concepts or even other events. This kind of event representation allows the information contained in a text to be represented as a collection of nested events. A bio-event is an event specialised for the biomedical domain. Kim et al. (2008) define a bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation involving one or more participants. These participants can be bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are each assigned a semantic role/slot like theme and cause etc. Each bio-event is typically assigned a type/class from a chosen bio-event taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the GENIA Event Ontology (Kim et al., 2008). Similarly, the bio-entities are also assigned types/classes from a chosen bioterm taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000). As an example, consider the simple sentence shown in Figure 1. The results suggest that the </context>

Such queries can specify semantic restrictions on the events in terms of event types, semantic role labels and named entity types etc. (Miyao et al., 2006), in addition to particular keywords. For example, it would be possible to search only for those texts containing bio-events of type negative_regulation where the cause is an entity of type protein. Such queries provide a great deal more descriptive power than traditional keyword searches over unstructured documents. Biomedical corpora that have been manually annotated with event level information (e.g., Pyysalo et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009) facilitate the training of systems such as those described above. Whilst event-based querying has advantages for efficient searching, the extracted events have little practical use if they are not accompanied by meta-knowledge information to aid in their interpretation. 1.2 Existing Meta-knowledge Annotation Various corpora of biomedical literature (abstracts and/or full papers) have been produced that feature some degree of meta-knowledge annotation. These corpora vary in both the richness of the annotation added, and the type/size of the units at which the meta-knowl</context>

The scheme consists of multiple annotation dimensions which capture aspects of both certainty and rhetorical/pragmatic intent, amongst other things. Training a system to automatically annotate these dimensions is shown to be highly feasible (Shatkay et al., 2008). Event-Level Annotation: Explicit annotation of meta-knowledge at the event-level is currently rather minimal within biomedical corpora. Whilst several corpora contain annotations to distinguish positive and negative events (e.g. Sanchez-Graillet &amp; Poesio, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007), the annotation of the GENIA Event Corpus (Kim et al., 2008) is slightly more extensive, in that it additionally annotates certainty level. To our knowledge, no existing bio-event corpus has attempted annotation that concerns rhetorical/pragmatic intent. 1.3 The Need for an Event-Centric MetaKnowledge Annotation Scheme In comparison to meta-knowledge annotation carried out at the text-span level, the amount of annotation carried out at the event level is quite sparse. The question thus arises as to whether it is possible to use systems trained on text-span annotated corpora to assign meta-knowledge to bio-events, or whether new annotation at the event </context>

Only a small fraction (4%) of these events was represented by an explicit lexical clue (mostly sensory verbs). In most cases the tense, local context (position within the sentence) or global context (position within the document) were found to be important factors.

This would correspond to whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc. The ability to distinguish between these different types of information can be important for tasks such as building and updating models of biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al., 2008), and curation of biological databases (Ashburner et al., 2000). Central to both of these tasks is the identification of new knowledge that can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon an existing, but incomplete model of a biological process (Lisacek et al., 2005) or to ensure that the database is kept up to date. Any new knowledge added should be supported though evidence, which could include linking hypotheses with experimental findings. It is also important to take into account inconsistencies and contradictions reported in the literature.

Whilst our previous work served to demonstrate that the different aspects of metaknowledge that can be specified lexically within texts require a multi-dimensional analysis to correctly capture their subtleties, it showed that the presence of particular lexical items is not the only important feature for determining metaknowledge categories. In particular, their presence does not guarantee that the “expected” interpretation can be assumed (Sándor, 2007). In addition, not all types of meta-knowledge are indicated through explicit markers. Mizuta &amp; Collier (2004) note that rhetorical zones may be indicated not only through explicit lexical markers, but also through features such as the main verb in the clause and the position of the sentence within the article or abstract. For these reasons, we perform annotation on all relevant instances, regardless of the presence of lexical markers. This will allow systems to be trained that can learn to determine the correct meta-knowledge category, even when lexical markers are not present.

It is also important to take into account inconsistencies and contradictions reported in the literature. The production of annotated corpora can help to train text mining systems to recognise types of meta-knowledge, such as the above. Although a number of such corpora have already been produced, different annotation schemes are required according to the exact domain under consideration, as well as the types of task that will be undertaken by the text mining system. The work described in this paper is focused on the design and evaluation of the meta-knowledge annotation scheme described in Nawaz et al., (2010). The annotation scheme has been specifically designed to recognise a range of metaknowledge types for events extracted from biomedical texts (henceforth bio-events). The aim is to facilitate the development of more useful systems in the context of various biomedical information extraction (IE) and textual inference (TI) tasks. Although the scheme has been designed 69 Proceedings of the Workshop on Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing, pages 69–77, Uppsala, July 2010. for application to existing bio-event corpora, it is intended to be applied to any type of bio-relation corp</context>

This will allow systems to be trained that can learn to determine the correct meta-knowledge category, even when lexical markers are not present. However, due to the proven importance of lexical markers in determining certain meta-knowledge dimensions, our annotation scheme annotates such markers, whenever they are present. 2 Annotation Scheme The annotation scheme we present here is a slightly modified version of our original metaknowledge annotation scheme (Nawaz et al., 2010). The modified scheme consists of five meta-knowledge dimensions, each with a set of complete and mutually-exclusive categories, i.e., any given bio-event belongs to exactly one category in each dimension. Our chosen set of annotation dimensions has been motivated by the major information needs of biologists discussed earlier, i.e., the ability to distinguish between different intended interpretations of events. In order to minimise the annotation burden, the number of possible categories within each dimension has been kept as small as possible, whilst still respecting important distinctions i</context>

Inference-Table for Hypothesis Hyper-Dimension 4 Evaluation The annotation scheme has been evaluated through a small annotation experiment. We randomly choose 70 abstracts from the GENIA Pathway Corpus, which collectively contain over 2600 annotated bio-events. Two of the authors independently annotated these bio-events using a set of annotation guidelines. These guidelines were developed following an analysis of the various bio-event corpora and the output of the initial case study (Nawaz et al., 2010). The highly favourable results of this experiment further confirmed the feasibility and soundness of the annotation scheme. The remainder of this section discusses the results in more detail.

Source: Most (99%) of the events were found to be of the Current category. This is to be expected, as authors tend to focus on current work in within abstracts. It is envisaged, however, that this dimension will be more useful for analyzing full papers. Hyper-dimensions: Using the inference tables shown in section 3, we calculated that almost 57% of the events represent New Knowledge, and just above 8% represent Hypotheses. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We have evaluated a slightly modified version of our meta-knowledge annotation scheme for bioevents, first presented in Nawaz et al. (2010). The scheme captures key information regarding the correct interpretation of bio-events, which is not currently annotated in existing bio-event corpora, but which we have shown to be critical in a number of text mining tasks undertaken by biologists. The evaluation results have shown high inter-annotator agreement and a sufficient number of annotations along each category in every dimension. These results have served to confirm the feasibility and soundness of the annotation scheme, and provide promising prospects for its application to existing and new bio-event corpora.

This would correspond to whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc. The ability to distinguish between these different types of information can be important for tasks such as building and updating models of biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al., 2008), and curation of biological databases (Ashburner et al., 2000). Central to both of these tasks is the identification of new knowledge that can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon an existing, but incomplete model of a biological process (Lisacek et al., 2005) or to ensure that the database is kept up to date. Any new knowledge added should be supported though evidence, which could include linking hypotheses with experimental findings. It is also important to take into account inconsistencies and contradictions reported in the literature. The production of annotated corpora can help to</context>

Such queries provide a great deal more descriptive power than traditional keyword searches over unstructured documents.

However, what they do not normally do is to annotate lexical clues or keywords used to determine the correct values. A number of previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lexical markers (i.e., words or phrases) that can accompany statements in scientific articles in determining the intended 71 interpretation of the text (e.g. Hyland, 1996; Rizomilioti 2006). We also performed a similar study (Thompson et al., 2008) although, in contrast to other studies, we took a multidimensional approach to the categorisation of such lexical items, acknowledging that several types of important information may be expressed through different words in the same sentence. As an example, let us consider the example sentence in Figure 3. The DNA-binding properties of mutations at positions 849 and 668 may indicate that the catalytic role of these side chains is associated with their interaction with the DNA substrate. Figure 3.

Whilst our previous work served to demonstrate that the different aspects of metaknowledge that can be specified lexically within texts require a multi-dimensional analysis to correctly capture their subtleties, it showed that the presence of particular lexical items is not the only important feature for determining metaknowledge categories. In particular, their presence does not guarantee that the “expected” interpretation can be assumed (Sándor, 2007). In addition, not all types of meta-knowledge are indicated through explicit markers. Mizuta &amp; Collier (2004) note that rhetorical zones may be indicated not only through explicit lexical markers, but also through features such as the main verb in the clause and the position of the sentence within the article or abstract. For these reasons, we perform annotation on all relevant instances, regardless of the presence of lexical markers. This will allow systems to be trained that can learn to determine the correct meta-knowledge category, even when lexical markers are not present. However, due t</context>

The relative scarcity of speculative sentences in scientific literature is a well documented phenomenon (Thompson et al., 2008; Vincze et al., 2008). Vincze et al. (2008) found that less than 18% of sentences occurring in biomedical abstracts are speculative. Similarly, we found that around 20% of corpus events belong to speculative sentences. Since speculative sentences contain nonspeculative events as well, the frequency of speculative events is expected to be much less than the frequency of speculative sentences. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that only 7% of corpus events were expressed with some degree of speculation. We also found that almost all speculated events had explicit lexical clues.

The situation becomes more complicated if a sentence contains an expression of speculation. If this is only marked at the sentence level, there may be confusion about which part(s) of the sentence are affected by the speculative expression. Certain corpora and associated systems have attempted to address these issues. The BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) annotates the scopes of negative and speculative keywords, whilst Morante &amp; Daelemans (2009) have trained a system to undertake this task. The scheme described by Wilbur et al. (2006) applies annotation to fragments of sentences, which are created on the basis of changes in the meta-knowledge expressed. The scheme consists of multiple annotation dimensions which capture aspects of both certainty and rhetorical/pragmatic intent, amongst other things. Training a system to automatically annotate these dimensions is shown to be highly feasible (Shatkay et al., 2008). Event-Level Annotation: Explicit annotation of meta-knowledge at the event-level is currently rather minimal within biomedical corpora. Whilst several corpora contain annotations to distinguish positive and negati</context>
<context position="11450" citStr="Wilbur et al. (2006)" startWordPosition="1769" endWordPosition="1772"> MetaKnowledge Annotation Scheme In comparison to meta-knowledge annotation carried out at the text-span level, the amount of annotation carried out at the event level is quite sparse. The question thus arises as to whether it is possible to use systems trained on text-span annotated corpora to assign meta-knowledge to bio-events, or whether new annotation at the event level is required. Some corpora seem better suited to this purpose than others – whilst sentence-level annotations are certainly too granular for an eventcentric view of the text, sentence fragments, such as those identified by Wilbur et al. (2006), are likely to correspond more closely to the extent of text that describes an event and its slots. Likewise, knowing the scopes of negative and speculative keywords within a sentence may be a useful aid in determining whether they affect the interpretation of a particular event. However, the information provided in these corpora is still not sufficiently precise for eventlevel meta-knowledge annotation. Even within a text fragment, there may be several different bioevents, each with slightly different metaknowledge interpretations. In a similar way, not all events that occur within the scope</context>

L3: No expression of uncertainty or speculation (default category) L2: High confidence or slight speculation. L1: Low confidence or considerable speculation; typical lexical markers include may, might and perhaps. 2.3 Source The source of experimental evidence provides important information for biologists. This is demonstrated by its annotation during the creation of the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) and in the corpus created by Wilbur et al. (2006). The Source dimension can also help in distinguishing new experimental knowledge from previously reported knowledge. Our scheme distinguishes two categories, namely: Other: The event is attributed to a previous study. In this case, explicit clues (citations or phrases like previous studies etc.) are normally present. Current: The event makes an assertion that can be (explicitly or implicitly) attributed to the current study. This is the default category, and is assigned in the absence of explicit lexical or contextual clues. 73 2.4 Polarity This dimension identifies negated events. Although c</context>
