Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99949647826087">
In this paper we compare programs of work
that aim to develop broad coverage cross-
linguistic resources for NLP: Ontological
Semantics (OntoSem) and SIMPLE. The
approaches taken in these projects differ in
three notable respects: the use of an
ontology versus a word net as the semantic
substrate; the development of knowledge
resources inside of as opposed to outside of
a processing environment; and the
development of lexicons for multiple
languages based on a single core lexicon or
without such a core (i.e., in parallel
fashion). In large part, these differences
derive from project-driven, real-world
requirements and available resources – a
reflection of their being practical rather
than theoretical projects. However, that
being said, we will suggest certain
preferences regarding the content and
development of NLP resources with a view
toward both short- and long-term, high-
level language processing goals.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999772322580645">
Ontological Semantics (OntoSem) is a multi-
lingual text processing environment that takes as
input unrestricted text and, using a suite of static
resources and processors, automatically creates
text-meaning representations (TMRs) which can
then be used as the basis for any NLP application,
including MT, question answering, summarization,
etc. OntoSem knowledge resources are developed
in coordination with each other and with the
processors they serve. Some of the resources are
fully language independent while others are readily
parameterizable, wherein lies the cross-linguistic
portability of the system. Although in this paper,
we focus on OntoSem lexicons, a crucial point is
that they are not built in isolation but, rather, in an
integrated environment where their utility can be
tested and evaluated in a variety of practical
applications.
The SIMPLE project takes a different approach
to achieving the dual goals of multilinguality and
resource utility across applications. It aims to
develop compatible (they use the term
“harmonised”) lexicons for 12 European
languages, attempting to foresee what will be most
useful for applications but without referring to any
particular processors that will use the information
and without building any other knowledge
resources to share the burden of semantic
specification. As we will show, these different
points of departure lead to quite different
realizations of cross-lingual lexicons for NLP.

2 Overview of SIMPLE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999600738095238">
The SIMPLE project is developing 10K-sense
“harmonised” semantic lexicons for 12 European
Union languages (Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian,
Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish), continuing the
earlier PAROLE project, which developed 20K-
sense morphological and syntactic lexicons for
these languages. The lexicons are monolingual and
are developed independently, with the word stock
based on corpus evidence for each language. To
ensure some overlap of lexical senses, certain Base
Concepts of EuroWordNet must be covered in
each language (462 nominal, 187 verbal and 185
adjectival Base Concepts that were culled and
cleaned from EuroWordNet). This overlap will
permit direct interlinking among languages;
interlinking of the rest of the lexical stock is slated
as future work. Pustejovsky’s four Qualia (which
are, essentially, properties expressing formal,
agentive, constitutive and telic meanings; see
Pustejovsky 1995) are used to specify certain
aspects of word meaning, and a common library of
140 template types is used to guide acquisition in
all languages (Lenci et al 2000a, 2000b).
Lenci et al. 2000b (p. 5) summarize the
information that can be represented in a SIMPLE
lexicon entry: “i) semantic type, corresponding to
the template the SemU (semantic unit) instantiates;
ii) domain information; iii) lexicographic gloss; iv)
argument structure for predicative SemUs; v)
selectional restrictions on the arguments; vi) event
type, to characterise the aspectual properties of
verbal predicates; vii) link of the arguments to the
syntactic subcategorization frames, as represented
in the PAROLE lexicons; viii) Qualia Structure;
ix) information about regular polysemous
alternation in which a word sense may enter; x)
cross-part-of-speech relations (e.g. intelligent -
intelligence; writer - to write); xi) synonymy.”

Palmer et al. 2000).

While the SIMPLE project is certainly
producing useful resources, we would suggest that
the lexical information and structure are being
overly constrained by the frameworks selected,
which we will comment on briefly in preparation
for an extended comparison between OntoSem and
SIMPLE in section 4.
EuroWordNet is being used as the anchor for
semantic description in SIMPLE. However, like
the original English WordNet, it is not a property-
rich ontology but, rather, a hierarchical net of
lexical items whose use in NLP has the same
pitfalls as any non-ontological word net (e.g., lack
of disambiguating power and lack of sufficient
relations between entities; see Nirenburg 2004c for
a discussion of the insufficiency of WordNet for
NLP). In order to make up for the sparsity of
information in the semantic substrate, the SIMPLE
lexicons contain what would, we believe, be more
efficiently recorded in a single, sufficient ontology.
For example, when the lexicon acquirers for each
language use the Instrument template to describe
lancet, they must rerecord in the lexicon of each L
all of the language-independent property values for
this lexical item, like the values for the four Qualia
(formal, agentive, constitutive, telic), the domain,
the unification path, etc. This is significant
redundancy and, moreover, there is no guarantee
that acquirers will arrive at the same decisions,
either through error, oversight or competing
analyses of the phenomena in question.
Another, in our view, insufficiently explained
aspect of SIMPLE is the priority given to Qualia as
descriptors of lexical items. The original inventory
of Qualia (from Pustejovsky 1995) consists of only
four properties of the hundreds that can usefully be
used to link concepts for purposes of NLP. Lenci et
al. (2000b) address this issue as follows:
“Although they [the four Qualia] clearly do not
exhaust the semantic content of lexical items,
Pustejovsky (1995) has convincingly shown that
these four Qualia dimensions play a particularly
prominent role in determining the linguistic
behavior of word senses, as well as in the
explanation of the generative mechanisms at the
basis of lexical creativity. Qualia-based
information can be specified for all the parts of
speech, although prima facie it seems to be more
directly suitable for the characterization of certain
types of nominals”. However, there is large gap
between theoretical interest and practical
application: in fact, because of this, the SIMPLE
project has moved toward an Extended Qualia
Structure with more fine-grained subtypes of given
Qualia.1
In conclusion, we believe that SIMPLE is
pursuing useful goals that could be pursued in even
more useful ways by shifting the focus from
lexicon-only work to integrated work within an
environment in which ontological and lexical
resources are developed together and where extant
types of processors can be used to test the value of
resources as they are developed.

<bodyText confidence="0.932884605263158">
The OntoSem approach to lexicon and ontology
acquisition differs from that used in SIMPLE
1 As an aside, we see a parallel between focusing on
Qualia in lexical description and, for example, focusing
on classes of verbs with respect to their alternations, as
is done, for example, in Levin 1995. While the
descriptions that derive from theoretically-driven
research such as this can certainly be useful, when it
comes to writing “well-rounded” semantic descriptions
of words for large-scale systems, there is no distinction
between a Quale and other properties. Similarly, the fact
that a verb belongs to some group with respect to
alternations is no more or less important than its other
potential group membership along other parameters. See
Nirenburg and Raskin 2004 for further discussion of
these and related issues.
because OntoSem is an integrated text processing
environment, meaning that knowledge resources
are crafted hand-in-hand with each other and with
processors such that responsibility for various
analysis tasks can be distributed in an ideal (to the
degree of our understanding) way.
OntoSem takes as input unrestricted raw text
and carries out preprocessing, morphological
analysis, syntactic analysis and semantic analysis,
with the results of semantic analysis represented as
formal text-meaning representations (TMRs) that
can then be used as the basis for a wide variety of
NLP applications. Text analysis relies on:
• The OntoSem language-independent ontology,
which is written using a metalanguage of
description and currently contains around 5,500
concepts, each of which is described by an
average of 16 properties. In all, the ontology
contains hundreds of properties (which cover the
same territory as the Qualia plus much more).
Fillers for properties can be other ontological
concepts or literals.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.772414294117647">
• An OntoSem lexicon for each language
processed, which contains syntactic and semantic
zones (linked using variables) as well as calls to
“meaning procedures” (i.e., programs that carry
out procedural semantics, see McShane et al.
2004a) when applicable. The semantic zone most
frequently refers to ontological concepts, either
directly or with property-based modifications,
but can also describe word meaning extra-
ontologically, for example, in terms of modality,
aspect, time, etc. The current English lexicon
contains approximately 12K senses, including all
closed-class items and the most frequent verbs,
as indicated by corpus analysis. This English
lexicon took less than 1 person year to build and
can (as described below) be ported to other
languages.
• An onomasticon, or lexicon of proper names,
which contains approximately 350,000 entries
and is growing daily using semi-automated
extraction techniques.
• A fact repository, which contains real-world
facts represented as numbered “remembered
instances” of ontological concepts (e.g., SPEECH-
ACT-3366 is the 3366th instantiation of the
concept SPEECH-ACT in the world model
constructed during the given run of the analyzer).
• The OntoSem text analyzers, which cover
preprocessing, syntactic analysis, semantic
analysis, and creation of TMRs. They are largely
parameterizable and thus can be ported to other
languages.
• The TMR language, which is the metalanguage
for representing text meaning. A very simple

sentences we process are much longer), which

Details of this approach to text processing can be
found, e.g., in Nirenburg et al. 2004a,b. The
ontology itself, a brief ontology tutorial, and an
extensive lexicon tutorial can be viewed at
http://ilit.umbc.edu.
OntoSem has been used with languages
including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and
Persian, to varying degrees of lexical coverage
(e.g., earlier, less fine-grained English and Spanish
lexicons contained 40K entries and were used for
MT in the Mikrokosmos project). What makes
OntoSem amenable to efficient cross-linguistic
usage is that many of the resources are either fully
language independent (the ontology, the fact
repository, the TMR metalanguage) or
parameterizable in well understood ways. Here we
focus on exploiting cross-linguistic similarity for
lexical acquisition, but a similar analysis could be
applied to the OntoSem analyzers.

A basic verbal lexicon entry in OntoSem looks as
follows (in presentation format):

<bodyText confidence="0.988161642857143">
The syntactic structure (syn-struc) says that this is
a transitive sense of watch and the semantic
structure (sem-struc) says that a VOLUNTARY-
VISUAL-EVENT – which is a concept in our
ontology – must be instantiated in the TMR. The
variables are used for linking, so, for example, the
syntactic subject is linked to the meaning of the
AGENT of the VOLUNTARY-VISUAL-EVENT (^ is
read ‘the meaning of’).
Apart from mapping directly to an ontological
concept, there are many other – and more complex
– ways to express meaning in OntoSem. For
example, one can map to an ontological concept
with modified property values: e.g.,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9940375">
• Zionist is described as a POLITICAL-ROLE that
is the AGENT-OF a SUPPORT event whose THEME

• asphalt (v.) is described as a COVER event

• recall (v. as in they recalled the high chairs) is
described as a RETURN-OBJECT event that is
CAUSED-BY a FOR-PROFIT-CORPORATION and
whose THEME is ARTIFACT, INGESTIBLE or
MATERIAL.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982566304347826">
There are also a number of fully or partially
non-ontological ways of describing meaning, like
the use of parametric values of mood or aspect. For
example, the auxiliary might as in He might come
over is described using the modality ‘epistemic’,
which deals with the truth value of a statement:
syn-struc
subject $var1 cat n
v $var0 cat v
inf-cl $var2 cat v
sem-struc
^$var2
epistemic .5
agent ^$var1

fix-case-role (value ^$var1) (value ^$var2) 2

listed AGENT case-role is inappropriate considering the
meaning of $var1 and/or $var2: e.g., in the truck might
come, truck is a THEME of a MOTION-EVENT, not an

As already shown in the examples of might and
yesterday, calls to procedural semantic routines
(which may or may not be listed in the meaning-
procedure zone of the lexicon entry) are used
widely in OntoSem lexical description. This
reflects the fact that many aspects of meaning
cannot be statically described but, rather, must be
computed. An advantage of developing lexical
resources within a processing environment is being
able to assign responsibility for portions of
semantic composition to resources best suited for
them.
In addition to the means of lexical expression
described above, OntoSem lexicon entries can
include entities of any degree of complexity,
including phrasals of any profile, as reported in
McShane et al. 2004b.

3.2 Porting OntoSem Lexicon Entries Across
Languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992522043956044">
As is clear from the examples above, OntoSem
provides significant expressive power semantically
(not to mention syntactically, which we do not
pursue here). Expressive means include mapping
to the ontology (which itself is rich in property-
value descriptors), mapping to the ontology with
lexical supplementation of properties, or referring
to extra-ontological microtheories like those that
treat time, reference resolution, comparison,
ellipsis resolution, modality, aspect, etc. What
must be emphasized, however, is how language
neutral – and therefore portable across languages –
the semantic descriptions are. Whereas it is typical
to assume that lexicons are language-specific
whereas ontologies are language-independent,
most aspects of OntoSem sem-strucs are language-
independent, apart from the linking of specific
variables to their counterparts in the syn-struc.
AGENT, and in I might get sick, I am an EXPERIENCER of
a DISEASE event, not an AGENT of it.
Stated differently, if we consider sem-strucs – no
matter what lexicon they originate from – to be
building blocks of the representation of word
meaning (as opposed to concept meaning, as is
done in the ontology), then the job of writing a
lexicon for L2 based on the lexicon for L1 is in
large part limited to a) providing an L2 translation
for the head word(s), b) making any necessary syn-
struc adjustments and c) checking/modifying the
linking among variables in the syn- and sem-strucs.
This conception of cross-linguistic lexicon
development derives in large part from the
Principle of Practical Effability (Nirenburg and
Raskin 2004), which states that what can be
expressed in one language can somehow be
expressed in all other languages, be it by a word, a
phrase, etc.
Apart from this theoretical justification for
conceptualizing the sem-strucs as building blocks
for lexical representation, there are two practical
rationales: supporting consistency of meaning
representation across languages and using acquirer
time most efficiently in large-scale lexical
acquisition.
As regards consistency, the potential for
paraphrase must be considered when building
multi-lingual resources. For instance, ‘weapons of
mass destruction’ can be described as the union of
CHEMICAL-WEAPON and BIOLOGICAL-WEAPON, or
it can be described as WEAPON with the ability to
KILL &gt; 10,000 HUMANs (the actual number
recorded will be treated by the analyzer in a fuzzy
fashion; however, it would be less than ideal for a
lexicon for L2 to record 10,000 while a lexicon for
L3 recorded 25,000). While both representations
are valid, it is desirable to use the same one in all
languages covered. In addition, the decision of
how to describe a notion – whether by ontologizing
it, describing it using extra-ontological means,
describing it using an existing concept with
additional properties and values defined – is often
a judgment call. It would not be desirable for the
acquirer of German to map the word Schimmel
‘white horse’ to the concept HORSE with the lexical
restriction COLOR: WHITE, while the acquirer of
some other language that also has a word for
‘white horse’ introduced an ontological concept
specifically for this entity. Again, while both
representations are valid and, in this case,
semantically equivalent, the general tendency
should be to strive toward uniformity where
possible.
As concerns acquirer time, composing sem-
strucs is, by far, the most time- and effort-intensive
aspect of writing OntoSem lexicon entries. This
derives from the wealth of expressive means; the
fact that microtheories of time, reference, etc., are
naturally built during lexicon development (recall
that our environment is fully integrated with
processors); and the fact that ontology
development occurs hand-in-hand with lexicon
development. Therefore, work on the first lexicon
entry that describes a word sense – regardless of
the language of origin – takes much more time
than editing a word sense for a new language.
Moreover, although in the worst case some editing
of entries is necessary for L2, L3, etc., in most
cases no such editing is needed. Although one
might hypothesize this state of affairs based on
cross-linguistic principles, we have tested it in the
lexicon-porting experiment described below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9851925">
3.3 An English to Polish Lexicon Porting
Experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891274193549">
For the experiment, a bilingual English/Polish
computational linguist took the English OntoSem
lexicon as a seed and experimented with various
porting methods into Polish.
The primary insight was that while manually
porting individual lexical senses is quite
straightforward and will save time over acquisition
from scratch, porting lexicons wholesale is rather
more complex. That is, manually providing
translations for the senses in L1 is a conceptually
relatively simple task, complicated only by the
need for the occasional remapping of variables,
editing of syntactic structures, omission of given
senses due to language lacunae (e.g., a phrasal
encoded in L1 might not occur in L2 in a fixed
form), etc. However, if one attempts either to
(semi-)automate the acquisition process and/or use
L1 as a seed lexicon for more “creative”
acquisition of L2, the space of options becomes
quite broad and must be constrained
programmatically in order to actually benefit from
the reuse of semantic descriptions.
For example, if a well-trained acquirer of L2 is
using L1 as a seed, questions that arise include:
Should the base lexicon be left as is (considering
that it is known to have incomplete coverage) or
should one attempt to improve its quality and
coverage while building L2? Should L2 acquisition
be driven by correspondences in head words or
simply by the content of sem-struc zones (e.g., all
English senses of table will be in one head entry,
and typically will be acquired at once; should all
senses of all L2 translations of table be handled at
once during L2 acquisition or should the L2
acquirer wait until he comes upon sem-strucs that
represent the given other meanings of the L2
words)? To what extent should the regular
acquisition process – including ontology
supplementation – be carried out on L2? The
answers to all of these, and more such, questions
depend entirely upon available resources and
should be informed by (a) experiments to
determine what works best for a given acquirer,
and (b) the goals of a given project.
As regards automation, the experiment found
that automatically mapping L2 words to L1
OntoSem entries works very well (at well over
90%) when the machine-tractable L1-L2 resource
used to support this process has one sense of the
given word in the given part of speech and the
OntoSem lexicon also has one sense for the given
part of speech. The extraction and matching of
such senses represents a well-defined, extremely
time-efficient task, especially for specialized
terminology that tends to have only one sense in
any language. When the mapping between senses
in the L1-L2 lexicon and the OntoSem lexicon is
more than one to one, manual linking of senses
(which do not always correspond among the
languages) has proved necessary, with the potential
benefits of a time-saving interface becoming
immediately clear.3

Now we return to the comparison between
SIMPLE and OntoSem. We use the example of
pudding, which is cited in numerous documents
related to SIMPLE. The Qualia (in italics) and
their values (in boldface) for this word are: formal
– substance; constitutive – ingredients; telic –
eat; agentive – make. The stated rationale for
encoding these qualia values in SIMPLE lexicon
entries is that they are needed to understand the
semantics of the sentences like the following (from
Lenci et al. 2000b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955342142857143">

not the best place for this information and, further,

information for processing all the above sentences
containing pudding. Moreover, since the OntoSem
ontology, lexicons and processors are developed
together, their known mutual contributions drive
resource acquisition. Obviously, one cannot expect
the same approaches to be used in a lexicon-only
project like SIMPLE. However, a non-trivial
question, considering the expense of manual
resource acquisition, is to what extent should we
be developing resources separately from
processors that can use them, especially when the
nature of processors crucially affects what is
needed of knowledge resources?

carried out as follows. For (a), there is a lexical
sense of refuse that expects an OBJECT (not an
EVENT, as in the main sense) as its direct object.
This sense expects the semantic ellipsis of a verb
and, as such, is supplemented with a meaning
procedure called ‘seek-specification’, which
searches for the elided event. There are two
sources it searches: previous TMRs, for a recent
semantically viable event, and the ontology itself,
for an EVENT (or EVENTs) whose default AGENT is
HUMAN and default THEME is PUDDING. This
search procedure in some cases returns more than
one candidate event to reconstruct the semantic
ellipsis. While this is not always ideal, it does
reflect precisely the type of lexical ambiguity that
can be resolved only by contextual clues. For
example, the sentence John refused the pudding
could be used in a supermarket context to describe
a situation where John refused to take/accept a free
box of pudding that was being pushed upon him by
a promoter. The desire to be able to treat this
second reading of the sentence is the reason for
treating constraints in OntoSem abductively. As far
as one can tell, the constraints in SIMPLE are
rigid: “telic = eat” for pudding is a hard constraint.
In fact, the example John refused the pudding is
representative of a much broader class of
phenomena known as semantic ellipsis, the
treatment of which must be carried out by
procedural semantic routines (see McShane et al.
2004a for details).
Example (b) is another case that OntoSem
handles through lexical and procedural semantics
working in tandem. The NP easy pudding is
actually a construction {a value on the scale
DIFFICULTY + ARTIFACT} that is known to involve
semantic ellipsis. Thus, we prepare for it in the
OntoSem lexicon by associating this construction
with the seek-specification meaning procedure,
described above, which handles with equal
efficacy easy pudding (PREPARE-FOOD), easy song
(PERFORM-MUSIC), etc.
Example (c) is handled trivially based on the
fact that PUDDING is a PHYSICAL-OBJECT and, like
all PHYSICAL-OBJECTs, is ontologically defined for
LOCATION.
Example (d) is analyzed using the information
that PUDDING is a PREPARED-FOOD and, as such, is
the THEME-OF PREPARE-FOOD, which in turn is a
child of CREATE-ARTIFACT. The lexicalized phrasal
{ARTIFACT + come out + a value of evaluative
modality} is mapped to CREATE-ARTIFACT, with
the THEME being the given ARTIFACT and the
evaluative modality being concretized based on the
evaluative value of the lexical item (e.g., ‘well’, as
in ‘the pudding came out well’ is mapped to
‘evaluative .7’). This phrasal, of course, works for
any ARTIFACT and any value of evaluative
modality, so lexicalizing it once is a real savings in
time and effort.
Example (e) has two possible treatments in
OntoSem: on the one hand, the lexical item ‘bread
pudding’ could (and, ultimately, should – though it
is not in the OntoSem lexicon at the moment) be
listed as a phrasal in the lexicon, described as
PUDDING: HAS-OBJECT-AS-PART BREAD. However,
if it is not listed, it is treated by our productive
rules for treating noun-noun compounds. One of
the N-N compound rules is that the pattern
MATERIAL + N is analyzed as N:HAS-OBJECT-AS-
PART:MATERIAL.

Although space does not permit us to fully describe
the resources, programs and resulting TMRs for
sentences (a)-(e), this snapshot of their processing
underscores the point that developing resources
within an environment where they are tightly
coupled with processing has clear advantages over
developing resources in the abstract. Of course, in
the absence of a full environment, projects like
SIMPLE make sense. However, the challenges of
resource development outside of an environment
are keenly felt by developers: as Calzolari
(1999:42) reports: “A dichotomy at stake here is
the one between generality of a LR [lexical
resource] vs. usefulness for applications. In
principle, only when we know the actual specific
use we intend to do [sic] of a LR can we build the
‘very best’ LR for that use, but this has proved to
be too expensive and not realistic. In practice,
however, there exists a large core of information
that can be shared by many applicative uses, and
this leads to the concept of “generic” LR, which is
at the basis for the EAGLES initiative and of the
PAROLE/SIMPLE projects, to be then enhanced
and tuned with other means”. The only aspect of
this statement that we would dispute is the
unrealistic nature of building resources for
particular systems. If a system, like OntoSem,
creates text-meaning representations that can be
used equally effectively for many applications,
then there is no reason why they cannot be built
specifically for the given environment. In other
words, when the result of semantic analysis is a
metalanguage-formulated TMR, programs of any
profile can exploit this representation. Stated
differently, there need not be a direct link between
end applications and the input text elements or
their lexical representations.

<abstract confidence="0.999257708333333">In this paper we compare programs of work that aim to develop broad coverage crosslinguistic resources for NLP: Ontological Semantics (OntoSem) and SIMPLE. The approaches taken in these projects differ in three notable respects: the use of an ontology versus a word net as the semantic substrate; the development of knowledge resources inside of as opposed to outside of a processing environment; and the development of lexicons for multiple languages based on a single core lexicon or without such a core (i.e., in parallel fashion). In large part, these differences derive from project-driven, real-world requirements and available resources – a reflection of their being practical rather than theoretical projects. However, that being said, we will suggest certain preferences regarding the content and development of NLP resources with a view toward both shortand long-term, highlevel language processing goals.</abstract>

While the descriptions that derive from theoretically-driven research such as this can certainly be useful, when it comes to writing “well-rounded” semantic descriptions of words for large-scale systems, there is no distinction between a Quale and other properties. Similarly, the fact that a verb belongs to some group with respect to alternations is no more or less important than its other potential group membership along other parameters.

The ontology itself, a brief ontology tutorial, and an extensive lexicon tutorial can be viewed at http://ilit.umbc.edu. OntoSem has been used with languages including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Persian, to varying degrees of lexical coverage (e.g., earlier, less fine-grained English and Spanish lexicons contained 40K entries and were used for MT in the Mikrokosmos project). What makes OntoSem amenable to efficient cross-linguistic usage is that many of the resources are either fully language independent (the ontology, the fact repository, the TMR metalanguage) or parameterizab</context>

For comparison, we present our approach to describing and processing pudding in the OntoSem environment. Since OntoSem uses a full ontology (not a word net), the ontological specification of the concept PUDDING contains much of the needed 3 Some automation of the mapping between L1-L2 multi-sense words is possible as demonstrated by Pianta, et al. 2002, but the results still require intensive manual work by an acquirer. information for processing all the above sentences containing pudding. Moreover, since the OntoSem ontology, lexicons and processors are developed together, their known mutual contributions drive resource acquisition. Obviously, one cannot expect the same approaches to be used in a lexicon-only project like SIMPLE. However, a non-trivial question, considering the expense of manual resource acquisition, is to what extent should we be developing resources separately from processors that can use them, especially when the nature</context>

To ensure some overlap of lexical senses, certain Base Concepts of EuroWordNet must be covered in each language (462 nominal, 187 verbal and 185 adjectival Base Concepts that were culled and cleaned from EuroWordNet). This overlap will permit direct interlinking among languages; interlinking of the rest of the lexical stock is slated as future work. Pustejovsky’s four Qualia (which are, essentially, properties expressing formal, agentive, constitutive and telic meanings; see Pustejovsky 1995) are used to specify certain aspects of word meaning, and a common library of 140 template types is used to guide acquisition in all languages (Lenci et al 2000a, 2000b). Lenci et al. 2000b (p. 5) summarize the information that can be represented in a SIMPLE lexicon entry: “i) semantic type, corresponding to the template the SemU (semantic unit) instantiates; ii) domain information; iii) lexicographic gloss; iv) argument structure for predicative SemUs; v) selectional restrictions on the arguments; vi) event type, to characterise the aspectual properties of verbal predicates; vii) link of the </context>

Another, in our view, insufficiently explained aspect of SIMPLE is the priority given to Qualia as descriptors of lexical items. The original inventory of Qualia (from Pustejovsky 1995) consists of only four properties of the hundreds that can usefully be used to link concepts for purposes of NLP. Lenci et al. (2000b) address this issue as follows: “Although they [the four Qualia] clearly do not exhaust the semantic content of lexical items, Pustejovsky (1995) has convincingly shown that these four Qualia dimensions play a particularly prominent role in determining the linguistic behavior of word senses, as well as in the explanation of the generative mechanisms at the basis of lexical creativity. Qualia-based information can be specified for all the parts of speech, althoug</context>
