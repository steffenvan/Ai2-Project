We are pleased to present the proceedings of the ACL 2010 Workshop on Applications of Tree Automata
in Natural Language Processing, which will be held on July 16 in Uppsala, Sweden, following the 48th
Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).
The theory of tree automata has always had a close connection with natural language processing. In
the 1960s, computational linguistics was the major driving force for the development of a theory of tree
automata. However, the number of successful applications of this theory to natural language processing
remained small during the 20th century. This situation has now changed. Applications of tree automata
in natural language processing can be found in work on topics as diverse as grammar formalisms,
computational semantics, language generation, and machine translation. Researchers in natural language
processing have recognized the usefulness of tree automata theory for solving the problems they are
interested in, and theorists are inspired by the resulting theoretical questions.
The goals of this workshop are to provide a dedicated venue for the presentation of work that relates the
theory of tree automata to natural language processing, and to create a forum where researchers from
the two areas can meet and exchange ideas. Specifically, the workshop aims at raising the awareness
for theoretical results useful for applications in natural language processing, and at identifying open
theoretical problems raised by such applications.
We are very happy that Kevin Knight (ISI/University of Southern California, USA), certainly the most
recognized ambassador for tree automata techniques in machine translation, agreed to give one of his
stimulating invited lectures.
For the workshop, authors were invited to submit full papers and proposals for quickfire presentations,
the latter being a means for triggering discussions and an exchange of ideas. After a thorough reviewing
process with three reviews per full paper, six full papers and four quickfire presentations were accepted
for the workshop. The quality and diversity of the papers accepted ensures an interesting and inspiring
workshop that we look forward to.
We thank the members of the program committee for their support, and in particular for being careful
reviewers of the papers submitted. Furthermore, we would like to thank the program chairs, Sandra
Carberry and Stephen Clark, as well as the workshop chairs, Pushpak Bhattacharyia and David Weir, for
their friendly and professional assistance.
We hope that all participants of the workshop will experience an inspiring event characterized by
curiosity and an open-minded atmosphere, and that all readers of these proceedings will gain new insights
that make a difference.
