Sentence fusion is a text-to-text (revision-like) gen-
eration task which takes related sentences as input
and merges these into a single output sentence. In
this paper we describe our ongoing work on de-
veloping a sentence fusion module for Dutch. We
propose a generalized version of alignment which
not only indicates which words and phrases should
be aligned but also labels these in terms of a small
set of primitive semantic relations, indicating how
words and phrases from the two input sentences re-
late to each other. It is shown that human label-
ers can perform this task with a high agreement (F-
score of .95). We then describe and evaluate our
adaptation of an existing automatic alignment al-
gorithm, and use the resulting alignments, plus the
semantic labels, in a generalized fusion and gen-
eration algorithm. A small-scale evaluation study
reveals that most of the resulting sentences are ad-
equate to good.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.980942793814434">
Traditionally, Natural Language Generation (NLG) is defined
as the automatic production of “meaningful texts in (...) hu-
man language from some underlying non-linguistic represen-
tation of information” [Reiter and Dale, 2000, xvii]. Re-
cently, there is an increased interest in NLG applications
that produce meaningful text from meaningful text rather than
from abstract meaning representations. Such applications
are sometimes referred to as text-to-text generation applica-
tions (e.g., [Chandrasekar and Bangalore, 1997], [Knight and
Marcu, 2002], [Lapata, 2003]), and may be likened to ear-
lier revision-based generation strategies, e.g. [Robin, 1994]
[Callaway and Lester, 1997]. Text-to-text generation is often
motivated from practical applications such as summarization,
sentence simplification, and sentence compression. One rea-
son for the interest in such generation systems is the possi-
bility to automatically learn text-to-text generation strategies
from corpora of parallel text.
∗This work was carried out within the IMIX-IMOGEN (Inter-
active Multimodal Output Generation) project, sponsored by the
Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO).
In this paper, we take a closer look at sentence fusion
[Barzilay, 2003][Barzilay et al., 1999], one of the interesting
variants in text-to-text generation. A sentence fusion module
takes related sentences as input, and generates a single sen-
tence summarizing the input sentences. The general strategy
described in [Barzilay, 2003] is to first align the dependency
structures of the two input sentences to find the common in-
formation in both sentences. On the basis of this alignment,
the common information is framed into an fusion tree (i.e.,
capturing the shared information), which is subsequently re-
alized in natural language by generating all traversals of the
fusion tree and scoring their probability using an n-gram lan-
guage model. Of the sentences thus generated the one with
the lowest (length normalized) entropy is selected.
Barzilay and co-workers apply sentence fusion in the con-
text of multi-document summarization, where the input sen-
tences typically come from multiple documents describing
the same event, but sentence fusion seems to be useful for
other applications as well. In question-answering, for in-
stance, sentence fusion could be used to generate more com-
plete answers. Many current QA systems use various parallel
answer-finding strategies, each of which may produce an N-
best list of answers (e.g., [Maybury, 2004]) In response to a
question like “What causes RSI?” one potential answer sen-
tence could be:
RSI can be caused by repeating the same sequence
of movements many times an hour or day.
And another might be:
RSI is generally caused by a mixture of poor er-
gonomics, stress and poor posture.
These two incomplete answers might be fused into a more
complete answer such as:
RSI can be caused by a mixture of poor er-
gonomics, stress, poor posture and by repeating the
same sequence of movements many times an hour
or day.
The same process of sentence fusion can of course be applied
to the whole list of N-best answers in order to derive a more
specific, or even the most specific, answer, akin to taking the
union of a number of sets. Likewise, we can rely on sentence
fusion to derive a more general answer, or even the most gen-
eral one (cf. intersection), in the hope that this will filter out
irrelevant parts of the answer.
Arguably, such applications call for a generalized version
of sentence fusion, which may have consequences for the var-
ious components (alignment, fusion and generation) of the
sentence fusion pipeline. At the alignment level, we would
like to have a better understanding of how words and phrases
in the input sentences relate to each other. Rather than a bi-
nary choice (align or not), one might want to distinguish more
fine-grained relations such as overlap (if two phrases share
some but not all of their content), paraphrases (if two phrases
express the same information in different ways), entailments
(if one phrase entails the other, but not vice versa), etc. Such
an alignment strategy would be especially useful for applica-
tions such as question answering and information extraction,
where it is often important to know whether two sentences
are paraphrases or stand in an entailment relation [Dagan and
Glickman, 2004]. In the fusion module, we are interested in
the possibilities to generate various kinds of fusions depend-
ing on the relations between the respective sentences, e.g., se-
lecting the more specific or the more general phrase depend-
ing on whether the fusion tree is an intersection or a union
one. Finally, the generation may be more complicated in the
generalized version, and it is an interesting question whether
the use of language models is equally suitable for different
kinds of fusion.
In this paper, we will explore some of these issues re-
lated to a generalized version of sentence fusion. We start
with the basic question whether it is possible at all to reli-
ably align sentences, including different potential relations
between words and phrases (section 2). We then present our
ongoing work on sentence fusion, describing the current sta-
tus and performance of the alignment algorithm (section 3),
as well as the fusion and generation components (section 4).
We end with discussion and description of future plans in sec-
tion 5.

2.1 General approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983952380953">
Alignment has become standard practice in data-driven ap-
proaches to machine translation (e.g. [Och and Ney, 2000]).
Initially work focused on word-based alignment, but more re-
cent research also addresses alignment at the higher levels
(substrings, syntactic phrases or trees), e.g.,[Gildea, 2003].
The latter approach seems most suitable for current purposes,
where we want to express that a sequence of words in one
sentence is related to a non-identical sequence of words in
another sentence (a paraphrase, for instance). However, if
we allow alignment of arbitrary substrings of two sentences,
then the number of possible alignments grows exponentially
to the number of tokens in the sentences, and the process of
alignment – either manually or automatically – may become
infeasible. An alternative, which seems to occupy the middle
ground between word alignment on the one hand and align-
ment of arbitrary substrings on the other, is to align syntac-
tic analyses. Here, following [Barzilay, 2003], we will align
sentences at the level of dependency structures. Unlike to
[Barzilay, 2003], we are interested in a number of different
alignment relations between sentences, and pay special atten-
tion to the feasibility of this alignment task.

2.2 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953666666667">
For evaluation and parameter estimation we have developed
a parallel monolingual corpus consisting of two different
Dutch translations of the French book “Le petit prince” (the
little prince) by Antoine de Saint-Exup´ery (published 1943),
one by Laetitia de Beaufort-van Hamel (1966) and one by
Ernst Altena (2000). The texts were automatically tokenized
and split into sentences, after which errors were manually
corrected. Corresponding sentences from both translations
were manually aligned; in most cases this was a one-to-one
mapping but occasionally a single sentence in one version
mapped onto two sentences in the other: Next, the Alpino
parser for Dutch (e.g., [Bouma et al., 2001]) was used for
part-of-speech tagging and lemmatizing all words, and for
assigning a dependency analysis to all sentences. The POS
labels indicate the major word class (e.g. verb, noun, pron,
and adv). The dependency relations hold between tokens
and are the same as used in the Spoken Dutch Corpus (see
e.g., [van der Wouden et al., 2002]). These include depen-
dencies such as head/subject, head/modifier and coordina-
tion/conjunction. See Figure 1 for an example. If a full parse
could not be obtained, Alpino produced partial analyses col-
lected under a single root node. Errors in lemmatization, POS
tagging, and syntactic dependency parsing were not subject to
manual correction.

2.3 Task definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974905">
A dependency analysis of a sentence S yields a labeled di-
rected graph D = hV, Ei, where V (vertices) are the nodes,
and E (edges) are the dependency relations. For each node
v in the dependency structure for a sentence S, we define
STR(v) as the substring of all tokens under v (i.e., the com-
position of the tokens of all nodes reachable from v). For
example, the string associated with node persoon in Figure 1
is heel veel serieuze personen (‘very many serious persons’).
An alignment between sentences S and S&apos; pairs nodes from
the dependency graphs for both sentences. Aligning node v
from the dependency graph D of sentence S with node v&apos;
from the graph D&apos; of S&apos; indicates that there is a relation be-
tween STR(v) and STR(v&apos;), i.e., between the respective sub-
strings associated with v and v&apos;. We distinguish five potential,
mutually exclusive, relations between nodes (with illustrative
examples):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.884913642857143">
1. v equals v&apos; iff STR(v) and STR(v&apos;) are literally identical
(abstracting from case and word order)
Example: “a small and a large boa-constrictor” equals
“a large and a small boa-constrictor”;
2. v restates v&apos; iffSTR(v) is aparaphrase of STR(v&apos;) (same
information content but different wording),
Example: “a drawing of a boa-constrictor snake” re-
states “a drawing of a boa-constrictor”;
3. v specifies v&apos; iff STR(v) is more specific than STR(v&apos;),
Example: “the planet B 612” specifies “the planet”;
4. v generalizes v&apos; iff STR(v&apos;) is more specific than
STR(v),
Example: “the planet” generalizes “the planet B 612”;
5. v intersects v&apos; iff STR(v) and STR(v&apos;) share some in-

<bodyText confidence="0.982171833333333">
formational content, but also each express some piece of
information not expressed in the other,
Example: “Jupiter and Mars” intersects “Mars and
Venus”
Note that there is an intuitive relation with entailment here:
both equals and restates can be understood as mutual entail-
ment (i.e., if the root nodes of the analyses corresponding S
and S&apos; stand in an equal or restate relation, S entails S&apos; and
S&apos; entails S), if S specifies S&apos; then S also entails S&apos; and if S
generalizes S&apos; then S is entailed by S&apos;.
An alignment between S and S&apos; can now formally be
defined on the basis of the respective dependency graphs

For creating manual alignments, we developed a special-

Dependency Graphs and Equivalent Tokens’). It shows, side
by side, two sentences, as well as their respective dependency
graphs. When the user clicks on a node v in the graph, the cor-
responding string (STR(v)) is shown at the bottom. The tool
enables the user to manually construct an alignment graph on
the basis of the respective dependency graphs. This is done
by focusing on a node in the structure for one sentence, and
then selecting a corresponding node (if possible) in the other
structure, after which the user can select the relevant align-
ment relation. The tool offers additional support for folding
parts of the graphs, highlighting unaligned nodes and hiding
dependency relation labels. See Figure 4 in the Appendix for
a screen shot of Gadget.

2.5 Results

All text material was aligned by the two authors. They started
doing the first ten sentences of chapter one together in order
to get a feel for the task. They continued with the remaining
sentences from chapter one individually. The total number
of nodes in the two translations of the chapter was 445 and
399 respectively. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated
for two aspects: alignment and relation labeling. With respect
to alignment, we calculated the precision, recall and F-score
(with β = 1) on aligned node pairs as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.995438">
precision(Areal, Apred) = |Areal ∩ Apred |(1)

F-score = (3)

where Areal is the set of all real alignments (the reference or
golden standard), Apred is the set of all predicted alignments,
and Apred∩Areal is the set all correctly predicted alignments.
For the purpose of calculating inter-annotator agreement, one
of the annotations (A1) was considered the ‘real’ alignment,
the other (A2) the ‘predicted’. The results are summarized in
Table 1 in column (A1, A2).
Next, both annotators discussed the differences in align-
ment, and corrected mistaken or forgotten alignments. This
improved their agreement as shown in column (A10, A20). In

addition, they agreed on a single consensus annotation (Ac).
The last two columns of Table 1 show the results of evalu-
ating each of the revised annotations against this consensus
annotation. The F-score of .96 can therefore be regarded as
the upper bound on the alignment task.
In a similar way, the agreement was calculated for the task
of labeling the alignment relations. Results are shown in Ta-
ble 2, where the measures are weighted precision, recall and
F-score. For instance, the precision is the weighted sum of
the separate precision scores for each of the five relations.
The table also shows the κ-score, which is another commonly
used measure for inter-annotator agreement [Carletta, 1996].
Again, the F-score of .97 can be regarded as the upper bound
on the relation labeling task.
We think these numbers indicate that the labeled alignment
task is well defined and can be accomplished with a high level
of inter-annotator agreement.

3.1 Tree alignment algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828411764706">
The tree alignment algorithm is based on [Meyers et al.,
1996], and similar to that used in [Barzilay, 2003]. It cal-
culates the match between each node in dependency tree D
against each node in dependency tree D&apos;. The score for each
pair of nodes only depends on the similarity of the words
associated with the nodes and, recursively, on the scores of
the best matching pairs of their descendants. For an efficient
implementation, dynamic programming is used to build up a
score matrix, which guarantees that each score will be calcu-
lated only once.
Given two dependency trees D and D&apos;, the algorithm
builds up a score function S(v, v&apos;) for matching each node
v in D against each node v&apos; in D&apos;, which is stored in a ma-
trix M. The value S(v, v&apos;) is the score for the best match
between the two subtrees rooted at v in D and at v&apos; in D&apos;.
When a value for S(v, v&apos;) is required, and is not yet in the
matrix, it is recursively computed by the following formula:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.940754">
I TREEMATCH(v, v&apos;)
maxi=1,...,n S(vi, v&apos;)
maxj=1,...,m S(v,vj&apos;)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.993869">
where v1, ... , vn denote the children of v and v&apos;1, ... , v&apos;m de-
note the children of v&apos;. The three terms correspond to the
three ways that nodes can be aligned: (1) v can be directly
aligned to v&apos;; (2) any of the children of v can be aligned to v&apos;;
(3) v can be aligned to any of the children of v&apos;. Notice that
the last two options imply skipping one or more edges, and
leaving one or more nodes unaligned.1
The function TREEMATCH(v, v&apos;) is a measure of how well
the subtrees rooted at v and v&apos; match:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992153">
TREEMATCH(v, v&apos;) = NODEMATCH(v, v&apos;) +

�E (RELMATCH(v i, v j) + S(vi, v&apos;j)) �
(i,j) E p
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97914092">
Here V i denotes the dependency relation from v to vi.
P(v, v&apos;) is the set of all possible pairings of the n children
of v against the m children of v&apos;, which is the power set of
{1, . . . ,n} x {1, ... , m}. The summation in (5) ranges over
all pairs, denoted by (i, j), which appear in a given pairing
p E P(v, v&apos;). Maximizing this summation thus amounts to
finding the optimal alignment of children of v to children of
v&apos;.
NODEMATCH(v, v&apos;) &gt; 0 is a measure of how well the
label of node v matches the label of v&apos;.
RELMATCH(v i, V&apos;j) &gt; 0 is a measure for how well the
dependency relation between node v and its child vi matches
that of the dependency relation between node v&apos; and its child
vj.
Since the dependency graphs delivered by the Alpino
parser were usually not trees, they required some modifica-
tion in order to be suitable input for the tree alignment al-
gorithm. We first determined a root node, which is defined
as a node from which all other nodes in the graph can be
reached. In the rare case of multiple root nodes, an arbi-
trary one was chosen. Starting from this root node, any cyclic
edges were temporarily removed during a depth-first traver-
sal of the graph. The resulting directed acyclic graphs may
still have some amount of structure sharing, but this poses no
problem for the algorithm.

3.2 Evaluation of automatic alignment

<bodyText confidence="0.939168571428571">
We evaluated the automatic alignment of nodes, abstracting
from relation labels, as we have no algorithm for automatic
labeling of these relations yet. The baseline is achieved by
aligning those nodes with stand in an equals relation to each
other, i.e., a node v in D is aligned to a node v&apos; in D&apos; iff
STR(v) =STR(v&apos;). This alignment can be constructed rela-
tively easy.
The alignment algorithm is tested with the following
NODEMATCH function:

It reserves the highest value for a literal string match, a some-
what lower value for matching lemmas, and an even lower
value in case of a synonym, hyperonym or hyponym relation.
The latter relations are retrieved from the Dutch part of Eu-
roWordnet [Vossen, 1998]. For the RELMATCH function, we
simply used a value of 1 for identical dependency relations,
and 0 otherwise. These values were found to be adequate in a
number of test runs on two other, manually aligned chapters
(these chapters were not used for the actual evaluation). In the
future we intend to experiment with automatic optimizations.
We measured the alignment accuracy defined as the per-
centage of correctly aligned node pairs, where the consen-
sus alignment of the first chapter served as the golden stan-
dard. The results are summarized in Table 3. In order to test
the contribution of synonym and hyperonym information for
node matching, performance is measured with and without
the use of Eurowordnet. The results show that the algorithm
improves substantially on the baseline. The baseline already
achieves a relatively high score (an F-score of .56), which
may be attributed to the nature of our material: the translated
sentence pairs are relatively close to each other and may show
a sizeable amount of literal string overlap. The alignment al-
gorithm (without use of EuroWordnet) loses a few points on
precision, but improves a lot on recall (a 200% increase with
respect to the baseline), which in turn leads to a substantial
improvement on the overall F-score. The use of Euroword-
net leads to a small increase (two points) on both precision
and recall (and thus to small increase on F-score). Yet, in
comparison with the gold standard human score for this task
(.95), there is clearly room for further improvement.

The remaining two steps in the sentence fusion process are
merging and generation. In general, merging amounts to de-
ciding which information from either sentence should be pre-
served, whereas generation involves producing a grammat-
ically correct surface representation. In order to get an idea
about the baseline performance, we explored a simple, some-
what naive string-based approach. Below, the pseudocode
is shown for merging two dependency trees in order to get
restatements. Given a labeled alignment A between depen-
dency graphs D and D&apos;, if there is a restates relation between
node v from D and node v&apos; from D&apos;, we add the string real-
ization of v&apos; as an alternative to those of v.

3 then STR(v) ← STR(v) ∨ STR(v&apos;)
The generalization procedure adds the option to omit the re-
alization of a modifier that is not aligned:
GENERALIZE(D, A)

2 do if l = specifies
3 then STR(v) ← STR(v) ∨ STR(v&apos;)

<bodyText confidence="0.998884542857143">
where MOD-DEP-REL is the set of dependency relations be-
tween a node and a modifier (e.g. head/mod and head/predm).
Each procedure is repeated twice, once adding substrings
from D into D&apos; and once the other way around. Next, we
traverse the dependency trees and generate all string realiza-
tions, extending the list of variants for each node that has mul-
tiple realizations. Finally, we filter out multiple copies of the
same string, as well as strings that are identical to the input
sentences.
This procedure for merging and generation was applied to
the 35 sentence pairs from the consensus alignment of chapter
one of “Le Petit Prince”. Overall this gave rise to 194 restate-
ment, 62 specifications and 177 generalizations, with some
sentence pairs leading to many variants and others to none at
all. Some output showed only minor variations, for instance,
substitution of a synonym. However, others revealed surpris-
ingly adequate generalizations or specifications. Examples of
good and bad output are given in Figure 2.
As expected, many of the resulting variants are ungram-
matical, because constraints on word order, agreement or sub-
categorisation are violated. Following work on statistical sur-
face generation [Langkilde and Knight, 1998] and other work
on sentence fusion [Barzilay, 2003], we tried to filter un-
grammatical variants with an n-gram language model. The
Cambridge-CMU Statistical Modeling Toolkit v2 was used to
train a 3-gram model on over 250M words from the Twente
Newscorpus , using back-off and Good-Turing smoothing.
Variants were ranked in order of increasing entropy. We
found, however, that the ranking was often inadequate, show-
ing ungrammatical variants at the top and grammatical vari-
ants in the lower regions.
To gain some insight into the general performance of the
merging and generation strategy, we performed a small eval-
uation test in which the two authors independently judged all
generated variants in terms of three categories:

task is .75, indicating a moderate to good agreement between
the judges. Roughly half of the generated restatements and
generalization are perfect, while this is not the case for spec-
ifications. We have no plausible explanation for this yet.
We think we can conclude from this evaluation that sen-
tence fusion is a viable and interesting approach for produc-
ing restatements, generalization and specifications. However,
there is certainly further work to do; the procedure for merg-
ing dependency graphs should be extended, and the realiza-
tion model clearly requires more linguistic sophistication in
particular to deal with word order, agreement and subcate-
gorisation constraints.

5 Discussion and Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992203125">
In this paper we have described our ongoing work on sen-
tence fusion for Dutch. Starting point was the sentence fusion
model proposed by [Barzilay et al., 1999; Barzilay, 2003]
in which dependency analyses of pairs of sentences are first
aligned, after which the aligned parts (representing the com-
mon information) are fused. The resulting fused dependency
tree is subsequently transfered into natural language. Our
new contributions are primarily in two areas. First, we carried
out an explicit evaluation of the alignment – both human and
automatic alignment – whereas [Barzilay, 2003] only evalu-
ates the output of the complete sentence fusion process. We
found that annotators can reliably align phrases and assign
relation labels to them, and that good results can be achieved
with automatic alignment, certainly above an informed base-
line, albeit still below human performance. Second, Barzi-
lay and co-workers developed their sentence fusion model in
the context of multi-document summarization, but arguably
the approach could also be applicable for applications such
as question answering or information extraction. This seems
to call for a more refined version of sentence fusion, which
has consequences for alignment, merging and realization. We
have therefore introduced five different types of semantic re-
lations between strings, namely equals, restates, specifies,
generalizes and intersects. This increases the expressiveness
of the representation, and supports generating restatements,
generalizations and specifications. Finally, we described and
evaluated our first results on sentence realization based on
these refined alignments, with promising results.
Similar work is described in [Pang et al., 2003], who de-
scribe a syntax-based algorithm that builds word lattices from
parallel translations which can be used to generate new para-
phrases. Their alignment algorithm is less refined, and there
is only type of alignment and hence output (only restate-
ments), but their mapping of aligned trees to a word lattice
(or FSA) seems worthwhile to explore in combination with
the approach we have proposed here.
One of the issues that remains to be addressed in future
work is the effect of parsing errors. Such errors were not
manually corrected, but during manual alignment, however,
we sometimes found that substrings could not be properly
aligned because the parser failed to identify them as syntac-
tic constituents. The repercussions of this for the generation
should be investigated by comparing the results obtained here
with alignments on perfect parses. Furthermore, our work on
automatic alignment so far only concerned the alignment of
nodes, not the determination of the relation type. We intend
to address this task with machine learning, initially relying
on shallow features such as the length of the respective token
strings and the amount of overlap. It is also clear that more
work is needed on merging and surface realization. One pos-
sible direction here is to exploit the relatively rich linguistic
representation of the input sentences (POS tags, lemmas and
dependency structures), for instance, along the lines of [Ban-
galore and Rambow, 2000]. Yet another issue concerns the
type of text material. The sentence pairs from our current cor-
pus are relatively close, in the sense that there is usually a 1-
to-1 mapping between sentences, and both translations more
or less convey the same information. Although this seems a
good starting point to study alignment, we intend to continue
with other types of text material in future work. For instance,
in extending our work to the actual output of a QA system,
we expect to encounter sentences with far less overlap. Of
particular interest to us is also whether sentence fusion can
be shown to improve the quality of QA system output.

<abstract confidence="0.9946806">Sentence fusion is a text-to-text (revision-like) generation task which takes related sentences as input and merges these into a single output sentence. In this paper we describe our ongoing work on developing a sentence fusion module for Dutch. We propose a generalized version of alignment which not only indicates which words and phrases should be aligned but also labels these in terms of a small set of primitive semantic relations, indicating how words and phrases from the two input sentences relate to each other. It is shown that human labelers can perform this task with a high agreement (Fscore of .95). We then describe and evaluate our adaptation of an existing automatic alignment algorithm, and use the resulting alignments, plus the semantic labels, in a generalized fusion and generation algorithm. A small-scale evaluation study reveals that most of the resulting sentences are adequate to good.</abstract>
