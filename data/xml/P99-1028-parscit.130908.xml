This paper deals with translation ambiguity and
target polysemy problems together. Two
monolingual balanced corpora are employed to
learn word co-occurrence for translation
ambiguity resolution, and augmented translation
restrictions forâ€¢ target polysemy resolution.
Experiments show that the model achieves
62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and
is 40.80% addition to the select-all model.
Combining the target polysemy resolution, the
retrieval performance is about 10.11% increase to
the model resolving translation ambiguity only.

Cross language information retrieval (CUR)
(Oard and DOIT, 1996; Oard, 1997) deals with the
use of queries in one language to access
documents in another. Due to the differences
between source and target languages, query
translation is usually employed to unify the
language in queries and documents. In query
translation, translation ambiguity is a basic
problem to be resolved. A word in a source
query may have more than one sense. Word
sense disambiguation identifies the correct sense
of each source word, and lexical selection
translates it into the corresponding target word.
The above procedure is similar to lexical choice
operation in a traditional machine translation (MT)
system. However, there is a significant
difference between the applications of MT and
CLIR. In MT, readers interpret the translated
results. If the target word has more than one
sense, readers can disambiguate its meaning
automatically. Comparatively, the translated
result is sent to a monolingual information
retrieval system in CLIR. The target polysemy
adds extraneous senses and affects the retrieval
performance.
Some different approaches have been proposed
for query translation. Dictionary-based approach
exploits machine-readable dictionaries and
selection strategies like select all (Hull and
Grefenstette, 1996; Davis, 1997), randomly select
N (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Kwok 1997) and
select best N (Hayashi, Kikui and Susaki, 1997;
Davis 1997). Corpus-based approaches exploit
sentence-aligned corpora (Davis and Dunning,
1996) and document-aligned corpora (Sheridan
and Ballerini, 1996). These two approaches are
complementary. Dictionary provides translation
candidates, and corpus provides context to fit user
intention. Coverage of dictionaries, alignment
performance and domain shift of corpus are major
problems of these two approaches. Hybrid
approaches (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Bian and
Chen, 1998; Davis 1997) integrate both lexical
and corpus knowledge.
All the above approaches deal with the
translation ambiguity problem in query translation.
Few touch on translation ambiguity and target
polysemy together. This paper will study the
multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and
target polysemy in cross-language information
retrieval systems, and propose a new translation
method to resolve these problems. Section 2
shows the effects of translation ambiguity and
target polysemy in Chinese-English and English-
Chinese information retrievals. Section 3
presents several models to revolve translation
ambiguity and target polysemy problems.
Section 4 demonstrates the experimental results,
and compares the performances of the proposed
models. Section 5 concludes the remarks.

Translation ambiguity and target polysemy are
two major problems in CDR. Translation
ambiguity results from the source language, and
target polysemy occurs in target language. Take
Chinese-English information retrieval (CEIR) and
English-Chinese information retrieval (ECIR) as
examples. The former uses Chinese queries to

retrieve English documents, while the later
employs English queries to retrieve Chinese
documents. To explore the difficulties in the
query translation of different languages, we gather
the sense statistics of English and Chinese words.
Table 1 shows the degree of word sense ambiguity
(in terms of number of senses) in English and in
Chinese, respectively. A Chinese thesaurus, i.e.,
.4,19 1 W (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2), (Mei, et al.,
1982) and an English thesaurus, i.e., Roget&apos;s
thesaurus, are used to count the statistics of the
senses of words. On the average, an English
word has 1.687 senses, and a Chinese word has
1.397 senses. If the top 1000 high frequent
words are considered, the English words have
3.527 senses, and the bi-character Chinese words
only have 1.504 senses. In summary, Chinese
word is comparatively unambiguous, so that
translation ambiguity is not serious but target
polysemy is serious in CEIR. In contrast, an
English word is usually ambiguous. The
translation disambiguation is important in ECIR.
Consider an example in CEIR. The Chinese
word &amp;quot;0.4-1-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2) is unambiguous, but its
English translation &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; has 9 senses (Longman,
1978). When the Chinese word &amp;quot; &amp;quot;
(yin2hang2) is issued, it is translated into the
English counterpart &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; by dictionary lookup
without difficulty, and then &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; is sent to an IR
system. The IR system will retrieve documents
that contain this word. Because &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; is not
disambiguated, irrelevant documents will be
reported. On the contrary, when &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; is
submitted to an ECIR system, we must
disambiguate its meaning at first. If we can find
that its correct translation is &amp;quot;ig.4-1-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2),
the subsequent operation is very simple. That is,
&amp;quot;4414-5-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2) is sent into an IR system, and
then documents containing &amp;quot;4-1-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2)
will be presented. In this example, translation
disambiguation should be done rather than target
polysemy resolution.
The above examples do not mean translation
disambiguation is not required in CEIR. Some
Chinese words may have more than one sense.
For example, &amp;quot;ittb&amp;quot; (yun4dong4) has the
following meanings (Lai and Lin, 1987): (1) sport,
(2) exercise, (3) movement, (4) motion, (5)
campaign, and (6) lobby. Each corresponding
English word may have more than one sense.
For example, &amp;quot;exercise&amp;quot; may mean a question or
set of questions to be answered by a pupil for
practice; the use of a power or right; and so on.
The multiplication effects of translation ambiguity
and target polysemy make query translation
harder.

3. Translation Ambiguity and Polysemy
Resolution Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977590625">
In the recent works, Ballesteros and Croft
(1998), and Bian and Chen (1998) employ
dictionaries and co-occurrence statistics trained
from target language documents to deal with
translation ambiguity. We will follow our
previous work (Bian and Chen, 1998), which
combines the dictionary-based and corpus-based
approaches for CEIR. A bilingual dictionary
provides the translation equivalents of each query
term, and the word co-occurrence information
trained from a target language text collection is
used to disambiguate the translation. This
method considers the content around the
translation equivalents to decide the best target
word. The translation of a query term can be
disambiguated using the co-occurrence of the
translation equivalents of this term and other
terms. We adopt mutual information (Church, et
al., 1989) to measure the strength. This
disambiguation method performs good
translations even when the multi-term phrases are
not found in the bilingual dictionary, or the
phrases are not identified in the source language.
Before discussion, we take Chinese-English
information retrieval as an example to explain our
methods. Consider the Chinese query &amp;quot;ip..4-1--&amp;quot;
(yin2hang2) to an English collection again. The
ambiguity grows from none (source side) to 9
senses (target side) during query translation.
How to incorporate the knowledge from source
side to target side is an important issue. To
avoid the problem of target polysemy in query
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.997550928571428">
translation, we have to restrict the use of a target
word by augmenting some other words that
usually co-occur with it. That is, we have to
make a context for the target word. In our
method, the contextual information is derived
from the source word.
We collect the frequently accompanying nouns
and verbs for each word in a Chinese corpus.
Those words that co-occur with a given word
within a window are selected. The word
association strength of a word and its
accompanying words is measured by mutual
information. For each word C in a Chinese
query, we augment it with a sequence of Chinese
words trained in the above way. Let these words
be CW,, CW2, ..., and CW.. Assume the
corresponding English translations of C, CW1,
CW2, ..., and CWâ€ž, are E, EW1, EW2, ..., and EWâ€žâ€ž
respectively. EW,, EW2, ..., and EWn, form an
augmented translation restriction of E for C. In
other words, the list (E, EW,, EW2, EWâ€ž,) is
called an augmented translation result for C.
EWâ€ž EW2, ..., and EWm are a pseudo English
context produced from Chinese side. Consider
the Chinese word &amp;quot;itt.tt&amp;quot; (yin2hang2). Some
strongly co-related Chinese words in ROCLING
balanced corpus (Huang, et al., 1995) are: &amp;quot;ROC
(tielxian4), &amp;quot;4k &amp;quot; (ling3chul), 4&apos;7&amp;quot; (1i3ang2),
&amp;quot;4&apos; Pt&amp;quot; (yal hui4), 3t,&amp;quot; (hui4dui4), etc. Thus
the augmented translation restriction of &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; is
(rebate, show out, Lyons, negotiate, transfer, ...).
Unfortunately, the query translation is not so
simple. A word C in a query Q may be
ambiguous. Besides, the accompanying words
CW, (1 i 5_ m) trained from Chinese corpus may
be translated into more than one English word.
An augmented translation restriction may add
erroneous patterns when a word in a restriction
has more than one sense. Thus we devise several
models to discuss the effects of augmented
restrictions. Figure 1 shows the different models
and the model refinement procedure. A Chinese
query may go through translation ambiguity
resolution module (left-to-right), target polysemy
resolution module (top-down), or both (i.e., these
two modules are integrated at the right corner).
In the following, we will show how each module
is operated independently, and how the two
modules are combined.
For a Chinese query which is composed of n
words Câ€ž C2, ..., Cn, find the corresponding
English translation equivalents in a Chinese-
English bilingual dictionary. To discuss the
propagation errors from translation ambiguity
resolution part in the experiments, we consider the
following two alternatives:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.466521">
(a) select all (do-nothing)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981988">
The strategy does nothing on the translation
disambiguation. All the English translation
equivalents for the n Chinese words are selected,
and are submitted to a monolingual information
retrieval system.
(b) co-occurrence model (Co-Model)
We adopt the strategy discussed previously
for translation disambiguation (Bian and Chen,
1998). This method considers the content
around the English translation equivalents to
decide the best target equivalent.
For target polysemy resolution part in Figure 1,
we also consider two alternatives. In the first
alternative (called A model), we augment
restrictions to all the words no matter whether
they are ambiguous or not. In the second
alternative (called U model), we neglect those Cs
that have more than one English translation.
Assume Cam, Co(2), C (p n) have only one
English translation. The restrictions are
augmented to Caw, Cam, ..., Co(p) only. We apply
the above corpus-based method to find the
restriction for each English word selected by the
translation ambiguity resolution model. Recall
that the restrictions are derived from Chinese
corpus. The accompanying words trained from
Chinese corpus may be translated into more than
one English word. Here, the translation
ambiguity may occur when translating the
restrictions. Three alternatives are considered.
In Ul (or Al) model, the terms without ambiguity,
i.e., Chinese and English words are one-to-one
correspondent in a Chinese-English bilingual
dictionary, are added. In UT (or AT) model, the
terms with the same parts of speech (POSes) are
added. That is, POS is used to select English
word. In UTT (or ATT) model, we use mutual
information to select top 10 accompanying terms
of a Chinese query word, and POS is used to
obtain the augmented translation restriction.

In the above treatment, a word C, in a query Q
is translated into (E,, EW&amp;quot;, EW,2, EW,â€žâ€ž). E,
is selected by Co-Model, and EW&amp;quot;, EW12,
EW,,n, are augmented by different target polysemy
resolution models. Intuitively, E,, EW&amp;quot;, EW12,
should have different weights. E, is
assigned a higher weight, and the words EW&amp;quot;,
EW12, E, in the restriction are assigned lower
weights. They are determined by the following

Those English words whose POSes are the
same as the corresponding Chinese restrictions are
selected as augmented translation restriction.
For example, the translation of &amp;quot;its 4&amp;quot;_V (tao2bi4)
has two possible POSes, i.e., V and N, so only
&amp;quot;avoid&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;elude&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wangle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;welch&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;welsh&amp;quot;
are chosen. The other terms are added in the
similar way. Recall that we use mutual
information to select the top 10 accompanying
terms of a Chinese query term in ATT model.
The 5th row shows that the augmented translation
restrictions for &amp;quot; (suo3de2) and &amp;quot;ft&amp;quot; (sui4)
are removed because their top 10 Chinese
accompanying terms do not have English
translations of the same POSes. Finally, we
consider ATWCO model. The words &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;land&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;surtax&amp;quot; are selected from the three
lists in 3rd row of Table 3(b) respectively, by using
word co-occurrences.
Figure 2 shows the number of relevant
documents on the top 1000 retrieved documents
for Topics 332 and 337. The performances are
stable in all of the +weight (W) models and the
enhanced CO restriction (WCO) models, even
there are different number of words in translation
restrictions. Especially, the enhanced CO
restriction models add at most one translated
restriction word for each query term. They can
achieve the similar performance to those models
that add more translated restriction words.
Surprisingly, the augmented translation results
may perform better than the monolingual retrieval.
Topic 337 in Figure 2 is an example.
Table 4 shows the overall performance of 18
different models for 50 topics. Eleven-point
average precision on the top 1000 retrieved
documents is adopted to measure the performance
of all the experiments. The monolingual
information retrieval, i.e., the original English
queries to English text collection, is regarded as a
baseline model. The performance is 0.1459
under the specified environment. The select-all
model, i.e., all the translation equivalents are
passed without disambiguation, has 0.0652
average precision. About 44.69% of the
performance of the monolingual information
retrieval is achieved. When co-occurrence
model is employed to resolve translation
ambiguity, 0.0831 average precision (56.96% of
monolingual information retrieval) is reported.
Compared to do-nothing model, the performance
is 27.45% increase.
Now we consider the treatment of translation
ambiguity and target polysemy together.
Augmented restrictions are formed in Al, AT,
ATT, UI, UT and UTT models, however, their
performances are worse than Co-model
(translation disambiguation only). The major

reason is the restrictions may introduce errors.
That can be found from the fact that models Ul,
UT, and UTT are better than Al, AT, and ATT.
Because the translation of restriction from source
language (Chinese) to target language (English)
has the translation ambiguity problem, the models
(U1 and Al) introduce the unambiguous
restriction terms and perform better than other
models. Controlled augmentation shows higher
performance than uncontrolled augmentation.
When different weights are assigned to the
original English translation and the augmented
restrictions, all the models are improved
significantly. The performances of A1W, ATW,
ATTW, U1W, UTW, and UTTW are about
10.11% addition to the model for translation
disambiguation only. Of these models, the
performance change from model AT to model
ATW is drastic, i.e., from 0.0419 (28.72%) to
0.0913 (62.58%). It tells us the original English
translation plays a major role, but the augmented
restriction still has a significant effect on the
performance.
We know that restriction for each English
translation presents a pseudo English context.
Thus we apply the co-occurrence model again on
the pseudo English contexts. The performances
are increased a little. These models add at most
one translated restriction word for each query
term, but their performances are better than those
models that adding more translated restriction
words. It tells us that a good translated
restriction word for each query term is enough for
resolving target polysemy problem. U1WCO,
which is the best in these experiments, gains
62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and
40.80% increase to the do-nothing model (select-
all).

This paper deals with translation ambiguity and
target polysemy at the same time. We utilize
two monolingual balanced corpora to learn useful
statistical data, i.e., word co-occurrence for
translation ambiguity resolution, and translation
restrictions for target polysemy resolution.
Aligned bilingual corpus or special domain corpus
is not required in this design. Experiments show
that resolving both translation ambiguity and
target polysemy gains about 10.11% performance
addition to the method for translation
disambiguation in cross-language information
retrieval. We also analyze the two factors: word
sense ambiguity in source language (translation
ambiguity), and word sense ambiguity in target
language (target polysemy). The statistics of
word sense ambiguities have shown that target
polysemy resolution is critical in Chinese-English
information retrieval.
This treatment is very suitable to translate very
short query on Web. The queries on Web are
1.5-2 words on the average (Pinkerton, 1994;
Fitzpatrick and Dent, 1997). Because the major
components of queries are nouns, at least one
word of a short query of length 1.5-2 words is
noun. Besides, most of the Chinese nouns are
unambiguous, so that translation ambiguity is not
serious comparatively, but target polysemy is
critical in Chinese-English Web retrieval. The
translation restrictions, which introduce pseudo
contexts, are helpful for target polysemy
resolution. The applications of this method to
cross-language Internet searching, the
applicability of this method to other language
pairs, and the effects of human-computer
interaction on resolving translation ambiguity and
target polysemy will be studied in the future.

To discuss the propagation errors from translation ambiguity resolution part in the experiments, we consider the following two alternatives: (a) select all (do-nothing) The strategy does nothing on the translation disambiguation. All the English translation equivalents for the n Chinese words are selected, and are submitted to a monolingual information retrieval system. (b) co-occurrence model (Co-Model) We adopt the strategy discussed previously for translation disambiguation (Bian and Chen, 1998). This method considers the content around the English translation equivalents to decide the best target equivalent. For target polysemy resolution part in Figure 1, we also consider two alternatives. In the first alternative (called A model), we augment restrictions to all the words no matter whether they are ambiguous or not. In the second alternative (called U model), we neglect those Cs that have more than one English translation. Assume Cam, Co(2), C (p n) have only one English translation.

However, there is a significant difference between the applications of MT and CLIR. In MT, readers interpret the translated results. If the target word has more than one sense, readers can disambiguate its meaning automatically. Comparatively, the translated result is sent to a monolingual information retrieval system in CLIR. The target polysemy adds extraneous senses and affects the retrieval performance. Some different approaches have been proposed for query translation. Dictionary-based approach exploits machine-readable dictionaries and selection strategies like select all (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996; Davis, 1997), randomly select N (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Kwok 1997) and select best N (Hayashi, Kikui and Susaki, 1997; Davis 1997). Corpus-based approaches exploit sentence-aligned corpora (Davis and Dunning, 1996) and document-aligned corpora (Sheridan and Ballerini, 1996). These two approaches are complementary.

If we can find that its correct translation is &amp;quot;ig.4-1-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2), the subsequent operation is very simple. That is, &amp;quot;4414-5-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2) is sent into an IR system, and then documents containing &amp;quot;4-1-&amp;quot; (yin2hang2) will be presented. In this example, translation disambiguation should be done rather than target polysemy resolution. The above examples do not mean translation disambiguation is not required in CEIR. Some Chinese words may have more than one sense. For example, &amp;quot;ittb&amp;quot; (yun4dong4) has the following meanings (Lai and Lin, 1987): (1) sport, (2) exercise, (3) movement, (4) motion, (5) campaign, and (6) lobby. Each corresponding English word may have more than one sense. For example, &amp;quot;exercise&amp;quot; may mean a question or set of questions to be answered by a pupil for practice; the use of a power or right; and so on. The multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and target polysemy make query translation harder. 3.

Two monolingual balanced corpora are employed to learn word co-occurrence for translation ambiguity resolution, and augmented translation restrictions forâ€¢ target polysemy resolution. Experiments show that the model achieves 62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and is 40.80% addition to the select-all model. Combining the target polysemy resolution, the retrieval performance is about 10.11% increase to the model resolving translation ambiguity only. 1. Introduction Cross language information retrieval (CUR) (Oard and DOIT, 1996; Oard, 1997) deals with the use of queries in one language to access documents in another. Due to the differences between source and target languages, query translation is usually employed to unify the language in queries and documents. In query translation, translation ambiguity is a basic problem to be resolved. A word in a source query may have more than one sense. Word sense disambiguation identifies the correct sense of each source word, and lexical selection translates it into the corresponding target word. The above procedure is similar to lexical choice operation in a traditional machine translati</context>

We also analyze the two factors: word sense ambiguity in source language (translation ambiguity), and word sense ambiguity in target language (target polysemy). The statistics of word sense ambiguities have shown that target polysemy resolution is critical in Chinese-English information retrieval. This treatment is very suitable to translate very short query on Web. The queries on Web are 1.5-2 words on the average (Pinkerton, 1994; Fitzpatrick and Dent, 1997). Because the major components of queries are nouns, at least one word of a short query of length 1.5-2 words is noun. Besides, most of the Chinese nouns are unambiguous, so that translation ambiguity is not serious comparatively, but target polysemy is critical in Chinese-English Web retrieval.
