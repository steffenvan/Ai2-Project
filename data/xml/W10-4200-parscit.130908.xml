Preface
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993977447368421">
It gives us great pleasure to introduce the technical program of the Sixth In-
ternational Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2010), the biennial
meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Natural Language Generation
(SIGGEN). The INLG conference provides the premier forum for the discus-
sion, dissemination and archiving of research and results in the field of natural
language generation. Previous INLG conferences have been held in the USA,
Australia, the UK and Israel. Prior to 2000, INLG meetings were held as inter-
national workshops with a history stretching back to 1983. In 2010, on behalf
of SIGGEN, INLG is being co-hosted by Trinity College Dublin and the Dublin
Institute of Technology; and held in Trim Castle Hotel, Trim, Co. Meath, Ireland.
The INLG 2010 programme consists of presentations of substantial, original,
and previously unpublished results on all topics related to natural language
generation. This year we received 50 submissions (36 full papers and 14 short
papers) from 18 different countries from around the world. As in previous years,
each submission was reviewed by at least three members of an international
programme committee of leading researchers in the field. Based on these reviews
16 submissions were accepted as full papers and 8 as short papers (4 papers were
withdrawn). The accepted papers are of the highest quality and cover all of the
major aspects of natural language generation.
This year, the conference programme includes two keynote speakers. Su-
san E. Brennan, Professor of Psychology at Stony Brook University, will speak
on “Adapting Generation to Addressees: What Drives Audience Design?” and
Richard Power of The Open University will present a talk entitled “Ontologies
and Text: Can NLG Bridge the Gap?”. This year we are also delighted to host the
2010 Generation Challenges organised by Anja Belz, Albert Gatt and Alexander
Koller. This is a part of INLG that has been growing in importance over the last
number of conferences and is a great addition to the event.
The organising committee would like to offer their thanks to our invited
speakers for agreeing to join us, the organisers of INLG 2008 for their enormous
help, the SIGGEN board for allowing us host the conference and for their as-
sistance, Priscilla Rasmussen at ACL and Alena Moison at TCD for handling
finances, the programme committee for their dedicated work, and, most of all,
the authors of all submitted papers. We have also received generous sponsor-
ship from the Centre for Next Generation Localisation and Science Foundation
Ireland for which we are extremely grateful.
Finally, we would like to welcome you to Trim and hope that you have an
enjoyable and inspiring visit. We will leave you with an Irish proverb in the spirit
of INLG: Tir gan teanga, t´ır gan anam.

Abstract: Utterances are enormously variable in the forms they take. Al-
though variability is often treated as noise to be normalized or filtered out,
some who study spoken dialogprobably some in this communitysuspect that
this variability is meaningful. In this talk I will present experimental data about
partner-specific variability, or audience design. No one disputes that audience
design exists, but there is debate about how and why it emerges and whether it
matters. After discussing some systematic ways in which speakers adapt their ut-
terances to addressees, I will consider: What drives this adaptation? How does
it affect processing by addressees? And what are the implications for natural
language generation?
Bio: Susan Brennan is Professor of Psychology at Stony Brook University
and is also affiliated with the Departments of Linguistics and Computer Science.
She received a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Stanford University with a
focus on psycholinguistics; an M.S. from the MIT Media Lab, where she worked
on computer-generated caricatures and mediated communication; and a B.A. is
in cultural anthropology from Cornell University. She uses eyetracking and other
behavioral techniques to study language processing by interacting partners.

Abstract: Ontologies are akin to technical documents in that they describe
domain knowledge, but they express this content very differently, in formal lan-
guages like OWL designed for use by machines, not people. During the last
decade, interest has grown in the task of mapping from OWL to controlled frag-
ments of natural language, thus providing a niche for NLG in which we are at
last agreed on the formal specification of the input.
The aim of the talk is to compare ontologies and their textual counterparts
(e.g., technical dictionaries, encyclopedias) at several linguistic levels. After look-
ing at their usage (pragmatic level), we will consider terminology (roughly, word
level), statements (sentence level), and groups of related statements (discourse
level). The question is whether we can find similar levels in the organisation of
OWL ontologies, thus allowing a mapping from ontologies to texts that can be
exploited by NLG systems.
Bio: Richard Power has a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Sheffield,
and a PhD from the University of Edinburgh for research on generating con-
versation. From 1975-78 he worked as a postdoc at the University of Sussex,
on topics including automatic learning of numeral systems. He then moved to
Padua, Italy, where he taught English in the Psychology department for some
years, and worked as chief scientist and knowledge engineer for a Milan-based
Artificial Intelligence company. In 1993 he returned to the UK and joined the
Information Technology Research Centre at the University of Brighton. Since
2005 he has been senior lecturer in the Department of Computing at the Open
University.
His research interests since 1993 have focussed on two areas in NLG: ap-
plications of Constraint Logic Programming (especially in the ICONOCLAST
project), and natural language tools for knowledge editing (the WYSIWYM
systems). He is currently working on the development of NLG-based tools for
viewing and editing knowledge on the semantic web (SWAT project).

<abstract confidence="0.974559947368421">It gives us great pleasure to introduce the technical program of the Sixth International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2010), the biennial meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Natural Language Generation (SIGGEN). The INLG conference provides the premier forum for the discussion, dissemination and archiving of research and results in the field of natural language generation. Previous INLG conferences have been held in the USA, Australia, the UK and Israel. Prior to 2000, INLG meetings were held as international workshops with a history stretching back to 1983. In 2010, on behalf of SIGGEN, INLG is being co-hosted by Trinity College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology; and held in Trim Castle Hotel, Trim, Co. Meath, Ireland. The INLG 2010 programme consists of presentations of substantial, original, and previously unpublished results on all topics related to natural language generation. This year we received 50 submissions (36 full papers and 14 short from 18 countries from around the world. As in previous years, each submission was reviewed by at least three members of an international programme committee of leading researchers in the field. Based on these reviews 16 submissions were accepted as full papers and 8 as short papers (4 papers were withdrawn). The accepted papers are of the highest quality and cover all of the major aspects of natural language generation. This year, the conference programme includes two keynote speakers. Susan E. Brennan, Professor of Psychology at Stony Brook University, will speak on “Adapting Generation to Addressees: What Drives Audience Design?” and Richard Power of The Open University will present a talk entitled “Ontologies and Text: Can NLG Bridge the Gap?”. This year we are also delighted to host the 2010 Generation Challenges organised by Anja Belz, Albert Gatt and Alexander Koller. This is a part of INLG that has been growing in importance over the last number of conferences and is a great addition to the event. organising committee would like to their thanks to our invited speakers for agreeing to join us, the organisers of INLG 2008 for their enormous help, the SIGGEN board for allowing us host the conference and for their assistance, Priscilla Rasmussen at ACL and Alena Moison at TCD for handling finances, the programme committee for their dedicated work, and, most of all, the authors of all submitted papers. We have also received generous sponsorship from the Centre for Next Generation Localisation and Science Foundation Ireland for which we are extremely grateful. Finally, we would like to welcome you to Trim and hope that you have an enjoyable and inspiring visit. We will leave you with an Irish proverb in the spirit INLG: gan teanga, t´ır gan</abstract>
