<bodyText confidence="0.998404">
Results of a subjective evaluation with a
personalised conversational interface to a
Program Guide Information System are
discussed in the paper. The goal of the
work presented here is to examine whether
personalisation of a speech-enabled system
offers noticeable benefits to the users.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987541666667">
Personalisation has several meanings. In general
terms, service personalisation means that a service
is adapted to fit someone&apos;s preferences or needs. Its
ultimate goal is to offer a more preferred interac-
tion with the system, to retrieve the content faster
and/or to present the results in a preferred way.
Personalisation is especially important for mo-
bile devices with limited input and output capabili-
ties (Ruuska-Kalliokulju et al., 2001). It is also
clear that personalisation also serves as a product
differentiator: by letting users to shape their own
information and communication environment in
terms of devices, service interaction, etc. has huge
potentials. Furthermore, personalisation can pro-
vide a richer and even intimate experience. This
aspect is especially important when the desire of
self-expressions and individual preferences gain
more and more importance in today&apos;s world.
In our interest is the combination of rendering
the content and adapting presentation according to
the user&apos;s preferences. There are three important
aspects to be considered here: how to collect the
user preferences, how to render the retrieved re-
sults and how to assess users&apos; satisfaction regard-

ing the personalised interface. We decided to
collect user preferences in an explicit manner: in-
stead of context and/or user behaviour pattern de-
tection we implemented a web-based interface that
enables users to set preferences, aliases, for an ap-
plication. Rendering the retrieved results was
implemented as a ranking algorithm. Finally,
assessment of users&apos; acceptance was measured via
a set of subjective evaluation tests with a personal-
ised Program Guide Information System, accessi-
ble through a conversational interface.
The main goal of the work carried out is to pro-
vide insights to the acceptance of the personalised
interface. Our hypotheses were that users will no-
tice the difference between the personalised and
non-personalised versions, and that they will ap-
preciate the personalised version by its advantages
(e.g. faster delivery of tailored responses).
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 ex-
plains briefly the Program Guide Information Sys-
tem, the presentation and access techniques. The
personalisation method is covered by Section 3.
The aspects of the subjective evaluation and the
implemented methodology are discussed in Section
4, the achieved results and major findings are
summarised in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are
drawn and future directions are outlined.

</sectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.9035894">
The Program Guide Information System (PGIS),
developed as the Helsinki demonstrator in the
CATCH-2004 (www.catch2004.org, 2002) IST
project under the European Union&apos;s 5th Framework
Research Programme, is a telephony-based conver-

sational demo application which enables users to
query information about TV programs. The PGIS
application was developed on IBM&apos;s ViaVoiceTM
technology to provide access both in English and
Finnish languages. Two monolingual versions,
Finnish and English, were implemented, as well as
a multilingual solution where implicit language
identification was utilised (Harrikari et al., 2002).
For the personalisation tests only the monolingual
English version was used.
The NLU (Natural Language Understanding)
component of the system was based on mixed-
initiative dialogue technique and it provides means
for verification, focus shift, disambiguation, etc.
The basic functions, i.e. the semantic universe of
the domain, are listed in Table I.

2.2 The PGIS architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998790727272727">
The Program Guide Information System (PGIS)
architecture is depicted in Figure 1. The complete
PGIS system consists of three layers, namely the
User Agents, Server Side System and the Backend
System.
The User Agents layer interfaces to various in-
put/output devices, including (from left to right on
the top of Figure 1) smart handheld devices and
kiosks with multimodal capabilities, web interfaces
with GUI-only (Graphical User Interface) and tele-
phones with voice-only input/output modalities.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998472">

<bodyText confidence="0.999856575757576">
The Web Browser is a normal web-based client
(WAP Browser or HTML browser), used mainly in
the development phase to test database responses
for simulated user queries. Other utilisation might
be a kiosk implementation without voice capabili-
ties.
The Multimodal Browser is capable of rendering
multiple modalities such as voice and visual mo-
dalities utilising markup authoring languages such
as VoiceXML, WML and XHTML. The browser
framework was developed as part of the CATCH-
2004 project (www.catch2004.org, 2002). User
interface actions on a particular single-modal
browser are captured, converted to events and dis-
tributed to the other browsers participating in the
framework. A Synchronization Protocol was de-
fined which assists in distributing the events gen-
erated by each of the modality specific browser
(Kleindienst et al., 2002a &amp; 2002b). This enabled
to bring the value of each of the modalities in the
most economic way in order to offer the user a
habitable, easy-to-use interaction style. As an ear-
lier study on the Multimodal Browser by Halonen
et al. (2002) reveals, the speech modality is espe-
cially appreciated for searches, since random ac-
cess with speech allows the user to speak the item
directly instead of locating it, after a potentially
lengthy browsing, on a long list.
The conversational interface, NLU client, is im-
plemented using IBM&apos;s ViaVoiceTM and Natural
Language Understanding technology. The NLU
client of PGIS can be accessed via any telephone
(fixed or mobile) using voice-only connection.

The Server Side System provides web-based
(HTTP) access to the Backend System. It accepts a
user request, interpreted by one of the User Agents,
and in-turn it interacts with the PGIS database to
deliver the relevant results in the required format.
Once the required program details are received, the
Server Side adapts the response to the user&apos;s pref-
erences. The Server Side embeds the Multimodal
Application Framework and is deployed onto the
Web Container of a J2EE Application Server
(JBOSS).
The Backend System is deployed into the EJB
Container of the J2EE Application Server. The
Backend System supports the interpretation of the
user&apos;s request: it queries the database and delivers
the list of resulting program(s) to the Server Side
System. Physically, in our demonstration imple-
mentation the PGIS database resides in the prem-
ises of Elisa Communications and is connected to
the rest of the architecture over the Internet.
The Personalisation Module (PM) is defined in a
generic way so that it can be used for content per-
sonalisation by a set of applications. This module
is based on Java for creating, storing and maintain-
ing user preferences. The Personalisation Module
architecturally consists of several layers as de-
picted in Figure 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999526">
The Access Layer is used for registration, authenti-
cation, query and update of user profiles. The Da-
tabase Abstraction layer provides a unified way of
accessing the backend. The User Preference Profile
is broadly divided into three parts — personal data,
general preferences (which remain the same across
all applications, e.g. the user&apos;s name, mother
tongue, etc.), and service preferences that are spe-
cific to a particular application. There is a web-
based User Interface which uses the Access layer
to facilitate registration, authentication, viewing
and updating of user preferences (see Appendix B).
The communication between the PGIS Server
Side System and the Personalisation Module is
shown in Figure 3.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716722222222">
The steps involved in the personalisation of the
PGIS application are listed below:
Step 1: Initially, the user needs to register, to login
and then to set the preferences for the PGIS appli-
cation (explained below);
Step 2. When the user interacts with the PGIS ap-
plication over the phone, the user must be identi-
fied first. This can be done with the telephone
number or by explicit request of a User ID;
Step 3. The PGIS application requests the PM to
deliver the user&apos;s preferences by passing over the
User ID and the service identifier. The service
identifier tells the PM about the actual service re-
questing the information;
Step 4. The Personalisation Module checks the
access rights for the actual service and in case it is
allowed it delivers the user&apos;s preference for the ac-
tual service, now to the PGIS application.

<bodyText confidence="0.999125">
The Personalisation Module is responsible for stor-
ing the users&apos; application specific preferences. The
Personalisation Module itself does not contain
separate preferences for different User Agents,
rather the application renders the results for differ-
ent User Agents according to the common prefer-
ences.
In our paper we consider only the voice-only,
i.e. the NLU access case.

3.1 Aliases: setting preferences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998573307692308">
Once the user logged into the Personalisation
Module via a web interface (see Appendix B), sev-
eral aliases can be set. An alias is a shortcut that
gathers several program preferences under one
name. For the sake of simplicity we pre-defined
the alias names in advance as MySports, MyNews,
MyMovies, MyMusic and My Travel.
The length of the dialogue can be considerably
reduced with the aliases since they capture pre-
defined channels, program types and sub-types, as
well as the preferred viewing time. Furthermore,
having an easily memorable alias name helps the
user in the interaction with the NLU client.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991581">
3.2 Ranking: presenting results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960512142857143">
Typically, after the user made a query the PGIS
application interacts with the Backend System. It is
normal that for a quite open question like &amp;quot;What&apos;s
going on after 8pm on BBC World?&amp;quot; the system
will provide a rather long list of programs. From
this list the user has to find the relevant program
she or he is looking for. Personalisation can help in
re-ordering this long list so, that the programs
matching the user&apos;s preferences will come first. On
this way the interaction time can be reduced sig-
nificantly, since no follow-up questions are neces-
sary. The flow chart below describes the PGIS
Ranking mechanism.

</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.996968">

<bodyText confidence="0.999521">
In case the user has no preferences set, for a ques-
tion like &amp;quot;Tell me about MySports&amp;quot; the system will
fetch the data from the backend by sending a
(Type sports)request. However, if the user set the
preferences e.g. like it is indicated in Appendix B,
the system will issue the following request:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.480662">
(Channel —Eurosport BBC World) &amp;
(Type—newsIsports) &amp; (Subtype =golfhockey
football) &amp; (Time =Evening 18:00 — 24:00)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991202">
The results returned in both cases are ranked ac-
cording to the algorithm depicted above. The rank-
ing is interpreted by the NLU module and the
results presented accordingly by the text-to-speech
synthesis engine.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976603">
3.3 Modifications in the NLU client
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894">
The personalisation feature required only two
modifications in the NLU client.
In order to offer a more pleasant presentation for
a personalised answer, and to indicate to the user
that the response is according to his/her prefer-
ences, the system prompt was modified as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.5163692">
if personalisation == true
system_prompt = &amp;quot;I have found the following
preferred programs ...&amp;quot;
else
system_prompt = &amp;quot;I have found the following programs&amp;quot;
</figure>
<tableCaption confidence="0.919467">
Table II. Modification of NLU prompting.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989975">
The other change is related to the user identifica-
tion. In our particular test environment analogue
telephone cards were used thus we introduced an
extra step in the beginning of the session to request
the user to key in a four digit User ID. Although
this is not the most advanced and seamless way of
identifying the user, this served properly our test
purposes.

4.2 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952333333333">
The tests were organised with two groups of users,
in each group having 6 persons with technical
background. Four out of the 12 persons tried out an
earlier version of the PGIS application, for the rest
it was entirely unknown. None of the tests users
had English as a mother tongue.
The tests were executed in two steps for each
group. Group A first called the personalised and
then the non-personalised version, while Group B
executed the tests in the reversed order. The two
rounds for each group were organised on different
days. After each test round a web-based question-
naire was filled up by the user. Once both tests
were conducted, the users received by e-mail a fi-
nal questionnaire for comparing the two systems.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999422">
4.3 Test scenarios
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792">
Before starting the tests, each user was asked to
pick up one favourite alias and they were in-
structed to fill up the web-based personalisation
settings. The scenario, the sequence of queries to
conduct with the system, is described in Appendix
C. The very same scenario was given to all users in
both rounds of the test.

Conversational interfaces, utilising Natural Lan-
guage Understanding and dialogue technology, are
gradually becoming mature enough to serve in lar-
ger deployments. Our attempt to use such technol-
ogy for the Program Guide Information System is
justified by the achieved objective results as shown
below.

<bodyText confidence="0.833498555555556">
Looking into these results one must take into con-
siderations the following issues:
1. The call success rate was 100%, each test per-
son could conduct the session successfully;
2. There were more than one task per call, since
often test users asked additional information
(e.g. about director, duration of program, etc.).
In our case task and concept understanding ac-
curacy are almost identical since due to the
given scenario a task consisted of only one se-
mantic unit;
3. Although the word error rate is relatively high,
one must remember that this is a conversational
system with a middle size vocabulary including
ca. 7000 words. Errors in the recognition often
occur for words irrelevant from the understand-
ing point of view;
4. The word error rate in the April 2002 monolin-
gual tests were 28.62%. Compared to those re-
sult the word error rate is lower now (24.25%)
due to shorter sessions with a rather limited test
scenario (the acoustic models were not updated
after April 2002);
5. The task success rate was higher for the person-
alised system, which partly can be explained by
the fact that the sessions with this version were
shorter by almost 30% (4.81 queries vs. 6.77).

After each call the users immediately filled up a
questionnaire. There we asked how they liked the
just tested system, how they felt about learnability,
how fast/easily they got the requested answer and
how they perceived the understanding capabilities
of the system. The results for the two groups are
presented below:

Table IV. Questionnaire results for the two
groups: means for each group for different
usability aspects. NB.: for Group A the 1st
system was the personalised one, for Group
B the 2&apos; one (the shaded areas).
What can we see here? An intra-group comparison
reveals that there is no significant difference be-
tween the 1St and 2nd system results in both test
groups. However, it can be noticed that in Group A
the average scores for the 2nd system (non-
personalised one) are remained the same or lower
than for the rt personalised system. An opposite
trend is noticeable for Group B, where the presen-
tation of the systems were in reversed order and
the scores are remained the same or increased. The
only aspect which do not fit to this trend is Under-
standing for Group A. The average score increased
from 3.17 to 4.17 and it suggests some kind of
learning effect, i.e. for the second run the users
accepted and learned the capabilities of the system,
they gained some practice, talked more clearly,
managed to perform a better interaction and thus
detected a better understanding by the system.
Group B preferred the latter tested personalised
system over the non-personalised one more than
Group A preferred the first tested system, thus
there is a relevance in which order the users exe-
cuted the tasks. Under this basis we can say that
our 4th hypothesis holds and the appreciation of the
personalised system, according to the 1st hypothe-
sis, is also valid (although not in significant terms).
The increasing and decreasing trends for both
groups hints that the users set their absolute level
of judgment by the first round of tests. It is reason-
able to think that the novelty of the systems was
important in the first test round and users scored
somehow on an absolute level. In the second round
their scoring was already relatively scaled to the
experience of the first round.

5.3 Comparative evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992066466666667">
After the second test round the users immediately
filled up the after-call evaluation questionnaire.
Later, the same day, they received by e-mail a
questionnaire to compare the two systems. The
result of the comparative analysis revealed the fol-
lowing major findings:
1. The speed of the personalised system is appre-
ciated, especially by Group B which first evalu-
ated the non-personalised version. Clearly, the
non-personalised system, i.e. the order of test,
had an effect on them. 58.3% of all users con-
sidered the personalised version faster. 83.3%
of Group B answered that the personalised sys-
tem was faster, while only 33.3% of Group A
users judged the personalised system faster;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9919434">
2. Delivering the correct and desired answer by
the personalised system is appreciated in only
41.7% of all answers;
3. Difference in preference is also noticeable.
66.7% of users in Group A preferred in general
the non-personalised system while 66.7% of
Group B users preferred in general the person-
alised system. This is most probably due to the
order how the systems were presented to the
test users. Another reason might be a sort of
learning effect, since both groups preferred the
systems that they tested in the second round;
4. A similar trend is present for the aspect of an-
swer quality: while 2/3 in Group A considered
the non-personalised system higher quality the

same amount stated similarly in Group B about
the personalised system;
5. Every fourth user considered the non-
personalised system friendlier than the person-
alised one. One explanation can be that the per-
sonalised system was faster and it provided
shorter program lists in the answers. Probably
this &amp;quot;to-the-point&amp;quot; strategy was considered as a
somehow unfriendly approach.

6 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934822777777778">
The five hypotheses set before the tests were
mostly justified, however, some can hold only with
some modifications. Below there is a summary of
the achieved results grouped according to the hy-
potheses.
1. &amp;quot;Subjects will notice the difference in the op-
eration of the personalised and non-
personalised systems.&amp;quot; - Yes, the users noticed
the differences, especially in Group A (users
who tested first the personalised system) 83.3%
of the users reported noticeable differences
(e.g. speed). 66.7% reported larger amount of
programs presented by one of the systems (the
non-personalised one, but it was not revealed to
them). In overall, 66.7% of all test persons
(both Group A and B) reported noticeable dif-
ferences.
2. &amp;quot;Test users will appreciate the advantages of=
fered by personalisation.&amp;quot; — Two third of the
users in Group A preferred in general the non-
personalised system while a similar portion of
Group B test users preferred the personalised
system. A similar trend was detected when the
quality of the systems was questioned. We can
thus conclude that test users appreciate the ad-
vantages offered by the personalised version if
they are already familiar with the non-
personalised version. Thus our hypothesis
should be modified as: &amp;quot;Personalisation will be
appreciated if the user is already familiar with a
similar system&amp;quot;.
3. &amp;quot;The aspects that will be appreciated most will
be easiness, accelerated interaction and deliv-
ering the correct and desired answer.&amp;quot; — This
hypothesis holds only partly. The users did not
rate easiness similarly within the two groups:
both groups found the second system easier to
use (personalised one for Group B). When the
delivery of the correct answer was asked, only
41.7% of all users&apos; appreciated the responses of
the personalised system — this is not what we
expected. However, regarding speed both
groups favoured the personalised system. In
overall, 58.3% of all users considered the per-
sonalised system faster.

<listItem confidence="0.71832575">
4. &amp;quot;Users who experiment first the non-
personalised system and only after that the
personalised system will appreciate more the
advantages of the personalised system, com-
pared to those users who experiment in the re-
versed order.&amp;quot; — This hypothesis turned out to
be entirely valid as it was discussed in the case
of the 2nd hypothesis.
5. &amp;quot;Users are ready to use a personalised PGIS
and a web-based preference setting is accept-
able.&amp;quot; — As the feedback analysis revealed,
90,9% of the users who watch TV would be

ready to fetch at least some program informa-
tion from the personalised PGIS system. Al-
though web-based setting is acceptable (score
given 4.25), more automation would also be a
useful feature, especially Group A indicated so.

7 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998496">
Answering the question in the title of the paper, we
conclude that efficient interaction can be imple-
mented using personalisation. Personalisation
brings benefits to the user: faster interaction is
clearly the most appreciated feature. However,
when the correctness of answers are considered,
further work is needed to improve the acceptance
of a personalised implementation.
Speech technology is mature enough and its
benefits are recognised by the user. Flexible inter-
action can be offered by Natural Language Under-
standing based technology.
Future work will utilise the know-how devel-
oped in the project and the findings of the here pre-
sented personalisation tests.

Appendix C. The test scenario
1. Ask for your preferred programs (e.g.
&amp;quot;Tell me about MyMovies.&amp;quot;);
2. Act as the system instructs you (e.g.
specify day or time, give further crite-
ria);
3. Once a list of programs is given by the
system, ask for a description of the
first program in the list;
4. When asked whether the system
should send you the program details in
a short message. say that you do not
want it (use natural expressions);
5. End the session and hang up.
Appendix A. An example natural language
dialogue (non-personalised PG IS application)

tween 6 pm and 12 pm: It&apos;s Always Fair Weather, The
Murder Men, Boom Town, and The Hook.
U: What time is the first one?
S: It&apos;s Always Fair Weather starts at 5 past 5 pm. How else
can I help you?
U: How long does it last?
S: It&apos;s Always Fair Weather lasts 1 hours 40 minutes. What
information can I offer you next?
U: Who are the actors?
S: The actors are Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd,
Cyd Charisse. How else can I help you?
U: Can I have a description for it please?
S: I can offer you the following type of description: The un-
beatable musical team of Kelly and Donen is behind this
happy musical about three serviceman buddies reunited
after 10 years What else can I do for you?
U: That&apos;s all for now Good-bye.
S: Thank you for using the Program Guide. Good-bye.

The PGIS application was developed on IBM&apos;s ViaVoiceTM technology to provide access both in English and Finnish languages. Two monolingual versions, Finnish and English, were implemented, as well as a multilingual solution where implicit language identification was utilised (Harrikari et al., 2002). For the personalisation tests only the monolingual English version was used. The NLU (Natural Language Understanding) component of the system was based on mixedinitiative dialogue technique and it provides means for verification, focus shift, disambiguation, etc. The basic functions, i.e. the semantic universe of the domain, are listed in Table I. • Program name • Program type (music, movie, news, etc.) • Channel (BBC World, CNN, TCM, Eurosport) • Performer • Date • Time • Language • Other: starting and ending time, duration, country of origin, episode title, short description, possible re-r</context>

User interface actions on a particular single-modal browser are captured, converted to events and distributed to the other browsers participating in the framework. A Synchronization Protocol was defined which assists in distributing the events generated by each of the modality specific browser (Kleindienst et al., 2002a &amp; 2002b). This enabled to bring the value of each of the modalities in the most economic way in order to offer the user a habitable, easy-to-use interaction style. As an earlier study on the Multimodal Browser by Halonen et al. (2002) reveals, the speech modality is especially appreciated for searches, since random access with speech allows the user to speak the item directly instead of locating it, after a potentially lengthy browsing, on a long list. The conversational interface, NLU client, is implemented using IBM&apos;s ViaVoiceTM and Natural Language Understanding technology. The NLU client of PGIS can be accessed via any telephone (fixed or mobile) using voice-only connection.
