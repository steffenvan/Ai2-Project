<bodyText confidence="0.999877625">
In order to represent speech acts, in a
multi-agent context, we choose a knowledge
representation based on the modal logic of
knowledge KT4 which is defined by Sato. Such
a formalism allows us to reason about know-
ledge and represent knowledge about knowled-
ge, the notions of truth value and of defi-
nite reference.

I INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584546511628">
Speech act representation and the lan-
guage planning require that the system can
reason about intensional concepts like know-
ledge and belief. A problem resolver must
understand the concept of knowledge and know
for example what knowledge it needs to achie-
ve specific goals. Our assumption is that a
theory of lanvage is part of a theory of ac-
tion (Austin L4] ).
Reasoning about knowledge encounters the
problem of intensionality. One aspect of this
problem is the indirect reference introduced
by Frege 1-71 during the last century. Mc Car-
thy [15] presents this problem by giving the
following example :
Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike&apos;s tele-
phone number (1)
and Pat dialled Mike&apos;s te-
lephone number (2)
The meaning of the proposition &amp;quot;Mike&apos;s tele-
phone number&amp;quot; in (1) is the concept of the
telephone number, whereas its meaning in (2)
is the number itself.
Then if we have : &amp;quot;Mary&apos;s telephone number
= Mike&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot;,
we can deduce that :
&amp;quot;Pat dialled Mary&apos;s tele-
phone number&amp;quot;
but we cannot deduce that :
&amp;quot;Pat knows Mary&apos;s telephone
number&amp;quot;,
because Pat may not have known the equality
mentioned above.
Thus there are verbs like &amp;quot;to know&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to
believe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to want&amp;quot; that create an &amp;quot;opaque&amp;quot;
context. For Frege a sentence is a name, refe-
rence of a sentence is its truth value,
the sense of a sentence is the proposi-
tion. In an oblique context, the refe-
rence becomes the proposition. For exam-
ple the referent of the sentence p in the
indirect context &amp;quot;A knows that p&amp;quot; is a
proposition and no longer a truth value.
Mc Carthy [15] and Konolige [11]
have adopted Frege&apos;s approach. They consi-
der the concepts like objects of a first-
order language. Thus one term will denote
Mike&apos;s telephone number and another will
denote the concept of Mike&apos;s telephone
number. The problem of replacing equalities
by equalities is then avoided because the
concept of Mike&apos;s telephone number and the
number itself are different entities.
Mc Carthy&apos;s distinction concept/object
corresponds to Frege&apos;s sense/reference or
to modern logicians&apos; intension/extension.
Maida and Shapiro [13] adopt the same
approach but use propositional semantic
networks that are labelled graphs, and that
only represent intensions and not exten-
sions, that is to say individual concepts
and propositions and not referents and
truth values, We bear in mind that a seman-
tic network is a graph whose nodes repre-
sent individuals and whose oriented arcs
represent binary relations.
Cohen [6], being interested in speech
act planning, proposes the formalism of
partitioned semantic networks as data base
to represent an agent&apos;s beliefs. A parti-
tioned semantic network is a labelled graph
whose nodes and arcs are distributed into
spaces. Every node or space is identified
by its own label. Hendrix [§] introduced
it to represent the situations requiring
the delimitation of information sub-sets.
In this way Cohen succeeds in avoiding the
problems raised by the data base approach.
These problems are clearly identified by
Moore F17,181. For example to represent
&apos;A does not believe P&apos;, Cohen asserts
Believe (A,P) in a global data base, en-
tirely separated from any agent&apos;s know-
ledge base. But as Appelt 172] notes, this
solution raised problems when one needs to
combine facts from a particular data base
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998096">
194
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997297018518519">
with global facts to prove a single assertion.
For example, from the assertion :
4, know (John,Q) &amp;know (John,P .7.)Q)
where PD Q is in John&apos;s data base and 4, know
(John,Q) is in the global data base, it should
be possible to conclude 4, know (John,?) but
a good strategy must be found !
In a nutshell, in this first approach
which we will call a syntactical one, an a-
gent&apos;s beliefs are identified with formulas
in a first-order language, and propositional
attitudes are modelled as relations between
an agent and a formula in the object langua-
ge, but Montague showed that modalities can-
not consistently be treated as predicates ap-
plying to nouns of propositions.
The other approach no longer considers
the intension as an object but as a function
from possible worlds to entities. For ins-
tance the intension of a predicate P is the
function which to each possible world W (or
more generally a point of reference, see
Scott [23] ) associates the extension of P
in W.
This approach is the one that Moore
[17,18] adopted. He gave a first-order axio-
matization of Kripke&apos;s possible worlds seman-
tics [12] for Hintikka&apos;s modal logic of know-
ledge [10].
The fundamental assumption that makes
this translation possible, is that an attri-
bution of any propositional attitude like
&amp;quot;to know&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to believe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to remember&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to
strive&amp;quot; entails a division of the set of pos-
sible worlds into two classes : the possible
worlds that go with the propositional attitu-
de that is considered, and those that are in-
compatible with it. Thus &amp;quot;A knows that P&amp;quot; is
equivalent to &amp;quot;P is true in every world com-
patible with what A knows&amp;quot;.
We think that possible worlds language
is complicated and unintuitive, since, rather
than reasoning directly about facts that some-
one knows, we reason about the possible worlds
compatible with what he knows. This transla-
tion also presents some problems for the plan-
ning. For instance to establish that A knows
that P, we must make P true in every world
which is compatible with A&apos;s knowledge. This
set of worlds is a potentially infinite set.
The most important advantage of
Moore&apos;s approach [17,18] is that it gives
a smart axiomatization of the interaction
between knowledge and action.

II PRESENTATION OF OUR APPROACH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988851296296296">
Our approach is comprised in the general
framework of the second approach, but in-
stead of encoding Hintikka&apos;s modal logic
of knowledge in a first-order language,
we consider the logic of knowledge propo-
sed by Mc Carthy, the decidability of
which was proved by Sato [21] and we pro-
pose a prover of this logic, based on na-
tural deduction.
We bear in mind that the idea of u-
sing the modal logic of knowledge in A.I.
was proposed for the first time by Mc Car-
thy and Hayes [14].
A. Languages
A language L is a triple (Pr,Sp,T)
where :
.Pr is the set of propositional va-
riables,
.Sp is the set of persons,
.T is the set of positive integers.
The language of classical proposi-
tional calculus is L = (Pr,t6,64). SoEISp
will also be denoted by 0 and will be
called &amp;quot;FOOL&amp;quot;.
B. Well Formed Formulas
The set of well formed formulas is
defined to be the least set Wff such as :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9816955">
(W1) Pr C Wff
(W2) a ,b E Wff implies aDbe Wff
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.849227444444444">
(W3) SE.Sp,t E_T,aEWff implies(St)acWff
The symbol D denotes &amp;quot;implication&amp;quot;.
(St)a means &amp;quot;S knows a at time t&amp;quot;
&lt;St&gt;a (= 4, (St) 4, a) means &amp;quot;a is pos-
sible for S at
time t&amp;quot;.
{Sas (= (St)a V (St) 4, a) means
&amp;quot;S knows whether
a at time t&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994395">

<bodyText confidence="0.9114765">
C. Hilbert-type System KT4
The axiom schemata for KT4 are :

<listItem confidence="0.891019444444444">
Al. Axioms of ordinary propositional lo-
gic
A2. (St)a -D a

A6. If a is an axiom, then (St)a is an
axiom.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995568583333333">
Now, we give the meaning of axioms :
(A2) says that what is known is true, that
is to say that it is impossible to have
false knowledge. If P is false, we cannot
say : &amp;quot;John knows that P&amp;quot; but we can say
&amp;quot;John believes that V&apos;. This axiom is the
main difference between knowledge and be-
lief.
This distinction is important for plan-
ning because when an agent achieves his goals,
the beliefs on which he bases his actions must
generally be true.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948620222222222">
(A3) says that what FOOL knows at time t,
FOOL knows at time t that anyone knows
it at time t. FOOL&apos;s knowledge represents
universal knowledge, that is to say all
agents knowledge.
(A4) says that what is known will remain
true and that every agent can apply modus
ponens, that is, he knows all the logical
consequences of his knowledge.
(A5) says that if someone knows something
then he knows that he knows it. This a-
xiom is often required to reason about
plans composed of several steps. It will
be referred to as the positive introspec-
tive axiom.
(A6) is the rule of inference.
D. Representation of the notion of truth va-
lue.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992744333333334">
We give a great importance to the repre-
sentation of the notion of truth value of a
proposition, for example the utterance :
John knows whether he is taller than
Bill (1)
can be considered as an assertion that mentions
the truth value of the proposition P = John is
taller than Bill, without taking a position as
to whether the latter is true or false.
In our formalism (1) is represented
by :
{John} P
This disjunctive solution is also adopted
by Allen and Perrault [1]. Maida and Sha-
piro [13] represent this notion by a node
because the truth value is a concept (an
object of thought).
The representation of the notion of
truth value is useful to plan questions :
A speaker can ask a hearer whether a cer-
tain proposition is true, if the latter
knows whether this proposition is true.
E. Representing definite descriptions in
conversational systems :
Let us consider a dialogue between
two participants : A speaker S and a hea-
rer H. The language is then reduced to :
Sp = (0,H,S} and T = {IT
Let P stand for the proposition : &amp;quot;The
description D in the context C is unique-
ly satisfied by E&amp;quot;.
Clark and Marshall [51 give examples that
show that for S to refer to H to some en-
tity E using some description D in a con-
text C, it is sufficient that P is a mu-
tual knowledge; this condition is tanta-
mount to (0)P is provable. Perrault and
Cohen [20] show that this condition is
too strong. They claim that an infinite
number of conjuncts are necessary for suc-
cessful reference :
(S) P&amp; (S)(H) P&amp; (S)(H)(S) P &amp;
with only a finite number of false conjuncts.
Finally, Nadathur and Joshi [19] give the
following expression as sufficient condition
for using D to refer to E :
(s) s)(s)(H) P &amp; 4 ((s) B.D(S)%(0)P)
where B is the conjunction of the set of
sentences that form the core knowledge of
S and 1- is the inference symbole.

IV DECISION PROCEDURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997865692307692">
A logical axiom is a formula of the
form F[P+,P-1. A proof is an single-roo-
ted tree of formulas all of whose leaves
are logical axioms. It is grown upwards
from the root, the rules (R1), (R2) and
(R3) must be applied in a reverse sense.
These reversal rules will be used as
&amp;quot;production rules&amp;quot;. The meaning of each
production expressed in terms of the pro-
gramming language PROLOG is an implication.
It can be shown [241 that the following
strategy is a complete proof procedure :
. The formula to prove is at the star-

priority , followed by the rule (R2), then
by the rule (R3).
The choice of the rule to apply can be
done intelligently. In general, the choice of
(RI) then (R2) increases the likelihood to
find a proof because these (reversal) rules
give more complex formulas. In the case where
(R3) does not lead to a loss of formulas, it
is more efficient to choose it at first. The
following example is given to illustrate this
strategy :
Example
Take (A4) as an example and let Fo deno-
tes its equivalent version in our language
(Fo is at the start node) :
Fo = &amp;quot;(St)( %a V b) v % (Su)a V (Su)b where

<equation confidence="0.974427666666667">
P+ = {(St)( % a V b), %(Su)a,(Su)b};
p {(St)( % a V b),(Su)a};
By (R3) we have (no losses of formulas) :
F1 = %(St)( % a V b) V %(Su)a V b
P+ = {%(St)(% a V b), %(Su)a,b}
p- = {(St)(&apos; a V b),(Su)al
By (i2) we have :
F = F V %(%a V b)
= PI U {%(%a V b)}

P- = P- U• {%a V b}

A problem resolver must understand the concept of knowledge and know for example what knowledge it needs to achieve specific goals. Our assumption is that a theory of lanvage is part of a theory of action (Austin L4] ). Reasoning about knowledge encounters the problem of intensionality. One aspect of this problem is the indirect reference introduced by Frege 1-71 during the last century. Mc Carthy [15] presents this problem by giving the following example : Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike&apos;s telephone number (1) and Pat dialled Mike&apos;s telephone number (2) The meaning of the proposition &amp;quot;Mike&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot; in (1) is the concept of the telephone number, whereas its meaning in (2) is the number itself. Then if we have : &amp;quot;Mary&apos;s telephone number = Mike&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot;, we can deduce that : &amp;quot;Pat dialled Mary&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot; but we cannot deduce that : &amp;quot;Pat knows Mary&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot;, because Pat may not have known the equality mentioned above. Thus there are verbs like &amp;quot;to know&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to believe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to want&amp;quot; that create an &amp;quot;opaque&amp;quot; context.

I INTRODUCTION Speech act representation and the language planning require that the system can reason about intensional concepts like knowledge and belief. A problem resolver must understand the concept of knowledge and know for example what knowledge it needs to achieve specific goals. Our assumption is that a theory of lanvage is part of a theory of action (Austin L4] ). Reasoning about knowledge encounters the problem of intensionality. One aspect of this problem is the indirect reference introduced by Frege 1-71 during the last century. Mc Carthy [15] presents this problem by giving the following example : Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike&apos;s telephone number (1) and Pat dialled Mike&apos;s telephone number (2) The meaning of the proposition &amp;quot;Mike&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot; in (1) is the concept of the telephone number, whereas its meaning in (2) is the number itself. Then if we have : &amp;quot;Mary&apos;s telephone number = Mike&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot;, we can deduce that : &amp;quot;Pat dialled Mary&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot; but we cannot deduce that : &amp;quot;Pat knows Mary&apos;s telephone number&amp;quot;, because Pat may not have known the equality mentioned above.

This set of worlds is a potentially infinite set. The most important advantage of Moore&apos;s approach [17,18] is that it gives a smart axiomatization of the interaction between knowledge and action. II PRESENTATION OF OUR APPROACH Our approach is comprised in the general framework of the second approach, but instead of encoding Hintikka&apos;s modal logic of knowledge in a first-order language, we consider the logic of knowledge proposed by Mc Carthy, the decidability of which was proved by Sato [21] and we propose a prover of this logic, based on natural deduction. We bear in mind that the idea of using the modal logic of knowledge in A.I. was proposed for the first time by Mc Carthy and Hayes [14]. A. Languages A language L is a triple (Pr,Sp,T) where : .Pr is the set of propositional variables, .Sp is the set of persons, .T is the set of positive integers. The language of classical propositional calculus is L = (Pr,t6,64). SoEISp will also be denoted by 0 and will be called &amp;quot;FOOL&amp;quot;. B. Well Formed Formulas The set of well formed formulas is defined to be the least set Wff such as : (W1)</context>

The other approach no longer considers the intension as an object but as a function from possible worlds to entities. For instance the intension of a predicate P is the function which to each possible world W (or more generally a point of reference, see Scott [23] ) associates the extension of P in W. This approach is the one that Moore [17,18] adopted. He gave a first-order axiomatization of Kripke&apos;s possible worlds semantics [12] for Hintikka&apos;s modal logic of knowledge [10]. The fundamental assumption that makes this translation possible, is that an attribution of any propositional attitude like &amp;quot;to know&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to believe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to remember&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to strive&amp;quot; entails a division of the set of possible worlds into two classes : the possible worlds that go with the propositional attitude that is considered, and those that are incompatible with it.
