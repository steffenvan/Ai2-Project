<bodyText confidence="0.99995275">
A defining symptom of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) is the presence of re-
stricted and repetitive activities and inter-
ests, which can surface in language as a
perseverative focus on idiosyncratic top-
ics. In this paper, we use semantic sim-
ilarity measures to identify such idiosyn-
cratic topics in narratives produced by
children with and without ASD. We find
that neurotypical children tend to use the
same words and semantic concepts when
retelling the same narrative, while chil-
dren with ASD, even when producing ac-
curate retellings, use different words and
concepts relative not only to neurotypical
children but also to other children with
ASD. Our results indicate that children
with ASD not only stray from the target
topic but do so in idiosyncratic ways ac-
cording to their own restricted interests.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999968018867924">
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurode-
velopmental disorder characterized by impaired
communication and social behavior. One of the
core symptoms is a preoccupation with specific re-
stricted interests (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2013), and several commonly used diagnos-
tic instruments for ASD instruct examiners to eval-
uate the degree to which subjects display this char-
acteristic (Lord et al., 2002; Rutter et al., 2003).
In verbal individuals with ASD, such a preoccu-
pation can be expressed as a tendency to fixate on
a particular idiosyncratic topic.
Previous research relying on expert annota-
tion of spoken language in children with ASD
has found that their spoken narratives and con-
versations include significantly more instances
of irrelevant content and more topic digressions
(Loveland et al., 1990; Losh and Capps, 2003;
Lam et al., 2012). Similar results at the lexical
level have been reported using automated anno-
tations (Prud’hommeaux and Rouhizadeh, 2012;
Rouhizadeh et al., 2013). There has been little
work, however, in characterizing the precise direc-
tion of the departure from a target topic, leaving
open the question of whether children with ASD
are instigating similar, potentially reasonable topic
changes or whether they are introducing idiosyn-
cratic topics consistent with their own restricted
interests.
In this paper, we attempt to automatically iden-
tify topic digressions in the narrative retellings
of children with ASD and to determine whether
these digressions are influenced by their idiosyn-
cratic or restricted interests. From a corpus of
spoken retellings of the same brief narrative, we
extract several measures designed to capture dif-
ferent facets of semantic similarity between a pair
of retellings. We find that the retellings of chil-
dren with typical development (TD) semantically
resemble one another much more than they resem-
ble retellings by children with ASD. This indicates
that TD children are adhering to a common tar-
get topic, while children with ASD are introduc-
ing topic changes. More strikingly, the similar-
ity between pairs of ASD retellings is even lower,
suggesting that children with ASD are straying
from the target topic in individual and idiosyn-
cratic ways. Although we do not yet have manual
annotations to confirm that these topic shifts corre-
spond to the particular restricted interests of each
study participant, our methods and results show
the potential of using automated analysis for re-
vealing diagnostically relevant linguistic features.

Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Short Papers), pages 212–217,
Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. c�2015 Association for Computational Linguistics
ranging in age from 4 to 9 years, participated
in this study. ASD was diagnosed via clinical
consensus according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and the
established thresholds on two widely-used diag-
nostic instruments: the Autism Diagnostic Obser-
vation Schedule (Lord et al., 2002) and the So-
cial Communication Questionnaire (Rutter et al.,
2003). No children met the criteria for a lan-
guage impairment, and there were no significant
between-group differences in age or full-scale IQ.
To elicit retellings, we used the Narrative Mem-
ory subtest of the NEPSY (Korkman et al., 1998),
a large battery of tasks testing neurocognitive
functioning in children. In the NEPSY Narrative
Memory (NNM) subtest, the subject listens to a
brief narrative about a boy and his dog and then
must retell the narrative to the examiner. Figure 1
shows two sample retellings from our corpus. The
NNM was administered by a trained clinician
to each study participant, and each participant’s
retelling was recorded, transcribed, and evaluated
according to the published scoring guidelines.
Under standard administration of the NNM, a
retelling is scored according to how many story
elements from a predetermined list it contains.
The guidelines for scoring do not require verba-
tim recall for most elements and generally allow
the use of synonyms and paraphrases. As is typ-
ically reported when comparing matched groups
(Diehl et al., 2006), we observed no significant
difference in the standard NNM free recall score
between the TD group (mean = 6.25, sd = 3.43)
and the ASD group (mean = 4.90, sd = 3.72). It
might seem that a low similarity score between
two retellings simply indicates that one retelling
includes fewer story elements. However, given the
equivalent number of story elements recalled by
the two groups, we can assume that a low similar-
ity score indicates a difference in the quality rather
than the quantity of information in the retellings.

3 Semantic similarity measures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987529411765">
We expect that two different retellings of the same
narrative will lie in the same lexico-semantic space
and will thus have high similarity scores. In this
work we use well-known similarity measures with
two modifications. Children with autism tend to
use more off-topic and unexpected words. Such
words always have high inverse document fre-
quency (IDF) scores since they are very specific to
a particular retelling. By including IDF weights,
a similarity measure would be biased toward off-
topic words rather than actual content words in
the story elements. Conventional IDF weights are
therefore not useful for our particular purpose. In-
stead, we remove closed-class function words to
avoid their bias in our similarity measures. In ad-
dition, we lemmatize our narrative corpus to re-
duce the sparsity due to inflectional variation.

size of intersection of the words in narratives n and
m, relative to the size of word union of n and m:

Cosine similarity score SimCos is the similarity
between two narratives by cosine of the angle be-

identifying plagiarism at the document level. This
measure normalizes the frequency of the words

all length of the two narratives, as well as the rel-
ative frequency of the words common to the two
narratives. We used a simplified variation of this

BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is commonly used
measure of n-gram overlap for automatically eval-
uating machine translation output. Because it is a
precision metric, the BLEU score for any pair of
narratives n and m will depend on which narrative
is considered the “reference”. To create a single
BLEU-based overlap score for each pair of narra-
tives, we calculate SimBLEU(n,m) as the mean of
BLEU(m, n) and BLEU(n, m).

It is reasonable to expect people to use syn-
onyms or semantically similar words in their nar-
ratives retellings. It is therefore possible that chil-
dren with autism are discussing the appropriate
topic but choosing unusual words within that topic
space in their retellings. We therefore use a set of
measures that consider the semantic overlap of two
narratives using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sim-
ilarities (Achananuparp et al., 2008), in order to
distinguish instances of atypical but semantically
appropriate language from true examples of poor
topic maintenance. Because WordNet-based simi-
larity measures only consider word pairs with the
same part-of-speech, we POS-tagged the data us-
ing a perceptron tagger (Yarmohammadi, 2014).

<bodyText confidence="0.995866333333333">
In a modified version ofWordNet-based vector
similarity, SimWV ), (Li et al., 2006), we first cre-
ate vectors vn and vm for each narrative n and m,
where each element corresponds to a word in the

element e in vn using the following formulation:

where LS is Lin’s universal similarity (Lin, 1998).
In other words, if the element e is present in n,
S(e, n) will be 1. If not, the most similar word
to e will be chosen from words in n using Lin’s
universal similarity and S(e, n) will be that maxi-
mum score. The same procedure is applied to vm,
and finally the similarity score between n and m is
derived from the cosine score between vn and vm.

For each of the semantic similarity measures, we
build a similarity matrix comparing every possi-
ble pair of children. Because this pairwise simi-
larity matrix is diagonally symmetrical, we need
only consider the top right section of the matrix
above the diagonal in our analyses. Table 1 shows
the mean semantic overlap scores between the nar-
ratives for each of the three sub-matrices described
above. We see that for both the word-overlap
and the knowledge-based semantic similarity mea-
sures described in Section 3, TD children are most
similar to other TD children. ASD children are
less similar to TD children than TD children are to
one another; and children with ASD are even less
similar to other ASD children than to TD children.
Our goal is to explore the degree of similar-
ity, as measured by the semantic overlap mea-
sures, within and across diagnostic groups. With
this in mind, we consider the following three
sub-matrices for each similarity matrix: one in
which each TD child is compared with every other

each ASD child is compared with every other
ASD child (the ASD.ASD sub-matrix); and one in
which each child is compared with the children in
the diagnostic group to which he does not belong
(the TD.ASD sub-matrix).
Note that we have no a priori reason to assume
that the similarity scores are from any particu-
lar distribution. In order to calculate the statis-
tical significance of these between-group differ-
ences, we therefore apply a Monte Carlo permu-
tation method, a non-parametric procedure com-
monly used in non-standard significance testing
situations. For each pair of sub-matrices (e.g.,
TD.TD vs ASD.ASD) we calculate two statistics
that compare the cells in one sub-matrix with the
cells in other sub-matrices: the t-statistic, using
the Welch Two Sample t-test; and the w-statistic,
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We next take
a large random sample with replacement from all
possible permutations of the data by shuffling the
diagnosis labels of the children 1000 times. We
then calculate two above statistics for each shuffle
and count the number of times the observed values
exceed the values produced by the 1000 shuffles.
Applying the Monte Carlo permutation method,
we calculate the statistical significance of the
following comparisons: TD.TD vs ASD.ASD;
TD.TD vs TD.ASD; and TD.ASD vs ASD.ASD.
Table 2 summarizes the results of these signifi-
cance tests. In all cases, the differences are signif-
icant at p &lt; 0.05 except for the first two compar-
isons in the t-test permutation of SimRF, which
narrowly eluded significance.

5 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894125">
High-functioning children with ASD have long
been described as “little professors”, using pedan-
tic or overly-adult language (Asperger, 1944).
Low lexical overlap similarity measures by them-
selves might indicate that children with ASD are
using semantically appropriate but infrequent or
sophisticated words that were not used by other
children. We note, however, that the knowledge-
based overlap measures follow the same pattern
as the purely lexical overlap measures. This sug-
gests that it not the case that children with ASD
are simply using rare synonyms of the more com-
mon words used by TD children. Instead, it seems
that the children with ASD are moving away from
the target topic and following their own individual
and idiosyncratic semantic paths. These findings
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997455">
215
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991857142857">
provide additional quantitative evidence not only
for the common qualitative observation that young
children with ASD have difficulty with topic main-
tenance but also for the more general behavioral
symptom of idiosyncratic and restricted interests.
The overlap measures presented in this paper
could be used as features for machine learning
classification of ASD in combination with other
linguistic features we have explored, including the
use of off-topic lexical items (Rouhizadeh et al.,
2013), features associated with poor pragmatic
competence (Prud’hommeaux et al., 2014), and
repetitive language measures (van Santen et al.,
2013). Recall, however, that a clinician must con-
sider a wide range of social, communication, and
behavioral criteria when making a diagnosis of
ASD, making it unlikely that language features
alone could perfectly predict a diagnosis of ASD.
The more significant potential in our approaches
is more likely to lie in the area of language deficit
detection and remediation.
A focus of our future work will be to manually
annotate the data to determine the frequency and
nature of the topic excursions. It is our expecta-
tion that children with ASD do not only veer from
the target topic more frequently than typically de-
veloping children but also pursue topics of their
own individual specific interests. We also plan to
apply our methods to ASR output rather than man-
ual transcripts. Despite the high word error rates
typically observed with this sort of audio data, we
anticipate that our methods, which rely primarily
on content words, will be relatively robust.
The work presented here demonstrates the util-
ity of applying automated analysis methods to spo-
ken language collected in a clinical settings for
diagnostic and remedial purposes. Carefully de-
signed tools using such methods could provide
helpful information not only to clinicians and ther-
apists working with children with ASD but also
to researchers exploring the specific linguistic and
behavioral deficits associated with ASD.

<abstract confidence="0.996957952380953">A defining symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the presence of restricted and repetitive activities and interests, which can surface in language as a perseverative focus on idiosyncratic topics. In this paper, we use semantic similarity measures to identify such idiosyncratic topics in narratives produced by children with and without ASD. We find that neurotypical children tend to use the same words and semantic concepts when retelling the same narrative, while children with ASD, even when producing accurate retellings, use different words and concepts relative not only to neurotypical children but also to other children with ASD. Our results indicate that children with ASD not only stray from the target topic but do so in idiosyncratic ways according to their own restricted interests.</abstract>

Applying the Monte Carlo permutation method, we calculate the statistical significance of the following comparisons: TD.TD vs ASD.ASD; TD.TD vs TD.ASD; and TD.ASD vs ASD.ASD. Table 2 summarizes the results of these significance tests. In all cases, the differences are significant at p &lt; 0.05 except for the first two comparisons in the t-test permutation of SimRF, which narrowly eluded significance. 5 Conclusions and future work High-functioning children with ASD have long been described as “little professors”, using pedantic or overly-adult language (Asperger, 1944). Low lexical overlap similarity measures by themselves might indicate that children with ASD are using semantically appropriate but infrequent or sophisticated words that were not used by other children. We note, however, that the knowledgebased overlap measures follow the same pattern as the purely lexical overlap measures. This suggests that it not the case that children with ASD are simply using rare synonyms of the more common words used by TD children. Instead, it seems that the children with ASD are moving away from the target topic and following their own individual and idiosyncratic s</context>

The NNM was administered by a trained clinician to each study participant, and each participant’s retelling was recorded, transcribed, and evaluated according to the published scoring guidelines. Under standard administration of the NNM, a retelling is scored according to how many story elements from a predetermined list it contains. The guidelines for scoring do not require verbatim recall for most elements and generally allow the use of synonyms and paraphrases. As is typically reported when comparing matched groups (Diehl et al., 2006), we observed no significant difference in the standard NNM free recall score between the TD group (mean = 6.25, sd = 3.43) and the ASD group (mean = 4.90, sd = 3.72). It might seem that a low similarity score between two retellings simply indicates that one retelling includes fewer story elements. However, given the equivalent number of story elements recalled by the two groups, we can assume that a low similarity score indicates a difference in the quality rather than the quantity of information in the retellings. 3 Semantic similarity measures We expect that two different retellings of the </context>

Conventional IDF weights are therefore not useful for our particular purpose. Instead, we remove closed-class function words to avoid their bias in our similarity measures.

The same procedure is applied to vm, and finally the similarity score between n and m is derived from the cosine score between vn and vm. 3.2.2 WordNet-based mutual similarity In a modified version of WordNet-based mutual similarity (SimWM) (Mihalcea et al., 2006), we find the maximum similarity score S(wi, m) for each word wi in narrative n with words in narrative m as described in Equation 4.

Our results indicate that children with ASD not only stray from the target topic but do so in idiosyncratic ways according to their own restricted interests. 1 Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication and social behavior. One of the core symptoms is a preoccupation with specific restricted interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), and several commonly used diagnostic instruments for ASD instruct examiners to evaluate the degree to which subjects display this characteristic (Lord et al., 2002; Rutter et al., 2003). In verbal individuals with ASD, such a preoccupation can be expressed as a tendency to fixate on a particular idiosyncratic topic. Previous research relying on expert annotation of spoken language in children with ASD has found that their spoken narratives and conversations include significantly more instances of irrelevant content and more topic digressions (Loveland et al., 1990; Losh and Capps, 2003; Lam et al., 2012). Similar results at the lexical level have been reported using automated annotations (Prud’hommeaux and Rouhizadeh, 2012; Rouhizadeh et al., 2013). There has been little wor</context>

ASD was diagnosed via clinical consensus according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and the established thresholds on two widely-used diagnostic instruments: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2002) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (Rutter et al., 2003). No children met the criteria for a language impairment, and there were no significant between-group differences in age or full-scale IQ. To elicit retellings, we used the Narrative Memory subtest of the NEPSY (Korkman et al., 1998), a large battery of tasks testing neurocognitive functioning in children. In the NEPSY Narrative Memory (NNM) subtest, the subject listens to a brief narrative about a boy and his dog and then must retell the narrative to the examiner. Figure 1 shows two sample retellings from our corpus. The NNM was administered by a trained clinician to each study participant, a</context>

It is therefore possible that children with autism are discussing the appropriate topic but choosing unusual words within that topic space in their retellings. We therefore use a set of measures that consider the semantic overlap of two narratives using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) similarities (Achananuparp et al., 2008), in order to distinguish instances of atypical but semantically appropriate language from true examples of poor topic maintenance. Because WordNet-based similarity measures only consider word pairs with the same part-of-speech, we POS-tagged the data using a perceptron tagger (Yarmohammadi, 2014). 3.2.1 WordNet-based vector similarity In a modified version ofWordNet-based vector similarity, SimWV ), (Li et al., 2006), we first create vectors vn and vm for each narrative n and m, where each element corresponds to a word in the type union of n and m. We assign values to each element e in vn using the following formulation: � (4) 1 ifeEn S(e, n) = max LS(e, wi) otherwise wi∈n where LS is Lin’s universal similarity (Lin, 1998). In other words, if the element e is present in n, S(e, n) will be 1. If not, the most similar word to e will be chosen from words in n using Lin’s universal simila</context>
