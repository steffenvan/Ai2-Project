As information explodes in the Internet, it’s hard for
users to read through all the published materials poten-
tially interesting. Therefore, it is of great help to present
them in a condensed way, i.e. using extracts or abstracts
that generalize the content of an article. Text summari-
zation is the process of distilling the most important
information from a source (or sources) to produce an
abridged version for a particular user (or users) and task
(or tasks) (Mani and Maybury, 1999). Summary can
help the user quickly get a general idea about the article
and decide if it deserves more detailed attention.
The problem with present summarization systems is
that they produce one uniform summary for a given
document without considering users’ opinions on it,
while different users may have different perspectives on
the same text, thus need a different summary. A good
summary should change corresponding to interests and
preferences of its reader. We refer to the adaptation of
the summarization process to a particular user as per-
sonalized summarization. We wish to extract the kind of
personalized summary in this paper.
Annotating is a common behavior while reading,
since many users would like to make some remarks or
to highlight some important parts of the text. So we
think that, to some extent, annotations represent users’
interests by recording some viewpoints of users on the
documents, such as which part is important or interest-
ing, which is not. With the rapidly technologies im-
provements on tablet-pc, it is possible to record these
behaviors automatically. From another point, annota-
tions can be seen as a kind of user feedback, but differ-
ent from traditional explicit relevance feedback (Salton
and Buckley, 1990) in the sense of that annotation can
be collected automatically without user’s consciousness.
Since annotation is a kind of personal data, it is ex-
pected to help improve the personalization of present

<bodyText confidence="0.995575365079365">
For one document, current summarization sys-
tems produce a uniform version of summary
for all users. Personalized summarizations are
necessary in order to represent users’ prefer-
ences and interests. Annotation is getting im-
portant for document sharing and
collaborative filtering, which in fact record
users’ dynamic behaviors compared to tradi-
tional steady profiles. In this paper we intro-
duce a new summarization system based on
users’ annotations. Annotations and their con-
texts are extracted to represent features of sen-
tences, which are given different weights for
representation of the document. Our system
produces two versions of summaries for each
document: generic summary without consider-
ing annotations and annotation-based sum-
mary. Since annotation is a kind of personal
data, annotation-based summary is tailored to
user’s interests to some extent. We show by
experiments that annotations can help a lot in
improving summarization performance com-
pared to no annotation consideration. At the
same time, we make an extensive study on us-
ers’ annotating behaviors and annotations dis-
tribution, and propose a variety of techniques
to evaluate the relationships between annota-
tions and summaries, such as how the number
of annotations affects the summarizing per-
formance. A study about collaborative filter-
ing is also made to evaluate the
summarization based on annotations of similar
users.

soft Research Asia.
document summarizers; also, intention of users can be
learned through this interaction process.
Since a user may make annotations freely, not all of
them are useful for representing his real preferences.
Therefore it is helpful to find how some of the annota-
tions affect on summarization performance, based on
that, we make a study on evaluations about the number
of annotations effective.
In spite of summarization based on the user’s anno-
tation himself, we want to do more when his annotation
on current document is not available. Suppose he is new
to the domain, but other users annotated on the docu-
ment, we can resort to annotations of similar users to
help his summarization. Study in such situation is
thought of as collaboratively filtering which filter the
useful information from similar users to help the sum-
marization of current user. To our knowledge, no work
has been done about such annotation studies.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces some related work in text summa-
rization. Section 3 presents the new annotation based
text summarization approach, including annotation, con-
text and keywords extraction, and summary generation.
Section 4 gives the metrics for evaluation of annotated
summarization. Section 5 discusses the detailed experi-
ments and evaluation of summarization, annotations and
collaborative filtering. Section 6 concludes the paper
with a simple summary and future work.

To summarize, is to reduce complexity of documents,
hence, in length, while retaining some of the important
information in the original documents. Titles, keywords,
tables-of-contents and abstracts might all be considered
as forms of summary; here, we consider summary as a
set of sentences containing some of the essential infor-
mation from the original document.
A lot of approaches were proposed in text summari-
zation, such as word frequency based method (Luhn,
1958), cue phrase method (Edmundson, 1969), Position-
based methods (Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997;
Teufel and Moens, 1997).
At the same time, some machine learning methods
were used to integrate different clues in documents.
Given a corpus and its predefined summaries as training
set, it is to identify the relationships between documents
and their summaries, the sentences which satisfy the
rules are the ones to be extracted (Kupiec et al., 1995).
Other machine learning methods perform sentence clus-
tering based on a set of extracted features of sentences,
and, choose a representative sentence from each cluster,
and combine them into a summary according to their
original order in the text (Nomoto and Matsumoto,
2001).
Most of the above techniques have the limitations
we have mentioned at the beginning, they failed to sup-
ply a personalized summary which reflects the interests
and preferences of different users.
There were some work based on annotation
(Golovchinsky et al., 1999; Price et al., 1998), but they
mainly focus on supplying an authoring tool which
gives instructions on how to do annotation; or annota-
tion identification and extraction which is difficult since
annotation may be done freely and randomly; or annota-
tion based query which aims at query expansion based
on annotations. But rarely people think of using annota-
tion for summarization. In fact, we only found one work
about summarization based on annotation (Nagao and
Hasida, 1998), but annotations there are defined on a
complex set of GDA (Global Document Annotation)
tags, which is an XML-based tag set, and allows ma-
chines to automatically infer underlying structures of
documents by parsing, and authors of WWW files can
annotate their documents by those tags, but they are not
studied further about how to affect the summarization.
Since annotations reflect user’s opinions, different
users may have different annotations; thus summariza-
tions based on annotations are tailored to users’ interests
to some extent. Therefore we will integrate annotations
into our summarization framework, which is expected to
supply personalized summaries for given users, and
different from traditional uniform summary. Here we
make an assumption that what are annotated is interest-
ing or important compared to other parts of document,
which is reasonable since this is a common view about
why users make annotations.
In this paper, we mainly focus on the kind of annota-
tions that are parts of the text in order to avoid complex
manuscript recognition. Since we mainly consider the
effect of annotations on the performance of summariza-
tion, annotations can only make sense when they are
thought of as keywords. However, past experiments
show that keywords method has a lower performance
when working with other methods (Edmundson, 1969;
Teufel and Moens, 1997), so the main approach we used
here is based on key words frequency.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999647">
Annotation is defined as a body of words marked
among the text. It may be any word, phrase or sentences
which readers may feel interesting or important. When
we say “annotation”, we mean its position and content,
that is, where it is located and what texts it contains.
Since users may annotate part of the important informa-
tion, or the annotations may be incomplete, therefore, in
spite of annotations themselves, we also need to con-
sider “context” as a supplement to what users are inter-
ested in. For a particular annotation, context is defined
the surrounding text of the annotation.
Since annotations contain a set of keywords, its sig-
nificance can be identified when compared to other
words of the text. For a given document, we first extract
user’s annotations and their contexts, and construct a
new keywords set together with original keywords in
the text, where annotations and contexts are given
higher scores than others; Then we weight sentences
according to keywords they contained and do summari-
zation by selecting high-weighted ones.

3.1 Annotations &amp;Context Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986245058823529">
A set of sentences is extracted from a given document.
And for each annotation, we identify which sentence it
is located at, as the context of the annotation. Then
keywords are extracted from annotations and their con-
texts. An annotation may span through several sentences,
a sentence may include several annotations, and an an-
notation may contain several keywords. For each sen-
tence, we simplify the keywords extraction problem as
identifying the annotations it contains. Annotated sen-
tences are defined as those who contain annotations.
The keywords occurring in annotations are called anno-
tated keywords (F1). Keywords occurring in annotated
sentences are called context keywords (F2). Frequen-
cies f of repetitive keywords in F1 or F2 are accumu-
lated. It’s obvious that F1 is a subset of F2. Thus we get
two keywords vector set:
Annotated keywords (F1):

<bodyText confidence="0.972896666666667">
From the document, content words are stemmed from
Porter’s algorithm (Porter, 1980). Content keywords are
referred to words whose frequencies are beyond a cer-
tain threshold and not occurring in stopping wordlist.
Word frequencies are calculated by tf*idf method (Sal-
ton and Buckley, 1988). After applying word occur-
rences statistics to full text; we get the vector
set&lt;wi, f i &gt;.
Text keywords are those occurred either in F2 or
their frequency satisfies a given threshold O ( fi &gt; O).
Annotated words are considered superiorly whatever
frequency they occur originally, since users may be in-
terested in some rare or “unknown” keywords in the
documents, this kind of words should not be excluded
beyond text keywords.
Text keywords (F0):
F =&lt; w i f i &gt; ❑ i ❑ n n = size F
0 0 , 0 ,1 0, 0 ( 0
It is obvious that both F1 and F2 are subsets of F0.
Next in order to apply the emphasis of annotations
and contexts on summarization, combination is per-
formed to integrate F0, F1 and F2. Since keywords in
different sets may have different influences on summa-
rization, some parameters are used to balance their ef-
fects respectively.
Final keywords (F): F = F0 + P F1 + y F2;
F =&lt; wi , fi &gt;,1 ❑i ❑ n, n = size(F)
P is annotation weight (P &gt;=0), γ is context weight (γ

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998060625">
The problem of evaluating text summarization is a quite
deep one, and some problems remain concerning the
appropriate methods and types of evaluation. There are
a variety of possible bases for comparison of summari-
zation performance, e.g., summary to source, system to
manual summary. In general, methods for text summa-
rization can be classified into two categories (Firmin
and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999). The first is
intrinsic evaluation, which judge the quality of the
summarization directly based on analysis of the sum-
mary, including user judgments of fluency of the sum-
mary, coverage of the “key/essential ideas”, or similarly
to an “ideal” summary which is hard to establish. The
other is extrinsic evaluation, which judge the quality of
the summarization based on how it affects on the com-
pletion of other tasks, such as question answering and
comprehension tasks.
Here we use intrinsic evaluation for our summariza-
tion performance. It is to compare the system summary
with an ideal manual summary. Since we need to collect
annotations for experimented documents, which require
reading through the text, manual summaries can be
made consequently after the reading.
The documents dataset to be evaluated are supplied
with human annotations and summaries, which will be
described in detail in the next section.
For one annotated document, our annotation based
summarization (ABS) system produce two versions of
summaries: generic summary without considering an-
notations, and annotated summary considering annota-
tions. For evaluation, we made comparison between
human-made summary and generic summary, and com-

parisons between human-made summary and annotated
summary. There are a lot of measures to make the com-
parisons (Firmin and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury,
1999), such as precision, recall, some of which will be
used for our evaluation. Another measure we are inter-
ested in is the cosine similarity for two summaries,
which is defined on keywords, and reflects the general
similarity of two summaries in global distribution. For
human-made summary S0 and summary Si generated by
ABS, summary similarity is as follows:

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.998194285714286">
Precision and recall are generally applied to sen-
tences; in fact they can be applied to keywords too,
which reflects the percentage of keywords correctly
identified. Therefore, in spite of summary similarity, our
measures for evaluation also include sentences precision,
sentences recall, keywords precision and keywords re-
call. For keywords evaluation, a keyword is correct only
if it occurs in human-made summary. For sentences
evaluation, a sentence in summary is correct if it has as
many possible keywords as in the corresponding sen-
tence in the human-made summary, that is, their similar-
ity (calculated same as summary similarity) is beyond a
certain threshold. We use two types of sentences match
in the experiments: one is perfect match, which means a
sentence in summary is correct only if it occurs in man-
ual summary; the other is conditional match, which
means most concepts of the two sentences are correct, in
this case the match similarity threshold is less than 1.
For a set of annotated documents, average values for
the above five measures are calculated to show the gen-
eral performance of the comparison.

5 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967068965517">
Since our approaches are based on annotated documents,
we need to collect users’ annotations for a set of docu-
ments. In the meantime, users are required to supply a
summary consisting of several sentences that reflects
the main ideas of the document. We supply an annotat-
ing tool called “Annotation” that can be used to high-
light words, phrases, or sentences which users are
interested in, and to select important sentences into
summary.
The original data we used is from Yahoo news,
which is interesting to most users. The data is composed
of eight categories: business, sports, entertainment,
world, science, technology, politics, and oddly, with
totally about 6000 documents. Documents are preproc-
essed and removed graphics and tags before experi-
ments. We hired five students 10 days to annotate the
documents, each student were supplied 20 percent of the
documents. They are allowed to choose articles interest-
ing to do the experiments. Users are told to make anno-
tations freely and summaries which reflect the main
ideas of the text. The process of annotating and summa-
rizing for one user are independent, that is, they are
done at different time. At last, we collect totally 1098
different annotated documents, each of which consists
of a set of annotations and a human-made summary.
The statistics for five persons is presented in table 11,
which shows that the average summary length (sen-
tences number) is 6.11, and the average annotations
number is 11.86.

Since different users may have different annotation style,
we separate the experiments for each individual’s data.
In experiments, the keyword threshold α is set 2, which
is reasonable that most keywords’ frequency is at least 2.
The threshold for summary similarity related to sen-
tences precision, is 0.3 (which in fact means its square
root 55% sentences are correct). The summarizer pro-
duce the same number of sentences as are in the corre-
sponding manual summary, as in (Kupiec et al., 1995),
therefore, precision and recall are the same for summa-
ries sentences comparison.
First, we make experiments with different annota-
tions and context weights. The results are presented in
Table.2. The first column contains different combina-
tions of annotation weight β and context weighty, as
described in Section 3.2. See 2 for the meanings of other
columns. It is obvious that context can help to improve
the summarization performance than no context consid-
eration, so in our later experiments, we set the context
weight y=1, and annotation weight β=1.

5.2 Annotation Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
In our last experiments, we found that the average anno-
tation number was 11.86, which was much higher than
summary length. We wonder whether there are some
relations between the number of annotations and sum-
marization performance. Thus we make such annota-
tions evaluations to study how the number of
annotations affects on summarization performance.
The first experiment is to find the best summary by
selecting the first k (k&lt;n, n is total number of annota-
tions) annotations, that is “first Best Annotated sum-
mary”. In fact, from figure 1 we can see that when using
all of the annotations, the performance falls about in the
middle of generic summary and first Best Annotated
summary (labeled by “BA”). However we found that, in
some annotated documents, some of annotations are
beyond the scope of the manual summary. This means
that some of them are noisy to summarization; using all
of them cannot reach the best performance; there must
have a changing process of performance as more anno-
tations are considered, which confirms us to explore the
relationship between the annotation number and the
summarization performance.
So the next experiment is to observe how the aver-
age summarization performance evolves as we select
any of the k annotations. That is, for any annotation
number k&lt;n, to average the summarization performance
by enumerating all possible annotations combinations.
Figure 2 presents such a plot for a document
“sports_78.html”, which indicates how the number of
annotations affects summarization performance. It has
totally 15 annotations, “0” stands for generic summary
performance. When considering only one annotation,
the performance drops a bit down (We found in this
document some of the single annotations are far away
from corresponding summary), but as more annotations
considered, the performance begins to increase slowly
and reaches the best at annotation number 12, then again
begins to drop. For other documents, we find similar

situations that at beginning the performance increases
along the number of annotations, but after it reaches a
certain degree, the performance will fluctuate and some-
times drop slightly down. These are all true for our 5
evaluation measures, which are consistent and reason-
able since too many annotations will introduce some
degree of noise, which would bias the summarization
process. We conclude from this evolving process that
not all of the annotations are valuable for summarization.

Different documents have different annotations,
which have different influences on summarization. In
most cases, best summaries are better than all annota-
tions-based summaries, which are better than generic
and worst summaries. There is an exception in Figure 3
at Document 5, we found in this document some of the
annotations are irrelevant to the summary. For example,
in this document, percentage of summary annotated
sentences in annotated sentences is 28.57%; and per-
centage of summary annotated keywords in summary
keywords is only 17.19%. While for Document 6, the
corresponding values are 50.00% and 32.73%. This
indicates that the user’s interests drifted as he read the
document.
When annotations are consistent with users’ summa-
ries, they help to improve the personalization of summa-
rization, the more the better, otherwise, when the
annotations are far from users’ summaries, the influence
of annotations may be negative, for example some an-
notations subset make the performance worse. But gen-
erally the former has a much larger proportion than the
latter. Along the documents in figure 3, the main trend
is that annotation-based summaries are better than
summaries with no annotations consideration; the aver-
age improvement for 12 documents is 13.49%.

Another part of our experiments is about collaborative
filtering, which identifies how much effect one user’s
annotation is on others’ summaries. To do that, we addi-
tionally invited the previous 5 users to annotate and
summarize 100 common documents. After removing
some bad data, we got totally 91 common documents at
last. For each user’s data, we will find whether it is
helpful when his annotations are applied on other users’
summarizations. Figure 4 presents the contributions of
user P3’s annotation on the total five persons’ summari-
zation. Intuitively, P3’s annotations are most helpful to
P3’s summaries; they also have some contributions to
P2, P4 and P1’s according to importance, but make
negative effects on P5’s summarization. This indicates
that P3’s interest is most close to P2’s, but far from P5’s.
This is possibly understandable since different users
have different preferences for a document, thus their
annotations style may have significant variances.

summarization among other four persons. In fact we
found most of the annotations of P2 and P3 are similar
for most documents. For example, in document “busi-
ness_642.txt” whose title is “Stocks Sag; EDS Warnings
Whacks IBM Lower”, we found that, P2 and both P3
annotated “drooped, Computer makers, Homebuilders,
Federal Reserve”, which occupies 27% of P2’s annota-

In table 4, we calculate the annotations cosine similarity
for any two users, and found that averaged 37% of P3

interest group, while P5 belongs to another.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999812">
This paper introduces a new document summarization
approach based on users’ annotations. Annotations are
used to help generate personalized summary for a par-
ticular document. Contexts are also considered to make
up the incompleteness of annotations. Two types of
summaries are produced for each document: generic
summary without considering annotations and annota-
tion-based summary. Performance comparisons are
made between these two summaries. We show by ex-
periments that annotations are quite useful in improving
the personalization of summarization compared to no
annotations consideration.
We made extensive evaluations on the relationships
between annotations and summaries, and concluded that
annotation selection is necessary in order to get a best
summarization. We will try to identify how to choose an
appropriate subset of annotations that make summariza-
tion best, which is challenging due to the variety of us-
ers’ interests in different documents.
We also did collaborative filtering to find whether
one user’s annotation is helpful for other’s summariza-
tion. The answer is positive that summarization per-
formance can be improved based on similar users’
annotations. For the next step, we think that “similar
users” needs more precise definition to improve the
performance of collaborative filtering.
As an extension of collaborative filtering, more
work will be done for multi-documents summarization
based on annotations of similar ones. They will help
user to get a global personal view for a set of documents.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the kind of annotations that are parts of the text in order to avoid complex manuscript recognition. Since we mainly consider the effect of annotations on the performance of summarization, annotations can only make sense when they are thought of as keywords. However, past experiments show that keywords method has a lower performance when working with other methods (Edmundson, 1969; Teufel and Moens, 1997), so the main approach we used here is based on key words frequency. 3 Annotation based summarization Annotation is defined as a body of words marked among the text. It may be any word, phrase or sentences which readers may feel interesting or important. When we say “annotation”, we mean its position and content, that is, where it is located and what texts it contains. Since users may annotate part of the important information, or the annotations may be incomplete, therefore, in spite of annotations themselves, we also need to consider “context” as a supplement to what</context>

Annotating is a common behavior while reading, since many users would like to make some remarks or to highlight some important parts of the text. So we think that, to some extent, annotations represent users’ interests by recording some viewpoints of users on the documents, such as which part is important or interesting, which is not. With the rapidly technologies improvements on tablet-pc, it is possible to record these behaviors automatically. From another point, annotations can be seen as a kind of user feedback, but different from traditional explicit relevance feedback (Salton and Buckley, 1990) in the sense of that annotation can be collected automatically without user’s consciousness.

In experiments, the keyword threshold α is set 2, which is reasonable that most keywords’ frequency is at least 2. The threshold for summary similarity related to sentences precision, is 0.3 (which in fact means its square root 55% sentences are correct). The summarizer produce the same number of sentences as are in the corresponding manual summary, as in (Kupiec et al., 1995), therefore, precision and recall are the same for summaries sentences comparison. First, we make experiments with different annotations and context weights. The results are presented in Table.2. The first column contains different combinations of annotation weight β and context weighty, as described in Section 3.2. See 2 for the meanings of other columns. It is obvious that context can help to improve the summarization performance than no context consideration, so in our later experiments, we set the context weight y=1, and annotation weight β=1. 1 For ease of representation in table 1, “Pi” </context>

Therefore, it is of great help to present them in a condensed way, i.e. using extracts or abstracts that generalize the content of an article. Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source (or sources) to produce an abridged version for a particular user (or users) and task (or tasks) (Mani and Maybury, 1999). Summary can help the user quickly get a general idea about the article and decide if it deserves more detailed attention. The problem with present summarization systems is that they produce one uniform summary for a given document without considering users’ opinions on it, while different users may have different perspectives on the same text, thus need a different summary. A good summary should change corresponding to interests and preferences of its reader. We refer to the adaptation of the summarization process to a particular user as personalized summarization. We wish to extract the kin</context>

Sentences are ranked by their weights, and then top scored sentences are selected as important ones and used to compose into a summary according to their original position. 4 Evaluation The problem of evaluating text summarization is a quite deep one, and some problems remain concerning the appropriate methods and types of evaluation. There are a variety of possible bases for comparison of summarization performance, e.g., summary to source, system to manual summary. In general, methods for text summarization can be classified into two categories (Firmin and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999). The first is intrinsic evaluation, which judge the quality of the summarization directly based on analysis of the summary, including user judgments of fluency of the summary, coverage of the “key/essential ideas”, or similarly to an “ideal” summary which is hard to establish. The other is extrinsic evaluation, which judge the quality of the summarization based on how it affects on the completion of other tasks, such as question answering and comprehension tasks. Here we use intrinsic evaluation for our summarization performance. It is to compare the system summary with an ideal manual summar</context>

The documents dataset to be evaluated are supplied with human annotations and summaries, which will be described in detail in the next section. For one annotated document, our annotation based summarization (ABS) system produce two versions of summaries: generic summary without considering annotations, and annotated summary considering annotations. For evaluation, we made comparison between human-made summary and generic summary, and com) wi 1 2 f parisons between human-made summary and annotated summary. There are a lot of measures to make the comparisons (Firmin and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999), such as precision, recall, some of which will be used for our evaluation. Another measure we are interested in is the cosine similarity for two summaries, which is defined on keywords, and reflects the general similarity of two summaries in global distribution. For human-made summary S0 and summary Si generated by ABS, summary similarity is as follows: • f , j i j , ( ∑f0,j2) •(∑ f;,j2) wj∈S0 wj∈Si Number of correct items retrieved Number of retrieved items Re call = Number of correct items retrieved Number of correct items Precision and recall are generally applied to sentences; in fact the</context>

Other machine learning methods perform sentence clustering based on a set of extracted features of sentences, and, choose a representative sentence from each cluster, and combine them into a summary according to their original order in the text (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001). Most of the above techniques have the limitations we have mentioned at the beginning, they failed to supply a personalized summary which reflects the interests and preferences of different users. There were some work based on annotation (Golovchinsky et al., 1999; Price et al., 1998), but they mainly focus on supplying an authoring tool which gives instructions on how to do annotation; or annotation identification and extraction which is difficult since annotation may be done freely and randomly; or annotation based query which aims at query expansion based on annotations. But rarely people think of using annotation for summarization. In fact, we only found one work about summarization based on annotation (Nagao and Hasida, 1998), but annotations there are defined on a complex set of GDA (Global Document Annotation) tags, which is an XML-based tag set, and allows machines</context>

Frequencies f of repetitive keywords in F1 or F2 are accumulated. It’s obvious that F1 is a subset of F2.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the kind of annotations that are parts of the text in order to avoid complex manuscript recognition. Since we mainly consider the effect of annotations on the performance of summarization, annotations can only make sense when they are thought of as keywords. However, past experiments show that keywords method has a lower performance when working with other methods (Edmundson, 1969; Teufel and Moens, 1997), so the main approach we used here is based on key words frequency. 3 Annotation based summarization Annotation is defined as a body of words marked among the text. It may be any word, phrase or sentences which readers may feel interesting or important. When we say “annotation”, we mean its position and content, that is, where it is located and what texts it contains. Since users may annotate part of the important information, or the annotations may be incomplete, therefore, in spite of annotations themselves, we also need to consider “context” as a supplement to what users are interested in.</context>
