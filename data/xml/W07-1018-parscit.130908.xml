Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999839578947368">
We propose a methodology using
underspecified semantic interpretation to
process comparative constructions in
MEDLINE citations, concentrating on two
structures that are prevalent in the research
literature reporting on clinical trials for
drug therapies. The method exploits an
existing semantic processor, SemRep,
which constructs predications based on the
Unified Medical Language System. Results
of a preliminary evaluation were recall of
70%, precision of 96%, and F-score of
81%. We discuss the generalization of the
methodology to other entities such as
therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. The
available structures in computable format
are potentially useful for interpreting
outcome statements in MEDLINE
citations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875894736842">
As natural language processing (NLP) is
increasingly able to support advanced information
management techniques for research in medicine
and biology, it is being incrementally improved to
provide extended coverage and more accurate
results. In this paper, we discuss the extension of
an existing semantic interpretation system to
address comparative structures. These structures
provide a way of explicating the characteristics of
one entity in terms of a second, thereby enhancing
the description of the first. This phenomenon is
important in clinical research literature reporting
the results of clinical trials.
In the abstracts of these reports, a treatment for
some disease is typically discussed using two types
of comparative structures. The first announces that
the (primary) therapy focused on in the study will
be compared to some other (secondary) therapy. A
typical example is (1).

(1) Lansoprazole compared with
ranitidine for the treatment of
nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux
disease.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.946835625">
An outcome statement (2) often appears near the
end of the abstract, asserting results in terms of the
relative merits of the primary therapy compared to
the secondary.
(2) Lansoprazole is more
effective than ranitidine in
patients with endoscopically
confirmed non-erosive reflux
esophagitis.
The processing of comparative expressions such
as (1) and (2) was incorporated into an existing
system, SemRep [Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003;
Rindflesch et al., 2005], which constructs semantic
predications by mapping assertions in biomedical
text to the Unified Medical Language System®
(UMLS)® [Humphreys et al., 1998].

<bodyText confidence="0.992329142857143">
The range of comparative expressions in English is
extensive and complex. Several linguistic studies
have investigated their characteristics, with
differing assumptions about syntax and semantics
(for example [Ryan, 1981; Rayner and Banks,
1990; Staab and Hahn, 1997; Huddleston and
Pullum, 2002]). Our study concentrates on

structures in which two drugs are compared with
respect to a shared attribute (e.g. how well they
treat some disease). An assessment of their relative
merit in this regard is indicated by their positions
on a scale. The compared terms are expressed as
noun phrases, which can be considered to be
conjoined. The shared characteristic focused on is
expressed as a predicate outside the comparative
structure. An adjective or noun is used to denote
the scale, and words such as than, as, with, and to
serve as cues to identify the compared terms, the
scale, and the relative position of the terms on the
scale.
The first type of structure we address (called
comp1 and illustrated in (3)) merely asserts that the
primary and secondary terms (in bold) are being
compared. A possible cue for identifying these
structures is a form of compare. A further
characteristic is that the compared terms are
separated by a conjunction, or a preposition, as in
(3).

misoprostol with dinoprostone for

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999601785714286">
In the more complex comparative expression we
accommodate (called comp2), the relative ranking
of two compared terms is indicated on a scale
denoted by an adjective (e.g. effective in (5)). The
relative position of the compared terms in scalar
comparative structures of this type expresses either
equality or inequality. Inequality is further divided
into superiority, where the primary compared term
is higher on the scale than the secondary, and
inferiority, where the opposite is true. Cues
associated with the adjective designating the scale
signal these phenomena (e.g. as ADJ as in (5) for
equality, ADJer than in (6) for superiority, and less
ADJ than in (7) for inferiority).

<bodyText confidence="0.99979425">
In examples (3) through (7), the characteristic the
compared drugs have in common is treatment of
some disorder, for example treatment of pertussis
in children in (5).
Few studies describe an implemented automatic
analysis of comparatives; however, Friedman
[Friedman, 1989] is a notable exception. Jindal and
Liu [Jindal and Liu, 2006] use machine learning to
identify some comparative structures, but do not
provide a semantic interpretation. We exploit
SemRep machinery to interpret the aspects of
comparative structures just described.

2.2 SemRep
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997509692307692">
SemRep [Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003;
Rindflesch et al., 2005] recovers underspecified
semantic propositions in biomedical text based on
a partial syntactic analysis and structured domain
knowledge from the UMLS. Several systems that
extract entities and relations are under
development in both the clinical and molecular
biology domains. Examples of systems for clinical
text are described in [Friedman et al., 1994],
[Johnson et al., 1993], [Hahn et al., 2002], and
[Christensen et al., 2002]. In molecular biology,
examples include [Yen et al., 2006], [Chun et al.,
2006], [Blaschke et al., 1999], [Leroy et al., 2003],
[Rindflesch et al., 2005], [Friedman et al., 2001],
and [Lussier et al., 2006].
During SemRep processing, a partial syntactic
parse is produced that depends on lexical look-up
in the SPECIALIST lexicon [McCray et al., 1994]
and a part-of-speech tagger [Smith et al., 2004].
MetaMap [Aronson, 2001] then matches noun
phrases to concepts in the Metathesaurus® and
determines the semantic type for each concept. For
example, the structure in (9), produced for (8),
allows both syntactic and semantic information to
be used in further SemRep processing that
interprets semantic predications.

Predicates are derived from indicator rules that
map syntactic phenomena (such as verbs and
nominalizations) to relationships in the UMLS
Semantic Network. Argument identification is
guided by dependency grammar rules as well as
constraints imposed by the Semantic Network. In
processing (8), for example, an indicator rule links
the nominalization treatment with the Semantic
Network relation “Pharmacologic Substance
TREATS Disease or Syndrome.” Since the
semantic types of the syntactic arguments
identified for treatment in this sentence
(‘Pharmacologic Substance’ for “lansoprazole” and
‘Disease or Syndrome’ for “Gastroesophageal
reflux disease”) match the corresponding semantic
types in the relation from the Semantic Network,

<bodyText confidence="0.999969176470588">
We extracted sentences for developing
comparative processing from a set of some 10,000
MEDLINE citations reporting on the results of
clinical trials, a rich source of comparative
structures. In this sample, the most frequent
patterns for comp1 (only announces that two terms
are compared) and comp2 (includes a scale and
positions on that scale) are given in (11) and (12).
In the patterns, Term1 and Term2 refer to the
primary and secondary compared terms,
respectively. “{BE}” means that some form of be
is optional, and slash indicates disjunction. These
patterns served as guides for enhancing SemRep
argument identification machinery but were not
implemented as such. That is, they indicate
necessary components but do not preclude
intervening modifiers and qualifiers.

As with SemRep in general, the interpretation of
comparative structures exploits underspecified
syntactic structure enhanced with Metathesaurus
concepts and semantic types. Semantic groups
[McCray et al., 2001] from the Semantic Network
are also available. For this project, we exploit the
group Chemicals &amp; Drugs, which contains such
semantic types as ‘Pharmacologic Substance’,
‘Antibiotic’, and ‘Immunologic Factor’. (The
principles used here also apply to compared terms
with semantic types from other semantic groups,
such as ‘Procedures’.) In the comp1 patterns, a
form of compare acts as an indicator of a
comparative predication. In comp2, the adjective
serves that function. Other words appearing in the
patterns cue the indicator word (in comp2) and
help identify the compared terms (in both comp1
and comp2). The conjunction versus is special in
that it cues the secondary compared term (Term2)
in comp1, but may also indicate a comp1 structure
in the absence of a form of compare (C5).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999704">
3.2 Interpreting comp1 patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973571428572">
When SemRep encounters a form of compare, it
assumes a comp1 structure and looks to the right
for the first noun phrase immediately preceded by
with, to, and, or versus. If the head of this phrase is
mapped to a concept having a semantic type in the
group Chemicals &amp; Drugs, it is marked as the
secondary compared term. The algorithm then
looks to the left of that term for a noun phrase
having a semantic type also in the group Chemicals
&amp; Drugs, which becomes the primary compared
term. When this processing is applied to (13), the
semantic predication (14) is produced, in which the
predicate is COMPARED_WITH; the first
argument is the primary compared term and the
</bodyText>

other is the secondary. As noted earlier, although a
scale is sometimes asserted in these structures (as
in (13)), SemRep does not retrieve it. An assertion
regarding position on the scale never appears in
comp1 structures.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999554333333333">
SemRep considers noun phrases occurring
immediately to the right and left of versus as being
compared terms if their heads have been mapped to
Metathesaurus concepts having semantic types
belonging to the group Chemicals &amp; Drugs. Such
noun phrases are interpreted as part of a comp1
structure, even if a form of compare has not
occurred. The predication (16) is derived from
(15).

SemRep treats compared terms as being
coordinated. For example, this identification
allows both “Lorazepam” and “Dimenhydrinate”
to function as arguments of TREATS in (15).
Consequently, in addition to (16), the predications
in (17) are returned as the semantic interpretation
of (15). Such processing is done for all comp1 and
comp2 structures (although these results are not
given for (13) and are not further discussed in this
paper).

3.3 Interpreting comp2 patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996698">
In addition to identifying two compared terms
when processing comp2 patterns, a scale must be
named and the relative position of the terms on that
scale indicated. The algorithm for finding
compared terms in comp2 structures begins by
locating one of the cues as, than, or to and then
examines the next noun phrase to the right. If its
head has been mapped to a concept with a
semantic type in the group Chemicals &amp; Drugs, it
is marked as the secondary compared term. As in
comp1, the algorithm then looks to the left for the
first noun phrase having a head in the same
semantic group, and that phrase is marked as the
primary compared term.
To find the scale name, SemRep examines the
secondary compared term and then locates the first
adjective to its left. The nominalization of that
adjective (as found in the SPECIALIST Lexicon)
is designated as the scale and serves as an
argument of the predicate SCALE in the
interpretation. For adjectives superior and inferior
(patterns S4 and S5 in (12)) the scale name is
“goodness.”
In determining relative position on the scale,
equality is contrasted with inequality. If the
adjective of the construction is immediately
preceded by as (pattern S1 in (12) above), the two
compared terms have the same position on the
scale (equality), and are construed as arguments of
a predication with predicate SAME_AS. In all
other comp2 constructions, the compared terms are
in a relationship of inequality. The primary
compared term is considered higher on the scale
unless the adjective is inferior or is preceded by
less, in which case the secondary term is higher.
The predicates HIGHER_THAN and
LOWER_THAN are used to construct predications
with the compared terms to interpret position on
the scale. The equality construction in (18) is
expressed as the predications in (19).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777">
Negation in comparative structures affects the
position of the compared terms on the scale, and is
accommodated differently for equality and for
inequality. When a scalar comparison of equality
(pattern S1, as ADJ as) is negated, the primary
term is lower on the scale than the secondary
(rather than being at least equal). For example, in
interpreting the negated equality construction in
(24), SemRep produces (25).

of inferiority comparatives (e.g. “X is not less
effective than Y”) is extremely rare in our sample.

3.5 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979285714286">
To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed
methods we created a test set of 300 sentences
containing comparative structures. These were
extracted by the second author (who did not
participate in the development of the methodology)
from 3000 MEDLINE citations published later in
date than the citations used to develop the
methodology. The citations were retrieved with a
PubMed query specifying randomized controlled
studies and comparative studies on drug therapy.
Sentences containing direct comparisons of the
pharmacological actions of two drugs expressed in
the target structures (comp1 and comp2) were
extracted starting from the latest retrieved citation
and continuing until 300 sentences with
comparative structures had been examined. These
were annotated with the PubMed ID of the citation,
names of two drugs (COMPARED_WITH
predication), the scale on which they are compared
(SCALE), and the relative position of the primary
drug with respect to the secondary (SAME_AS,
HIGHER_THAN, or LOWER_THAN).
The test sentences were processed using
SemRep and evaluated against the annotated test
set. We then computed recall and precision in
several ways: overall for all comparative
structures, for comp1 structures only, and for
comp2 structures only. To understand how the
overall identification of comparatives is influenced
by the components of the construction, we also
computed recall and precision separately for drug
names, scale, and position on scale (SAME_AS,
HIGHER THAN and LOWER THAN taken
together). Recall measures the proportion of
manually annotated categories that have been
correctly identified automatically. Precision
measures what proportion of the automatically
annotated categories is correct.
In addition, the overall identification of
comparative structures was evaluated using the F-
measure [Rijsbergen, 1979], which combines recall
and precision. The F-measure was computed using
macro-averaging and micro-averaging. Macro-
averaging was computed over each category first
and then averaged over the three categories (drug
names, scale, and position on scale). This approach
gives equal weight to each category. In micro-
averaging (which gives an equal weight to the
performance on each sentence) recall and precision

all entities and relations which are not drugs, scale,

<bodyText confidence="0.999781789473684">
Upon inspection of the SemRep processing results
we noticed that the test set contained nine
duplicates. In addition, four sentences were not
processed for various technical reasons. We report
the results for the remaining 287 sentences, which
contain 288 comparative structures occurring in
168 MEDLINE citations. Seventy four citations
contain 85 comp2 structures. The remaining 203
structures are comp1.
Correct identification of comparative structures
of both types depends on two factors: 1)
recognition of both drugs being compared, and 2)
recognition of the presence of a comparative
structure itself. In addition, correct identification of
the comp2 structures depends on recognition of the
scale on which the drugs are compared and the
relative position of the drugs on the scale. Table 1
presents recall, precision, and F-score reflecting
these factors.

indicate that approximately 30% of the drugs and
comparative structures of comp1, as well as 40%

however, all components are identified with high

<bodyText confidence="0.999698">
In examining SemRep errors, we determined that
more than 60% of the false negatives (for both
comp1 and comp2) were due to “empty heads”
[Chodorow et al., 1985; Guthrie et al., 1990], in
which the syntactic head of a noun phrase does not
reflect semantic thrust. Such heads prevent
SemRep from accurately determining the semantic
type and group of the noun phrase. In our sample,
expressions interpreted as empty heads include
those referring to drug dosage and formulations,
such as extended release (the latter often
abbreviated as XR). Examples of missed
interpretations are in sentences (28) and (29),
where the empty heads are in bold. Ahlers et al.
[Ahlers et al., 2007] discuss enhancements to
SemRep for accommodating empty heads. These
mechanisms are being incorporated into the
processing for comparative structures.

False positives were due exclusively to word

some of these errors.

The semantic predications returned by SemRep
to represent comparative expressions can be
considered a type of executable knowledge that
supports reasoning. Since the arguments in these
predications have been mapped to the UMLS, a
structured knowledge source, they can be
manipulated using that knowledge. It is also
possible to compute the transitive closure of all
SemRep output for a collection of texts to
determine which drug was asserted in that
collection to be the best with respect to some
characteristic. This ability could be very useful in
supporting question-answering applications.
As noted earlier, it is common in reporting on
the results of randomized clinical trials and
systematic reviews that a comp1 structure appears
early in the discourse to announce the objectives of
the study and that a comp2 structure often appears
near the end to give the results. Another example
of this phenomenon appears in (33) and (34) (from
PMID 15943841).
(33) To compare the efficacy of
famotidine and omeprazole in
Japanese patients with non-erosive
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
by a prospective randomized
multicentre trial.
(34) Omeprazole is more effective
than famotidine for the control of
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
symptoms in H. pylori-negative
patients.
We suggest one example of an application that
can benefit from the information provided by the
knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation
of comparative structures, and that is the
interpretation of outcome statements in MEDLINE
citations, as a method for supporting automatic
access to the latest results from clinical trials
research.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988852631579">
We expanded a symbolic semantic interpreter to
identify comparative constructions in biomedical
text. The method relies on underspecified syntactic
analysis and domain knowledge from the UMLS.
We identify two compared terms and scalar
comparative structures in MEDLINE citations.
Although we restricted the method to comparisons
of drug therapies, the method can be easily
generalized to other entities such as diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. The availability of this
information in computable format can support the
identification of outcome sentences in MEDLINE,
which in turn supports translation of biomedical
research into improvements in quality of patient
care.

<abstract confidence="0.9964686">We propose a methodology using underspecified semantic interpretation to process comparative constructions in MEDLINE citations, concentrating on two structures that are prevalent in the research literature reporting on clinical trials for drug therapies. The method exploits an existing semantic processor, SemRep, which constructs predications based on the Unified Medical Language System. Results of a preliminary evaluation were recall of 70%, precision of 96%, and F-score of 81%. We discuss the generalization of the methodology to other entities such as therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. The available structures in computable format are potentially useful for interpreting outcome statements in MEDLINE citations.</abstract>

In molecular biology, examples include [Yen et al., 2006], [Chun et al., 2006], [Blaschke et al., 1999], [Leroy et al., 2003], [Rindflesch et al., 2005], [Friedman et al., 2001], and [Lussier et al., 2006]. During SemRep processing, a partial syntactic parse is produced that depends on lexical look-up in the SPECIALIST lexicon [McCray et al., 1994] and a part-of-speech tagger [Smith et al., 2004].

(6) Naproxen is safer than aspirin in the treatment of the arthritis of rheumatic fever. (7) Sodium valproate was significantly less effective than prochlorperazine in reducing pain or nausea. In examples (3) through (7), the characteristic the compared drugs have in common is treatment of some disorder, for example treatment of pertussis in children in (5). Few studies describe an implemented automatic analysis of comparatives; however, Friedman [Friedman, 1989] is a notable exception. Jindal and Liu [Jindal and Liu, 2006] use machine learning to identify some comparative structures, but do not provide a semantic interpretation. We exploit SemRep machinery to interpret the aspects of comparative structures just described. 2.2 SemRep SemRep [Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003; Rindflesch et al., 2005] recovers underspecified semantic propositions in biomedical text based on a partial syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the UMLS.

To understand how the overall identification of comparatives is influenced by the components of the construction, we also computed recall and precision separately for drug names, scale, and position on scale (SAME_AS, HIGHER THAN and LOWER THAN taken together). Recall measures the proportion of manually annotated categories that have been correctly identified automatically. Precision measures what proportion of the automatically annotated categories is correct. In addition, the overall identification of comparative structures was evaluated using the Fmeasure [Rijsbergen, 1979], which combines recall and precision. The F-measure was computed using macro-averaging and micro-averaging. Macroaveraging was computed over each category first and then averaged over the three categories (drug names, scale, and position on scale). This approach gives equal weight to each category. In microaveraging (which gives an equal weight to the performance on each sentence) recall and precision 141 were obtained by summing over all individual sentences. Because it is impossible to enumerate all entities and relations which are not drugs, scale, or position we did not use the classific</context>
