We investigate the role of increasing
friendship in dialogue, and propose a first
step towards a computational model of the
role of long-term relationships in language
use between humans and embodied conver-
sational agents. Data came from a study of
friends and strangers, who either could or
could not see one another, and who were
asked to give directions to one-another,
three subsequent times. Analysis focused
on differences in the use of dialogue acts
and non-verbal behaviors, as well as co-
occurrences of dialogue acts, eye gaze and
head nods, and found a pattern of verbal
and nonverbal behavior that differentiates
the dialogue of friends from that of strang-
ers, and differentiates early acquaintances
from those who have worked together be-
fore. Based on these results, we present a
model of deepening rapport which would
enable an ECA to begin to model patterns
of human relationships.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980945945946">
What characterizes the language of people who
have known one another for a long time? In the US
one thinks of groups of friends, leaning in towards
one another, laughing, telling jokes at one an-
other’s expense, and interrupting one another in
their eagerness to contribute to the conversation.
The details may differ from culture to culture, but
the fact of differences between groups of friends
and groups of strangers are probably universal.
Which characteristics, if any, reliably differentiates
friends and strangers? Which can make a new
friend feel welcome? An old friend feel appreci-
ated? Advances in natural language are ensuring
that embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are
increasingly scintillating, emotionally and socially
expressive, and personality-rich. However, for the
most part, those same ECAs demonstrate amnesia,
beginning every conversation with a user as if it is
their first, and never getting past the stage of intro-
ductory remarks.
As the field of ECAs matures, and these systems
are found on an increasing number of platforms,
for an increasing number of applications, we feel
that it is time to ensure that ECAs be able to en-
gage in deepening relationships that make their
collaboration with humans productive and satisfy-
ing over long periods of time. To this end, in this
paper we examine the verbal and nonverbal corre-
lates of friendship in an empirical study, and then
take first steps towards a model of deepening
friendship and rapport in ECAs. The current study
is a part of a larger research program into linguistic
and social coordination devices from the utterance
level to the relationship level – how they work in
humans, how they can be modeled in virtual hu-
mans, and how virtual humans can be used to teach
people who wish to learn these skills.

2 Background &amp; Theory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964142857143">
As people become closer, their conversational
style changes. They may raise more topics in the
course of a conversation, refer more to themselves
as a single unit than as two people, and be more
responsive to one another’s talk (Cassell &amp; Tver-
sky, 2005; Hornstein, 1982). They also are likely
to sustain eye contact longer, smile more, and lean
more towards one another (Grahe &amp; Bernieri,
1999; Richmond &amp; McCroskey, 1995). In addition,
friends appear to have fewer difficulties with lexi-
cal search, perhaps because they can rely on
greater shared knowledge, and are more likely to
talk at the same time, and to negotiate turn-taking
in a less rigid manner, both through gaze and ges-

ture (Welji &amp; Duncan, 2005). Tickle-Degnen &amp;
Rosenthal (1990) propose a model of deepening
rapport over time based on the relationship among
three components: positivity, mutual attention and
coordination. As shown in Figure 1, as friendship
deepens, the importance of positivity decreases,
while the importance of coordination increases.
Attention to the conversational partner, however, is
hypothesized to remain constant. That is, strangers
are more likely to be polite and uniformly positive
in their talk, but also more likely to be awkward
and badly coordinated with their interlocutors.
As a relationship progresses and impressions
have been formed and accepted, disagreement be-
comes acceptable and important. This may entail
an increase in face-threatening issues and behav-
iors (cf. Brown &amp; Levinson, 1987) accompanied
by a decrease in the need to mediate these threats.
At this stage in the relationship, coordination be-
comes highly important, so that the conversation
will be less awkward and there is less likelihood of
misunderstanding. Attention to one another, how-
ever, does not change. Tickle-Degnen &amp; Rosenthal
point out that these features are as likely to be ex-
pressed nonverbally (through smiles, nods, and
posture shifts, for example) as verbally.
One criticism of Tickle-Degnen &amp; Rosenthal,
and similar work, is that positive feelings for, and
knowledge about, the other person are not distin-
guished (Cappella, 1990). That is, what might be
perceived as lack of rapport could actually be a
lack of familiarity with a partner’s behavioral cues
for indicating misunderstanding or requesting in-
formation.
This conflation may come from the fact that the
word rapport is used both to refer to the phenome-
non of instant responsiveness (“we just clicked”)
and that of deepening interdependence over time.
ECA research has been divided between a focus on
instant rapport (Gratch et al., 2006; Maatman,
Gratch, &amp; Marsella, 2005) and a focus on estab-
lishing and maintaining relationships over time
(Bickmore &amp; Picard, 2005; Cassell &amp; Bickmore,
2002; Stronks, Nijholt, van der Vet, &amp; Heylen,
2002). Perhaps due to difficulties with analyzing
dyadic interdependent processes, and modeling
them in computational systems, much of the work
in both traditions still takes a signaling approach,
whereby particular signals (such as nodding or
small talk) demonstrate the responsiveness, extro-
version, or rapport-readiness of the agent, but are
decontextualized from the actions of the dyad
(Duncan, 1990). Although this approach is well
paired to current technological constraints, it may
not adequately account for the contingency of in-
terpersonal interaction and conversation. In addi-
tion, in none of these previous studies was there a
focus on how verbal and nonverbal devices actu-
ally change over the course of a relationship, and
how those devices are interdependent between
speaker and listener. An instant rapport approach is
useful for building systems that are initially attrac-
tive to users; but a system that signals increasing
familiarity and intimacy through its linguistic and
nonverbal behaviors may encourage users to stay
with the system over a longer period of time.
In the current work, we concentrate how dis-
course and nonverbal behavior changes over time,
and across the dyad, as this perspective allows us
to highlight the similarities between interpersonal
coordination and knowledge coordination of the
kind that has been studied in both conversational
analysis and psycholinguistics.
Work on conversational analysis demonstrates
the importance of knowledge coordination compo-
nents such as turn-taking and adjacency pairs
(e.g.Goodwin, 1981; Schegloff &amp; Sacks, 1973).
Inspired by this approach, work by Clark and col-
laborators on grounding and conversation as joint
action has made demonstrated coordination and
cooperation as defining characteristics of conversa-
tion (Clark, 1996; Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991; Clark &amp;
Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986). This work has in turn, re-
ceived a significant amount of attention in compu-
tational linguistics, specifically in the study of dia-
logue (Matheson, Poesio, &amp; Traum, 2000; Nakano,
Reinstein, Stocky, &amp; Cassell, 2003; Traum, 1994;
Traum &amp; Dillenbourg, 1998). To develop a model
of nonverbal grounding, Nakano et al. (2003) stud-

ied people giving directions with respect to a map
placed in between them. In that study, we observed
that when a direction-receiver looked up from the
map while the direction-giver was still giving di-
rections, the giver would initiate grounding behav-
ior such as a repeat or a rephrase.
The literature reviewed above leads us to believe
that there is an integral relationship between social
and knowledge coordination. In this paper, we at-
tempt to draw conclusions about the changes in
social and linguistic coordination over the short-
and long-term in a way that illuminates that poten-
tial relationship, and that is also computationally
viable. In order to do this, we replicate the task we
used in our earlier grounding study (Nakano et al.,
2003); that is we use a direction-giving task, where
half the subjects can see one another, and half are
divided by a screen. Here, however, half of the
subjects in each visibility condition are friends and
half are strangers. And to study the potential de-
velopment of rapport across the experimental pe-
riod, each pair performs three subsequent direc-
tion-giving tasks.
In the next section, we discuss the experimental
procedure further. In section 4, we introduce first
steps towards a new computational model of rap-
port that incorporates conversational coordination
and grounding, based on our empirical findings.

3.1 Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992368409090909">
Participants We collected eight task-based con-
versations (N = 16): in each dyad, one participant
was accompanied by the experimenter and fol-
lowed a specific route from one place in the rococo
university building where the experiment was run
to another place in the building. S/he gave the
other participant directions on how to reach that
location, without the use of maps or other props.
The direction-receiver (Receiver) was instructed to
ask the direction-giver (Giver) as many questions
as needed to understand the directions. After the
conversation, the Receiver had to find the location.
During recruitment the Giver was always selected
as someone familiar with the building, while the
Receiver was unfamiliar. All subjects were under-
graduate students, and were motivated by surprise
gifts hidden at the target location.
Design. We manipulated long-term rapport, visi-
bility, and subsequent route in a 2 x 2 x 3 design.
We operationalized long-term rapport as a binary,
between-subjects variable, with conditions Friends
(self-reported as friends for at least one year) and
Strangers. To study the effect of non-verbal behav-
ior, we manipulated visibility as a second between-
subject variable. To do this, half of the participants
could see each other, and half were separated by a
dividing panel. To study the effect of acquaintance
across the experimental period, each dyad com-
pleted the task three consecutive times, going to
three different locations.
Data Coding All dyads were videotaped using a
six-camera array, capturing the participants’ body
movements from the front, side, and above, along
with close-up views of their faces. From each
dyad, we made time-aligned transcriptions (using
Praat). Non-verbal behavior was coded using An-
vil. From the transcripts, the following 9 DAMSL
Dialogue Acts (Core &amp; Allen, 1997) were coded:
Acknowledgments, Answers, Assert, Completion,
Influence, Information Request, Reassert, Repeat-
Rephrase, and Signal Non Understanding. Non-
verbal behavior in giver and receiver was coded
using the following categories, based on Nakano,
et al. (2003):

We first provide basic statistics on the experimen-
tal manipulations and then examine the role of
friendship and visibility on verbal and non-verbal
behavior.
Basic Statistics: Overall, we find that Friend dy-
ads use a significantly greater number of turns per
minute than Strangers (t(6)= 2.45, p&lt;.05, two tail),
however, there is no difference in the mean num-
ber of seconds it took for dyads to complete the
task. This lack of significance may have been due
to variance among the dyads, since the mean
length was 847 seconds for friends and 1049 for

strangers. Given the instructional nature of the
task, this means that Friends were more likely to
intervene in the direction-giving than were Strang-
ers, even though – for most of the dyads – friends
appear to take less time to finish. No difference
was found in turns per minute for Visible and Non-
visible dyads; nor is there a difference in length in
seconds. For routes, there is no difference in turns
per minute, however for the length of the route in
seconds there is a difference (F(2,21)=10.66;
p&lt;.006) such that the mean length of Route 1 is
165 seconds; Route 2 is 395 seconds; Route 3 is
387. For this reason, all statistics below are nor-
malized as a function of the length of that dyad’s
data in seconds, and graphs are plotted to show
least squares mean.
Verbal and Nonverbal behavior: We examine
the relationship between friendship and visibility
of both Giver and Receiver across the three route
tasks. Each of the DAMSL dialogue act variables
and Non-verbal behavior variables was entered as
the dependent variable in building mixed method
models using the JMP statistical package (Version
6, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989-2005);
Speaker (direction-giver or receiver), Visibility,
Friendship and Route were entered as predictor
variables; experimental dialogue number was also
entered as a source of random variance. We report
the results in Tables 1 and 2 (for DAMSL and
Non-verbal behavior variables respectively).
Verbal Behavior: In terms of overall variance ex-
plained, we find that Acknowledgments is best
accounted for by the model (Adjusted R Square of
0.91), whilst Completion is least well accounted
for (Adjusted R2 of 0.06).
Turning first to main effects, for Visibility,
Visible-Givers use Acknowledgements, Assert,
Influence, and Reassert dialogue acts more fre-
quently than Non-visible Givers (post-hoc t tests at
p &lt;.05)
Visible-Receivers use Acknowledgement, Re-
peat-rephrase, Signal Non Understanding these
features more frequently than Non-visible Receiv-
ers. (post-hoc t tests at p &lt;.05)
For Friendship, no differences were found for
production of DAMSL acts by givers. For receiv-
ers, receiver-strangers use more acknowledge-
ments than receiver friends.

These main effects are mediated by an interac-
tion between Visibility×Friendship for Acknowl-
edgements. Here, as shown in Figure 2 and 3 we
see that in the nonvisibility condition, there is no
difference in the use of acknowledgements per
second between friends and strangers; on the other
hand, strangers use more acknowledgements in the
visible condition (p&lt;.05). A very similar interac-
tion was found for Signal Non Understanding (at
the trend level of p&lt;.08).

threatening, this result may indicate that both
friends and strangers become more comfortable
with one another by the third route.
Nonverbal Behavior: Variance explained by the
non-verbal models is the greatest for Look At
Speaker (Adjusted R2 0.83) and least for Speaker
Nod (0.38). With respect to the main effects result-
ing from the analysis of the non-verbal behaviors,
we find the following.
Visibility: Givers nod more in the visible condi-
tion when the receiver is speaking than they do in
the Non-visible condition.
Route: For both givers and receivers, there is an
increase in use of Look At Speaker and Look At
Hearer, over time; in both cases significantly
greater instances of these variables occurred during
Route task 2 and 3, compared to Route 1. Once
again, these results may indicate increasing coor-
dination in conversational behavior for both
Friends and Strangers.
In fact, in the case of head nods, we note an in-
teresting pattern of coordination between speaker
and hearer head-nods across the routes that differs
for friends and strangers. For friends, both Re-
ceiver and Giver head nods in response to Receiver
talk reduce in frequency between the first and sec-
ond routes (Giver t(8)=-2.36; p&lt;0.05; Receiver
t(8)=-2.28; p&lt;0.05). For strangers, no such ac-
commodation over time occurs. Conversely, for
friends when the Giver is speaking, both giver and
receiver head nods increase over the three routes
(significant only for Receiver t(8)=2.38; p&lt;0.05).
For strangers, however, head nods decrease (Giver
t(8)=-2.80; p&lt;0.05, Receiver t(8)=3.92; p&lt;0.01).
This means that speaker and hearer are increas-
ingly coordinated across the routes, particularly
when they are friends.
Interaction of verbal and nonverbal behavior
So far we have concentrated on how individual
verbal and nonverbal behaviors differ across con-
ditions. However, this does not take account of the
interactive nature of the task and the focus of this
paper. We therefore examine how specific respon-
sive nonverbal behaviors (looking at
speaker/hearer and head nods) co-occur before,
during, or after the DAMSL variables. Examina-
tion of the residuals of chi square analysis was
used to identify co-occurrence of DAMSL dia-
logue acts with nonverbal behavior for each
Speaker (Giver or Receiver) and condition
(Friend/Stranger, Visible /Nonvisible). Significant
over-use or underuse of these verbal/nonverbal co-
occurrences was then compared using the log-
likelihood statistic (Rayson, 2003) to dialogues in
the other conditions (e.g., Giver-Friend-Visible
with Giver-Friend-Nonvisible, and Giver-Stranger-
Visible for Head-nods, and just Friends with
Strangers for the Gaze data). This technique, which
we used in our earlier grounding experiment
(Nakano et al., 2003) allows us insight into the
probable causality of the behaviors of speaker and
hearer, across verbal and nonverbal behavior.
When direction-givers are speaking
Head-nods. Givers did not nod significantly more
or less frequently across Friends/Strangers condi-
tions when they were speaking.
Gaze. More than in friendship dialogues, when
strangers are speaking, and the direction-giver is
acknowledging, the direction-receiver is likely to
look at the Giver (G2=17.14; p&lt;0.0001).
More than in friendship dialogues, in Stranger
dialogues, both before and after the direction-giver
asserts something, the Receiver is likely to look at
the Giver (G2=5.09; p&lt;0.05, and G2=4.16, p&lt;0.05,
respectively).
More than in friendship dialogues, both before
and during the Giver’s use of Repeat-Rephrase
utterances, the Receiver is likely to look at the
Giver (G2=35.02; p&lt;0.0001, and G2=60.74;
p&lt;0.0001, respectively).
More than in friendship dialogues, both before
and during the Giver’s use of Info-Request dia-
logue acts, the Receiver is likely to look at the
Giver (G2=39.01; p&lt;0.0001, and G2=9.60; p&lt;0.01,
respectively).
This means that right after a direction receiver
looks at the direction-giver, the giver produces an
Assertion, a Repeat-Rephrase, or an Information

Request. As with Nakano et al., the stranger’s gaze
towards the direction-giver can be seen as a signal
of non-understanding and, in these contexts, it
evokes one of these three grounding responses
from the direction-giver.
For friends, on the other hand, gaze towards the
speaker evokes the next segment of the directions,
and is therefore functioning as a signal of under-
standing. That is, more than in stranger dialogues,
both before and during the Giver’s use of Influence
dialogue acts (utterances such as “turn right”), Re-
ceivers are more to look at the Giver (G2=4.77;
p&lt;0.05, and G2=31.92; p&lt;0.0001, respectively).
When direction-receivers are speaking
Head-nods. As shown in Figure 4, Strangers used
more head nods than Friends during their use of
Acknowledgment dialogue acts in the visible con-
dition (G2 = 10.48, p&lt;.01), however they do not
differ from friends in the nonvisible condition (G2
= 0.01, ns).

Conversely, as shown in Figure 5, when receiv-
ers are making an Info-Request in the visible con-
dition (G2 =14.13, p&lt;.001), Friends nod much more
often than Strangers; but do not differ from Strang-
ers in the nonvisible condition (G2 = 1.44, ns).
Once again, here the friends are marking their un-
derstanding, by nodding, even while they request
further information.
Gaze. Before the Receiver’s use of Acknowl-
edgment dialogue acts in Stranger dialogues, the
Giver is more likely to look at the Receiver
(G2=10.79; p&lt;0.01). After the Receiver has used an
Acknowledgment in a Stranger dialogue, s/he is
more likely to look at the Giver a (G2=14.79;
p&lt;0.001). This means that among strangers the
giver and receiver are likely to engage in mutual
gaze around the acknowledgement dialogue act.
During and after a Repeat-Rephrase dialogue act
in Friends dialogues, the Receiver is more likely to
look at the Giver (G2=10.37; p&lt;0.01 and G2=6.72;
p&lt;0.01, respectively). Before the Receiver uses a
Repeat-Rephrase dialogue act in a Friends dia-
logues, the Giver is more likely to look at the Re-
ceiver (G2=9.08; p&lt;0.01). This means that among
friends, giver and receiver engage in mutual gaze
around the repeat and rephrase dialogue act.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722333333333">
With respect to the co-ordination of verbal and
nonverbal behavior, it is apparent that, among
strangers, the Receiver’s use of Acknowledgments
is strongly associated with characteristic gaze pat-
terns of signaling non-understanding. In these
Stranger dyads, the Giver looks at the Receiver to
signal the need for feedback. The Receiver then
nods to emphasize comprehension while uttering
the Acknowledgment (e.g., “okay”), and then looks
back at the Giver. This pattern is very specific to
Strangers, and in the case of the Receiver’s use of
head nod, specific to the visible condition. Simi-
larly, among strangers, when the Giver acknowl-
edges the receiver’s correct understanding, the Re-
ceiver looks at the Giver. This pattern of gaze re-
quest, and grounding response, happens repeatedly
and often (Acknowledgements being used more
frequently by strangers), ensuring coordination
among strangers, but at the cost of frequent explicit
requests. Of course, since Acknowledgements are
generally backchannel utterances, used to indicate

mutual understanding, one explanation for the
higher frequency of acknowledgements, head nods
and eye gaze by strangers, especially in the earlier
tasks, is over-generation aimed at showing atten-
tion. Although over-generation could achieve these
goals, it can also result in creating a false impres-
sion of mutual understanding and it is notable that
these behaviors decrease over time.
We also find that in the Strangers condition, Re-
ceivers are more likely to look at the Giver before
and during the Giver’s use of Repeat-Rephrase
(i.e., repeating back to the Receiver some earlier
information), and also before and during the
Giver’s use of Info-Request acts (that is the Giver
asking the Receiver a question such as “do you get
that?”).
From the frequent and repeated use of Acknowl-
edgments and gaze (implying something like
“okay... are you sure you’re okay... really?”), to
the Receiver’s gaze-anticipation of the Giver’s Re-
peat-Rephrase and Info-Request, we infer a much
more effortful interaction for Strangers, and one
that, in fact, for most dyads, takes longer.
In line with Welji and Duncan (2005), we found
evidence that the task may demand additional cog-
nitive resources for Strangers, with the Receiver in
the Strangers dialogues breaking gaze at the Giver
to apparently consult some internal representation
of the space just described by the Givers Assert
(e.g., “you’ll find some blue couches”), before re-
turning attention, and gaze, once again to the
Giver.
We also note a greater use overall of Acknowl-
edgment and Completions by Strangers and in
visible situations; Receivers in the visible situa-
tions also use more Signal Non Understanding.
Taken together, these findings indicate that coordi-
nation and achieving mutual understanding is more
effortful for Strangers: Friends use fewer dialogue
acts such as Acknowledgment, Completion, and
Signal Non Understanding, indicating that there is
less need to negotiate understanding, and that they
are more likely to have some kind of shared repre-
sentation. Because of this, the Friends dialogues
and task performance would appear to be more
efficient, with less grounding required and less mu-
tual gaze around their use of Acknowledgments,
Info-Requests and Repeat-Rephrase.
The fact that Friends are better able to calibrate
the task than Strangers is also demonstrated by the
results found for Route. Both Friend and Stranger
dyads increase their gaze towards one another from
Route 1 to Route 2. But Friends shift the way they
use head nods over the course of the three routes.
They begin in Route 1 by producing them in con-
junction with Receiver talk (acknowledgment, re-
quest for further information, repeating directions
back). However, by Route 2, the friends are nod-
ding when the direction-giver speaks, marking that
they don’t need further information but have un-
derstood on the first try. On the contrary, Strangers
continue to nod just as much with receiver talk,
and decrease their nods with giver talk; perhaps
since by Route 2, it is clear that Strangers don’t
understand on the first try.
Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal (1990) predict
greater coordination as a relationship progresses.
We found better coordination, but that was re-
vealed, paradoxically, through fewer coordination
devices and fewer dialogue acts in each turn, both
comparing from Route 1 to Route 3, and compar-
ing Strangers to Friends.

In the Friends dialogues, we find a notable col-
location of non-verbal behavior and the Receiver’s
use of Repeat-Rephrase utterance (i.e., repeating
the Giver’s utterance back to ensure correct inter-
pretation). This is in contrast to the findings for
Stranger dyads which found nonverbal behaviors
found in conjunction with the Giver’s reactive use
of Repeat-Rephrase – i.e., the Giver’s questioning
of the Receiver’s understanding – perhaps after a
breakdown in mutual understanding. In the Friend
dyads, it is the Receiver who proactively checks
correct understanding of the Giver’s utterance be-
fore the interaction continues.
Tickle-Degnen &amp; Rosenthal predict a reduction
in the importance of positivity as rapport increases
over time in a relationship. We found some evi-
dence to support this, since such questioning of the
Giver in itself may be viewed as face-threatening
behavior. However, in the Friends dialogues, this
Repeat-Rephrase appears anticipated – or sanc-
tioned – by the Giver who looks at the Receiver
prior to the utterance. Further, during and after the
Receivers’ use of the Repeat-Rephrase utterance,
they also look at the Giver, which again would be
expected to be viewed as a threat to face.
Similarly, the Receiver gazes at the Giver before
and during the Giver’s use of Influence dialogue
acts (explicit commands, such as “turn left”). Such

direct gaze, along with a reduced number of medi-
ating dialogue acts such as Acknowledgments, ap-
pears to indicate that Friends dialogues are less
concerned with avoiding face-threatening behav-
ior, and as such would appear less concerned with
maintaining positivity during the interaction.
Note that, almost paradoxically, Friends demon-
strate their increased ability to coordinate their in-
teraction through a diminished use of explicit co-
ordination devices. This speeds up the interaction,
and reduces the number of overall dialogue acts.
And, finally, differences between Friends and
Strangers are vastly diminished when the interlocu-
tors cannot see one another. This leads us to be-
lieve that nonverbal behaviors in addition to gaze
and head nods may be playing a role in how
Friends coordinate with one another; an advantage
which is taken away when they can only hear one
another’s voices.

4 Towards a Computational Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991625">
In the short-term context of conversation, mainte-
nance of mutual attention and incremental coordi-
nation of beliefs are requisites for grounding and
turn-taking. In prior computational systems,
grounding has been achieved by marking the status
of conversational contributions as provisional (un-
grounded) or shared (grounded). Conversational
actions by either the user or the system can trigger
updates that change provisional information to
shared. Acknowledgements, for example, are ex-
plicit ways of achieving grounding, but moving on
to the next stage of the task is equally effective, as
it presupposes that prior utterances have been
taken up (Traum, 1994). In a model such as this,
grounding occurs at the turn level. In order to han-
dle the multimodal phenomena that participate in
grounding in face-to-face conversation, as Nakano
et al. (Nakano et al., 2003) have shown, a model of
knowledge coordination needs to have more fre-
quently updated access to potential grounding
events. In that implementation, we continuously
polled for inputs, so as to capture the updates in
grounding that occur between typical linguistic
segments. We believe that the focus on time and
process that allowed us to look at events of a
smaller granularity in our earlier work on nonver-
bal grounding behavior will also allow us to extend
up to events of a larger granularity, such as stages
in a relationship. That is, we believe that the results
described in earlier sections of this paper can be
taken into account in a computational system by
maintaining a model of the state of shared and pri-
vate information across several interactions (sev-
eral years, if possible). In this way, the shared his-
tory of two interlocutors (the user and the system)
can be translated into patterns of linguistic behav-
ior, such as reduced use of acknowledgements, and
reduced positivity, with increased interruption and
information requests. This is similar to Cheng,
Cavedon &amp; Dale (2004)’s approach to direction-
giving. In this approach, the system maintains a
history of places it has given directions to before.
Using this task history, it is able to generate shorter
directions at later stages in the dialogue. In our im-
plementation, however, the very style of the inter-
action is modified by the shared history of the user
and the system. In the sense that we are modifying
the linguistic style of the dialogue based on psy-
chological attributes, our approach is similar to
work by Mairesse &amp; Walker (2007) and Isard et al.
(2006). In both cases, a broad set of natural lan-
guage generation parameters is employed to gener-
ate language that differs along a personality di-
mension, based on a number of previous empirical
studies. In the current approach, however, the fea-
tures that are modified derive from the interde-

pendence of the system with a particular user.
Some of the features that are present in the con-
versations of friends, such as interjections and
completion of one another’s utterances, are still
beyond current computational abilities, as they
would require online, real-time processing and un-
derstanding of utterances with incremental plan-
ning and generation of responses. We are inter-
ested in pursuing this feature of the system as dia-
logue technologies improve.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989636363636">
In this paper, we have compared direction-
giving between friends and strangers, and within
these two groups we have compared three subse-
quent direction-giving episodes. In order to deter-
mine the effect played specifically by nonverbal
behavior in short- and long-term rapport, half of
our participants could see one another, while the
other half were divided by a screen. Our experi-
mental and analytic methodology drew from both
the social psychological, conversational analysis,
and conversation as joint action traditions. Conse-
quently, our results were able to demonstrate the
ways in which the verbal and nonverbal devices
that index rapport relate to the role those same de-
vices play in knowledge coordination. Based on
this commonality, we proposed a computationally
viable model of deepening friendship within and
across subsequent tasks that extends our previous
work on grounding in face-to-face interaction. The
work we have presented here therefore differs sub-
stantially from previous work on rapport and rela-
tionship building in embodied conversational
agents. We did not start out with a definition of
rapport but instead investigated those behaviors
that characterize dyads who have self-identified as
friends or strangers. And rather than looking at
rapid assessment of rapport (the feeling of “click-
ing”) we looked at the long-term version: acquiring
a sense of mutual interdependence. Finally, rather
than looking at how to get ECAs to engage users
into establishing a relationship, or into letting
down their guard, we examined those behaviors
that characterize the dyadic interaction at each
stage.
All of these topics, however, are clearly inter-
related, and future research will benefit from tak-
ing a greater number of them into account in both
data analysis, and the implementation of ECAs.
Future research in our own lab will also have to be
more explicit about how to implement the compu-
tational model that we have started to lay out here.
Additional subjects in a similar experiment will no
doubt facilitate that task.
As we increasingly understand better how con-
versation changes when people come to know one
another, we expect to apply these results to our
ongoing research on virtual peers that can teach
children with autism how to sustain interpersonal
relationships (Tartaro &amp; Cassell, 2006) and to our
work on building the survey interviewers of the
future, who can both engage their survey-takers
and keep them honest (Cassell &amp; Miller, in press).
More generally, however, we hope to increasingly
implement ECAs who will stick around for the
long haul.

Analysis focused on differences in the use of dialogue acts and non-verbal behaviors, as well as cooccurrences of dialogue acts, eye gaze and head nods, and found a pattern of verbal and nonverbal behavior that differentiates the dialogue of friends from that of strangers, and differentiates early acquaintances from those who have worked together before.

Attention to the conversational partner, however, is hypothesized to remain constant. That is, strangers are more likely to be polite and uniformly positive in their talk, but also more likely to be awkward and badly coordinated with their interlocutors. As a relationship progresses and impressions have been formed and accepted, disagreement becomes acceptable and important. This may entail an increase in face-threatening issues and behaviors (cf.

The current study is a part of a larger research program into linguistic and social coordination devices from the utterance level to the relationship level – how they work in humans, how they can be modeled in virtual humans, and how virtual humans can be used to teach people who wish to learn these skills. 2 Background &amp; Theory As people become closer, their conversational style changes. They may raise more topics in the course of a conversation, refer more to themselves as a single unit than as two people, and be more responsive to one another’s talk (Cassell &amp; Tversky, 2005; Hornstein, 1982). They also are likely to sustain eye contact longer, smile more, and lean more towards one another (Grahe &amp; Bernieri, 1999; Richmond &amp; McCroskey, 1995). In addition, friends appear to have fewer difficulties with lexical search, perhaps because they can rely on greater shared knowledge, and are more likely to talk at the same time, and to negotiate turn-taking in a less rigid manner, both through gaze and ges41 Proceedings of the Workshop on Embodied Language Processing, pages 41–50, Prague, Czech Republic, June 28, 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Earl</context>

To study the effect of acquaintance across the experimental period, each dyad completed the task three consecutive times, going to three different locations. Data Coding All dyads were videotaped using a six-camera array, capturing the participants’ body movements from the front, side, and above, along with close-up views of their faces. From each dyad, we made time-aligned transcriptions (using Praat). Non-verbal behavior was coded using Anvil. From the transcripts, the following 9 DAMSL Dialogue Acts (Core &amp; Allen, 1997) were coded: Acknowledgments, Answers, Assert, Completion, Influence, Information Request, Reassert, RepeatRephrase, and Signal Non Understanding. Nonverbal behavior in giver and receiver was coded using the following categories, based on Nakano, et al. (2003): • Look at Speaker – looking at the speaker’s eyes, eye region or face. • Look at Hearer – looking at the hearer’s eyes, eye region or face. • Head nod [speaker or hearer] – Head moves up and down in a single continuous movement on a vertical axis, but eyes do not go above the horizontal axis. 3.2 Results We first provide basic statistic</context>

Perhaps due to difficulties with analyzing dyadic interdependent processes, and modeling them in computational systems, much of the work in both traditions still takes a signaling approach, whereby particular signals (such as nodding or small talk) demonstrate the responsiveness, extroversion, or rapport-readiness of the agent, but are decontextualized from the actions of the dyad (Duncan, 1990). Although this approach is well paired to current technological constraints, it may not adequately account for the contingency of interpersonal interaction and conversation. In addition, in none of these previous studies was there a focus on how verbal and nonverbal devices actually change over the course of a relationship, and how those devices are interdependent between speaker and listener. An instant rapport approach is useful for building systems that are initially attractive to users; but a system that signals increasing familiarity and intimacy through its linguistic and nonverbal beha</context>

That is, what might be perceived as lack of rapport could actually be a lack of familiarity with a partner’s behavioral cues for indicating misunderstanding or requesting information. This conflation may come from the fact that the word rapport is used both to refer to the phenomenon of instant responsiveness (“we just clicked”) and that of deepening interdependence over time. ECA research has been divided between a focus on instant rapport (Gratch et al., 2006; Maatman, Gratch, &amp; Marsella, 2005) and a focus on establishing and maintaining relationships over time (Bickmore &amp; Picard, 2005; Cassell &amp; Bickmore, 2002; Stronks, Nijholt, van der Vet, &amp; Heylen, 2002).

From each dyad, we made time-aligned transcriptions (using Praat). Non-verbal behavior was coded using Anvil. From the transcripts, the following 9 DAMSL Dialogue Acts (Core &amp; Allen, 1997) were coded: Acknowledgments, Answers, Assert, Completion, Influence, Information Request, Reassert, RepeatRephrase, and Signal Non Understanding. Nonverbal behavior in giver and receiver was coded using the following categories, based on Nakano, et al. (2003): • Look at Speaker – looking at the speaker’s eyes, eye region or face. • Look at Hearer – looking at the hearer’s eyes, eye region or face. • Head nod [speaker or hearer] – Head moves up and down in a single continuous movement on a vertical axis, but eyes do not go above the horizontal axis. 3.2 Results We first provide basic statistics on the experimental manipulations and then examine the role of friendship and visibility on verbal and non-verbal behavior.

In that implementation, we continuously polled for inputs, so as to capture the updates in grounding that occur between typical linguistic segments. We believe that the focus on time and process that allowed us to look at events of a smaller granularity in our earlier work on nonverbal grounding behavior will also allow us to extend up to events of a larger granularity, such as stages in a relationship.

They may raise more topics in the course of a conversation, refer more to themselves as a single unit than as two people, and be more responsive to one another’s talk (Cassell &amp; Tversky, 2005; Hornstein, 1982). They also are likely to sustain eye contact longer, smile more, and lean more towards one another (Grahe &amp; Bernieri, 1999; Richmond &amp; McCroskey, 1995).

In the current work, we concentrate how discourse and nonverbal behavior changes over time, and across the dyad, as this perspective allows us to highlight the similarities between interpersonal coordination and knowledge coordination of the kind that has been studied in both conversational analysis and psycholinguistics. Work on conversational analysis demonstrates the importance of knowledge coordination components such as turn-taking and adjacency pairs (e.g.Goodwin, 1981; Schegloff &amp; Sacks, 1973). Inspired by this approach, work by Clark and collaborators on grounding and conversation as joint action has made demonstrated coordination and cooperation as defining characteristics of conversation (Clark, 1996; Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991; Clark &amp; Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986).

They begin in Route 1 by producing them in conjunction with Receiver talk (acknowledgment, request for further information, repeating directions back). However, by Route 2, the friends are nodding when the direction-giver speaks, marking that they don’t need further information but have understood on the first try. On the contrary, Strangers continue to nod just as much with receiver talk, and decrease their nods with giver talk; perhaps since by Route 2, it is clear that Strangers don’t understand on the first try. Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal (1990) predict greater coordination as a relationship progresses. We found better coordination, but that was revealed, paradoxically, through fewer coordination devices and fewer dialogue acts in each turn, both comparing from Route 1 to Route 3, and comparing Strangers to Friends. Friends – Positivity In the Friends dialogues, we find a notable collocation of non-verbal behavior and the Receiver’s use of Repeat-Rephrase utterance (i.e., repeating the Giver’s utterance back to ensure correct interpretation).

From the frequent and repeated use of Acknowledgments and gaze (implying something like “okay... are you sure you’re okay... really?”), to the Receiver’s gaze-anticipation of the Giver’s Repeat-Rephrase and Info-Request, we infer a much more effortful interaction for Strangers, and one that, in fact, for most dyads, takes longer. In line with Welji and Duncan (2005), we found evidence that the task may demand additional cognitive resources for Strangers, with the Receiver in the Strangers dialogues breaking gaze at the Giver to apparently consult some internal representation of the space just described by the Givers Assert (e.g., “you’ll find some blue couches”), before returning attention, and gaze, once again to the Giver. We also note a greater use overall of Acknowledgment and Completions by Strangers and in visible situations; Receivers in the visible situations also use more Signal Non Understanding.
