This paper addresses a novel task of se-
mantically analyzing the comparative con-
structions inherent in attributive superla-
tive expressions against structured knowl-
edge bases (KBs). The task can be de-
fined in two-fold: first, selecting the com-
parison dimension against a KB, on which
the involved items are compared; and sec-
ond, determining the ranking order, in
which the items are ranked (ascending or
descending). We exploit Wikipedia and
Freebase to collect training data in an un-
supervised manner, where a neural net-
work model is then learnt to select, from
Freebase predicates, the most appropriate
comparison dimension for a given superla-
tive expression, and further determine its
ranking order heuristically. Experimen-
tal results show that it is possible to learn
from coarsely obtained training data to
semantically characterize the comparative
constructions involved in attributive su-
perlative expressions.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999513794117647">
Superlatives are fairly common in natural lan-
guages and play an essential role in daily commu-
nications, when in conveying comparisons among
a set of items or degrees of certain properties.
Properly analyzing superlative expressions holds
the promise for many applications such as ques-
tion answering (QA), text entailment, sentiment
analysis and so on. In literature, analysis of
superlatives has drawn more interests from both
formal linguistics and semantics(Szabolcsi, 1986;
Gawron, 1995; Heim, 1999; Farkas and Kiss,
2000), but relatively less attention from the com-
putational linguistics and NLP communities(Bos
and Nissim, 2006; Jindal and Liu, 2006; Scheible,
2007; Scheible, 2009).
Earlier computational treatments to superlatives
focus on the categorizations of superlatives(Bos
and Nissim, 2006; Scheible, 2009), where the
most common but important type is being part
of a noun phrase or describing certain properties
or attributes of the subjects, named as attribu-
tive superlatives or ISA-superlatives, accounting
for around 90% of appearances in newswire. A
typical example is Nile is the longest river in the
world.
In most cases, the gist behind such superlative
expressions is the comparative constructions that
the utterance intends to convey to readers, e.g., in
the Nile example, Nile is longer than any other
rivers in the world. Semantically understanding
such attributive superlative expressions boils down
to interpreting the comparative construction in-
volved in the utterance in the following four as-
pects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977015294117647">
1. Target: one or more items that work as the
protagonist of the utterance, and are being
compared within the comparative construc-
tion, e.g., Nile;
2. Comparison set: the set of items that are
being compared against in the utterance(Bos
and Nissim, 2006), e.g., all rivers in the
world;
3. Comparison dimension: the attribute or
property that the items are compared upon,
e.g., the length of a river;
4. Ranking order: the order in which the items
in the comparison set are sorted according to
the dimension, in an ascending or descending
order, e.g., we should rank all rivers regard-
ing their lengths in a descending order to get
the longest at the top.

importance of categorizing superlatives, identify-
ing the target and comparison set(Bos and Nissim,
2006; Jindal and Liu, 2006; Scheible, 2009), while
putting less attention on other aspects.
In fact, grounding the comparison dimension
into a canonical predicate of a KB can help pro-
vide more accurate interpretations for the involved
comparative constructions. In question answering
over structured KBs, accurate treatments for su-
perlatives will not only help build more precise of
structured queries, but also support shallow func-
tional reasoning, e.g., formally analyzing the fifth
longest river in the world, will explore the most of
the structured nature of KBs, and is advantageous
to traditional IR based methods.
However, selecting an appropriate comparison
dimension against a structured KB is not a trivial
task. Usually, the numbers of adjective superla-
tives and gradable KB predicates are large, so that
it is impossible to craft mapping rules to cover
every pair of adjective superlative and predicate.
Consequently, preparing wide-coverage annotated
data to help automate this procedure is also labor-
intensive and time consuming. Moreover, some
adjectives are widely used, but often vague to de-
cide a dimension by themselves(Bos and Nissim,
2006). One may need to draw support from their
context and even common sense knowledge.
In this paper, we propose a novel task, se-
mantically interpreting the comparative construc-
tions inherent in attributive superlative expres-
sions again structured KBs, e.g., Freebase(Google,
2013), specifically, focusing on selecting appro-
priate comparison dimensions and corresponding
ranking orders. To this end, we collect training
data from roughly aligned Wikipedia resources
and knowledge facts in Freebase, from which we
build a neural network model to reveal the un-
derlying correspondence between the comparative
construction, as well as its context, and a Freebase
predicate. Our method leverages the potentials of
structured KBs and large amount of text resources
in Wikipedia without relying on human annotated
data.
We evaluate our interpretation of superlatives
in two tasks, and experimental results show that
it is possible to learn the comparison dimensions
in form of canonical knowledge bases predicates
from roughly collected training data, which is
noisy in nature but provides the essentials to se-
mantically characterize superlative expressions.

2 The Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993238095238">
Given a sentence with an attributive superlative ex-
pression, our task is to find on which dimension
the comparison happens against a KB and how the
comparison results are arranged, i.e., (1) Dimen-
sion Selection: decide the dimension on which
the involved items are compared, and ground the
selected dimension into Freebase predicates. (2)
Ranking Order Determination: given the com-
parison set and the selected dimension, determine
the order in which the involved items are ranked
within the comparisons, in an ascending or de-
scending order? For superlatives coupled with or-
dinals, we also need to assign the standing in the
rankings.
In the Nile example, we expect to in-
terpret the longest river into a vector
&lt;fb:geography.river.length, descending, 1&gt;,
where all rivers in the world are compared upon
Freebase predicate fb:geography.river.length,
sorted in a descending order and the referred
target ranks the first.

3 The WikiDiF Dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911333333333">
Previous superlative datasets are built to facili-
tate superlative extraction, classification, and com-
parison set identification(Bos and Nissim, 2006;
Scheible, 2012). There are currently no available
datasets that can be used directly for our task, es-
pecially no annotations against structured KBs.
We therefore present a distantly supervised
method to collect annotated training data from rich
text resources of Wikipedia and the help of Free-
base, without much human involvement. The key
assumption behind our method is that if a superla-
tive expression frequently appears in a context
that may describe a KB predicate, then this predi-
cate probably plays an important role in the com-
parative construction triggered by this superlative.
Inspired by recent advances in relation extrac-
tion(Mintz et al., 2009), given a Freebase predi-
cate, we are able to collect many sentences from
Wikipedia pages, which more or less describe this
predicate, without extra human annotation. These
sentences in turn can be used to collect the co-
occurrences between a superlative expression and
this predicate.
In more detail, we first find all Free-
base predicates that may involve in compara-
tive constructions, i.e., all gradable predicates,
e.g., fb:geography.river.length, on which differ-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990204">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.97506968">
ent rivers can be compared with each other. In
practice, we simply treat all Freebase predicates
that take objects of type E {/type/int, /type/float,
/type/datetime} as gradable predicates. In total,
we collect 8,968,383 &lt;subj, rel, obj&gt; triples cov-
ering all 1,795 gradable predicates from Freebase
dump.
Next, we extract, from Wikipedia pages, all sen-
tences containing superlative expressions, as well
as their f3 context sentences1. To detect superla-
tives, we rely on part-of-speech tags (JJS, RBS)
which can achieve a high recall in practice accord-
ing to (Jindal and Liu, 2006). By doing so, we col-
lect 7,734,006 sentences with superlative expres-
sions from Wikipedia.
Finally, for each collected triple &lt;subj, rel,
obj&gt; , we match subj and obj into our sentence
collection, including those contextual sentences.
This gives us 20,609 sentences with superlative
expressions that potentially describe our collected
knowledge triples with gradable predicates. For
example, the following sentences from the page of
Nile in Wikipedia may describes a Freebase fact
&lt;Nile, fb:geography.river.length, 6,853&gt;:
“The Nile is a major north-flowing river
in northeastern Africa, generally re-
garded as the longest river in the world.
It is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long. ”
where we can see that longest has implied a com-
parative construction among all rivers in the world
and fb:geography.river.length is the involved hid-
den comparison dimension.
Our resulting dataset, WikiDiF, contains 20,609
sentences paired with Freebase predicates, cov-
ering 2,335 superlative words and 340 Freebase
predicates2. In WikiDiF, there are on average 8.8
sentences per superlative word targeting for about
2 predicates, and for commonly seen superlatives,
e.g., largest or biggest, there are on average 70
sentences per superlative word targeting for 30
predicates. Compared to other human annotated
datasets, WikiDiF is admittedly noisy in nature,
1In Wikipedia, sentences with superlative expressions
may not always contain the knowledge facts that support the
superlative constructions, which often appear in their neigh-
bouring sentences. For example, highest, and its supporting
fact, (Everest, 8,848 metres), are not in the same sentence, but
indeed very near: Mount Everest, also known ..., is Earth’s
highest mountain. It is located in ... of the Himalayas. Its
peak is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above sea level.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.588543666666667">
2We also filter out predicates whose objects are very com-
mon in the documents, e.g., 1 or 2, which is difficult to collect
training data.

but exploits the underlying connections between
knowledge facts and their possibly correspond-
ing textual descriptions, where the pseudo co-
occurrences of superlative expressions and Free-
base predicates will work as a proxy for us to for-
mally analyze the involved comparative construc-
tions.

4 Comparison Dimension Selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996148142857143">
Our WikiDiF dataset contains utterances with
roughly annotated superlative-predicate pairs,
which helps us to model the dimension selection
task as a classification problem. Given a superla-
tive word S and its context C, our goal is to find a
gradable Freebase predicate R that maximizes the
conditional probability P(R  |C, S):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991717">
R∗ = arg max P(R  |C, S)
REcandS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989780952381">
where we can limit our search space to a candi-
date set candS according to the domain and type
constraints regarding the comparison set.
Currently, our WikiDiF covers limited predi-
cates and training instances for each superlative S,
traditional classification models may suffer from
the coverage and data sparsity issues. Here, we
adopt a classic one-layer neural network (NN)
model with the help of word embeddings to predict
how likely a predicate R can work as the compar-
ison dimension given S and its context vector.
We start by constructing vector representations
of words and store them in a table L. We use
the publicly available word embeddings trained by
SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011), with 50 dimen-
sions throughout our experiments.
We construct the context vector for each in-
stance by concatenating the vectors of context
words within a window of fk. If there are not
enough words within the window, special filling
vectors will be used.

where jS is the index of superlative S in the sen-
tence, and w is the vector of context word or spe-
cial filling parameter.
The output layer of the NN model is a standard
softmax function, which takes a sigmoid nonlin-
earity of the context vectors as input. Therefore,
the probability of ith predicate in Freebase is cho-
sen as the comparison dimension given superlative
S and its context C can be written as:

5 Ranking Order Determination
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933125">
To exploit the most from a structured KB, we
use an effective heuristic method to decide the
ranking order when a superlative expression 5
triggers a comparative construction regarding a
KB predicate R. For each pair of (5, R), we
first find from R’s supporting sentences the ones
that contain superlative 5, and further trace the
&lt;subj*, R, obj*&gt; tuples from the KB which
these sentences are assumed to describe. We
next look up into the KB, and find other tuples
&lt;subjo, R, objo&gt; with the same predicate R. If
subjo and subj* are of the same type, and most
objo &lt; obj*, we will say the ranking order for ex-
pression 5 is descending when implying predicate
R, otherwise, ascending order.
In the Nile example, if we find in our KB that
nearly all other entities of type river have smaller
values than 6,853 in fb:geography.river.length , we
can conclude that the ranking order for longest re-
garding fb:geography.river.length is descending ,
i.e., we should rank all rivers descendingly to get
the longest one at the top.
Ordinals are processed as a post-processing step
to interpret ordinals into a numerical values.

The main purposes of this work is to answer the
following two questions: (1) can we learn from
noisy training data without much human involve-
ment to semantically interpret attributive superla-
tive expressions via structured KBs? (2) can our
semantic analysis help better understand utter-
ances with superlative expressions?

6.1 Interpreting Superlative Comparisons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950225806452">
We first evaluate our models in the vanilla setup
defined in Section 23, in terms of accuracy of di-
mension selection (Accd), precision of predicates
covered by WikiDiF (Pd), and precision of rank-
ing order determination (Po).
Datasets: We manually annotate superlative ex-
pressions from QALD-4 evaluation dataset(Unger
et al., 2014) and TREC QA (2002, 2003)
datasets(NIST, 2003), and guarantee that all the
labeled superlative instances can be grounded to
gradable Freebase predicates. The resulting ques-
tion dataset contains 135 questions covering 44
Freebase predicates. Additionally, we manu-
ally annotate 77 declarative sentences covering 24
Freebase predicates from WSJ and Wikipedia as
the declarative dataset.
We build a Naive Bayes model using co-
occurrences as a baseline to predict proper dimen-
sions. We further implement a simple baseline to
decide the ranking order, by measuring the relat-
edness between a superlative word and two sets
of seed words using word embeddings. The two
seed sets, {most, more, much, many} and {least,
less, few, little}, potentially indicate two ranking
orders, respectively.
We can see in Table 1 that our method can better
capture the underlying connections between su-
perlative expressions and KB predicates. Com-
paring with the baseline, our model benefits from
the NN architecture and distributional word rep-
resentations and avoids data sparsity to some ex-

tent. Our model achieves over 90% of precision on
the predicates covered by our training data, show-
ing that it is possible to learn from noisy train-
ing data to characterize comparison dimensions
against a KB. However, the relatively lower ac-
curacy is mainly due to that some predicates in
the testing data are not covered by our WikiDiF,
which only covers 19% of gradable Freebase pred-
icates. Regarding the ranking order determination,
our simple heuristic method makes the most of
Freebase triples, and outperforms the relatedness
based baseline, which does not take Freebase into
account.
By looking at the different performances on
question and declarative sentences, we can see
that our method performs better on relatively sim-
pler and shorter questions, while a slightly worse
on longer declarative sentences. This is not sur-
prising, since questions are often simple in struc-
ture and ask for a straightforward property about
the target, while declarative sentences are usu-
ally complicated in syntax, which a ±5 context
words window may not be able to capture. An-
other reason is that for newswire, there are many
predicates that are similar in definitions but with
tiny differences, which often confuse our methods,
e.g., fb:business.business operation.assets and
fb:business.business operation.current assets.

6.2 Question Answering over Freebase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983827586207">
We also investigate how our semantic analysis
for superlatives can help improve question an-
swering on two benchmark datasets, Free917(Cai
and Yates, 2013) and WebQuestions(Berant et al.,
2013), which contain 35 questions with attributive
superlative expressions in total. We inject our for-
mal analysis as superlative-triggered aggregation
operations into an existing system, Xu14(Xu et al.,
2014). Note that we leave the comparison set to
be decided by Xu14’s parser.
The 35 superlative-triggered complex questions
can not be correctly answered by most state-
of-the-art systems(Berant et al., 2013; Yao and
Van Durme, 2014; Xu et al., 2014), since they
can not properly analyze the superlative-triggered
functions. When integrated with our analysis,
Xu14 is able to correctly answer 14 out of 35
such questions (40%), significantly outperform-
ing other systems. The remaining 21 questions
are mainly idiomatic usage, e.g., the Best Actor
Award, or with predicates not covered by WikiDiF.
The result shows that our analysis can help QA
systems better handle superlative-triggered aggre-
gation functions, which previous works fail to do.
This also gives a good reason to introduce the
analysis for comparison constructions into the QA
community, which will leverage the potentials of
structured KBs to better deal with complex ques-
tions.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982470588235">
In this paper, we present a novel attempt to se-
mantically analyze the comparisons involved in
attributive superlative expressions by investigat-
ing on which dimension the comparative construc-
tion works and how the comparison results are ar-
ranged. We leverage Freebase and their roughly
aligned textural descriptions from Wikipedia, and
learn from such training data to characterize a
comparative construction in two aspects, the di-
mension of the comparison and its ranking order.
Currently, our analysis suffers from the limited
coverage of our WikiDiF. In the future, it would be
interesting to improve our method to cover more
KB predicates, and extend our NN model with
more advanced structures to further improve the
performances and also simultaneously character-
ize the target and comparison set involved.

<abstract confidence="0.998513">This paper addresses a novel task of semantically analyzing the comparative constructions inherent in attributive superlative expressions against structured knowledge bases (KBs). The task can be defined in two-fold: first, selecting the comparison dimension against a KB, on which the involved items are compared; and second, determining the ranking order, in which the items are ranked (ascending or descending). We exploit Wikipedia and Freebase to collect training data in an unsupervised manner, where a neural network model is then learnt to select, from Freebase predicates, the most appropriate comparison dimension for a given superlative expression, and further determine its ranking order heuristically. Experimental results show that it is possible to learn from coarsely obtained training data to semantically characterize the comparative constructions involved in attributive superlative expressions.</abstract>

For superlatives coupled with ordinals, we also need to assign the standing in the rankings. In the Nile example, we expect to interpret the longest river into a vector &lt;fb:geography.river.length, descending, 1&gt;, where all rivers in the world are compared upon Freebase predicate fb:geography.river.length, sorted in a descending order and the referred target ranks the first. 3 The WikiDiF Dataset Previous superlative datasets are built to facilitate superlative extraction, classification, and comparison set identification(Bos and Nissim, 2006; Scheible, 2012). There are currently no available datasets that can be used directly for our task, especially no annotations against structured KBs. We therefore present a distantly supervised method to collect annotated training data from rich text resources of Wikipedia and the help of Freebase, without much human involvement. The key assumption behind our method is that if a superlative expression frequently appears in a context that may describe a KB predicate, then this predicate probably plays an important role in the comparative construction triggered by this superlative.

Another reason is that for newswire, there are many predicates that are similar in definitions but with tiny differences, which often confuse our methods, e.g., fb:business.business operation.assets and fb:business.business operation.current assets. 6.2 Question Answering over Freebase We also investigate how our semantic analysis for superlatives can help improve question answering on two benchmark datasets, Free917(Cai and Yates, 2013) and WebQuestions(Berant et al., 2013), which contain 35 questions with attributive superlative expressions in total. We inject our formal analysis as superlative-triggered aggregation operations into an existing system, Xu14(Xu et al., 2014). Note that we leave the comparison set to be decided by Xu14’s parser. The 35 superlative-triggered complex questions can not be correctly answered by most stateof-the-art systems(Berant et al., 2013; Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Xu et al., 2014), since they can not properly analyze the superlative-triggered functions.

Currently, our WikiDiF covers limited predicates and training instances for each superlative S, traditional classification models may suffer from the coverage and data sparsity issues. Here, we adopt a classic one-layer neural network (NN) model with the help of word embeddings to predict how likely a predicate R can work as the comparison dimension given S and its context vector. We start by constructing vector representations of words and store them in a table L. We use the publicly available word embeddings trained by SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011), with 50 dimensions throughout our experiments. We construct the context vector for each instance by concatenating the vectors of context words within a window of fk. If there are not enough words within the window, special filling vectors will be used. V = (w.7S−k, ..., w.7S−1, w.7S+1, ..., w.7S+k) where jS is the index of superlative S in the sentence, and w is the vector of context word or special filling parameter. The output layer of the NN model is a standard softmax function, which takes a sigmoid nonlinearity of the context vectors as input. Therefore, the probability of ith predicate</context>

Consequently, preparing wide-coverage annotated data to help automate this procedure is also laborintensive and time consuming. Moreover, some adjectives are widely used, but often vague to decide a dimension by themselves(Bos and Nissim, 2006). One may need to draw support from their context and even common sense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel task, semantically interpreting the comparative constructions inherent in attributive superlative expressions again structured KBs, e.g., Freebase(Google, 2013), specifically, focusing on selecting appropriate comparison dimensions and corresponding ranking orders. To this end, we collect training data from roughly aligned Wikipedia resources and knowledge facts in Freebase, from which we build a neural network model to reveal the underlying correspondence between the comparative construction, as well as its context, and a Freebase predicate. Our method leverages the potentials of structured KBs and large amount of text resources in Wikipedia without relying on human annotated data.

Next, we extract, from Wikipedia pages, all sentences containing superlative expressions, as well as their f3 context sentences1.

Properly analyzing superlative expressions holds the promise for many applications such as question answering (QA), text entailment, sentiment analysis and so on. In literature, analysis of superlatives has drawn more interests from both formal linguistics and semantics(Szabolcsi, 1986; Gawron, 1995; Heim, 1999; Farkas and Kiss, 2000), but relatively less attention from the computational linguistics and NLP communities(Bos and Nissim, 2006; Jindal and Liu, 2006; Scheible, 2007; Scheible, 2009). Earlier computational treatments to superlatives focus on the categorizations of superlatives(Bos and Nissim, 2006; Scheible, 2009), where the most common but important type is being part of a noun phrase or describing certain properties or attributes of the subjects, named as attributive superlatives or ISA-superlatives, accounting for around 90% of appearances in newswire. A typical example is Nile is the longest river in the world. In most cases, the gist behind such superlative expressions is the comparative constructions that the utterance intends to convey to readers, e.g., in the Nile</context>

So far, there have been only a few computational treatments for superlatives, addressing the 225 Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Short Papers), pages 225–230, Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. c�2015 Association for Computational Linguistics importance of categorizing superlatives, identifying the target and comparison set(Bos and Nissim, 2006; Jindal and Liu, 2006; Scheible, 2009), while putting less attention on other aspects. In fact, grounding the comparison dimension into a canonical predicate of a KB can help provide more accurate interpretations for the involved comparative constructions. In question answering over structured KBs, accurate treatments for superlatives will not only help build more precise of structured queries, but also support shallow functional reasoning, e.g., formally analyzing the fifth longest river in the world, will explore the most of the structured nature of KBs, and is advantageous to traditional IR based methods.

We inject our formal analysis as superlative-triggered aggregation operations into an existing system, Xu14(Xu et al., 2014). Note that we leave the comparison set to be decided by Xu14’s parser. The 35 superlative-triggered complex questions can not be correctly answered by most stateof-the-art systems(Berant et al., 2013; Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Xu et al., 2014), since they can not properly analyze the superlative-triggered functions. When integrated with our analysis, Xu14 is able to correctly answer 14 out of 35 such questions (40%), significantly outperforming other systems. The remaining 21 questions are mainly idiomatic usage, e.g., the Best Actor Award, or with predicates not covered by WikiDiF. The result</context>
