<bodyText confidence="0.999745">
Nowadays it is common the construction of
English understanding systems (interfaces) that soo-
ner or later one has to re-use, adapting and conver
ting them to other natural languages. This is not an
easy task and in many cases the arisen problems are
quite complex. In this paper an experiment that was
accomplished for Portuguese language is reported
and some conclusions are explicitely stated. A know
ledge information processing system, known as SSIPA,
with natural language comprehension capabilities
that interacts with users in Portuguese through a
Portuguese interface, LUSO, was built. Logic was u-
sed as a mental aidand as a practical tool.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998355">
The CHAT-80 program for English (Warren &amp;
Pereira, 1981; Pereira, 1983) was transformed and a
dapted to Portuguese. Logic Programming as a mental
aid, and Prolog (Coelho, 1983; Clocksin &amp; Melish ,
1981) and Extraposition Grammars (Pereira, 1983) as
practical tools, were adopted to implement a natu-
ral language interface for Portuguese. The interfa-
ce here reported, called LUSO, was then coupled to
a knowledge base for geography, an extension of the
CHAT-80 knowledge base. In an ulterior experiment ,
LUSO dictionary was augmented with new vocabulary
and LUSO was coupled to other modules that conside-
rably augmented the expertise capabilities of SSIPA
(Sistema Simulador de um Interlocutor Portuguis Au-
tomatico (2)).
SSIPA is a complex knowledge information processing
system with natural language comprehension and syn-
thesis capabilitites that interacts with users in
Portuguese due to the linguistic knowledge that is
logically organized and codified in the above men-
tioned SSIPA&apos;s interface called LUSO.After the first
step of its development, SSIPA was able to answer

questions about geography and could agree or disa-
gree with the opinions stated by the users about
its geographical knowledge. After the second step
of its development SSIPA became more powerful and
intelligent because it could also perform actions
that traditionally were attributes of computer mo-
nitors (Lopes &amp; Viccari, 1984).As a matteroffact,
SSIPA can create and delete files, fill them,
change their names, list and change their, contents;
SSIPA receives, keeps and send messages
answers questions not only aboutgeographybut
also about the knowledge SSIPA represents; it a -
grees or disagrees with theopinions stated by users
about the Knowledge context behind dialogues,
reacts when users try to cheat it but, as a rule,
SSIPA behaves as a helpful, deligent and cooperati
ve interlocutor willing to serve human users, chan
ging from one to another topic of conversation and
developing intelligent clarification dialogues (Lg
pes, 1984). All these features require a very power
ful Portuguese language interface whosemainmorono
-syntactic features are pointed out in this pa-
per.

2. FORMALIZATION OF NATURAL
LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998396">
Natural language are complex structured
systems difficult to formalize. Formalization can
be understood as a step by step construction of a
theory to achieve , as an ultimate goal, an axioma
tic definition of natural language constructs. If
this descriptive theory can also function as the
linguistic structured knowledge necessary to simu-
late a human native using his mother language then,
the formalization effort has acquired and gained a
new insight. While representing a natural language
system, it may represent a native competence about
his mother language and, simultaneously, itmey per
form the role of a native using that competence.
This dual unity, incorporatinga description of lip
guistic knowledge and incorporating the same lin -
guistic knowledge ready to be active, is central to
this work.This unification in the same unit of two
apparently conflicting and contradi tory aspects of
natural languages is possible due to the usage of
logic as a mental and a practical tool. SSIPA enca
psulates both views of natural language.
Practice demonstrates that, for the cons
truction of complex models it is better to begin
with simple model versions to represent the system
one intends to simulate. This practical conclusion

seems reasonable because knowledge about a system
and about its representation keeps on augmenting as
far as, to achieve the validation of the simula -
ting model, empirical investigationprogresses(Klir,
1975). However one must be aware that while Know -
ledge about a real system keeps on growing so do
the complexitythatonecan unwillingly introduce in
to the model. Having all this in mind, if we want
to formalize linguistic knowledge aboutnatural lan
guage we must be prepared to use powerful formal
languages prone to description of complex systems
and able to be used as programming languages. Here
it is subsumed that computers are tools adapted to
deal with complexity, augmenting considerably hu-
man capabilities to handle highly complex represen
tational systems.

3. LUSO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935628983870968">
LUSO input subsystem is a device that
transforms a sequence of words morfologically, syn
tactically and semantically significant into a Lo-
gical Form. A Logical Form is here understood as a
sequence of predicates, envelopes for knowledge
transportation from users to SSIPA central proces-
sing unit (the EVENT DRIVER) and from this unit to
users. These predicates generalize and augment the
potencialities of Pereira&apos;s equivalent predicates,
(Pereira, 1983). They can also be comparedwith the
lexical functions of Bresnam (1981). However we
don&apos;t use case classification. In Portuguese, pre-
positions associated to noun semanticfeaturesseem
to be enough to identify and differentiate mea-
nings of verbal, noun, adjectival and even preposi
tional form functions (Lopes, 1984).
LUSO is a natural language interface that
concentrates linguistic expert knowledge about Por
tuguese language.
LUSO input subsystem works sequentially.
In a first step it performs the syntactical analy-
sis of an input Portuguese sequence of words. De-
pending on the task LUSO has been commited to per-
form, a lexically filled syntagmatic marker or a
failure is the result of LUSO eagerness to prove
the above mentioned input sequence of words as a
syntactically correct yes-no question, wh-question,
imperative or declarative sentence, or as a syntac
tically correct noun phrase or prepositional phra-
se. When a lexically filled syntagmatic marker is
obtained, it is translated to a logical form. Fi-
nally this form is planned and simplified accor -
ding to the methodology described by Pereira (1983)
and Warren (1981).
The design of LUSO input subsystem re -
flects the following hypothesis:
. morphological analysis of Portuguese
constructs is syntactically driven;
. linguistic semantic analysis of Portu-
guese constructs is lexically (functio
nally) driven (in a quasi-bresnamian,
sense (Bresnam, 1981; Pereira, 1983;Lo
pes, 1984));
. cognitive semantic analysis of Portu -
guese constructs depends on syntacti -
cal and linguistic semantic analysis
previously achieved for Portuguese cons
tructs.
This suggests SSIPA as a formal system
that already theorizes some aspects of Portuguese
language while LUSO specificates the form of for-
mal functions whose cognitive content and formal ap
titude for transforming system state are defined at
the semantic level of the formal system.
To complete the formal role wewanted SSI
PA to play, LUSO output subsystem synthesizes Por-
tuguese noun phrases, prepositional phrases or sen
tences whenever it receives correspondent requests
to output such constructs. To achieve that goal LU
SO transforms any previously lexically filled syn-
tagmatic marker into a sequence of Portuguesewords
in its final forms, ready to be sent to a user.

4. MORPHO-SYNTACTICAL ANALYSIS AND SYNTHE -
SIS OF PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998204">
The morpho-syntactical analysis of Portu
guese language constructs is application indepen -
dent and is based on the various concepts develo-
ped by Chomsky and followers in the framework of
the Extended Standard Theory of Generative Grammar
(Chomsky, 1980, 1981a, 1981b; Rouveret, 1983 and
many others). As it was already mentioned in this
paper, one of the crucial hypothesis behind LUSO&apos;s
design reflects the idea that morphological analy-
sis of Portuguese constructs is syntactically dri-
ven. This means that when the syntactical parser is
waiting for a specific grammatical category, it ta
kes the next word to be analysed from the input se
quence of words and searches the dictionary for that
category, trying to find the input word. If the in
put word does not match any dictionary entry for
that particular category, all possible input word
endings, one after another, starting from the lon-
gest towards ths shortest, are matched against the
ending entries for that category until a success -
ful match will occur. If such a match does not suc
ceed, this means that the input word does not be-
long to the foreseen grammatical category. As a con
sequence, a failure occurs and the Prolog mecha -
nism for backtracking is automatically activated.
When one of the input word possible endings mat -
ches an ending entry for the syntactically predic-
ted category, a basic form for the input word is
coined. The newly coined basic form for that in -
put word is then checked against the subdictionary
entries for the foreseen grammatical category.A pro
cess of successes and/or failures proceeds. A syn-
tagmatic marker for each input Portugueseconstruct
is filled with word basic forms and correspon -
dingsyntactic features information (person, gender
and number for noun phrases; tense, mode, aspect ,
voice and negation for verbs; etc.). The basic form
fora-verb is its infinitive form; for a noun is its
singular form; for a pronoun, article or adjective
is its singular masculine form.

The morphological synthesis of Portugue-
se constructs is syntactically driven. This means
that, departing from a syntagmatic marker lexical-
15/ filled with basic forms of Portuguese words, u-
sing the syntactic features that are explicitelly
considered into that marker, LUSO output subsystem
comes the corresponding sequence of Portuguese
words in its final output form ready to be sent to
the user with whom the system is interacting. For
this purpose most of theruTesthat were designed
to consult LUSO&apos;s dictionary were reordered. Depar
ting from basic forms of words, their final forms
are obtained by a process nearly inverse of the
process used for input.
Extraposition grammars, the formalism de
veloped by Pereira (1983), were used to implement
the analyser and the synthesizer for Portuguese.It
is worth telling that this formalism proved to be
quite adequate for the description of move-alpha ru
le (Chomsky, 1981b) in complex syntactical environ
ments such as those that frequently occur in Portu
guese. As a matter of fact phrase constituents or-
der in Portuguese sentences is quite free. LUSO ta
kes into account the same type of problems handled
by CHAT-80 program. Additionally, it analysis syn-
tactical structures involving prepositional phra -
ses and verb headed sentences where there is reor-
dering of noun phrase constituents inside those se
tences due to the heading process. Problems rela-
ted to common nouns followed by the proper nouns
they refer, in the context where they appear,is al
so handled.

5. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999503517241379">
It is wiser to concentrate efforts to ob
tam n more and more powerful morpho-syntactic analy
sers, linguistic semantic analysers and cognitive,
semantic interpreters for the natural language we
are working in. Constructing replicants of applica
tion directed interfaces starting from scratch is
unproductive. Constructing more and more powerful
interfaces, as the number of applications natural-
ly grows, the natural language analyser, planned to
be application independent, is always under impro-
vement because it is always incorporating more and
more linguistic knowledge. At the same time one is
freed from consideration of morphological and syn-
tactic basic problems and so one can shift his at-
tention to more subtle problems related to tense ,
modality and others and one can concentrate his
mind to the way how concepts related to words are
defined. As a consequence, the implementing task
can be organized by areas of specialization.
When one has to construct an interface
for a specific language it is reasonable to look
for interfaces implemented for other languages whe
re the faced syntactical and morphological prob -
lems have a similar degree of complexity. Having
this in mind, Portuguese language seriously compe-
tes with English because it rises quite important
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic problems similar
to problems risen by latin, slavonic and germanic
languages.
