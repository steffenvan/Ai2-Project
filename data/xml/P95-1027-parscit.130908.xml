We present a corpus-based study of methods
that have been proposed in the linguistics liter-
ature for selecting the semantically unmarked
term out of a pair of antonymous adjectives.
Solutions to this problem are applicable to the
more general task of selecting the positive term
from the pair. Using automatically collected
data, the accuracy and applicability of each
method is quantified, and a statistical analysis
of the significance of the results is performed.
We show that some simple methods are indeed
good indicators for the answer to the problem
while other proposed methods fail to perform
better than would be attributable to chance.
In addition, one of the simplest methods, text
frequency, dominates all others. We also ap-
ply two generic statistical learning methods
for combining the indications of the individual
methods, and compare their performance to
the simple methods. The most sophisticated
complex learning method offers a small, but
statistically significant, improvement over the
original tests.

<bodyText confidence="0.999333190476191">
The concept of markedness originated in the work
of Prague School linguists (Jakobson, 1984a) and
refers to relationships between two complementary
or antonymous terms which can be distinguished by
the presence or absence of a feature (+A versus —A).
Such an opposition can occur at various linguistic
levels. For example, a markedness contrast can arise
at the morphology level, when one of the two words
is derived from the other and therefore contains an
explicit formal marker such as a prefix; e.g., prof-
itable—unprofitable. Markedness contrasts also ap-
pear at the semantic level in many pairs of grad-
able antonymous adjectives, especially scalar ones
(Levinson, 1983), such as tall—short. The marked
and unmarked elements of such pairs function in dif-
ferent ways. The unmarked adjective (e.g., tall) can
be used in how-questions to refer to the property de-
scribed by both adjectives in the pair (e.g., height),
but without any implication about the modified item
relative to the norm for the property. For exam-
ple, the question How tall is Jack? can be answered
equally well by four or seven feet. In contrast, the
marked element of the opposition cannot be used
generically; when used in a how-question, it implies
a presupposition of the speaker regarding the rela-
tive position of the modified item on the adjectival
scale. Thus, the corresponding question using the
marked term of the opposition (How short is Jack?)
conveys an implication on the part of the speaker
that Jack is indeed short; the distinguishing feature
A expresses this presupposition.
While markedness has been described in terms of
a distinguishing feature A, its definition does not
specify the type of this feature. Consequently, sev-
eral different types of features have been employed,
which has led into some confusion about the meaning
of the term markedness. Following Lyons (1977), we
distinguish between formal markedness where the
opposition occurs at the morphology level (i.e., one
of the two terms is derived from the other through
inflection or affixation) and semantic markedness
where the opposition occurs at the semantic level
as in the example above. When two antonymous
terms are also morphologically related, the formally
unmarked term is usually also the semantically un-
marked one (for example, clear—unclear). However,
this correlation is not universal; consider the exam-
ples unbiased—biased and independent—dependent.
In any case, semantic markedness is the more in-
teresting of the two and the harder to determine,
both for humans and computers.
Various tests for determining markedness in gen-
eral have been proposed by linguists (see Section 3).
However, although potentially automatic versions of
some of these have been successfully applied to the
problem at the phonology level (Trubetzkoy, 1939;
Greenberg, 1966), little work has been done on the
empirical validation or the automatic application of
those tests at higher levels (but see (Kueera, 1982)
for an empirical analysis of a proposed markedness
test at the syntactic level; some more narrowly fo-
cused empirical work has also been done on marked-
ness in second language acquisition). In this paper

we analyze the performance of several linguistic tests
for the selection of the semantically unmarked term
out of a pair of gradable antonymous adjectives.
We describe a system that automatically extracts
the relevant data for these tests from text corpora
and corpora-based databases, and use this system
to measure the applicability and accuracy of each
method. We apply statistical tests to determine the
significance of the results, and then discuss the per-
formance of complex predictors that combine the an-
swers of the linguistic tests according to two general
statistical learning methods, decision trees and log-
linear regression models.

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997277347222223">
The goal of our work is twofold: First, we are inter-
ested in providing hard, quantitative evidence on the
performance of markedness tests already proposed
in the linguistics literature. Such tests are based
on intuitive observations and/or particular theories
of semantics, but their accuracy has not been mea-
sured on actual data. The results of our analysis
can be used to substantiate theories which are com-
patible with the empirical evidence, and thus offer
insight into the complex linguistic phenomenon of
antonymy.
The second purpose of our work is practical appli-
cations. The semantically unmarked term is almost
always the positive term of the opposition (Boucher
and Osgood, 1969); e.g., high is positive, while low is
negative. Therefore, an automatic method for deter-
mining markedness values can also be used to deter-
mine the polarity of antonyms. The work reported
in this paper helps clarify which types of data and
tests are useful for such a method and which are not.
The need for an automatic corpus-based method
for the identification of markedness becomes appar-
ent when we consider the high number of adjectives
in unrestricted text and the domain-dependence of
markedness values. In the MRC Psycholinguis-
tic Database (Coltheart, 1981), a large machine-
readable annotated word list, 25,547 of the 150,837
entries (16.94%) are classified as adjectives, not in-
cluding past participles; if we only consider regularly
used grammatical categories for each word, the per-
centage of adjectives rises to 22.97%. For compar-
ison, nouns (the largest class) account for 51.28%
and 57.47% of the words under the two criteria.
In addition, while adjectives tend to have prevalent
markedness and polarity values in the language at
large, frequently these values are negated in spe-
cific domains or contexts. For example, healthy is in
most contexts the unmarked member of the opposi-
tion healthy:sick; but in a hospital setting, sickness
rather than health is expected, so sick becomes the
unmarked term. The methods we describe are based
on the form of the words and their overall statistical
properties, and thus cannot predict specific occur-
rences of markedness reversals. But they can predict
the prevalent markedness value for each adjective in
a given domain, something which is impractical to
do by hand separately for each domain.
We have built a large system for the automatic,
domain-dependent classification of adjectives ac-
cording to semantic criteria. The first phase of our
system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) sep-
arates adjectives into groups of semantically related
ones. We extract markedness values according to
the methods described in this paper and use them in
subsequent phases of the system that further analyze
these groups and determine their scalar structure.
An automatic method for extracting polarity in-
formation would also be useful for the augmenta-
tion of lexico-semantic databases such as WordNet
(Miller et al., 1990), particularly when the method
accounts for the specificities of the domain sublan-
guage; an increasing number of NLP systems rely
on such databases (e.g., (Resnik, 1993; Knight and
Luk, 1994)). Finally, knowledge of polarity can be
combined with corpus-based collocation extraction
methods (Smadja, 1993) to automatically produce
entries for the lexical functions used in Meaning-
Text Theory (MerZuk and Pertsov, 1987) for text
generation. For example, knowing that hearty is
a positive term enables the assignment of the col-
location hearty eater to the lexical function entry
MAGN( eater)=hearty.1

3 Tests for Semantic Markedness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9495475625">
Markedness in general and semantic markedness in
particular have received considerable attention in
the linguistics literature. Consequently, several tests
for determining markedness have been proposed by
linguists. Most of these tests involve human judg-
ments (Greenberg, 1966; Lyons, 1977; Waugh, 1982;
Lehrer, 1985; Ross, 1987; Lakoff, 1987) and are not
suitable for computer implementation. However,
some proposed tests refer to comparisons between
measurable properties of the words in question and
are amenable to full automation. These tests are:
1 Text frequency. Since the unmarked term can
appear in more contexts than the marked one,
and it has both general and specific senses, it
should appear more frequently in text than the
marked term (Greenberg, 1966).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991983111111111">
2. Formal markedness. A formal markedness re-
lationship (i.e., a morphology relationship be-
tween the two words), whenever it exists, should
be an excellent predictor for semantic marked-
ness (Greenberg, 1966; Zwicky, 1978).
3. Formal complexity. Since the unmarked word is
the more general one, it should also be morpho-
logically the simpler (Jakobson, 1962; Battis-
tella, 1990). The &amp;quot;economy of language&amp;quot; prin-

ciple (Zipf, 1949) supports this claim. Note that
this test subsumes test (2).
4. Morphological productivity. Unmarked words,
being more general and frequently used to de-
scribe the whole scale, should be freer to com-
bine with other linguistic elements (Winters,
1990; Battistella, 1990).
5. Differentiation. Unmarked terms should ex-
hibit higher differentiation with more subdis-
tinctions (Jakobson, 1984b) (e.g., the present
tense (unmarked) appears in a greater variety
of forms than the past), or, equivalently, the
marked term should lack some subcategories
(Greenberg, 1966).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934333333333">
The first of the above tests compares the text fre-
quencies of the two words, which are clearly mea-
surable and easily retrievable from a corpus. We
use the one-million word Brown corpus of written
American English (Ku6era and Francis, 1967) for
this purpose. The mapping of the remaining tests to
quantifiable variables is not as immediate. We use
the length of a word in characters, which is a rea-
sonable indirect index of morphological complexity,
for tests (2) and (3). This indicator is exact for the
case of test (2), since the formally marked word is
derived from the unmarked one through the addition
of an affix (which for adjectives is always a prefix).
The number of syllables in a word is another rea-
sonable indicator of morphological complexity that
we consider, although it is much harder to compute
automatically than word length.
For morphological productivity (test (4)), we mea-
sure several variables related to the freedom of the
word to receive affixes and to participate in com-
pounds. Several distinctions exist for the definition
of a variable that measures the number of words
that are morphologically derived from a given word.
These distinctions involve:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984276916666667">
• Whether to consider the number of distinct
words in this category (types) or the total fre-
quency of these words (tokens).
• Whether to separate words derived through
affixation from compounds or combine these
types of morphological relationships.
• If word types (rather than word frequencies) are
measured, we can select to count homographs
(words identical in form but with different parts
of speech, e.g., light as an adjective and light as
a verb) as distinct types or map all homographs
of the same word form to the same word type.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999155642857143">
Finally, the differentiation test (5) is the one gen-
eral markedness test that cannot be easily mapped
into observable properties of adjectives. Somewhat
arbitrarily, we mapped this test to the number of
grammatical categories (parts of speech) that each
word can appear under, postulating that the un-
marked term should have a higher such number.
The various ways of measuring the quantities com-
pared by the tests discussed above lead to the consid-
eration of 32 variables. Since some of these variables
are closely related and their number is so high that
it impedes the task of modeling semantic marked-
ness in terms of them, we combined several of them,
keeping 14 variables for the statistical analysis.

4 Data Collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989816">
In order to measure the performance of the marked-
ness tests discussed in the previous section, we
collected a fairly large sample of pairs of antony-
mous gradable adjectives that can appear in how-
questions. The Deese antonyms (Deese, 1964) is the
prototypical collection of pairs of antonymous adjec-
tives that have been used for similar analyses in the
past (Deese, 1964; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Grefen-
stette, 1992). However, this collection contains only
75 adjectives in 40 pairs, some of which cannot be
used in our study either because they are primar-
ily adverbials (e.g., inside—outside) or not gradable
(e.g., alive—dead). Unlike previous studies, the na-
ture of the statistical analysis reported in this paper
requires a higher number of pairs.
Consequently, we augmented the Deese set with
the set of pairs used in the largest manual previ-
ous study of markedness in adjective pairs (Lehrer,
1985). In addition, we included all gradable adjec-
tives which appear 50 times or more in the Brown
corpus and have at least one gradable antonym;
the antonyms were not restricted to belong to this
set of frequent adjectives. For each adjective col-
lected according to this last criterion, we included all
the antonyms (frequent or not) that were explicitly
listed in the Collins COBUILD dictionary (Sinclair,
1987) for each of its senses. This process gave us a
sample of 449 adjectives (both frequent and infre-
quent ones) in 344 pairs.&apos;
We separated the pairs on the basis of the how-test
into those that contain one semantically unmarked
and one marked term and those that contain two
marked terms (e.g., fat—thin), removing the latter.
For the remaining pairs, we identified the unmarked
member, using existing designations (Lehrer, 1985)
whenever that was possible; when in doubt, the pair
was dropped from further consideration. We also
separated the pairs into two groups according to
whether the two adjectives in each pair were mor-
phologically related or not. This allowed us to study
the different behavior of the tests for the two groups
separately. Table 1 shows the results of this cross-
classification of the adjective pairs.
Our next step was to measure the variables de-
scribed in Section 3 which are used in the various

started from frequent adjectives but used human sub-
jects to elicit antonyms instead of a dictionary.

ments, we used the MRC Psycholinguistic Database
(Coltheart, 1981) which contains a variety of mea-
sures for 150,837 entries counting different parts of
speech or inflected forms as different words (115,331
distinct words). We implemented an extractor pro-
gram to collect the relevant measurements for the
adjectives in our sample, namely text frequency,
number of syllables, word length, and number of
parts of speech. All this information except the
number of syllables can also be automatically ex-
tracted from the corpus. The extractor program also
computes information that is not directly stored in
the MRC database. Affixation rules from (Quirk et
al., 1985) are recursively employed to check whether
each word in the database can be derived from each
adjective, and counts and frequencies of such de-
rived words and compounds are collected. Overall,
32 measurements are computed for each adjective,
and are subsequently combined into the 14 variables
used in our study.
Finally, the variables for the pairs are computed
as the differences between the corresponding vari-
ables for the adjectives in each pair. The output of
this stage is a table, with two strata corresponding
to the two groups, and containing measurements on
14 variables for the 279 pairs with a semantically
unmarked member.

5 Evaluation of Linguistic Tests
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999778176470588">
For each of the variables, we measured how many
pairs in each group it classified correctly. A positive
(negative) value indicates that the first (second) ad-
jective is the unmarked one, except for two variables
(word length and number of syllables) where the op-
posite is true. When the difference is zero, the vari-
able selects neither the first or second adjective as
unmarked. The percentage of nonzero differences,
which correspond to cases where the test actually
suggests a choice, is reported as the applicability of
the variable. For the purpose of evaluating the accu-
racy of the variable, we assign such cases randomly
to one of the two possible outcomes in accordance
with common practice in classification (Duda and
Hart, 1973).
For each variable and each of the two groups, we
also performed a statistical test of the null hypoth-
esis that its true accuracy is 50%, i.e., equal to the
expected accuracy of a random binary classifier. Un-
der the null hypothesis, the number of correct re-
sponses follows a binomial distribution with param-
eter p = 0.5. Since all obtained measurements of
accuracy were higher than 50%, any rejection of the
null hypothesis implies that the corresponding test
is significantly better than chance.
Table 2 summarizes the values obtained for some
of the 14 variables in our data and reveals some
surprising facts about their performance. The fre-
quency of the adjectives is the best predictor in both
groups, achieving an overall accuracy of 80.64% with
high applicability (98.5-99%). This is all the more
remarkable in the case of the morphologically related
adjectives, where frequency outperforms length of
the words; recall that the latter directly encodes the
formal markedness relationship, so frequency is able
to correctly classify some of the cases where formal
and semantic markedness values disagree. On the
other hand, tests based on the &amp;quot;economy of lan-
guage&amp;quot; principle, such as word length and number
of syllables, perform badly when formal markedness
relationships do not exist, with lower applicability
and very low accuracy scores. The same can be said
about the test based on the differentiation properties
of the words (number of different parts of speech). In
fact, for these three variables, the hypothesis of ran-
dom performance cannot be rejected even at the 5%
level. Tests based on the productivity of the words,
as measured through affixation and compounding,
tend to fall in-between: their accuracy is generally
significant, but their applicability is sometimes low,
particularly for compounds.

While the frequency of the adjectives is the best
single predictor, we would expect to gain accuracy
by combining the answers of several simple tests.
We consider the problem of determining semantic
markedness as a classification problem with two pos-
sible outcomes (&amp;quot;the first adjective is unmarked&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;the second adjective is unmarked&amp;quot;). To de-
sign an appropriate classifier, we employed two gen-
eral statistical supervised learning methods, which
we briefly describe in this section.
Decision trees (Quinlan, 1986) is the first statis-
tical supervised learning paradigm that we explored.
A popular method for the automatic construction
of such trees is binary recursive partitioning, which
constructs a binary tree in a top-down fashion.

discriminates among the possible outcomes is se-
lected and a test of the form X &lt; constant is as-

sociated with the root node of the tree. All train-
ing cases for which this test succeeds (fails) belong
to the left (right) subtree of the decision tree. The
method proceeds recursively, by selecting a new vari-
able (possibly the same as in the parent node) and
a new cutting point for each subtree, until all the
cases in one subtree belong to the same category or
the data becomes too sparse. When a node can-
not be split further, it is labeled with the locally
most probable category. During prediction, a path
is traced from the root of the tree to a leaf, and the
category of the leaf is the category reported.
If the tree is left to grow uncontrolled, it will ex-
actly represent the training set (including its pecu-
liarities and random variations), and will not be very
useful for prediction on new cases. Consequently,
the growing phase is terminated before the training
samples assigned to the leaf nodes are entirely ho-
mogeneous. A technique that improves the quality
of the induced tree is to grow a larger than optimal
tree and then shrink it by pruning subtrees (Breiman
et al., 1984). In order to select the nodes to shrink,
we normally need to use new data that has not been
used for the construction of the original tree.
In our classifier, we employ a maximum likeli-
hood estimator based on the binomial distribution
to select the optimal split at each node. During the
shrinking phase, we optimally regress the probabili-
ties of children nodes to their parent according to a
shrinking parameter a (Hastie and Pregibon, 1990),
instead of pruning entire subtrees. To select the op-
timal value for a, we initially held out a part of the
training data. In a later version of the classifier,
we employed cross-validation, separating our train-
ing data in 10 equally sized subsets and repeatedly
training on 9 of them and validating on the other.
Log-linear regression (Santner and Duffy,
1989) is the second general supervised learning
method that we explored. In classical linear model-
ing, the response variable y is modeled as y =bTx-Fe
where b is a vector of weights, x is the vector of the
values of the predictor variables and e is an error
term which is assumed to be normally distributed
with zero mean and constant variance, independent
of the mean of y. The log-linear regression model
generalizes this setting to binomial sampling where
the response variable follows a Bernoulli distribution
(corresponding to a two-category outcome); note
that the variance of the error term is not indepen-
dent of the mean of y any more. The resulting gen-
eralized linear model (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989)
employs a linear predictor i = bTx e as before,
but the response variable y is non-linearly related to
n through the inverse logit function,

Note that y E (0, 1); each of the two ends of that
interval is associated with one of the possible choices.
We employ the iterative reweighted least squares
algorithm (Baker and Nelder, 1989) to approximate
the maximum likelihood estimate of the vector b,
but first we explicitly drop the constant term (in-
tercept) and most of the variables. The intercept
is dropped because the prior probabilities of the
two outcomes are known to be equal.3 Several of
the variables are dropped to avoid overfitting (Duda
and Hart, 1973); otherwise the regression model will
use all available variables, unless some of them are
linearly dependent. To identify which variables we
should keep in the model, we use the analysis of de-
viance method with iterative stepwise refinement of
the model by iteratively adding or dropping one term

favorably with the resulting loss (gain) in residual
degrees of freedom. Using a fixed training set, six
of the fourteen variables were selected for modeling
the morphologically unrelated adjectives. Frequency
was selected as the only component of the model for
the morphologically related ones.
We also examined the possibility of replacing some
variables in these models by smoothing cubic B-
splines (Wahba, 1990). The analysis of deviance for
this model indicated that for the morphologically
unrelated adjectives, one of the six selected variables
should be removed altogether and another should be
replaced by a smoothing spline.

For both decision trees and log-linear regression, we
repeatedly partitioned the data in each of the two
groups into equally sized training and testing sets,
constructed the predictors using the training sets,
and evaluated them on the testing sets. This pro-
cess was repeated 200 times, giving vectors of esti-
mates for the performance of the various methods.
The simple frequency test was also evaluated in each
testing set for comparison purposes. From these vec-
tors, we estimate the density of the distribution of
the scores for each method; Figure 1 gives these den-
sities for the frequency test and the log-linear model
with smoothing splines on the most difficult case,
the morphologically unrelated adjectives.
Table 3 summarizes the performance of the meth-
ods on the two groups of adjective pairs.4 In order
to assess the significance of the differences between

the scores, we performed a nonparametric sign test
(Gibbons and Chakraborti, 1992) for each complex
predictor against the simple frequency variable. The
test statistic is the number of runs where the score
of one predictor is higher than the other&apos;s; as is com-
mon in statistical practice, ties are broken by assign-
ing half of them to each category. Under the null
hypothesis of equal performance of the two methods
that are contrasted, this test statistic follows the bi-
nomial distribution with p = 0.5. Table 3 includes
the exact probabilities for obtaining the observed (or
more extreme) values of the test statistic.
From the table, we observe that the tree-based
methods perform considerably worse than frequency
(significant at any conceivable level), even when
cross-validation is employed. Both the standard
and smoothed log-linear models outperform the fre-
quency test on the morphologically unrelated adjec-
tives (significant at the 5% and 0.1% levels respec-
tively), while the log-linear model&apos;s performance is
comparable to the frequency test&apos;s on the morpho-
logically related adjectives. The best predictor over-
all is the smoothed log-linear model.&apos;
The above results indicate that the frequency test
essentially contains almost all the information that
can be extracted collectively from all linguistic tests.
Consequently, even very sophisticated methods for
combining the tests can offer only small improve-
ment. Furthermore, the prominence of one variable
can easily lead to overfitting the training data in the
remaining variables. This causes the decision tree
models to perform badly.

8 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991411333333333">
We have presented a quantitative analysis of the per-
formance of measurable linguistic tests for the selec-
tion of the semantically unmarked term out of a pair
of antonymous adjectives. The analysis shows that a
simple test, word frequency, outperforms more com-
plicated tests, and also dominates them in terms of
information content. Some of the tests that have
been proposed in the linguistics literature, notably
tests that are based on the formal complexity and
differentiation properties of the words, fail to give
any useful information at all, at least with the ap-
proximations we used for them (Section 3). On the
other hand, tests based on morphological productiv-
ity are valid, although not as accurate as frequency.
Naturally, the validity of our results depends on
the quality of our measurements. While for most of
the variables our measurements are necessarily ap-
&apos;It should be noted here that the independence as-
sumption of the sign test is mildly violated in these re-
peated runs, since the scores depend on collections of in-
dependent samples from a finite population. This mild
dependence will increase somewhat the probabilities un-
der the true null distribution, but we can be confident
that probabilities such as 0.08% will remain significant.

proximate, we believe that they are nevertheless of
acceptable accuracy since (1) we used a representa-
tive corpus; (2) we selected both a large sample of
adjective pairs and a large number of frequent ad-
jectives to avoid sparse data problems; (3) the pro-
cedure of identifying secondary words for indirect
measurements based on morphological productivity
operates with high recall and precision; and (4) the
mapping of the linguistic tests to comparisons of
quantitative variables was in most cases straightfor-
ward, and always at least plausible.
The analysis of the linguistic tests and their com-
binations has also led to a computational method
for the determination of semantic markedness. The
method is completely automatic and produces ac-
curate results at 82% of the cases. We consider
this performance reasonably good, especially since
no previous automatic method for the task has been
proposed. While we used a fixed set of 449 adjec-
tives for our analysis, the number of adjectives in
unrestricted text is much higher, as we noted in Sec-
tion 2. This multitude of adjectives, combined with
the dependence of semantic markedness on the do-
main, makes the manual identification of markedness
values impractical.
In the future, we plan to expand our analy-
sis to other classes of antonymous words, particu-
larly verbs which are notoriously difficult to ana-
lyze semantically (Levin, 1993). A similar method-
ology can be applied to identify unmarked (posi-
tive) versus marked (negative) terms in pairs such
as agree:dissent.

Abstract We present a corpus-based study of methods that have been proposed in the linguistics literature for selecting the semantically unmarked term out of a pair of antonymous adjectives. Solutions to this problem are applicable to the more general task of selecting the positive term from the pair. Using automatically collected data, the accuracy and applicability of each method is quantified, and a statistical analysis of the significance of the results is performed. We show that some simple methods are indeed good indicators for the answer to the problem while other proposed methods fail to perform better than would be attributable to chance. In addition, one of the simplest methods, text frequency, dominates all others. We also apply two generic statistical learning methods for combining the indications of the individual methods, and compare their performance to the simple methods. The most sophisticated complex learning method offers a small, but statistically significant, improvement over the original tests.</abstract>

The resulting generalized linear model (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) employs a linear predictor i = bTx e as before, but the response variable y is non-linearly related to n through the inverse logit function, Y = 1+ Note that y E (0, 1); each of the two ends of that interval is associated with one of the possible choices. We employ the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm (Baker and Nelder, 1989) to approximate the maximum likelihood estimate of the vector b, but first we explicitly drop the constant term (intercept) and most of the variables. The intercept is dropped because the prior probabilities of the two outcomes are known to be equal.3 Several of the variables are dropped to avoid overfitting (Duda and Hart, 1973); otherwise the regression model will use all available variables, unless some of them are linearly dependent. To identify which variables we should keep in the model, we use the analysis of deviance method with iterative stepwise refinement of the model by iteratively</context>

Since the unmarked term can appear in more contexts than the marked one, and it has both general and specific senses, it should appear more frequently in text than the marked term (Greenberg, 1966). 2. Formal markedness. A formal markedness relationship (i.e., a morphology relationship between the two words), whenever it exists, should be an excellent predictor for semantic markedness (Greenberg, 1966; Zwicky, 1978). 3. Formal complexity. Since the unmarked word is the more general one, it should also be morphologically the simpler (Jakobson, 1962; Battistella, 1990). The &amp;quot;economy of language&amp;quot; prin1MAGN stands for magnify. 198 ciple (Zipf, 1949) supports this claim. Note that this test subsumes test (2). 4. Morphological productivity. Unmarked words, being more general and frequently used to describe the whole scale, should be freer to combine with other linguistic elements (Winters, 1990; Battistella, 1990). 5. Differentiation. Unmarked terms should exhibit higher differentiation with more subdistinctions (Jakobson, 1984b) (e.g., the present tense (unmarked) appears in a greater variety of forms than the past), or, equivalently, the marked term should la</context>

Such tests are based on intuitive observations and/or particular theories of semantics, but their accuracy has not been measured on actual data. The results of our analysis can be used to substantiate theories which are compatible with the empirical evidence, and thus offer insight into the complex linguistic phenomenon of antonymy. The second purpose of our work is practical applications. The semantically unmarked term is almost always the positive term of the opposition (Boucher and Osgood, 1969); e.g., high is positive, while low is negative. Therefore, an automatic method for determining markedness values can also be used to determine the polarity of antonyms. The work reported in this paper helps clarify which types of data and tests are useful for such a method and which are not. The need for an automatic corpus-based method for the identification of markedness becomes apparent when we consider the high number of adjectives in unrestricted text and the domain-dependence of markedness values.

During prediction, a path is traced from the root of the tree to a leaf, and the category of the leaf is the category reported. If the tree is left to grow uncontrolled, it will exactly represent the training set (including its peculiarities and random variations), and will not be very useful for prediction on new cases. Consequently, the growing phase is terminated before the training samples assigned to the leaf nodes are entirely homogeneous. A technique that improves the quality of the induced tree is to grow a larger than optimal tree and then shrink it by pruning subtrees (Breiman et al., 1984). In order to select the nodes to shrink, we normally need to use new data that has not been used for the construction of the original tree. In our classifier, we employ a maximum likelihood estimator based on the binomial distribution to select the optimal split at each node. During the shrinking phase, we optimally regress the probabilities of children nodes to their parent according to a shrinking parameter a (Hastie and Pregibon, 1990), instead of pruning entire subtrees. To select the optimal value for a, we initially held out a part of the training data. In a later version of the classif</context>

The need for an automatic corpus-based method for the identification of markedness becomes apparent when we consider the high number of adjectives in unrestricted text and the domain-dependence of markedness values. In the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981), a large machinereadable annotated word list, 25,547 of the 150,837 entries (16.94%) are classified as adjectives, not including past participles; if we only consider regularly used grammatical categories for each word, the percentage of adjectives rises to 22.97%. For comparison, nouns (the largest class) account for 51.28% and 57.47% of the words under the two criteria. In addition, while adjectives tend to have prevalent markedness and polarity values in the language at large, frequently these values are negated in specific domains or contexts.

For these measurements, we used the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981) which contains a variety of measures for 150,837 entries counting different parts of speech or inflected forms as different words (115,331 distinct words). We implemented an extractor program to collect the relevant measurements for the adjectives in our sample, namely text frequency, number of syllables, word length, and number of parts of speech. All this information except the number of syllables can also be automatically extracted from the corpus.

Since some of these variables are closely related and their number is so high that it impedes the task of modeling semantic markedness in terms of them, we combined several of them, keeping 14 variables for the statistical analysis. 4 Data Collection In order to measure the performance of the markedness tests discussed in the previous section, we collected a fairly large sample of pairs of antonymous gradable adjectives that can appear in howquestions. The Deese antonyms (Deese, 1964) is the prototypical collection of pairs of antonymous adjectives that have been used for similar analyses in the past (Deese, 1964; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Grefenstette, 1992). However, this collection contains only 75 adjectives in 40 pairs, some of which cannot be used in our study either because they are primarily adverbials (e.g., inside—outside) or not gradable (e.g., alive—dead). Unlike previous studies, the nature of the statistical analysis reported in this paper requires a higher number of pairs.

For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of the variable, we assign such cases randomly to one of the two possible outcomes in accordance with common practice in classification (Duda and Hart, 1973). For each variable and each of the two groups, we also performed a statistical test of the null hypothesis that its true accuracy is 50%, i.e., equal to the expected accuracy of a random binary classifier. Under the null hypothesis, the number of correct responses follows a binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.5. Since all obtained measurements of accuracy were higher than 50%, any rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the corresponding test is significantly better than chance.

We employ the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm (Baker and Nelder, 1989) to approximate the maximum likelihood estimate of the vector b, but first we explicitly drop the constant term (intercept) and most of the variables. The intercept is dropped because the prior probabilities of the two outcomes are known to be equal.3 Several of the variables are dropped to avoid overfitting (Duda and Hart, 1973); otherwise the regression model will use all available variables, unless some of them are linearly dependent. To identify which variables we should keep in the model, we use the analysis of deviance method with iterative stepwise refinement of the model by iteratively adding or dropping one term if the reduction (increase) in the deviance compares 3 The order of the adjectives in the pairs is randomized before training the model, to ensure that both outcomes are equiprobable. 201 40% 50% 60% 70% Accuracy Figure 1: Probability densities for the accuracy of the frequency method (dotted line) an</context>

However, this correlation is not universal; consider the examples unbiased—biased and independent—dependent. In any case, semantic markedness is the more interesting of the two and the harder to determine, both for humans and computers. Various tests for determining markedness in general have been proposed by linguists (see Section 3). However, although potentially automatic versions of some of these have been successfully applied to the problem at the phonology level (Trubetzkoy, 1939; Greenberg, 1966), little work has been done on the empirical validation or the automatic application of those tests at higher levels (but see (Kueera, 1982) for an empirical analysis of a proposed markedness test at the syntactic level; some more narrowly focused empirical work has also been done on markedness in second language acquisition).

Consequently, several tests for determining markedness have been proposed by linguists. Most of these tests involve human judgments (Greenberg, 1966; Lyons, 1977; Waugh, 1982; Lehrer, 1985; Ross, 1987; Lakoff, 1987) and are not suitable for computer implementation. However, some proposed tests refer to comparisons between measurable properties of the words in question and are amenable to full automation. These tests are: 1 Text frequency. Since the unmarked term can appear in more contexts than the marked one, and it has both general and specific senses, it should appear more frequently in text than the marked term (Greenberg, 1966). 2.

Unmarked words, being more general and frequently used to describe the whole scale, should be freer to combine with other linguistic elements (Winters, 1990; Battistella, 1990). 5. Differentiation. Unmarked terms should exhibit higher differentiation with more subdistinctions (Jakobson, 1984b) (e.g., the present tense (unmarked) appears in a greater variety of forms than the past), or, equivalently, the marked term should lack some subcategories (Greenberg, 1966). The first of the above tests compares the text frequencies of the two words, which are clearly measurable and easily retrievable from a corpus. We use the one-million word Brown corpus of written American English (Ku6era and Francis, 1967) for this purpose. The mapping of the remaining tests to quantifiable variables is not as immediate. We use the length of a word in characters, which is a reasonable indirect index of morphological complexity, for tests (2) and (3).

The Deese antonyms (Deese, 1964) is the prototypical collection of pairs of antonymous adjectives that have been used for similar analyses in the past (Deese, 1964; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Grefenstette, 1992). However, this collection contains only 75 adjectives in 40 pairs, some of which cannot be used in our study either because they are primarily adverbials (e.g., inside—outside) or not gradable (e.g., alive—dead). Unlike previous studies, the nature of the statistical analysis reported in this paper requires a higher number of pairs. Consequently, we augmented the Deese set with the set of pairs used in the largest manual previous study of markedness in adjective pairs (Lehrer, 1985). In addition, we included all gradable adjectives which appear 50 times or more in the Brown corpus and have at</context>

A technique that improves the quality of the induced tree is to grow a larger than optimal tree and then shrink it by pruning subtrees (Breiman et al., 1984). In order to select the nodes to shrink, we normally need to use new data that has not been used for the construction of the original tree. In our classifier, we employ a maximum likelihood estimator based on the binomial distribution to select the optimal split at each node. During the shrinking phase, we optimally regress the probabilities of children nodes to their parent according to a shrinking parameter a (Hastie and Pregibon, 1990), instead of pruning entire subtrees. To select the optimal value for a, we initially held out a part of the training data. In a later version of the classifier, we employed cross-validation, separating our training data in 10 equally sized subsets and repeatedly training on 9 of them and validating on the other. Log-linear regression (Santner and Duffy, 1989) is the second general supervised learning method that we explored. In classical linear modeling, the response variable y is modeled as y =bTx-Fe where b is a vector of weights, x is the vector of the values of the predictor variables and</context>

The methods we describe are based on the form of the words and their overall statistical properties, and thus cannot predict specific occurrences of markedness reversals. But they can predict the prevalent markedness value for each adjective in a given domain, something which is impractical to do by hand separately for each domain. We have built a large system for the automatic, domain-dependent classification of adjectives according to semantic criteria. The first phase of our system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) separates adjectives into groups of semantically related ones. We extract markedness values according to the methods described in this paper and use them in subsequent phases of the system that further analyze these groups and determine their scalar structure. An automatic method for extracting polarity information would also be useful for the augmentation of lexico-semantic databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), particularly when the method accounts for the specificities of the domain sublanguage; an increasing number of NLP systems rely on such databases (e.g., (Resnik, 1993; Knig</context>

However, this collection contains only 75 adjectives in 40 pairs, some of which cannot be used in our study either because they are primarily adverbials (e.g., inside—outside) or not gradable (e.g., alive—dead). Unlike previous studies, the nature of the statistical analysis reported in this paper requires a higher number of pairs. Consequently, we augmented the Deese set with the set of pairs used in the largest manual previous study of markedness in adjective pairs (Lehrer, 1985). In addition, we included all gradable adjectives which appear 50 times or more in the Brown corpus and have at least one gradable antonym; the antonyms were not restricted to belong to this set of frequent adjectives. For each adjective collected according to this last criterion, we included all the antonyms (frequent or not) that were explicitly listed in the Collins COBUILD dictionary (Sinclair, 1987) for each of its senses. This process gave us a sample of 449 adjectives (both frequent and infrequent ones) in 344 pairs.&apos; We separated the pairs on the basis of the how-test into those that </context>

We consider this performance reasonably good, especially since no previous automatic method for the task has been proposed. While we used a fixed set of 449 adjectives for our analysis, the number of adjectives in unrestricted text is much higher, as we noted in Section 2. This multitude of adjectives, combined with the dependence of semantic markedness on the domain, makes the manual identification of markedness values impractical. In the future, we plan to expand our analysis to other classes of antonymous words, particularly verbs which are notoriously difficult to analyze semantically (Levin, 1993). A similar methodology can be applied to identify unmarked (positive) versus marked (negative) terms in pairs such as agree:dissent.

Such an opposition can occur at various linguistic levels. For example, a markedness contrast can arise at the morphology level, when one of the two words is derived from the other and therefore contains an explicit formal marker such as a prefix; e.g., profitable—unprofitable. Markedness contrasts also appear at the semantic level in many pairs of gradable antonymous adjectives, especially scalar ones (Levinson, 1983), such as tall—short. The marked and unmarked elements of such pairs function in different ways. The unmarked adjective (e.g., tall) can be used in how-questions to refer to the property described by both adjectives in the pair (e.g., height), but without any implication about the modified item relative to the norm for the property. For example, the question How tall is Jack? can be answered equally well by four or seven feet. In contrast, the marked element of the opposition cannot be used generically; when used in a how-question, it implies a presupposition of the speaker regarding the relat</context>

Thus, the corresponding question using the marked term of the opposition (How short is Jack?) conveys an implication on the part of the speaker that Jack is indeed short; the distinguishing feature A expresses this presupposition. While markedness has been described in terms of a distinguishing feature A, its definition does not specify the type of this feature. Consequently, several different types of features have been employed, which has led into some confusion about the meaning of the term markedness. Following Lyons (1977), we distinguish between formal markedness where the opposition occurs at the morphology level (i.e., one of the two terms is derived from the other through inflection or affixation) and semantic markedness where the opposition occurs at the semantic level as in the example above. When two antonymous terms are also morphologically related, the formally unmarked term is usually also the semantically unmarked one (for example, clear—unclear). However, this correlation is not universal; consider the examples unbiased—biased and independent—dependent. In any case, semantic markedness is the more i</context>

We have built a large system for the automatic, domain-dependent classification of adjectives according to semantic criteria. The first phase of our system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) separates adjectives into groups of semantically related ones. We extract markedness values according to the methods described in this paper and use them in subsequent phases of the system that further analyze these groups and determine their scalar structure. An automatic method for extracting polarity information would also be useful for the augmentation of lexico-semantic databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), particularly when the method accounts for the specificities of the domain sublanguage; an increasing number of NLP systems rely on such databases (e.g., (Resnik, 1993; Knight and Luk, 1994)). Finally, knowledge of polarity can be combined with corpus-based collocation extraction methods (Smadja, 1993) to automatically produce entries for the lexical functions used in MeaningText Theory (MerZuk and Pertsov, 1987) for text generation.

We consider the problem of determining semantic markedness as a classification problem with two possible outcomes (&amp;quot;the first adjective is unmarked&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the second adjective is unmarked&amp;quot;). To design an appropriate classifier, we employed two general statistical supervised learning methods, which we briefly describe in this section. Decision trees (Quinlan, 1986) is the first statistical supervised learning paradigm that we explored. A popular method for the automatic construction of such trees is binary recursive partitioning, which constructs a binary tree in a top-down fashion.

All this information except the number of syllables can also be automatically extracted from the corpus. The extractor program also computes information that is not directly stored in the MRC database. Affixation rules from (Quirk et al., 1985) are recursively employed to check whether each word in the database can be derived from each adjective, and counts and frequencies of such derived words and compounds are collected.

To select the optimal value for a, we initially held out a part of the training data. In a later version of the classifier, we employed cross-validation, separating our training data in 10 equally sized subsets and repeatedly training on 9 of them and validating on the other.

For example, knowing that hearty is a positive term enables the assignment of the collocation hearty eater to the lexical function entry MAGN( eater)=hearty.1 3 Tests for Semantic Markedness Markedness in general and semantic markedness in particular have received considerable attention in the linguistics literature. Consequently, several tests for determining markedness have been proposed by linguists. Most of these tests involve human judgments (Greenberg, 1966; Lyons, 1977; Waugh, 1982; Lehrer, 1985; Ross, 1987; Lakoff, 1987) and are not suitable for computer implementation. However, some proposed tests refer to comparisons between measurable properties of the words in question and are amenable to full automation. These tests are: 1 Text frequency. Since the unmarked term can appear in more contexts than the marked one, and it has both general and specific senses, it should appear more frequently in text than the marked term (Greenberg, 1966). 2. Formal markedness. A formal markedness relationship (i.e., a morphology relationship between the two words), whenever it exists, </context>

Formal complexity. Since the unmarked word is the more general one, it should also be morphologically the simpler (Jakobson, 1962; Battistella, 1990). The &amp;quot;economy of language&amp;quot; prin1MAGN stands for magnify. 198 ciple (Zipf, 1949) supports this claim. Note that this test subsumes test (2). 4. Morphological productivity. Unmarked words, being more general and frequently used to describe the whole scale, should be freer to combine with other linguistic elements (Winters, 1990; Battistella, 1990). 5. Differentiation. Unmarked terms should exhibit higher differentiation with more subdistinctions (Jakobson, 1984b) (e.g., the present tense (unmarked) appears in a greater variety of forms than the past), or, equivalently, the marked term should lack some subcategories (Greenberg, 1966). The first of the above tests compares the text frequencies of the two words, which are clearly measurable and easily retrievable from a corpus. We use the one-million word Brown corpus of written American English (Ku6era and Francis, 1967) for this purpose. The mapping of the remaining </context>
