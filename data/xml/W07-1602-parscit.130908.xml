Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999935466666667">
In order for automated navigation systems
to operate effectively, the route instructions
they produce must be clear, concise and eas-
ily understood by users. In order to incorpo-
rate a landmark within a coherent sentence,
it is necessary to first understand how that
landmark is conceptualised by travellers —
whether it is perceived as point-like, line-
like or area-like. This paper investigates
the viability of automatically classifying the
conceptualisation of landmarks relative to a
given city context. We use web data to learn
the default conceptualisation of those land-
marks, crucially analysing preposition and
verb collocations in the classification.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946959183674">
At present, many navigation systems produce badly-
worded and difficult to follow route instructions,
which do not closely correspond with the way
people give one another directions (Dale et al.,
2005). Typically, automated navigation systems
give turning instructions with street names as refer-
ence points, eg turn right at Smith St. By contrast,
human-generated route instructions tend to use land-
marks in preference to street names as navigational
reference points (Michon and Denis, 2001).
According to Allen (1997), landmarks are typi-
cally used in route directions in one of two ways—
as descriptives, providing a static picture of a spa-
tial scene so that the traveller can verify his or her
location along a route, eg the City Library is on
your left, or to specify or clarify a point on a route
at which the traveller must make a choice between
multiple pathways, termed choice points or decision
points. Route instructions which identify decision
points with respect to landmarks have been found to
be significantly easier to follow than standard street-
based or turn-based route instructions (Michon and
Denis, 2001).
This paper goes beyond classical approaches to
landmarks that focus on salient point-like objects.
Instead, we aim to find appropriate ways of classify-
ing landmarks automatically, based on the way those
landmarks are used in spatial sentences on the web:
as point-like, linear-like, and area-like objects that
structure movement pattern in urban spaces. In par-
ticular, we analyse how different prepositions and
verbs with pre-classified semantics co-occur with
mentions of the landmarks. A preposition such as
through can be used with reference to a landmark
we are conceptualising as an area, but not one we are
conceptualising as a point. Landau and Jackendoff
(1993) presented an analysis of the spatial proper-
ties of commonly used English spatial prepositions,
such as at, in and to. This classification used as the
basis of a list of prepositions for the present study,
grouped according to whether the preposition indi-
cates a point-like, line-like or area-like landmark. In
addition, a short list of verbs was compiled based
on the verb classes of Levin (1993) and similarly di-
vided into the three conceptual classes.
Each of the verbs and prepositions was combined
in turn with a list of landmarks in Melbourne, Aus-
tralia, to produce a series of spatial phrases such
as at Flinders St Station. These phrases were then

sent to the Google search engine, which determined
the approximate number of documents on the web
containing that exact phrase. The document counts
were then summed over the conceptual categories
the prepositions and verbs appeared in — point, line
and area. The result of this was a probabilistic cat-
egorisation of each landmark, according to its usage
in spatial contexts on the web.
Evaluation of the baseline was performed based
on annotators’ independent judgements of the con-
ceptual class of each of the landmarks, gathered
from a web-based annotation interface. It was found
that the baseline classification agreed with the gold
standard classification 63.8% of the time. A slight
improvement on the baseline was achieved via a su-
pervised neural network classifier, which took the
web counts as inputs. This classifier agreed with
the gold standard 68.5% of the time. As a result
of this analysis, a set of systematically ambiguous
landmarks was identified, with implications for fu-
ture landmark classification models.
In the remainder of this paper, we describe back-
ground research (Section 2) and then outline our re-
search methodology (Section 3). We then present
the results of a series of landmark classification
experiments (Section 4), and finally discuss the
broader implications of the experiments (Section 5).

2.1 Spatial Cognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998637888888889">
Route directions should be designed in such a way as
to be quickly and easily comprehended by the trav-
eller (Lovelace et al., 1999). Optimally, route di-
rections should exhibit cognitive adequacy — char-
acterising an external representation of a route (as
with a map or route directions) in a way supportive
of human spatial cognitive processes and knowledge
representation (Klippel, 2003). For this reason, the
improvement of route directions requires an investi-
gation into human spatial cognition.
Route instructions which reference landmarks are
able to achieve a number of worthwhile goals: they
have the effect of increasing the spatial awareness
of the recipient by informing them about their sur-
roundings; landmark-referencing route instructions
can decrease the cognitive load on the recipient; and
it is more natural-sounding to receive route instruc-
tions in terms of landmarks.

2.2 Landmark Conceptualisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894523809524">
In order to provide appropriate landmark-referenced
route instructions, it is necessary to understand how
landmarks can be used in spatial sentences to locate
a trajector. On a geometric level, all landmarks can
be considered areas when projected onto a top-down
map. However, on a conceptual level, landmarks can
be used in a point-like, line-like or area-like manner,
depending on their spatial relationship with a route
(Hansen et al., 2006).
One possible approach to determining a land-
mark’s conceptual class is to make use of the land-
mark’s geometric context, including its size relative
to the route and the number of decision points with
which it coincides. However, this approach may
have little ecological validity, as people may not in
fact conceptualise landmarks as point, line or area
based purely on geometry, but also based on prag-
matic considerations. For instance, it may be the
case that people don’t tend to conceptualise Flinders
St Station as an area, even though it satisfies the ge-
ometric criteria.

2.3 Past Research on Landmark Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991684210526">
The only research we are aware of which has ad-
dressed this same topic of landmark interpretation
is that of Tezuka and Tanaka (2005). In an investi-
gation of the spatial use of landmarks in sentences,
Tezuka and Tanaka (2005) modified existing web
mining methods to include spatial context in order
to obtain landmark information.
It is natural to question the appropriateness of web
data for research purposes, because web data is in-
evitably noisy and search engines themselves can in-
troduce certain idiosyncracies which can distort re-
sults (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). However,
the vast amount of data available can nevertheless
give better results than more theoretically motivated
techniques (Lapata and Keller, 2004). And impor-
tantly, the data that can be gleaned from the web
does not mirror the view of a single person or a se-
lect group, but of the entire global community (or at
least the best available representation of it).

3 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970444444444">
The prepositions and verbs which accompany a
landmark in spatial sentences capture that land-
mark’s implicit conceptualisation. We use this im-
plicit conceptualisation, as represented on the web,
to develop two automated classification schemes: a
simple voting classifier and a neural network clas-
sifier. We compile a set of gold standard classifi-
cations in order to evaluate the performance of the
classifiers.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998052">
3.1 Landmarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957075">
A list of 58 landmarks was generated for Mel-
bourne, Australia. The landmarks were chosen to be
uniquely identifiable and recognisable by most in-
habitants of Melbourne.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999534">
3.2 Gold Standard
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998168">
We had annotators use a web interface to uniquely
classify each landmark as either point-, line- or area-
like. Each landmark’s gold standard category was
taken to be the category with the greatest number
of annotator votes. Where the annotations were
split equally between classes, the maximal geomet-
ric class was chosen, which is to say, line was cho-
sen in preference to point, and area was chosen in
preference to line. The rationale for this is that, for
example, a point-like representation is always recov-
erable from a landmark nominally classified as an
area, but not the other way around. Hence the classi-
fication which maintains both pieces of information,
that this landmark may be treated as an area or a
point, was assigned preferentially to the alternative,
that this landmark may only be treated as a point.
Since landmark conceptualisations can depend on
the mode of transport involved, annotators were in-
structed to consider themselves a cyclist who never-
theless behaves like a car by always staying on the
street network. The intention was to elicit conceptu-
alisations based on a modality which is intermediate
between a car and a pedestrian. Annotators were
also asked to indicate their confidence in each anno-
tation.

3.3 Web Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986555555556">
We identified a set of prepositions and verbs as in-
dicating a point-like, line-like or area-like repre-
sentation. The number of documents on the web
which were found to contain a particular landmark
in point-like, line-like or area-like spatial sentences
provided the raw data for our automated classifi-
cation schemes. The web data thus obtained can
be considered an implicit representation of a gen-
eralised cognitive model of the landmarks.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.794124">
Prepositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990448275862">
Landau and Jackendoff (1993) investigated the
use of English spatial prepositions and the require-
ments they place on the geometric properties of ref-
erence objects. This analysis was projected onto the
conceptual classes of point, line and area, to form
a list of conceptually grouped spatial prepositions.
Hence prepositions which require the reference ob-
ject to be (or contain) a bounded enclosure, such
as inside, were classified as denoting an area-like
landmark; prepositions which require the reference
to have an elongated principal axis, such as along,
were classified as denoting a line-like landmark; and
prepositions which place no geometric constraints
on the reference object, such as at, were classified
as denoting a point-like landmark.
The prepositions used were restricted to those
which pertain to a horizontal planar geometry com-
patible with route directions; for example, preposi-
tions which make use of a reference object’s ver-
tical axis such as on top of and under were ig-
nored, as were prepositions denoting contact such
as against. The preposition out was also excluded
from the study as it is typically used in non-spatial
contexts, and in spatial contexts the reference object
is usually covert (eg he took his wallet out) (Tyler
and Evans, 2003). Conversely, out of is frequently
spatial and the reference object is overt, so this com-
pound preposition was retained. The complete list
of prepositions used in the study is given in Table 1.

Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999535">
In addition to the list of prepositions, a list of
verbs was created based on the verb classes of Levin
(1993), restricted to verbs of inherently directed mo-
tion which can be used in a phrase immediately pre-
ceding a landmark, such as the verb pass in the
phrase pass the MCG; in other words, the chosen
verbs can be used in a way which parallels the use
of spatial prepositions, as opposed to verbs such as

sition for clarification. This second type of verb is of
no interest to the study as they tell us nothing about
the conceptualisation of landmarks.
As with the prepositions, the verbs were grouped
into the conceptual classes of point, line and area ac-
cording to the requirements they place on reference
objects, including enter for an area-like object, fol-
low for a line-like object and pass for a point-like
object. The complete list of verbs used in the study
is given in Table 2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.930055">
Document Counts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99968721875">
Each of the prepositions and verbs was com-
bined with each of the landmarks to create a cross-
product of linguistic chunks, such as at Queen Victo-
ria Market, through Queen Victoria Market, and so
on. Alternative names and common misspellings of
the landmark names were taken into account, such
as Flinders St Station, Flinders Street Station and
Flinder’s Street Station. Additionally, three con-
jugations of each verb were used—present tense
non-3rd person singular (eg reach), present tense
3rd person singular (eg reaches), and past tense (eg
reached).
Each linguistic chunk was sent in turn to the
Google search engine, which determined the ap-
proximate number of documents on the web contain-
ing that exact phrase. The counts were then summed
over the conceptual categories in which each prepo-
sition and verb appeared. The result of this was
a probabilistic categorisation of each landmark as
point, line or area, according to its usage in spatial
sentences on the web.
It is difficult to determine the context of sentences
using a search engine. It is uncertain whether the
documents found by Google use the searched-for
linguistic chunks in a spatial context or in some
other context. For this reason, each preposition and
verb was assigned a weight based on the proportion
of occurrences of that word in the Penn Treebank
(Marcus et al., 1993) which are labelled with a spa-
tial meaning. This weighting should give an approx-
imation to the proportion of spatial usages of that
word on the web.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.470585">
Automated Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999908">
As a naive automated classification of the land-
marks, the document counts were used to place each
landmark in one of the three conceptual classes.
Each landmark was placed in the class in which it
was found to appear most frequently, based on the
classes of the prepositions and verbs with which it
appeared on the web. Hence landmarks which ap-
peared more often with a point-like preposition or
verb, such as at or pass, were placed in the point cat-
egory; landmarks which appeared more often with
a line-like preposition or verb, such as follow, were
placed in the line category; and landmarks which ap-
peared more often with an area-like preposition or
verb, such as around, were placed in the area cate-
gory.
As a more sophisticated classification scheme,
we developed a supervised artificial neural network
classifier. The neural network we developed con-
sisted of a three node input layer, a two node hid-
den layer and a two node output layer, with learning

taking place via the backpropagation algorithm. For
each landmark, the percentage of web counts in each
of the three conceptual classes was used as the initial
activation value of the three nodes in the input layer.
The activation of the output nodes was rounded to 1
or 0. The output node activations were used to indi-
cate whether a landmark falls into the point, line or
area category — 01 for point, 10 for line and 11 for
area. An output of 00 was taken to indicate a fail-
ure to classify. The neural network was trained and
tested using fourfold cross-validation, with the gold
standard classification as the desired output in each
case.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942034482759">
Five experiments were conducted on the simple
voting classifier and the neural network classifier.
These experiments used increasingly sophisticated
inputs and gold standard measures to try to im-
prove the performance of the classifiers, as measured
against the gold standard. The neural network clas-
sifier outperformed the voting classifier in all exper-
iments but the final one.
Of the 58 Melbourne landmarks, 27 were clas-
sified as points by the majority of annotators, 2 as
lines, and 29 as areas. These majority classifications
were used as the gold standard. For these classifica-
tions, we calculated a kappa statistic of 0.528 (Car-
letta, 1996). This suggests that the annotation classi-
fication task itself was only moderately well-formed,
and that the assumption that multiple annotators will
classify landmarks in a similar manner does not nec-
essarily hold true.
To determine whether the classifiers were per-
forming at an acceptable level, we established a
majority-class baseline: 29 of the 58 landmarks
were areas, and hence the majority class classifier
has an accuracy of 50%.
The maximum meaningful accuracy that can be
achieved by a classifier is limited by the accuracy
of the annotations themselves, creating an upper
bound for classifier performance. The upper bound
was calculated as the mean pairwise inter-annotator
agreement, which was determined to be 74.4%.

Experiment 1 involved using only the raw web count
data as input into the classifiers. The accuracy and
error rate reduction (E.R.R.) of the classifiers are
given in Table 3.
The neural network classifier produced results
slightly better than the simple voting classifier, but
with 18 landmarks incorrectly classified by the neu-
ral network, there is still plently of room for im-
provement. The raw web count data used in this ex-
periment was likely to be biased in favour of certain
prepositions and verbs, because some of these words
(such as at and in, which each occur in over 7 bil-
lion documents) are much more common than others
(such as beside, which occurs in just over 50 million
documents). This may result in the web counts be-
ing unfairly weighted towards one class or another,
creating classifier bias.
The simple voting classifier showed a tendency
towards point classifications over line or area classi-
fications. The neural network classifier reversed the
bias shown by the simple voting classifier, with the
area class showing high recall but low precision, re-
sulting in a low recall for the point class. Neither of
the two line landmarks were classified correctly; in
fact, none of the landmarks were classified as lines.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996175">
As explained in Section 3.2, the annotators who gen-
erated the gold standard were required to choose one
of point, line or area for each landmark, even if they
were unfamiliar with the landmark. Some of these
annotators may have been forced to guess the ap-
propriate class. As a result, these annotations may
cause the gold standard to lack validity, which could
be one of the barriers to classifier improvement.
In this experiment, a more sound gold standard
was generated by weighting annotators’ classifica-
tions by their familiarity with the landmark. The
effect of this is that the judgement of an annota-
tor who is very familiar with a landmark outweighs
the judgement of an annotator who is less familiar.
Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted again based
on this new gold standard. These repeated exper-
iments are dubbed Experiments 1&apos; and 2&apos; respec-
tively. The results of each of the repeated experi-
ments are shown in Table 5.
The simple voting classifier showed improvement
using the weighted gold standard, with the accura-
cies under Experiments 1&apos; and 2&apos; each exceeding
the accuracy of the equivalent experiment using the
original gold standard. Experiment 1&apos; showed the
most improvement for the simple voting classifier,
giving an accuracy of 67.2% (only one landmark shy
of the 70% accuracy achieved by the neural network
classifier in experiment 1).
While landmarks well-known to all are likely
to produce consistently valid classifications, and
landmarks poorly known to all are likely to pro-
duce consistently invalid classifications, regardless
of whether a weighting scheme is used, it is the land-
marks which are well-known to some and poorly
known to others which should have gained the great-
est benefit from annotations weighted by familiarity.
However, the majority of such landmarks were al-
ready being classified correctly by the neural net-
work in both Experiments 1 and 2, which explains
why the neural network showed no improvement.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988921052631">
Surprisingly, the naive conditions in Experiment 1
produced the best overall result, which was a 70%
accuracy for the neural network classifier. Although
the voting classifier and the neural network classi-
fier produced similar levels of accuracy for many of
the experiments, there was very little overlap in the
landmarks that were correctly assigned by each clas-
sifier. Of the 40 landmarks correctly assigned by the
neural network, 18 were incorrectly classified by the
voting classifier. Conversely, of the 37 landmarks
correctly assigned by the voting classifier, 15 were
incorrectly assigned by the neural network. This in-
dicates that the neural net is doing something more
sophisticated than simply assigning each landmark
to its maximum category.
A rather large subset of the landmarks was found
to be consistently misclassified by the neural net,
under various training conditions. For a number of
these landmarks, the annotators showed strong dis-
agreement and indicated that the landmark is am-
biguous, suggesting that there is indeed an inherent
ambiguity in the way these landmarks are concep-
tualised, both between annotators and on the web.
Interestingly, all of the hospitals in the landmark list
were consistently misclassified. A number of anno-
tators expressed confusion with regard to these land-
marks, as to whether the hospital itself or the sur-
rounding gardens should be taken into account. As a
result, annotations of the hospitals tended to be split
between point and area.
However, some of the landmarks that were mis-
classified by the neural net were classified consis-
tently by the annotators — for example, GPO was
classified as a point by all of the Melbourne an-
notators. The ambiguity here presumably lies in
the web counts, which were not able to detect the
same conceptualisation generated by the annotators.
One complication with using web counts is the fact

that the data is global in scope, and with a simple
abbreviation like GPO, there may well be interfer-
ence from documents which do not refer to the Mel-
bourne landmark, and in fact may not refer to a land-
mark or spatial object at all.
One of the underlying assumptions of the study
was that all landmarks can be represented as falling
into exactly one of the three conceptual classes —
point, line or area. This may be an oversimplifica-
tion. Some landmarks may in fact be more proto-
typical or ambiguous than others. Certainly, a num-
ber of the landmark annotations were split almost
equally between point, line and area. It may be that
annotators did not or could not take upon themselves
the mentality of a cyclist as requested in the annota-
tion instructions, and instead simply conceptualised
the landmarks as they usually would, whether that
entails a pedestrian or car modality, or some alterna-
tive such as a train or tram-like modality. It may also
be the case that there are individual differences in
the way people conceptualise certain types of land-
marks, or indeed space in general, regardless of the
modality involved. If this is true, then the low inter-
annotator agreement may be a product of these indi-
vidual differences and not merely an artifact of the
experiment design.
In summary, we have proposed a method for clas-
sifying landmarks according to whether they are
most point-like, line-like or area-like, for use in the
generation of route descriptions. Our method re-
lies crucially on analysis of what prepositions and
verbs the landmarks co-occur with in web data. In a
series of experiments, we showed that we are able
to achieve accuracy levels nearing inter-annotator
agreement levels for the task.
One simplification made during the course of this
study was the treatment of parks and districts as be-
ing comparable entities (i.e. area-like landmarks). In
fact, a distinction may be made between open areas
such as districts, with which the preposition through
may be used, and closed areas such as parks, for
which through does not apply for car navigation (al-
though obviously does apply for pedestrian naviga-
tion). We hope to take this into account in future
work.

Typically, automated navigation systems give turning instructions with street names as reference points, eg turn right at Smith St. By contrast, human-generated route instructions tend to use landmarks in preference to street names as navigational reference points (Michon and Denis, 2001). According to Allen (1997), landmarks are typically used in route directions in one of two ways— as descriptives, providing a static picture of a spatial scene so that the traveller can verify his or her location along a route, eg the City Library is on your left, or to specify or clarify a point on a route at which the traveller must make a choice between multiple pathways, termed choice points or decision points. Route instructions which identify decision points with respect to landmarks have been found to be significantly easier to follow than standard streetbased or turn-based route instructions (Michon and Denis, </context>

These experiments used increasingly sophisticated inputs and gold standard measures to try to improve the performance of the classifiers, as measured against the gold standard. The neural network classifier outperformed the voting classifier in all experiments but the final one. Of the 58 Melbourne landmarks, 27 were classified as points by the majority of annotators, 2 as lines, and 29 as areas. These majority classifications were used as the gold standard. For these classifications, we calculated a kappa statistic of 0.528 (Carletta, 1996). This suggests that the annotation classification task itself was only moderately well-formed, and that the assumption that multiple annotators will classify landmarks in a similar manner does not necessarily hold true. To determine whether the classifiers were performing at an acceptable level, we established a majority-class baseline: 29 of the 58 landmarks were areas, and hence the majority class classifier has an accuracy of 50%. The maximum meaningful accuracy that can be achieved by a classifier is limited by the accuracy of the annotations themselves, creating an upper bound for classi</context>

On a geometric level, all landmarks can be considered areas when projected onto a top-down map. However, on a conceptual level, landmarks can be used in a point-like, line-like or area-like manner, depending on their spatial relationship with a route (Hansen et al., 2006). One possible approach to determining a landmark’s conceptual class is to make use of the landmark’s geometric context, including its size relative to the route and the number of decision points with which it coincides. However, this approach may have little ecological validity, as people may not in fact conceptualise landmarks as point, line or area based purely on geometry, but also based on pragmatic considerations. For instance, it may be the case that people don’t tend to conceptualise Flinders St Station as an area, even though it satisfies the geometric criteria. 2.3 Past Research on L</context>

In an investigation of the spatial use of landmarks in sentences, Tezuka and Tanaka (2005) modified existing web mining methods to include spatial context in order to obtain landmark information. It is natural to question the appropriateness of web data for research purposes, because web data is inevitably noisy and search engines themselves can introduce certain idiosyncracies which can distort results (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). However, the vast amount of data available can nevertheless give better results than more theoretically motivated techniques (Lapata and Keller, 2004).

Optimally, route directions should exhibit cognitive adequacy — characterising an external representation of a route (as with a map or route directions) in a way supportive of human spatial cognitive processes and knowledge representation (Klippel, 2003). For this reason, the improvement of route directions requires an investigation into human spatial cognition. Route instructions which reference landmarks are able to achieve a number of worthwhile goals: they have the effect of increasing the spatial awareness of the recipient by informing them about their surroundings; landmark-referencing route instructions can decrease the cognitive load on the recipient; and it is more natural-sounding to receive route instructions in terms of landmarks. 2.2 Landmark Conceptualisation In order to provide appropriate landmark-referenced route instructions</context>

Instead, we aim to find appropriate ways of classifying landmarks automatically, based on the way those landmarks are used in spatial sentences on the web: as point-like, linear-like, and area-like objects that structure movement pattern in urban spaces. In particular, we analyse how different prepositions and verbs with pre-classified semantics co-occur with mentions of the landmarks. A preposition such as through can be used with reference to a landmark we are conceptualising as an area, but not one we are conceptualising as a point. Landau and Jackendoff (1993) presented an analysis of the spatial properties of commonly used English spatial prepositions, such as at, in and to.

The number of documents on the web which were found to contain a particular landmark in point-like, line-like or area-like spatial sentences provided the raw data for our automated classification schemes. The web data thus obtained can be considered an implicit representation of a generalised cognitive model of the landmarks. Prepositions Landau and Jackendoff (1993) investigated the use of English spatial prepositions and the requirements they place on the geometric properties of reference objects. This analysis was projected onto the conceptual classes of point, line and area, to form a list of conceptually grouped spatial prepositions. Hence prepositions which require the reference object to be (or contain) a bounded enclosure, such as inside, were classified as denoting an area-like landmark; prepositions which require the reference to have an elongated principal axis, such as along, were classified as denoting a line-like landmark; and prepositions w</context>

The result of this was a probabilistic categorisation of each landmark as point, line or area, according to its usage in spatial sentences on the web. It is difficult to determine the context of sentences using a search engine. It is uncertain whether the documents found by Google use the searched-for linguistic chunks in a spatial context or in some other context. For this reason, each preposition and verb was assigned a weight based on the proportion of occurrences of that word in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) which are labelled with a spatial meaning. This weighting should give an approximation to the proportion of spatial usages of that word on the web.

Typically, automated navigation systems give turning instructions with street names as reference points, eg turn right at Smith St. By contrast, human-generated route instructions tend to use landmarks in preference to street names as navigational reference points (Michon and Denis, 2001). According to Allen (1997), landmarks are typically used in route directions in one of two ways— as descriptives, providing a static picture of a spatial scene so that the traveller can verify his or her location along a route, eg the City Library is on your left, or to specify or clarify a point on a route at which the traveller must make a choice between multiple pathways, termed choice points or decision points. Route instructions which identify decision points with respect to landmarks have been found to be significantly easier to follow than standard streetbased or turn-based route instr</context>

However, this approach may have little ecological validity, as people may not in fact conceptualise landmarks as point, line or area based purely on geometry, but also based on pragmatic considerations. For instance, it may be the case that people don’t tend to conceptualise Flinders St Station as an area, even though it satisfies the geometric criteria. 2.3 Past Research on Landmark Interpretation The only research we are aware of which has addressed this same topic of landmark interpretation is that of Tezuka and Tanaka (2005). In an investigation of the spatial use of landmarks in sentences, Tezuka and Tanaka (2005) modified existing web mining methods to include spatial context in order to obtain landmark information. It is natural to question the appropriateness of web data for research purposes, because web data is inevitably noisy and search engines themselves can introduce certain idiosyncracies which can distort results (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). However, the vast amount of data available can nevertheless give better results than more theoretically motivated techniques (Lapata and Keller, 2004). An</context>

The prepositions used were restricted to those which pertain to a horizontal planar geometry compatible with route directions; for example, prepositions which make use of a reference object’s vertical axis such as on top of and under were ignored, as were prepositions denoting contact such as against. The preposition out was also excluded from the study as it is typically used in non-spatial contexts, and in spatial contexts the reference object is usually covert (eg he took his wallet out) (Tyler and Evans, 2003). Conversely, out of is frequently spatial and the reference object is overt, so this compound preposition was retained. The complete list of prepositions used in the study is given in Table 1. Verbs In addition to the list of prepositions, a list of verbs was created based on the verb classes of Levin (1993), restricted to verbs of inherently directed motion which can be used in a phrase immediately preceding a landmark, such as the verb pass in the phrase pass the MCG; in other words, the chosen verbs can be used in a way which parallels the use of spatial prepositions, as opposed to verbs s</context>
