<bodyText confidence="0.999615933333333">
This paper presents the task definition, re-
sources, and the single participant system
for Task 12: Turkish Lexical Sample Task
(TLST), which was organized in the Se-
mEval-2007 evaluation exercise. The
methodology followed for developing the
specific linguistic resources necessary for
the task has been described in this context.
A language-specific feature set was defined
for Turkish. TLST consists of three pieces
of data: The dictionary, the training data,
and the evaluation data. Finally, a single
system that utilizes a simple statistical
method was submitted for the task and
evaluated.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999485818181818">
Effective parameters for word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) may vary for different languages and
word types. Although, some parameters are com-
mon in many languages, some others may be lan-
guage specific. Turkish is an interesting language
that deserves being examined semantically. Turk-
ish is based upon suffixation, which differentiates
it sharply from the majority of European languages,
and many others. Like all Turkic languages, Turk-
ish is agglutinative, that is, grammatical functions
are indicated by adding various suffixes to stems.
Turkish has a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) sentence
structure but other orders are possible under certain
discourse situations. As a SOV language where
objects precede the verb, Turkish has postpositions
rather than prepositions, and relative clauses that
precede the verb. Turkish, as a widely-spoken lan-
guage, is appropriate for semantic researches.
TLST utilizes some resources that are explained
in Section 2-5. In Section 6 evaluation of the sys-
tem is provided. In section 7 some concluding re-
marks and future work are discussed.

2 Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999758142857143">
Lesser studied languages, such as Turkish suffer
from the lack of wide coverage electronic re-
sources or other language processing tools like on-
tologies, dictionaries, morphological analyzers,
parsers etc. There are some projects for providing
data for NLP applications in Turkish like METU
Corpus Project (Oflazer et al., 2003). It has two
parts, the main corpus and the treebank that con-
sists of parsed, morphologically analyzed and dis-
ambiguated sentences selected from the main cor-
pus, respectively. The sentences are given in XML
format and provide many syntactic features that
can be helpful for WSD. This corpus and treebank
can be used for academic purposes by contract.
The texts in main corpus have been taken from
different types of Turkish written texts published
in 1990 and afterwards. It has about two million
words. It includes 999 written texts taken from 201
books, 87 papers and news from 3 different Turk-
ish daily newspapers. XML and Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) style annotation have been used.
The distribution of the texts in the Treebank is
similar to the main corpus. There are 6930 sen-
tences in this Treebank. These sentences have been
parsed, morphologically analyzed and disambigu-
ated. In Turkish, a word can have more than one
analysis, so having disambiguated texts is very
important.

Frequencies of the words have been found as it
is necessary to select appropriate ambiguous words
for WSD. There are 5356 different root words and
627 of these words have 15 or more occurrences,
and the rest have less.
The XML files contains tagging information in
the word (morphological analysis) and sentence
level as a parse tree as shown in Figure 1. In the
word level, inflectional forms are provided. And in
the sentence level relations among words are
given. The S tag is for sentence and W tag is for
the word. IX is used for index of the word in the
sentence, LEM is left as blank and lemma is given
in the MORPH tag as a part of it with the morpho-
logical analysis of the word. REL is for parsing
information. It consists of three parts, two numbers
and a relation. For example REL=&amp;quot;[2, 1, (MODI-
FIER)]&amp;quot; means this word is modifying the first in-
flectional group of the second word in the sen-
tence. The structure of the treebank data was de-
signed by METU. Initially lemmas were decided to
be provided as a tag by itself, however, lemmas are
left as blank. This does not mean that lemmas are
not available in the treebank; the lemmas are given
as a part of “IG” tag. Programs are available for
extracting this information for the time being. All
participants can get these programs and thereby the
lemmas easily and instantly.
The sense tags were not included in the treebank
and had to be added manually. Sense tagging has
been checked in order to obtain gold standard data.
Initial tagging process has been finished by a sin-
gle tagger and controlled. Two other native speaker
in the team tagged and controlled the examples.
That is, this step was completed by three taggers.
Problematic cases were handled by a commission
and the decision was finalized when about 90%
agreement has been reached.

3 Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996193">
The dictionary is the one that is published by
TDK1 (Turkish Language Foundation) and it is
open to public via internet. This dictionary lists the
senses along with their definitions and example
sentences that are provided for some senses. The
dictionary is used only for sense tagging and
enumeration of the senses for standardization. No
specific information other than the sense numbers
is taken from the dictionary; therefore there is no
need for linguistic processing of the dictionary.

4 Training and Evaluation Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999901">
In Table 1 statistical information about the final
training and testing sets of TLST is summarized.
The data have been provided for 3 words in the
trial set and 26 words in the final training and test-
ing sets (10 nouns, 10 verbs and 6 other POS for
the rest of POS including adjectives and adverbs).
It has been tagged about 100 examples per word,
but the number of samples is incremented or dec-
remented depending on the number of senses that
specific word has. For a few words, however,
fewer examples exist due to the sparse distribution
of the data. Some ambiguous words had fewer ex-
amples in the corpus, therefore they were either
eliminated or some other examples drawn from
external resources were added in the same format.
On the average, the selected words have 6.7
senses, verbs, however, have more. Approximately
70% of the examples for each word were delivered
as training data, whereas approximately 30% was
reserved as evaluation data. The distribution of the
senses in training and evaluation data has been
kept proportional. The sets are given as plain text
files for each word under each POS. The samples
for the words that can belong to more than one
POS are listed under the majority class. POS is
provided for each sample.
We have extracted example sentences of the tar-
get word(s) and some features from the XML files.
Then tab delimited text files including structural
and sense tag information are obtained. In these
files each line has contextual information that are
thought to be effective (Orhan and Altan, 2006;
Orhan and Altan, 2005) in Turkish WSD about the
target words. In the upper level for each of them
XML file id, sentence number and the order of the
ambiguous word are kept as a unique key for that
specific target. In the sentence level, three catego-
ries of information, namely the features related to
the previous words, target word itself and the sub-
sequent words in the context are provided.

In the treebank relational structure, there can be
more than one word in the previous context related
to the target, however there is only a single word in
the subsequent one. Therefore the data for all
words in the previous context is provided sepa-
rately. The features that are employed for previous
and the subsequent words are the same and they
are the root word, POS(corrected), tags for ontol-
ogy level 1, level 2 and level 3, POS, inflected
POS, case marker, possessor and relation. How-
ever for the target word only the root word, POS,
inflected POS, case marker, possessor and relation
are taken into consideration. Fine and coarse-
grained (FG and CG respectively) sense numbers
and the sentence that has the ambiguous word have
been added as the last three feature. FG senses are
the ones that are decided to be the exact senses.
CG senses are given as a set that are thought to be
possible alternatives in addition to the FG sense.

provided in a single line of data files along with an

5 Ontology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974954545455">
A small scale ontology for the target words and
their context was constructed. The Turkish Word-
Net developed at Sabancı University2 is somehow
insufficient. Only the verbs have some levels of
relations similar to English WordNet. The nouns,
adjectives, adverbs and other words that are fre-
quently used in Turkish and in the context of the
ambiguous words were not included. This is not a
suitable resource for fulfilling the requirements of
TLST and an ontology specific to this task was
required. The ontology covers the examples that
are selected and has three levels of relations that
are supposed to be effective in the disambiguation
process. We tried to be consistent with the Word-
Net tags; additionally we constructed the ontology
not only for nouns and verbs but for all the words
that are in the context of the ambiguous words se-
lected. Additionally we tried to strengthen the rela-
tion among the context words by using the same
tags for all POS in the ontology. This is somehow
deviating from WordNet methodology, since each
word category has its own set of classification in it.

WSD is a new area of research in Turkish. The
sense tagged data provided in TLST are the first
resources for this specific domain in Turkish. Due
to the limited and brand new resources available
and the time restrictions the participation was less.
We submitted a very simple system that utilizes
statistical information. It is similar to the Naïve
Bayes approach. The features in the training data
was used individually and the probababilities of
the senses are calculated. Then in the test phase the
probabilities of each sense is calculated with the
given features and the three highest-scored senses
are selected as the answer. The average precision
and recall values for each word category are given

in Table 3. The values are not so high, as it can be
expected. The size of the training data is limited,
but the size is the highest possible under these cir-
cumstances, but it should be incremented in the
near future. The number of senses is high and pro-
viding enough instances is difficult. The data and
the methodology for WSD will be improved by the
experience obtained in SemEval evaluation exer-
cise.
The evaluation is done only for FG and CG
senses. For FG senses no partial points are as-
signed and 1 point is assigned for a correct match.
On the other hand, the CG senses are evaluated
partially. If the answer tags are matching with any
of the answer tags they are given points.

In TLST we have prepared the first resources for

resources and methodology have some deficien-
