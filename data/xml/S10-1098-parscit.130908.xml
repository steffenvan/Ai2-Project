In this paper, we describe the system we de-
veloped for the SemEval-2010 task of disam-
biguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives
(hereinafter referred to SAA). Our system cre-
ated a new word library named SAA-Oriented
Library consisting of positive words, negative
words, negative words related to SAA, posi-
tive words related to SAA, and inverse words,
etc. Based on the syntactic parsing, we ana-
lyzed the relationship between SAA and the
keywords and handled other special processes
by extracting such words in the relevant sen-
tences to disambiguate sentiment ambiguous
adjectives. Our micro average accuracy is
0.942, which puts our system in the first place.

<bodyText confidence="0.999848142857143">
We participated in disambiguating sentiment
ambiguous adjectives task of SemEval-2010(Wu
and Jin, 2010).
Together 14 sentiment ambiguous adjectives
are chosen by the task organizers, which are all
high-frequency words in Mandarin Chinese.
They are: );z|big, /JN|small, J�|many, �|few, A
|high, 9 |low, 1*- |thick, 14|thin, M, |deep, &amp;
|shallow, * |heavy, 轻 |light, V_E );z |huge, * );z
|grave. These adjectives are neutral out of con-
text, but when they co-occur with some target
nouns, positive or negative emotion will be
evoked. The task is designed to automatically
determine the semantic orientation of these sen-
timent ambiguous adjectives within context:
positive or negative (Wu and Jin, 2010). For in-
stance, “ Ift A |the price is high” indicates
negative meaning, while “质-R�|the quality is
high” has positive connotation.
Considering the grammar system of contem-
porary Chinese, a word is one of the most basic
linguistic granularities consisting of a sentence.
Therefore, as for the sentiment classification of a
sentence, the sentiment tendency of a sentence
can be identified on the basis of that of a word.
Wiebe et al. (2004) proposed that whether a sen-
tence is subjective or objective should be dis-
criminated according to the adjectives in it. On
the basis of General Inquirer Dictionary, A
Learner’s Dictionary of Positive and Negative
Words, HowNet , A Dictionary of Positive Words
and A Dictionary of Negative Words etc., Wang
et al.(2009) built a word library for Chinese sen-
timent words to discriminate the sentiment cate-
gory of a sentence using the weighted linear
combination method.
Unlike the previous researches which have not
taken SAA into consideration specially in dis-
criminating the sentiment tendency of a sentence,
in the SemEval-2010 task of disambiguating sen-
timent ambiguous adjectives, systems have to
predict the sentiment tendency of these fourteen
adjectives within specific context.
From the view of linguistics, first we devel-
oped a SAA–oriented keyword library, then ana-
lyzed the relationship between the keywords in
the clauses and SAA, and classified its positive
or negative meaning of SAA by extracting the
clauses related to SAA in the sentence.

2 SAAOL

<bodyText confidence="0.9998966">
We create a SAA-oriented library marked as
SAAOL which is made up of positive and nega-
tive words irrelevant to context, negative words
related to SAA (NSAA), positive words related
to SAA (PSAA), and inverse words. The above
five categories of words are called keywords for
short in the paper.
Positive and negative words irrelevant to con-
text refer to the traditional positive or negative
words which are gathered from The Dictionary

of Positive Words(Shi, 2005), The Dictionary of
Negative Words(Yang, 2005), HowNet 1 and
other network resources, such as Terms of Ad-
verse Drug Reaction, Codes of Diseases and
Symptoms, etc.
Distinguishing from the traditional positive
and negative words, NSAA and PSAA in our
SAAOL refer to those positive and negative
words which are related to SAA, yet not classi-
fied into the positive and negative words irrele-
vant to context mentioned above.
We divide SAA into two categories: A cate-
gory and B category listed in Table 1.

We identify whether a word belongs to NSAA
or not on the following principle: any words
when used with A category are negative; con-
versely, when used with B category, they are
positive.
For example, in the following clauses,
“油价很高|oil prices are high”,
“责任重大|the responsibility is important”,
“任务很重 |the task is very heavy”,
“工作量很大|the workload is very large”,
“油价|oil prices”, “责任|responsibility”, “任
务|task”, “工作量|workload” are NSAA.
Correspondingly, we identify whether a word
belongs to PSAA or not on the following princi-
ple: any words when used with A category are
positive; however, when used with B category,
they are negative.
In the clauses,
“粮食很多 |much food”,
“效率极低 |efficiency is extremely low”,
“存款利率高|interest rate on deposit is high”,
“粮食 |food”, “效率 |efficiency”, “存款利率
|interest rate on deposit” are PSAA.
In general, when two negative words are used
together, the sentiment tendency that they show
is negative. For instances, “ 糖 尿 病 发 病 率

|incidence of diabetes”, “病毒感染|virus infec-
tion”, “战争破坏|destruction of wars”. However,
in certain cases, some words play a part in elimi-
nating negative meaning when used with nega-
tive words, for example, “ 反 |anti-” , “ 抑 制
|restrain”, “ 避 免 |avoid”, “ 抗 |resist”, “ 降 低
|reduce”, “降幅|fall”, “减少|decrease”, “控制
|control”, “成本|cost”, “反对|oppose”, “下调
|decrease”, “非|non-”, “不|not”. These special
words are called inverse words in our SAAOL.
In the following instances, “减轻伤害|reduce
the injury”, “抑制通胀 |curb inflation”, “反战
|anti-war”, the words “伤害|injury”, “抑制 |infla-
tion”, and “ 战争|war” themselves are all nega-
tive. When used with the inverse words“减轻
|reduce ”, “抑制 |curb”, “反|anti-”, they express
positive meaning instead.
On the basis of the above collected word li-
brary, we discriminate manually the positive and
negative meaning, PSAA, NSAA, and inverse
words in 50,000 Chinese words according to
Richard Xiao’s Top 50,000 Chinese Word Fre-
quency List, which collects the frequency of the
top 50000 Chinese words covered in the just
published frequency dictionary of Mandarin
Chinese based on a balanced corpus of ca. 50
million words. The list is available at

zip.
Based on HowNet lexical semantic similarity
computing(Liu, 2002), Yang and Wu(2009) se-
lected the new positive and negative bench-mark
words to identify the sentiment tendency by
adopting the improved benchmark words and the
modified method of computing similarity be-
tween words and benchmark words. Their ac-
curacy rate arrived at 98.94%.
In light of the errors of manual calibration, we
extended the keywords in SAAOL by applying
Yang and Wu’s (2009) method and added syn-
onymic and antonymous words in it. Eventually
we proofread and revised manually the new ex-
tended keywords.

According to the structural characteristics of the
sentence, the sentence can be divided into simple
sentences and complex sentences. A simple sen-
tence consists of a single clause which contains a
subject and a predicate and stands alone as its
own sentence. However, a complex sentence is
the one which is linked by conjunctions or con-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999915303030303">
sists of at least two or more clauses without any
conjunctions in it.
A complicated sentence in structure is divided
into several clauses in accordance with punctua-
tions, such as a full stop, or a exclamatory mark,
or a comma, or a semicolon, etc. We analyze the
syntax of the clause by extracting the clause in-
cluding SAA and the adjacent one. We extract
SAAOL keywords in the selected clauses, and
then analyze the grammatical relationship be-
tween the keywords and SAA.
Wang et al’s research of extraction technology
based on the dependency relation of Chinese sen-
timental elements indicated that the dependency
analyzer designed by Stanford University had not
showed a high rate of accuracy. And the wrong
dependency relation will interfere with the sub-
sequent parsing process seriously (Wang, et al.,
2009).
Taking the above factors into consideration,
we have not analyzed the dependency relation at
present. Through studying abundant instances,
we specialize in the structural relationship be-
tween the keywords and SAA to extract the rela-
tion patterns which have a higher occurrence fre-
quency. In the meantime, inverse words are proc-
essed particularly. Eventually we supplemented
modification of the inaccuracy of automatic
segmented words and some special adverbs, such
as 偏 |prejudiced, ii|excessive, 太|too.
To sum up, based on the word library SAAOL
and structural analysis, SAA classification pro-
cedures are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9952960625">
• Step 1 Extract unidentified clauses in-
cluding SAA;
• Step 2 Extract the keywords in SAAOL
from the clause;
• Step 3 Label the sentiment tendency of
each sentiment word by using SAAOL;
• Step 4 Discriminate the positive or nega-
tive meaning of a sentence in accordance
with the different relationships. If there are
no keywords in the sentence, perform step
5; otherwise, discrimination is over.
• Step 5 Extract the clauses next to SAA,
and identify them according to Steps 2-4.
If there are no extractable clauses, mark
them as SAA which will be recognized. A
is for the positives, and B for the negatives.

In disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjec-
tives task of SemEval-2010, there are 2917 in-
stances in test data for 14 Chinese sentiment am-
biguous adjectives. According to the official re-
sult of the task, our micro average accuracy is
0.942, which puts our system in the first position
among the participants.
Depending upon the answers from organizers
of the task, we notice that errors occur mainly in
the following cases.
Firstly, there is a key word related to SAA, but
it has no such key word in our SAAOL.
For instance,
X414;0*1#P—Q-h pf 1)41�&amp;&lt;head&gt;n
&lt;/head&gt;OK  |Why is the usage rate of pf so high
in my computer?
ipf 1)41 |The usage rate of pf” should be
NSAA, but it does not exist in our SAAOL.
Secondly, the sentence itself is too compli-
cated to be analyzed effectively in our system so
far.
Thirdly, as the imperfection of SAAOL itself,
there are some inevitable mistakes in it.
For instance,
lk P%71cL4-P.044&apos; Af_t&amp;&lt;head&gt;),Z
&lt;/head&gt;  |The diver’s feat is extremely difficult.
It is generally known that if the bigger the dif-
ficulty of the dive is, the better the diver’s per-
formance will be, both of which are of propor-
tional relation. However, generally speaking, the
degree of difficulty is negative. For this reason,
we made a mistake in such instance.
