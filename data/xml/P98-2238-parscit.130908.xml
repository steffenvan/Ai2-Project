<bodyText confidence="0.9993815">
Machine Translation (MT) need not be
confined to inter-language activities. In this
paper, we discuss inter-dialect MT in
general and Cantonese-Mandarin MT in
particular. Mandarin and Cantonese are two
most important dialects of Chinese. The
former is the national lingua franca and the
latter is the most influential dialect in South
China, Hong Kong and overseas. The
difference in between is such that mutual
intelligibility is impossible. This paper
presents, from a computational point of view,
a comparative study of Mandarin and
Cantonese at the three aspects of sound
systems, grammar rules and vocabulary
contents, followed by a discussion of the
design and implementation of a dialect MT
system between them.

<bodyText confidence="0.999358235294118">
Automatic Machine Translation (MT) between
different languages, such as English, Chinese
and Japanese, has been an attractive but
extremely difficult research area. Over forty
years of MT history has seen limited practical
translation systems developed or
commercialized in spite of the considerable
development in computer science and linguistic
studies. High quality machine translation
between two languages requires deep
understanding of the intended meaning of the
source language sentences, which in turn
involves disambiguation reasoning based on
intelligent searches and proper uses of a great
amount of relevant knowledge, including
common sense (Nirenburg, et. al. 1992). The
task is so demanding that some researchers are
looking more seriously at machine-aided human
translation as an alternative way to achieve
automatic machine translation (Martin, 1997a,
1997b).
Translation or interpretation is not necessarily
an inter-language activity. In many cases, it
happens among dialects within a single language.
Similarly, MT can be inter-dialect as well. In
fact, automatic translation or interpretation
seems much more practical and achievable here
since inter-dialect difference is much less
serious than inter-language difference. Inter-
dialect MT&apos; also represents a promising market,
especially in China. In the following sections we
will discuss inter-dialect MT with special
emphasis on the pair of Chinese Cantonese and
Chinese Mandarin.

1 Dialects and Chinese Dialects
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996616">
Dialects of a language are that language&apos;s
systematic variations, developed when people of
a common language are separated
geographically and socially. Among this group
of dialects, normally one serves as the lingua
franca, namely, the common language medium
for communication among speakers of different
dialects. Inter-dialect differences exist in
pronunciation, vocabulary and syntactic rules.
However, they are usually insignificant in
comparison with the similarities the dialects
have. It has been declared that dialects of one
language are mutually intelligible (Fromkin and
Rodman 1993, p. 276).
Nevertheless, this is not true to the situation
in China. There are seven major Chinese dialects:
the Northern Dialect (with Mandarin as its
standard version), Cantonese, Wu, Min, Halcka,
Xiang and Gan (Yuan, 1989), that for the most
part are mutually unintelligible, and inter-dialect

translation is often found indispensable for
successful communication, especially between
Cantonese, the most popular and the most
influential dialect in South China and overseas,
and Mandarin, the lingual franca of China.

2 Linguistic Consideration of Dialect

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962766583333333">
Most differences among the dialects of a
language are found in their sound inventory and
phonological systems. Words with similar
written forms are often pronounced differently
in different dialects. For example, the same
Chinese word &amp;quot; &amp;quot; (Hong Kong) is
pronounced xianglgang32 in Mandarin, but
hoenglgong2 in Cantonese. There are also
lexical differences although dialects share most
of their words. Different dialects may use
different words to refer to the same thing. For
example, the word &amp;quot;umbrella&amp;quot; is M.
(yu3san3) in Mandarin, and I (zel) in
Cantonese. Differences in syntactic structure are
less common but they are linguistically more
complicated and computationally more
challenging. For example, the positions of some
adverbs may vary from dialect to dialect. To
express &amp;quot;You go first&amp;quot;, we have
Mandarin:
VI; 5
ni 3 xianl zou3 (1)
you first go
Cantonese:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.874917">
41-
nei5 hang4 sinl (2)
you go first
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99905825">
Comparative sentences represent another case
where syntactic difference is likely to happen.
For example the English sentence &amp;quot;A is taller
than B&amp;quot; is expressed as
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.901860333333333">
Mandarin:
A LL
A bi3 B gaol (3)
</figure>
<footnote confidence="0.990596">
2 In this paper, pronunciation of Mandarin is
presented in Hanyu Pinyin Scheme (LICASS, 1996),
and Cantonese in Yueyu Pinyin Scheme (LSHK,
1997). Numbers are used to denote tones of syllables.
Yueyu Pinyin is based on Hanyu Pinyin. That means,
across the two pinyin schemes, words with different
pinyin symbols are normally pronounced differently.

Cantonese:

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985645">
Sentences with double objects often follow
different word orders, too. In a Mandarin
sentence with two objects, the one referring to
person(s) must be put before the other one. Yet,
many dialects allow the order to be reversed, for
example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.891411333333333">
Mandarin:
11C 5t
wo3 xianl gei3 tal qian2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988062666666667">
I first give him money
I will give him some money first.
Cantonese:

<equation confidence="0.9723235">
4t fT CI 5t
ngo3 bei2 cin4 keoi5 sinl
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.949359869565218">
I give money him first
Differences in word pronunciation and word
forms can be represented in a bi-dialect
dictionary. For example, for Cantonese-
Mandarin MT, we can use entries like
word(pron, [1/1-■, ni3], [1/11, nei5]) %you
word(vi,[1, zou3], hang4]) %go
word(n,[ff, hang2], [4T., hang4]) %row
word(adv, [5t , xianl] , [A , sinl]) %first
word(n, yu3san3],[A, ze 1]) %ubbrella
where the word entry flag &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is followed by
three arguments: the part of speech and the
corresponding words (in Chinese characters and
pinyins) in Mandarin and in Cantonese. English
comments are marked with &amp;quot;%&amp;quot;.
Morphologically, there are some useful rules
for word formation. For example, in Mandarin,
the prefixes &amp;quot;le (gong 1) and &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; (xiong2)
are for male animals, and &amp;quot; &amp;quot; (mu3) and
1111 &amp;quot;(ci2) female animals. But in most southern
China dialects, the suffixes &amp;quot;/#&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;t1/4&amp;quot;
are often used instead. For examples
bull/ox:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.664512285714286">
Mandarin !kit- (gonglniul),
Cantonese 4 (ngau4gung1),
cow:
Mandarin ill (mu3niu2) ,
Cantonese fi (ngau4naa2).
And Cantonese &amp;quot;pir is for calling, e. g. ,
Daddy:

Elder brother:
JgJ (Cantonese), (Mandarin).
The problem caused by syntactic difference can
be tackled with linguistic rules, for example, the
rules below can be used for Cantonese-Mandarin
MT of the previous example sentences:
Rule 1: NP xian 1 VP &lt;--&gt; NP VP sin 1
NP first VP &lt;--&gt; NP VP first
Rule 2: bi3 NP ADJP &lt;--&gt; ADJP go3 NP
than more
Rule 3: gei3 (%give) Operson Othing
bei2 (%give) Othing Operson
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99098784">
Inter-dialect syntactic differences largely
exists in word orders, the key task for MT is to
decide what part(s) of the source sentence
should be moved, and to where. It seems
unlikely for words to be moved over long
distances, because dialects normally exist in
spoken, short sentences.
Another problem to be considered is whether
dialect MT should be direct or indirect, i.e.,
should there be an intermediate language/dialect?
It seems indirect MT with the lingua franca as
the intermediate representation medium is
promising. The advantage is twofold: (a) good
for multi-dialect MT; (b) more useful and
practical as a lingua franca is a common and the
most influential dialect in the family, and maybe
the only one with a complete written system.
Still another problem is the forms of the
source and target dialects for the MT program.
Most MT systems nowadays translate between
written languages, others are trying speech-to-
speech translation. For dialects MT, translation
between written sentences is not that admirable
because the dialects of a language virtually share
a common written system. On the other hand,
speech to speech translation involves speech
recognition and speech generation, which is a
challenging research area by itself. It is
worthwhile to take a middle way: translation at
the level of phonetic symbols. There are at least
three major reasons: (a) The largest difference
among dialects exists in sound systems. (b)
Phonetic symbol translation is a prerequisite for
speech translation. (c) Some dialect words can
only be represented in sound. In our case,
pinyins have been selected to represent both
input and output sentences, because in China
pinyins are the most popular tools to learn
dialects and to input Chinese characters to
computers. Chinese pinyin schemes, for
Mandarin and for ordinary dialects are
romanized, i.e., they virtually only use English
letters, to the convenience of computer
processing. Of course, pinyin-to-pinyin
translation is more difficult than translation
between written words in Chinese block
characters because the former involves
linguistics analysis at all the three aspects of
sound systems, grammar rules and vocabulary
contents in stead of two.

3 The Problem of Ambiguities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999638055555555">
Ambiguity is always the most crucial and the
most challenging problem for MT. Since inter-
dialect differences mostly exist in words, both in
pronunciation and in characters, our discussion
will concentrate on word disambiguation for
Cantonese-Mandarin MT. In the Cantonese
vocabulary, there are about seven thousand to
eight thousand dialect words (including idioms
and fixed phrases), i.e., those words with
different character forms from any Mandarin
words, or with meanings different from the
Mandarin words of similar forms. These dialect
words account for about one third of the total
Cantonese vocabulary. In spoken Cantonese the
frequency of use of Cantonese dialect words is
close to 50 percent (Li, et. al., 1995, p236).
Because of historical reasons, Hong Kong
Cantonese is linguistically more distant from
Mandarin than other regions in Mainland China.
One can easily spot Cantonese dialect articles in
Hong Kong newspapers which are totally
unintelligible to Mandarin speakers, while
Mandarin articles are easily understood by
Cantonese speakers. To translate a Cantonese
article into Mandarin, the primary task is to deal
with the Cantonese dialect words, especially
those that do not have semantically equivalent
counterparts in the target dialect. For example,
the Mandarin M(ju2, orange) has a much larger
coverage than the Cantonese tri (gwatl). In
addition to the Cantonese tra , the Mandarin Of
also includes the fruits Cantonese refers to as fft
(gam 1) and tl(caang2). On the other hand, the
Cantonese .15- semantically covers the
Mandarin t (go, walk) and IT (row).
Translation at the sound or pinyin level has to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989445">
1462
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930814814815">
deal with another kind of ambiguity: the
homophones of a word in the source dialect may
not have their counterpart synonyms in the target
dialect pronounced as homophones as well. For
example, the words (banana) and
(intersection) are both pronounced xiangljiaol
in Mandarin, but in Cantonese they are
pronounced hoenglziul and soenglgaaul
respectively, though their• written characters
remain unchanged.
To tackle these ambiguities, we employs the
techniques of hierarchical phrase analysis
(Zhang and Lu, 1997) and word collocation
processing (Sinclair, 1991), both rule-based and
corpus-based. Briefly speaking, the hierarchical
phrase analysis method firstly tries to solve a
word ambiguity in the context of the smallest
phrase containing the ambiguous word(s), then
the next layer of embedding phrase is used if
needed, and so on. As a result, the problem will
be solved within the minimally sufficient
context. To further facilitate the work, large
amount of commonly used phrases and phrase
schemes are being collected into the dictionary.
Further more, interaction between the users and
the MT system should be allowed for difficult
disambiguation (Martin, 1997a).

4 System Design and Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983364175">
A rudimentary design of a Cantonese-Mandarin
dialect MT system has been made, as shown in
Figure 1. The system takes Cantonese Pinyin
sentences as input and generates Mandarin
sentences in Hanyu Pinyin and in Chinese
characters. The translation is roughly done in
three steps: syntax conversion, word
disambiguation and source-target words
substitution. The knowledge bases include
linguistic rules, a word collocation list and a bi-
dialect MT dictionary.
A simplified example will make the basic
ideas clearer. Suppose the example word entries
and transformational rules in Section 2 are
included in the MT system&apos;s knowledge base.
Example sentence (2) in Cantonese, i.e.,
nei5 hang4 sinl
(2)
you go first
is given as input for the system to translate into
Mandarin. Because the input sentence contains
the time adverb &amp;quot;sianl&amp;quot; (first), according to
grammar rules, it is syntactically different from
its counterpart in Mandarin. According to the
flowchart, the Cantonese pinyin sentence is
converted into a Mandarin structure. Rule 1 in
the knowledge base is applied, producing
nei5 sinl hang4
45-
you first go
Then the dictionary is accessed. The Cantonese
word .1-T(hang4) corresponds to two Mandarin
words, i.e., (vi. go, walk) and 45* (n. row).
According to Rule 1, the verb Mandarin word is
selected. And the individual Cantonese words in
the sentence are substituted with their Mandarin
counterparts, a target Mandarin sentence
ni 3 xianl zou3
you first go
like sentence (1) is then correctly produced.

We are in the progress of implementing an inter-
dialect MT prototype, called CPC, for
translation between Cantonese and Putonghua
(i.e., Mandarin), both Cantonese-to-Putonghua
and Putonghua-to-Cantonese. Input and output
sentences are in pinyins or Chinese characters.
The programming languages used are Prolog
and Java. We are doing Cantonese-to-Putonghua
first, based on the design. At its current state, we
have built a Cantonese-Mandarin bi-dialect
dictionary of about 3000 words and phrases
based on some well established books (e.g.,
Zeng, 1984; Mai and Tang, 1997), (When
completed, there will be around 10,000 word
entries) and a handful of rules. A Cantonese-
Mandarin dialect corpus is also being built. The
program can process sentences of a number of
typical patterns. The funded project has two
immediate purposes: to facilitate language
communication and to help Hong Kong students
write standard Mandarin Chinese.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812590909091">
Compared with inter-language MT, inter-dialect
MT is much more manageable, both
linguistically and technically. Though generally
ignored, the development of inter-dialect MT
systems is both rewarding and more feasible.
The present paper discusses the design and
implementation of dialect MT systems at pinyin
and character levels, with special attention on
the Chinese Mandarin and Cantonese. When
supported by the modern technology for
multimedia communication of the Internet and
the WWW, dialect MT systems will produce
even greater benefits (Zhang and Lau, 1996).
Nonetheless, the research reported in this
paper can only be regarded as an initial
exploratory step into a new exciting research
area. There is large room for further research
and discussion, especially in word
disambiguation and syntax analysis. And we
should also notice that the grammars of ordinary
dialects are normally less well described than
those of lingua francas.

For example, the positions of some adverbs may vary from dialect to dialect. To express &amp;quot;You go first&amp;quot;, we have Mandarin: VI; 5 ni 3 xianl zou3 (1) you first go Cantonese: 41- nei5 hang4 sinl (2) you go first Comparative sentences represent another case where syntactic difference is likely to happen. For example the English sentence &amp;quot;A is taller than B&amp;quot; is expressed as Mandarin: A LL A bi3 B gaol (3) 2 In this paper, pronunciation of Mandarin is presented in Hanyu Pinyin Scheme (LICASS, 1996), and Cantonese in Yueyu Pinyin Scheme (LSHK, 1997). Numbers are used to denote tones of syllables. Yueyu Pinyin is based on Hanyu Pinyin. That means, across the two pinyin schemes, words with different pinyin symbols are normally pronounced differently. A than B tall Cantonese: A A A goul gwo3 B (4) A tall more B Sentences with double objects often follow different word orders, too. In a Mandarin sentence with two objects, the one referring to person(s) must be put before the other one. Yet, many dialects allow the order to be reversed, for example: Mandarin: 11C 5t wo3 xianl gei3 tal qian2 I first give him money I will give him some money fi</context>

We are in the progress of implementing an interdialect MT prototype, called CPC, for translation between Cantonese and Putonghua (i.e., Mandarin), both Cantonese-to-Putonghua and Putonghua-to-Cantonese. Input and output sentences are in pinyins or Chinese characters. The programming languages used are Prolog and Java. We are doing Cantonese-to-Putonghua first, based on the design. At its current state, we have built a Cantonese-Mandarin bi-dialect dictionary of about 3000 words and phrases based on some well established books (e.g., Zeng, 1984; Mai and Tang, 1997), (When completed, there will be around 10,000 word entries) and a handful of rules. A CantoneseMandarin dialect corpus is also being built. The program can process sentences of a number of typical patterns. The funded project has two immediate purposes: to facilitate language communication and to help Hong Kong students write standard Mandarin Chinese.

High quality machine translation between two languages requires deep understanding of the intended meaning of the source language sentences, which in turn involves disambiguation reasoning based on intelligent searches and proper uses of a great amount of relevant knowledge, including common sense (Nirenburg, et. al. 1992). The task is so demanding that some researchers are looking more seriously at machine-aided human translation as an alternative way to achieve automatic machine translation (Martin, 1997a, 1997b). Translation or interpretation is not necessarily an inter-language activity. In many cases, it happens among dialects within a single language. Similarly, MT can be inter-dialect as well. In fact, automatic translation or interpretation seems much more practical and achievable here since inter-dialect difference is much less serious than inter-language difference.

Inter-dialect differences exist in pronunciation, vocabulary and syntactic rules. However, they are usually insignificant in comparison with the similarities the dialects have. It has been declared that dialects of one language are mutually intelligible (Fromkin and Rodman 1993, p. 276). Nevertheless, this is not true to the situation in China. There are seven major Chinese dialects: the Northern Dialect (with Mandarin as its standard version), Cantonese, Wu, Min, Halcka, Xiang and Gan (Yuan, 1989), that for the most part are mutually unintelligible, and inter-dialect 1 In this paper, MT refers to both computer-based translation and interpretation. 1460 translation is often found indispensable for successful communication, especially between Cantonese, the most popular and the most influential dialect in South China and overseas, and Mandarin, the lingual franca of China. 2 Linguistic Consideration of Dialect MT Most differences among the dialects of a language are found in their sound inventory and phonological systems.
