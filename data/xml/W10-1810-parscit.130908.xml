<bodyText confidence="0.8854375625">
In this paper, we have addressed the task
of PropBank annotation of light verb
constructions, which like multi-word
expressions pose special problems. To
arrive at a solution, we have evaluated 3
different possible methods of annotation.
The final method involves three passes:
(1) manual identification of a light verb
construction, (2) annotation based on the
light verb construction&apos;s Frame File, and
(3) a deterministic merging of the first
two passes. We also discuss how in
various languages the light verb
constructions are identified and can be
distinguished from the non-light verb
word groupings.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998724947368421">
One of the aims in natural language processing,
specifically the task of semantic role labeling
(SRL), is to correctly identify and extract the
different semantic relationships between words
in a given text. In such tasks, verbs are
considered important, as they are responsible for
assigning and controlling the semantic roles of
the arguments and adjuncts around it. Thus, the
goal of the SRL task is to identify the arguments
of the predicate and label them according to their
semantic relationship to the predicate (Gildea
and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2003).
To this end, PropBank (Palmer et. al., 2005)
has developed semantic role labels and labeled
large corpora for training and testing of
supervised systems. PropBank identifies and
labels the semantic arguments of the verb on a
verb-by-verb basis, creating a separate Frame
File that includes verb specific semantic roles to
account for each subcategorization frame of the
verb. It has been shown that training supervised
systems with PropBank&apos;s semantic roles for
shallow semantic analysis yield good results (see
CoNLL 2005 and 2008).
However, semantic role labeling tasks are
often complicated by multiword expressions
(MWEs) such as idiomatic expressions (e.g.,
„Stop pulling my leg!&apos;), verb particle
constructions (e.g., „You must get over your
shyness.&apos;), light verb constructions (e.g., „take a
walk&apos;, „give a lecture&apos;), and other complex
predicates (e.g., V+V predicates such as Hindi&apos;s
fAwR 7rw nikal gayaa, lit. „exit went&apos;, means
„left&apos; or „departed&apos;). MWEs that involve verbs
are especially challenging because the
subcategorization frame of the predicate is no
longer solely dependent on the verb alone.
Rather, in many of these cases the argument
structure is assigned by the union of two
predicating elements. Thus, it is important that
the manual annotation of semantic roles, which
will be used by automatic SRL systems, define
and label these MWEs in a consistent and
effective manner.
In this paper we focus on the PropBank
annotation of light verb constructions (LVCs).
We have developed a multilingual schema for
annotating LVCs that takes into consideration the
similarities and differences shared by the
construction as it appears in English, Arabic,
Chinese, and Hindi. We also discuss in some
detail the practical challenges involved in the
crosslinguistic analysis of LVCs, which we hope
will bring us a step closer to a unified
crosslinguistic analysis.

PropBank, provides corresponding semantic role

labels for noun predicates (Meyers et al., 2004),
we would like to take advantage of NomBank&apos;s
existing nominalization Frame Files and
annotations as much as possible. A question that
we must therefore address is, “Are
nominalization argument structures exactly the
same whether or not they occur within an LVCT”
as will be discussed in section 6.1.

2 Identifying Light Verb Constructions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916142857143">
Linguistically LVCs are considered a type of a
complex predicate. Many studies from differing
angles and frameworks have characterized
complex predicates as a fusion of two or more
predicative elements. For example, Rosen (1997)
treats complex structures as complementation
structures, where the argument structure of
elements in a complex predicate are fused
together. Goldberg (1993) takes a constructional
approach to complex predicates and arrives at an
analysis that is comparable to viewing complex
predicates as a single lexical item. Similarly,
Mohanan (1997) assumes different levels of
linguistic representation for complex predicates
in which the elements, such as the noun and the
light verb, functionally combine to give a single
clausal nucleus. Alsina (1997) and Butt (1997)
suggest that complex predicates may be formed
by syntactically independent elements whose
argument structures are brought together by a
predicate composition mechanism.
While there is no clear-cut definition of LVCs,
let alone the whole range of complex predicates,
for the purposes of this study, we have adapted
our approach largely from Butt&apos;s (2004) criteria
for defining LVCs. LVCs are characterized by a
light verb and a predicating complement
(henceforth, true predicate) that “combine to
predicate as a single element.” (Ibid.) In LVC,
the verb is considered semantically bleached in
such a way that the verb does not hold its full
predicating power. Thus, the light verb plus its
true predicate can often be paraphrased by a
verbal form of the true predicate without loss of
the core meaning of the expression. For example,
the light verb `gave&apos; and the predicate `lecture&apos;
in `gave a lecture&apos;, together form a single
predicating unit such that it can be paraphrased
by `lectured&apos;.
True predicates in LVCs can be a noun (the
object of the verb or the object of the preposition
in a prepositional phrase), an adjective, or a verb.
One light verb plus true predicate combination
found commonly across all our PropBank
languages (i.e., English, Arabic, Chinese, and
Hindi) is the noun as the object of the verb as in
`Sara took [a stroll] along the beach&apos;. In Hindi,
true predicates can be adjectives or verbs, in
addition to the nouns.

3 Standard PropBank
Annotation Procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996767">
The PropBank annotation process can be broken
down into two major steps: creation of the Frame
Files for verbs occurring in the data and
annotation of the data using the Frame Files.
During the creation of the Frame Files, the
usages of the verbs in the data are examined by
linguists (henceforth, “framers”). Based on these
observations, the framers create a Frame File for
each verb containing one or more framesets,
which correspond to coarse-grained senses of the
predicate lemma. Each frameset specifies the
PropBank labels (i.e., ARG0, ARG1,...ARG5)
corresponding to the argument structure of the
verb. Additionally, illustrative examples are
included for each frameset, which will later be
referenced by the annotators. These examples
also include the use of the ARGM labels.
Thus, the framesets are based on the
examination of the data, the framers&apos; linguistic
knowledge and native-speaker intuition. At

times, we also make use of the syntactic and
semantic behavior of the verb as described by
certain lexical resources. These resources include
VerbNet (Kipper et. al., 2006) and FrameNet
(Baker et. al., 1998) for English, a number of
monolingual and bilingual dictionaries for
Arabic, and Hindi WordNet and DS Parses
(Palmer et. al., 2009) for Hindi. Additionally, if
available, we consult existing framesets of words
with similar meanings across different languages.
The data awaiting annotation are passed onto
the annotators for a double-blind annotation
process using the previously created framesets.
The double annotated data is then adjudicated by
a third annotator, during which time the
differences of the two annotations are resolved to
produce the Gold Standard.
Two major guiding considerations during the
framing and annotating process are data
consistency and annotator productivity. During
the frameset creation process, verbs that share
similar semantic and syntactic characteristics are
framed similarly. During the annotation process,
the data is organized by verbs so that each verb is
tackled all at once. In doing so, we firstly ensure
that the framesets of similar verbs, and in turn,
the annotation of the verbs, will both be
consistent across the data. Secondly, by tackling
annotation on verb-by-verb basis, the annotators
are able to concentrate on a single verb at a time,
making the process easier and faster for the
annotators.

4 Annotating LVC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99864566">
A similar process must be followed when
annotating light verb constructions The first step
is to create consistent Frame Files for light verbs.
Then in order to make the annotation process
produce consistent data at a reasonable speed, we
have decided to carry out the light verb
annotation in three passes (Table 1): (1) annotate
the light verb, (2) annotate the true predicate, and
(3) merge the two annotations into one.
The first pass involves the identification of the
light verb. The most important parts of this step
are to identify a verb as having bleached
meaning, thereafter assign a generic light verb
frameset and identify the true predicating
expression of the sentence, which would be
marked with ARG-PRX (i.e., ARGument-
PRedicating eXpression). For English, for
example, annotators were instructed to use Butt&apos;s
(2004) criteria as described in Section 2. These
criteria required that annotators be able to
recognize whether or not the complement of a
potential light verb was itself a predicating
element. To make this occasionally difficult
judgment, annotators used a simple heuristic test
of whether or not the complement was headed by
an element that has a verbal counterpart. If so,
the light verb frameset was selected.
The second pass involves the annotation of the
sentence with the true predicate as the relation.
During this pass, the true predicate is annotated
with an appropriate frameset. In the third pass,
the arguments and the modifiers of the two
previous passes are reconciled and merged into a
single annotation. In order to reduce the number
of hand annotation, it is preferable for this last
pass, the Pass 3, to be done automatically.
Since the nature of the light verb is different
from that of other verbs as described in Section
2, the advantage of doing the annotation of the
light verb and the true predicate on separate
passes is that in the light verb pass the annotators
will be able to quickly dispose of the verb as a
light verb and in the second pass, they will be
allowed to solely focus on the annotation of the
light verb&apos;s true predicate.
The descriptions of how the arguments and
modifiers of the light verbs and their true
predicates are annotated are mentioned in Table
1, but notably, none of the examples in it
currently include the annotation of arguments

and modifiers. This is intentional, as coming to
an agreement concerning the details of what
exactly each of the three passes looks like while
meeting the needs of the four PropBank
languages is quite challenging. Thus, for the rest
of the paper we will discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of the two trial methods of
annotation we have considered and discarded in
Section 5, as well as the final annotation scheme
we chose in Section 6.

5.1 Method 1

<bodyText confidence="0.851607761904762">
As our first attempt, the annotation of argument
and adjuncts was articulated in the following
manner (Table 2).

Revised information is in italics.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99943859375">
In Pass 1, in addition to annotating the
predicating expression of the light verb with
ARG-PRX, the subject argument was marked
with an ARG0. The choice of ARG0, which
corresponds to a proto-typical agent, was guided
by the observation that English LVCs tend to
lend a component of agentivity to the subject
even in cases where the true predicate would not
necessarily assign an agent as its subject. The
rest of the arguments and modifiers were labeled
with corresponding ARGM (i.e., modifier)
labels. The assumption here is that the arguments
of the light verb will also be the arguments of the
true predicate.
In Pass 2, then, the annotation of the
arguments of the true predicate was restricted to
its domain of locality (i.e., the span of the ARG-
PRX as marked in Pass1). That is, in the example
`John took a brisk walk through the park&apos;, the
labeled spans for the true predicate would be
limited to the NP `a brisk walk&apos; and neither
`John&apos; nor through the park&apos; would be annotated
as the arguments of the true predicate `walk&apos;.
Frame Files: This method would require three
Frame Files: a generic light verb Frame File, a
true predicate Frame File, and an LVC Frame
File. The Frame File for the light verb would not
be specific to the form of the light verb (e.g.,
same frame for take and make). Rather, it would
indicate a skeletal argument structure in order to
reduce the amount of Frame Files made,
including only Arg0 as its argument1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999817">
5.2 Weakness of Method 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999530769230769">
This method has one glaring problem: the
assumption that the semantic roles of the
arguments as assigned by the light verb
uniformly coincide with those assigned by the
true predicate does not always hold. Consider the
following English sentence2.
whether Wu Shu-Chen would make another
[appearance] in court was subject to observation
In this example, `Wu Shu-Chen&apos; is the agent
argument (Arg0) of the light verb `make&apos; and is
the theme or patient argument (Arg1) of a typical
`appearance&apos; event. Also consider the following
example from Hindi.
It is possible that in a light verb construction,
the light verb actually modifies the standard
underlying semantics of a nominalization like
appearance. In any event, we cannot assume that
the expected argument labels for the light verb
and for the standard interpretation of the
nominalization will always coincide. Thus, we
could say that Pass 2&apos;s true predicate annotation
is only partial and is not representative of the
complete argument structure. In particular, we
are left with a very difficult merging problem,
because the argument labels of the two separate
passes conflict as seen in the above examples.

argument and modifier labels. In Pass 2, the
limitation of annotating within the domain of
locality is removed. That is, the arguments and
modifiers inside and outside the true predicate&apos;s
domain of control are annotated with respect to
their semantic relationship to the true predicate
(e.g., in the English example of Section 5.2, `Wu
Shu-Chen&apos; would be considered ARG1 of
`appearance&apos;).
Frame Files: This method would also require
three Frame Files. The major difference is that
with this method the Frame File for the true
predicate includes arguments that are sisters to
the light verb.

5.4 Weaknesses of Method 2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.93533311627907">
If in Method 1 we have committed the error of
semantic unfaithfulness due to omission, in
Method 2 we are faced with the problem of
including too much. In the following sentence,
consider the role of the underlined adjunct:
A New York audience ... gave it a big round
of applause when the music started to play.
By the annotation in Method 2, the underlined
temporal adjunct `when the music started to
play&apos; is labeled as both the argument of `give&apos;
and of `applause&apos;. The question here is does the
argument apply to both the giving and the
applauding event? In other words, does the
adjunct play an equal role in both passes?
Since it could be easily said that the temporal
phrase applies to both the applauding and the
giving of the applause events, this example may
not be particularly compelling. However, what if
a syntactic complement of the light verb is a
semantic argument of the true predicate and the
true predicate only? This is seen more frequently
in the cases where the light verb is less bleached
than in the case of `give&apos; above. Consider the
following Arabic example.
زئاسخ نهدبكت ناكهإ انتازيضحت يف
took.we PREP DEF-consideration PREP
prepertations.our possibility sustain.their losses
`We took into [consideration] during our prepa-
rations the possibility of them sustaining losses&apos;
Here, even though the constituent `of them
sustaining losses&apos; is the syntactic complement of
the verb `to take;&apos; semantically, it modifies only
the nominal object of the PP `consideration.&apos;
There are similar phenomena in Chinese light
verb constructions. Syntactic modifiers of the
light verb are semantic arguments of the true
predicate, which is usually a nominalization that
serves as its complement.
我们 正 对 这 个 问题 [进行] 讨论 。
we now regarding this CL issue [conduct] discussion.
lit.“We are conducting a discussion on this issue.”
“We are discussing this issue.”
The prepositional phrase 对这个问题 `regarding
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.931834">
this issue&apos; is a sister to the light verb but
semantically it is an argument of the nominalized
predicate 讨论 `discussion&apos;.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999674">
The logical next question would be: does the
annotation of the arguments, adjuncts and
modifiers have to be all or nothing? It could
conceivably be possible to assign a selected set
of arguments at the light verb or true predicate
level. For example, in the Chinese sentence, the
modifier `regarding this CL issue&apos;, though a
syntactic adjunct to the light verb, could be left
out from the semantic annotation in Pass 1 and
included only in the Pass 2.
However, the objection to this treatment
comes from a more practical need. As mentioned
above, in order to keep the manual annotation to
a minimum, it would be necessary to keep Pass 3
completely deterministic. As is, with the
unmodified Method 2, there would be the need to
choose between Pass 1 or Pass 2 annotation to
when doing the automatic Pass 3. If we modify
Method 2 by annotating only a selected set of
syntactic arguments for the light verb or the true
predicate, then this issue is exacerbated. In such
a case there we would have to develop with strict
rules for which arguments of which pass should
be included in Pass 3. Pass 3 would no longer be
automatic, and should be done manually.

6.1 Semantic Fidelity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838">
Many of the objections so far to Methods 1 and 2
have centered on the issue of semantic fidelity
during the annotation of each of the two passes.
The debate of whether both passes should be
annotated and to what extent has practical
implications for the third Pass, as described
above. However, more importantly it comes
down to whether or not the semantics of the final
light verb plus true predicate combination is
indeed distinct from the semantics of its parts
(i.e. light verb and true predicate, separately).
This may be a fascinating linguistic question, but
it is not something our annotators can be
debating for each and every instance.
Instead, we argue that the semantic argument
structure of the light verb plus true predicate
combination can in practice be different from
that of the expressions taken independently as
has been proposed by various studies (Butt,
2004; Rosen, 1997; Grimshaw &amp; Mester, 1988).
Thus, we resolve the cases in which the
differences in argument roles as assigned by the
light verb and the nominalization (Section 5.2)
by handling the argument structure of the
standard nominalization separately from that of
the nominalization participating in the LVC. In
the example `Chen made another appearance in
court&apos;, we annotate `Chen&apos; as the Agent (ARG0)
of the full predicate `[make] [appearance]&apos;,
which is different from the argument structure of
the standard nominalization which would label
`Chen&apos; to be the Patient argument (ARG1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999501">
6.2 Method 3: Final Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99099625">
Our final method of light verb annotation reflects
the notion that the noun, verb, or adjective as a
true predicate within an LVC can have a
different argument structure from that of the
word alone. Table 4 shows the final annotation
scheme for light verb construction.
During Pass 1, the LVCs and their predicating
expressions are identified in the data. Instances
identified as LVCs in Pass 1 are then manually
annotated during Pass 2, annotating the
arguments and adjuncts of the light verb and the
true predicate with roles that reflect their
semantic relationships to the light verb plus true
predicate. In practice, Pass 1 becomes a way of
simply manually identifying the light verb
usages. It is in Pass 2 that we make the final
choice of argument labels for all of the
arguments. Thus in Pass 3, the light verb and the
true predicate lemmas from Pass 1 and 2 are
joined into a single unit (e.g., in the example
found in Table 4, the light verb `took&apos; would be
joined with the true predicate `walk&apos; into
`took+walk’) 3. In this final method, Pass 3 can
be achieved completely deterministically.
The major difference in this annotation
scheme from that of Methods 1 and 2 is that
instead of annotating in terms of the semantics of
the bare noun, adjective or verb, the argument
structure is determined for the entire predicate or
the full event: semantics of the light verb plus the
true predicate. This means that for the sentences
where the argument roles of the verb and the
nominalization disagree like `Chen&apos; in `Chen
3 The order of Pass 2 and Pass 3 as presented in Table 4 is
arguably a product of how the annotation tools for
PropBank are set up for Arabic, Chinese, and English. That
is, the order of the Pass 2 and Pass 3 could potentially be
flipped provided that the tools and procedures of annotation
support it, as is the case for Hindi PropBank. After the LVC
and ARG-PRX are identified in Pass 1, the light verb and
the true predicate can be deterministically joined into a
single relation in Pass 2, leaving the manual annotation of
LVC for Pass 3. The advantage of this alternative ordering
is that because the annotation of LVC is done around light
verb plus the true predicate as a single relation, rather than
the true predicate alone as in Table 4, the argument
annotation may in actuality be more intuitive for annotators
even with less training.

made another4 appearance in court&apos;, we label the
argument with the role that is consistent with the
entire predicate (i.e. Agent, ARG0).
Frame Files: The final advantage to this
method is that only one Frame File is needed.
Since Pass 1 is an identification round, no Frame
File is required. A single Frame File for LVC
that includes the argument structure with respect
to the light verb plus true predicate combination
will suffice for Pass 2 and Pass 3.

7 Distinguishing LVCs from MWEs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956605263158">
As we have discussed in Section 2, we adapted
our approach from Butt&apos;s (2004) definition of
LVCs. That is, an LVC is characterized by a
semantically bleached light verb and a true
predicate. These elements combine as a single
predicating unit, in such a way that the light verb
plus its true predicate can be paraphrased by a
verbal form of the true predicate without loss of
the core meaning of the expression (e.g.
`lectured&apos; for `gave a lecture&apos;). Also, as
discussed in Section 6.1, our approach advocates
the notion that the semantic argument structure
of the light verb plus true predicate is different
from that of the expressions taken independently
(as also proposed by Butt, 2004; Rosen, 1997;
Grimshaw &amp; Mester, 1988 among others).
While these definitions are appropriate for the
PropBank annotation task as we have presented
it, there are still cases that merit closer attention.
Even English with a rather limited set of verbs
that are commonly cited as LVCs, includes a
problematic mixture of what could arguably be
termed either LVCs or idiomatic expressions:
`make exception&apos;, `take charge&apos;. This difficulty
in part is the effect of frequency and
entrenchment of particular constructions. The
light verbs themselves do not diminish in form
over time in a manner similar to auxiliaries (Butt,
2004), although the complements of common
LVCs can change over time such that it is no
longer clear that the complement is a predicating
element.
In the case of English, the expressions `take
charge&apos; may be more commonly found today as a
LVC than independently in its verbal form. As
we discovered with our annotators, native
English speakers are uncomfortable using the
verb `charge&apos; (i.e. to burden with a

responsibility) as an independent matrix verb. A
similar phenomenon can be seen in Arabic,
where the predicate نسا قلطأ lit. `release name&apos;
exemplifies a prototypical LVC that means `to
name&apos;. However, in our data we see cases in
which the complement is missing, while the
semantics of the LVC remains intact:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.670604">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.970050456521739">
CONJ REL be released.he PREP-him/it
DEF-sector DEF-public
lit `Or what is released to it “the public sector”&apos;
`Or what is called/named “the public sector.”&apos;
This raises the question of: when does a
construction that may have once been an LVC
become more properly defined as an idiomatic
expression due to such entrenchment? Idiomatic
expressions can potentially be distinguished from
LVCs through judgments of how fixed or
syntactically variable a construction is, and on
the basis of how semantically transparent or
decomposable the construction is (Nunberg et.
al., 1994). However, sometimes the dividing line
is hard to draw.
A similar problem arises in determining
whether a construction is a case of an LVC or
simply a usage with a distinct sense of the verb.
Take, for example, the following Arabic
sentence.
ءاذغلا لوانت
take.he DEF-food
lit. `(he) took food&apos;
`he ate&apos;
Here, the Arabic word ءاذغ `food&apos; is the noun
derivation of the root shared by the verb ىذغت `to
eat&apos;, in such a way that the sentence could be
rephrased as ىذغت `(he) ate&apos;. This example falls
neatly into the LVC category. However, further
examples suggest that the example is a case of a
distinct sense of `to take orally&apos; where the
restrictions on the object are that the theme must
be something that can be taken by mouth:
ءاودلا لوانت ءاسحلا لوانت
take.he DEF-medicine take.he DEF-soup
`he took medicine&apos; `he took soup&apos;
Finally, determining the appropriate criteria to
distinguish between a truly semantically
bleached verb and verbs that seem to be
participating in complex predication but
contribute more to the semantics of the
construction is a challenge for all languages. For
example, in English data, there are potential
LVCs with verbs that are not often thought of as
light verbs, such as `produce an alteration&apos; and
&amp;quot; ماعلا عاطقلا &amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995091">
88
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999350340909091">
`issue a complaint&apos;. Although most English
speakers would agree that the verbs in these
constructions do not contribute to the semantics
of the construction (e.g. `issue a complaint&apos; can
be paraphrased to `to complain&apos;), there are
similar constructions such as `register a
complaint,&apos; wherein the verb cannot be
considered light. For the purposes of annotation,
where it is necessary for annotators to understand
clear criteria for distinguishing light verbs, such
cases are highly problematic because there is no
deterministic way to measure the extent to which
the verbal element contributes to the semantics
of the construction. In turn, there is not a good
way to distinguish some of these borderline
verbs from their normal, heavy usages.
Such problems can be resolved by establishing
language-specific semantic or syntactic tests that
can be used for taking care of the borderline
cases of LVCs. However, there is one other
plausible manner we have identified that could
help in detecting such atypical LVCs. This can
be done by focusing on the argument structures
of predicating complements rather than focusing
on the verbs themselves. Grimshaw &amp; Mester
(1988) suggest that the formation of LVCs
involves argument transfer from the predicating
complement to the verb, which is semantically
bleached and thematically incomplete and
assigns no thematic roles itself. Similarly,
Stevenson et al. (2004) suggest that the
acceptability of a potential LVC depends on the
semantic properties of the complement. Thus,
atypical LVCs, such as the English construction
`issue a complaint,&apos; can potentially be detected
during the annotation of eventive nouns, planned
for all PropBank languages.
This process will make our treatment of LVCs
more comprehensive. Used with our language-
specific semantic and syntactic criteria relating to
both the verb and the predicating complement, it
will help us to more effectively capture as many
types of LVCs as possible, including those of the
V+ADJ and V+V varieties.

8 Usefulness of our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983040816327">
Two basic approaches have previously been
taken to handle all types of MWEs, including
LVCs in natural language processing
applications. The first is to treat MWEs quite
simply as fixed expressions or long strings of
words with spaces in between; the second is to
treat MWEs as purely compositional (Sag et al.,
2002). The words-with-spaces approach is
adequate for handling fixed idiomatic
expressions, but issues of lexical proliferation
and flexibility quickly arise when this approach
is applied to light verbs, which are syntactically
flexible and can number in the tens of thousands
for a given language (Stevenson et al., 2004; Sag
et al., 2002). Nonetheless, large-scale lexical
resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998)
and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1999) continue to
expand with entries that are MWEs.
The purely compositional approach is also
problematic for light verbs because it is
notoriously difficult to predict which light verbs
can grammatically combine with other
predicating elements; thus, this approach leads to
problems of overgeneration (Sag et al., 2002). In
order to overcome this problem, Stevenson et al.
(2004) attempted to determine which
nominalizations could form a valid complement
to the English light verbs take, give and make,
using Levin&apos;s (1993) verb classes to group
similar nominalizations. This approach was
rather successful for take and give, but
inconclusive for the verb make.
Our approach can help to develop a resource
that is useful whether one takes a words-with-
spaces approach or a compositional approach.
Specifically, for those implementing a words-
with-spaces approach, the resulting PropBank
annotation can serve as a lexical resource listing
for LVCs. For those interested in implementing a
compositional approach the PropBank annotation
can serve to assist in predicting likely
combinations. Moreover, information in the
PropBank Frame Files can be used to generalize
across classes of nouns that can occur with a
given light verb with the help of lexical resources
such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet
(Baker et. al., 1998), and VerbNet (Kipper-
Schuler, 2005) (in a manner similar to the
approach of Stevenson et al. (2004)).

Thus, we resolve the cases in which the differences in argument roles as assigned by the light verb and the nominalization (Section 5.2) by handling the argument structure of the standard nominalization separately from that of the nominalization participating in the LVC. In the example `Chen made another appearance in court&apos;, we annotate `Chen&apos; as the Agent (ARG0) of the full predicate `[make] [appearance]&apos;, which is different from the argument structure of the standard nominalization which would label `Chen&apos; to be the Patient argument (ARG1). 6.2 Method 3: Final Method Our final method of l</context>

These elements combine as a single predicating unit, in such a way that the light verb plus its true predicate can be paraphrased by a verbal form of the true predicate without loss of the core meaning of the expression (e.g. `lectured&apos; for `gave a lecture&apos;). Also, as discussed in Section 6.1, our approach advocates the notion that the semantic argument structure of the light verb plus true predicate is different from that of the expressions taken independently (as also proposed by Butt, 2004; Rosen, 1997; Grimshaw &amp; Mester, 1988 among others). While these definitions are appropriate for the PropBank annotation task as we have presented it, there are still cases that merit closer attention. Even English with a rather limited set of verbs that are commonly cited as LVCs, includes a problematic mixture of what could arguably be termed either LVCs or idiomatic expressions: `make exception&apos;, `take charge&apos;.

In turn, there is not a good way to distinguish some of these borderline verbs from their normal, heavy usages. Such problems can be resolved by establishing language-specific semantic or syntactic tests that can be used for taking care of the borderline cases of LVCs. However, there is one other plausible manner we have identified that could help in detecting such atypical LVCs. This can be done by focusing on the argument structures of predicating complements rather than focusing on the verbs themselves. Grimshaw &amp; Mester (1988) suggest that the formation of LVCs involves argument transfer from the predicating complement to the verb, which is semantically bleached and thematically incomplete and assigns no thematic roles itself. Similarly, Stevenson et al. (2004) suggest that the acceptability of a potential LVC depends on the semantic properties of the complement. Thus, atypical LVCs, such as the English construction `issue a complaint,&apos; can potentially be detected during the annotation of eventive nouns, planned for all PropBank languages. This process will make our treatment of LVCs more comprehensive. Used with o</context>

In such tasks, verbs are considered important, as they are responsible for assigning and controlling the semantic roles of the arguments and adjuncts around it. Thus, the goal of the SRL task is to identify the arguments of the predicate and label them according to their semantic relationship to the predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2003). To this end, PropBank (Palmer et. al., 2005) has developed semantic role labels and labeled large corpora for training and testing of supervised systems. PropBank identifies and labels the semantic arguments of the verb on a verb-by-verb basis, creating a separate Frame File that includes verb specific semantic roles to account for each subcategorization frame of the verb. It has been shown that training supervised systems with PropBank&apos;s semantic roles for shallow semantic analysis yield good results (see CoNLL 2005 and 2008). However, semantic role labeling tasks are</context>
