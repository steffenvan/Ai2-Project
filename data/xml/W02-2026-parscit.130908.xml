process of intra-family translation was handled by
weighted string distance models of cognate similarity
with a probabilistic representation of common intra-
family orthographic transformations. These models
were iteratively reestimated using an Expectation-
Maximization algorithm (Ristad and Yanilos 1997).
When intra-family orthographic shifts are clear and
systematic, such models can be quite effective on
their own. In practice, the technique described
suffers from the problem of faux amis — false cog-
nates. For example, Serbian-Czech faux amis such
as prazan-prizen and prazan-pazen can outrank the
correct but orthographically less similar prazan-
prazdny, causing the English bridge pathways to the
correct English translations blank and empty to be
scored below the incorrect translation paths to favor,
grace and patronage.
This paper addresses the above-described model
deficiency by proposing, developing and evaluating
the use of 7 additional similarity models which suc-
cessfully capture a set of complementary distribu-
tional behaviors. An algorithm combining them
with weighted string distance significantly outper-
forms the previous bridge language approach on
both English-Serbian and English-Gujarati test sets.

Our goal was to learn translation lexicons using
resources that are available on the internet at no
monetary cost. No seed dictionary is required be-
tween English and the language of interest; a size-
able dictionary between the bridge language and En-
glish is necessary. Our work with Serbian involved
the use of a Czech-English dictionary initially con-
taining roughly 171K Czech-English pairs, including
54K unique Czech word types and 43K unique En-
glish types. The Hindi-English dictionary contained
around 74K pairs. The Serbian/Gujarati vocabular-
ies we used were built by extracting all word types
from the respective corpora, then filtering out low-
frequency words (since our similarity models require
reliable corpus statistics) and very short words&apos; (use
of string distance to propose cognate candidates for
very short words was seen to be unreliable in pre-
liminary experiments). The corpora used here are
composed of news data, the majority of which was
downloaded from the internet. The English cor-
pus contains 192M tokens; Serbian, 12M; Gujarati,
2M. English was lemmatized using a high-quality
lemmatization utility; the Serbian, using minimally
supervised morphological analysis as described in
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000). Gujarati was
not lemmatized. Where possible, date labels were
extracted for news stories. This resulted in 1690
separate labeled days of news for Serbian and 233
for Gujarati. For each language task, English news
data was marked as originating either locally or non-

spoken, in order to facilitate computation of date-
distributional similarities across both strongly re-
lated, same-region news sources (date-local) and a
general, worldwide aggregate news corpus (date-all).

3 Translation Similarity Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789666666667">
The algorithm presented here is based on the novel
combination of the following 4 categories of similar-
ity models: string similarity, context similarity, date
distributional similarity, and similarity of word fre-
quency and burstiness statistics. Three of these 4
categories are further broken down into individual
similarity measures for a total of 8: weighted Lev-
enshtein (string), wide and narrow context, world-
news and local-news-based date similarities, and rel-
ative frequency, burstiness, and inverse document
frequency (IDF) similarities. The algorithm used
for rank-based combination of the individual models
is given in Section 4.
The initial set of candidate translation pairs
is generated (as in Figure 2) by considering
all source-language words within a low, initially-
weighted string distance to entries in the given
bridge-language-to-English dictionary. The result-
ing source-language-to-English candidate pairs are
then filtered and ranked by the similarity measures
described below:

<bodyText confidence="0.986902944444444">
On the first iteration, Levenshtein string edit dis-
tance uses a simple language-independent matrix
that assigns dist(Vowel ± ,Vowel ±) and other vowel
cluster operations one half the cost of equivalent sin-
gle consonant substitutions, insertions and deletions.
At the beginning of the 2nd model iteration, the
character-distance matrix is reestimated as in Mann
and Yarowsky (2001) using the high-confidence out-
put from the 1st iteration as training data. For each
of the top 2000 Serbian-English proposed translation
pairs after the 1st iteration, the Serbian word and
the Czech bridge words having lowest string distance
to it (there might have been multiple possible Czech
bridges at several distances) are used as a pair into
the training set for learning of edit weights.

graphic substitutions that are discovered by this pro-
cess are:

candidates underperform individual non-string similarity measures, and they consistently underperform the weighted combi-
nation of all 8 similarity measures. Note that in the case of nezavisnost, the correct translation independence is successfully
ranked above its quite closely related competitor freedom by almost every non-string-based similarity measure in isolation. This
behavior (shown quantatively in Figure 8) illustrates the contribution of consensus modeling over this set of diverse similarity
measures.

The resulting source-language-to-English candidate pairs are then filtered and ranked by the similarity measures described below: 3.1 Weighted Levenshtein. Similarity On the first iteration, Levenshtein string edit distance uses a simple language-independent matrix that assigns dist(Vowel ± ,Vowel ±) and other vowel cluster operations one half the cost of equivalent single consonant substitutions, insertions and deletions. At the beginning of the 2nd model iteration, the character-distance matrix is reestimated as in Mann and Yarowsky (2001) using the high-confidence output from the 1st iteration as training data. For each of the top 2000 Serbian-English proposed translation pairs after the 1st iteration, the Serbian word and the Czech bridge words having lowest string distance to it (there might have been multiple possible Czech bridges at several distances) are used as a pair into the training set for learning of edit weights. Some high probability Serbian-Czech orthographic substitutions that are discovered by this process are: Serbian Czech logprob a e -4.6 i Y -5.8 s c -7.2 n 1 -7.5 s z -7.7 k c -7.7 3.2 Context Similarity W</context>
