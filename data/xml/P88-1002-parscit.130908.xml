This paper describes an analysis of telegraphic
fragments as regular structures (not errors) han-
dled by minimal extensions to a system designed
for processing the standard language. The modu-
lar approach which has been implemented in the
Unisys natural language processing system PUNDIT

1. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we discuss the syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic analysis of fragmentary
sentences in English. Our central claim is that
these sentences, which have often been classified
in the literature with truly erroneous input such
as misspellings (see, for example, the work dis-
cussed in [Kwasny1980, Thompson1980,
Kwasny1981, Sondheimer1983, Eastman1981, Jen-
sen1983]), are regular structures which can be
processed by adding a small number of rules to
the grammar and other components of the sys-
tem. The syntactic regularity of fragment struc-
tures has been demonstrated elsewhere, notably
in [Marsh1983, Hirschman1983]; we will focus here
upon the regularity of these structures across all
levels of linguistic representation. Because the
syntactic component regularises these structures
into a form almost indistinguishable from full

assertions, the semantic and pragmatic com-
ponents are able to interpret them with few or no
extensions to existing mechanisms. This process
of incremental regularisation of fragment struc-
tures is possible only within a linguistically modu-
lar system. Furthermore, we claim that although
fragments may occur more frequently in special-
ised sublanguages than in the standard grammar,
they do not provide evidence that sublanguages
are based on grammatical principles fundamen-
tally different from those underlying standard
languages, as claimed by (Fitspatrick1988], for
example.
This paper is divided into five sections. The
introductory section defines fragments and
describes the scope of our work. In the second
section, we consider certain properties of sentence
fragments which motivate a modular approach.
The third section describes our implementation of
processing for fragments, to which each com-
ponent of the system makes a distinct contribu-
tion. The fourth section describes the temporal
analysis of fragments. Finally, the fifth section
discusses the status of sublanguages characterised
by these telegraphic constructions.
We define fragments as regular structures
which are distinguished from full assertions by a
missing element or elements which are normally
syntactically obligatory. We distinguish them
from errors on the basis of their regularity and
consistency of interpretation, and because they
appear to be generated intentionally. We are not
denying the existence of true errors, nor that pro-
cessing sentences containing true errors may
require sophisticated techniques and deep reason-
ing. Rather, we are saying that fragments are dis-
tinct from errors, and can be handled in a quite
general fashion, with minimal extensions to nor-
mal processing. Because we base the definition of
fragment on the absence of a syntactically

obligatory element, noun phrases without articles
are not considered to be fragmentary, since this
omission is conditioned heavily by semantic fac-
tors such as the mass vs. count distinction. How-
ever, we have implemented a pragmatically based
treatment of noun phrases without determiners,
which is briefly discussed in Section 3.
Fragments, then, are defined here as eli-
sions. We describe below the way in which these
omissions are detected and subsequently &apos;filled in&apos;
by different modules of the system.
The problem of processing fragmentary sen-
tences has arisen in the context of a large-scale
natural language processing research project con-
ducted at UNISYS over the past five years [Pal-
mer1988, Hirschman1988, Dowding1987,
Dah11987]. We have developed a portable,
broad-coverage text-processing system, PUNDIT.1
Our initial applications have involved various
message types, including: field engineering reports
for maintenance of computers; Navy maintenance
reports (Casualty Reports, or CASREPs) for start-
ing air compressors; Navy intelligence reports
(11AINFORms); trouble and failure reports (TFR8)
from Navy Vessels; and recently we have exam-
ined several medical domains (radiology reports,
comments fields from a DNA sequence database).
At least half the sentences in these corpora are
fragments; Table 1 below gives a summary of the
fragment content of three domains, showing the
percent of centers which are classified as frag-
ments. (Centers comprise all sentence types:
assertions, questions, fragments, and so forth.)

The PUNDIT system is highly modular: it
consists of a syntactic component, based on string
grammar and restriction grammar [Sager1981,
Hirschman1985]; a semantic component, based on
inference-driven mapping, which decomposes
predicating expressions into predicates and
thematic roles [Palmer1983, Palmer1985]; and a
pragmatics component which processes both refer-
ring expressions [Dah11988], and temporal expres-
sions [Passonnesul987, Passonneau19881.

2. DIVISION OF LABOR AMONG SYN-
TAX, SEMANTICS, AND PRAGMATICS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996758">
We argue here that sentence fragments pro-
vide a strong case for linguistically modular sys-
tems such as PUNDIT, because such elisions have
distinct consequences at different levels of linguis-
tic description. Our approach to fragments can be
summarised by saying that syntax detects &apos;holes&apos;
in surface structure and creates dummy elements
as placeholders for the missing elements; seman-
tics and pragmatics interpret these placeholders
at the appropriate point in sentence processing,
utilising the same mechanisms for fragments as
for full assertions.
Syntax regulates the holes. Fragment
elisions cannot be accounted for in purely
semantic/pragmatic terms. This is evidenced by
the fact that there are syntactic restrictions on
omissions; the acceptability of a sentence frag-
ment hinges on grammatical factors rather than,
e.g., how readily the elided material can be
inferred from context. For example, the discourse
Old house too small. Â°New one will be larger than
_ was (where the elided object of than is under-
stood to be old house) is ill-formed, whereas a
comparable discourse First repairman ordered new
air conditioner. Second repairman will install _
(where the elided object of install is understood to
be air conditioner) is acceptable. In both cases
above, the referent of the elided element is avail-
able from context, and yet only the second ellipsis
sounds well-formed. Thus an appreciation of
where such ellipses may occur is part of the
linguistic knowledge of speakers of English and
not simply a function of the contextual salience
of elided elements. Since these restrictions con-
cern structure rather than content, they would be
difficult or impossible to state in a system such as
a &apos;pure&apos; semantic grammar which only recognised
such omissions at the level of semantic/pragmatic
representation.
Furthermore, it matters to semantics and
pragmatics HOW an argument is omitted. The
syntactic component must tell semantics whether
a verb argument is missing because the verb is
used intransitively (as in The tiger was eating,
where the patient argument is not specified) or
because of a fragment ellipsis (as in Eaten by a
tiger, where the patient argument is missing
because the subject of a passive sentence has
been elided). Only in the latter case does the
missing argument of eat function as an
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999432346153846">
antecedent subsequently in the discourse: compare
Eaten by a tiger. Had screamed bloody murder
right before the attack (where the victim and the
screamer are the same) vs. The tiger was eating.
Had screamed bloody murder right before the
attack (where it is difficult or impossible to get the
reading in which the victim and the screamer are
the same).
Semantics and pragmatics fill the holes.
In PUNDIT&apos;a treatment of fragments, each com-
ponent contributes exactly what is appropriate to
the specification of elided elements. Thus the syn-
tax does not attempt to &apos;fill in&apos; the holes that it
discovers, unless that information is completely
predictable given the structure at hand. Instead,
it creates a dummy element. If the missing ele-
ment is an elided subject, then the dummy ele-
ment created by the syntactic component is
assigned a referent by the pragmatics component.
This referent is then assigned a thematic role by
the semantics component like any other referent,
and is subject to any selectional restrictions asso-
ciated with the thematic role assigned to it. If
the missing element is a verb, it is specified in
either the syntactic or the semantic component,
depending upon the fragment type.

Z. PROCESSING FRAGMENTS IN PUN-
DIT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974050000001">
Although the initial PUNDIT system was
designed to handle full, as opposed to fragmen-
tary, sentences, one of the interesting results of
our work is that it has required only very minor
changes to the system to handle the basic frag-
ment types introduced below. These included the
additions of: 6 fragment BNF definitions to the
grammar (a 5% increase in grammar size) and 7
context-sensitive restrictions (a 12% increase in
the number of restrictions); one semantic rule for
the interpretation of the dummy element inserted
for missing verbs; a minor modification to the
reference resolution mechanism to treat elided
noun phrases like pronouns; and a small addition
to the temporal processing mechanism to handle
tenseless fragments. The small number of
changes to the semantic and pragmatic com-
ponents reflects the fact that these components
are not &apos;aware&apos; that they are interpreting frag-
mentary structures, because the regularisation
performed by the syntactic component renders
them structurally indistinguishable from full
assertions.
Fragments present parsing problems because
the ellipsis creates degenerate structures. For
example, a sequence such as chest negative can
be analysed as a &apos;sero-copula&apos; fragment meaning
the chest X-ray is negative, or a noun compound
like the negative of the chest. This is compounded
by the lack of derivational and inflectional mor-
phology in English, so that in many cases it may
not be possible to distinguish a noun from a verb
(repair parts) or a past tense from a past partici-
ple (decreased medication). Adding fragment
definitions to the grammar (especially if deter-
miner omission is also allowed) results in an
explosion of ambiguity. This problem has been
noted and discussed by Kwasny and Sondheimer
[Kwasny1981]. Their solution to the problem is
to suggest special relaxation techniques for the
analysis of fragments. However, in keeping with
our thesis that fragments are normal construc-
tions, we have chosen the alternative of con-
straining the explosion of parses in two ways.
The first is the addition of a control structure to
implement a limited form of preference via
&apos;unbacktrackable&apos; or (xor). This binary operator
tries its second argument only if its first argu-
ment does not lead to a parse. In the grammar,
this is used to prefer &amp;quot;the most structured&amp;quot; alter-
native. That is, full assertions are preferred over
fragments â if an assertion or other non-fragment
parse is obtained, the parser does not try for a
fragment parse.
The second mechanism that helps to control
generation of incorrect parses is selection. PUNDIT
applies surface selectional constraints incremen-
tally, as the parse is built up [Lang1988]. For
example, the phrase air compressor would NOT be
allowed as a serocopula because the construction

The fragment types currently treated in
PUNDIT include the following:
Zerocopula: a subject followed by a predicate,
differing from a full clause only in the absence of
a verb, as in impellor blade tip erosion eviden4
Tvo (tensed verb + object): a sentence missing its
subject, as in Believe the coupling from diesel to
sac lube oil pump to be sheared;

per would fail selection (sentences don&apos;t fragment structures),
permitting the serocopula fragment parse.

The processing of these basic fragment
types can be summarised briefly as follows: a
detailed surface pane tree is provided which
represents the overt lexical content in its surface
order. At this level, fragments bear very little
resemblance to full assertions. But at the level of
the Intermediate Syntactic Representation (ISR),
3 It is interesting to note that at least some of these
types of fragments resemble non-fragmentary structures in
other languages. tvo fragments, for example, can be com-
pared to sero-subject sentences in Japanese, serocopulas
resemble copular sentences in Arabic and Russian, and struc-
tures similar to predicate can be found in Cantonese (our
thanks to K. Fu for the Cantonese data). This being the cue,
it is not surprising that analogous sentences in English can be
processed without resorting to extragrammatical mechanisms.

which is a regularised representation of syntactic
structure Pah11987.1, fragments are regularised
to parallel full assertions by the use of dummy
elements standing in for the missing subject or
verb. The CONTENT of these dummy elements,
however, is left unspecified in most cases, to be
filled in by the semantic or pragmatic components
of the system.
Tvo. We consider first the tvo, a subject-
less tensed clause such as Operates normally. This
is parsed as a sequence of tensed verb and object:
no subject is inferred at the level of surface struc-
ture. In the UR, the missing subject is filled in by
the dummy element elided. At the level of the
ISR, then, the fragment operates normally differs
from a full assertion such as It operates normally
only by virtue of the element elided in place of
an overt pronoun. The element elided is assigned
a referent which subsequently fills a thematic
role, exactly as if it were a pronoun; thus these
two sentences get the same treatment from
semantics and reference resolution[Dah11988, Pal-
mer1986].
Elided subjects in the domains we have
looked at often refer to the writer of the report,
so one strategy for interpreting them might be
simply to assume that the filler of the elided sub-
ject is the writer of the report. This simple stra-
tegy is not sufficient in all cases. For example, in
the CASREPS corpus we observe sequences such
as the following, where the filler of the elided sub-
ject is provided by the previous sentence, and is
clearly not the writer of the report.

point approximately seven minutes after
engagement. Believed due to worn bushings.
Thus, it is necessary to be able to treat elided
subjects as pronouns in order to handle these sen-
tences.
The effect of an elided subject on subse-
quent focusing is the same as that of an overt
pronoun. We demonstrated in section 2 that
elided subjects, but not semantically implicit
arguments, are expected foci (or forward-looking
centers [Gross19881) for later sentences.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992877">

<bodyText confidence="0.99979141025641">
The basic assumption underlying this treat-
ment is that the pragmatic analysis for elided
subjects should be as similar to that of pronouns
as possible. One piece of supporting evidence for
this assumption is that in many languages, such
as Japanese [Gunde11980, H1nds1983,
Kameyama1985] the functional equivalent of
unstressed pronouns in English is a zero, or elided
noun phrase.5 If zeros in other languages can
correspond to unstressed pronouns in English,
then we hypothesise that zeros in a sublanguage
of English can correspond functionally to pro-
nouns in standard English. In addition, since pro-
cessing of pronouns is independently motivated, it
is a priori simpler to try to fit elision into the pro-
nominal paradigm, if possible, than to create an
entirely separate component for handling elision.
Under this hypothesis, then, tvo fragments
represent simply a realisation of a grammatical
strategy that is generally available to languages
of the world. 8
Zerocopula. For a serocopula (e.g., Disk
bad), the surface parse tree rather than the ISR
inserts a dummy verb, in order to enforce sub-
categorisation constraints on the object. And in
the mit, this null verb is &apos;filled in&apos; as the verb be.
It is possible to fill in the verb at this level
because no further semantic or pragmatic infor-
mation is required in order to determine its con-
tent? Hence the representation for Disk bad is
nearly indistinguishable from that assigned to the
corresponding Disk is bad; the only difference is in
the absence of tense from the former. If the null
verb represents auxiliary be, then, like an overt
auxiliary, it does not appear in the regularised
form. Sac failing thus receives a regularisation
with fail as the main verb. Thus the null verb
inserted in the syntax is treated in the Int in a
fashion exactly parallel to the treatment of overt
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.477043142857143">
6 Stressed pronouns in English correspond to overt pro-
nouns in languages like Japanese, as discussed in [Gun-
de11980, Gunde119811, and IDah119821.
6 An interesting hypothesis, discussed by Gundel and
Kameyama, is that the more topic prominent a language is,
the more likely it is to have sero-NP&apos;s. Perhaps the fact that
sublanguage messages are characterised by rigid, contextually
supplied, topics contributes to the availability of the tvo
fragment type in English.
7 In some restricted subdomsins, however, other verbs
may be omitted: for example, in certain radiolov reports an
omitted verb may be interpreted as slow rather than be.

occurrences of be.
Nstg_frag. The syntactic parse tree for
this fragment type contains no empty elements; it
is a regular noun phrase, labeled as an
nstg_frag. The ISR transforms it into a vso
sequence. This is done by treating it as the sub-
ject of an element empty_verb; in the semantic
component, the subject of empty_verb is treated
as the sole argument of a predicate
existential(X). As a result, the nstg_frag
Failure of sae and a synonymous assertion such as
Failure of sac occurred are eventually mapped
onto similar final representations by virtue of the
temporal semantics of empty_verb and of the
head of the noun phrase.
Objbe_frag and predicate. These are iso-
lated complements; the same devices described
above are utilised in their processing. The sur-
face parse tree of these fragment types contains
no empty elements; as with serocopula, the
untensed verb be is inserted into the IsEt; as with
tvo, the dummy subject elided is also inserted in
the MR, to be filled in by reference resolution.
Thus the simple adjective Inoperative will receive
an ISR quite similar to that of He/she/it is ino-
perative.
Obj...gap_fragment. The final fragment
type to be considered here is the elided noun
phrase object. Such object eli&apos;sior_s occur more
widely in English in the context of instructions, as
In Handle _ with care. Cookbooks are especially
well-known respositories of elided objects, presum-
ably because they are filled with instructions.
Object elision also occurs in telegrammatic sub-
languages generally, as in Took _ under fire with
missiles from the Navy sighting messages. If these
omissions occurred only in direct object position
following the verb, one might argue for a lexical
treatment; that is, such omissions could be
treated as a lexical process of intransitivisation
rather than by explicitly representing gaps in the
syntactic structure. However, noun phrase objects
of prepositions may also be omitted, as in Fragile.
Do not tamper with _. Thus we have chosen to
represent such elisions with an explicit surface
structure gap. This gap is permitted in most con-
texts where nstgo (noun phrase object) is found:
as a direct object of the verb and as an object of
a preposition. 8 In PUNDIT, elided objects are
s Note, however, that there are some restrictions on the
occurrence of these elements. They seem not to occur in

<bodyText confidence="0.992623236842106">
permitted only in a fragment type called
obj...gap_fragment, which, like other fragment
types, may be attempted only if an assertion
parse has failed. Thus a sentence such as Pressure
was decreasing rapidly will never be analysed as
containing an elided object, because there is a
semantically acceptable assertion parse. In con-
trast, John was decreasing gradually will receive
an elided object analysis, paraphrasable as John
was decreasing IT gradually, because John is not
an acceptable subject of intransitive decrease;
only pressure or some equally measurable entity
may be said to decrease. This selectional failure
of the assertion parse permits the elided object
analysis.
Our working hypothesis for determining the
reference of object gaps is that they are, just like
subject gaps, appropriately treated as pronouns.
However, we have not as yet seen extensive data
relevant to this hypothesis, and it remains subject
to further testing.
These, then, are the fragment types
currently implemented in PUNDIT. As mentioned
above, we do not consider noun phrases without
determiners to be fragments, because it is not
clear that the missing element is syntactically
obligatory. The interpretation of these noun
phrases is treated as a pragmatic problem. In the
style of speech characteristic of the CASREPs,
determiners are nearly always omitted. Their
function must therefore be replaced by other
mechanisms. One possible approach to this prob-
lem would be to have the system try to determine
what the determiner would have been, had there
been one, insert it, and then resume processing as
if the determiner had been there all along. This
approach was taken by (Marsh19811. However,
it was rejected here for two reasons. The first is
that it was judged to be more error-prone than
simply equipping the reference resolution com-
ponent with the ability to handle noun phrases
without determiners directly. 9 The second reason
predicative objects, in double dative constructions, and,
perhaps, in sentence adjuncts rather than arguments of the
verb. (Thus compare Patient very ill. Do sot operate os
with Operetise room closed os SemIse. Do sot perform sur-
gery on_.) One possibility is that these expressions can occur
only where a definite pronoun would also be acceptable. In
general, object gaps seem most acceptable where they
represent an argument of a verb, either as direct object or as
object of a preposition selected for by a verb.
â¢ This ability would be required in any case, should the
system be extended to process languages which do not have
for not selecting this approach is that it would
eliminate the distinction between noun phrases
which originally had a determiner and those
which did not. At some point in the development
of the system it may become necessary to use this
information.
The basic approach currently taken is to
assume that the noun phrase is definite, that is, it
triggers a search through the discourse context
for a previously mentioned referent. If the search
succeeds, the noun phrase is assumed to refer to
that entity. If the search fails, a new discourse
entity is created.
In summary, then, these fragment types are
parsed &apos;as is&apos; at the surface level; dummy ele-
ments are inserted into the ISR to bring fragments
into close parallelism with full assertions.
Because of the resulting structural similarity
between these two sentence types, the semantic
and pragmatic components can apply exactly the
same interpretive processes to both fragments
and assertions, using pre-existing mechanisms to
&apos;fill in&apos; the holes detected by syntax.

serocopula with a non-participial complement,
such as pump inoperative.
A non-progressive serocopula fragment con-
taining a cognitive state verb, as in failure
believed due to worn bushings, is assigned a
present tense reading. However, if the lexical
verb has non-stative aspect,a e.g., tests conducted
(process) or new sac received (transition event)
then assignment of present tense conflicts with
the assumption that the mentioned situation has
occurred or is occurring. The simple present
tense form of verbs in this class is given a habi-
tual or iterative reading. That is, the
corresponding full sentences in the present, tests
are conducted and new sac is received, are inter-
preted as referring to types of situations that
tend to occur, rather than to situations that have
occurred. In order to permit actual temporal
reference, these fragments are assigned a past
tense reading.
Nstg_trag represents another case where
present tense may conflict with lexical aspect. If
an nstg_frag refers to a non-stative situation,
the situation is interpreted as having an actual
past time. This can be the case if the head of the
noun phrase is a nominalisation, and is derived
from a verb in the process or transition event
aspectual class. Thus, investigation of problem
would be interpreted as an actual process which
took place prior to the report time, and similarly,
sac failure would be interpreted as a past transi-
tion event. On the other hand, an nstg_frag
which refers to a stative situation, as in inopera-
tive pump, is assigned present tense.

5. RELATION OF FRAGMENTS TO THE
LARGER GRAMMAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999769875">
An important finding which has emerged
from the investigation of sentence fragments in a
variety of sublanguage domains is that the
linguistic properties of these constructions are
largely domain-independent. Assuming that these
sentence fragments remain constant across
different sublanguages, what is their relationship
to the language at large? As indicated above, we

believe that fragments should not be regarded as
ERRORS, a position taken also by [Lehrberger1982,
Marsh1983], and others. Fragments do occur
with disproportionate frequency in some domains,
such as field reports of mechanical failure or
newspaper headlines. However, despite this fre-
quency variation, it appears that the parser&apos;s
preferences remain constant across domains.
Therefore, even in telegraphic domains the prefer-
ence is for a full assertion parse, if one is avail-
able. As discussed above, we have enforced this
preference by means of the xor (&apos;unbacktrack-
able&apos; or) connective. Thus despite the greater
frequency of fragments we do not require either a
grammar or a preference structure different from
that of standard English in order to apply the
stable system grammar to these telegraphic mes-
sages.
Others have argued against this view of the
relationship between sublanguages and the
language at large. For example, Fitzpatrick et al.
[Fitspatrick1988] propose that fragments are sub-
ject to a constraint quite unlike any found in
English generally. Their Transitivity Con-
straint (Tc) requires that if a verb occurs as a
transitive in a sublanguage with fragmentary
messages, then it may not also occur in an intran-
sitive form, even if the verb is ambiguous in the
language at large. This constraint, they argue,
provides evidence that sublanguage grammars
have &amp;quot;a life of their own&amp;quot;, since there is no such
principle governing standard languages. The TC
would also cut down on ambiguities arising out
of object deletion, since a verb would be permit-
ted to occur transitively or intransitively in a
given subdomain, but not both.
As the authors recognise, this hypothesis
runs into difficulty in the face of verbs such as
resume (we find both Sac resumed normal opera-
tion and Noise has resumed), since resume occurs
both transitively and intransitively in these cases.
For these cases, the authors are forced to appeal
to a problematic analysis of resume as syntacti-
cally transitive in both cases; they analyse The
noise has resumed, for example, as deriving from
a structure of the form (Someone/ something)
resumed the noise; that is, it is analysed as under-
lying&apos;&apos;, transitive. Other transitivity alternations
which present potential counter-examples are
treated as syntactic gapping processes. In fact,
with these two mechanisms available, it is not
clear what COULD provide a counter-example to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996733">

<bodyText confidence="0.99957425">
the TU. The effect of all this insulation is to
render the Transitivity Constraint vacuous. If all
transitive/intransitive alternations can be treated
as underlyingly transitive, then of course there
will be no counter-examples to the transitivity
constraint. Therefore we see no evidence that
sublanguage grammars are subject to additional
constraints of this nature.
In summary, this supports the view that
fragmentary constructions in English are regular,
grammatically constrained ellipses differing
minimally from the standard language, rather
than ill-formed, unpredictable sublanguage exo-
tica.. Within a modular system such as PUNDIT
this regularity can be captured with the limited
augmentations of the grammar described above.
