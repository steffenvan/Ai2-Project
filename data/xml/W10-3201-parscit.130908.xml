Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999513458333333">
In this paper we propose a framework
of verb semantic description in order to
organize different granularity of similar-
ity between verbs. Since verb mean-
ings highly depend on their arguments
we propose a verb thesaurus on the ba-
sis of possible shared meanings with
predicate-argument structure. Motiva-
tions of this work are to (1) construct a
practical lexicon for dealing with alter-
nations, paraphrases and entailment re-
lations between predicates, and (2) pro-
vide a basic database for statistical learn-
ing system as well as a theoretical lex-
icon study such as Generative Lexicon
and Lexical Conceptual Structure. One
of the characteristics of our description
is that we assume several granularities
of semantic classes to characterize verb
meanings. The thesaurus form allows us
to provide several granularities of shared
meanings; thus, this gives us a further re-
vision for applying more detailed analy-
ses of verb meanings.

<bodyText confidence="0.978489576923077">
In natural language processing, to deal with
similarities/differences between verbs is essen-
tial not only for paraphrase but also textual en-
tailment and QA system which are expected
to extract more valuable facts from massively
large texts such as the Web. For example, in
the QA system, assuming that the body text
says “He lent her a bicycle”, the answer of the
question “He gave her a bicycle?” should be
“No”, however the answer of “She rented the
bicycle?” should be “Yes”. Thus construct-
ing database of verb similarities/differences en-
ables us to deal with detailed paraphrase/non-
paraphrase relations in NLP.
From the view of the current language re-
source, how the shared/different meanings of
“He lent her a bicycle” and “He gave her a bi-
cycle” can be described? The shared mean-
ing of lend and give in the above sentences is
that they are categorized to Giving Verbs, as
in Levin’s English Verb Classes and Alterna-
tions (EVCA) (Levin, 1993), while the different
meaning will be that lend does not imply own-
ership of the theme, i.e., a bicycle. One of the
problematic issues with describing shared mean-
ing among verbs is that semantic classes such as
Giving Verbs should be dependent on the gran-
ularity of meanings we assumed. For example,
the meaning of lend and give in the above sen-
tences is not categorized into the same Frame
in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). The reason
for this different categorization can be consid-
ered to be that the granularity of the semantic
class of Giving Verbs is larger than that of the
Giving Frame in FrameNet1. From the view of
natural language processing, especially dealing
the with propositional meaning of verbs, all of
the above classes, i.e., the wider class of Giv-
ing Verbs containing lend and give as well as
the narrower class of Giving Frame containing
give and donate, are needed. Therefore, in this
work, in order to describe verb meanings with
several granularities of semantic classes, a the-
saurus form is adopted for our verb dictionary.
Based on the background, this paper presents
a thesaurus of predicate-argument structure for
verbs on the basis of a lexical decompo-
sitional framework such as Lexical Concep-
tual Structure (Jackendoff, 1990); thus our
1We agree with the concept of Frame and FrameEle-
ments in FrameNet but what we propose in this paper is the
necessity for granularities of Frames and FrameElements.

proposed thesaurus can deal with argument
structure level alternations such as causative,
transitive/intransitive, stative. Besides, tak-
ing a thesaurus form enables us to deal with
shared/differenciate meaning of verbs with con-
sistency, e.g., a verb class node of “lend” and
“rent” can be described in the detailed layer of
the node “give”.
We constructed this thesaurus on Japanese
verbs and the current status of the verb thesaurus
is this: we have analyzed 7,473 verb meanings
(4,425 verbs) and organized the semantic classes
in a five-layer thesaurus with 71 semantic roles
types. Below, we describe background issues,
basic design issues, what kind of problems re-
main, limitations and perspectives of applica-
tions.

2 Existing Lexical Resources and
Drawbacks

2.1 Lexical Resources in English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982515151515">
From the view of previous lexical databases
In English, several well-considered lexical
databases are available, e.g., EVCA, Dorr’s
LCS (Dorr, 1997), FrameNet, WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998), VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)
and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). Be-
sides there is the research project (Pustejovsky
and Meyers, 2005) to find general descriptional
framework of predicate argument structure by
merging several lexical databases such as Prop-
Bank, NomBank, TimeBank and PennDiscouse
Treebank.
Our approach corresponds partly to each
lexical database, (i.e., FrameNet’s Frame and
FrameElements correspond to our verb class
and semantic role labels, and the way to orga-
nize verb similarity classes with thesaurus cor-
responds with WordNet’s synset), but is not
exactly the same; namely, there is no lex-
ical database describing several granularities
of semantic classes between verbs with argu-
ments. Of course, since the above English lex-
ical databases have links with each other, it is
possible to produce a verb dictionary with sev-
eral granularities of semantic classes with argu-
ments. However, the basic categories of classify-
ing verbs would be little different due to the dif-
ferent background theory of each English lexical
database; it must be not easy to add another level
of semantic granularity with keeping consistency
for all the lexical databases; thus, thesaurus form
is needed to be a core form for describing verb
meanings2.

2.2 Lexical Resources in Japanese
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999421678571428">
In previous studies, several Japanese lexicons
were published: IPAL (IPA, 1986) focuses on
morpho-syntactic classes but IPAL is small3.
EDR (Jap, 1995) consists of a large-scale lex-
icon and corpus (See Section 3.4). EDR is
a well-considered and wide coverage dictio-
nary focusing on translation between Japanese
and English, but EDR’s semantic classes were
not designed with linguistically-motivated lex-
ical relations between verbs, e.g., alternations,
causative, transitive, and detransitive relations
between verbs. We believe these relations must
be key for dealing with paraphrase in NLP.
Recently Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al.,
2006) and Japanese WordNet (Bond et al., 2008)
are proposed. Japanese FrameNet currently
published only less than 100 verbs4. Besides
Japanese WordNet contains 87000 words and
46000 synsets, however, there are three major
difficulty of dealing with paraphrase relations
between verbs: (1) there is no argument informa-
tion; (2) existing many similar synsets force us to
solve fine disambiguation between verbs when
we map a verb in a sentence to WordNet; (3) the
basic verbs of Japanese (i.e., highly ambiguous
verbs) are wrongly assigned to unrelated synsets
because they are constructed by translation from
English to Japanese.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.998551363636364">
2As Kipper (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) showed in their
examples mapping between VerbNet and WordNet verb
senses, most of the mappings are many-to-many relations;
this indicates that some two verbs grouped in a same se-
mantic type in VerbNet can be categorized into different
synsets in WordNet. Since WordNet does not have argu-
ment structure nor syntactic information, we cannot pur-
chase what is the different features for between the synsets.
3It contains 861 verbs and 136 adjectives.
4We are supplying our database to Japanese FrameNet
project.

3 Thesaurus of Predicate-Argument
Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999764">
The proposed thesaurus of predicate-argument
structure can deal with several levels of verb
classes on the basis of granularity of defined verb
meaning. In the thesaurus we incorporate LCS-
based semantic description for each verb class
that can provide several argument structure such
as construction grammar (Goldberg, 1995). This
must be high advantage to describe the different
factors from the view of not only syntactic func-
tions but also internal semantic relations. Thus
this characteristics of the proposed thesaurus can
be powerful framework for calculating similar-
ity and difference between verb senses. In the
following sections we explain the total design of
thesaurus and the details.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999101">
3.1 Design of Thesaurus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9954148">
The proposed thesaurus consists of hierarchy of
verb classes we assumed. A verb class, which
is a conceptual class, has verbs with a shared
meaning. A parent verb class includes concepts
of subordinate verb class; thus a subordinate
verb class is a concretization of the parent verb
class. A verb class has a semantic description
that is a kind of semantic skeleton inspired from
lexical conceptual structure (Jackendoff, 1990;
Kageyama, 1996; Dorr, 1997). Thus a seman-
tic description in a verb class describes core se-
mantic relations between arguments and shadow
arguments of a shared meaning of the verb class.
Since verb can be polysemous, each verb sense is
designated with example sentences. Verb senses
with a shared meaning are assigned to a verb
class. Every example sentence is analyzed into
their arguments and semantic role types; and
then their arguments are linked to variables in se-
mantic description of verb class. This indicates
that one semantic description in a verb class can
provide several argument structure on the basis
of syntactic structure. This architecture is related
to construction grammar.
Here we explain this structure using verbs
such as rent, lend, give, hire, borrow, lease. We
assume that each verb sense we focus on here is
designated by example sentences, e.g., “Mother
gives a book to her child”, “Kazuko rents a bicy-
cle from her friend”, and “Taro lend a car to his
friend”. As Figure 1 shows that all of the above
verb senses are involved in the verb class Moving
of One’s Possession 5. The semantic description,
which expresses core meaning of the verb class
Moving of One’s Possession is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6606825">
([Agent] CAUSE)
BECOME [Theme] BE AT [Goal].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988303">
Where the brackets [] denote variables that can
be filled with arguments in example sentences.
Likewise parentheses () denote occasional factor.
“Agent” and “Theme” are semantic role labels
that can be annotated to all example sentences.
Figure 1 shows that the children of the verb
class Moving of One’s Possession are the two
verb classes Moving of One’s Possession/Renting
and Moving of One’s Possession/Lending. In the
Renting class, rent, hire and borrow are there,
while in the Lending class, lend and lease exist.
Both of the semantic descriptions in the children
verb classes are more detailed ones than the par-
ent’s description.

notated to all of the example sentences, the vari-
ables in the semantic description can be linked
to practical arguments in example sentences via
semantic role labels (See Figure 2).

3.2 Construction of Verb Class Hierarchy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963869565217">
To organize hierarchical semantic verb class, we
take a top down and a bottom up approaches. As
for a bottom up approach, we use verb senses
defined by a dictionary as the most fine-grained
meaning; and then we group verbs that can be
considered to share some meaning. As for a dic-
tionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita et
al., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000
verbs with explanations of word sense and ex-
ample sentences.
As a top down approach, we take three se-
mantic classes: State, Change of State, and Ac-
tivity as top level semantic classes of the the-
saurus according to Vendler’s aspectual analy-
sis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4). This is be-
cause the above three classes can be useful for
dealing with the propositional, especially, resul-
tative aspect of verbs. For example “He threw a
ball” can be an Activity and have no special re-
sult; but “He broke the door” can be a Change of
State and then we can imagine a result, i.e., bro-
ken door. When other verb senses can express
the same results, e.g., “He destroyed the door,”
we would like to regard them as having the same
meaning.
We define verb classes in intermediate hierar-
chy by grouping verb sense on the basis of aspec-
tual category (i.e., action, state, change of state),
argument type (i.e., physical, mental, informa-
tion), and more detailed aspects depending on
aspectual category. For example, walk the coun-
try, travel all over Europe and get up the stairs
can be considered to be in the Move on Path
class.
Verb class is essential for dealing with verb
meanings as synsets in WordNet. Even if we had
given an incorrect class name, the thesaurus will
work well if the whole hierarchy keeps is-a rela-
tion, namely, the hierarchy does not contain any
multiple inheritance.
The most fine-grained verb class before in-
dividual verb sense is a little wider than alter-
nations. Currently, for the fine-grained verb
class, we are organizing what kind of differenti-
ated classes can be assumed (e.g., manner, back-
ground, presupposition, and etc.).

3.3 Semantic Role Labels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998453181818182">
The aim of describing arguments of a target verb
sense is (1) to link the same role arguments in
a related verb sense and (2) to provide disam-
biguated information for mapping a surface ex-
pression to a verb sense. The Lexeed database
provides a representative sentence for each word
sense. The sentence is simple, without adjunc-
tive elements such as unessential time, location
or method. Thus, a sentence is broken down into
subject and object, and semantic role labels are
annotated to them (Figure 3).

do not know how many arguments are enough.
This can be solved by adding examples6; how-
ever, we consider the semantic role labels of each
representative sentence in a verb class as an ex-
ample of assumed argument structure to a verb
class. That is to say, we regard a verb class as a
concept of event and suppose it to be a fixed ar-
gument frame for each verb class. The argument
frame is described as compositional relations.
The principal function of the semantic role la-
bel name is to link arguments in a verb class.
One exception is the Agent label. This can be a
marker discriminating transitive and intransitive
verbs. Since the semantic class of the thesaurus
focuses on Change of State, transitive alternation
cases such as “The president expands the busi-
ness” and “ The business expands” can be cate-
gorized into the same verb class. Then, these two
examples are differentiated by the Agent label.

3.4 Compositional Semantic Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999358">
As described in Section 3.1, we incorporate com-
positional semantic structure to each verb class
to describe syntactically motivated lexical se-
mantic relations and entailment meanings that
will expand the thesaurus. The benefit of com-
positional style is to link entailed meanings by
means of compositional manner. As an example
of entailment, Figure 5 shows that a verb class
Move to Goal entails Theme to be Goal, and this
corresponds to a verb class Exist.

In this verb thesaurus, being different from
previous LCS studies, we try to ensure the com-
positional semantic description as much as pos-
sible by means of linking each sub-event struc-
ture to both a semantic class and example sen-
tences. Therefore, we believe that our verb the-
saurus can provide a basic example data base for
LCS study.

Table 1 and Table 2 show a comparison of sta-
tistical characteristics with existing resources. In
the tables, WN and Exp denote the number of
word meanings and example sentences, respec-
tively. Also, SRL denotes the number corre-
sponding to semantic role label.
Looking at number of concepts, our Thesaurus
has 709 types of concepts (verb classes) which
is similar to FrameNet and more than VerbNet.
This seems to be natural because FrameNet is
also language resource constructed on argument
structure. Thanks to our thesaurus format, if we
need more fine grained concepts, we can expand
our thesaurus by adding concepts as new nodes
at the lowest layer in the hierarchy. While at the
number of SRL, FrameNet has much more types
than our thesaurus, and in the other resources
VerbNet and EDR the number of SRL is less than
our thesaurus. This comes from the different de-
sign issue of semantic role labels. In FrameNet
they try to differentiate argument types on the ba-
sis of the assumed concept, i.e., Frame. In con-
trast with FrameNet we try to merge the same
type of meaning in arguments. VerbNet and
EDR also defined abstracted SRL; The differ-
ence between their resources and our thesaurus
is that our SRLs are defined taking into account
what kind of roles in the core concept i.e., verb
class; while SRLs in VerbNet and EDR are not
dependent on verb’s class.
Table 2 shows that our thesaurus does not have
large number in registered words and examples
comparing to EDR and JWordNet. As we stated
in Section 3.5, the coverage of our verb class to
newspaper articles are high, but we try to add ex-
amples by constructing annotated Japanese cor-
pus of SRL and verb class.

4.2 Limitations of Developed Thesaurus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992950578947368">
One of the difficulties of annotating the seman-
tic class of word sense is that a word sense can
be considered as several semantic classes. The
proposed verb thesaurus can deal with multiple
semantic classes for a verb sense by adding them
into several nodes in the thesaurus. However,
this does not seem to be the correct approach.
For example, what kind of Change of State se-
mantic class can be considered in the following
sentence?
a. He took on a passenger.
Assuming that passenger is Theme, Move to goal
could be possible when we regard the vehicle9 as
Goal. In another semantic class, Change State of
Container could be possible when we regard the
vehicle as a container. Currently, all of the verb
senses are linked to only one semantic class that
can be considered as the most related semantic
class.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.64263675">
9Vehicle does not appear in the surface expression but
vehicle can exist. We currently describe the shadow argu-
ment in the compositional description, but it would be hard
to prove the existence of a shadow argument.

<bodyText confidence="0.96605564">
From the user side, i.e., dealing with the
propositional meaning of the sentence (a.), vari-
ous meanings should be estimated. Consider the
following sentence:
b. Thus, we were packed.
As the semantic class of the sentence (a.)
Change State of Container could better explain
why they are packed in the sentence (b.)
The other related issue is how we describe the
scope, e.g.,
c. He is hospitalized.
If we take the meaning as a simple manner, Move
to Goal can be a semantic class. This can be
correct from the view of annotation, but we can
guess he cannot work or he will have a tough
time as following events. FrameNet seems to be
able to deal with this by means of a special type
of linking between Frames.
Consequently, we think the above issues of se-
mantic class should depend on the application
side’s demands. Since we do not know all of the
requirements of NLP applications currently, then
it must be sufficient to provide an expandable de-
scriptional framework of linguistically motivated
lexical semantics.

One of the aims of the proposed dictionary is to
identify the sentences that have the same mean-
ings among different expressions. One of the
challenging paraphrase relations is that the sen-
tences expressed from the different view points.
Given the buying and selling in Figure 6, a hu-
man can understand that both sentences denote
almost the same event from different points of
view. This indicates that the sentences made by
humans usually contain the point of view of the
speaker. This is similar to a camera, and we need
to normalize the expressions as to their original
meaning.
We consider that NLP application researchers
need to relate these expressions. Logically, if we
know “buy” and “sell” have shared meanings of
giving and taking things, we can describe their

relations with “or” in logical form. Therefore,
finding and describing these verb relations will
be essential for dealing with propositional mean-
ings of a sentence.
For further view of application, event match-
ing to find a similar situation in Web documents
is supposed to be a practical and useful appli-
cation. Assuming that a user is confronted with
the fact that wireless LAN in the user’s PC does
not work, and the user wants to search for doc-
uments that provide a solution, the problem is
that expressions of situations must be different
from the views of individual writers, e.g., “wire-
less LAN did not work” or “wireless LAN was
disconnected”. How can we find the same mean-
ing in these expressions, and how can we ex-
tract the answers by finding the same situation
from FAQ documents? To solve this, a lexical
database describing verb relations between “go
wrong” and “disconnect” must be the base for
estimating how the expressions can be similar.
Therefore, constructing a lexicon can be worth-
while for developing NLP applications.

semantic granularities using a thesaurus form
with argument structure. Semantic granularity
is the basis for how we categorize (or recognize
which semantic class relates to a verb meaning).
Also, we ensure functions and limitations of se-
mantic classes and argument structure from the
viewpoint of dealing with paraphrases. That is,
required semantic classes will be highly depen-
dent on applications; thus, the framework of the
verb-sense dictionary should have expandability.
The proposed verb thesaurus can take several se-
mantic granularities; therefore, we hope the verb
thesaurus will be applicable to NLP’s task10.
In future work, we will continue to organize
differentiated semantic classes between verbs
and develop a system to identify the same event
descriptions.

<abstract confidence="0.9988546">In this paper we propose a framework of verb semantic description in order to organize different granularity of similarity between verbs. Since verb meanings highly depend on their arguments we propose a verb thesaurus on the basis of possible shared meanings with predicate-argument structure. Motivations of this work are to (1) construct a practical lexicon for dealing with alternations, paraphrases and entailment relations between predicates, and (2) provide a basic database for statistical learning system as well as a theoretical lexicon study such as Generative Lexicon and Lexical Conceptual Structure. One of the characteristics of our description is that we assume several granularities of semantic classes to characterize verb meanings. The thesaurus form allows us to provide several granularities of shared meanings; thus, this gives us a further revision for applying more detailed analyses of verb meanings.</abstract>

One of the problematic issues with describing shared meaning among verbs is that semantic classes such as Giving Verbs should be dependent on the granularity of meanings we assumed. For example, the meaning of lend and give in the above sentences is not categorized into the same Frame in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). The reason for this different categorization can be considered to be that the granularity of the semantic class of Giving Verbs is larger than that of the Giving Frame in FrameNet1. From the view of natural language processing, especially dealing the with propositional meaning of verbs, all of the above classes, i.e., the wider class of Giving Verbs containing lend and give as well as the narrower class of Giving Frame containing give and donate, are needed.

EDR (Jap, 1995) consists of a large-scale lexicon and corpus (See Section 3.4). EDR is a well-considered and wide coverage dictionary focusing on translation between Japanese and English, but EDR’s semantic classes were not designed with linguistically-motivated lexical relations between verbs, e.g., alternations, causative, transitive, and detransitive relations between verbs. We believe these relations must be key for dealing with paraphrase in NLP. Recently Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2006) and Japanese WordNet (Bond et al., 2008) are proposed. Japanese FrameNet currently published only less than 100 verbs4. Besides Japanese WordNet contains 87000 words and 46000 synsets, however, there are three major difficulty of dealing with paraphrase relations between verbs: (1) there is no argument information; (2) existing many similar synsets force us to solve fine disambiguation between verbs when we map a verb in a sentence to WordNet; (3) the basic verbs of Japanese (i.e., highly ambiguous verbs) are wrongly assigned to unrelated synsets because they are constructed by translation from English to Japanese. 2As Kipper (Kippe</context>

A verb class, which is a conceptual class, has verbs with a shared meaning. A parent verb class includes concepts of subordinate verb class; thus a subordinate verb class is a concretization of the parent verb class. A verb class has a semantic description that is a kind of semantic skeleton inspired from lexical conceptual structure (Jackendoff, 1990; Kageyama, 1996; Dorr, 1997). Thus a semantic description in a verb class describes core semantic relations between arguments and shadow arguments of a shared meaning of the verb class. Since verb can be polysemous, each verb sense is designated with example sentences. Verb senses with a shared meaning are assigned to a verb class. Every example sentence is analyzed into their arguments and semantic role types; and then their arguments are linked to variables in semantic description of verb class.

Figure 2: Linking between semantic description and example sentences. 3.2 Construction of Verb Class Hierarchy To organize hierarchical semantic verb class, we take a top down and a bottom up approaches. As for a bottom up approach, we use verb senses defined by a dictionary as the most fine-grained meaning; and then we group verbs that can be considered to share some meaning. As for a dictionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita et al., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000 verbs with explanations of word sense and example sentences. As a top down approach, we take three semantic classes: State, Change of State, and Activity as top level semantic classes of the thesaurus according to Vendler’s aspectual analysis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4). This is because the above three classes can be useful for dealing with the propositional, especially, resultative aspect of verbs. For example “He threw a ball” can be an Activity and have no special result; but “He broke the door” can be a Change of State and then we can imagine a resul</context>

EDR (Jap, 1995) consists of a large-scale lexicon and corpus (See Section 3.4). EDR is a well-considered and wide coverage dictionary focusing on translation between Japanese and English, but EDR’s semantic classes were not designed with linguistically-motivated lexical relations between verbs, e.g., alternations, causative, transitive, and detransitive relations between verbs. We believe these relations must be key for dealing with paraphrase in NLP. Recently Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2006) and Japanese WordNet (Bond et al., 2008) are proposed. Japanese FrameNet currently published only less than 100 verbs4. Besides Japanese WordNet contains 87000 words and 46000 synsets, however, there are three major difficulty of dealing with paraphrase relations between verbs: (1) there is no argument information; (2) existing many similar synsets force us to solve fine disambiguation between verbs when we map a verb in a sentence to WordNet; (3) the basic verbs of Japanese (i.e., highly ambiguous verbs) are wrongly assigned to unrelated synsets because they are constructed by translation fr</context>

As for a bottom up approach, we use verb senses defined by a dictionary as the most fine-grained meaning; and then we group verbs that can be considered to share some meaning. As for a dictionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita et al., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000 verbs with explanations of word sense and example sentences. As a top down approach, we take three semantic classes: State, Change of State, and Activity as top level semantic classes of the thesaurus according to Vendler’s aspectual analysis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4). This is because the above three classes can be useful for dealing with the propositional, especially, resultative aspect of verbs. For example “He threw a ball” can be an Activity and have no special result; but “He broke the door” can be a Change of State and then we can imagine a result, i.e., broken door. When other verb senses can express the same results, e.g., “He destroyed the door,” we would like to regard them as having the same meaning. We define verb classes in intermediate hierarchy by grouping verb sense on the basis of aspectual category (i.e., action, state, cha</context>
