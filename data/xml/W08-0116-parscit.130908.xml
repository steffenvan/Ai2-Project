This paper presents a coding protocol that al-
lows naïve users to annotate dialogue tran-
scripts for anaphora and ellipsis. Cohen&apos;s
kappa statistic demonstrates that the protocol
is sufficiently robust in terms of reliability. It
is proposed that quantitative ellipsis data may
be used as an index of mutual-engagement.
Current and potential uses of ellipsis coding
are described.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990572">
Spontaneously generated dialogue, whether natu-
rally occurring or task-oriented, rarely sticks to
accepted rules of grammar or even politeness. In-
terruptions, ungrammatical utterances and grunts
or other noises are found in the majority of contri-
butions in dialogue corpora. One reason for this is
the ubiquitous use of ellipsis; the omission of
words or phrases from a contribution which can be
inferred or extracted from previous contributions.
Ellipsis is optional; the full constituent could serve
communication as well as the elliptical version.
Where ellipsis occurs across speakers i.e., one par-
ticipant makes (elliptical) use of another’s contri-
bution, it provides a direct index of the mutual-
accessibility of the current conversational context
(cf. Healey et. al. 2007; Eshghi and Healey, 2007).
In some cases elliptical contributions are obvi-
ous, as in the polar response &apos;yeah&apos;, signifying that
a question has been heard, understood and consid-
ered; however, there are degrees of complexity that
would seem to require a close understanding of
what another participant is referring to. It is this
issue of mutual-accessibility or &apos;grounding&apos; that we
propose can be investigated through the quantifica-
tion of elliptical phenomena. These phenomena
are, we propose, also related to the way referring
expressions can contract over repeated use. (e.g.
Schober and Clark, 1989; Wilkes-Gibbs and Clark,
1992). The approach taken in Clark et al.&apos;s &apos;col-
laborative theory&apos; is that as mutual understanding
increases, dialogue contributions become shorter as
referring terms become part of the common
ground. Clark and Krych (2004) note that various
elliptical phrases can be used to establish common
ground, from continuers (&apos;uh-huh&apos;, &apos;yeah&apos;) or as-
sessments (&apos;gosh&apos;) to establishing shared attention
through deictic expressions such as &apos;this&apos;, &apos;that&apos;,
&apos;here&apos; and &apos;there&apos;.
Healey et al. (2007) demonstrated the basic con-
cept and viability of quantifying ellipsis phenom-
ena as a quantitative index of mutual-accessibility
of context. They showed that the frequency of use
of cross-speaker elliptical expressions in online
chat varies systematically depending on whether
communication is ‘local’ i.e. within a single chat
room or ‘remote’. However, the coding of ellipsis
in this study did not follow an explicit protocol. It
relied mainly on the distinctions made by Fernan-
dez et al. (2004) but specific measures of reliabil-
ity and validity were not calculated.

In this paper we present an ellipsis coding protocol
that provides a set of coding categories and we re-
port the inter-rater reliability scores that have been
obtained with it. In order to simplify coding and
increase reliability, categories suggested by Fer-
nandez et al. have been collapsed into broader
ones. It should be pointed out that we are not, in
general, trying to produce an accurate or definitive
analysis of ellipsis. The protocol is rather the prod-
uct of contending with the compromise between
robust coding categories and linguistic elegance.
The categories presented here are generally or-
dered in terms of occurrence in order to assist the
coder. A contribution to dialogue may contain
more than one type of elliptical utterance; contri-
butions are not assigned to one mutually exclusive
category. Rather, coders are able to use the proto-
col to label any part of a dialogue that is elliptical.

2. The Ellipsis Protocol
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996625">
The protocol is designed as a tool for coding one
aspect of dialogue, developed with the intention
that users with no specific knowledge of linguistics
can use it. As can be seen from Figures 1-4, it con-
sists of four binary branching decision trees that
are applied to each contribution in an interaction.
Full instructions for use of the protocol have also
been written and are available from the authors.

In order to demonstrate reliability between coders,
two coders (one computer scientist, one psycholo-
gist) applied the ellipsis protocol to a sample of
task oriented dialogue. This was taken from the
HCRC Map Task corpus (Anderson et al, 1991); a
series of dialogues in which one participant at-
tempts to describe a route on a fictional map to
another. The longest of these dialogues was chosen
to be coded (transcript Q1NC1) which consisted of
446 turns and 5533 words. Cohen&apos;s kappa was cal-
culated using the procedure outlined in Howell
(1994); see Carletta (1996) for a discussion of the
use of kappa in dialogue coding. Kappa in this in-
stance was .81, which shows very high reliability,
even by conservative standards (Krippendorff,

1980). Table 1 below presents a breakdown of the
instances of categories that were agreed upon.
Table 1 shows the total number and approximate
percentage of agreements. Also given, &apos;1.dis&apos; and
&apos;2.dis&apos; are the number of observed instances by
coders one and two respectively identified but dis-
puted for that particular category. The total number
of elliptical or non-elliptical instances coded, from
single words or phrases to entire turns was 624; of
these, 100 (16%) were disagreed upon and 78 in-
stances (12.5%) were agreed to contain no ellipti-
cal phenomena (no ellipsis disagreements = 50).
Some categories have very low frequencies; how-
ever, previous work suggests that these categories
are necessary. To some extent this table shows the
limitations of the kappa statistic; coder agreement
varies considerably across these categories.

Although mutual-accessibility of context is funda-
mental to communication, there has not been a re-
liable method for observing or measuring it. The
ellipsis protocol presented here thus provides a
useful step in this direction. It gives a standardised
coding scheme that can quantify the extent to
which speakers can directly access the constituents
of each other’s turns.
In previous work there have been several differ-
ent attempts to define taxonomies of elliptical or
context dependent utterances. For example, non-
sentential utterances (NSUs), e.g. Schlangen and
Lascarides (2003); Fernandez and Ginzburg
(2002); Fernandez, Ginzburg and Lappin (2007).
One issue with these previous approaches is the
lack of reliability data; a statistic such as Cohen’s
kappa is needed in order to demonstrate that a tax-
onomy or coding scheme can be reliably applied
between independent coders. Carletta et al. (1997)
presented a reliable coding scheme for the classifi-
cation of dialogue moves; although there are over-
laps between their categories and ours, the
questions used in the scheme are intended to estab-
lish solely the function of an utterance and impor-
tantly, not whether the utterance is elliptical. The
protocol presented here achieves a high level of
reliability for some of these context dependent
phenomena without requiring specific prior knowl-
edge of the relevant linguistic theory.
Further work will code a sample from the BNC
(Burnard, 2000) in order to allow comparisons
with previous taxonomies. The HCRC map task
corpus has previously been examined in terms of
various features of dialogue, e.g. Dialogue Games
Analysis (Kowtko et al, 1991) and disfluencies
(Lickley and Bard, 1998). Ongoing work will de-
velop this through coding the entire HCRC map
task corpus; providing data on how ellipsis varies
over different conditions such as medium, familiar-
ity and task role.

(1997) presented a reliable coding scheme for the classification of dialogue moves; although there are overlaps between their categories and ours, the questions used in the scheme are intended to establish solely the function of an utterance and importantly, not whether the utterance is elliptical.

Healey et al. (2007) demonstrated the basic concept and viability of quantifying ellipsis phenomena as a quantitative index of mutual-accessibility of context. They showed that the frequency of use of cross-speaker elliptical expressions in online chat varies systematically depending on whether communication is ‘local’ i.e. within a single chat room or ‘remote’. However, the coding of ellipsis in this study did not follow an explicit protocol. It relied mainly on the distinctions made by Fernandez et al. (2004) but specific measures of reliability and validity were not calculated. 96 Proceedings of the 9th SIGdia</context>

Discussion Although mutual-accessibility of context is fundamental to communication, there has not been a reliable method for observing or measuring it. The ellipsis protocol presented here thus provides a useful step in this direction. It gives a standardised coding scheme that can quantify the extent to which speakers can directly access the constituents of each other’s turns. In previous work there have been several different attempts to define taxonomies of elliptical or context dependent utterances. For example, nonsentential utterances (NSUs), e.g. Schlangen and Lascarides (2003); Fernandez and Ginzburg (2002); Fernandez, Ginzburg and Lappin (2007). One issue with these previous approaches is the lack of reliability data; a statistic such as Cohen’s kappa is needed in order to demonstrate that a taxonomy or coding scheme can be reliably applied between independent coders.
