This paper is focused on determining which pro-
teins affect the activity of Aryl Hydrocarbon Re-
ceptor (AHR) system when learning a model that
can accurately predict its activity when single
genes are knocked out. Experiments with results
are presented when models are trained on a single
source of information: abstracts from Medline
(http://medline.cos.com/) that talk about the genes in-
volved in the experiments. The results suggest that
AdaBoost classifier with a binary bag-of-words
representation obtains significantly better results.

2 Task Description and Data Sets
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998756823529412">
The task that we address is a biology-specific task
considered a competition track for KDDCup2002
(http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~craven/kddcup/winners.html).
The organizers of the KDD Cup competition
provided data obtained from experiments per-
formed on a set of yeast strains in which each
strain contains a single gene that is knocked out (a
gene sequence in which a single gene is inopera-
tive). Each experiment had associated a discretized
value of the activity of the AHR system when a
single gene was knocked out. 3 possible classes
describe the systems’ response. The &amp;quot;nc&amp;quot; label in-
dicates that the activity of the hidden system was
not significantly different than the baseline (the
wild-type yeast); the &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; label indicates that
the activity was significantly different than the
baseline for the given instance, and that the activity
of another hidden system (the control) was also
significantly changed compared to its baseline; the
&amp;quot;change&amp;quot; label shows that the activity of the hid-
den system was significantly changed, but the ac-
tivity of the control system was not significantly
changed.
The organizers of the KDD Cup evaluate the task
as a two-class problem with focus on the positive
class. The first definition is called the “narrow”
definition of the positive class and it is specific to
the knocked-out genes that had an AHR-specific
effect. In this case the positive class is defined by
the experiments in which the label of the system is
“change” and the negative examples are the ex-
periments that consist of those genes with either
the &amp;quot;nc&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; label. The second defini-
tion consists of those genes labeled with either the
&amp;quot;change&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; label. The negative class
consists of those genes labeled with the &amp;quot;nc&amp;quot; label.
The second partitioning corresponds to the
“broad” characterization of the positive class
genes that affect the hidden system.
The area under the Receiver Operating Charac-
teristic (ROC) - AUC curve is chosen as an evalua-
tion measure. The global score for the task will be
the summed AUC values for both the “narrow” and
the “broad” partition of the data.
The sources of information provided by the or-
ganizers of the task contain: hierarchical informa-
tion about the function and localization of the
genes; relational information describing the pro-
tein-protein interactions; and textual information in
abstracts from Medline that talk about the genes.
Some characteristics of the data need to be taken
into consideration in order to make suitable deci-
sions for choosing the trainable system/classifier,
the representation of the data, etc. Missing infor-
mation is a characteristic of the data set. Not all
genes had the location and function annotation, the
protein-protein interaction information, or abstracts
associated with the gene name. Besides the missing
information, the high class imbalance is another
fact that needs to be taken into account.
From the data that was released for the KDD
competition we run experiments only with the
genes that had associated abstracts. Table 1 pre-
sents a summary of the data sets used in our ex-
periments after considering only the genes that had
abstracts associated with them. The majority of the
genes had one abstract, while others had as many
as 22 abstracts.

Previous research on the task was done by the
teams that participated in the KDD Cup 2002. The
textual information available in the task was con-
sidered as an auxiliary source of information and
not the primary one, as in this article.
The winners of the task, Kowalczyk and Raskutti
(2002) used the textual information as additional
features to the ones extracted from other available
information for the genes. They used a “bag-of-
words” representation, removed stop words and
words with low frequency. They used Support
Vector machine (SVM) as a classifier.
Krogel et. al. (2002) used the textual information
with an information extraction system in order to
extract missing information (function, localization,
protein class) for the genes in the released data set.
Vogel and Axelrod (2002) used the Medline ab-
stracts to extract predictive keywords, and added
them to their global system.
Our study investigates and suggests a textual rep-
resentation and a trainable model suitable for this
task and similar tasks in the biomedical domain.

The method that we propose to solve the biology
task is using Machine Learning (ML) classifiers
suitable for a text classification task and various
feature representations that are known to work well
for data sets with high class imbalance. The task
becomes a two-class classification: “Positive” ver-
sus “Negative”, with a “narrow” and “broad”
definition for the positive class. As classification
algorithms we used: Complement Naive Bayes
(CNB), AdaBoost, and SVM all from the Weka
toolkit (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). Similar to
the evaluation done for the KDD Cup, we consider
the sum of the 2 AUC measures for the definitions
of the positive class as an evaluation score. The
random classifier with an AUC measure of 0.5 is
considered as a baseline.
As a representation technique we used binary
and frequency values for features that are: words
extracted from the abstracts (bag-of-words (BOW)
representation), UMLS concepts and UMLS
phrases identified using the MetaMap system
(http://mmtx.nlm.nih.gov/), and UMLS relations ex-
tracted from the UMLS metathesaurus. We also
ran experiments with feature selection techniques.
Table 2 presents our best results using AdaBoost
classifier for BOW, UMLS concepts, and UMLS
relations representation techniques. “B” stands for
binary and “Freq” stands for frequency counts.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996775">
Looking at the obtained results, a general conclu-
sion can be made: textual information is useful for
biology-specific tasks. Not only that it can improve
the results but can also be considered a stand-alone
source of knowledge in this domain. Without any
additional knowledge, our result of 1.21 AUC sum
is comparable with the sum of 1.23 AUC obtained
by the winners of the KDD competition.
