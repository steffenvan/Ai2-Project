<bodyText confidence="0.998861333333333">
Korean Word Associations (KorWA) were
collected to build a semantic network for the
Korean language. A graphic representation
approach of applying coefficients to complex
networks allows us to discern the semantic
structures within words. A semantic network
of the KorWA was found to exhibit the scale-
free property in its degree distribution. The
growth of the network around hub words was
also confirmed through two experimental
phases. As an issue for further research, we
suggest that the present results may yield in-
sights for computational neurolinguistics, as a
semantic network of word association norms
can bridge the gap between information about
lexical co-occurrences derived from a corpora
and anatomical networks as a basis for map-
ping out neural activations.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999384218181819">
Language is an intricate cognitive system. The
mental system, called a grammar by linguists, al-
lows human beings to form and interpret the
sounds, words, and sentences of their language.
The system is often broken down into several
components, such as phonetics, phonology, mor-
phology, syntax, and semantics (O&apos;Grady et al.
2005). Depending on one’s concerns, the basic
elements of each level (i.e. phones, syllables, mor-
phemes, words, or sentences) become the constitu-
ents of linguistic networks of sound patterns,
morphological structures, or syntactic organiza-
tions. Parse trees, for instance, which are often
used in analyzing the syntactic structures of sen-
tences, employ links to represent the syntagmatic
relationships between words. However, focusing
on the processes of conceptualizing feelings, ex-
periences, and perceptions and of encoding them in
words (namely, lexicalization), linguists have fre-
quently drawn another kind of linguistic network
substantiated as a map of words projecting seman-
tic structures and relations onto an Euclidian space
from a paradigmatic perspective. In that sense,
word association data is attractive in terms of ease
of data manipulation, especially when making a
graph from a list of word pairs. Moreover, the tools
for analyzing complex networks have been often
applied to analyzing the structural features within
large-scale word association data and to mining
lexical knowledge from them.
Since Galton (1880), word association has been
used as an empirical method for observing thought
processes, memory, and mental states within clini-
cal and cognitive psychology (Deese, 1965). From
a linguistic perspective, word associations are un-
doubtedly valuable language resources because
they are rich sources of linguistic knowledge and
lexical information. The data has some unique
characteristics that are very interesting and useful
for cultural studies, reflecting the life styles, social,
cultural and linguistic backgrounds of the native
speakers who contributed to the data collections.
Such information could be particularly useful for
further applications not only within semantic stud-
ies but also for intelligent information retrieval,
brain research, and language learning.
In short, so-called word association norms are
crucial as large-scale paradigmatic corpora. They
consist of word pair data based on psychological
experiments where the participants are typically
asked to provide a semantically-related response
word that comes to mind upon presentation of a
stimulus word. Two well-known word association
data for English are the University of South Florida
word association, rhyme and word fragment norms

(Nelson et al., 1998) and the Edinburgh Word As-
sociation Thesaurus of English (EAT; Kiss et al.,
1973). For Japanese there are Ishizaki&apos;s Associa-
tive Concept Dictionary (IACD) (Okamoto and
Ishizaki, 2001) and the Japanese Word Association
Database (JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2006, 2007). Util-
izing computational linguistic techniques that aim
to mathematically analyze their structures, raw as-
sociation data is often transformed into some form
of graph or complex network representation, where
the vertices stand for words and the edges indicate
an associative relationship (Miyake et al., 2007).
Such techniques of graph representation and their
analysis allow us to discern the patterns of connec-
tivity within large-scale resources of linguistic
knowledge and to perceive the inherent relation-
ships between words and word groups.
However, despite a long history of word associa-
tion studies and the valuable contributions of such
data to cognitive science, comprehensive, large-
scale databases of Korean word association norms
have been seriously inadequate. In one study, Lee
(1970) surveyed word associations based on 30
adjectives and 29 words representing colors, tar-
geting 40 university students and analyzed the re-
sponse words for associative tendencies in terms of
gender and grammatical word classes. More re-
cently, Shin (1998) attempted to categorize words
by conceptual systems in order to construct a lexi-
cal dictionary supporting foreign language learners.
Although her data differs from word association
norms and is not available as an accessible digital
database for academic purpose, the semantic clas-
sification of the words can be exploited in com-
plementing the analysis of Korean semantic
networks.
A collection of Korean word associations (for
short, KorWA) was planned and conducted with
the strong motivation of constructing a worthwhile
database of Korean word associations as a kind of
resource that has multiple applications in a number
of areas such as lexicography, language education,
artificial intelligent, natural language processing,
and cultural study. Moreover, we intend to share
the database on the web to foster these various po-
tential utilities.
In this paper, KorWA is represented into se-
mantic networks and examined by some combina-
torial methods in linguistics. The details are
presented from the whole process of collecting the
data to the results of the analysis based on the the-
ory of complex networks. Furthermore, this paper
briefly discusses another important characteristic,
dynamics in scale-free networks, which has re-
cently attracted much attention in this research
field. Finally we will mention the applicability of
the graph-based analysis developed here to the fu-
ture potential researches of the computational neu-
rolinguistics.

2.1 Design of Experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999369026315789">
Preparation of an association experiment begins
with the selection of a stimulus word set that is to
be presented to the respondent in order to initiate
their association process. Determining the stimu-
lus word set is a crucial part in designing the ex-
periment, as associative responses are greatly
influenced by the characteristics of the presented
words, in particular, the stimulus word familiarity
influences response heterogeneity, variability, rela-
tional categories, and reaction times (Deese 1965).
For the experiment of Korean word associations,
we referred to a list of 5,000 Korean basic words
(Seo et al. 1998), which was derived from the
Yonsei Corpora consisting of 42,644,891 words as
of 1998 [ILIS]. From the list, we compiled a list of
3,951 words, consisting of 2,628 nouns, 1,006
verbs, and 317 adjectives.
One hundred and thirty-two native Korean stu-
dents (71 males and 61 females) at Daejon Univer-
sity, South Korea voluntarily participated in the
experiment. The students were mainly from the
departments of Korean language and literature
(54%), physical therapy (30%), and philosophy
(11%). More than 70% of the students had educa-
tional background in the humanities. Most of the
students (93%) were in their 20s; 82% between 20
and 25 years old and 11% between 26 and 30 years
old. 14% of students answered that on average
they read more than five books in a month. The
task was conducted on the campus of Daejeon
University from September 2007 to February 2008.
It was a traditional pen-and-paper based task. Un-
der the control of an instructor, each session of the
task lasted for 30 minutes.
In the task, participants were instructed to write
down the response words that came to mind when
they looked at the presented words. We asked the
subjects to write down all the words that they

could think of from the presented words. This pro-
cedure is called the continuous free association
task, differing from the discrete association task
where the subject is asked to only write down their
first response (Cramer 1968).
As a means of naturally displaying continuous
associations, the respondents were asked to map
out their responses. That is, they drew a kind of
associative map for a given word, by adding a line
when they made an association and numbering the
responses according to the order in which they
came to mind from the stimulus word. In the ex-
periment, an A5 size booklet was distributed to the
participants. The booklet had 66 pages printed on
one-side, including 2 front-back cover pages.
extracted from the 3,951 stimulus set. Apart from
six of the 132 sets, the lists included 40 nouns, 15
verbs, and 5 adjectives. The others had slightly
different numbers of the syntactic categories.
However, eventually each stimulus word was
planned to be presented to up to two subjects.
As the result of approximately 6-month period
of data collection, we obtained 28,755 responses in
total for the 3,942 stimulus words (from the origi-
nal stimulus set, nine words failed to elicit any
word associations). The 28,755 responses (tokens)
consisted of 11,275 distinct words (types). Each
item was presented to two respondents.
The KorWA database (Figure 2) was con-
structed from the collected word association re-
sponses. The data is arranged into six fields; (1) the
part of speech of the stimulus word, (2) the stimu-
lus word, (3) the part of speech of the response, (4)
response order, (5) raw form of the response, and
(6) response word in standard form.

respondent information (gender, age, major, and
number of books read in a month), (3) an example

responses for 60 words.
In total, 132 booklets were prepared for the task.

2.2 Basic Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979454545455">
The Korean word association data collected is
briefly summarized here in terms of the relations
between the stimulus words and the responses to-
gether with some basic statistics. The participants
produced on average 218 responses (standard de-
viation = 63.8, ranging from 98 to 482) for the
complete set of 60 words in the free association
task, which corresponds to 3.6 responses per
stimulus word. Because each stimulus item was
presented to two respondents, each stimulus has on
average 7.3 association responses.

As already mentioned, our task was the continu-
ous free association task where the respondent was
allowed to provide more than one response, so
there is the possibility of chaining responses where
some association responses are elicited by prior
responses. The response set of 28,755 tokens in-
cludes all such responses. Furthermore, it is possi-
ble to extract the primary responses that were
given as the first response produced for each
stimulus word. In doing that, it is possible to con-
vert the continuous free association task condition
to the discrete association task employed in other
existing data. The primary associates for the 3,942
stimulus are 7,550 word tokens (4,197 types). The
associations seem to be related to the grammatical
classes of the stimulus. Ervin (1961) reports that
many associations tend to have the same gram-
matical class as the stimulus word. Similarly, Jen-
kins (1954) and Saporta (1955) provide an
interesting way of classifying association struc-
tures into two modes, i.e. paradigmatic associa-
tions and syntagmatic ones. In the former mode,
the stimulus and response fit a common grammati-
cal paradigm. For example, the word ACTION
yields the associates of WORDS, LIFE,
MOVEMENT, MOTION, GAME, and so on,
which are not likely to occur as sequences in eve-
ryday English. In the latter case, the stimulus and
response are generally contiguous, occupying dif-
ferent positions within phrases or sentences.
Namely, they often form sequences, as in the rela-
tions between the stimulus word of
ADMINISTRATIVE and its common associates of
DUTY, JOB, CONTROL, DISCIPLINE, POWER,
BUREAUCRATS, POSITION, AGENCY,
ENTITY, SCHOOL, BOSS, GOVERNMENT,
RULE, etc. (Deese 1965). Deese (1962) clarified
the relative frequencies of paradigmatic and syn-
tagmatic associations among the grammatical
classes of English, especially with nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs in his study. He observed
that the tendency towards paradigmatic or syntag-
matic association varied with word class; nouns are
dominantly paradigmatic, while adjectives and
verbs tend to be both paradigmatic and syntag-
matic. In the case of adjectives, it is a particularly
interesting tendency for the association types to
have a strong correlation with frequency of usage.
That is to say, for common adjectives, associations
are more likely to be paradigmatic (e.g. for HOT,
associates such as COLD, WARM, and COOL
more frequently occur than WOMEN, WEATHER,
and the like), while uncommon adjectives are more
syntagmatic (e.g. for ADMINISTRATIVE, associ-
ates such as DUTY, GOVERNMENT, and RULE
are more often produced than SUPERVISORY,
EXECUTIVE, and so on). What is more, most
paradigmatic associates to adjectives are either
synonymous with the stimulus (COLD—COOL) or
the opposite of the stimulus (COLD—HOT). Com-
mon adjectives overwhelmingly have more anto-
nyms as their response, but relatively low-frequent
adjectives have more synonym associations.
A similar tendency is observed in our data,
which included three types of grammatical class
among the stimulus items, with nouns, verbs, and
adjectives, covering 66.5%, 25.5%, and 8% of the
stimulus set respectively. The different proportions
of the word classes reflects their frequencies within
the Yonsei corpora, i.e. among the 5,000 most fre-
quent words, there is a much larger number of
nouns, compared to verbs and adjectives. By tag-
ging the responses with parts of speech data during
the course of constructing the database, we can
analyze the distributions of grammatical categories
among the responses. The responses were over-
whelmingly nouns (78%), followed by adjectives
(7%), proper nouns (4.5%) and verbs (4.4%) in
descending order. Within the primary response list,
the distributions of word class are not greatly dif-
ferent, with 79% nouns, 6.7% adjectives, 4.8%
verbs, 3.9% proper nouns, and around 6% others.
Corresponding to the grammatical class of the
stimulus specifically, nouns are also the dominant
responses. When considering just the primary re-
sponses, noun stimulus elicited mostly noun re-
sponses (80%), followed by adjectives (6%),
proper nouns (5%), and verbs (3%); verb stimulus
produced around 80% noun associates, 10% verbs
and 4% adjectives; while for adjective stimulus,
there were 70% noun responses, 19% adjectives,
and 2% verbs. In short, we found a majority of
noun—noun, verb—noun, and adjective—noun com-
binations within the stimulus—response relations.
This demonstrates the association tendency for
nouns to strongly elicit paradigmatic associations,
as seen from the principal noun—noun relations,
while verbs and adjectives tend to yield more syn-
tagmatic associations, as seen from the major rela-
tions of verb—noun and adjective—noun.

Degrees: Recently, a number of studies have ap-
plied graph theory approaches in investigating lin-
guistic knowledge resources. For instance, instead
of word frequency based computations, Dorow, et
al (2005) utilize graph clustering techniques as
methods of detecting lexical ambiguity and of ac-
quiring semantic classes. Steyvers and Tenenbaum
(2005) conducted a noteworthy study that exam-
ined the structural features of three semantic net-
works (free association norms of Nelson et al.,
Roget&apos;s thesaurus, and WordNet). By calculating a
range of statistical features, including the average
shortest paths, diameters, clustering coefficients,
and degree distributions, they observed interesting
similarities between three networks in terms of
their scale-free patterns of connectivity and small-
world structures. Following their basic approach,
we analyze the characteristics of the semantic net-
work representation of KorWA by calculating the
statistical features of the graph coefficients, such as
degree and degree distribution.
The semantic network representation of the
word association network is constructed by repre-
senting the words as nodes and associative pairing
information for words as edges. The degree (D) of
a node denotes the number of edges that a node has.
An undirected graph is structured by the edges,
while a directed graph is structured by arcs that
include the associative direction. The numbers of
incoming and outgoing arcs from a node are re-
ferred to as the in-degree and out-degree of a node,
respectively. The sum of the in-degree and out-
degree values of a node is equal to its total degree.
This concept of graph analysis allows us to
categorize the total words in the data into three
types; one being words only found in the stimulus
set (S-type), one being words occurred as both
stimulus and responses (SR-type), and the last be-
ing words only observed among the response set
(R-type). The proportion of S-type, SR-type, and
R-type words in the total word set corresponds to
12.2% (1,568 words), 18.5% (2,374 words), and
69.3% (8,901 words) respectively. Here, it is worth
focusing on the SR-type of words. These are words
selected as the most frequent ones through a large-
scale corpus covering various fields. At the same
time, they also are produced by people in the free
association task. This may indicate, in some sense,
the high usability or commonness of those words.
Indeed, the most frequent words in this data all
belong to the SR-type.

<bodyText confidence="0.979140545454546">
Scale-free: The most frequent words belonging to
the SR-type play the role of hubs in semantic net-
works made from word association data. These
hubs can be represented as nodes that have not
only outgoing links but also possess ingoing links,
which leads us think of a scale-free graph, such as
that incorporated within the Barabási-Albert (BA)
model. It is widely known that Barabási and Albert
(1999) have suggested that the degree distributions
of scale-free network structures correspond to a
power law, expressed as P(x = d) = d (where d

stands for degree and ǫis a small integer, such as
2 or 3). This type of distribution is also known as
Zipf&apos;s law, which describes the typical frequency
distributions of words in a document and plots on a
log scale as a falling diagonal stroke. The degree
distribution of nodes in the KorWA network also
exhibits this scale-free property, which has also
been observed in word association data for differ-
ent languages.

However, we should stress the importance of
network dynamics and of microscopically examin-
ing the ongoing process of data accumulation to
determine whether the scale-freeness observed for
word association data is derived from the same
mechanism as the BA model. Rather than being
static, networks are recognized as evolving over
time, with the adding or pruning of nodes and
edges (Barabási and Albert, 1999; Watts, 1999).
Indeed, we can easily identify such networks in a
number of areas, from the World Wide Web to the
internet connections on a physical level, co-
authorships, friendships, and business transactions.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999741">

<bodyText confidence="0.999880566666667">
According to the BA model, the probability that
a node receives an additional link is proportional to
its degree. The probability that a new vertex will
be connected to a vertex (node) i depends on the
connectivity of that vertex. Barabási and Albert
(1999) explain with this idea of preferential at-
tachment in terms of the scale-free property and
the presence of hubs within the network. Networks
as dynamical systems which grow over time and
have topological properties produce dynamical
behaviors as well. In particular with research on
the diffusion of a new trend or technology or the
spread of a disease and virus, the structural proper-
ties of the network have presented a new approach
to understanding epidemical behaviors over a net-
work, including issues about why contagion occurs
in certain cases, how it spreads, and what is the
most efficient and effective way to prevent it.
Many researchers have tried to address and analyze
such behaviors with small-world models (Ball et
al., 1997; Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and scale-free
models (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001).
The semantic networks that we have examined
to date have similar structural properties to many
other networks. So, it is also possible to explain the
scale-free feature of semantic networks in terms of
preferential attachment? How can such dynamic
behavior be interpreted for semantic networks? In
the next section, we would like to briefly discuss
those questions a little further.

Network Dynamics: It is a matter of fact that lan-
guage evolves; especially from a lexical perspec-
tive, where new vocabularies are generated and old
senses sometimes disappear over time. However,
tracing and observing such changes is rather diffi-
cult because such natural language evolution oc-
curs over long periods of time. When considering
the evolution of semantic networks, therefore, we
assume that the growth of a semantic network may
correspond to the increases in the numbers of
words (nodes) and semantic relations (edges) in as
more data is added in the construction of the net-
work. Particularly, for our semantic networks
which are built from word association data, the
networks grow as more word association data is
added.
In this sense, we can attempt to observe the
growth process for semantic networks here. To that
aim, the KorWA network is particularly suitable,
as it is constructed from KorWA data collected
from two sessions that used exactly the same task.
We may see how the network evolves by taking
the sessions as two separate points in time.
From the beginning, the KorWA network starts
with the 3,951 nodes that correspond to the set of
stimulus words. It cannot be called a network at
this stage because there are no links between these
nodes. Then, as the word associations are collected,
a network starts to appear by adding edges between
the initial nodes and new nodes corresponding to
the association responses. When the first session of
data collection was complete, we found that the
initially disconnected 3,951 nodes forming a large,
well-connected network, as presented in Table 1.

<tableCaption confidence="0.984686">

<bodyText confidence="0.99960875">
The number of nodes had increased to 9,054,
and 13,669 edges were generated between them.
8,641 nodes corresponding to 95% of the total
nodes are connected to each other, being the larg-
est component in the network, but, at the same
time, there were also 126 small partitions with 2 to
3 nodes connected to each. The pseudo diameter,
the longest distance, of the largest component is 18,
which indicates that the nodes within it are well
connected to each other. In this network, a node
has three links on average and the distribution of
degrees in the network shows a power law distribu-
tion (P(k)~K- with a degree exponent y=2.42), as
in Figure 3 above.
Then, additional word associations were col-
lected for the same set of stimulus words in the
same manner as in the first session. When the new
data was added to the first network, we obtained a
larger network, as described in Table 1. The net-
work grew by 12,844 nodes and 26,931 edges.
Through this process, more than 99.7% of nodes
(12,807) became interconnected, leaving on 37
words as elements disconnected from the whole
graph. Moreover, the pseudo diameter of the larg-

Over time (as reflected in the first and second
sessions of data collection), 3,790 nodes and
13,262 edges newly appeared in the KorWA net-
work. Through this growth, the network became
much more interconnected, as clearly evidenced by
the size of the largest component and the pseudo
diameter. What is particularly salient is the number
of links that a word has through the growth process.
Interestingly, regardless of the double increase in
the connections within the network, around 60% of
the total nodes were still poorly connected, having
a degree of only 1 or 2. On the other hand, some of
nodes that already had plenty of links became
much richer, becoming linked to even more other
nodes; with the average degree for 1% of the total
nodes being over 60. Table 2 lists the top 20 words
in terms of highest degree values before and after
growth. The first four words do not change in order,
while the shifts for the other top items are not so
significant. However, for most of these items, the
degree value roughly doubled.
From these observations, we can assume that
there are some words that attract more links from
other nodes, while most of these other words have
just a few connections. This phenomenon appears
even more conspicuously through the growth proc-
ess. The scale-free nature of semantic networks
also seems to reflect a kind of preferential attach-
ment. What kinds of words always attract links
from new nodes? As suggested already, these seem
to be basic concept words, closely related to daily
life and culture, and these hubs form a kind of
bridge between several different conceptual do-
mains.
Such words contributing to the connectivity of
the network are central to the dynamic behavior of
across the networks, and are likely to be key con-
cept words for understanding a culture and for
learning language within the contexts of semantic
networks. Further study and exploration in the
structural and dynamic characteristics within se-
mantic networks may open up a new approach to
semantics, cultural studies, and language learning
from a cognitive perspective.

3 Conclusion and Further study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964909090909">
This paper has described our dataset to represent
human language in the form of a network. With
much interest in language as a communication and
thinking tool, we have sought to build a semantic
network representing lexical knowledge and the
conceptual relations between words. To that aim,
word association data is particularly suitable in
terms of its data format and its abundant and useful
content. We presented a project to collect Korean
word association norms given the high utility and
urgent need of data of this kind. We have detailed
the project from the design of free association ex-
periment to the basic analysis of the data collected.
The application of the word association data to
computational neurolinguistics is an issue for our
future work. We believe that our study could po-
tentially represent a breakthrough for this research
field. The methods of Mitchell et al. (2008), for
example, suggest to us strong connections between
neural activation data and lexical co-occurrence
information, obtained from text corpora which
plays a role of intermediating within linguistics

embodiment theory with a sensory-motor basis and
amodal theory with computational models. Ac-
cording to Mitchell et al., the techniques of natural
language processing combined with neural linguis-
tics can enable us to predict the patterns of neural
activation for word stimuli for which fMRI data
are not yet available. In short, the neural associa-
tions within firing patterns turn out to be correlated
with word associations within co-occurrence pat-
terns.
However, the similarity coefficient or the dis-
tance between any two words might be computed
not only from a set of documents but also from
graphic representations of associative concepts,
such as the one presented in this paper. If it is true
that a word can be represented not only by a three-
dimensional array of cerebral activation, but also in
terms of the lexical relatedness that is incorporated
as a linear combination of these patterns, it may
not be an overstatement to say that there might be a
structural homology between natural neural net-
works in the brain and semantic networks built
from word association norms. This kind of meta-
network perspective within cognitive science has
become all the more important because attempts to
fill the gaps in the modeling of neural pathways are
increasingly attracting wide interest. Sporns et al.
(2004), for instance, have tried to apply the con-
ceptual methods of complex networks, such as
small word-scale free, to cortical networks and to
the more dynamic, functional and effective con-
nectivity patterns that underlie human cognition.
Similarly, Stam and Reijneveld (2007) have intro-
duced a graph analysis applied to multi-channel
recordings of brain activity, by setting up vertices
at the anatomical loci within a neural circuit and
linking some that elicit high correlation patterns to
the same stimulus. Also within the experiment
paradigms used by Mitchell et al, some techniques
for constructing a network model could be effec-
tive for the distributional representation of cortical
responses handled at the same level as meaning
proximity, even though Mitchell et al. treated each
voxel (volumetric pixel value in a 3-dimensional
regular grid) independently. If such models of net-
work settings could be applied to images of neural
activation across all the voxels for a set of stimulus
nouns, it is possible to assume, by a reverse proc-
ess of parameter estimation, the existence of hid-
den semantic layers composed of unknown
semantic features. These intermediate factors could
be compared with real vocabulary data, such as
basic verbs (as in the experiment conducted by
Mitchell et al.) taking the stimulus nouns as sub-
jects or targets.
Moreover, the merits of introducing graph
analysis techniques to computational neurolinguis-
tics could possibly be found in the evolutionary
dynamics of networks, to the extent that the degree
of word nodes (or, more simply, their frequencies)
could be weighted for the neural connectivity de-
duced from fMRI responses. The data formats of
neural activation patterns could then assimilate
diachronic data to represent how a network grows
over time around the key concepts or hub words, in
accordance with the learning processes of particu-
lar individuals. Future research from this perspec-
tive could also support the high accuracy of similar
experiments regardless of distributional bias in
word frequencies. Briefly, semantic networks con-
structed from word association data could convey
the lexical co-occurrence of words within docu-
ments to a visual map of the human brain reacting
to those words.

<abstract confidence="0.997844421052631">Korean Word Associations (KorWA) were collected to build a semantic network for the Korean language. A graphic representation approach of applying coefficients to complex networks allows us to discern the semantic structures within words. A semantic network of the KorWA was found to exhibit the scalefree property in its degree distribution. The growth of the network around hub words was also confirmed through two experimental phases. As an issue for further research, we suggest that the present results may yield insights for computational neurolinguistics, as a semantic network of word association norms can bridge the gap between information about lexical co-occurrences derived from a corpora and anatomical networks as a basis for mapping out neural activations.</abstract>

This may indicate, in some sense, the high usability or commonness of those words. Indeed, the most frequent words in this data all belong to the SR-type. 2.4 Network Analysis (2) Scale-free: The most frequent words belonging to the SR-type play the role of hubs in semantic networks made from word association data. These hubs can be represented as nodes that have not only outgoing links but also possess ingoing links, which leads us think of a scale-free graph, such as that incorporated within the Barabási-Albert (BA) model. It is widely known that Barabási and Albert (1999) have suggested that the degree distributions of scale-free network structures correspond to a power law, expressed as P(x = d) = d (where d r stands for degree and ǫis a small integer, such as 2 or 3). This type of distribution is also known as Zipf&apos;s law, which describes the typical frequency distributions of words in a document and plots on a log scale as a falling diagonal stroke. The degree distribution of nodes in the KorWA network also exhibits this scale-free property, which has also been observed in word association data for different languages. Figure 3. Degree distribution on log-lo</context>

Rather than being static, networks are recognized as evolving over time, with the adding or pruning of nodes and edges (Barabási and Albert, 1999; Watts, 1999). Indeed, we can easily identify such networks in a number of areas, from the World Wide Web to the internet connections on a physical level, coauthorships, friendships, and business transactions. 31 According to the BA model, the probability that a node receives an additional link is proportional to its degree. The probability that a new vertex will be connected to a vertex (node) i depends on the connectivity of that vertex. Barabási and Albert (1999) explain with this idea of preferential attachment in terms of the scale-free property and the presence of hubs within the network. Networks as dynamical systems which grow over time and have topological properties produce dynamical behaviors as well. In particular with research on the diffusion of a new trend or technology or the spread of a disease and virus, the structural properties of the network have presented a new approach to understanding epidemical behaviors over a network, including issues about why contagion occurs in certain cases, how it spreads, and what is the most efficient an</context>

We asked the subjects to write down all the words that they 28 could think of from the presented words. This procedure is called the continuous free association task, differing from the discrete association task where the subject is asked to only write down their first response (Cramer 1968). As a means of naturally displaying continuous associations, the respondents were asked to map out their responses. That is, they drew a kind of associative map for a given word, by adding a line when they made an association and numbering the responses according to the order in which they came to mind from the stimulus word.

Deese (1962) clarified the relative frequencies of paradigmatic and syntagmatic associations among the grammatical classes of English, especially with nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in his study. He observed that the tendency towards paradigmatic or syntagmatic association varied with word class; nouns are dominantly paradigmatic, while adjectives and verbs tend to be both paradigmatic and syntagmatic. In the case of adjectives, it is a particularly interesting tendency for the association types to have a strong correlation with frequency of usage.

This demonstrates the association tendency for nouns to strongly elicit paradigmatic associations, as seen from the principal noun—noun relations, while verbs and adjectives tend to yield more syntagmatic associations, as seen from the major relations of verb—noun and adjective—noun. 2.3 Network Analysis (1) 30 Degrees: Recently, a number of studies have applied graph theory approaches in investigating linguistic knowledge resources. For instance, instead of word frequency based computations, Dorow, et al (2005) utilize graph clustering techniques as methods of detecting lexical ambiguity and of acquiring semantic classes. Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) conducted a noteworthy study that examined the structural features of three semantic networks (free association norms of Nelson et al., Roget&apos;s thesaurus, and WordNet). By calculating a range of statistical features, including the average shortest paths, diameters, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions, they observed interesting similarities between three networks in terms of their scale-free patterns of connectivity and smallworld structur</context>

Furthermore, it is possible to extract the primary responses that were given as the first response produced for each stimulus word. In doing that, it is possible to convert the continuous free association task condition to the discrete association task employed in other existing data. The primary associates for the 3,942 stimulus are 7,550 word tokens (4,197 types). The associations seem to be related to the grammatical classes of the stimulus. Ervin (1961) reports that many associations tend to have the same grammatical class as the stimulus word. Similarly, Jenkins (1954) and Saporta (1955) provide an interesting way of classifying association structures into two modes, i.e. paradigmatic associations and syntagmatic ones. In the former mode, the stimulus and response fit a common grammatical paradigm.

This kind of metanetwork perspective within cognitive science has become all the more important because attempts to fill the gaps in the modeling of neural pathways are increasingly attracting wide interest. Sporns et al. (2004), for instance, have tried to apply the conceptual methods of complex networks, such as small word-scale free, to cortical networks and to the more dynamic, functional and effective connectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. Similarly, Stam and Reijneveld (2007) have introduced a graph analysis applied to multi-channel recordings of brain activity, by setting up vertices at the anatomical loci within a neural circuit and linking some that elicit high correlation patterns to the same stimulus. Also within the experiment paradigms used by Mitchell et al, some techniques for constructing a network model could be effective for the distributional representation of cortical responses handled at the same level as meaning proximity, even though Mitchell et al. treated each voxel (volumetric pixel value in a 3-dimensional regular grid) independently.

In particular with research on the diffusion of a new trend or technology or the spread of a disease and virus, the structural properties of the network have presented a new approach to understanding epidemical behaviors over a network, including issues about why contagion occurs in certain cases, how it spreads, and what is the most efficient and effective way to prevent it. Many researchers have tried to address and analyze such behaviors with small-world models (Ball et al., 1997; Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and scale-free models (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001). The semantic networks that we have examined to date have similar structural properties to many other networks. So, it is also possible to explain the scale-free feature of semantic networks in terms of preferential attachment? How can such dynamic behavior be interpreted for semantic networks? In the next section, we would like to briefly discuss those questions a little further. 2.5 Network Analysis (3) Network Dynamics: It is a matter of fact that language evolves; especially from a lexical perspective, where new vocabularies are</context>
