The paper presents an HPSG-based an-
notation scheme for constructing a Bul-
garian treebank: BulTreeBank. It dif-
fers from other grammar-based anno-
tation schemes in having a hybrid sta-
tus with respect to the partial parsing
component and the full parsing module.
As the parsing complexity is handled
preferably by the pre-processing step,
the task of the HPSG module is maxi-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797914893617">
The paper describes an annotation scheme, which
mediates between partial analysis of sentences in
Bulgarian and their complete linguistic description
in HPSG (Head-driven Phrase Structure Gram-
mar) grammar style. This guiding scheme aims at
facilitating the initial annotation of a representa-
tive set of sentences for the construction of a gen-
eral HPSG grammar of Bulgarian within the Bul-
TreeBank Project (see (Simov, Popova and Osen-
ova, 2002; Simov et al., 2002)).
The best practices in treebank-design have been
facing several problems: the degree of compro-
mise between the linguistic requirements, on one
hand, and the implementation possibilities, on the
other (Stegmann, Telljohann and Hinrichs 2000),
(Brants et al. 2003); the non-homogeneity of
linguistic approaches. Some treebank annotation
schemes aim at theory-independent interpretation,
such as the Spanish Treebank (Torruella and An-
tonin 2002), the French Treebank (Abeille et al.
2003). Other rely on specific theoretical back-
ground, such as the HPSG-oriented Polish Tree-
bank (Marciniak et al. 2003), the Dependency-
based Czech Treebank (Bohmova et al. 2003), the
Redwoods HPSG Treebank (Oepen et. al. 2002).
As the BulTreeBank is theory-dependent, our
priority is not only an easy transformation to other
linguistic theories, but maximal respect of linguis-
tic motivation when treating language phenomena.
Thus, we are dealing with the following issues:
availability of the lexical resources; theory con-
formance: especially important is the focus on
language specific parameterizations with respect
to the sort hierarchy, principles and lexicon; ade-
quate implementation. Our general design criteria
are as follows: (1) Maximal consistency between
structural mark-up and linguistic theory specifica-
tions; (2) Flexibility with respect to information
complexity; (3) Optimal linguistic integrity.
The structure of the paper is as follows: the next
section presents the goals and the architecture of
the annotation. Section 3 focuses on the HPSG
language model and processing in BulTreeBank.
Section 4 considers the concrete language parame-
ters of the annotation scheme. Section 5 describes
its XML representation. The last section outlines
the conclusions.

purpose we organized the language data into sev-
eral levels: Text corpus. It is envisaged to reach
100 mm. token-size. At the moment it comprises
about 70 mm. morphologically processed tokens,
out of which 1 mm n tokens are manually disam-
biguated. The availability of a large corpus is very
important, because it is a source for real-text ex-
amples. Treebank. It is envisaged to reach 1 mln.
token-size. Analyses are supposed to be deeper
that in the corpus. For this level we rely heavily
on successfully pre-processed data as an input to
the HPSG grammar and then - on semi-automatic
post-editing stage. The treebank can serve for de-
veloping, testing and evaluating parsers for Bul-
garian. Core set of sentences. It is compiled using
two sources: Bulgarian grammar books and cor-
pus. This set is meant to cover the basic linguistic
phenomena in Bulgarian. It is manually processed
and therefore, it will have a very high degree of
reliability.
General Architecture of the Annotation. Par-
sing with a symbolic grammar is more or less
problematic as to the coverage (Dipper, 2000).
Therefore it needs the support of a very effec-
tive preprocessing module. Adopting such an ap-
proach, we move the parsing weight to the prepro-
cessing stage, with the relevant modifications, and
leave for the HPSG grammar preferably tasks of
attachment. In this way full parsing task becomes
fluent and consistent. The annotation process in-
cludes the following steps:
Partial parsing step: This step includes all the
processing before the application of the HPSG
grammar. Sentence extraction - from grammar
books and the corpus. Pre-processing. It in-
cludes the following modules: Morphosyntac-
tic tagging: defining a tagset and assigning all
possible analyses to each word. The morpho-
logical analyzer is based on (Popov, Simov and
Vidinska 1998) and it is implemented as regular
grammars in the CLaRK System ((Simov et. al.
2001)); Part-of-speech disambiguator: for each
ambiguous word the most probable part-of-speech
is predicted ((Simov and Osenova, 2001)). For the
core set of sentences it is performed manually and
for the entire corpus - automatically; Partial gram-
mars: recognition of names, numerical expres-
sions, dates, abbreviations, special tokens (Osen-
ova and Kolkovska 2002; Ivanova and Dojkoff
2002); sentence boundary determination (Ivanova
and Dojkoff 2002). Chunk parsing: the non-
recursive constituents are identified - NPs (Osen-
ova 2002), verb complex (Slavcheva 2002).
HPSG step: The output from the previous step
is encoded into an HPSG compatible representa-
tion. Then it is sent to an HPSG grammar tool,
which takes the partial sentence analyses as an in-
put and evaluates all the attachment possibilities
for them. The output is encoded as feature graphs.
Resolution step: Here the output feature graphs
from the previous step are further processed in
the following way: (1) their intersection is calcu-
lated. The intersection exists because all analyses
include the partial parsing from the first step and
the HPSG grammar tool can not delete informa-
tion from it; (2) then, on the basis of the differ-
ences, a set of constraints over the intersection is
introduced; (3) during the actual annotation step,
the annotator&apos;s task is to extend the intersection
to full analysis by adding the missing information.
The constraints determine the appropriate exten-
sions and also propagate the information, added
by the annotator, in order to minimise the number
of the incoming possibilities.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980052631579">
As it is clear from the previous section, the core set
of sentences and the treebank itself are analyzed
within HPSG-style of grammar. In this section we
first present the general language model, accepted
within HPSG, and then, how we plan to use it for
the actual creation of the treebank.
HPSG is a lexicalist linguistic theory, in which
the linguistic objects are represented via feature
structures. It includes: a linguistic ontology (sort
hierarchy) and grammar principles (constraints
over the sort hierarchy). The sort hierarchy repre-
sents the main types of linguistic objects and their
basic characteristics. The principles impose re-
strictions on the objects and thus predict the well-
formed phrases. A basic mechanism for ensur-
ing the right sharing of information among the
various parts of the linguistic objects is the co-
reference. The main linguistic object in HPSG is
of sort sign (whose subsorts are word and phrase).

It is a complex entity that is assigned two fea-
tures: PHON (string of phonemes) and SYNSEM
(syntactic and semantic characteristics). Further
within the attribute SYNSEM there are three im-
portant attributes: CATEGORY (which encodes the
syntactic information), CONTENT (which encodes
the semantic information) and CONTEXT (which
encodes the pragmatic information). The con-
stituent structure is encoded for each phrase via
the attribute DIRS. Assigning different values to
this feature, HPSG theory distinguishes between
(at least) the following type of phrases – headed-
phrase and non-headed-phrase. The first kind is
additionally divided into head-complement, head-
subject, head-adjunct, and head-filler. The current
hierarchy of phrases is presented in the following
sort hierarchy:

head-subject
head-adjunct
head-sem-adjunct
head-pragmatic-adjunct
head-filler
non-headed-phrase
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998825">
The distinction between head-sem-adjunct and
head-pragmatic-adjunct is on the basis of whether
the given adjunct modifies the semantics of the
head or its pragmatic nature only. An example
of a pragmatic adjunct are the vocative phrases in
Bulgarian (see (Osenova and Simov 2002)). The
head-filler phrases account for the cases of un-
bounded dependency. The non-headed-phrase is
used for dealing with coordination phrases.
The linearization of the constituents in HPSG
is separated from the constituent structure and in
this way the theory allows for different orders of
the same constituent structure and discontinuous
realization of the constituents. This separation en-
sures the representation of the grammatical rela-
tions within the constituent structure. The actual
realization of the head dependents is governed by
a set of immediate dominance schemata. The re-
alization of the dependents follows the sequence:
complements —&gt; subject adjuncts. The actual
number and kind of dependents is determined by
lexical elements within each phrase.
The structure of the linguistic objects in HPSG
makes its language model very appropriate for en-
coding the information in a treebank. In fact, we
could consider it as a hybrid approach to repre-
sentation of syntactic information because it rep-
resents the constituent structures and grammatical
relations at the same time. This flexibility is at the
cost of the complexity of the representation and
processing. The complexity in our view stems in
the processing of lexical signs. The usual mecha-
nisms for the treatment of different lexical alterna-
tions and analytical word form are encoded as lex-
ical rules and/or techniques like argument compo-
sition which are very complicated. In our project
the problem is even more serious because of the
following factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98447125">
• There is no appropriate lexicon which can be
used as an HPSG lexicon for Bulgarian with
wide coverage.
• The grammar has to cover wide range of
texts.
• Although the grammar will overgenerate it
has to produce all the linguistically relevant
analyses.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996284647058824">
An unfortunate fact is that we do not have re-
sources under the project in order to implement
such an HPSG grammar and lexicon. Thus we
have to minimize the complexity with other means
external to the HPSG grammar. Following our an-
notation architecture presented in the previous sec-
tion, we rely on the preprocessing steps to deal
with the idiosyncratic information about the lex-
ical items and lexicalized phrases like idioms1
Thus the input for parsing by the HPSG grammar
is not a list of phonemes as in the usual parsing
task, but a list of signs corresponding to the chunks
from the partial preprocessing. Although the pars-
ing system has only to complete the partial struc-
tures to a complete structures, the signs from the
lAlso the preprocessing step covers some of the com-
pletely compositional phrases as it was mentioned above.
</bodyText>

partial analyses have to be checked for consistency
against the HPSG grammar. This fact causes the
following problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.827040571428571">
• Some constructions that can be recognized by
the partial grammars do not have appropriate
treatment in HPSG. Such constructions are,
for example, some kinds of idioms, date ex-
pressions, parentheticals.
• The complexity of checking over the compo-
sitional phrases is still high.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942826086956">
In order to overcome this problem we encode each
sign from the partial analysis of the sentence as
a lexical sign (the sort word) with the appropriate
characteristics based on its structure in the partial
analysis. Additionally, from the partial analysis
of the sentence we delete all parenthetical expres-
sions, which are treated as pragmatic adjuncts to
the whole sentence. Then the input to the HPSG
grammar is a list of &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; instead of list of signs
of arbitrary complexity. After parsing the modi-
fied input, the substituted phrases are incorporated
back in the sentence processing. One major prob-
lem for this approach is the possible discontinuity
within some semi-idiomatic phrases. Such kind of
discontinuity is recognizable by the partial gram-
mars, but for the moment it is handled by the an-
notators.
In the next sections we present an annotation
scheme for manual annotation of the core set of
sentences. It is designed to require minimum
information from the annotators. This annota-
tion scheme reflects the model and processing de-
scribed in this section.

The classification of the linguistic phenomena that
we would like to explicate in our treebank is based
on several sources - (Marciniak et al. 2003) and
the citations there. Also we have added some
phenomena and features missing in the mentioned
sources and some specific ones for Bulgarian. Ad-
ditionally, we introduced some changes in the
classification scheme based on the HPSG defini-
tion of linguistic objects. Generally speaking, we
rely on two basic assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8427099">
1. We use a &apos;domain-phenomena&apos; cross-class-
ification, where the main syntactic domains
are defined and the phenomena, which occur
there, are analyzed.
2. We analyze the data according to the fol-
lowing HPSG-oriented criteria: the type of
the sign (word, phrase), headedness (heads
or non-heads), the typology of words and
phrases, the saturation condition (saturated
vs. non-saturated items).

4.1 Core domains of the phenomena
realizations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983757575757">
In our scheme we use the standard phrasal cate-
gories in a non-standard way. To put it more pre-
cisely, the phrasal categories are used as a macros
or an interface to more detailed and linguistically
different information. They mean more that just
constituents. Let us consider them for clarity. The
basic domains are:
NP. NPs are classified with respect to differ-
ent criteria such as the number of its internal el-
ements (heaviness), the tendency of the elements
to be closer or not to the head (we call it &apos;near-
ness&apos;), specific features (being names, numer-
ical expressions, abbreviations, pragmatic con-
structions etc), additional properties like recursiv-
ity (recursive vs. non-recursive NPs), coordina-
tion (coordinated vs. non-coordinated NPs), el-
lipsis (elliptical vs. non-elliptical NPs), substan-
tivization (substantivized vs. non-substantivized).
Note that most of the mentioned criteria interleave.
These concern mainly the automatic processing of
NPs than their HPSG analysis and thus supply in-
formation about the levels of processing.
We can assume that bare Bulgarian NPs are
always functionally complete. Hence, the noun
on its own can be considered a phrasal projec-
tion, which does not require any SPRs (speci-
fiers) on its Valency list2. Thus it is consid-
ered lexical and marked with the lexical category
N. Lexical are considered substantivized elements
as well as nouns, modified by possessive clitics
. It is in accordance with the general specifi-
cation that clitics do not change the lexical na-
ture of the sign. Other NPs are divided into the

following dependency structures: head-adjunct
(NPA), head-complement (NPC) and non-headed
(CoordP). Head-complement structure is reserved
for NN groups of type &apos;container-content&apos; and
&apos;type of assembling-entities&apos;. Head-adjunct rela-
tion covers all the other NPs and non-headed type
handles the coordinated ones.
AP. Adjective on its own or combined with a
possessive clitic is a lexical sign (A). In the latter
case the head is definite and &apos;glues&apos; the clitic. We
assume that some adjectives have complements
and the participles inherit the argument structure
of the verb. Thus we allow head-complement
(APC) and head-adjunct structures (APA). The
APA structures cover both - adjunct and subject
dependents of the underlying verb.
AdvP. If the adverb is non-modified, then it is
marked lexically (Adv). If there is a modifier, the
whole structure is considered a head-adjunct type
(AdvPA).
VP. VPs can be either lexical, or phrasal. The
lexical one is marked V and includes bare verbs,
verbs with clitics, da-constructions (inheritors of
the infinitive), analytical verb forms, elliptical
verbs. The phrasal category is recursive: first,
the verb with its full-fledged complement(s) forms
a head-complement structure (VPC). Then, the
head-complement VP takes the subject and forms
a head-subject phrase (VPS). If there are adjuncts,
they are attached last and form VPA projections.
When the extracted element does not have struc-
tural parent, we assign to it a head-filler phrase
(VPF).
Verb valency frames are automatically gener-
ated from the morphological dictionary and thus
some of them remain underspecified. As a filter
we use the machine readable valency dictionary of
Bulgarian, which specifies the relevant frame for
the verb. It covers 1000 verbs. We do not view
complementation as one-to-one relation to transi-
tivity, thus allowing VPC nodes over intransitive
verbs as well.
CL. When saturated, VP equals a sentence (S)
or a clause (CL). The sentences can be simple,
complex, coordinated. With respect to the illocu-
tionary force they are: declarative, interrogative,
imperative, optative. Different subtypes accord-
ing to the marker and/or matrix verb frame within
CL are distinguished. For example, a clause sub-
type for relatives (CLR), a clause subtype for da-
constructions (CLDA) etc.
PP. It forms a head-complement structure with
the following phrase being NP, AP or AdvP.
CoordP. It handles all types of coordinates like
NPs, PPs, APs, AdvPs, VPs. Thus, on one hand,
the exact type is recoverable compositionally from
the elements and, on the other hand, the under-
specificaton solves some problematic cases, where
the so called &apos;non-constutuent&apos; coordination ap-
pears.
XP. It covers all the cases that are not covered
by other phrases.
One important question that arises here is the
connection of the core domains with the word or-
der and inevitably - with the concept of disconti-
nuity. As it was mentioned in the introduction, we
do not accept the idea of the canonical word order
and therefore we do not change it. At this annota-
tion level we accept crossing branches in order not
to destroy the dominance relation. It means that
we first indicate the maximal constituent and then
- the place of the non-belonging elements. In our
view there exist three kinds of structural disconti-
nuity. All of them are determined by the head:
Head dependants permutation. In this case
all dependants of the head are hierarchically or-
dered in several levels of complexity and it is ac-
cepted that each level in the hierarchy is realized
continuously in the linear order. Discontinuity ap-
pears when a constituent from an upper level of
the hierarchy is realized between constituents of
a lower level. Is is labelled DiscA. A typical ex-
ample is when the subject is realized between the
verb and the complements, or the adjunct is real-
ized between the verb and the complements.
Mixture of two saturated constituents. This
is the case when the constituents of two saturated
phrases are mixed with each other. For exam-
ple, the constituents of two NPs, or two clauses.
The elements are labelled DiscM. In this case the
points of insertion of the outside constituents are
determined by the head of each saturated phrase
on the base of the uniqueness of the interpreta-
tion. The uniqueness of the interpretation means
that the outside constituents can not be interpreted
as a part of the surrounding phrase and thus can be

<bodyText confidence="0.9837878">
easily recognized as such.
External realization of an inner constituent.
This is the case referred to generally as extraction.
The element is labelled DiscE. Here we have in
mind phenomena like topicalization.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99665">
4.2 Core phenomena
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999353612903226">
In our opinion the core phenomena are not just a
list, but they can be classified into several groups
according to some specific features. Of course, we
are aware of the fact, that strict boundaries cannot
be set between the groups.
Unexpressed elements. The members of this
group depend more or less on world or grammar
knowledge, on discourse-based information.
Pro-dropness. Syntactically it is referential and
non-referential (dummy, expletive), but pragmat-
ically the types increase (Osenova (to appear)).
The pro-dropness is explicitly marked only when
it is coreferentially bound within the sentence.
Ellipsis. It is preferably a context-bound phe-
nomenon. We handle the locally recoverable el-
lipsis, being either head or dependant.
Frame alternation. It includes: passivization
and non-overt-realization of the arguments.
Co-referential relations. Here we include lan-
guage phenomena treated by the structure-sharing
(co-reference) mechanisms in HPSG.
Agreement. NP-internal agreement, Subject-
Verb agreement, doubling categories as agree-
ment markers. Idiosyncracies are handled as well
(Osenova (to appear)).
Binding. It is parameterized with respect to sub-
ject oriented binding.
Anaphora resolution of different kinds (differ-
ent from binding). When analyzing unrestricted
texts, it is very important to have information
whether the referents within the sentence are spe-
cific enough, or they need resolution. The rel-
evant status of the referent is encoded within
the feature CONTEXT INDICES. We have two
additional features: incoming-indices and out-
coming indices. When the referent is specific
enough (name), it contributes to other sentences
by outgoing-indices. When the referent is not
specifics (pronouns) and they are not co-referred
within the sentence, they are connected with the
incoming-indices.
Definiteness. On one hand, it is a morphological
feature of the nominals in the lexicon. On the other
hand, it is a phrasal feature and morphologically
can be realized only once within the phrase.
Control. Raising and equi verbs. It is important
to indicate the control verbs and patterns for a pro-
drop language like Bulgarian.
Relative clauses. They are either considered ad-
juncts within NPs or interpreted with respect to the
whole predicate.
Secondary predication. We consider it a sep-
arate kind of adjunct with co-reference specifica-
tion with the subject or object.
Type-shifting. It covers basically two phenom-
ena, in which there is type-shifting from nomi-
nal dependants to heads, or from non-nominal el-
ements to nominals.
Substantivization. It is preferably lexicon-based
and shifts the usual nominal dependants to heads.
Nominalization. It is syntactically based and
shfts predicates, intrejection etc. to nominals.

5 XML Implementation of the
Annotation Scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980125">
We have implemented the annotation scheme as
an XML DTD and a set of constraints over XML
documents in CLaRK System. The DTD defines
the general structures of the documents represent-
ing the sentence analysis; the constraints are used
in two modes (according to the general use of con-
straints in CLaRK System): (1) to support the an-
notators during their work; (2) to validate the re-
sult of the annotators&apos; work. There are two ba-
sic principles accepted during the DTD design: (1)
the XML tree model is used to represent as much
as possible from the structure of the sentence anal-
ysis; (2) the order of lexical elements corresponds
to the word order in the sentence and no empty
elements are inserted in the structure. Follow-
ing these principles, in the DTD we defined the
following elements, which correspond to the lin-
guistic domains as described above: NP, VP, AP,
and etc (for phrases) and w (for words). We call
each of these elements — structural element. Each
phrase element can have as children structural ele-
ments which define the immediate dominance re-
lation in HPSG. Additionally, the HPSG features
and their values for each structural element are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991332">
22
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749705882353">
represented in two more specific ways: (1) Sep-
aration between lexical (N, V, A etc.) and phrasal
ones (NPA, VPS, APA etc.) If there is discontinu-
ity, the corresponding elements are marked-up as
external elements (DiscA, DiscM or DiscE) and
they are additionally assigned some value of the
i dr e f attribute at the element. This value coin-
cides with the idref value of the non-immediate-
dominance element(nid) under the dominating
phrase. Then the structure-sharing relation is
stored at a suprasentential level within Co Index
tag; (2) As a set of XML attributes (the grammati-
cal characteristics of the phrase, for example).
The most important information encoded for
each structural element is the type of phrase (lexi-
cal for words). Following the HPSG sort hierarchy
we considered the following levels of description:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9888886">
• Lexical. On this level the Morpho-Syntactic
characteristics of the individual words are
represented together with their combinational
potential and semantic properties.
• Phrase. The elements represented here cor-

<bodyText confidence="0.93334175">
respond to the truly compositional elements
of syntax, semantics and pragmatics of indi-
vidual utterances in the language. They obey
the set of principles of the grammar. The hi-
erarchy of the different kinds of phrases is
given above.
Following the practical goals of the description
in the treebank and some of the latest develop-
ments in HPSG, we additionally envisage the fol-
lowing levels:
• Multi Lexical. The level is an extension of
the lexicon into two main directions. First,
here we present all the multiword lexical
forms produced by lexical rules. These in-
clude mainly analytical verb forms. The sec-
ond direction is towards representation of id-
iosyncratic expressions of different kinds —
idioms, collocations. For each kind of mul-
tiword expression a different marker for the
structural elements is defined in the DTD.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.603339666666667">
• Discourse. This is the level of the linguistic
elements bigger that a single utterance. It is
supported by the above levels. In our work
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999544">
we envisage this level to be used for a repre-
sentation of the multisentential co-reference
and anaphora resolution.
In our treebank not all of these levels will be
generated by an HPSG grammar because such a
grammar does not exist. Thus some of the levels
are treated completely by the preprocessing steps
from the above annotation architecture or as post-
processing.
Additionally to the definitions in the DTD, we
implemented a set of constraints which reflects
the possible combinations of values defined in
the DTD. For example, we encode that a struc-
tural element marked-up as a head-complement
VP (VPC) cannot immediately dominate a struc-
tural element marked-up as a head-adjunct non-
saturated VP (VPA).
The manual annotation is done within the
CLaRK System. The annotator has access to two
different views of the XML document — a tree
view and a textual view. Additional textual views
can be defined if necessary. In each view the an-
notator has the possibility to define which parts of
the XML document to be presented and in which
colour. When entering the information, the anno-
tator is supported by the constraints, stated in the
system and the DTD.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976">
The presented annotation scheme is designed to
support the building of the core set of sentences,
which will constitute not only the golden standard
for the HPSG grammar and the chunk grammars,
but will serve as a guideline for the annotators.
Because of the intended multifunctionallity of this
level, the annotation scheme combines pure lin-
guistic features with metafeatures like recursivity,
heaviness, specificity (important for chunking)
The scheme is robust and annotator-friendly, be-
cause: (1) via XML mechanisms it restricts the an-
notator in making decisions, thus reducing human-
driven errors, and (2) it minimizes the cases for
manual intervention.

This set is meant to cover the basic linguistic phenomena in Bulgarian. It is manually processed and therefore, it will have a very high degree of reliability. General Architecture of the Annotation. Parsing with a symbolic grammar is more or less problematic as to the coverage (Dipper, 2000). Therefore it needs the support of a very effective preprocessing module. Adopting such an approach, we move the parsing weight to the preprocessing stage, with the relevant modifications, and leave for the HPSG grammar preferably tasks of attachment. In this way full parsing task becomes fluent and consistent.

An example of a pragmatic adjunct are the vocative phrases in Bulgarian (see (Osenova and Simov 2002)). The head-filler phrases account for the cases of unbounded dependency. The non-headed-phrase is used for dealing with coordination phrases. The linearization of the constituents in HPSG is separated from the constituent structure and in this way the theory allows for different orders of the same constituent structure and discontinuous realization of the constituents. This separation ensures the representation of the grammatical relations within the constituent structure.

The morphological analyzer is based on (Popov, Simov and Vidinska 1998) and it is implemented as regular grammars in the CLaRK System ((Simov et. al. 2001)); Part-of-speech disambiguator: for each ambiguous word the most probable part-of-speech is predicted ((Simov and Osenova, 2001)). For the core set of sentences it is performed manually and for the entire corpus - automatically; Partial grammars: recognition of names, numerical expressions, dates, abbreviations, special tokens (Osenova and Kolkovska 2002; Ivanova and Dojkoff 2002); sentence boundary determination (Ivanova and Dojkoff 2002). Chunk parsing: the nonrecursive constituents are identified - NPs (Osenova 2002), verb complex (Slavcheva 2002). HPSG step: The output from the previous step is encoded into an HPSG compatible representation. Then it is sent to an HPSG grammar tool, which takes the partial sentence </context>

The best practices in treebank-design have been facing several problems: the degree of compromise between the linguistic requirements, on one hand, and the implementation possibilities, on the other (Stegmann, Telljohann and Hinrichs 2000), (Brants et al. 2003); the non-homogeneity of linguistic approaches. Some treebank annotation schemes aim at theory-independent interpretation, such as the Spanish Treebank (Torruella and Antonin 2002), the French Treebank (Abeille et al. 2003). Other rely on specific theoretical background, such as the HPSG-oriented Polish Treebank (Marciniak et al. 2003), the Dependencybased Czech Treebank (Bohmova et al. 2003), the Redwoods HPSG Treebank (Oepen et. al. 2002). As the BulTreeBank is theory-dependent, our priority is not only an easy transformation to other linguistic theories, but maximal respect of linguistic motivation when treating language phenomena. Thus, we are dealing with the following issues: availability of the lexical resources; theory conformance: especially important is the fo</context>
