In this paper, we propose a recursive graph
based scheme for semantic annotation of
Chinese phrases. Compared with others, this
scheme can fully differentiate those Chinese
phrases that comprise the same content
words but hold different meanings due to
their different word order or some involved
function words, and capture the hierarchical
conceptual structure of Chinese phrases,
which underlies their main semantic
information. We also give the guidelines for
annotating various commonly used types of
Chinese phrases.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937763636364">
Semantically annotated linguistic data are
important resources for natural language
processing, and have been used in many
NLP areas, e.g., parsing, word sense
disambiguation, co-reference resolution and
information extraction, etc. But due to huge
efforts needed in building them and general
difficulties in dealing with semantic
information, such resources are scarcely seen
for most languages including Chinese, if not
all.
In this paper, we focus on Chinese
phrases and present a recursive graph based
scheme for their semantic annotation.
Compared with the same task for sentences,
it only involves a relatively small data set
and simple semantic information but has
potential generality and application.
As a specific semantic annotation task,
two problems should be made clear at first.
One is at which goal the annotation is aimed.
In our case, the goal is established to be to
help disclose the correspondence between
linguistic forms and meaning, which is also
the primary goal in both traditional linguistic
research (Chomsky, 1968) and natural
language understanding (Allen, 1995).
The other problem is whether the
annotation can significantly contribute to the
established goal. In our case, the answer is of
course positive. First, the phrases themselves
are a specific kind of linguistic forms, thus
their semantic annotation directly provides
the correspondence between them and their
meanings. Second, by some kinds of analogy
rules, these annotated phrases can be
examples for deriving the correspondence
between new phrases and their meanings.
Third, as compared with western languages,
Chinese language has a specific feature that
its sentences form in roughly the same way
as its phrases (Thu, 1982), which shows that
by some kinds of combinatory rules, the
mapping between sentences and their
meanings can also be determined based on
the examples.
The remainder of this paper is organised
as the following. In section 2, we describe
the motivation of introducing recursive
graph. In section 3, we formally define what
is a recursive graph. In section 4, we specify
how commonly used types of Chinese
phrases are annotated using recursive graph.
In section 5, we give the conclusion and
discuss some future work.

In general, semantic annotation of linguistic

semantic information being represented in
some formal languages or diagrams. With
the semantic information involved varying,
the formal languages or diagrams may be
different.
One commonly used diagram for
semantic annotation of linguistic forms is
dependent tree, in which the dependence or
control relationship between constituents of
a linguistic form is depicted (Langacker,
1997). But such trees may be not powerful
enough to differentiate those Chinese
phrases that comprise the same content
words but hold different meanings due to
their word order or involved function words.
As an example, consider 1) and 2)1.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.809258833333333">
1) ft, A S
/zousi/ /qiche/

2) A S
/qiche/ /zousi/

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.8385878">
Notice 1) and 2) contain the same content
words, but hold different word order.
Regarding their meanings, 1) is an
ambiguous phrase, corresponding with two
English translation phrases as 3) and 4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.925447">
3) to smuggle cars
4) smuggled cars
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.963622333333333">
The translation phrase for 2) is 5).
5) the smuggling of cars
So, there are altogether three meanings held
by the two phrases. But the two content
words can only form two dependent trees,
listed in 6) and 7).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9922826">
1 In this paper, whenever listing a Chinese word, we
always list its Pinyin included within two symbols &apos;I&apos;,
and its English translation. For a Chinese phrase, we
furthermore list its English translation when
necessary.

<equation confidence="0.98424025">

U(/zousit, smuggle)
7) fL(/zousi/, smuggle)
A (/qiche/, car)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987498857142857">
Obviously, these two dependent trees cannot
code the three meanings listed in 3), 4) and
5). Only if we could see the same word
fL(/zousi/, smuggle) semantically
different in 1) and 2), we could add another
dependent tree 8) to code 5), with 6) and 7)
corresponding with 3) and 4) respectively.

8) 4/4&apos;(/zousi/, smuggle)2

<bodyText confidence="0.963866666666667">
But this view is quite unintuitive, and will
lead to contradictory. Consider other two
phrases 9) and 10).

car smuggle bloc
car smuggling bloc
Intuitively, the word fL,.(/zousi/, smuggle)
in 2) holds the same Meaning as the word in
10), which subsequently is equivalent with
the same word in 9). On the other hand, there
is no reason to treat the same word
(/zousi/, smuggle) semantically
differently in 1) and 9), two typical noun

three meanings 3), 4) and 5) would be
represented by the same diagram as in 13)3.
phrases. Particularly, they are both followed
by a typical noun in the two phrases.
The second problem for dependent tree to
semantically annotate linguistic forms is that
due to its tree nature, it cannot represent
multi-dependence relationship, in which one
node is controlled by several nodes. For
example, consider 11).
ii) 4* 0 A
/xihuan/ /ziji/ /de/ /ren/

the people who like oneself
Conventionally, its dependent tree should be
12).
12) A (/ren/, people)
(/xihuan/, like)
(/ziji/, self)
But intuitively, there should be some
dependence relationship between /(!ren&apos;,
people) and M E (/ziji/, self). If we add this
relationship, it will become a graph.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997285">
2.2 Conceptual Graph
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991698461538462">
Conceptual graph is another diagram for
semantic annotation of linguistic forms,
which comprises concepts and conceptual
relationship denoted by linguistic forms
(Eklund 1996). Although it is claimed to
be a directed graph in its original form, it is
equivalent to an undirected graph in nature,
with its relationship nodes and their directed
edges replaced with an undirected edge to
directly denote the relationship.
One problem with this diagram for
semantic annotation is that it cannot code the
information about head, if any, in a linguistic
form, which intuitively specifies the main
information carried by a linguistic form. This
will lead to severe problems when using the
graph to represent linguistic forms. For
A&apos;S
(/qiche/, car)
To differentiate the three meanings held
by the two phrases, we suggest using the
following two weighted graphs and one
unweighted graph, i.e., 14), 15) and 16) to
represent 3), 4) and 5) respectively.
iL
(izousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)
AS
(kousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/,
car)
AS
(/zousi/, smuggle)
(/qiche/, car)
Here we basically use undirected graphs to
annotate phrases, and introduce a rectangle
to denote the head of a linguistic phrase, if
any. Notice that we don&apos;t mark a head in 14),
which means that we don&apos;t take the verb
fi.,,(/zousi/, smuggle) as the head of the
verb phrase as usual. In general, for most
verb phrases like 14) in Chinese, they
correspond with two modifier-center phrases
like 15) and 16) that comprise the same
content words but with different meanings.
For such phrases, we generally use a
headword to differentiate between the verb
phrase and the two modifier-center phrases,
and then use different headword to
distinguish the two modifier-center phrases.
Another problem with conceptual
structure is concerned with its ability to deal
with hierarchical structures. Although nested
conceptual structure is introduced to

describe nested belief, one particular kind of
hierarchical structures (Genevieve, 1998),
some simple hierarchical structures cannot
be distinguished or annotated appropriately.
As an example, consider 17) and 18).

Using conceptual graph, we can annotate
both of them as 19), in which case the two
phrases cannot be distinguished.

<bodyText confidence="0.989376142857143">
If based on undirected graph plus head, 17)
can be annotated as 20).
But there will be no appropriate annotation
for 18), because on the one hand,
(/qichei,car) should be coded as a head
due to its relationship with MO, (/piaoliang/,
beautiful), on the other hand, it&apos;s role as the
object of the verb *LN(/zousi/, smuggle)
makes it illegal to be a head.
To differentiate 17) and 18), we further
suggest specifying the embedded structures
in linguistic forms in some way, and use
circles to denote them. In such opinion, 17)
can be annotated as 21) and 22) respectively.

In this diagram, the smaller rectangle
denotes the head of the modifier-center
phrase fL,ft,s (/zousiqiche/, smuggled
cars), the circle codes the phrase as an
embedded structure of the whole phrase,
while bigger rectangle denotes the head of
the whole phrase.
In this diagram, the circle denotes the
embedded structureiM,4, 0 A $ (/piaoliang
de qiche/, beautiful cars), while the rectangle
denotes the head of the embedded structure.
Notice the phrase on the whole is a verb
phrase, so there is no head coded here.

3. Recursive Graph
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993776">
One major concern for semantic annotation
of linguistic forms is what semantic
information will be coded, or more
generally, what is their semantic
information, which has long been a quite
controversial question. From the point of
view of concepts, linguistic forms including
phrases semantically refer to concepts, which
we think generally fall within four
categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9884885">
a) preliminary concept. For example, we
may see the word 40 (iwu/, thing)
denotes a preliminary concept.
b) compositional concept or situation,
which consists of some concepts and
their relation4. For example, phrase 1)
with the meaning 3) denotes a
situation including the concepts the
two content words, *U(/zousi/,
smuggle) and A (/qiche/, car),
denote respectively, and their
relationship, *(/shoushi/, patient).
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.793589666666667">
4 relation is also a specific kind of concepts, e.g.,
1:*(/shoushi/, patient) is a relation between
fL(/zousi/, smuggle) and S(/qiche/, car).

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.998227416666667">
c) subordinate concept or specific
concept within a situation, for
example, phrase 1) with the meaning
4) refers to the concept denoted by
S(/qichei, car) in the situation
mentioned in b).
d) subordinate feature, or specific
feature of a situation or a concept,
which generally stands for the
relationship between a situation or a
concept and another unknown
concept. Consider 23).

<bodyText confidence="0.972794789473684">
girl of appearance
the appearance of girls
In this phrase, the word mstz
(/waimao/, appearance) denotes a
feature of the concept the word MAII
(/guniang/, girl) denotes, and the
value of this feature doesn&apos;t occur in
this phrase.
Notice that the concepts within one situation
themselves may be compositional concepts,
subordinate concepts or subordinate features,
so the concepts that linguistic forms
including phrases denote generally presents a
kind of hierarchical structure. In fact, this
hierarchical structure in return represents the
main semantic information of linguistic
forms.
We introduce recursive graph as formal
diagram to represent the hierarchical
structure of linguistic forms. Let Po be the
set of preliminary points, we call pe Po a 0-
level graph. Suppose Pic_Po, E1(cP0) is the
set of the edges between points in P1,
Ri(c(P E1)) is the set of relations between
points in P1 and edges in E15, then:
i) &lt;P1, El, R1&gt; is a 1-level
compositional graph;
ii) «P1, E1, 121&gt;, p&gt; (pE121) is a 1-
level point-headed graph;
iii) E1, e&gt; (eEE1) is a 1-
level edge-headed graph;
iv) 1-level concepts comprise 1-level
compositional graphs, 1-level
point-headed graphs, and 1-level
edge-headed graphs.
Let 10=P0, 1,-1 be the set of (n-1)-level
graphs, suppose PnC(Y.ouZu,...,Z1-/),
(PnnEn_/)*AUL, En(cPn) is the set of the
edges between points in P., R.(c(P.x E.)) is
the set of relations between points in P. and
edges in En, then:
&lt;Pn, En, Rn&gt; is a n-level
compositional graph;
«P., E., R.&gt;, p&gt; (pEP.) is a n-
level point-headed graph;
«P., En, Rn&gt;, e&gt; (eEEn) is a n-
level edge-headed graph;
n-level concepts comprise n-level
compositional graphs, n-level
point-headed graphs, and n-level
edge-headed graphs.
Intuitively, 0-level graph corresponds with
preliminary points, compositional graph
corresponds with situation, point-headed
graph corresponds with subordinate concept,
and edge-headed graph corresponds with
subordinate feature.

In general, Chinese phrases can roughly be
classified into five categories, i.e., sub-
predicate, verb-object, modifier-center, verb-
complement, and coordinate. We give some
examples in the following for each category.

5 Conclusion and Future
Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999575">
In this paper, we propose a recursive graph
based scheme for semantic annotation of
Chinese phrases. This scheme can fully
differentiate those Chinese phrases that
comprise the same content words but with
different meaning due to their different word
order or some involved function words. It
can also capture the hierarchical conceptual
structures of Chinese phrases, which
determine their main semantic information.
Now, we have annotated about 5,000
Chinese phrases using this scheme. One
methodological issue is that we also choose
multi-character Chinese words as candidate
annotation phrases. The reason is that unlike
western languages, there is no clear-cut
between words and phrases in Chinese, for
most multi-character Chinese words, their
components may also be words, and the
meaning of the multi-character words tends
to be strongly related with that of their
component words. In this sense, the words
can be treated as basic phrases. More
importantly, such basic annotation examples
can be more complete in the sense of
coverage.
Future work will extend to 50,000
Chinese phrases. Another future work is to
learn the rules that determine the mapping
between linguistic forms and meanings
based on this annotation, and apply the rules
to new phrases and sentences. If this can be
successful, we can develop a semantic
analyzer for Chinese without any syntactic
analysis. In particular, we can avoid part-of-
speeches or syntactic structures that have
long been difficult notions for Chinese
languages.

As a specific semantic annotation task, two problems should be made clear at first. One is at which goal the annotation is aimed.

In section 5, we give the conclusion and discuss some future work. 2 Motivation In general, semantic annotation of linguistic forms is to associate with them their 101 semantic information being represented in some formal languages or diagrams. With the semantic information involved varying, the formal languages or diagrams may be different. One commonly used diagram for semantic annotation of linguistic forms is dependent tree, in which the dependence or control relationship between constituents of a linguistic form is depicted (Langacker, 1997). But such trees may be not powerful enough to differentiate those Chinese phrases that comprise the same content words but hold different meanings due to their word order or involved function words. As an example, consider 1) and 2)1. 1) ft, A S /zousi/ /qiche/ smuggle car 2) A S /qiche/ /zousi/ car smuggle Notice 1) and 2) contain the same content words, but hold different word order. Regarding their meanings, 1) is an ambiguous phrase, corresponding with two English translation phrases as 3) and 4). 3) to smuggle cars 4) smuggled cars The translation phrase for 2) is 5). 5) the smuggling of</context>
