Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999144272727273">
The more Chinese language materials come
out, the more we have to focus on the “same
personal name” problem. In our personal
name disambiguation system, the hierarchical
agglomerative clustering is applied, and
named entity is used as feature for document
similarity calculation. We propose a two-stage
strategy in which the first stage involves word
segmentation and named entity recognition
(NER) for feature extraction, and the second
stage focuses on clustering.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827622222222">
World Wide Web (WWW) search engines have
become widely used in recent years to retrieve
information about real-world entities such as
people. Web person search is one of the most
frequent search types on the web search engine.
As the sheer amount of web information ex-
pands at an ever more rapid pace, the named-
entity ambiguity problem becomes more and
more serious in many fields, such as information
integration, cross-document co-reference, and
question answering. It is crucial to develop me-
thodologies that can efficiently disambiguate the
ambiguous names form any given set of data.
There have been two recent Web People Search
(WePS) evaluation campaigns [1] on personal
name disambiguation using data from English
language web pages. Previous researches on
name disambiguation mainly employ clustering
algorithms which disambiguates ambiguous
names in a given document collection through
clustering them into different reference entities.
However, Chinese personal name disambigua-
tion is potentially more challenging due to the
need for word segmentation, which could intro-
duce errors that can in large part be avoided in
the English task.
There are four tasks in Chinese Language
Processing of the CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Confe-
rence, and we participate in the Chinese Personal
Name Disambiguation task. To accomplish this
task, we focused on solving two main problems
which are word segmentation and duplicate
names distinguishment. To distinguish duplicate
names, the system adopts named entity recogni-
tion and clustering strategy. For word segmenta-
tion and NER, we applied a sharing platform
named LTP designed by Harbin Institute of
Technology [2].This tagger identifies and labels
names of locations, organizations, people, time,
date, numbers and proper nouns in the input text.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-
troduces our feature extractions along with their
corresponding similarity matrix learning. In Sec-
tion 3, we analyze the performance of our sys-
tem. Finally, we draw some conclusions.

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989338166666667">
Our approach follows a common architecture for
named-entity disambiguation: the detection of
ambiguous objects, feature extractions and their
corresponding similarity matrix learning, and
clustering. The framework of overall processing
is shown in Figure 1.

2.1 The detection of ambiguous objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998080264705883">
Since it is common for a single document to
contain one or more mentions of the ambiguous
personal name, that is to say, the personal name
may appear several times in one document, there
is a need to define the object to be disambi-
guated. Here, we adopt the policy of “one person
per document” (all mentions of the ambiguous
personal name in one document are assumed to
refer to the same personal entity in reality) as in
[3] [4] [5]. Therefore, an object is defined as a
single entity with the ambiguous personal name
in a given document. This definition of the ob-
ject (document-level object) might be not com-
prehensive, because the mentions of the ambi-
guous personal name in a document may refer to
multiple entities, but we found that this is a rare
case (most of those cases occur in genealogy
web pages). On the other hand, the document-
level object can include much information de-
rived from that document, so that it can be
represented by features [6].
For a given ambiguous personal name, word
segmentation is applied first. Then we try to ex-
tract all mentions of the ambiguous personal
name. Take the given personal name “高军” for
example, first, the exact match of the name is
extracted. Secondly, mentions that are super-
strings of the given name like “高军田”is also
extracted . Finally , mentions that contain cha-
racter sequences but not a personal name like
“最高军事法院” is ignored.
Given this definition of an object, we define a
target entity as an entity that includes a mention
of the ambiguous personal name.

2.2 Feature extraction and similarity ma-
trix learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963533333334">
Most of the previous work ([3] [4] [5]) used to-
ken information in the given documents. In this
paper, we follow and extend their work especial-
ly for a web corpus. Furthermore, compared to a
token, a phrase contains more information for
named-entity disambiguation. Therefore, we ex-
plore both token and phrase-based information
in this paper. Finally, there are two kinds of fea-
ture vectors developed in our system, token-
based and phrase-based. The token-based feature
vector is composed of tokens, and the phrase-
based feature is composed of phrases. The two
feature vectors are combined into a unified fea-
ture vector in which tf-idf strategy is used for
similarity calculation.

2.2.1 Named Entity Features
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906">
From the results and papers of various teams
participating WePS, NEs have been shown to be
effective features in person name disambigua-
tion, so we used NEs as features in this study.
Through observation, we found that two differ-
ent individuals can be identified by their corres-
ponding NEs, especially by location, organiza-
tion name and some proper nouns. Hence, in our
study, we only extracted person, location, organ-
ization name and proper noun as feature from
the output of LTP, while time, date and numbers
are discarded. However, location and organiza-
tion name have many proper nouns related
weakly to a certain person. Therefore, terms
having high-document-frequency in training data
sets are removed from test data.

features. In the model, tf-idf is used as the
weight of the feature, which is defined in Eq. (1).

Here, wij is the weight of term (or phrase) ti in
document dj, freqij is the frequency of ti in dj,
MaxFreqij is the frequency of the term (or phrase)
whose frequency is the most in dj, N is the num-
ber of documents under one given name, and ni
is the number of documents which has term (or
phrase) ti.
In this study, the similarities based
on features described above were calculated us-
ing K-L divergence defined as Eq. (2).

P and Q denote the vector of a document respec-
tively. K-L divergence between two vectors
shows the distance of two related documents.
The smaller the value of K-L divergence of two
vectors becomes, the closer the two documents
are. In order to prevent the zero denominator, we
applied Dirichlet smoothing, i.e. , the zero ele-
ment in the vector will be replaced by 0.00001.

2.3 Clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991603773585">
Clustering is the key part for our personal name
disambiguation system. This task is viewed as an
unsupervised hard clustering problem. First, we
view the problem as unsupervised, using the dis-
tributed training data for parameter validation, to
optimally tune the parameters in the clustering
algorithm. Secondly, we observed that the ma-
jority of the input documents reference a single
individual. Hence, we view the problem as hard
clustering, assigning input document to exactly
one individual, so that the produced clusters do
not overlap.
In our system, hierarchical agglomerative clus-
tering (HAC) is used as a clustering method. It
builds up a hierarchy of groups by continuously
merging the two most similar groups. Each of
these groups starts as a single item, in this case
an individual document. In each iteration this
method calculates the distances between every
pair of groups, and the closest ones are merged
together to form a new group. The vector of the
new group is the average of the original pair.
This is repeated until there is only one group.
This process is shown in Fig. 2.
We used a threshold for selecting cluster. So it is
not necessary to determine the number of clus-
ters beforehand. We view the whole group as a
binary tree, every node which is not a leaf has
two children, left child and right child, and has a
record of the distance between the two children.
We traverse the tree from the root, if the distance
between the pair of children which form the
cluster is larger than the threshold, then move
down to check the distance of its left child, then
right child. The process will continue until the
distance between two children is less than the
threshold. When the process comes to an end, all
the leaves under the node will be considered to
be in the same cluster. The selecting process will
continue until all the leaves are assigned to a
cluster. The threshold is tuned using the distri-
buted training data.
The whole process mainly consists of two
phases, the first phase is clustering all the single
items into one group, and the second is selecting
cluster down along the tree from the root. This
strategy has a major disadvantage which is the
new node is the average of its children. Hence,
with the merger of nodes going on, the distance
between different groups becomes smaller and
smaller, which makes the boundaries between
different clusters blur. This is probably the main
reason that leads to the unsatisfactory results.

Since there is no correct answer of test data
received, we present the performance of our sys-
tem of training data. There are two results gotten
from the distributed evaluation in Table 1: one is
evaluated with B-Cubed, and the other with P_IP.
Both scores indicate that personal name disam-
biguation needs more effort.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999176">
In this report, we describe a system for the Chi-
nese Personal Name Disambiguation task, apply-
ing a two-stage clustering model. Because this is
our first time attending this kind of task, there
are many aspects not having been taken into ac-
count. Therefore, improving system performance
becomes motivation for us to work on it conti-
nuously. In future work, we’ll focus on improv-
ing the clustering algorithm and proper feature
extraction.
