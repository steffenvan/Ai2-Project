State-of-the-art machine translation techniques are
still far from producing high quality translations.
This drawback leads us to introduce an alterna-
tive approach to the translation problem that brings
human expertise into the machine translation sce-
nario. In this framework, namely Computer As-
sisted Translation (CAT), human translators inter-
act with a translation system, as an assistance tool,
that dinamically offers, a list of translations that best
completes the part of the sentence already trans-
lated. In this paper, finite state transducers are
presented as a candidate technology in the CAT
paradigm. The appropriateness of this technique
is evaluated on a printer manual corpus and re-
sults from preliminary experiments confirm that hu-
man translators would reduce to less than 25% the
amount of work to be done for the same task.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999955431818182">
State-of-the-art machine translation techniques are
still far from producing high quality translations.
This drawback leads us to introduce an alternative
approach to the translation problem that brings
human expertise into the machine translation sce-
nario. (Langlais et al., 2000) proposed this idea that
can be illustrated as follows. Initially, the human
translator is provided with a possible translation
for the sentence to be translated. Unfortunately in
most of the cases, this translation is not perfect, so
the translator amends it and asks for a translation
of the part of the sentence still to be translated
(completion). This latter interaction is repeated as
many times as needed until the final translation is
achieved.
The scenario described in the previous para-
graph, can be seen as an iterative refinement of
the translations offered by the translation system,
that without possessing the desired quality, help the
translator to increase his/her productivity. Nowa-
days, this lack of translation excellence is a common
characteristic in all machine translation systems.
Therefore, the human-machine synergy represented
by the CAT paradigm seems to be more promising
than fully-automatic translation in the near future.
The CAT paradigm has two important as-
pects: the models need to provide adequate com-
pletions and they have to do so efficiently to per-
form under usability constrains. To fulfill these two
requirements, Stochastic Finite State Transducers
(SFST) have been selected since they have proved
in the past to be able to provide adequate transla-
tions (Vidal, 1997; Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998;
Amengual et al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001;
Bangalore and Ricardi, 2001). In addition, efficient
parsing algorithms can be easily adapted in order to
provide completions.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
The following section introduces the general setting
for machine translation and finite state models. In
section 3, the search procedure for an interactive
translation is presented. Experimental results are
presented in section 4. Finally, some conclusions
and future work are explained in section 5.

by a Stochastic Finite State Transducer (Pic´o and
Casacuberta, 2001):
A Stochastic Finite-State Transducer (SFST)
is a finite-state network whose transitions are la-
beled by three items:
1. a source symbol (a word from the source lan-
guage vocabulary);
2. a target string (a sequence of words from the
target language vocabulary) and
3. a transition probability.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998884285714286">
They have been successfully applied into
many translation tasks (Vidal, 1997; Amengual et
al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001). Furthermore,
there exist efficient search algorithms like Viterbi
(Viterbi, 1967) for the best path and the Recur-
sive Enumeration Algorithm (REA) (Jim´enez and
Marzal, 1999) for the -best paths.
One possible way of inferring SFSTs is the
Grammatical Inference and Alignments for Trans-
ducer Inference (GIATI) technique (the previous
name of this technique was MGTI - Morphic-
Generator Transducer Inference) (Casacuberta et
al., 2004). Given a finite sample of string pairs, it
works in three steps:

<listItem confidence="0.997105833333333">
1. Building training strings. Each training pair
is transformed into a single string from an ex-
tended alphabet to obtain a new sample of
strings. The ”extended alphabet” contains
words or substrings from source and target sen-
tences coming from training pairs.
2. Inferring a (stochastic) regular grammar.
Typically, smoothed -gram is inferred from
the sample of strings obtained in the previous
step.

The transformation of a parallel corpus into
a corpus of single sentences is performed with the
help of statistical alignments: each word is joined
with its translation in the output sentence, creating
an “extended word”. This joining is done taking
care not to invert the order of the output words. The
third step is trivial with this arrangement. In our
experiments, the alignments are obtained using the
GIZA software (Och and Ney, 2000; Al-Onaizan et
al., 1999), which implements IBM statistical mod-
els (Brown et al., 1993).

3 Interactive search
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951214285714">
The concept of interactive search is closely related
to the CAT paradigm. This paradigm introduces the
new factor t✑ into the general machine translation
equation (Equation 1). t✑ represents a prefix in the
target language obtained as a result of the interac-
tion between the human translator and the machine
translation system.
As a side effect of this reformulation, the op-
timization defined in Equation 3 is performed over
the set of target suffixes rather than the set of com-
plete target sentences. Thence, the goal of CAT in
the finite-state transducer framework is to find a pre-
diction of the best suffix t , given a source sentence
s, a prefix of the target sentence t and a SFST :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9118215">
t t s
t t s (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999425">
A transducer can be understood as a weighted
graph in which every path is a possible source-target
sentence pair represented in a compact manner.
Given a source sentence s to be translated, this sen-
tence is initially employed to define a set of paths in
the transducer, whose sequence of source symbols
is compatible with the source sentence. Equation 3
is just defining the most probable path (target suffix
t ) among those that are compatible, having t as a
target prefix.

The search for this path (the product of the
probabilities associated with its edges is maximum)
is performed according to the Viterbi decoding over
the set of paths that were compatible with the source
sentence. The concatenation of the target symbols
of this best path will give place to the target sentence
(translation).
The solution to the search problem has been
devised in two phases. The first one copes with the
extraction of a word graph from a SFST given
a source sentence s. A word graph represents the
set of paths whose sequence of source symbols is
compatible with the source sentence s.
The second phase involves the search for the
best translation over the word graph . To be
more precise, in the present work the concept of
best translation has been extended to a set of best
translations (n-best translations). This search can be
carried out efficiently taking into account not only
the a posteriori probability of a given translation t,
but also the minimum edit cost with respect to the
target prefix. The way in which this latter criterium
is integrated in the search process will be explain in
section 3.2.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995197">
3.1 Word-graph derivation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934714285714">
A word graph represents the set of all possible trans-
lations for a given source sentence s that were em-
beded in the SFST . The derivation of the word
graph is performed by intersecting the SFST
with the source sentence s defining a subgraph in
whose paths are compatible with the source sen-
tence.
Interactive search can be simplified signif-
icantly by using this representation of the set of
target sentences, since the inclusion of edit cost
operations along with the search procedure intro-
duces some peculiarities that can be solved effi-
ciently in the word graph. An example of word
graph is shown in Figure 1.

3.2 Search for -best translations given a
prefix of the target sentence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999133346938776">
The application of this type of search is aimed at
the core of CAT. In this paradigm, given a source
sentence s, the human translator is provided with a
list of n translations, also called -best translations.
Then, the human translator will proceed to accept a
prefix of one of these -best translations as correct,
appending some rectifications to the selected prefix.
This new prefix of the target sentence t together
with the source sentence s will generate a new set
of best translations that will be again modified by
the human translator. This process is repeated as
many times as neccessary to achieve the desired fi-
nal translation.
Ideally, the task would be to find the target
suffix t that maximizes the probability a posteriori
given a prefix t of the target sentence and the in-
put sentence. In practice, however, it may happen
that t is not present in the word graph . The
solution is to use not t but a prefix t✑ that mini-
mizes the edition distance with t and is compatible
with . Therefore, the score of a target transla-
tion t t t is characterized by two functions, the
edit cost between the target prefix t and the opti-
mal prefix t✑ found in the word graph and the a
posteriori probability of t ( t t✑ ). In order
to value more significantly those translations that
were closer to the user preferences, the list of -
best translations has been prioritized using two cri-
teria: first, the minimum edit cost and then, by the a
posteriori probability.
The algorithm proposed to solve this search
problem is an adapted version of the Recursive Enu-
meration Algorithm (REA) described in (Jim´enez
and Marzal, 1999) that integrates the minimum edit
cost algorithm in the search procedure to deal with
words, introduced by the user, that are not present
in the word graph. This algorithm consists of two
parts:
Forward search that calculates the 1-best path
from the initial state to every state in the
word graph . Paths in the word graph are
weighted not only based on their a posteriori
probability, but also on their edit cost respect
to the target sentence prefix.
To this purpose, ficticious edges have been in-
serted into the word graph to represent edition
operations like insertion, substitution and dele-
tion. These edition operations have been in-
cluded in the word graph in the following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96059475">
– Insertion: An insertion edge has been
”inserted” as a loop for each state in the
word graph with unitary cost.
– Deletion: A deletion edge is ”added”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9847068">
for each arc in the word graph having
the same source and target state than its
sibling arc with unitary cost.
– Substitution: Each arc in the word graph
is treated as a substitution edge whose edit
cost is proportional to the levenshtein dis-
tance between the symbol associated with
this arc and the word prefix employed to
traverse this arc during the search. This
substitution cost is zero when the word
prefix matches the symbol in the word
graph arc.
Backward search that enumerates candidates
for the -best path along the -best path.
This recursive algorithm defines the next best
path that arrives at a given state as the next
best path that reaches plus the arc leaving
from to . If this next best path arriving at
state has not been calculated yet, then the
next best path procedure is called recursively
until a 1-best path is found or no best paths are
found.
To reduce the computational cost of the
search, the beam-search technique (Ney et al., 1992)
has been implemented. During the word graph
construction, two beam coefficients were employed
to penalize those edges leading to backoff states
over those ones arriving at normal states. Finally,
a third beam coefficient controls how far in terms of
number of edition operations a hypothesis.

5 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749565217391">
Finite-state transducers have been successfully
applied to CAT. These models can be learnt from
parallel corpora. The concept of interactive search
has been introduced in this paper along with some
efficient techniques (word graph derivation and -
best) that solve the parsing problem given a prefix
of the target sentence under real-time constraints.
The results show that the 5-best approach
clearly improves the quality of the translations, with
respect to the 1-best approximation.
The promising results achieved in the first ex-
periments provide a new field in machine transla-
tion still to be explored, in which the human ex-
pertise is combined with machine translation tech-
niques to increase productivity without sacrifying
high-quality translation.
Finally, the introduction of morpho-syntactic
information or bilingual categories in finite-state
transducers, are topics that leave an open door to
future research. As well as some improvements in
the search algorithms to reduce the computational
cost of finding a path in the word graph with the
minimum edit cost.

<abstract confidence="0.999541555555556">State-of-the-art machine translation techniques are still far from producing high quality translations. This drawback leads us to introduce an alternative approach to the translation problem that brings human expertise into the machine translation scenario. In this framework, namely Computer Assisted Translation (CAT), human translators interact with a translation system, as an assistance tool, that dinamically offers, a list of translations that best completes the part of the sentence already translated. In this paper, finite state transducers are presented as a candidate technology in the CAT paradigm. The appropriateness of this technique is evaluated on a printer manual corpus and results from preliminary experiments confirm that human translators would reduce to less than 25% the amount of work to be done for the same task.</abstract>

Therefore, the human-machine synergy represented by the CAT paradigm seems to be more promising than fully-automatic translation in the near future. The CAT paradigm has two important aspects: the models need to provide adequate completions and they have to do so efficiently to perform under usability constrains. To fulfill these two requirements, Stochastic Finite State Transducers (SFST) have been selected since they have proved in the past to be able to provide adequate translations (Vidal, 1997; Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Amengual et al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001; Bangalore and Ricardi, 2001). In addition, efficient parsing algorithms can be easily adapted in order to provide completions. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section introduces the general setting for machine translation and finite state models. In section 3, the search procedure for an interactive translation is presented.

They have been successfully applied into many translation tasks (Vidal, 1997; Amengual et al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001). Furthermore, there exist efficient search algorithms like Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) for the best path and the Recursive Enumeration Algorithm (REA) (Jim´enez and Marzal, 1999) for the -best paths. One possible way of inferring SFSTs is the Grammatical Inference and Alignments for Transducer Inference (GIATI) technique (the previous name of this technique was MGTI - MorphicGenerator Transducer Inference) (Casacuberta et al., 2004). Given a finite sample of string pairs, it works in three steps: 1. Building training strings. Each training pair is transformed into a single string from an extended alphabet to obtain a new sample of strings. The ”extended alphabet” contains words or substrings from source and target sentences coming from training pairs. 2. Inferring a (stochastic) regular grammar. Typically, smoothed -gram is inferred from the sample of strings obtained in the previous step. 3. Transforming the inferred regular grammar into a transducer.

This drawback leads us to introduce an alternative approach to the translation problem that brings human expertise into the machine translation scenario. (Langlais et al., 2000) proposed this idea that can be illustrated as follows. Initially, the human translator is provided with a possible translation for the sentence to be translated. Unfortunately in most of the cases, this translation is not perfect, so the translator amends it and asks for a translation of the part of the sentence still to be translated (completion). This latter interaction is repeated as many times as needed until the final translation is achieved. The scenario described in the previous paragraph, can be seen as an iterative refinement of the translations offered by the translation system, tha</context>

This substitution cost is zero when the word prefix matches the symbol in the word graph arc. Backward search that enumerates candidates for the -best path along the -best path. This recursive algorithm defines the next best path that arrives at a given state as the next best path that reaches plus the arc leaving from to . If this next best path arriving at state has not been calculated yet, then the next best path procedure is called recursively until a 1-best path is found or no best paths are found. To reduce the computational cost of the search, the beam-search technique (Ney et al., 1992) has been implemented. During the word graph construction, two beam coefficients were employed to penalize those edges leading to backoff states over those ones arriving at normal states. Finally, a third beam coefficient controls how far in terms of number of edition operations a hypothesis. 4 Experimental results 4.1 Corpus features The corpus employed to perform experiments was the Xerox corpus (SchlumbergerSema S.A et al., 2001).

Therefore, the human-machine synergy represented by the CAT paradigm seems to be more promising than fully-automatic translation in the near future. The CAT paradigm has two important aspects: the models need to provide adequate completions and they have to do so efficiently to perform under usability constrains. To fulfill these two requirements, Stochastic Finite State Transducers (SFST) have been selected since they have proved in the past to be able to provide adequate translations (Vidal, 1997; Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Amengual et al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001; Bangalore and Ricardi, 2001). In addition, efficient parsing algorithms can be easily adapted in order to provide completions. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section introduces the general setting for machine translation and finite state models. In section 3, the search procedure for an interactive translation is presented. Experimental results are presented in section 4. Finally, some conclusions and future work are explained in section 5. 2 Machine translation with finite-state tran</context>

The joint distribution t s can be modeled by a Stochastic Finite State Transducer (Pic´o and Casacuberta, 2001): A Stochastic Finite-State Transducer (SFST) is a finite-state network whose transitions are labeled by three items: 1. a source symbol (a word from the source language vocabulary); 2. a target string (a sequence of words from the target language vocabulary) and 3. a transition probability. They have been successfully applied into many translation tasks (Vidal, 1997; Amengual et al., 2000; Casacuberta et al., 2001). Furthermore, there exist efficient search algorithms like Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) for the best path and the Recursive Enumeration Algorithm (REA) (Jim´enez and Marzal, 1999) for the -best paths. One possible way of inferring SFSTs is the Grammatical Inference and Alignments for Transducer Inference (GIATI) technique (the previous name of this technique was MGTI - MorphicGenerator Transducer Inference) (Casacuberta et al., 2004). Given a finite sample of string pairs, it works in three steps: 1. Building training strings. Each training pair is</context>
