ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9991805">
We describe a fairly
comprehensive handling of the
syntax and semantics of
comparative constructions. The
analysis is largely based on the
theory developed by Pinkham,
but we advance arguments to
support a different handling of
phrasal comparatives - in
particular, we use direct
interpretation instead of C-
ellipsis. We .explain the reasons
for dividing comparative
sentences into different categories,
and for each category we give an
example of the corresponding
Montague semantics. The ideas
have all been implemented
within a large-scale grammar for
Swedish.

<bodyText confidence="0.996407363636364">
This paper is written with two distinct
audiences in mind. On the practical
side, we try to present a cookbook
which the natural language interface
â€¢ implementor can use if he wishes to
incorporate comparative constructions
into his system&apos;s coverage. This is, we
trust, interesting in itself; a quick
glance at Table 1 should be enough to
show that this construction is more
common than is perhaps generally
realized. Thus in addition to the
obvious more, less and as much as,
used together with an adjective, adverb
or determiner, we also include such
words as same, before and after, used
in appropriate ways. We also try to
give a usable classification of the
various kinds of constructions
generally lumped together under the
blanket heading of &amp;quot;Comparative
Ellipsis&amp;quot;.
Examples of comparatives
John is taller than Mary. Adjectival comparison

On the theoretical side, we want to
reexamine some fundamental
questions concerning the nature of the
comparative construction; we are
going to argue that our practical work
fairly strongly supports a hypothesis
that has already appeared in several
forms in the theoretical literature,
namely that &amp;quot;comparative ellipsis&amp;quot; is a
semantic rather than syntactic
phenomenon. We expand more on
this theme in section 2. In section 3 we
present our handling of clausal
comparison, which is a straightforward
implementation of Pinkham&apos;s theory.
The next two sections cover non-
clausal comparison, and constitute the
main part of the paper. In section 4 we
show how Pinkham&apos;s predicate
copying analysis can be implemented
within a Montague grammar
framework so that duplication of
material is not syntactic copying of
parts of the parse-tree but is instead a
double application of a higher level
function. We demonstrate at length
how this method can be used to handle
three different kinds of elliptic
construction, all of which present
problems for the syntactic approach. In
section 5 we describe our treatment of
the base generated phrasal
constructions from section B.2.3 of
Pinkham&apos;s thesis. (We call these
&amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; phrasal comparatives). In the
final section we summarize our
results; in particular we address
ourselves to the question of justifying
our classification of comparatives into
separate categories instead of providing
a unified interpretation.
The current paper is a shortened
version of (Rayner &amp; Banks 88) (&amp;quot;the
full paper&amp;quot;), which we will refer to
from time to time. This includes
among other things test examples and
full program listings of a logic
grammar based on the SNACK-85
implementation, which covers all
forms of comparison discussed here.

2. PREVIOUS WORK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99925132">
The traditional viewpoint has been to
explain non-clausal comparatives by
means of deletion rules; the first
detailed account based on this idea was
(Bresnan 73), which strongly
influenced most work in the area
during the following ten years.
Recently, however, other researchers
have pointed out problems with
Bresnan&apos;s approach; a very thorough
and detailed criticism appears in
(Pinkham 85)1, which has been our
main theoretical source. Pinkham
gives examples of a wide range of
constructions which are difficult or
impossible to explain in terms of
deletion phenomena, and suggests
instead an approach in which at least
some comparative constructions are
base-generated phrasal and then
interpreted using a rule which she calls
&amp;quot;distributive copying&amp;quot;. The following
example2 shows how the scheme
works in practice. Sentence la) receives
the logical form lb):

(The object of INVITED is the base
generated phrasal). After distributive
copying, this becomes lc):
Viewed in this light, we claim that our
treatment of non-clausal comparison
(which at first glance might seem
somewhat ad hoc) is in fact fairly well-
related to current tendencies in
theoretical linguistics.

This manoevre, replacing syntactic
deletion rules with interpretative
copying operations, seems to us very
powerful, and (although we formulate
it in a rather different way) is one of
the central ideas in our own treatment
of comparatives. We have in fact taken
it even further than Pinkham, who
keeps the verb deletion rule of &amp;quot;C-
ellipsis&amp;quot; to explain some comparative
constructions: in the account presented
below in section 4, we get rid of the
deletion rules completely and use only
interpretative methods.
In this context, it is interesting to look
at Levin&apos;s LFG-based work on sluicing
constructions (Levin 82). Levin
presents a variety of arguments to
support her claim that sluicing is not a
c-structure phenomenon (i.e. not
elliptic in nature), but rather
explainable at f-structure level (i.e. in
some sense related to a semantic
copying operation). The differences
between sluicing and comparative
ellipsis are sufficiently great that this
cannot in itself be said to prove
anything, but it is none the less
indicative of the way in which
linguists are thinking about these
problems.
In SNACK-85, which uses a framework
based on that in (Pereira 83), we
perform copying operations on &amp;quot;quant-
trees&amp;quot;, a level of structure which can
loosely be compared with Chomskian
logical form or LFG&apos;s f-structures.

3. CLAUSAL COMPARATIVES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993609676470588">
Most authors are agreed that the case of
clausal comparison is the simplest, and
for this reason we tackle it first; despite
this, it will be seen that there are a few
tricky points. Our analysis is heavily
based on Pinkham&apos;s, and virtually
amounts to an implementation of the
second section of her thesis; we start by
summarizing what we see as the main
ideas in her treatment.
The fundamental notion in Pinkham&apos;s
analysis is to assume that there is an
implicit element present in a
comparative clause, which is linked to
the head of the comparison&apos; in a way
similar to that in which a trace or gap
is linked to its controller. This &amp;quot;trace&amp;quot;
always contains a quantifier-like
component. (We will adopt Pinkham&apos;s
notation and symbolize this as Q). It
may consist of just the Q on its own, or
else be an implicit NP composed of the
Q together with other material from
the head of the comparison.
Pinkham argues that there are
essentially three cases; these are
exemplified in sentences 2a) - 2c). In
the first of these, just the Q is
extraposed; in the second, a Q together
with the CN books, taken from the
We endeavour throughout this paper to keep our
terminology as close as possible to that used by
Pinkham. The terms used are summarized in
Appendix 1.

head more books. If the head contains
a comparative adjective, as in 2c), then
the extra material, consisting of the
adjective and the main noun from the
head, is obligatory. For a justification,
and an explanation of several apparent
exceptions, we refer to Pinkham, p. 33 -
40.

A scheme of this kind can readily be
implemented using any of the
standard ways of handling traces. In
our system, which is based on
Extraposition Grammar (Pereira 83),
we use the &amp;quot;extraposition list&amp;quot; to move
the material from the head to the place
in the comparative dause where it is
going to appear; this corresponds to use
of the HOLD register in an ATN, or
&amp;quot;slash categories&amp;quot; in a GPSG-like
framework.
Although this method appears to work
well in practice, thre is a theoretical
problem arising from the possibility of
sentences with crossing extrapositions.

4.1 Basic ideas
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999633685714286">
Our first implementation (Banks 86)
was based on the conventional
interpretation of comparatives: all
comparatives are explicit or elliptic
forms of clausal comparatives, making
the analysis of comparison essentially a
syntactic process. In (Banks &amp; Rayner
87) we presented this in outline and
then described some problems we had
encountered, which eventually caused
us to abandon the approach. Briefly, it
turned out that the exact formulation
of the syntactic copying process was by
no means straightforward: there
appeared to be a strong parallel with
the well-known arguments against the
analogous point of view for co-
ordination constructions. (See e.g.
(Dowty et. al. 82), p. 271). As an
example, we presented sentence 3)
3) Everyone spent more money in
London than in New York.
which is problematic for a reduction
account. We suggested instead that the
sentence be thought of as being
composed of the following
components: the initial everyone, the
contrasted elements London and New
York, and the duplicated part, which
could be rendered (roughly) as is a P
such that P spent an amount of money
_ in _ where _. In a Montague-
grammar-like formalism, this can then
be given the following semantic
analysis:

The key point is that the syntactic
copying of the deletion approach has
been replaced by a semantic operation,
a double instantiation of a lambda-
bound form. The following account
summarizes how the idea is
implemented within the structure of
the SNACK-85 system.
Semantic interpretation in SNACK-85
is performed by first converting the
parse-tree to an intermediate form,
which we call (following (Pereira 83)) a
quant-tree. This is then subjected to
rewriting rules before being converted
into the final logical form. Normally,
these rewriting rules formalize so-
called scoping transformations; here,
we will also use them to describe the
interpretation of non-clausal
comparison. The basic motivation is
the same, namely to remove rules
from the grammar which lack syntactic
motivation.
We introduce four new kinds of nodes
in addition to those defined in (Pereira
83): we call these comparands,
comparative-objects, comparisons, and
comparison-placeholders. They
interact as follows.
(Stage 1) At the syntactic level, we view
the comparative object as a constituent
in its associated comparative AP; when
the parse-tree is transformed into the
quant-tree, the AP gets turned into a
comparand node, in which there is a
comparative-object subnode
representing the comparative object.
(Stage 2) Rewriting rules then move
the comparative-object out of the
compar and, leaving behind a
placeholder. This is a triple consisting
of the compared predicate (the
adjective, adverb or whatever), and
two logical variables (the &amp;quot;linking&amp;quot;
variables), which correspond to the
lambda-bound variables y and P above.
(Stage 3) The &amp;quot;raised&amp;quot; comparative-
object node is a 4-tuple. It consists of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.98837">
53
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.942756">
â€¢ The two variables y and P (and is
thus &amp;quot;linked&amp;quot; to the placeholder
through them - hence the name),
â€¢ The comparison type (more than,
less than, same as etc.)
â€¢ The quant subnode which
represents the comparand NP or
PP.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994836">
The rewriting rules move it upwards
until it finds a quant node that it can be
compared against. At the moment, the
only compatibility requirements are
that the quant node and the
comparative-object&apos;s quant subnode
not have incompatible case-markings.
This could be improved upon; one way
would be to define preference
heuristics which gave higher priority
to comparisons between quant nodes
whose variables are of similar type.
The result of merging the two nodes is
a comparison node, which is a 5-tuple
consisting of

<listItem confidence="0.996311166666667">

â€¢ The two &amp;quot;linking variables&amp;quot;, y
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97281747826087">
and?
When the quant-tree is converted into
logical form, there should thus be only
comparison nodes and placeholder
nodes left, with the placeholders
&amp;quot;below&amp;quot; the comparisons. In the final
stage, the portion of the quant-tree
under the comparison node is
duplicated twice, and the linking
variables instantiated in each copy in
the manner described above. So in the
&amp;quot;inner&amp;quot; copy, P gets instantiated to a a
form Ay:comp(y,y&apos;), where comp is the
type of comparison and y and y&apos; are the
degree variables; in the &amp;quot;outer&amp;quot; copy,?
is instantiated to the value of the inner
form.
In the next two subsections, we go
further to show how a similar analysis
can be used to assign a correct
semantics to two other kinds of
comparative construction without any
recourse to C-ellipsis.

4.2. Comparatives with &amp;quot;s-operators&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999599333333333">
In this section, we are going to
examine comparative constructions
like those in 4a), 4b) and 4c). These
have a long and honourable history in
the semantics literature; 4c) is a famous
example due to Russell.

In order to handle examples like these
â€¢ within our framework, we need a
syntactic representation which does
not involve ellipsis. Our solution is to
introduce a syntactic constituent which
we call an &amp;quot;s-operator&amp;quot;: we define this
implicitly by saying that an &amp;quot;s-
operator&amp;quot; and a sentential complement
combine to form a clause.1 Thus the
italicized portions of the sentences
above are deemed to be s-operators,
and in each of them the s-operator&apos;s
I In a categorial grammar framework like HPSG
(Pollard &amp; Sag 88), we could simply identify an s-
operator with a constituent of the form S/S-COMP.
It is fairly straightforward to define s-operators in
XG-grammar.

missing complement is viewed as a
kind of null pronoun.
Although this move may in English
seem syntactically quite unmotivated,
there are other languages where
evidence can be found to support the
claim that these pronouns really exist.
In Russian, where comparative
constructions very closely follow the
English and Swedish patterns, they can
optionally appear in the surface
structure as the pronoun D TO. The
following sentence illustrates this.

Semantically, the analysis of such
sentences is exactly parallel to that in
the preceding subsection. Comparing
4b) with 3), the &amp;quot;initial part&amp;quot; is most
people, and the &amp;quot;contrasted elements&amp;quot;

4.3. &amp;quot;Parallel&amp;quot; phrasal comparatives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993410571428571">
Comparative constructions of the type
illustrated in 5a) have been the object
of considerable controversy. The
orthodox position was that they were
&amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; constructions: 5a) would
thus be a reduced form of 5b).
5a) More women than men read
&amp;quot;House and Garden&amp;quot;.
5b) More women read &amp;quot;House and
Garden&amp;quot; than men read &amp;quot;House
and Garden&amp;quot;.
Pinkham, however, gives good reasons
for supposing that this is not the case,
and that the construction is in some
sense base generated phrasal (p.121-
123). It will presumably not come as a
revelation to hear that we agree with
this idea, though we express it in a
somewhat different way.
Our interpretation of Pinkham&apos;s
analysis recasts the more ... than...
construction as a special kind of
determiner. We introduce an extra
rule for NP formation: in addition to
the normal NP --* Det + CN, we also
have NP â€”, CompDet + CN + CN. (The
details can be found in the full paper).
This allows us as usual to give the
constituent structure without use of
ellipsis, and then to interpret it using a
suitable predicate-copying operation.
Once again we illustrate with a
Montague-style example.

It is interesting to compare our
treatment with that suggested in
(Keenan &amp; Stavi 86) (p.282-284) for
comparative adjectival constructions
like that in 6a); they argue
convincingly that these are to be
regarded as directly interpreted, rather
than as &amp;quot;reduced forms&amp;quot; of sentences
like 6b). It seems to us that their
arguments can be adapted to support
the analysis of &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; phrasals
given above; so if we were to extend
their example, we would have that 6b)
in its turn was also to be interpreted
directly, rather than considered a
reduction of 6c).

Pinkham uses constructions like these

with Pinkham that the most natural
solution is to treat bigger spanner than
the No. 4 as a closed constituent with a
semantic interpretation which does
not involve the rest of the sentence.

should be so, and we pause briefly to
examine the possible alternatives.

implying that John needs the No. 4.
This is clearly wrong; the &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; isn&apos;t
copied in any way, and in fact the scope
of any copying operation must be
limited to the phrase bigger spanner
than the No. 4. If we are absolutely
bent on using copying, it appears to us
that the only way in which it can be
done is to treat 9) as derived from 9c)
through 9b)
9b) John needs a spanner which is
bigger than the No. 4.
9c) John needs a spanner which is (big
to extent X), X such that the No. 4
is (big to extent Y), X &gt; Y.
To be honest, we can&apos;t completely
discount this approach. However, since
it makes bigger than the No. 4 into a
constituent in the intermediate 9b), we
think it simpler to interpret the phrase
structure directly, as is illustrated in
the following Montagovian analysis.

It will be apparent that bigger than the
No. 4 turns up as a constituent here
too, and thus our solution is in a sense
equivalent with the alternate one
proposed above. This is a striking
illustration of the difficulties that can
attend any efforts to make rigorous
comparisons between different
syntactic-semantic analyses of natural-

6. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984572272727273">
We have presented a method for
syntactic and semantic interpretation
of comparative sentences. This has
been done by dividing our material
into three separate groups, each of
which are treated differently:
â€¢ Clausal comparatives (section 3),
which are handled by extraposing
a constituent containing a Q,
following Pinkham&apos;s theoretical
analysis.

<page confidence="0.991082">

<listItem confidence="0.9959375">
â€¢ Phrasal comparatives (section 4),
treated by direct interpretation
using &amp;quot;predicate copying&amp;quot;.
â€¢ &amp;quot;Simple&amp;quot; phrasals (section 5),
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981769736842106">
handled by a different direct
interpretation method.
We do not claim that this classification
is the only way to explain the facts; as
we have said above, it would be
possible to rewrite simple phrasal
comparatives into directly interpreted
phrasal comparatives, and also to
rewrite directly interpreted phrasal
comparatives as clausal comparatives.
We think, however, that this
manoevre would give us nothing in
the form of real gains; even though a
unified solution might seem more
elegant, the syntactic transformations
needed are more complicated than the
use of different categories. Thus our
first argument against a unified
approach is the practical one: we need
do less work as implementors if we
adopt the classification described here.
Despite this, we suspect that many
readers (especially those more
theoretically than practically inclined)
would find it comforting to have some
direct evidence that supports our point
of view. In this connection we think
that the following data from Swedish
may be of interest.
Comparative constructions in Swedish
are virtually identical to the
corresponding ones in English. One
significant difference, however, is the
distribution of the relative pronoun
vad (&amp;quot;what&amp;quot;); this can optionally be
inserted after the comparative marker
in some constructions, as shown in 10)
and 11)1.

Given the correspondences between
clausal comparison â€¢and relative
clauses described in section 4, it is very
tempting to account for the &amp;quot;vad&amp;quot; as a
relative pronoun realizing the
normally null Q. If we are prepared to
accept this, it then appears significant
that &amp;quot;vad&amp;quot; may not be used in most
phrasal comparatives, as shown in 12)
and 13). This would seem problematic
for a transformational account, but is
quite natural if phrasal comparatives
are treated by direct interpretation;
there isn&apos;t any Q, so it can&apos;t be realized
as a &amp;quot;vad&amp;quot;.
