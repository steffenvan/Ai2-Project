Starting from descriptions of French connectives
(in particular &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot;—therefore), on the one
hand, and aspectual properties of French tenses
passé simple and imparfait on the other hand,
we study in this paper how the two interact
with respect to the expression of causality. It
turns out that their interaction is not free. Some
combinations are not acceptable, and we pro-
pose an explanation for them. These results ap-
ply straightforwardly to natural language gen-
eration: given as input two events related by
a cause relation, we can choose among vari-
ous ways of presentation (the parameters being
(i) the order, (ii) the connective, (iii) the tense)
so that we are sure to express a cause relation,
without generating either an incorrect discourse
or an ambiguous one.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.993341714285715">
The work reported in this paper aims at deter-
mining which constraints hold on the interac-
tion between the expression of causality (with
or without connective) and aspectual properties
of the eventualities and of the tenses used to ex-
press them. As a matter of fact, it turns out
that, at least in French, the choice of one of the
two tenses passe simple (Ps) or imparfait (IMP)
is not neutral with respect to the expression of
causality, in particular realised by means of the
connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; (therefore).
It has been observed that even when con-
cerned only with temporal localisation, it is not
enough to characterize tenses if one do not take
into account the effects of discourse relations be-
tween eventualities&apos;: (la-b) (Molendijk, 1996);
it has also been observed that the use of the

states or processes, as is traditional since (Bach, 1981).
connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; is itself subject to various ac-
ceptability constraints (lc-d) (Jayez, 1998).

Our objective in this paper is twofold: we
want to study systematically the interaction
between the various parameters we have men-
tionned, in order to provide a general expla-
nation for the acceptabilities that have been
observed, and we also want these explanations
be formulated in terms of &amp;quot;conditions of use&amp;quot;, so
that our results are exploitable for text gen-
eration. As a matter of fact, the choice of an
appropriate form to express a cause relation be-
tween events has proved a non trivial problem
(Danlos, 1987; Danlos, 1998). Two parameters
have been identified as playing an important
role: first, the order of presentation (cause be-
fore consequence, or the contrary), and second,

2 The contrast between PS and IMP is only roughly par-
allel to that between simple past and past progressive:
e.g., the translation into French of a simple past can be
either Ps or IMP. We translate systematically IMP into
past progressive, even when the glose does not have the
same aspectuo-temporal properties as the French origi-
nal. Similarly, &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot; is only roughly equivalent to
&amp;quot;donc&amp;quot;.

the presence (or absence) of a connective3. The
examples we deal with in this paper suggest that
tenses, at least in French and in particular the
choice between PS and IMP must also be taken
into account.
The assumptions we make for this work are
the following.
We assume the view on discourse adopted
within the SRDT framework (Asher, 1993): in
a coherent discourse, sentences are linked by
discourse relations, which help finding anaphor
antecedents, computing temporal localisations,
etc. Here, we are concerned only with two dis-
course relations, both involving causality. We
call the first one result, as in (Lascarides and
Asher, 1993), it holds between two sentences
when the main eventuality of the first one is the
cause of the main eventuality of the second one.
We assume here a very open notion of causal-
ity that we don&apos;t want to refine.4 We call the
other one explanation, it holds between two sen-
tences when the cause is presented after its con-
sequence, thus playing an explanation role for
the first sentence. This configuration in inter-
action with &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; has been studied in (Rossari
and Jayez, 1997) where it is called &amp;quot;causal ab-
duction&amp;quot;.
We adopt as a basis for the description of
IMP the proposal made in the DRT frame-
work (Ramp and Rohrer, 1983; Ramp and
Reyle, 1993), amended with proposals made in
French literature, in particular concerning the
anaphoric properties of this tense (Tasmowski-
De Ryck, 1985; Vet and Molendijk, 1985;
Molendijk, 1994).
At last, we adopt the description of the con-
nective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; which is elaborated, in terms of
conditions of use and semantic effects, in (Jayez
and Rossari, 1998).
We start by considering discourses where a
cause is presented after its consequence (i.e., an
explanation discourse relation should hold). We
observe that a PS-IMP sequence is sufficient to
achieve the explanation effect, but that this se-
quence is constrained by the type of causality
3(Danlos, 1988) shows the influence of many others
parameters, like the voice active vs. passive, the presence
of a relative clause, etc.

4For instance, we assume that causality holds be-
tween a branch breaking and John&apos;s falling (direct), but
also between Jean&apos;s repairing his car and his driving it
(indirect).

<bodyText confidence="0.998370727272727">
at stake. We also notice that connectives do not
seem to interfere with tenses in this case (§ 2).
We then examine discourses where the cause
is presented before the consequence. In the ab-
sence of connective, we observe that none of the
acceptable forms automatically convey causality
(§ 3.1). With the connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot;, causality
is imposed by the connective, but in its turn it
brings new constraints (§ 3.2). For each set of
examples, we provide a general explanation and
draw conclusions for text generation.

Even if a causality (the second sentence intro-
ducing the cause of the first one) is pragmati-
cally possible in all these examples, we observe
that a sequence PS-PS imposes in French a tem-
poral sequence interpretation: in all the exam-
ples (3), the main eventuality of the second sen-
tence is interpreted as temporally located after
the one of the first sentence, and this is strictly
incompatible with a causality, where cause must
precede its effect. Notice that here PS in French
behaves differently from simple past in English.5

The connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; can be used in such
configurations, without changing acceptability.
The denoted relation in this case concerns both
the epistemic level (attitudinal) and the descrip-
tive level (propositional) (Jayez and Rossari,
1998). We consider in this paper only uses
of &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; where the epistemic level does not

2.2 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999244">
We think that these acceptabilities can be ex-
plained if one takes into account two princi-
ples: one concerns causality itself in connection
with aspectuality, the other concerns the French
IMP&apos;S ability to act as an aspectual operator.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.849176">
2.2.1 Causality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9746668">
To account for the contrast between (4) and
(5), we have to be more specific about the way
causality can hold between eventualities. Let us
assume el is the cause of e2. We can distinguish
two cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956372">
1. el has to be completed to be the cause of e2.
For instance, the breaking of the branch has
to be completed before Jean can fall; Jean&apos;s
car has to be repaired before he can drive
it.
2. it is not necessary for el to be completed
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.939317111111111">
to be the cause of e2. For instance, starting
to repair the car is enough to be the cause
of one&apos;s getting dirty; driving too fast is
enough to get a fine, independantly of the
completion of el.
We call the first case accomplished causality.
Notice that this distinction is independant of the
aspectual class of the verb describing the even-
tuality. It is only a matter of world knowledge.

<footnote confidence="0.98337625">
6In this configuration, &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; (for) is the non marked
connective. Its introduction does not change notably the
acceptability jugements, we leave the examination of its
specific constraints for another study.

2.2.2 IMP as an aspectual operator
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.997336225806451">
One of the most important properties of IMP
is that it imposes an imperfective (durative,
non accomplished) view on the eventuality (Vet,
1980). The way this effect operates can be de-
scribed the following way, assuming the usual
partition of predicates into the four Vendler&apos;s
(1967) aspectual classes.
States, activities These eventualities, either
homogenious (states) or not (activities), are
non terminative, in the sense that they do
not have a natural term (end) (e.g., to know
the truth—state, to run—activity). Then
IMP is entirely compatible, thus have no
particular effect.
Achievements, accomplishments These are
characterised by the existence of a natu-
ral term. The imperfective point of view
brought by IMP imposes a change of point
of view on the term of the eventuality.
As for accomplishments, we can assume
that they can be decomposed into several
stages, according to (Moens and Steedman,
1988): first a preparatory phase, second a
culmination (or achievement) (we are not
concerned here with the result state). We
can then say that IMP refers only to the
preparatory phase, so that the term of the
eventuality loses all relevance. This ex-
plains the so-called imperfective paradox:
it is possible to use IMP even though the
eventuality never reaches its term:

He was crossing the street when the car
hit him
b. * II traversa la rue quand la voiture
l&apos;a ecrase
He crossed the street when the car
hit him
As for achievements, we can assume that
they are reduced to a culmination. Then
IMP can only be interpreted by stretching
this culmination, transforming a fundamen-
taly punctual event into a process or activ-
ity. Then there is no more natural term for
such a stretched event.

tion as soon as the eventuality has started, then
IMP does not impose further constraint, and the
sequence PS-IMP is always correct, and conveys
the appropriate causality effect. This is the case
for the examples (4, 7), where an explanation
discourse relation is infered.

On the contrary, if we have an accomplished
causality, i.e. if the cause event has to be com-
pleted to be a cause for the other event, then IMP
is never possible, for even with terminative even-
tualities (the branch breaking, fixing the car), it
has the effect of blocking the terrninativity, and
a causal interpretation is no longer possible (5).
The contrast (8) can thus be easily explained:
in (8a), we have a lexically punctual event, made
durative by the IMP. But going through a red
light has to be completed to risk a fine; in (8b),
we have an activity, and it is sufficient to have
started it to risk a fine.

2.3 Application
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911">
The consequences of the observations and the
hypotheses made earlier, when it comes to text
generation, are the following:
If one wants to present two eventualities re-
lated by a cause relation, so that the conse-
quence is presented before the cause, leading to
an explanation interpretation of the discourse,
one should obey the following principles:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9616692">
1. A PS-PS combination is not appropriate.
2. A PS-IMP combination conveys causality,
provided that we have a non accomplished
causality. Otherwise, the PS-IMP combina-
tion is not valid.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99739525">
We should note again that these constraints
are not lexical, in the sense that they do not
rely on aspectual classes, but rather on world
knowledge.

<bodyText confidence="0.998626888888889">
Let us now turn to the other mode of presenta-
tion, namely the one where cause is presented
before its consequence. We first consider cases
without connectives, and see that good accept-
abilities go along with higher ambiguity: cor-
rect example do not always convey causality
(§ 3.1). Then we consider the use of the con-
nective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot;, and observe that it changes the
acceptabilities (§ 3.2).

The first observation is that it is possible to use
a PS-PS sequence. In the absence of other dis-
course clues, such a sequence is interpreted in
French as a temporal sequence relation. Such a
temporal interpretation is compatible with, but
of course does not necessary imply, a cause re-
lation.

Changing the PS-PS sequence into a PS-IMP
changes only marginally the acceptabilities, and
the same observation as before holds: these dis-
courses do not necessarily imply causality.

For instance, (10b-c) can also be interpreted
as background discourses, where the IMP of the
second sentence is seen as introducing a back-
ground situation holding before and after the
event introduced in the first sentence. This in-
terpretation, often given as the default one for
IMP-PS sequences (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983), is
nevertheless only available when world knowl-
edge does not exclude it (10a). In any case, such
an interpretation is incompatible with a causal
interpretation.

3.1.2 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966638888889">
So it turns out that PS-IMP sequences can have
in general two interpretations: one where the
two events follow each other, and this interpre-
tation is thus compatible with a causality inter-
pretation, and another one where the eventual-
ity described by the IMP sentence overlaps with
the event given before.
This can be explained if one assumes the op-
eration of IMP as described in (Molendijk, 1994),
in a DRT framework, itself inspired by (Reichen-
bach, 1947).
One of the features of IMP is to state the
simultaneousness of the eventuality described
with some reference point (henceforth Rpt), lo-
cated in the past of the speech time. This oper-
ation can be called anaphoric, since IMP needs
some other point given by the context. This is
clearly what happens with the background ef-
fect. But it has also been shown, in particular
by Tasmowski-De Ryck (1985), that there are
some uses of IMP (called imparfait de rupture—
&amp;quot;breaking IMP&amp;quot;) which are not strictly anaphoric,
in the sense that the Rpt cannot be identified
with any previously introduced event. Rather,
it seems that such uses of IMP strongly entail the
existence of an implicit Rpt, distinct from the
events already introduced. It is also observed
that this ability of IMP to bring with it a Rpt
is constrained. In particular, there must be a
way to connect this Rpt to the other eventual-
ities of the discourse. Molendijk (1996) shows
that this connection can be a causal relation. It
has also been observed that an implicit Rpt is
always temporally located after the last event
introduced. So this is compatible with a causal-
ity interpretation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999893136363636">
From a text generation point of view, the obser-
vations we have just made cannot be easily ex-
ploited: obviously, in a Cause-Consequence con-
figuration, all the tense combinations we have
seen are not informative enough, and cannot be
used, if one wants to guarantee that the concept
of causality is conveyed by the discourse.
It is thus necessary to be more explicit, for
instance by adding a connective. This is what
we are concerned with in the next section.
So, if we leave apart the PS-PS sequence, what
we have seen so far in § 2 is that the tense com-
bination is sufficient to convey a causality rela-
tion in Consequence-Cause configurations, and
then the connectives do not impose further con-
straints and do not change what is conveyed.
The situation in this section (§ 3) is in a way
symetrical: in a Cause-Consequence configura-
tion, the tense configuration is not sufficient, so
that adding a connective is necessary. But, as
we see in the next section, there are further con-
straints on the connectives.

The clearer contrast concerns cases where the

such cases, the introduction of &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; leads sys-
tematically to bad sentences. On the contrary,
it seems that &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; is always compatible with
state and accomplishment verbs.

3.2.2 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972574074074">
We are not yet able to provide a completely elab-
orated explanation for these observations. What
we propose here is a list of possible answers, sug-
gested by more fine-grained considerations on
data.
Note however that from the previous observa-
tion we can draw the principle that we can gen-
erate sentences in a Cause-Consequence configu-
ration, with a PS-IMP sequence, and the connec-
tive &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; but the aspectual class of the verb
has to be taken into account. It leads to accept-
able sentences only with accomplishments and
states.
It is clear that aspectual classes play a role,
which is not surprising, and this is the reason
why all our example lists comprise each time
one verb from each aspectual class.
The most problematic contrast concerns the
difference between activities and accomplish-
ments. The connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; seems to work
very well with accomplishments and very bad
with activities, even though accomplishments
can be seen as composed of an activity fol-
lowed by a culmination. One possible explana-
tion could rely on the observation that the re-
sult relation brought by &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; holds not at the
propositionnal level, not even at the aspectual
(i.e., point of view on events), but rather at an
attitudinal level (Rossari and Jayez, 1997). Be-
sides, one can observe that what distinguishes
activities and accomplishments is not the na-
ture itself of the eventuality, but rather the fact
that one expects/considers the culmination of it
in one case and not in the other. So this can be
seen as a difference of (propositional) attitude
over the eventualities. We are presently working
on the elaboration of a proposal based on this
viewpoint. It is also worth observing that the
temporal interval that lies between a cause and
its consequence might play a role, as suggested
by (Jayez, 1998), especially for this contrast be-
tween activities and accomplishments.
As for achievements, we have already noted
that their compatibility with IMP is not entirely
established, for reasons coming from the punc-
tual nature of achievements. It is also worth
noting that there is an affinity between achieve-
ments and &amp;quot;imparfait de rupture&amp;quot; (Tasmowski-
De Ryck, 1985). Of course, as suggested by
its name, such use of IMP introduces a sort of
break in the discourse, which is of course com-
patible with causality, but might not be com-
patible with the way &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; operates, requiring
a strong connection between two utterances.

Summary We summarize our observations in
the table 1. We consider in this table all the
possible configurations one has when the three
following parameters vary.

1. Order of presentation: el before e2 or the
other way around (assuming el is the cause
of e2).
2. Presence of a connective &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;.7
3. Use of PS or IMP.

Among the combinations, some are always
possible (which does not mean they always con-
vey causality), some are never possible, that
is, either uninterpretable or incompatible with
causality. Some are sometimes possible, depend-
ing on various constraints as shown in this pa-
per. Notice that we mention in this table some
configurations we have not considered so far,
namely configurations with an IMP-PS sequence.
7 As we have already said, we are only concerned in
this paper with &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; and mention &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; only for the
sake of completeness.

We mention them here only for the sake of com-
pleteness, since they can never be used to ex-
press causality.
The second column of the table gives the dis-
course relation associated with each configura-
tion. In some cases, it is a cause relation, ei-
ther in one direction (result—res) or in the other
(explanation—exp). The other cases are compat-
ible with a cause relation, without conveying it,
which is noted in the table as &amp;quot;suc&amp;quot; (for tempo-
ral succession) or &amp;quot;ntr&amp;quot; (neutral—for ambiguous
cases between background or temporal succes-
sion).
Conclusion This paper shows that the inter-
action of constraints coming from tenses and
connectives is rather delicate to characterize,
even in the limited domain of the expression of
causality. It also shows, however, that it is pos-
sible to draw from the linguistic characterisation
of these enough principles to be able to generate
discourses conveying causality with good guar-
anties on the achieved effect, and control over
the influence of tenses often neglected in this
respect.
We are presently studying the treatment of
other connectives, and the extension to other
tenses.

<abstract confidence="0.999013611111111">Starting from descriptions of French connectives particular the one hand, and aspectual properties of French tenses simple the other hand, we study in this paper how the two interact with respect to the expression of causality. It turns out that their interaction is not free. Some combinations are not acceptable, and we propose an explanation for them. These results apply straightforwardly to natural language generation: given as input two events related by a cause relation, we can choose among various ways of presentation (the parameters being (i) the order, (ii) the connective, (iii) the tense) so that we are sure to express a cause relation, without generating either an incorrect discourse or an ambiguous one.</abstract>

We call the first one result, as in (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), it holds between two sentences when the main eventuality of the first one is the cause of the main eventuality of the second one.

Besides, one can observe that what distinguishes activities and accomplishments is not the nature itself of the eventuality, but rather the fact that one expects/considers the culmination of it in one case and not in the other. So this can be seen as a difference of (propositional) attitude over the eventualities. We are presently working on the elaboration of a proposal based on this viewpoint. It is also worth observing that the temporal interval that lies between a cause and its consequence might play a role, as suggested by (Jayez, 1998), especially for this contrast between activities and accomplishments. As for achievements, we have already noted that their compatibility with IMP is not entirely established, for reasons coming from the punctual nature of achievements. It is also worth noting that there is an affinity between achievements and &amp;quot;imparfait de rupture&amp;quot; (TasmowskiDe Ryck, 1985). Of course, as suggested by its name, such use of IMP introduces a sort of break in the discourse, which is of course compatible with causality, but might not be compatible with the way &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; operates, requiring a strong connection betwee</context>

This interpretation, often given as the default one for IMP-PS sequences (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983), is nevertheless only available when world knowledge does not exclude it (10a). In any case, such an interpretation is incompatible with a causal interpretation. 3.1.2 Discussion So it turns out that PS-IMP sequences can have in general two interpretations: one where the two events follow each other, and this interpretation is thus compatible with a causality interpretation, and another one where the eventuality described by the IMP sentence overlaps with the event given before.

The examples we deal with in this paper suggest that tenses, at least in French and in particular the choice between PS and IMP must also be taken into account. The assumptions we make for this work are the following. We assume the view on discourse adopted within the SRDT framework (Asher, 1993): in a coherent discourse, sentences are linked by discourse relations, which help finding anaphor antecedents, computing temporal localisations, etc. Here, we are concerned only with two discourse relations, both involving causality. We call the first one result, as in (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), it holds between two sentences when the main eventuality of the first one is the cause of the main eventuality of the second one. We assume here a very open notion of causality that we don&apos;t want to refine.4 We call the other one explanation, it holds between two sentences when the cause is presented after its consequence, thus playing an explanation role for the first sentence. This configuration in interaction with &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; has been studied in (Rossari and Jayez, 1997) where it is called &amp;quot;causal abduction&amp;quot;.

States, activities These eventualities, either homogenious (states) or not (activities), are non terminative, in the sense that they do not have a natural term (end) (e.g., to know the truth—state, to run—activity). Then IMP is entirely compatible, thus have no particular effect. Achievements, accomplishments These are characterised by the existence of a natural term. The imperfective point of view brought by IMP imposes a change of point of view on the term of the eventuality. As for accomplishments, we can assume that they can be decomposed into several stages, according to (Moens and Steedman, 1988): first a preparatory phase, second a culmination (or achievement) (we are not concerned here with the result state). We can then say that IMP refers only to the preparatory phase, so that the term of the eventuality loses all relevance. This explains the so-called imperfective paradox: it is possible to use IMP even though the eventuality never reaches its term: (6) a.

As a matter of fact, it turns out that, at least in French, the choice of one of the two tenses passe simple (Ps) or imparfait (IMP) is not neutral with respect to the expression of causality, in particular realised by means of the connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; (therefore). It has been observed that even when concerned only with temporal localisation, it is not enough to characterize tenses if one do not take into account the effects of discourse relations between eventualities&apos;: (la-b) (Molendijk, 1996); it has also been observed that the use of the &apos;We use the term eventuality to refer to either events, states or processes, as is traditional since (Bach, 1981). connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; is itself subject to various acceptability constraints (lc-d) (Jayez, 1998).

But it has also been shown, in particular by Tasmowski-De Ryck (1985), that there are some uses of IMP (called imparfait de rupture— &amp;quot;breaking IMP&amp;quot;) which are not strictly anaphoric, in the sense that the Rpt cannot be identified with any previously introduced event. Rather, it seems that such uses of IMP strongly entail the existence of an implicit Rpt, distinct from the events already introduced. It is also observed that this ability of IMP to bring with it a Rpt is constrained. In particular, there must be a way to connect this Rpt to the other eventualities of the discourse. Molendijk (1996) shows that this connection can be a causal relation. It has also been observed that an implicit Rpt is always temporally located after the last event introduced. So this is compatible with a causality interpretation. 3.1.3 Application From a text generation point of view, the observations we have just made cannot be easily exploited: obviously, in a Cause-Consequence configuration, all the tense combinations we have seen are not informative enough, and cannot be used, if one wants to guarantee that the concept of causality is conveyed by the discourse. It is thus necessary to be more explicit</context>

The most problematic contrast concerns the difference between activities and accomplishments. The connective &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; seems to work very well with accomplishments and very bad with activities, even though accomplishments can be seen as composed of an activity followed by a culmination. One possible explanation could rely on the observation that the result relation brought by &amp;quot;donc&amp;quot; holds not at the propositionnal level, not even at the aspectual (i.e., point of view on events), but rather at an attitudinal level (Rossari and Jayez, 1997). Besides, one can observe that what distinguishes activities and accomplishments is not the nature itself of the eventuality, but rather the fact that one expects/considers the culmination of it in one case and not in the other. So this can be seen as a difference of (propositional) attitude over the eventualities. We are presently working on the elaboration of a proposal based on this viewpoint. It is also worth observing that the temporal interval that lies between a cause and its consequence might play a role, as suggested by (Jayez, 1998), especially for this contrast between activities a</context>
