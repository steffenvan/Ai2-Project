In this paper we present a formalization of the center-
ing approach to modeling attentional structure in dis-
course and use it as the basis for an algorithm to track
discourse context and bind pronouns. As described
in [GJW86], the process of centering attention on en-
tities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential
transitional states of, continuing, retaining and shift-
ing. We propose an extension to these states which
handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous
pronouns. The algorithm has been implemented in
an HPSG natural language system which serves as
the interface to a database query application.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999953404255319">
In the approach to discourse structure developed in
[Sid83] and [GJW86], a discourse exhibits both global
and local coherence. On this view, a key element
of local coherence is centering, a system of rules
and constraints that govern the relationship between
what the discourse is about and some of the lin-
guistic choices made by the discourse participants,
e.g. choice of grammatical function, syntactic struc-
ture, and type of referring expression (proper noun,
definite or indefinite description, reflexive or per-
sonal pronoun, etc.). Pronominalization in partic-
ular serves to focus attention on what is being talked
about; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns
causes communication to be less fluent. For instance,
it takes longer for hearers to process a pronominal-
ized noun phrase that is not in focus than one that is,
while it takes longer to process a non-pronominalized
noun phrase that is in focus than one that is not
[G ui85].
The [G3W86] centering model is based on the fol-
lowing assumptions. A discourse segment consists of
a sequence of utterances U1, , Um. With each ut-
terance Un is associated a list of forward-looking cen-
ters, C f(Un), consisting of those discourse entities
that are directly realized or realized&apos; by linguistic ex-
pressions in the utterance. Ranking of an entity on
this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it
will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse; the
first entity on this list is the preferred center, Cp(Un).
Un actually centers, or is &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;, only one entity at
a time, the backward-looking center, Cb(Un). The
backward center is a confirmation of an entity that
has already been introduced into the discourse; more
specifically, it must be realized in the immediately
preceding utterance, Un_.1. There are several distinct
types of transitions from one utterance to the next.
The typology of transitions is based on two factors:
whether or not the center of attention, Cb, is the same
from Un_1 to Un, and whether or not this entity co-
incides with the preferred center of Un. Definitions
of these transition types appear in figure 1.
These transitions describe how utterances are
linked together in a coherent local segment of dis-
course. If a speaker has a number of propositions to
express, one very simple way to do this coherently
is to express all the propositions about a given en-
tity (continuing) before introducing a related entity

1U directly realizes c if U is an utterance (of some phrase,
not necessarily a full clause) for which c is the semantic in-

situation described by the utterance U or c is directly real-
ized by some subpart of U. Realizes is thus a generalization of
directly realizes(GJW86).

As is evident in constraint 3, ranking of the items
on the forward center list, Cf, is crucial. We rank the
items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of
the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that
is, first the subject, object, and object2, followed by
other subcategorized functions, and finally, adjuncts.
This captures the idea in [GJW86] that subjecthood
contributes strongly to the priority of an item on the
Cf list.

(retaining) and then shifting the center to this new
entity. See figure 2. Retaining may be a way to sig-
nal an intention to shift. While we do not claim that
speakers really behave in such an orderly fashion, an
algorithm that expects this kind of behavior is more
successful than those which depend solely on recency
or parallelism of grammatical function. The inter-
action of centering with global focusing mechanisms
and with other factors such as intentional structure,
semantic selectional restrictions, verb tense and as-
pect, modality, intonation and pitch accent are topics
for further research.
Note that these transitions are more specific than
focus movement as described in [Sid83]. The exten-
sion we propose makes them more specific still. Note
also that the Cb of [GJW86] corresponds roughly to
Sidner&apos;s discourse focus and the Cf to her potential
foci.
The formal system of constraints and rules for cen-
tering, as we have interpreted them from [GJW86],
are as follows. For each Un in U1, ,

We are aware that this ranking usually coincides
with surface constituent order in English. It would
be of interest to examine data from languages with
relatively freer constituent order (e.g. German) to de-
termine the influence of constituent order upon cen-
tering when the grammatical functions are held con-
stant. In addition, languages that provide an identifi-
able topic function (e.g. Japanese) suggest that topic
takes precedence over subject.

pragmatics processor. It interacts with another mod-
ule called the semantics processor, which computes
representations of intrasentential anaphoric relations,
(among other things). The semantics processor has
access to information such as the surface syntactic
structure of the utterance. It provides the pragmat-
ics processor with representations which include of a
set of reference markers. Each reference marker is
contraindexed2 with expressions with which it can-
not co-specify3. Reference markers also carry infor-
mation about agreement and grammatical function.
Each pronominal reference marker has a unique in-
dex from A1, , An and is displayed in the figures

the semantic representation of the co-specifier. For
non-pronominal reference markers the surface string

The constraints proposed by [GJW86] fail in certain
examples like the following (read with pronouns de-
stressed):
Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo.
She drives too fast.
Friedman races her on weekends.
She often beats her.
This example is characterized by its multiple am-
biguous pronouns and by the fact that the final ut-
terance achieves a shift (see figure 4). A shift is in-
evitable because of constraint 3, which states that
the Cb(Un) must equal the Cp(Un_i) (since the
Cp(U,i) is directly realized by the subject of Un,
&amp;quot;Friedman&amp;quot;). However the constraints and rules from
[GJW86] would fail to make a choice here between the
co-specification possibilities for the pronouns in Un.
Given that the transition is a shift, there seem to be
more and less coherent ways to shift. Note that the
three items being examined in order to characterize
the transition between each pair of anchor?&apos; are the

Cb of Un_1, the Cb of Un, and the Cp of U. By
[GJW86] a shift occurs whenever successive Cb&apos;s are
not the same. This definition of shifting does not
consider whether the Cb of Un and the Cp of Un are
equal. It seems that the status of the Cp of Un should
be as important in this case as it is in determining
the retaining/continuing distinction.
Therefore, we propose the following extension
which handles some additional cases containing mul-
tiple ambiguous pronouns: we have extended rule 2
so that there are two kinds of shifts. A transition
for Un is ranked more highly if Cb(Un) = CP(U);
this state we call shifting-1 and it represents a more
coherent way to shift. The preferred ranking is
continuing &gt;- retaining shifting-1 &gt;- shifting (see
figure 3). This extension enables us to successfully
bind the &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; in the final utterance of the example
in figure 4 to &amp;quot;Friedman.&amp;quot; The appendix illustrates
the application of the algorithm to figure 4.
Kameyama [Kam86] has proposed another exten-
sion to the [G3W86] theory — a property-sharing con-
straint which attempts to enforce a parallellism be-
tween entities in successive utterances. She considers
two properties: SUB/ and IDENT . With her exten-
sion, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and
non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents.
However, structural parallelism is a consequence of
our ordering the Cf list by grammatical function and
the preference for continuing over retaining. Further-
more, the constraints suggested in [GJW86] succeed
in many cases without invoking an independent struc-
tural parallelism constraint, due to the distinction
between continuing and retaining, which Kameyama
fails to consider. Her example which we reproduce in
figure 5 can also be accounted for using the contin-

1. CONSTRUCT THE PROPOSED ANCHORS for Un
(a) Create set of referring expressions (RE&apos;s).
(b) Order RE&apos;s by grammatical relation.
(c) Create set of possible forward center (Cf) lists. Expand
each element of (b) according to whether it is a pronoun
or a proper name. Expand pronouns into set with entry
for each discourse entity which matches its agreement
features and expand proper nouns into a set with an
entry for each possible referent. These expansions are
a way of encoding a disjunction of possibilities.
(d) Create list of possible backward centers (C6&apos;8). This is
taken as the entities from Cf(U,,i) plus an additional
entry of NIL to allow the possibility that we will not
find a Cb for the current utterance.
(e) Create the proposed anchors. (Cb-Cf combinations
from the cross-product of the previous two steps)
2. FILTER THE PROPOSED ANCHORS
For each anchor in our list of proposed anchors we apply the
following three filters. If it passes each filter then it is still a
possible anchor for the current utterance.
(a) Filter by contraindices. That is, if we have proposed
the same antecedent for two contraindexed pronouns
or if we have proposed an antecedent for a pronoun
which it is contraindexed with, eliminate this anchor
from consideration.
(b) Go through Cf(Un_i) keeping (in order) those which
appear in the proposed Cf list of the anchor. If the
proposed Cb of the anchor does not equal the first ele-
ment of this constructed list then eliminate this anchor.
This guarantees that the Cb will be the highest ranked
element of the Cf(Un_i) realized in the current utter-
ance. (This corresponds to constraint 3 given in section
1)
(c) If none of the entities realized as pronouns in the pro-
posed Cf list equals the proposed Cb then eliminate
this anchor. This guarantees that if any element is re-
alized as a pronoun then the Cb is realized as a pronoun.
(If there are no pronouns in the proposed Cf list then
the anchor passes this filter. This corresponds to rule
1 in section 1). This rule could be implemented as a
preference strategy rather than a strict filter.
3. CLASSIFY and RANK
(a) Classify each anchor on the list of proposed anchors by
the transitions as described in section 1 taking Un_1 to
be the previous utterance and U„ to be the one we are
currently working on.
(b) Rank each proposed anchor using the extended rank-
ing in section 2. Set Cb(U„) to the proposed Cb and
Cf(U,,) to proposed Cf of the most highly ranked an-
chor.

<bodyText confidence="0.999544514285714">
The goal of the current algorithm design was concep-
tual clarity rather than efficiency. The hope is that
the structure provided will allow easy addition of fur-
ther constraints and preferences. It would be simple
to change the control structure of the algorithm so
that it first proposed all the continuing or retaining
anchors and then the shifting ones, thus avoiding a
precomputation of all possible anchors.
[GJW86] states that a realization may contribute
more than one entity to the Cf(U). This is true
in cases when a partially specified semantic descrip-
tion is consistent with more than one interpreta-
tion. There is no need to enumerate explicitly all
the possible interpretations when constructing pos-
sible Cf(U)&apos;s6, as long as the associated semantic
theory allows partially specified interpretations. This
also holds for entities not directly realized in an ut-
terance. On our view, after referring to &amp;quot;a house&amp;quot;
in If, a reference to &amp;quot;the door&amp;quot; in Un4.1 might be
gotten via inference from the representation for &amp;quot;a
house&amp;quot; in Cf( U,,). Thus when the proposed anchors
are constructed there is no possibility of having an
infinite number of potential Cf&apos;s for an utterance of
finite length.
Another question is whether the preference order-
ing of transitions in constraint 3 should always be
the same. For some examples, particularly where
Un contains a single pronoun and Un...1 is a reten-
tion, some informants seem to have a preference for
shifting, whereas the centering algorithm chooses a
continuation (see figure 8). Many of our informants
have no strong preference as to the co-specification
of the unstressed &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in Un+4. Speakers can avoid
ambiguity by stressing a pronoun with respect to its
phonological environment. A computational system

We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns. The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application. 1 Introduction In the approach to discourse structure developed in [Sid83] and [GJW86], a discourse exhibits both global and local coherence. On this view, a key element of local coherence is centering, a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants, e.g. choice of grammatical function, syntactic structure, and type of referring expression (proper noun, definite or indefinite description, reflexive or personal pronoun, etc.). Pronominalization in particular serves to focus attention on what is being talked about; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns </context>

Cb(Un)# CP(Un) Cb(U) = Cb(U-1) Cb(Un) # Cb(Un—i) CONTINUING SHIFTING RETAINING As is evident in constraint 3, ranking of the items on the forward center list, Cf, is crucial. We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that is, first the subject, object, and object2, followed by other subcategorized functions, and finally, adjuncts. This captures the idea in [GJW86] that subjecthood contributes strongly to the priority of an item on the Cf list. Figure 1 : Transition States (retaining) and then shifting the center to this new entity. See figure 2. Retaining may be a way to signal an intention to shift. While we do not claim that speakers really behave in such an orderly fashion, an algorithm that expects this kind of behavior is more successful than those which depend solely on recency or parallelism of grammatical function. The interaction of centering with global focusing mechanisms and with other factors such as intentional structure, semantic selecti</context>

Each reference marker is contraindexed2 with expressions with which it cannot co-specify3. Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function. Each pronominal reference marker has a unique index from A1, , An and is displayed in the figures in the form [POLLARD:Al], where POLLARD is the semantic representation of the co-specifier. For non-pronominal reference markers the surface string is used as the index. Indices for indefinites are generated from X1, .. • 2 Extension The constraints proposed by [GJW86] fail in certain examples like the following (read with pronouns destressed): Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo. She drives too fast. Friedman races her on weekends. She often beats her. This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift (see figure 4). A shift is inevitable because of constraint 3, which states that the Cb(Un) must equal the Cp(Un_i) (since the Cp(U,i) is directly realized by the subject of Un, &amp;quot;Friedman&amp;quot;).

It seems that the status of the Cp of Un should be as important in this case as it is in determining the retaining/continuing distinction. Therefore, we propose the following extension which handles some additional cases containing multiple ambiguous pronouns: we have extended rule 2 so that there are two kinds of shifts.

Kameyama [Kam86] has proposed another extension to the [G3W86] theory — a property-sharing constraint which attempts to enforce a parallellism between entities in successive utterances. She considers two properties: SUB/ and IDENT . With her extension, subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents. However, structural parallelism is a consequence of our ordering the Cf list by grammatical function and the preference for continuing over retaining. Furthermore, the constraints suggested in [GJW86] succeed in many cases without invoking an independent structural parallelism constraint, due to the distinction between continuing and retaining, which Kameyama fails to consider.

The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure 2. 4 Discussion 4.1 Discussion of the algorithm The goal of the current algorithm design was conceptual clarity rather than efficiency. The hope is that the structure provided will allow easy addition of further constraints and preferences. It would be simple to change the control structure of the algorithm so that it first proposed all the continuing or retaining anchors and then the shifting ones, thus avoiding a precomputation of all possible anchors. [GJW86] states that a realization may contribute more than one entity to the Cf(U). This is true in cases when a partially specified semantic description is consistent with more than one interpretation. There is no need to enumerate explicitly all the possible interpretations when constructing possible Cf(U)&apos;s6, as long as the associated semantic theory allows partially specified interpretations. This also holds for entities not directly realized in an utterance.

Many of our informants have no strong preference as to the co-specification of the unstressed &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in Un+4.
