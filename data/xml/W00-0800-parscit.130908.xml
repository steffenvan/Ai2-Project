With an increasingly global economy and the explosive growth of the &apos;World&amp;quot; in &apos;World Wide
Web&amp;quot;, the computational linguistics community is faced as never before with the challenges and
opportunities of multi-linguality. At the same time, the community has returned with renewed
enthusiasm to problems of word meaning, especially the delineation and discrimination of word
senses. An intimate relationship between the two issues is becoming apparent — for example, in
the consideration of translation equivalence in parallel corpora, the construction of multilingual
ontologies, and the examination of senses in relation to specific natural language applications
such as machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, etc. The issue of multi-lingual
approaches to sense distinctions was also a central topic of discussion at the first SENSEVAL
conference in 1998, and is one of the areas to be covered at SENSEVAL-2 (to be held in Spring
2001).
This workshop addresses problems of word sense disambiguation and delineation of appropriate
sense distinctions, with specific emphasis on approaches that involve more than one language and
the ways in which observations about cross-linguistic equivalence affect our consideration of sense
divisions in the individual languages. More generally, we seek to foster discussion and exchanges
of insight in any area of computational linguistics where anon-monolingual approach to word sense
issues is being taken.
Many people are owed thanks for their contributions to setting up this workshop. We are especially
grateful to David Yarowslcy and the staff of the Human Language Technology Center at Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology for their work in producing these proceedings under a
very tight schedule. The SIGLEX&apos;00 Program Committee enabled us to work within a very brief
time frame, by quickly turning around reviews for the substantial number of submissions to the
conference. Finally, the Department of Computer Science at Vassar College provided administrative
and organizational support. All of them are responsible for the success of SIGLEX&apos;00.
