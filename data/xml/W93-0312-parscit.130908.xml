ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9974902">
This paper describes a sense tagging technique for the auto-
matic sense tagging of running Chinese text. The system takes as
input running Chinese text, and outputs sense disambiguated
text. Whereas previous work (Yarowsity, 1992; Gale, et al. ,
1992, 1993) relies heavily on the role of statistics, the present
system makes use of Machine Readable/Tractable Dictionaries
(Wilks, et al. , 1990; Guo, in press) and an example-based rea-
soning technique (Naga°, 1984; Sumita, et al. , 1990) to treat
novel words, compound words, and phrases found in the input
text.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.885295125">
If the 1980&apos;s were characterized by the surge of efforts on Machine Read-
able/Tractable Dictionary (MRD/MTD) research, the 1990&apos;s would be a time
of massive efforts on constructing annotated text corpora. Properly annotated
text corpora could form, at least, the bases for the following:
a. the core of commercial information systems;
b. the kernel engine of &apos;Cognitive Agents&apos;;
c. the essentials of systems vital to national security.
Sense tagging of large text corpora has been on the back-burner for too

long. The preparation of large annotated text corpora, especially those with
word sense disambiguated, has always been brushed aside for some piteous
&apos;smart&apos; approaches to prevail. However, it is just this kind of hopeless clever-
ness that handicapped the speedy growth of the language enterprise. Fortunate-
ly, more and more researchers have come to realize the importance, as well as
the necessity, of being earnest in annotating large text corpora of all major lan-
guages.
The present discussion presents a system for the automatic sense tagging of
running Chinese text — — a necessary mechanism for the construction of anno-
tated &apos;Monitor Corpora&apos; (Sinclare, 1991) that do not degrade over time. The
system takes as input running Chinese text, and outputs sense disambiguated
text. Whereas previous work (farowsky, 1992; Gale, et al. , 1992, 1993) re-
lies heavily on the role of statistics, the present system makes use of Machine
Readable/Tractable Dictionaries (Wilks, et al. , 1990; Guo, in press) and an
example-based reasoning technique (Nagao, 1984; Sumita, et al. , 1990) to
treat novel words, compound words, and phrases found in the input text. The
focus of this discussion is on the example-based reasoning technique. The exam-
ples that support the tagging operation come from the system MTD.
The sense tagging system assigns a unique number for every Chinese charac-
ters occurred in the text. In most cases, the senses tagged are word senses. This
is due to the fact that most Chinese characters are words. For example, `f7&apos;
( beat) has 26 senses. (drum) has 6 senses. The phrase &apos;rill, (beat
drums) becomes `rf_B02 i-A01&apos; after sense tagging. However, not all Chi-
nese characters are words. Sometimes they are bound morphemes. In these cas-
es, the senses tagged are the meanings of the morphemes as given in the dictio-
nary. For example, .pg- as in &apos;Ff&apos; is tagged `A01&apos; , which is the
number of &apos;Far as given in the MTD when lap is used as a prefix, i. e. . a
bound morpheme.

2. Overview of the Sense-Tagging System
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981962">
The sense-tagger under discussion represents partial results of some three
years of continued efforts on the part of Tsinghua University, Beijing. China to
build systems for the processing of general, unrestricted running Chinese texts.
The system was implemented in &apos;C&apos; and currently runs on the Sun Workstation
at the National Al Laboratory in the University.

for the sake of discussion, say MRD-1,is (Fu. 1987). It
contains about 6,000 one-syllable words, e. g. (beat), &apos;Pr (drum),
and 43.000 compound words and phrases, e.g. &apos;11,t&apos; (beating drums). Each
word has one or more word senses. For example, &apos;IT&apos; (beat) has 26 senses and
(drum) 6. Note that capital letters in the numbers tagged indicate homo-
graphs, and the Arabic numbers the sense number under the homograph. The
content of the word &apos;IT&apos; (beat) is given as following:

The second MRD. for the sake of discussion, say MRD_ 2, is the Chinese
thesaurus `E..zirW14.&apos; (Mei, 1983) with about 70,000 entries. It has a 3-1ev-
el categorization system. At Level 1, the dictionary has 12 major categories. At
Level 2, the 12 major categories split into 94 subcategories. At the lowest level,
Level 3. the dictionary has altogether 1,428 subcategories. Under the current
numbering system, the capital letter indicates major categories, the lower-case
letter subcategories, and the Arabic numbers the numbering under the two su-
perordinate categories. For example, `13p13&apos; refers to one of the categories that
the word `tt.&apos; (drum) falls into. B is a first level category, p is a second level
subcategory, 13 is the numbering of the subcategory under Bp. Partial list of the
numbering of some\categories is given as follows:

The MTD was constructed from MRD- 1. It has 43,000 annotated com-
pound words and phrases. Word phrases like &apos;ITW (beating drums) are disam-
biguated in the MTD with word sense numbers tagged to both &apos;IT&apos; (beat) arid
&apos;11A&apos; (drum). e.g. `1-T_B02 A01&apos; . The numbers tagged are based on the
numbering system as used in MRD_1. For those compounds that have compo-
nent whose meaning is not related to the resultant compound, the Arabic num-
bers in the component&apos;s tag is &apos;00&apos; (e. g. , _A00 A01, 114-_ A00
A00). Much of the work in constructing the MTD was done by machine,
but supplemented by handcoding. The following gives a partial list of the con-
tents of the MTD :

2. 2. Three-step Sense-tagging Procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96037625">
Step 1 : Segmenting the input text into words, compound words and phrases
The word segmentation module is a much simplied version of a more compli-
cated segmentation program developed at the Laboratory. It looks forward
through each sentence for maximum match of character strings as recorded in the
MTD. The tagging of most known phrases is done with the help of the MTD.
&apos;Mr would be an example in question. The involved operation is simple, i. e.
&apos;match to access&apos;. When an input segment matches an entry in the MTD, the
tagged form of the matched segment replaces the input segment in the sentence.

Step 2: Example-based sense tagging of one-syllable words
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991865857142857">
The system uses an example-based sense-tagging algorithm for the disam-
biguation of one-syllable words, which are not listed in system MTD. The detail
of the algorithm is described in Section 3.
Step 3 : Default sense tagging of untaggea&apos; one-syllable words from Step 2
A default sense number is assigned to each and every one syllable word un-
tagged from Step 2. The default sense numbers are determined on the basis of
frequency of occurrence data.

3. Example-Based Sense-Tagging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.808619904761905">
Chinese words build to form compound words. In 94. 7% of the time, the
meaning of the resultant compounds is related to the contributing meanings of the
component words (Zhang, 1986, p. 87). The compound words and phrases in
the MTD contain implicit syntactic information for purpose of example-based rea-
soning about the senses of Chinese words in context.
For example, if 4n- ga, (beat gongs and drums ) is in the input text and
the sense of &apos;n&amp;quot; (beat) cannot be determined. In order to disambiguate the
word sense of &apos;IP (beat), the system looks through the MTD for every com-
pound word and phrase beginning with ,n, (beat) and decides that the phrases
IT_ B02 a_A01&apos; (beat drums) is an appropriate example to reason about the
word &apos; (beat) as found in `1&amp;quot; OITA&apos; (beat gongs and drums). since 1A&apos;
(drums) and `53 a, (gongs and drums) are in the same lowest category
`13p13&apos; in MRD_ 2. The system then assigns the tag B02&apos; . which belongs to
IT&apos; (beat) in `1&amp;quot;_B02 _A01&apos; (beat drums), to &apos;Iv (beat) in
(beat gongs and drums).
Formally, when S, S2••• S„ represent input segments from 1 to n, W repre-
sents an untagged segment, and the immediate context of W is represented by
L2 L1 W R R2--• where L stands for &apos;Left&apos; , R stands for
&apos;Right&apos; and range equals 5, we have the following:
Si S2 &amp;quot;• S„ (a)
where Sk(k=1, --• n) is a word, compound word or phrase

<bodyText confidence="0.99016575">
where Li, Ri(i=1, ,range) is a word, compound word or phrase
In the forward reasoning process, assuming that (W R,) is a possible com-
pound word or phrase, for all entries in MTD beginning with W which is in the
form (W_ tag Item), the system computes the relatedness of the two words or
phrases (W R,) and (W_tag Item), where &apos;Item&apos; may be an annotated word,
compound word, phrase, or just a meaningless Chinese character string. The
concept distance of R, arid Item is computed to determine the relatedness of the
two compound words/phrases. Hence.

<bodyText confidence="0.958405666666667">
For every pair of (W R,) (i=1, ••• &apos;range) and (W_ tag Item) in the
MTD, the pair that has the greatest non-zero relatedness measure is determined
and the W in (b) above is substituted by the W_tag in the determined pair.
The reasoning process works similarly in both directions of W i. e. for-
ward to R,,„ and backward to When the process proceeds forward, the
system looks for entries beginning with W. On the other hand, when the process
works backwards to the left of W, the system looks for annotated entries in the
MTD ending with W.

4. Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998622888888889">
The input Chinese texts that the present system works on are news release
texts from the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency. No preprocessing of these
news release texts is required.
The performance of the present sense-tagger is encouraging. The hit rate of
correct sense tagging can run as high as 95%. The lowest hit rate ever recorded
was 70%. The appendix gives a sample text which is the output of our system.
The hit rate of correct sense tagging of this sample is 93.79%. Essentially, the
hit rate of correct sense tagging performed by the system is a function of the cov-
erage of the system MTD and MRDs.

5. Limitations and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988153066666667">
a. The system makes errors when the segmentation of the input texts is less
than correct. The performance of the current sense tagger can be improved if
more sophisticated segmentation method is adopted.
b. Although the reasoning process takes advantage of collocational informa-
tion within the phrase in which the untagged segment is a part. there is no guar-
antee that the phrase does not have multiple meanings. When such cases occur,
the result of the reasoning is subject to chance.
c. The example-based sense tagging method works quite well with content
words, but for function words it often makes faulty guesses. This is partly due
to the fact that function words are less sensitive to context. The current system
assigns a default sense number for most function words. However, for those
words which can both be a function word and a content word, the system often
makes errors. This kind of errors decreases when the system preprocesses the in-
put texts with a stochastic Chinese grammatical tagger like the one developed at
Tsinghua University (Bai, et at. 1992).

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953516">
In this paper we presented a relatively simple but effective method for the
sense tagging of running Chinese texts. The system takes advantage of the collo-
cation information within the annotated compound words or phrases in the sys-
tern MTD. Considering that annotated Chinese texts constitute very useful re-
sources for Chinese language processing, especially in generating frequency of oc-
currence/co-occurrence data, general and special purpose concordances and the
data for the derivation of a natural set of semantic primitive for the Chinese lan-
guage, the current sense-tagging system looks promising. The room for progress
is to be found in the further improvement of the system resources and the refine-
ment of the reasoning algorithm.

<abstract confidence="0.999510909090909">This paper describes a sense tagging technique for the automatic sense tagging of running Chinese text. The system takes as input running Chinese text, and outputs sense disambiguated text. Whereas previous work (Yarowsity, 1992; Gale, et al. , 1992, 1993) relies heavily on the role of statistics, the present system makes use of Machine Readable/Tractable Dictionaries (Wilks, et al. , 1990; Guo, in press) and an example-based reasoning technique (Naga°, 1984; Sumita, et al. , 1990) to treat novel words, compound words, and phrases found in the input text.</abstract>
