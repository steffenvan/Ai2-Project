This paper presents a computational model of how
conversational participants collaborate in making re-
ferring expressions. The model is based on the plan-
ning paradigm. It employs plans for constructing and
recognizing referring expressions and meta-plans for
constructing and recognizing clarifications. This al-
lows the model to account for the generation and un-
derstanding both of referring expressions and of their
clarifications in a uniform framework using a single
knowledge base.

I. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992068333333333">
In the dialogue below&apos;, person A wants to refer to some
object and have person B identify it. Person A does this
by uttering a referring expression; however, A&apos;s expression
fails to allow B to uniquely identify the object. Person B
then tries to clarify A&apos;s referring expression by expanding
it. A rejects B&apos;s clarification and replaces it, which al-
lows B to identify the referent of the refashioned referring
expression.
A: 1 See the weird creature
B: 2 In the corner?
A: 3 No, on the television
B: 4 Okay.
This paper presents a computation model of Clark
and Wilkes-Gibbs&apos;s work on how conversational partici-
pants collaborate in forming referring expressions [2]. Our
model takes the role of one of the participants, either the
participant who initiates the referring expression, the ini-
tiator, or the one who is trying to identify the referent, the
responder. It accounts for how the initiator constructs the
initial referring expressions and how she and the responder
then collaborate in clarifying the referring expression until
it is acceptable. Each step of the collaboration consists of
a clarification of the referring expression and a subsequent
understanding of the clarification.
This work is based on the planning paradigm. The
knowledge that is needed to choose the content of a refer-
ring expression is encoded in plans. This allows an agent
to use the same knowledge base for both constructing and
recognizing initial referring expressions. Furthermore, the
This example is a simplified version of [6] S.2.4a
knowledge needed to clarify a referring expression is en-
coded as plans. These are meta-plans that take an instan-
tiated plan corresponding to a referring expression as a
parameter. The meta-plans reason about the failed con-
straints or effects of the instantiated plan in order to clarify
it. These repairs can subsequently be understood by per-
forming plan recognition. This approach allows the entire
collaborative process to be expressed in a uniform frame-
work with a single knowledge base.

II. Referring as Action
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935666666667">
Plans encode a relationship between goals and the prim-
itive actions that will accomplish these goals. Hence, a
set of primitive actions is needed that is relevant in the
domain of referring expressions [1]. We use the primitive
actions s-refer and s-attr. S-refer is performed by the
initiator to signal to the responder that she is referring to
an object, and that she intends him to identify the object.
S-attr ascribes some attribute to an object, for instance
its category, color, or shape.

III. Initial Referring Expression
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701047619048">
Constructing: When an initiator wants to refer to an
object, she can do so by constructing a refer plan. This
plan consists of two steps, the action s-refer, mentioned
above, and the subplan describe. Describe, through its
subplans headnoun and modifiers, constructs a descrip-
tion of the object that is intended to allow the responder to
identify the object. Headnoun decomposes into an s-attr
action that ascribes to the object the head noun chosen by
the constraints of the plan. The modifiers plan is more
complicated. Through its constraints, it ensures that the
referring expression is believed to allow the responder to
uniquely identify the object. The modifiers plan achieves
this by decomposing into the modifier plan a variable
number of times (through recursion). Each instance of the
modifier plan constructs an individual component of the
description, such as the object&apos;s color, shape, or location
(through an s-attr action).
Recognizing: The responder, after hearing the initial
referring expression, tries to recognize the intention behind
the initiator&apos;s utterance. Starting with the set of primi-
tive actions that he observed, the responder employs plan

<bodyText confidence="0.999925052631579">
recognition to determine a plan that accounts for them.
This process will lead him to ascribe the refer plan to the
initiator, including the intention for the responder to iden-
tify the referent of the description. Plan recognition, by
analyzing the constraints and effects of the inferred plan,
lets the responder attempt to identify the referent of the
description.
There are two reasons why the responder might be
unable to identify the referent. Either the responder is
unable to find any objects that satisfy the referring ex-
pression or he is able to find more than one that satisfies
it. This situation might arise if the initiator and respon-
der have different states of knowledge or belief about the
world. For instance, in the dialogue above the responder
might think that several objects are &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;. The con-
straint or effect that was violated in the inferred plan is
noted by the plan recognizer, and this knowledge is used
to repair the plan. This approach is motivated by Pollack&apos;s
treatment of ill-formed domain plans [5].

IV. Clarifications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983924489796">
Constructing: If the responder was unsuccessful at in-
ferring the referent of the referring expression, he will plan
to inform the initiator that her referring expression was
not successful. As Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs [2] point out,
the responder will try to refashion the referring expression
in order to minimize the collaborative effort, and hence he
will prefer to replace or expand the referring expression
rather than just rejecting it or postponing the decision.
The responder has several different clarification plans
[4] at his disposal and they take as a parameter the inferred
plan corresponding to the referring expression. These
plans correspond to Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs&apos;s analysis of
the repair process. One of these plans is reject-replace.
This plan rejects the step of the inferred referring expres-
sion plan that has a constraint violation and replaces it
by a similar step but with the violated constraint relaxed
(relaxing a description is due to [3]). A second plan is
postpone-expand, which is used to further qualify a refer-
ring expression that a participant found to match several
objects. This plan is used by the responder in (2) in the
dialogue above.
Recognizing: If the responder clarifies the referring
expression, the initiator will have to infer that the respon-
der is unable to identify the referent of the expression.
Furthermore, the initiator must determine how the clarifi-
cation will affect the underlying referring expression. The
responder might have rejected or postponed his decision,
as well as proposed a correction to the underlying refer-
ring expression by replacing or expanding it. Following
Litman&apos;s work on understanding clarification subdialogues
[4], this process is achieved through plan recognition.
Continuing On: Clarification subdialogues might ex-
tend beyond the responder&apos;s clarification of the initial re-
ferring expression. For instance, in the above dialogue, af-
ter the initiator inferred the responder&apos;s clarification, she
found the resulting referring expression plan ill-formed.
Hence, she constructed a subsequent clarification—&amp;quot;No, on
the television&amp;quot;. Then, the responder had to infer this clar-
ification. In general, this process will continue until both
participants accept the referring expression. The analysis
involved with these subsequent turns of the dialogue is sim-
ilar to the analysis given in the preceding two subsections.
There may be differences between how the initiator and
responder clarify a referring expression, since the initia-
tor knows the identity of the referent. Also, there may be
differences between a clarification following the initial re-
ferring expression and one following another clarification,
since, in the latter case, the referring expression may have
already been partially accepted.

V. Belief Revision
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999525">
As was mentioned earlier, the initiator and responder
might have different states of knowledge or belief about
the world, and these differences will be a cause of clarifica-
tion subdialogues. In the process of collaborating to make
referring expressions, these differences in belief will arise in
the replacements and expansions that the two participants
propose. Hence, they will need a way of resolving their
differences in beliefs about the world if they are to both
accept the referring expression. Hence the model proposed
in this paper will need to incorporate belief revision.

VI. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984833333333">
This paper has presented a computational model of how
conversational participants collaborate in making referring
expressions. However, it is hoped that the ideas presented
in this paper are of relevance to a much larger range of
collaborative processes.
The work outlined in this paper is in progress. At
present, a computer system has been implemented in Pro-
log that can construct and recognize initial referring ex-
pressions, and that can construct clarifications. In terms
of the dialogue above, the system can model both the ini-
tiator and responder for the first line and can model the
responder for the second.
