We present a system for extraction of tem-
poral expressions from French texts. The
identification of the temporal expressions is
based on a context-scanning strategy (CSS)
which is carried out by two complemen-
tary techniques: search for regular expres-
sions and left-to-right and right-to-left local
chart-parsing. A number of semantic and
distant-dependency constraints have been
integrated to the chart-parsing procedure in
order to improve the precision of the system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997949614457831">
The identification and the interpretation of tem-
poral and aspectual information plays an impor-
tant role in text understanding. This information
is encoded in the natural languages by a wide ar-
ray of linguistic means ranging from grammatical
(morpho-syntactic) to lexical (verbs and adver-
bials) or strictly syntactic phenomena (temporal
anaphora (Webber, 1988) or argument structure
of the verb (Verkuyl, 1993)).
In this paper we present a system for identi-
fication of lexical non-verbal means of expressing
temporal information in French texts. The system
detects adverbs (e.g. yesterday), adverbial noun
phrases (e.g. three days before the marriage of his
youngest son) and adverbial expressions (e.g. at
10 o&apos;clock), regardless of their number and com-
plexity. Unlike some other approaches in temporal
annotation (Ferro et al., 2001), this system iden-
tifies exclusively temporal expressions answering
when-questions. Hence, the system will flag ex-
pressions which specify the time of occurrence of
the situations (e.g. John received the letter on May
10th) and will skip those modifying lexical units
(e.g. John received her letter of May 10th).
The identification of the temporal expressions is
based on a context-scanning strategy (CSS) (De-
scles, 1997) which is carried out by two comple-
mentary techniques: search for regular expressions
and left-to-right and right-to-left chart-parsing.
The first technique looks for a particular set of
markers (regular expressions) encoding temporal
information. These markers can be stand-alone
or parsing-triggering. The stand-alone markers
are inactive chart elements (not necessarily a sin-
gle word) which represent autonomous temporal
expressions. The adverb then in Then, this was
the only solution is an example of a stand-alone
marker.
The second technique of the CSS is launched, if
the system identifies a parsing-triggering marker.
The parsing-triggering markers are active chart el-
ements which signal the presence of a larger tem-
poral expression (for example before in three weeks
before Christmas) and trigger a chart-parsing pro-
cedure for its identification. The chart-parsing
scans the left and the right context of the marker
in order to determine which lexical units from
this context belong to the temporal expression.
The identified entire temporal expression repre-
sents a temporal marker (inactive chart element)
generated incrementally by association of chart el-
ements situated to the left and to the right of the
parsing-triggering marker (the initial active chart
element) (Wonsever and Minel, 2001).
The present paper is organised in 5 sections.
Section 2 is a short presentation of the CSS as
a method for goal-oriented information extrac-
tion. Section 3 discusses the classification of the
markers into stand-alone and parsing- triggering.
Section 4 shows a procedure launched by stand-
alone markers, namely, the identification of exclu-
sion zones. In turn, section 5 presents the chart-
parsing rules with the various semantic and syn-
tactic constraints on their realisation. The archi-
tecture of the system is shown in section 6.
2 The underlying principles of the
context-scanning strategy
The context-scanning strategy (CSS) (Descles et
al., 1997; Minel and Descles, 2000) is based on
the hypothesis that the semantic representations
are not necessarily determined by world knowl-
edge but can be considered as configurations in-
tegrating elements of local linguistic information.
The interaction of these elements is controlled by a
set of mechanisms which build the semantic repre-
sentation by putting together all the pieces of local
information. The elements of this representation
can be derived from grammar or lexical seman-
tics and from some syntactic phenomena which to-
gether account for the non-atomic (holistic) com-
positionality of semantic representations.
This hypothesis allows to formulate the two dis-
tinctive features of the CSS:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.952433166666667">
• The CSS is designed to carry out a very spe-
cific task: to identify and interpret all the
surface linguistic elements which account for
a particular semantic representation. It does
not claim to provide a complete analysis of
texts.
• The CSS extracts sets of interactive elements
integrated in complex semantic representa-
tions. Unlike the approaches based on world
knowledge, it deduces these representations
using exclusively linguistic data found in the
text.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927230769231">
The system presented in this paper satisfies
both features. The specific task of the system
(first feature) is to indentify all non-verbal linguis-
tic units which can convey temporal information
and to group them in sets. These sets are called
temporal expressions and may contain one or more
members.
All temporal expressions are considered as se-
mantic functions whose argument is the seman-
tic value of the grammatical tense in the analysed
utterance. The result of the application of this
function to its argument is the semantic (aspecto-
temporal) value of the entire utterance. Thus,
the identification of the temporal expressions is
an important step in the deduction of a semantic
representation which integrates information from
different linguistic units (second feature). Utter-
ances in 1 and 2 show the role of the temporal
expressions in this deduction. Example 1 denotes
an event which took place before the utterance
time. In turn, the lack of temporal expression in 2
entails a double interpretation: the utterance can
refer either to the fact of Jeanne&apos;s departure in a
past moment, or to the fact that Jeanne is absent
at the moment of utterance. This ambiguity is
manifested in the English translation of 2.

The discussion in this paper will focus only
at the first feature of the implemented CSS,
namely, the identification and regrouping of lin-
guistic units into temporal expressions.
As it was mentioned in the introduction, the
identification of the temporal expressions is car-
ried out at two steps: identification of markers
(stand-alone and parsing-triggering) and chart-
parsing applied to the left/right context of the
parsing triggering markers. These steps will be
discussed in detail in the three following sections.

<bodyText confidence="0.974617333333333">
All temporal markers (regular expressions) de-
tected by the system at the first step of the anal-
ysis fall into two sets: E and M (Efl M = 0).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988235">

The set E contains the stand-alone markers
which represent autonomous temporal expres-

<bodyText confidence="0.996832">
The stand-alone markers are grouped in two
subsets (E, n E2 = 0), defined with regard to
the structure of their elements.

<listItem confidence="0.8222875">

(for example, quand &apos;when&apos;), and a set of fol-
lowing lexical units bound to the right by a
particular syntactic category
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99618">
The set of lexical units following the markers of
E2 consitutes an exclusion zone. The identifica-
tion of this zone is discussed in section 4.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999174">
3.2 Parsing-triggering markers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981597761904762">
The markers included in the set M are both indi-
cators and constituent elements of a larger tempo-
ral expression. They are the active elements of a
chart-parsing procedure which they launch in or-
der to determine the boundaries of this expression
in the analysed sentence.
The temporal expressions signaled by the mark-
ers from this set can be represented by the follow-
ing contextual rule:
TemporalExpression LC.m.RC m EM (2)
where
LC is the left context of the marker m. It con-
tains an array of strings (lexical units) whose
syntactic categories have been authorised by
the right-to-left chart-parser (see section 5)
LC can be empty
&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; is the operator of concatenation
RC is the right context of the marker m. It
contains an array of strings (lexical units)
whose syntactic categories have been autho-
rised by the left-to-right chart-parser (see sec-
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.900378">
tion 5)
RC can be empty
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99872375">
All the markers in M have been organised in
three subsets M1, M2 and M3 (M1 fl M2 fl M3 =
0), according to the particularities of the chart-
parsers they trigger:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992332333333333">
• Markers triggering a left-to-right chart parser
(Mi). These markers represent the leftmost
lexical unit of the larger temporal expression
and launch parsing rules applying exclusively
to the right context of the marker. This set
contains markers like il y a &apos;ago&apos;, au cours
&apos;during&apos;, etc.
• Markers triggering a left-to-right and a right-
to-left parser (M2). The markers included in
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997892222222222">
this set never occur at the leftmost or at the
rightmost position in the larger temporal ex-
pression. Hence, the need to analyse both
their left and right context in order to iden-
tify the boundaries of the temporal expres-
sion they belong to. This is the largest of
the three sets and contains elements like the
names of the months, temporal units (minute,
seconde,..), names of the 4 seasons, etc.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.895718">
• Markers requiring a left-to-right and a right-
to-left parser (M3). These are the markers
which can occur at any position in the larger
temporal expression. However, the left and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.898099428571429">
right parsing rules may eventually rule out
the left and/or the right context as not be-
longing to the temporal expression and return
the detected marker as the only constructive
element of the temporal expression. An ex-
ample of such a marker is apres &apos;after&apos; in the
following sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99690075">
(3) Jeanne est arrivee trois minutes apres Pierre.
Jeanne came three minutes after Pierre.
(4) Jeanne est arrivee trois minutes apres.
Jeanne came three minutes later.
(5) Jeanne est arrivee apres Pierre.
Jeanne came after Pierre.
(6) Jeanne est arrivee apres.
Jeanne came later.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923379310345">
Example 3 shows a larger temporal expression
(trois minutes apres Pierre) which extends to the
left and to the right of the detected marker apres.
In example 4, the same triggering marker has only
a left context (trois minutes), the right one being
interpreted by the parser as empty (punctuation
mark stands for the end of a temporal expression).
Conversely, in example 5, the parsing rules will au-
thorise the association of elements (Pierre) from
the right context of the marker but will block the
association of such elements (arrivee) from its left
context. Finally, following the same line of reason-
ing as in examples 4 and 5, the parsing of example
6 will return the marker itself.
The above examples explain why it is impor-
tant to distinguish between the three sets of trig-
gering markers. The M1 markers signal temporal
expressions which only extend to the right of the
marker&apos;s position. The M2 markers signal tem-
poral expressions which extend to the right and
to the left of the markesr&apos;s position. Alone, M2
markers do not constitute a temporal expression.
The markers of M3 can be used alone as temporal
expressions or constitute such an expression to-
gether with other elements from their left and/or
right context.
The total number of markers detected by the
system is 121. They are subdivided as follows: El
(7), E 2 (36), M1 (13), M2 (51), M3 (14).

4 Exclusion zones
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99930348">
The temporal expressions introduced by conjunc-
tions like lorsque &apos;when&apos;, en meme temps que &apos;in
the same time as&apos;, etc (elements of the set 2)
are, with very few exceptions, subordinate tempo-
ral clauses. Thus, the extraction of these temporal
expressions comes down to the identification of the
boundaries of these subordinate clauses, in par-
ticular, of their right end, usually signalled by a
punctuation mark. The lexical units between the
conjunction and the punctuation mark form an
exclusion zone (Wonsever and Minel, 2001), since
they become integrated into the temporal expres-
sion under a negative condition: the elements of
this set should not belong to the syntactic cate-
gory of PONC 1.
&apos;The system uses the shareware on-line tagger of
LATL.ch S.A.(Societe Anonyme) (www.latl.ch). The
notation for the syntactic categories in this discussion
follows the notation provided by the tagger: DET (de-
terminer), PRE (preposition), ADJ (adjective), PRO
(pronoun), NUM (numeral), NOC (common noun),
ADV (adverb), INF (infinitive), PPA (past participle),
PPR (present participle), CLI (clitic), COJ (conjunc-
tion), NOP (proper noun) and PONC (all punctuation
marks).

I should have put Motions Nos. 49 and 50 at
the same time as Motion No.44.
However, the subordinate clauses may contain
inserted segments, separated by various punctua-
tion marks which do not fix the end of the tempo-
ral expression. In order to handle such segments,
the system will scan the exclusion zones in two
steps.
The goal of the first step is to detect the verb
(VERB category) in the right context. If detected,
the VERB category starts the second step whose
goal is to find a PONC (punctuation category) to
the right of the verb. The latter signals the end
of the exclusion zone (in curly braces in 8).

5 Left and right chart-parser rules
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997873">
5.1 General principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985734444444444">
The left and right chart-parser rules triggered by
the M1, M2 and M3 markers are recursion-based
algorithms. These rules scan the tagged right and
left context of the marker and control the associ-
ation of the adjacent lexical units to the body of
the temporal expression signaled by this marker.
The control is carried out by the following context-
scanning parsing rules:
Rule for the left context:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.896871666666667">
while cat€ Cleft
m = wn .m
n = n - 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.907032384615385">
where
- w is a lexical unit from the LC
- n is the position of w in LC
cat is the syntactic category of w
m is temporal expression containg only the
parsing-triggering marker before the application
of the rule and completed at each loop by a new
element from the LC
&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; is the operator of concatenation
Cie/ t = {DET, PRE, ADJ, PRO, NUM, NOC}
- the set of categories authorised in the positions
preceding the marker m
Rule for the right context:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.529042">
while caturn€ °right

n = n + 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98053">
where
w is a lexical unit from the RC
n is the position of w in RC
cat is the syntactic category of w
m is the temporal expression containg only the
parsing-triggering marker before the application
of the rule and completed at each loop by a new
element from the RC
&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; is the operator of concatenation
Cr tght = {DET, ADJ, NUM, NOC, ADV, INF,
PPA, PPR, CLI, COJ, NOP} - the set of cat-
egories authorised in the positions following the
marker m
Each rule tries to recursively match a category and Cright)
from a built-in set (Cleft to the cat-
egory of the next lexical unit in the context. If
the two categories match, the lexical unit is as-
sociated to the temporal expression and the rule
moves on to check the category of the next lex-
ical unit. In turn, if the two categories do not
match, the rule blocks the association of the unit
to the temporal expression and signals the left, re-
spectively, the right boundary of the temporal ex-
pression. The analysis of example 10 below shows
the scanning procedure step by step (the marker
heures has been detected at a previous stage):
(10) Bs ont quitte Air France vers 10 heures pour
une courte promenade sur les Champs-Elysées.
They left Air France about 10 o&apos;clock for a
short walk on Champs-Elysées.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9713285">

left pass 2 &apos;10&apos; matches the built-in category NUM
in the scanning rule
the PRE category of the lexical unit
&apos;vers&apos; matches the built-in category
PRE in the scanning rule and asso-
ciates it to the already processed left
context: vers 10
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998496285714286">
left pass 3 the NOP category of the lexical unit
&apos;France&apos; is not in the rule&apos;s list of cat-

left and the system returns: vers 10
right pass 1 the PRE category of the lexical unit
&apos;pour&apos; is not in the category list of the
rule - the rule cannot move furhter
right and the system returns an empty
string
The string vers 10 heures constitutes the larger
temporal expression signaled initially by the trig-
gering marker heures. Formulated in terms of the
rules above it will have the form: w6.w7.m.0 (7 &amp;
6 are the positions of the lexical units in the LC).

5.2 Constraints in the chart-parsing rules
5.2.1 Adjacency constraints on the
positions of syntactic categories
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916497177777778">
The matching of categories discussed in the pre-
vious section is achieved by context-free rules - one
for the left and one for the right context of the
parsing-triggering marker, respectively.
However, this context-free algorithm will fail to
detect the boundaries of the temporal expression
in a number of cases where, following a success-
ful category matching, it will associate to this ex-
pression some elements which do not belong to its
body. Without additional restrictions to the rules,
the system will provide the following wrong right-
context analysis for example 11 (the marker annee
was detected at a previous stage):
(11) L&apos;annee derniere les actions de cette entreprise
ont augmente de 30%.
Last year the shares of this company rose by
30%.
pass 1 category of derniere is ADJ : authorised
pass 2 category of les is DET (determiner) : au-
thorised
pass 3 category of actions is NOC : authorised
pass 4 category of cette is DET : authorised
pass 5 category of entreprise is NOC : authorised
pass 6 category of ont is VAU (auxiliary): blocked
Since the syntactic categories DET and NOC
are in the list of the authorised categories, they
become accepted by the system regardless of their
position. The result of this overgeneration will be
the segment l&apos;annee derniere les actions de cette
entreprise &apos;last year the shares of this company&apos;.
To avoid this problem, the above context-free
rules have been modified to check the syntactic
categories which are adjacent to the syntactic cat-
egory under analysis and to verify, if a number
of adjacency constraints have been respected. An
example of such a constraint is the following rule:
If ADJ is immediately preceded by a NOC or by
an empty context, and if it is immediately followed
by DET, the DET is not an element of the temporal
expression.
In example 11 this constraint will block the as-
sociation of new elements to the right of the ADJ
derniere due to the empty context preceding the
ADJ2 and to the DET category (les) following the
adjective.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.482959">
5.2.2 Semantic constraints on the lexical
units
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984744">
Another constraint in the chart-parsing rules is
the condition on the semantics of the lexical units
in the context of the marker. This constraint af-
fects exclusively the nouns in the left context of
the markers from the set M3 (see section 3). Ac-
tually, the left context of these markers is a mod-
ifier of the expression constitued by the marker
and its right context. Thus, three minutes be-
fore his departure can be represented as (three
minutes (bef ore his departure)) where before
E M3 and his departure is its right context. The
internal organisation of these configurations de-
termines the semantics of the nouns occurring in
the left context of the marker: they have to de-
note a time period, like minutes, seconds, seasons,
etc. The set of these nouns is actually a subset
of M2 - the set of markers containing the names
of months, temporal intervals, etc...(see section 3).
In order to authorise the association of the noun to
the temporal expression, the scanning rule checks
if this noun is a member of this subset. If this
is the case, the rule moves left to the next lexical
unit. And conversely, if the noun is not a member
of this set, the associaiton is blocked and the rule
signals the boundary of the temporal expression.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.857262">
5.2.3 Symmetric-dependency constraints
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989422">
Symmetric-dependency constraints are indis-
pensable for processing coordinate structures.
First, they prevent the splitting of single tempo-
ral expressions like au mois de mars et au mois
d&apos;avril &apos;in March and in April&apos; into au mois de
mars and au mois d&apos;avril, respectively:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5813645">
(12) Les syndicats ont organise deux reunions au
mois de mars et au mois d&apos;avril.
The trade unions organised two meetings in
March and in April.
2The adjective is the leftmost element of the right
context of the marker armee.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.96424175">
Second, they allow to rule out the possessive use
of de or du, as in 13:
(13) Toutes les conditions sont reunies pour vous
permettre de gagner un billet avec vos Miles
de cet hiver.
We do our best to let you win a free ticket for
the Miles from (gathered) this winter.
and to keep coordinate structures, as in 14:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5024465">
(14) De 1980 a 1985, des milliers de Canadiens ont
Pu etre contamines par le VIH.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992021086956522">
From 1980 to 1985 thousands of Canadians
could have become contaminated by HIV.
The identification of the expression in 12 is car-
ried out by a rule looking for a symmetric depen-
dency between the left and the right context of
the parsing-triggering marker (mars). It checks
if its right context element, immediately following
the coordinate conjucntion (et), matches the be-
ginning of its left context. If the beginning of the
two strings matches (au ... au), the parser will
move to the next element in the context without
splitting the temporal expression. Otherwise, the
system returns an empty right context.
Example 14 will be processed by a similar rule,
except that the contexts will be checked in a re-
versed order. If an occurrence of de/du has been
detected in the left context of the marker, this
rule will check for a &amp;quot;symmetrical&amp;quot; preposition
(0, jusqu&apos;a, jusqu&apos;aul) in the marker&apos;s right con-
text. If such a preposition is present, the system
will continue the chart-parsing to the right. Oth-
erwise, it will skip the marker and will resume the
search in its left and right context.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.59082">
5.2.4 Relative clause constraints
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807571428571">
Identification of the boundaries of qui &apos;who&apos; rel-
ative clauses in the right context of the markers
plays an important role in the extraction of tem-
poral expressions.
If the relative clause modifies a grammatical
subject, the latter is not included in the temporal
expression (example 15)3:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.509601333333333">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999062166666667">
The meeting began, and 3 minutes later his
spokesman who had already announced the
good news left for the capital.
In turn, if the relative clause modifies another
argument of the predicate, this argument is in-

To identify the role of the modified element, the
system counts the number of tensed verbs (VERB
categories) to the right of the relative pronoun.
If Ti verbs = 1, then the detected verb belongs to
the relative clause. Hence, the modified element
is not a subject (example 16) and is included into
the temporal expression.
If nverbs &gt; 1, the system performs one more test
- it checks if the last detected verb is preceded by
et qui or et. This last test reflects the empirical
observation that the coordinated predicates in a
relative clause can occur exclusively in the follow-
ing schemata (et may or may not be followed by
qui):

• qui .. Verb) .. et (qui) .. Verb2
• qui .. Verb) , (qui) Verb2 ..et (qui) .. Verb3
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981325">
If the last test detects et qui or et to the left of
the last verb, the latter is a member of a pair of
coordinated predicats of the relative clause, mod-
ifying a non-subject argument. Such a construc-
tion would be processed similarly to example 16,
the only difference being the number of verbs in
the relative clause.
Else, if the last verb is not preceded by one of
the above elements, it belongs to the main clause
and stands for the predicate of the grammati-
cal subject - the element modified by the relative
clause (example 15).

If the system detects such a marker, it extracts
it from the sentence and resumes the search within
its left and right context. If both contexts are
empty, the index of sentences is incremented and
the same procedure repeats for sentence n+1. In
turn, if the system fails to detect a stand-alone
marker (during the first or any of the following
loops), it scans the sentence for parsing-triggering
markers.
If such a marker has been identified, the sys-
tem launches the chart-parsing rules with various
constraints in order to identifiy the larger tempo-
ral expression signaled by the parsing-triggering
marker. Once identified, the larger temporal ex-
pression is extracted from the sentence and its

7 Evaluation and conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954051979166667">
The system presented in this paper is developed in
Java (JDK 1.3) and extracts non-verbal temporal
expressions from non-annotated French texts us-
ing exclusively linguistic markers and local chart-
parsing techniques.
So far, approximately 25% of the mark-
ers have been tested on a large corpus
(Hansard Canadien 1986-1993, available in www-
rali.iro.umontreal.ca/TransSearch/ and contain-
ing about 50 mln words).
The performance of the system has been evalu-
ated using the following procedure:
1. A set of sentences containing occurrences of
markers in El, E2, M1, M2 and M3 have been
selected manually from the corpus. This set
contains approximately 100 sentences for each
marker.
2. The relevant temporal expressions in these
sentences have been identified manually.
Then, the same set of sentences has been pro-
cessed by the system.
The tests yield a recall of approximately 95%
and a precision of about 85%. The recall results
are determined mainly by the list of markers (key-
words) which unfailingly point to a relevant tem-
poral expression. Hence, if the system fails to
identify a temporal expression detected by a hu-
man, this would mean that this expression con-
tains a keyword which is missing in the built-in
list. Adding this keyword to the list will allow
to update the system without any major modifi-
cations. Some minor problems in the search for
regular expressions reduce the recall rate to 95%.
The lower rate of the precision results (85%) is
due to two problems:
• the extracted expression contains a temporal
marker but does not represent a relevant tem-
poral expression (e.g. un billet primes avec
vos Miles de cet hiver &apos;a winning ticket with
your miles of this winter&apos;)
• the boundaries of the extracted expression are
not correctly identified (this problem occurs
in processing exclusion zones as well as during
the chart-parsing)
The processing time for a sentence containing
an average number of temporal expressions (2)
ranges from 0.2 to 7.9 seconds. This considerable
variation is due to three factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.884083142857143">
• type of identified marker which may or may
not require a chart-parsing
• number of elements in the sentence which
have to be tested as potential temporal ex-
pressions due to their formal characteristics
(like seasons&apos; names, digits, etc.)
• connection speed (for the on-line POS tagger)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985337">
The following real example, containing 2 stand-
alone markers (samedi and vendredi) and 1
parsing-triggering one (lors d&apos;) is processed in
6 sec. approximately.

In this paper we present a system for identification of lexical non-verbal means of expressing temporal information in French texts.

The chart-parsing scans the left and the right context of the marker in order to determine which lexical units from this context belong to the temporal expression. The identified entire temporal expression represents a temporal marker (inactive chart element) generated incrementally by association of chart elements situated to the left and to the right of the parsing-triggering marker (the initial active chart element) (Wonsever and Minel, 2001). The present paper is organised in 5 sections. Section 2 is a short presentation of the CSS as a method for goal-oriented information extraction. Section 3 discusses the classification of the markers into stand-alone and parsing- triggering. Section 4 shows a procedure launched by standalone markers, namely, the identification of exclusion zones. In turn, section 5 presents the chartparsing rules with the various semantic and syntactic constraints on their realisation. The architecture of the system is shown in section 6. 2 The underlying principles of the context-scanning strategy The contex</context>

They are subdivided as follows: El (7), E 2 (36), M1 (13), M2 (51), M3 (14). 4 Exclusion zones The temporal expressions introduced by conjunctions like lorsque &apos;when&apos;, en meme temps que &apos;in the same time as&apos;, etc (elements of the set 2) are, with very few exceptions, subordinate temporal clauses. Thus, the extraction of these temporal expressions comes down to the identification of the boundaries of these subordinate clauses, in particular, of their right end, usually signalled by a punctuation mark. The lexical units between the conjunction and the punctuation mark form an exclusion zone (Wonsever and Minel, 2001), since they become integrated into the temporal expression under a negative condition: the elements of this set should not belong to the syntactic category of PONC 1. &apos;The system uses the shareware on-line tagger of LATL.ch S.A.(Societe Anonyme) (www.latl.ch). The notation for the syntactic categories in this discussion follows the notation provided by the tagger: DET (determiner), PRE (preposition), ADJ (adjective), PRO (pronoun), NUM (numeral), NOC (common noun), ADV (adverb), INF (infinitive), PPA (past participle), PPR (present participle), CLI (clitic), COJ (conjunction), NOP (proper nou</context>
