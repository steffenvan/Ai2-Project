Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961">
With the development of the corpus linguistics,
more and more language resources have been
established and used in language engineering
research and applications. As we all know, there
are different kinds of corpora for different kinds
applications. For example, the Chinese
Part-Of-Speech annotation corpus used to train
program for Chinese word segmentation and
POS tag, the Chinese tree bank used to Chinese
syntax study, and so on.
In this paper the constructing of a large-scale
Chinese-English parallel corpus, which is totally
above 500,000 pair sentences and the first year
task is 100,000 pair sentences, is described. The
applications of the large-scale Chinese-English
parallel corpus put emphasis on the sentence
template extracting for EBMT (Example-Based
Machine Translation) and translation model
training for SBMT (Statistical-Based Machine
Translation). The latent applications may include
the bilingual lexicon extraction, special term or
phase extraction, bilingual teaching,
Chinese-English contrastive study, etc.
Numerous corpus data gathering efforts exit all
of the world. The rapid multiplication of such
efforts has made it critical to create a set of
standards for encoding corpora. CES (Corpus
Encoding Standard), which is conformant to the
TEI Guideline for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI
2002), has been adopted by many corpus-based
work. The XML Corpus Encoding Standard
(XCES) is a part of the Guideline developed by
the Expert Advisory Group on Language
Engineering Standards (Ide, N., Bonhomme, P.,
Romary, L. 2000). The coding of our
Chinese-English Parallel Corpus is in broad
agreement with the TEI Guideline for electronic
texts.
In the following section, we first present a brief
review of the current status of Chinese corpora
with the emphasis on parallel corpus. Then the
XML coding principles for Chinese–English
parallel corpus are discussed in detail. Following
this is the sentence alignment algorithm used in
this project with a computer-aided checking
processing. Finally, we show the design of the
concordance of the parallel corpus and the
prospect to further development.

<bodyText confidence="0.58779625">
The Chinese Corpus constructing work started in
1920’s, See Zhiwei Feng (2001). The
machine-readable corpora established in 1980’s
are listed as following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955321357142857">
• Chinese Modern Literature Corpus
(1979), 5.27 Million Chinese
Characters, WuHan University;
• Modern Chinese Corpus (1983), 20
Million Chinese Characters, Beijing
University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics;
• Middle School Chinese Book
Corpus (1983), 1.06 Million Chinese
Characters, Beijing Normal University;
• Modern Chinese Word Frequency
Corpus (1983), 1.82 million Chinese

<bodyText confidence="0.982083660714286">
The first national large-scale Chinese corpus
project is proposed in 1991 by State Language
Commission in China. The Chinese texts used in
this corpus are selected carefully under the
condition of times, genre, and field. Now the
corpus is about 20 million Chinese characters.
From 1992, there are several large-scale Chinese
corpus constructed by different institutes. The
most noticeable in them is the Chinese POS
annotation corpus accomplished by Institute of
Computational Linguistics, Peking University,
with the cooperation with Fujitsu Company. The
content of this corpus is people’s daily, one of
the most popular newspapers in China. The
Chinese texts are segmented and added POS tag
with high precision. The total Chinese
Characters are about 27 million.
There are several Chinese corpora in Tsinghua
University also. The corpus, which is used for
Chinese segmentation study, includes 100
million Chinese characters. The Hua Yu corpus
(2 million Chinese characters) is a POS tagged
field-balance corpus. And the 10 percent of this
corpus has been used for constructing Chinese
tree bank.
These are also other valuable Chinese corpora
established in ShanXi University, Harbin
technical University, ShangHai Normal
University, City University of Hong Kong,
Taiwan Academia Sinica, University of
Pennsylvania and so on. Please refer to Zhiwei
Feng (2001) for detail.
In October 2001, a national corpus project, that
is, national 863 project about Chinese
Information Processing Platform, is launched.
It’s a cooperation project between five institutes
in China, including Institute of Software,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of
Computational Linguistics, Peking University,
Tsinghua University, Nanjing University and
Institute of Language, State Language
Commission. The content of corpora and
intended scale in this project are showed in table
1 in detail. The large-scale Chinese-English
parallel corpus described in this paper is one of
the scheming corpora in this project.
The multilingual corpus is important for
computational linguistics research and
contrastive linguistics study. So there are many
multilingual corpus have been established or
being developed in many institutes in China
mainland. The table 2 shows the
Chinese-English parallel corpus had been
constructed in Mainland China. There are also
some bilingual corpora about other language pair,
such as Chinese-Japanese, Chinese-German, etc.

Unlike single linguistic resource, the parallel

Chinese and English both are most popular
language in the world, we still encounter much
difficult in obtaining parallel corpus resource
from Internet for following reasons:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94544925">
• There are seldom web pages in China
provide the same content in English

freely other than literally with many

3.1 General Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953833333333">
The coding of the parallel corpus is in broad
agreement with the TEI Guideline for electronic
texts. The eXtendible Make-up Language (XML)
is used for the text coding. Textual features are
marked by tags enclosed within angle brackets.
For example, a title is marked by start tag &lt;title&gt;
and an end tag &lt;/title &gt;. Every element has some
attributes to identifier of the element.
The document type definition (DTD) for the
texts in the corpus may differs in some respects
from the TEI model. The general principle for
coding are based on following consideration:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945570384615385">
• Comply with TEI guide lines on the
whole;
• Define the tag with clear meaning used
by most people in china;
• Only used the attributes which can be
easily and automatically get from source
texts, except the alignment link, which is
the key attribute in this corpus and
several steps are used to keep high
precise (See section 4 for detail);
• Try to keep all the interim resource in
hand in case information loses, such as,
the title tag in HTML files.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996882083333333">
The overall structure of a Chinese-English
Parallel corpus is shown by this example:
&lt;article id=”UH001”&gt;
&lt;Header type =”Unix Handbook”&gt;
&lt;/Header&gt;
&lt;text&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
There are two main parts in a text: a header and
the main text. Every text has an unique identifier
that is, article id, in this case UH001 (indicating
text 001 of the Unix Handbook)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999934">
3.2 The header
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956481481481">
Each text is described by a header, which has
four parts in accordance with the TEI guidelines:
a file description, an encoding description, a
profile description, and a revision description.
The file description gives bibliographical
information on the source text. The elements
include title, author, www address (If the text is
obtain from Internet), etc. The encoding
description in our corpus is very brief, only the
project name and the DTD file name are listed.
The country or region use the language is
indicated in the profile description. The
description under &lt;language&gt; used in our corpus
is in terms of labels like: Mainland Chinese
(MaC), Hong Kong Chinese (HKC), Taiwan
Chinese (TwC), Singapore Chinese (SiC),
American English (AmE), British English (BrE),
Canadian English (CaE), etc.
Another tag used in the profile description is
&lt;textclass&gt;. According to the parallel resource
in hand, the texts are grouped into 4 genres (as
show in table 3), such as, News , Literature,
Science &amp; Technical,Government Report.
A series of changes are listed in the revise
description and specified the change, the date of
the change, the person responsible for the
change, and the nature of the change.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999805">
3.3 Text Units and Alignment Unit
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894421052632">
The corpus texts are segmented according to the
natural units, such as: chapter, paragraph,
sentence (S-unit), and word. The English words
are simply marked by spacing as in ordinary
written text. The Chinese words are not
indicated by space in order to avoid the segment
error.
An ID is given to every paragraph to indicate the
relative position in whole chapter. The sentence
is called S-unit, the same as Johansson, Ebeling
and Oksefjell (1999) to underline that they are
not necessarily sentences in a grammatical sense.
The sentence alignment type between Chinese
S-unit and English S-unit maybe 1:1, 2:1, 3:1,
1:2, 1:3,2:2, 3:2, 2:3. Links between parallel
texts are showed by attributes of S-Alignment.
One of the Chinese alignment unit (it may
beyond one S-unit) are linked with the
correspondence English alignment unit.

4.1 Algorithm Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885594594595">
The key attribute in this corpus is alignment link,
which connect the one or more Chinese sentence
with one or more correspond English sentence.
In order to keep high precise in sentence
alignment, several steps are used with the human
and computer cooperation.
The first step to extract structural information for
parallel corpus is paragraph alignment and
sentence alignment, that is noting which
paragraph and sentence in one language
correspond to which paragraph and sentence in
another language.
This problem has been studied by many
researchers and a number of quite encouraging
results have been reported. However, almost all
bilingual corpora used in research are clear
(nearly without sentence omission or insertion)
and literal translation bilingual texts. The
performance tends to deteriorate significantly
when these approaches are applied to noisy
complex corpora (with sentence omission or
insertion, less literal translation).
There are basically three kinds of approaches on
sentence alignment: the length-based approach
(Gale &amp; Church 1991 and Brown et al. 1991),
the lexical approach (key &amp; Roscheisen 1993),
and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu
1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.).
The first published algorithms for aligning
sentences in parallel texts are length-based
approach proposed by Gale &amp; Church (1991)
and Brow et al (1991). Based on the observation
that short sentences tend to be translated as short
sentences and long sentences as long sentences,
they calculate the most likely sentence
correspondences as a function of the relative
length of the candidates. The basic approach of
Brow et al. is similar to Gale and Church, but
works by comparing sentence length in words
rather than characters. While the idea is simple,
the models can still be quite effective when used
to clear and literal translated corpora. Once the
algorithm had accidentally mis-aligned a pair
sentence, it tends to be unable to correct itself
and get back on track before the end of the
paragraph. Use alone, length-based alignment
algorithms are therefore neither very robust nor
reliable.
Kay &amp; Roscheisen (1993) use a partial
alignment of lexical items induce a maximum
likelihood at sentence level. The method is
reliable but time consuming.
Chen (1993) combines the length-based
approach and lexicon-based approach together.
A translation model is used to estimate the cost
of a certain alignment, and the best alignment is
found by using dynamic programming as the
length-based method. The method is robust, fast
enough to be practical and more accurate than
previous methods.
The first sentence alignment model used to align
English-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed by
Wu (1994). For lack of cognates in
English-Chinese, he used lexical cues to add the
robust of his model.
All of these works are test on nearly clear and
literal translation bilingual corpora.
There are seldom papers related to paragraph
alignment. It&apos;s believed by most of the
researchers that the paragraph alignment is an
easier task than sentence alignment. Gale &amp;
Church (1991) suggest that the same
length-based algorithm can be used to align
paragraph also.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999468">
4.2 The Alignment Steps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.80416965">
Sentence alignment algorithm of our system can
be outlined as follows:
Step 1: Align sentence by the improved
length-based algorithm.(Desicibed in Sun
etc. 1999)
Step 2: A lexicon checking process is added to
judge all the alignment results in step 1.
A score is given to every alignment pair
(A Chinese word segmentation system is
used in this process to find Chinese
word).
Step 3: The alignments whose score above a
threshold C1 are judged as correct
alignment. Remove these correct
alignments from bilingual texts temporally.
Step 4: The rest parts are aligned again by length
based approach.
Step 5: Repeat step 2, the score of every
lignment is showed as a reference to human
checking.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999644">
4.3 Computer-Aided Checking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999689214285714">
It&apos;s obviously difficult to increase greatly the
accuracy and robust of sentence alignment only by
length based approach. So a lexicon checking
process is added to our system. The alignment
results obtained by length based approach are
checked by an English-Chinese lexicon. A score SA
is given to every alignment sentence pair. The
score SA is calculated by following idea, that is,
the twice number of correctly matched English
words and Chinese words to the sum of number
of English and Chinese words. In figure 2, the
interface for human checking is showed in order
to processes the noise Chinese-English parallel
resource.

4.4 Experiment Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999689875">
We tested our alignment algorithm with part of a
computer handbook (Sco Unix handbook). There
are about 4681 English sentences and 4430
Chinese sentences in this computer handbook

<bodyText confidence="0.99992352">
In this paper, we introduce the developing project,
that is, the constructing of a large-scale (above
500,000 pair sentences) Chinese-English parallel
corpus. The current status of Chinese corpora is
overviewed with the emphasis on parallel corpus.
The XML coding principles for Chinese–English
parallel corpus are discussed. The sentence
alignment algorithm used in this project is
described with a computer-aided checking
processing in order to processes the noise
Chinese-English parallel resource.. We show the
design of the bilingual concordance for the
parallel corpus, also.
As a beginning project, there is still much room
for further development. The parallel resource is
relative rare, so the new ways, such as, data
exchange with other researcher institute and
translation company, should be launched to
obtain more parallel resource which can be used
to research society. The coding principle should
be adjusted in real work. A coding rule in more
detail should form in near future. We also intend
to add the option for recommendation the
correspondence translation word for input
keywords in concordance tool.

The performance tends to deteriorate significantly when these approaches are applied to noisy complex corpora (with sentence omission or insertion, less literal translation). There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale &amp; Church 1991 and Brown et al. 1991), the lexical approach (key &amp; Roscheisen 1993), and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu 1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.). The first published algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel texts are length-based approach proposed by Gale &amp; Church (1991) and Brow et al (1991). Based on the observation that short sentences tend to be translated as short sentences and long sentences as long sentences, they calculate the most likely sentence correspondences as a function of the relative length of the candidates.

For lack of cognates in English-Chinese, he used lexical cues to add the robust of his model. All of these works are test on nearly clear and literal translation bilingual corpora. There are seldom papers related to paragraph alignment. It&apos;s believed by most of the researchers that the paragraph alignment is an easier task than sentence alignment.

The latent applications may include the bilingual lexicon extraction, special term or phase extraction, bilingual teaching, Chinese-English contrastive study, etc. Numerous corpus data gathering efforts exit all of the world. The rapid multiplication of such efforts has made it critical to create a set of standards for encoding corpora. CES (Corpus Encoding Standard), which is conformant to the TEI Guideline for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI 2002), has been adopted by many corpus-based work. The XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES) is a part of the Guideline developed by the Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards (Ide, N., Bonhomme, P., Romary, L. 2000). The coding of our Chinese-English Parallel Corpus is in broad agreement with the TEI Guideline for electronic texts.

The corpus, which is used for Chinese segmentation study, includes 100 million Chinese characters. The Hua Yu corpus (2 million Chinese characters) is a POS tagged field-balance corpus. And the 10 percent of this corpus has been used for constructing Chinese tree bank. These are also other valuable Chinese corpora established in ShanXi University, Harbin technical University, ShangHai Normal University, City University of Hong Kong, Taiwan Academia Sinica, University of Pennsylvania and so on. Please refer to Zhiwei Feng (2001) for detail. In October 2001, a national corpus project, that is, national 863 project about Chinese Information Processing Platform, is launched. It’s a cooperation project between five institutes in China, including Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computational Linguistics, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nanjing University and Institute of Language, State Language Commission.
