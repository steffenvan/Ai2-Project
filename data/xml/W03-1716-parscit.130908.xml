Peking University has been engaged in research
and development of the Semantic Knowledge-base
of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) in the last eight
years. This lexicon-building project was a collabo-
ration with the Institute of Computing Technology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences during 1994-1998,
and resulted in a machine-readable bilingual lexi-
con suitable for use with Machine Translation ap-
plications, which contained a fairly complete
characterization of the semantic classification, va-
lence specifications and collocation properties for
49 thousands Chinese words and their English
counterparts (Wang Hui, 1998).
Since 2001, the further development of SKCC
has been co-conducted by ICL and Chinese De-
partment of Peking University. At present, SKCC
has made great progress. Not only is the scale ex-
tended to 66,539 entries, but also the quality has
been immensely improved. The semantic classifi-
cation in the updated edition of SKCC is the em-
bodiment of the very latest progress in Chinese
linguistics and language engineering, while the
semantic descriptions are comprehensive and thor-
ough. It can provide rich lexical semantic informa-
tion for various NLP applications.

<bodyText confidence="0.991291434782608">
The Semantic Knowledge-base of Con-
temporary Chinese (SKCC) is a large
scale Chinese semantic resource devel-
oped by the Institute of Computational
Linguistics of Peking University. It pro-
vides a large amount of semantic informa-
tion such as semantic hierarchy and
collocation features for 66,539 Chinese
words and their English counterparts. Its
POS and semantic classification represent
the latest progress in Chinese linguistics
and language engineering. The descrip-
tions of semantic attributes are fairly
thorough, comprehensive and authorita-
tive. The paper introduces the outline of
SKCC, and indicates that it is effective for
word sense disambiguation in MT appli-
cations and is likely to be important for
general Chinese language processing.

2.2 Semantic Hierarchy

<bodyText confidence="0.951810212765958">
One of the most outstanding characteristics of
SKCC is that its semantic hierarchy is based on
grammatical analysis, rather than merely on gen-
eral knowledge (as illustrated in Figure 2 below).
This classification system represents the latest pro-
gress in Chinese semantics. It is very useful for
NLP applications(Zhan Weidong, 1997), as well as
compatible with various semantic resources, such
as Wordnet (Christiane Fellbaum. 1998), Chinese
concept dictionary (CCD)( Yu Jiangsheng, 2002),
HowNet(Dong Zhendong, 2000) etc. Currently,
the classification of all of the 66,539 entries has
already been completed.

2.3 Comprehensive Semantic Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99944875">
There is close correlation between lexical meaning
and its distribution. Oriented to MT and IR, one
aim of SKCC is to provide detailed semantic de-
scription and collocation behavior that in many
cases is likely to be uniquely associated with a sin-
gle sense. For example, following attribute fields
have been filled with values in the verb database
(see table 2).

To sum up, the above attributes fall into five
kinds of information below:

<listItem confidence="0.982217105263158">
(1) Basic information of entry, such as vocabulary
item, part of speech, sub-category, homograph
and pronunciation;
(2) Descriptions of word meaning, including sense
number, definition, and semantic categories;
(3) Semantic valence, thematic roles and combina-
torial properties for per words; this is the most
important part of SKCC and especially useful
for WSD and lexical semantics research;
(4) English translation and its POS tagging. If a
Chinese word has two or more English
counterparts, it will be regarded as different
entries respectively, and the collocation
information will also be given in relevant
fields. This can significantly improve the
quality of Chinese-English MT system.

<bodyText confidence="0.998909238095238">
As a large-scale lexical knowledge base, SKCC
combines the features of many of the other re-
sources commonly exploited in NLP work: it in-
cludes definitions and English translations for in-
dividual senses of words within it, as in a bilingual
dictionary; it organizes lexical concepts into a con-
ceptual hierarchy, like a thesaurus; and it includes
other links among words according to several se-
mantic relations, including semantic role, colloca-
tion information etc. As such it currently provides
the broadest set of lexical information in a single
resource. The kind of information recorded and
made available through SKCC is of a type usable
for various NLP applications, including machine
translation, automatic abstraction, information re-
trieval, hypertext navigation, thematic analysis,
and text processing.
In this section, we shall focus on the automatic
disambiguation of Chinese word senses involving
SKCC since it is most troublesome, and essential
for all the above NLP applications (Ide, 1998).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976256">
3.1 Determination of the polysemous words
and homographs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994489833333333">
In general terms, word sense disambiguation
(WSD) task necessarily involves two steps: (1) the
determination of all the polysemous words and
homographs in the text or discourse; and (2) a
means to assign each occurrence of a word to the
appropriate sense.
Step (1) can be easily accomplished by reliance
on SKCC. Firstly, each entry denotes one single
sense of per word in SKCC. Thus, if a word has
two or more senses, it will be regard as different
entries, and the &amp;quot;SENSE&amp;quot; field will be filled with
different number (as “菜”in table 3).
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.999066538461539">

<bodyText confidence="0.798247">
Secondly, SKCC marked all of the homo-
graphs in &amp;quot;HOMOMORPHISM&amp;quot; field, such as two
verbs &amp;quot;看&amp;quot;with different pronunciation in table 4.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.999683857142857">

Therefore, if either of the &amp;quot;SENSE&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;HOMOMORPHISM&amp;quot; fields is filled with value in
SKCC, the entry must be a polysemous word or
homograph.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996457">
3.2 WSD based on semantic categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999519571428572">
The senses of most Chinese polysemous words and
homographs belong to different semantic catego-
ries, and have different syntagmatic features in
context (Wang Hui, 2002) . SKCC gives detailed
description of such information in &amp;quot;AGENT&amp;quot;
and/or &amp;quot;OBJECT&amp;quot; fields as illustrated in table 5
below.

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9584234375">
Based on the above description, the target
word &amp;quot;清淡&amp;quot; in following POS-tagged text can be
accurately disambiguated:
[1] 一/m 杯/q 清淡/a 的/u 龙井茶/n
A cup of light Longjing tea.
[2] 农忙时/t 进城/v 的/u k/n 不/d 多/a ,t意/n
比较/d 清A/a。
When the season is busy, few farmers go to
town and the business is rather slack.
In sentence[1], the word modified by &amp;quot;清A&amp;quot;
is the noun&amp;quot;茶&amp;quot;(tea) , which is a kind of &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;;
while the word&amp;quot;清A&amp;quot; in sentence [2] is a predicate
of “business”. According to the different values
in &amp;quot;AGENT&amp;quot; field, it is easy to judge that these
two &amp;quot;清A&amp;quot; belong to two semantic categories, viz.
the former is &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;,and the latter is &amp;quot;slack&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987112">
3.3 WSD based on collocation information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845266666667">
As for the polysemous words or homographs be-
longing to the same semantic category, the differ-
ence between them usually manifests at the
collocation level. According to a study in cognitive
science, people often disambiguate word sense us-
ing only a few other words in a given context (fre-
quently only one additional word) ( Choueka,
1983). Thus, the relationships between one word
and others can be effectively used to resolve ambi-
guity. For example, Chinese verb &amp;quot;找&amp;quot; has two
senses: one is &amp;quot;寻找&amp;quot; (look for) and the other is &amp;quot;
退还&amp;quot; (give change). Only when the verb co-
occurs with the noun &amp;quot;钱&amp;quot; (money), it can be inter-
preted as &amp;quot;give change&amp;quot;; Otherwise, it means &amp;quot;look
for&amp;quot; (see table 6).

Table 6 Different senses of verb &amp;quot;找&amp;quot;
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.993190142857143">
According to table 6, the verb &amp;quot;找&amp;quot; in sen-
tence [1] below must be &amp;quot;look for&amp;quot;, because its
object is &amp;quot;k&amp;quot; (person), a kind of &amp;quot;entity&amp;quot;; while &amp;quot;
找&amp;quot;in sentence [2] has two objects, namely, indi-
rect object &amp;quot; 我 &amp;quot; (me) and direct object &amp;quot; 钱
&amp;quot;(money). Thus, its meaning is &amp;quot;give change&amp;quot;.
[1]他们/r 将/d 出去/v 找/v k/n。
They will go out to look for sb.
[2]售货员/n 还/d 没有/d 找/v 我/r 钱/n RC
The seller has not given change to me.
By making full use of SKCC and a large scale
POS-tagged corpus of Chinese, a multi-levels
WSD model is developed and has already been
used in a Chinese-English MT application.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931636363636">
SKCC is a well-structured Chinese-English bilin-
gual semantic resource, as described in the paper, it
has more than 66,000 Chinese words and their
English counterparts classified, and the accurate
description of about 1.5 million attributes further
enriched the abundance of lexical semantic knowl-
edge. It not only provides a deductive system of
word meaning and valuable semantic knowledge
for Chinese language processing, but also has great
theoretical significance in lexical semantics and
computational lexicography research.
