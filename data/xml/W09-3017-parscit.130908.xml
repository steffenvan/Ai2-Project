<bodyText confidence="0.993142">
The present paper outlines an ongoing project
of annotation of the extended nominal corefer-
ence and the bridging anaphora in the Prague
Dependency Treebank. We describe the anno-
tation scheme with respect to the linguistic
classification of coreferential and bridging re-
lations and focus also on details of the annota-

We present methods of helping the annotators
– by a pre-annotation and by several useful
features implemented in the annotation tool.
Our method of the inter-annotator agreement
is focused on the improvement of the annota-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925235294118">
The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2.0) is a
large collection of linguistically annotated data
and documentation (Hajič et al., 2006). In PDT
2.0, Czech newspaper texts are annotated on
three layers. The most abstract (tectogrammati-
cal) layer includes the annotation of coreferential
links of two types: grammatical coreference (typ-
ically within a single sentence) and textual coref-
erence (for pronominal and zero anaphora). The
current paper focuses on the present annotation
of extended textual coreference, where the
anaphoric expression is neither personal pro-
noun, nor zero. Also the annotation of bridging
anaphora on PDT is discussed.
In the last few years, a number of annotation
schemes have been released, three of which are
to be shortly presented here. The MUC is consid-
ered to be the most standard annotation scheme
(Hirschman, 1997) and it is used in more than
one application (MUC-6, MUC-7, ACE). The
advantage of this scheme is its simplicity and a
very detailed linguistically oriented coding
scheme. It has been however criticized for its
vague interpretation of the notion of coreference
and for the limited coverage of relations (only
identical relation between nouns is annotated).
One of the most well known later approaches is
MATE (Poesio, 2004) and its extension on the
GNOME corpus. The project is meant to be
multi-functional. The annotation scheme was pri-
marily developed for dialog acts analyses, but
may be easily adapted for any other investiga-
tion. In the extended GNOME scheme, the iden-
tical coreference is annotated along with some
bridging relations, such as ELEMENT, SUB-
SET, POSSession and OTHER for underspeci-
fied relations. In PoCoS (Krasavina and Chiar-
chos, 2007), a two layer coreference annotation
scheme was suggested: the Core Layer is general
and reusable, while the Extended Layer supports
a wider range of specific extensions.
In this document, we present the application of
coreference annotation on a slavonic language
(Czech). Czech has no definite article, so in
many cases, an anaphoric relation cannot be eas-
ily identified. That&apos;s why we concentrated solely
on coreference, i.e. on the case when two expres-
sions denote the same entity. Anaphoric relation
between non-coreferential objects is annotated
separately, together with some other types of
bridging anaphora (see 2.1).

2 Methods of coreference and bridging
anaphora annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998814375">
Subject to annotation are pairs of coreferring ex-
pressions, the preceding expression is called an-
tecedent, the subsequent one is called anaphor.
The (mostly manual) annotation of the ex-
tended coreference and bridging anaphora pro-
ceeds basically in one phase. Unlike
MUC/MATE/PoCoS projects, where annotation
is divided into two phases (identifying elements
that can come in coreference relation (so called
“markables”) and establishing anaphoric rela-
tion), we do not make preliminary annotation of
“markables”. Realizing the disadvantage of diffi-
cult agreement comparison, we still think that to
separate identifying “markables” is unnecessary
in case of a language without grammatical cate-
gory of definiteness.

2.1 The annotation scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990884375">
For the time being, we annotate textual corefer-
ence and bridging anaphora. In what follows, we
briefly present the classification of these two
types of context-dependences.
The cases where anaphor is a personal,
demonstrative or zero pronoun are already anno-
tated in PDT. In the present annotation, the most
cases of anaphoric expressions are expressed by
NP with nominal head, in some cases also by
pronominal demonstrative adverbs (there, then
etc.), adjectives (by named entities (e.g. Ger-
many – German) and possessive forms)), numer-
als or verbs (own – ownership), see ex. (1).
Textual coreference is further classified into
two types – coreference of NPs with specific or
generic coreference. This decision is made on the
basis of the expectation, that generic coreferen-
tial chains have different anaphoric rules from
the specific ones. Into this group, there is also in-
cluded a big number of abstract nouns, whose
coreference is not quite clear in every particular
case. So, the generic type of textual coreference
serves as the ambiguity group too.
In bridging anaphora we distinguish PART,
SUBSET and FUNCT traditional relations (see
e.g. Clark 1977), CONTRAST for coherence rel-
evant discourse opposites (e.g. People don&apos;t
chew, it&apos;s cows who chew) and further underspec-
ified group REST, which is used for capturing
bridging references – potential candidates for a
new bridging group (e.g. location – resident, rel-
atives, event – argument and some others).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99924">
2.2 Annotation Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990757631578947">
In order to develop maximally consistent annota-
tion scheme, we follow a number of basic princi-
ples. Some of them are presented below:
Chain principle: coreference relations in text
are organized in ordered chains. The most recent
mention of a referent is marked as antecedent.
This principle is controlled automatically (see
3.1.2). Chain principle does not concern bridging
anaphora.
Principle of the maximum length of corefer-
encial chains also concerns only the case of
coreference. It says that in case of multiple
choice, we prefer to continue the existing coref-
erence chain, rather than to begin a new one. To
satisfy this principle, grammatical coreferential
chains are being continued by textual ones, and
already annotated textual coreferences are con-
tinued by currently annotated non-pronominal
links in turn.
The principle of maximal size of an anaforic
expression: subject to annotation is always the
whole subtree of the antecedent/anaphor. This
principle is partially directed by the dependency
structure of tectogrammatical trees and may be
sometimes counter-intuitive. See ex. (1):
(1)Henry&apos;s brother Nicholas has owned the
Hall for 27 years. On Nicholas&apos; death, it
passed into the ownership of his nephew,
Yarburgh Greame
The principle of cooperation with the syntac-
tic structure of a given dependency tree: we do
not annotate relations, which are already caught
up by the syntactic structure of the tectogram-
matical tree. So, unlike most schemes, we do not
annotate predication and apposition relations.
Preference of coreference over bridging
anaphora: in case of multiple choice, we prefer
coreference.

3 The Tool and Data Format
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974428571429">
The primary format of PDT 2.0 is called PML. It
is an abstract XML-based format designed for
annotation of treebanks. For editing and process-
ing data in PML format, a fully customizable tree
editor TrEd has been implemented (Pajas &amp;
Štěpánek 2008).
TrEd can be easily customized to a desired
purpose by extensions that are included into the
system as modules. In this section, we describe
some features of an extension that has been im-
plemented for our purposes.
The data scheme used in PDT 2.0 has been
slightly extended to support the annotation of the
extended textual coreference (that has – unlike
the originally annotated textual coreference – a
type) and the bridging anaphora (that has not
been annotated before and also has a type). Tech-
nically, various kinds of non-dependency rela-
tions between nodes in PDT 2.0 use dedicated re-
ferring attributes that contain unique identifiers
of the nodes they refer to.

3.1 Helping the Annotators
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999345">
We employ two ways of helping the annotators
in their tedious task. First, we pre-annotate the
data with highly probable coreference relations.
The annotators check these links and can remove
them if they are wrong. This approach has
proved to be faster than letting the annotators an-
notate the data from scratch. Second, we have
implemented several supporting features into the
annotation tool (the TrEd extension) that help
during the annotation process.

3.1.1 Pre-Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942214285714">
We use a list of pairs of words that with a high
probability form a coreferential pair in texts.
Most of the pairs in the list consist of a noun and
a derived adjective, which are different in Czech,
e.g. Praha – pražský (in English: Prague –
Prague, like in the sentence: He arrived in
Prague and found the Prague atmosphere quite
casual). The rest of the list is formed by pairs
consisting of an abbreviation and its one-word
expansion, e.g. LR – Lesko (similarly in English:
USA – States). The whole list consists of more
than 6 thousand pairs obtained automatically
from the morphological synthesizer for Czech,
manually checked and slightly extended.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.756172">
3.1.2 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909762711865">
Several features have been implemented in the
annotation tool to help with the annotation.
Manual pre-annotation: If the annotator
finds a word in the text that appears many times
in the document and its occurrences seem to co-
refer, he can create a coreferential chain out of
these words by a single key-stroke. All nodes
that have the same tectogrammatical lemma
(t_lemma) become a part of the chain.
Finding the nearest antecedent: The annota-
tion instructions require that the nearest an-
tecedent is always selected for the coreferential
link. The tool automatically re-directs a newly
created coreferential arrow to the nearest one (in
the already existing coreferential chain) if the an-
notator selects a farther antecedent by mistake.
However, the rule of the nearest antecedent can
be broken in less clear situations. For example, if
there are three coreferential words in the text, A,
B and C (ordered from left to right), and the an-
notator connects A and C (overlooking B), and
later realizes that B is also coreferential with A
and creates the arrow from B to A, the tool re-
connects the CSA arrow to CSB. Thus, the
chain CSBSA is correctly created.
Preserving the coreferential chain: If the an-
notator removes an arrow and a coreferential
chain is thus interrupted, the tool asks the anno-
tator whether it should re-connect the chain.
Text highlighting: The annotation of the ex-
tended textual coreference and the bridging
anaphora is performed on the tectogrammatical
layer of PDT. However, the annotators prefer to
work on the surface form of the text, using the
tectogrammatical trees only as a supporting de-
piction of the relations. After selecting a word in
the sentences (by clicking on it), the tool deter-
mines to which node in the tectogrammatical
trees the word belongs. Then, the projection back
to the surface is performed and all words on the
surface that belong to the selected node are high-
lighted. Only one word of the highlighted words
is a lexical counterpart of the tectogrammatical
node (which is usually the word the annotator
clicked on – only in cases such as if the annotator
clicks on a preposition or other auxiliary word,
the lexical counterpart of the corresponding tec-
togrammatical node differs from the word
clicked on). Using this information, also all
words in the sentences that have the same
t_lemma (again, we use only the lexical counter-
parts) as the selected word, are underlined.
Words that are connected with the selected word
via a coreferential chain are highlighted in such
colors that indicate whether the last connecting
relation in the chain was textual or grammatical.
Moreover, all words that are connected via a
bridging anaphora with any word of this corefer-
ential chain, are highlighted in a specific color.

<bodyText confidence="0.997505333333333">
The annotation of the extended textual corefer-
ence and the bridging anaphora started in No-
vember 2008. Two annotators work on different
texts (each document is annotated only by one
annotator), except for a small overlap used for
measuring the inter-annotator agreement.
As of April 2009, about one fifth of PDT 2.0
data has been annotated. The detailed numbers
are summed in Table 1:

Inter-annotator agreement: For the purposes
of checking and improving the annotation guide-
lines, we require a more strict inter-annotator
agreement than agreement on sets (for corefer-
ence), often used in other projects (e.g. Pas-
soneau 2004). For both the extended textual
coreference and the bridging anaphora, we use
F1-measure for the agreement on the antecedent,
and Cohen&apos;s x (Cohen 1960) for the agreement
on the type of the link. In Table 2, the results of

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984807692308">
We have presented the annotation scheme and
principles for the extended textual coreference
and the bridging anaphora in PDT 2.0.
Pre-annotation and features of the annotation
tool that help the annotators have been described
in detail. We have presented basic statistics about
the annotation completed so far and results of
first measurements of the inter-annotator agree-
ment (which are difficult to compare to other ap-
proaches, as we do not use &amp;quot;markables&amp;quot;).
Improvement of the inter-annotator agreement
is in our focus for the upcoming stage of the
project. The experience shows that the agreement
is greatly affected by parameters of the text as a
whole. Short texts are generally far less demand-
ing for their interpretation than longer ones, texts
with many abstract and general notions allow
more possibilities of interpretation and so on.
Frequent problems causing inter-annotator dis-
agreement are of two types - different under-
standing of the content and inaccuracy of the
coding scheme. The first case is hardly to be
solved entirely. The problems of the second type
are being worked on: we prepare the detailed
classification of the inter-annotator disagreement
and regularly specify the annotation guidelines.

So, unlike most schemes, we do not annotate predication and apposition relations. Preference of coreference over bridging anaphora: in case of multiple choice, we prefer coreference. 3 The Tool and Data Format The primary format of PDT 2.0 is called PML. It is an abstract XML-based format designed for annotation of treebanks. For editing and processing data in PML format, a fully customizable tree editor TrEd has been implemented (Pajas &amp; Štěpánek 2008). TrEd can be easily customized to a desired purpose by extensions that are included into the system as modules. In this section, we describe some features of an extension that has been implemented for our purposes. The data scheme used in PDT 2.0 has been slightly extended to support the annotation of the extended textual coreference (that has – unlike the originally annotated textual coreference – a type) and the bridging anaphora (that has not been annotated before and also has a type). Technically, various kinds of non-dependency relations between nodes in PDT 2.0 use dedicated referring a</context>

The MUC is considered to be the most standard annotation scheme (Hirschman, 1997) and it is used in more than one application (MUC-6, MUC-7, ACE). The advantage of this scheme is its simplicity and a very detailed linguistically oriented coding scheme. It has been however criticized for its vague interpretation of the notion of coreference and for the limited coverage of relations (only identical relation between nouns is annotated). One of the most well known later approaches is MATE (Poesio, 2004) and its extension on the GNOME corpus. The project is meant to be multi-functional. The annotation scheme was primarily developed for dialog acts analyses, but may be easily adapted for any other investigation. In the extended GNOME scheme, the identical coreference is annotated along with some bridging relations, such as ELEMENT, SUBSET, POSSession and OTHER for underspecified relations. In PoCoS (Krasavina and Chiarchos, 2007), a two layer coreference annotation scheme was suggested: the Core Layer is general and reusable, while the Extended Layer supports a wider range of specific extensio</context>
