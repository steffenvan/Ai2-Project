Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999231526315789">
Utterance-based AAC systems have the poten-
tial to significantly speed communication rate
for someone who relies on a speech generat-
ing device for communication. At the same
time, such systems pose interesting challenges
including anticipating text needs, remember-
ing what text is stored, and accessing desired
text when needed. Moreover, using such sys-
tems has profound pragmatic implications as a
prestored message may or may not capture
exactly what the user wishes to say in a par-
ticular discourse situation. In this paper we
describe a prototype of an utterance-based
AAC system whose design choices are driven
by findings from theoretically driven studies
concerning pragmatic choices with which the
user of such a system is faced. These findings
are coupled with cognitive theories to make
choices for system design.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999947533333334">
There are more than 3.5 million Americans with
disabilities who cannot effectively use speech to
communicate (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005).
There are many conditions that can result in such
severe speech impairments including cerebral pal-
sy, autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain-stem
stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain
injury (TBI). Any one of these conditions can have
a negative effect on the quality of life of these
people. The field of Augmentative and Alternative
Communication (AAC) has, especially over the
last ten years, dramatically enhanced access to
communication for these individuals through the
use of high-tech systems. These electronic systems

<bodyText confidence="0.999729578947368">
allow the entering of text that is then converted to
natural-sounding synthetic speech. While the popu-
lation using AAC systems is quite diverse with
regard to their linguistic and cognitive skills, here
we focus on AAC systems for cognitively high-
functioning literate adults with motor impairments.
Even with a focus on this population, the com-
munication rates of people who use AAC systems
differ greatly based on their motor abilities and
available interface choices (Trnka et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, overall communication rates are
slow to the extent that they are acknowledged as
one of the most problematic areas of AAC interac-
tions. Rates of 10-15 words per minute have been
identified as upper limits for letter-by-letter selec-
tion on a keyboard (e.g., Wobbrock &amp; Myers,
2006)—a significant contrast to 130-200 words per
minute for spoken communication. These slow
rates and long pauses continue to be a major bar-
rier to the social, educational, and vocational suc-
cess, particularly when communicating with
unfamiliar partners who have little or no expe-
rience in conversing with someone who uses AAC.
One method that holds a great deal of promise
for enhancing communication rate is the use of
systems that offer a selection of prestored messag-
es. With these systems, a phrase or full sen-
tence/utterance can be selected at once. In such
systems, sometimes called utterance-based AAC
systems, people compose whole utterances in ad-
vance and store them for later use. These systems
appear to be best suited for situations where rela-
tively predictable conversational routines take
place. Examples include short, transactional ex-
changes in stores, restaurants, or other public plac-
es where services are provided.
Although it might appear that utterance-based
technology could solve the problem of slow com-

munication, at least in these predictable exchanges,
the individual who uses these prestored messages
must deal with additional challenges to use the
prestored messages that have been stored in their
system. Users must be able to: 1) remember that
they have messages prestored that are appropriate
for a given situation; 2) remember where these
messages are stored; and 3) access the desired
prestored messages with few keystrokes. In addi-
tion, it must be recognized that the prestored mes-
sages are not always going to exactly fit the
communicative situation in which the user finds
him/herself (e.g., a prestored message may not
have enough information for the needs of the part-
ner).This results in a fourth challenge to the user—
to decide if it is better to use the message as stored,
or either edit or construct a new one. Each chal-
lenge, or trade-off choice, directly affects commu-
nication rate.
An adequate solution to these challenges has
proven elusive over the years, despite a long tradi-
tion of research in utterance-based technologies
(e.g., Todman, 2000; Todman &amp; Alm, 1997; Tod-
man et al., 2008; Vanderheyden et al., 1996). What
has been lacking is a design process that employs a
theoretical framework (or perspective) dealing
with conversation conventions, empirical evidence
to identify priorities, and systematic testing to de-
termine whether the design enables the communi-
cator to achieve the goals of an interaction.
A hierarchy of conversational rule violations
based on a series of experimental studies has a
great deal of potential to positively influence the
design of future utterance-based technologies. In
this paper we first describe a set of such studies
and the resulting hierarchy. We then discuss the
implications of this hierarchy on the design of an
utterance-based AAC system, while integrating
considerations from cognition and Natural Lan-
guage Processing. Finally, we present our partially
implemented prototype system and describe plans
for evaluating this technology.

2 Theoretical Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99969301754386">
To shed light on the design of future utterance-
based technologies, studied conversational trade-
off choices that a person faces when using an ut-
terance-based system in goal-directed public situa-
tions with service providers who are unfamiliar
with AAC, and how the particular choices made
affect the attitudes and conversational behaviors of
these providers (Bedrosian et al., 2003; Hoag et al.,
2007; Hoag et al., 2004, 2008; McCoy, et al.,
2007). We were interested in determining which
message choices resulted in the most favorable
attitudes and conversational responses leading to
the success of the AAC customer’s goal in these
transactional exchanges.
Notice that no matter how well a user anticipates
text need, it is inevitable that some prestored mes-
sages are not going to exactly fit the pragmatic
context in which the user finds him or herself. Four
public situations (i.e., bookstore, movie theater,
small convenience store, hair salon) where such
mismatches could occur were studied in a series of
investigations. Possible pragmatic mismatches
were characterized in terms of rule violations ac-
cording to Grice (1975) who articulated a set of
classic conversational maxims that implicitly guide
people in exchanging information. Using video-
taped interactions across experiments, these viola-
tions were scripted in messages that involved
trade-off choices between prestored message use
and real time message construction. Specifically,
the trade-offs examined in these investigations
were between speed of message delivery and a
message with either: 1) repetitive information with
repetitive words or phrases; 2) excessive informa-
tion, with more information than was needed by
the listener but where the information was still top-
ically relevant; 3) inadequate information, lacking
some of the information needed by the listener, or
4) partly relevant information, where some of the
content was not topically relevant. An example of
such a trade-off involved the message choice of a
quickly delivered (i.e., 4 seconds) prestored mes-
sage with excessive information or one that was
delivered slowly (i.e., 90 seconds) to allow editing
of the excessive information.
In essence, these experiments simulated situa-
tions where the user was faced with a choice:
whether to quickly deliver a prestored message that
was not exactly what was desired because of the
pragmatic mismatch, or whether to take the time to
edit the message so that it was exactly what was
needed. The experiments looked at goal oriented
situations with unfamiliar partners. This is an ex-
tremely important set of circumstances where the
attitudes and actions of the communication partner
can greatly affect whether or not the user can inde-
pendently meet his or her goals.

The experimental hypothesis was that there ex-
isted a hierarchy of conversational maxims involv-
ing the maxims of speed, relevance, repetition, and
Informativeness, such that adherence to some of
these maxims would result in more positive eval-
uations by public service providers than others.
With regard to the results of the experiments, simi-
lar hierarchies of conversational rule violations
were found across experiments, such that some
violations, regardless of degree or particular public
setting, were indeed consistently responded to
more or less favorably than others. Consistently at
the bottom of the hierarchy (i.e., responded to least
favorably in all experimental situations, and with
less success in meeting the target customer’s goal)
were quickly delivered messages with only partly
relevant information. The finding places a high
priority on selecting entirely relevant messages. As
such, it suggests the development of a system ar-
chitecture that makes it easy and fast to retrieve
entirely relevant messages and difficult to retrieve
messages that are only partly relevant to the cur-
rent exchange.
On the other hand, consistently at the top of the
hierarchy were quickly delivered messages with
repetitive information. These messages were re-
sponded to the most favorably and with much suc-
cess in meeting the target customer’s goal. The
limited negative impact of the messages with repe-
tition indicated that modification of system design
to remedy this message flaw would yield less bene-
fit for the user.
The other trade-off choices, the fast inadequate
message, the slow adequate message, and the fast
excessive message, occupied the middle of the hie-
rarchy across the experiments, although their posi-
tions with regard to each other were not exactly the
same. Thus, the implications of these findings for
system design are a little less clear, but suggest that
users given options to edit or easily construct mes-
sages with respect to Informativeness.
In sum, these findings have several important
implications for future utterance-based technolo-
gies. A system design must provide a mechanisms
to maximize the availability of situationally rele-
vant prestored messages. Additionally, utterance-
based technologies must be integrated seamlessly
into an AAC system design that allows these pres-
tored messages to be easily edited for their exces-
sive or inadequate information. Finally, this
design must also support the on-line construction
of new messages, while still easily accessing pres-
tored messages when appropriate.

3 Prototype Development
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988391304348">
The research findings cited above, particularly
those regarding the critical role of relevance in
conversation, led to the underlying structure of the
prototype we are in the process of developing.
Specifically, we are interested in a prototype that
will support relevant conversation in familiar rou-
tine exchanges with relatively predictable content,
such as those that occur in public settings, as it is
these types of exchanges that provide the best situ-
ations in which to use prestored text. Schank and
Abelson (1977) suggested that people develop
mental scripts in such familiar situations (e.g.,
going to a restaurant), and that these scripts
(representing typical sequences of events) are ac-
cessed by people in order to act appropriately in
these situations, and understand/interpret what is
being said. Each script consists of a series of
scenes (subevents) that previous experience has led
one to expect to occur. According to the cognitive
theory, when faced with a new situation (e.g.,
going to a new restaurant), a person can pull up
his/her mental script and step through the scenes in
order to participate appropriately.
We propose an underlying organizational struc-
ture for prestored utterances that leverages this
mental script notion from cognitive science, as it
nicely supports the Bedrosian, Hoag, McCoy, and
Bedrosian findings about relevance. A slightly dif-
ferent notion of scripts has been used in previous
research in utterance-based technologies (e.g., Dye
et al., 1998; Alm et al., 2000). The notion referred
to here is inspired by the early work of Vander-
heyden (1995). In particular, in our prototype sys-
tem the prestored utterances are organized
(grouped and ordered) according to scenes within a
script. For example, a “going-to-a-restaurant”
script may have scenes associated with entering,
ordering drinks, ordering entree, paying, etc. Asso-
ciated with each of these scenes are the prestored
utterances appropriate for use during that scene
(e.g., utterances pertaining to entering might in-
clude, “Hello.” “Fine, thank you.”, “Non-
smoking.”).
Not only would this organization ensure the re-
levance of utterances to the current situation, but it
would also significantly aid the user in remember-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994682">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980102040816">
ing where these messages are stored so that they
can be accessed. Essentially the user could direct
the system to step through messages appropriate
for each scene of a given script as he/she is actual-
ly experiencing the scene. The utterance-based sys-
tem would have a “now point” which corresponds
to the scene in which the user is currently located
in the script. Utterances useful for the conversation
during that scene are easily available using very
few keystrokes. Moreover, because the script mir-
rors the way a user thinks about a typical situation
and how it flows from one scene to the next, the
interface could lead the user to utterances appro-
priate for the next scenes to be encountered. Thus,
users do not need to remember exactly which ut-
terances are stored; they need only to activate the
appropriate scene in the script to be shown relevant
messages that can be selected, as well as other
scenes that may follow.
At the same time, this underlying structure can
also provide time-saving benefits to the user with
respect to entering text. This is in part because of
its hierarchical organization [see Figure 1, influ-
enced by Vanderheyden (1995)]. At the top of any
given hierarchy, are the most general scripts which
can be used in a multitude of new situations (e.g., a
new type of restaurant that the user has never gone
to). As shown in the figure, the most general script
here involves a “going-to-a-restaurant” script with
scenes containing “general purpose text”. For in-
stance, in the ordering scene, slot fillers appropri-
ate for many different kinds of restaurants are
shown. Below this script, are scripts that pertain to
more specific types of restaurants (only two are
explicitly shown in the figure). In these scripts,
notice some scenes and text are inherited verbatim
from above, but text may also be added to or mod-
ified as appropriate for the situation and according
to the preferences of the user. By inherited we
mean that one or more scenes, with the corres-
ponding messages, from the most general script
would automatically be made available in the more
specific instances. Unavailable in other prestored
text systems, this feature is a significant benefit to
users, because they only have to enter the informa-
tion one time at the highest level of the hierarchy,
and yet they will have access to it again in other
scripts further down in the hierarchy.
Another advantage of the inheritance is that it
results in a consistent organization of messages
across scripts. When accessing any script within
the restaurant hierarchy, for example, not only can
users expect to find the entering scene that was
inherited from the “parent” script, they can also
expect to find the prestored utterances “Hello” and
“Fine, thank you” near the beginning of that scene.
This illustrates a memory enhancement feature of
this system that is not available in other prestored
text systems – consistency in placement of mes-
sages from one particular script to another. Over-
all, this underlying organizational structure, which
we will refer to as a deep structure, represents a
significant change in the way that utterance-based
systems in AAC have been designed. With respect
to appearance, or surface structure, some current
systems may have, for example, a restaurant
“page” consisting of a grid of small rectangular
boxes forming rows and columns across the com-
puter screen. Although each box would contain a
prestored message appropriate for use in a restau-
rant, there is no deep structure specifying how the
messages on that page should be organized
(grouped and ordered) nor how the messages might
be related (the notion of consistency) to those
stored on other pages. The only organizing prin-
ciple is that these messages are “things I can say in
a restaurant.” If the messages are not ordered (ei-
ther by row or column) in a way that steps the user
through a scripted sequence of events for a given
situation, the user must search through a set of
messages, some of which are unlikely to occur at
that stage in the interaction. This search process,
which is likely to include irrelevant messages, may
slow down the selection process and negatively
impact the rate of communication. Even if health
providers or manufacturers programmed messages
in these boxes to follow such a sequence, this
would still remain a surface structure “fix.” The
strength of our prototype is the deep structure—the
machinery—such that the consistent location of the
messages can be easily remembered and accessed
in a few keystrokes to enhance communication
rate. Additionally, the hierarchical advantage of the
deep structure provides the user with a choice of
scripts (depending on the specificity of the situa-
tion), and saves the user time and energy in enter-
ing text, making the user more independent in
meeting individual communication needs.

4 Communicating with the system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916982758621">
In this section we discuss the user interface and
what the user does in order to actually communi-
cate using the system which has been our focus to
date. Future work will investigate issues in enter-
ing prestored text into scripts and adapting the
scripts to the individual user. In a situation where
the user anticipates using prestored text, he or she
will be taken to a window menu where the desired
script (and scene) can be selected. The user may
then navigate to the script that best fits the actions
in which he or she is about to engage. Upon se-
lecting the script, the user will be taken to a screen
such as that displayed in Figure 2.
The large window at the top is the display win-
dow. This is where the words of the utterances se-
lected by the user to be spoken will be displayed.
There is a clear button to clear the display window
(on the left of the display) and a speak button (the
arrow on the right-hand-side of the display) that
causes the display window contents to be sent to
the speech synthesizer to be spoken.
The next area of the display helps users keep
their place and navigate within the chosen script.
First is the scene map which is a numerical repre-
sentation of the scenes in the current script. From
this, for instance, users can see that the script they
have selected contains seven scenes, and the scene
they are currently performing is scene number one
which corresponds to the “enter” scene. The num-
ber of the current scene is colored differently than
the rest. Below the scene map is a line of tabs, un-
der which are boxes containing prestored text that
can be selected by the user. In this case, the text for
the first five scenes of the script are displayed (or
partially displayed). These scenes are named “en-
ter”, “drinks”, “appetizer”, “soup/salad”, and
“entrée”. Under each of these scene-name tabs is
the list of possible prestored utterances associated
with the scene. For example, there are three pieces
of text displayed that would be appropriate for the
“enter” scene. As is the case with the scene-map,
the current scene (tab and utterances) is colored
differently from the others so that it is more salient
to the user.
Under the boxes are four tabs which bring up
overlays with some general prestored text that
might be needed at any time during the script. Ask-
ing for some assistance, talking with the waiter,
small talk with the table mate, and quickfires are
just some examples of the kinds of pages that
might be accessible. Finally, at the bottom of the
page are some navigation buttons for navigating in
the device. Here we see buttons that allow the user
to go to the device home page, move the script
backward and forward, and go to a page containing
a keyboard so a novel utterance can be composed.
The system is set up in a way that allows users
to select text that they might need while perform-

ing an action as they step through a scene. Thus, it
is assumed that the user would select text in left-to-
right order with the left-most scene being the ac-
tive scene (i.e., the scene the user is currently per-
forming). The user may select one of the boxes in
the active scene, and the text would be automati-
cally put up into the display window at the top.
The speak button (arrow in the upper-right corner)
is used to actually say the desired text. The user
could select and speak any number of utterances in
the active scene without any significant changes in
the display. If the actions the user is performing
have progressed to the next scene, then the user
may navigate to the appropriate text in two dif-
ferent ways. First, the user could click on the
scene map or displayed tabs to have the context
shift to the new scene. Once selected that scene
tab and associated text boxes will be shown on
the left-hand-side of the device. Second, if the
utterance that the user wishes to say is currently
visible on the screen, the user may simply select
that utterance. In this case, in addition to putting
the utterance in the display window making it
ready to be spoken, the screen will automatically
scroll over to display the scene from which the
utterance was chosen on the far left (revealing
subsequent scenes to the right of it on the
screen). Figure 3 displays an example of this kind
of movement, resulting from the user selecting the
“I’ll have the nachos” text from the appetizer scene
displayed in Figure 2. Notice that the scenes have
been shifted over--the appetizer scene (scene 3) is
now the active scene, and the text associated with
the button is now in the display window.
Figure 3 illustrates another feature of the system
– slot fillers that are specific to a script or scene.
Notice that “nachos” is colored differently than the
other words in this prestored text. This is an indica-
tion that it is a slot-filler and that other options for
filling that slot are available. To edit that text, the
user clicks on the highlighted word in the display
window, and a window such as that in Figure 4 is
displayed. The user may then select the filler
he/she desires, and it will replace “nachos” in the
display.
The system described is currently being imple-
mented. Yet to be integrated is a facility that will
enable more extensive editing of the text in the
display window and the specifics of easy access to
typing via an on-screen keyboard (for instances
where the user wishes to type an utterance from
scratch rather than using a prestored utterance).

Two separate comparative efficacy evaluations

training session, with respect to user learning va-

less instruction time, fewer errors/trials). Effec-
tiveness will involve a comparison, in a virtual

behavior changes (e.g., which system leads to more
positive attitudes toward the user, more effective
conversational behaviors in meeting user goals).
In the first efficacy evaluation, typically speak-
ing, nondisabled adults will be the participants,
eliminating bias due to the fact that they will have
had no previous experience using AAC systems. A
randomized controlled trial will be employed whe-
reby participants will be assigned to either the pro-
totype system group or the standard system group.
Each system will contain the same prestored mes-
sages, and the same virtual public setting will be
used in each group. Results will be used to refine
the training phase and modify the prototype soft-
ware if necessary. In the second evaluation, a sin-
gle subject experimental design involving an
adapted alternating treatment design will be em-
ployed with cognitively intact, literate, adult partic-
ipants who currently use prestored text systems.
Although such a design would expose each partici-
pant to each system (i.e., the prototype system and
the standard system), carryover effects are elimi-
nated due to counterbalancing the order of the two
conditions across participants, ensuring that there
are two equivalent and functionally independent
instructional sets for the conditions (Schlosser,
1999) (in this case, the instructional sets would
involve two virtual public settings and correspond-
ing prestored messages), and counterbalancing the
sets between conditions.

Storing and retrieving full utterances has been the
focus of a long tradition of work; Todman et al.
(2008) contains a nice overview of some of these
systems. The ScripTalker system (Dye et al.
1998a) is closest in theory to our system wit per-
haps the biggest difference being the variety of
utterances available (and the fact that their proto-
type seemed more geared toward people with low
literacy skills. While the overall architecture did
rely on the notion of scripts, the actual utterances
stored was one per task the user might want to per-
form. I.e., the scripts themselves were linguistic in
nature. Similar uses were found in other work from
that same group, for instance see (Alm et al. 1995)
and (Dye et al. 1998). In contrast we target users
with higher literacy skills and more variety in the
prestored text they might want to have available.
The script is used to organize the messages but
there are many messages available within a partic-
ular scene.
Other work such as the Talk System (Todman &amp;
Alm, 1997) is intended for social conversation and
the organization is quite different. As its intention
is so different, one would expect the stored content
to need to be updated very often in order to keep it
current. This is in contrast to the relatively endur-
ing nature expected in the types of conversations
we envision.
Another notable system is the FrameTalker
Project (Higgenbotham &amp; Lesher, 2005) uses a
looser notion of communication contexts. Our hy-
pothesis is the structure used there does not impose
enough organization over the utterances, especially
in the type of situations we envision for use. The
Contact system is a system that combines notions
from both Talk and the FrameTalker projects.
Finally, Langer &amp; Hickey (1997) describe a
whole utterance system that retrieved utterances
related to keywords via a keyword search on a
large database of utterances. In contrast, our sys-
tem would provide access to presumably a series of
utterances relevant to the current situation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999945055555556">
AAC systems that use prestored text have a great
deal of potential to speed communication rate and
improve attitudes of unfamiliar speaking partners
towards AAC users in public goal-oriented situa-
tions. In this work we applied empirical evidence
summarized in a hierarchy of conversational rule
violations (Bedrosian et al. 2000) to identify im-
portant principles of successful interaction with
AAC text. We then attempted to match appropriate
NLP technologies with these principles in order to
develop a different viewpoint for an AAC system
that used prestored text. Our design is based on
schema-theory (Schank &amp; Abelson, 1977) and en-
forces a structure over the prestored text that will
minimize irrelevant text and constrain the rest of
the text so as to facilitate remembering what text is
stored while minimizing keystrokes needed to se-
lect the text.

<abstract confidence="0.99922135">Utterance-based AAC systems have the potential to significantly speed communication rate for someone who relies on a speech generating device for communication. At the same time, such systems pose interesting challenges including anticipating text needs, remembering what text is stored, and accessing desired text when needed. Moreover, using such systems has profound pragmatic implications as a prestored message may or may not capture exactly what the user wishes to say in a particular discourse situation. In this paper we describe a prototype of an utterance-based AAC system whose design choices are driven by findings from theoretically driven studies concerning pragmatic choices with which the user of such a system is faced. These findings are coupled with cognitive theories to make choices for system design.</abstract>

These findings are coupled with cognitive theories to make choices for system design. 1 Introduction There are more than 3.5 million Americans with disabilities who cannot effectively use speech to communicate (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005). There are many conditions that can result in such severe speech impairments including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain-stem stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Any one of these conditions can have a negative effect on the quality of life of these people. The field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) has, especially over the last ten years, dramatically enhanced access to communication for these individuals through the use of high-tech systems. These electronic systems 19 allow </context>

According to the cognitive theory, when faced with a new situation (e.g., going to a new restaurant), a person can pull up his/her mental script and step through the scenes in order to participate appropriately.

In particular, in our prototype system the prestored utterances are organized (grouped and ordered) according to scenes within a script. For example, a “going-to-a-restaurant” script may have scenes associated with entering, ordering drinks, ordering entree, paying, etc. Associated with each of these scenes are the prestored utterances appropriate for use during that scene (e.g., utterances pertaining to entering might include, “Hello.” “Fine, thank you.”, “Nonsmoking.”).

This is in contrast to the relatively enduring nature expected in the types of conversations we envision. Another notable system is the FrameTalker Project (Higgenbotham &amp; Lesher, 2005) uses a looser notion of communication contexts. Our hypothesis is the structure used there does not impose enough organization over the utterances, especially in the type of situations we envision for use. The Contact system is a system that combines notions from both Talk and the FrameTalker projects. Finally, Langer &amp; Hickey (1997) describe a whole utterance system that retrieved utterances related to keywords via a keyword search on a large database of utterances. In contrast, our system would provide access to presumably a series of utterances relevant to the current situation. 7 Conclusions AAC systems that use prestored text have a great deal of potential to speed communication rate and improve attitudes of unfamiliar speaking partners towards AAC users in public goal-oriented situations.

Finally, we present our partially implemented prototype system and describe plans for evaluating this technology. 2 Theoretical Background To shed light on the design of future utterancebased technologies, studied conversational tradeoff choices that a person faces when using an utterance-based system in goal-directed public situations with service providers who are unfamiliar with AAC, and how the particular choices made affect the attitudes and conversational behaviors of these providers (Bedrosian et al., 2003; Hoag et al., 2007; Hoag et al., 2004, 2008; McCoy, et al., 2007). We were interested in determining which message choices resulted in the most favorable attitudes and conversational responses leading to the success of the AAC customer’s goal in these transactional exchanges. Notice that no matter how well a user anticipates text need, it is inevitable that some prestored messages are not going to exactly fit the pragmatic context in which the user finds him or herself. Four public situations (i.e., bookstore, movie theater, small convenience store, hair salon) where such mismatches could occur were studied in a series of investigations.

Specifically, we are interested in a prototype that will support relevant conversation in familiar routine exchanges with relatively predictable content, such as those that occur in public settings, as it is these types of exchanges that provide the best situations in which to use prestored text. Schank and Abelson (1977) suggested that people develop mental scripts in such familiar situations (e.g., going to a restaurant), and that these scripts (representing typical sequences of events) are accessed by people in order to act appropriately in these situations, and understand/interpret what is being said. Each script consists of a series of scenes (subevents) that previous experience has led one to expect to occur. According to the cognitive theory, when faced with a new situation (e.g., going to a new restaurant), a person can pull up his/her mental script and step through the scenes in order to participate a</context>

The user may then select the filler he/she desires, and it will replace “nachos” in the display. The system described is currently being implemented. Yet to be integrated is a facility that will enable more extensive editing of the text in the display window and the specifics of easy access to typing via an on-screen keyboard (for instances where the user wishes to type an utterance from scratch rather than using a prestored utterance). 5 Planned Evaluation Two separate comparative efficacy evaluations will be conducted to test both the efficiency and effectiveness (Schlosser, 1999) of the prototype system in contrast to a differently organized prestored text system. In each evaluation, efficiency will involve a comparison of the two systems, in a training session, with respect to user learning variables (e.g., which system is learned faster, with less instruction time, fewer errors/trials). Effectiveness will involve a comparison, in a virtual public setting environment with a service provider as the partner, dealing with user behavior changes and satisfaction (e.g., which system results in faster rates of prestored message selection, goal attainment, more satisfaction)</context>

In the second evaluation, a single subject experimental design involving an adapted alternating treatment design will be employed with cognitively intact, literate, adult participants who currently use prestored text systems. Although such a design would expose each participant to each system (i.e., the prototype system and the standard system), carryover effects are eliminated due to counterbalancing the order of the two conditions across participants, ensuring that there are two equivalent and functionally independent instructional sets for the conditions (Schlosser, 1999) (in this case, the instructional sets would involve two virtual public settings and corresponding prestored messages), and counterbalancing the sets between conditions. 6 Related Work Storing and retrieving full utterances has been the focus of a long tradition of work; Todman et al.

These electronic systems 19 allow the entering of text that is then converted to natural-sounding synthetic speech. While the population using AAC systems is quite diverse with regard to their linguistic and cognitive skills, here we focus on AAC systems for cognitively highfunctioning literate adults with motor impairments. Even with a focus on this population, the communication rates of people who use AAC systems differ greatly based on their motor abilities and available interface choices (Trnka et al., 2009). Nevertheless, overall communication rates are slow to the extent that they are acknowledged as one of the most problematic areas of AAC interactions. Rates of 10-15 words per minute have been identified as upper limits for letter-by-letter selection on a keyboard (e.g., Wobbrock &amp; Myers, 2006)—a significant contrast to 130-200 words per minute for spoken communication.

We propose an underlying organizational structure for prestored utterances that leverages this mental script notion from cognitive science, as it nicely supports the Bedrosian, Hoag, McCoy, and Bedrosian findings about relevance. A slightly different notion of scripts has been used in previous research in utterance-based technologies (e.g., Dye et al., 1998; Alm et al., 2000). The notion referred to here is inspired by the early work of Vanderheyden (1995). In particular, in our prototype system the prestored utterances are organized (grouped and ordered) according to scenes within a script. For example, a “going-to-a-restaurant” script may have scenes associated with entering, ordering drinks, ordering entree, paying, etc. Associated with each of these scenes are the prestored utterances appropriate for use during that scene (e.g., utterances pertaining to entering might include, “Hello.” “Fine, thank you.”, “Nonsmoking.”). Not only would this organization ensure the relevance of utterances to the current situation, but it would also significa</context>

Thus, users do not need to remember exactly which utterances are stored; they need only to activate the appropriate scene in the script to be shown relevant messages that can be selected, as well as other scenes that may follow. At the same time, this underlying structure can also provide time-saving benefits to the user with respect to entering text. This is in part because of its hierarchical organization [see Figure 1, influenced by Vanderheyden (1995)]. At the top of any given hierarchy, are the most general scripts which can be used in a multitude of new situations (e.g., a new type of restaurant that the user has never gone to). As shown in the figure, the most general script here involves a “going-to-a-restaurant” script with scenes containing “general purpose text”. For instance, in the ordering scene, slot fillers appropriate for many different kinds of restaurants are shown. Below this script, are scripts that pertain to more specific types of restaurants (only two are explicitly shown in the figure). In these scripts, notice some sc</context>
