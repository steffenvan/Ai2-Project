In this paper, we are proposing a multi-
lingual prototype that can effectively col-
lect, record and document medical data in
a domain specific environment. The aim
of this project is to develop an electronic

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972">
Speech technology has the ability to generate re-
source and time savings within a hospital environ-
ment. Recording and managing patient data from
non-English backgrounds can be achieved success-
fully through the implementation of a multilingual
voice system and a standardised electronic medical
decision support system such as ACAFE (ACAFE
2006) described in Section 5.3. By implementing
the ACAFE standardized protocols together with a
voice system, we are able to assist in the first stage
of the clinical pathway in the treatment and man-
agement of Asthma (see illustration of Stage 1 in
figure 3).
In this demonstration description, we are pro-
posing a multi-lingual voice system based on a
standardized patient management system called
ACAFE that can effectively collect patient data in
electronic format. The combination of the two sys-
tems would make it easier to assist in the recording
and documentation of vast amounts of information
whilst overcoming communication and efficiency
barriers. This data can then be aggregated and ana-
lyzed after the event to assist with clinical and per-
formance measures. This makes effective use of
emergency department resources while providing
the emergency staff with immediate access to im-
portant patient information.

3 Demo Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966929824562">
Our demo prototype integrates a voice recognition
system together with the ACAFE system described
in more detail in section 5.3. Our voice recognition
prototype relies on data extracted from the stan-
dardized treatment protocols that have been based
on research by ACAFE (ACAFE et al., 2006).
These standardized protocols form the basis of our
system-patient interaction to the medical sub-
domain (Starlander et al., 2005).
Since our system is heavily driven by ACAFE,
we have been able to minimize the requirement for
an open range of questions that require translation.
As a result, we only require the use of the gram-
mar-based language model (GLM) that has been
implemented using Nuance’s speech recognizer
(Nuance 2005), and not a statistical language
model (SLM).
The standardized protocols require no manipula-
tion or changes in tense as the ACAFE system is
essentially a decision support tool. The flexibility
of the decision support tool allows the clinician to
make the final decision and vary any responses or
inputs. Hence the range of questions our multilin-
gual system poses to the patient is also standard-
ized and limited. With the smaller set of questions
it is feasible for translation to occur via direct
ACAFE to&apos;target-language&apos; mappings (subject lan-
guage to many variations of a target-language).
The use of GLMs over SLMs for medical
speech translation has been proven to provide
higher translation accuracy (Rayner et al., 2004,
Rayner et al., 2005). We expect that by combining
the higher accuracy levels of recognition through
the use of GLMs with a limited set of possible
questions for a particular medical sub-domain, we
can achieve an improved translation success rate.
Currently, our system requires the Overseer
(such as a nurse) to specify the patient’s native
language (in our example Chinese Mandarin) and
problem sub-domain (in our example asthma).
From there, the Overseer can either speak a ques-
tion as defined in the protocols contained within
the ACAFE system (using English), or select one
using the terminal. The question is then rendered
using recorded audio (TTS is used as a fall back
strategy) and played to the patient. Once the pa-
tient responds verbally or physically (e.g. nod of
the head), the Overseer is required to enter that
response into the system.
The Overseer is capable of viewing reports that
detail a particular patient’s responses prior to fur-
ther analysis/treatment, or they can view statistical
reports. As a proof of concept, the Overseer can
generate a statistical report that details patient
background precipitating factors (numbers of res-
piratory tract infections, cold weather, exercise and
dust/pollens)

4 Suggested Scenario
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
The triage nurse will identify the patient’s native
language to enable the correct voice system trans-
lator. The voice system will translate the standard-
ized asthma management plan questions into the
patient’s native language.
Patient will answer each question in their native
tongue. The voice system will convert this infor-
mation into the ACAFE system format. When each
question has been answered, the ACAFE system
will store the answers and the voice system will
then follow through to the next ACAFE question.
Upon completion of the set of ACAFE based
questions the voice system will then provide a re-
view of the questions with answers in the ACAFE
system in either English or the native language. A
voice recording will also be stored to play back for
future reference.
Triage refers to the answers that have been col-
lated in the ACAFE system via the assistance of
the voice system. This information can be under-
stood by all emergency team staff as the voice sys-
tem has translated the answers of the patient into
English according to the standardized management
answers.
The Emergency Department now has a pre-
compiled list of patient information compliant with
Stage 1 of the clinical pathway contained in the
ACAFE system to help assist in the treatment of
asthma, without having to worry about communi-
cation difficulties between patient and medical
staff.

Triage Nurse: “Hello, what pains or difficulties
are you experiencing?”
Patient: “Understand English no good, asthma...”
Triage Nurse: “Can you confirm your language,
Mandarin or Cantonese?”
Patient: “Chinese, mandarin.”
Triage Nurse: “OK, what I will do now is use a
special machine to ask a few simple questions, you
can just answer yes or no, it will ask the questions
in mandarin so you can understand better. OK,
here we go... “
Triage nurse then activates the voice system which
goes through the set of ACAFE based questions in
mandarin.

<bodyText confidence="0.9931794">
The following section outlines each component
shown in the Overview diagram (Figure 2).
Audio Output – Renders questions (as required
by the Decision Support) in the Patient’s native
language using recorded speech, or Text-to-Speech
(TTS) if the recorded speech is not available.
Multi­lingual Recognition – The majority of
questions posed to the Patient are in the form of
yes/no questions. As such, the recognition of the
Patient’s utterance needs only to recognize basic
responses in the Patient’s selected native language.
ACAFE – Provided with the medical sub-
domain (e.g. asthma/breathing difficulties), speci-
fies questions according to a standard set of diag-
nosis questions.
Records – Records Patient responses to Ques-
tions (both textual and audio representations), final
outcome, and statistics that are used for both indi-
vidual Patient reporting and statistical reporting.
Reports – Provides individual Patient reporting
(i.e. native language, medical sub-domain, re-
sponses to questions, and final outcome) and statis-
tical reporting for the use of measuring the
relationship between asthma and the precipitating
factors.

5.3 Asthma Decision Support
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949157894737">
ACAFE is an electronic interface for the Emer-
gency Department that provides clinicians with a
decision support tool to assist in the management
and treatment of asthma. The system incorporates
clinical decision support based on current evidence
and guidelines that is simple to access, adaptable to
the needs of the clinicians working in the ER and is
capable of being integrated with existing medical
databases.
The system’s core focus lies in clinical pathways
for the treatment of asthma. This is shown in Fig-
ure 3 below. A clinical pathway in the medical
sense is a decision tree based on clinical assess-
ment that guides the management and further in-
vestigation of a patient with a particular clinical
problem. This decision tree has been based on con-
sensus guidelines and institutional protocols based
on the best available evidence for the management
of asthma.

In the ACAFE system the clinical pathway is
represented by the information required to ascer-
tain the severity of asthma to decide on a list of
further investigations, consultations and medica-
tion orders. The clinical pathway outlines the
means through which the system can advise the
doctor on the optimal asthma management care
plan.
At this stage, our voice system will be integrated
with stage 1 of ACAFE’s clinical pathway, in par-
ticular the history/information collection side of

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994">
We have shown that the ACAFE system with the
assistance of our voice system can capture the in-
formation required to assist clinicians better man-
age the treatment of asthma in an emergency
department. In capturing this data, the ACAFE and
voice system incorporates the clinical pathways
and decision support in the workflow of the doctor.
In this demonstrator paper, we proposed a system
that:
Relies on ACAFE by providing an electronic
standardized protocol for the treatment of
asthma.
Allows multi-lingual support thereby increasing
communication between medical staff and
patients during information collection and
follow-up review after the patient has been
discharged.
Increases efficiency by automating how infor-
mation is collected by assisting in the re-
cording and documentation of vast amounts
of information while also streamlining the
update of data electronically into the patient
medical system.
