To computationalists investigating the structure of co-
herent discourse, the following questions have become
increasingly important over the past few years: Can one
describe the structure of discourse using interclausal
relations? If so, what interclausal relations are there?
How many are required? A fair amount of controversy
exists, ranging from the parsimonious position (that
two intentional relations suffice) to the profligate posi-
tion (that an open-ended set of semantic/rhetorical re-
lations is required). This paper outlines the arguments
and then summarizes a survey of the conclusions of
approximately 25 researchers — from linguists to com-
putational linguists to philosophers to Artificial Intelli-
gence workers. It classifies the more than 350 relations
they have proposed into a hierarchy of increasingly se-
mantic relations, and argues that though the hierarchy
is open-ended in one dimension, it is bounded in the
other and therefore does not give rise to anarchy. Evi-
dence for the hierarchy is mentioned, and its relations
(which are rhetorical and semantic in nature) are shown
to be complementary to the two intentional relations
proposed by the parsimonious position.
How Many Interclausal Dis-
course Coherence Relations?
This paper proposes an answer to an issue that
keeps surfacing in the computational study of the
nature of multisentential discourse.
It has been argued fairly generally that mul-
tisentence texts (specifically, short texts such
•This work was supported by the Rome Air Development
Center under RADC contract FQ7619-89-03326-0001.
as paragraphs) are coherent by virtue of the
rhetorical or semantic relationships that hold
among individual clauses or groups of clauses (see,
for example, [Aristotle 54, Hobbs 79, Grimes 75,
Mann &amp; Thompson 88]. In this view, a text is only
coherent when the speaker aids the hearer&apos;s infer-
ential understanding processes by providing clues,
during the discourse, as to how the pieces of the
text interrelate. Such clues are often cue words and
phrases such as &amp;quot;in order to&amp;quot; (signalling a purpose
for an action) or &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; (signalling the next entity
in some temporal or spatial sequence); but they can
also be shifts in tense and mode (such as in &amp;quot;She
was gone. Had she been there, all would have been
well&amp;quot;), and even appropriate pronominalizations.
Various researchers in various intellectual sub-
fields have produced lists of such relations for
English. Typically, their lists contain between
seven and thirty relations, though the more de-
tailed the work (which frequently means the closer
the work is to actual computer implementation),
the more relations tend to be named. I have
collected the lists of over 25 researchers — from
philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g.,
[Quirk &amp; Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85]) to compu-
tational linguists (e.g., [Mann &amp; Thompson 88,
Hobbs 79]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers
(e.g., [Schank &amp; Abelson 77, Moore &amp; Paris 89,
Dahlgren 88]) — amounting to a total of more than
350 relations. The researchers and their lists ap-
pear below.
In this paper, I will call the assumption of these
researchers, namely that some tens of interclausal
relations are required to describe the structure of
English discourse, the Profligate Position.

Unfortunately, the matter of interclausal rela-
tions is not simple, and not everyone agrees with
this position. These relations are seldom explicitly
signalled in the text, and even when they are, they
seem to take various forms particular to their use
in context. This fact has led some researchers, no-
tably [Grosz &amp; Sidner 86], to question the wisdom
of identifying a specific set of such relations. They
argue that trying to identify the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; set is a
doomed enterprise, because there is no closed set;
the closer you examine interclausal relationships,
the more variability you encounter, until you find
yourself on the slippery slope toward the full com-
plexity of semantics proper. Thus though they do
not disagree with the idea of relationships between
adjacent clauses and blocks of clauses to provide
meaning and to enforce coherence, they object to
the notion that some small set of interclausal rela-
tions can describe English discourse adequately.
As a counterproposal, Grosz and Sidner sidestep
the issue of the structure of discourse im-
posed by semantics and define two very ba-
sic relations, DOMINANCE and SATISFACTION-
PRECEDENCE, which carry purely intentional (that
is, goal-oriented, plan-based) import. They use
these relations in their theory of the structure of
discourse, according to which some pieces of the
text are either subordinate to or on the same level
as other pieces, with respect to the interlocutors&apos;
intentions. I will call this position, namely that two
interclausal relations suffice to represent discourse
structure, the Parsimonious Position.
From the point of view of text analysis, the
Parsimonious approach seems satisfactory. Cer-
tainly one can analyze discourse using the two in-
tentional relations. However, from the point of
view of text generation, this approach is not suf-
ficient. Practical experience has shown that text
planners cannot get by on intentional considera-
tions alone, but need considerably more rhetor-
ical and semantic information in order to con-
struct coherent text (there are many examples; see
[McKeown 85, Hovy 88a, Moore &amp; Swartout 88,
Paris 88, Rankin 89, Cawsey 89]). In practical
terms, this means that text planning systems re-
quire a rich library of interclausal relations.
Questions such as

will not go away. Until it is resolved to the satisfac-
tion of the adherents both positions, further work
on text planning and discourse analysis is liable to
continue getting stranded on the rocks of misunder-
standing and disagreement. This paper suggests a
compromise that hopefully opens up the way for
further development.

An Unsatisfactory Solution

<bodyText confidence="0.9999835">
How can one reconcile the two sides? That is to
say, how can one build a library of interclausal re-
lations that are simultaneously expressive enough
to satisfy the requirements of text planning systems
but do not simply form an unbounded ad hoc col-
lection of semantic relations with no regard to the
intentional ones?
One answer is to produce a two-dimensional or-
ganization of relations, with one dimension con-
strained in the number of relations and the other
unconstrained (and increasingly semantic in na-
ture; see Objection 1 below). Such organization is
a hierarchic taxonomy of limited width but of un-
bounded depth; the more general a relation is, the
higher it is in the hierarchy and the fewer siblings
it has.
An appealing hierarchy is shown in Figure 1. It
displays a number of very desirable features. In
particular, the top few levels are strictly bounded:
no logical alternatives to ASYMMETRIC and SYM-
METRIC exist, and one level lower, under ASYM-
METRIC, following Grosz and Sidner there is no
need to use any other relation than DOMINATES
and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES at that level. In-
creasingly detailed relations appear at lower lev-
els, which (as is discussed below) remain relatively
bounded. Still, the more one specifies a particu-
lar relation to distinguish it from others, the more
semantic it necessarily becomes (since increasing
specification invariably introduces additional se-
mantic features; that is the nature of the specializa-
tion process), and the lower it appears in the hierar-
chy. Though one does eventually approach the full
complexity of semantics proper, the approach is not
unprincipled; each relation is always constrained by
its position in the hierarchy and inherits much of
its structural and other features from its ancestors.
In this scheme, one can (and the Parsimo-
nious do) perform discourse analysis and study dis-
course structure wholly at the level of DOMINATES

and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES, and never come into
conflict with the structural descriptions found em-
pirically by the Profligate. One is simply not being
as specific about the particular interclausal rela-
tions that make up the discourse.
However, this taxonomy is unsatisfactory. It is
impossible in practise to place into the hierarchy
with certainty most of the relations found necessary
by the Profligate. For example, the relation CAUSE
(of various kinds) is one of the most agreed-upon re-
lations. But is it to be classified as a type of DOM-
INATES Or of SATISFACTIONPRECEDES? Though it
seems able to function either way, this question is
impossible to answer, since none of the concepts
involved are clearly enough defined (certainly no-
body has provided a general definition of CAUSE —
how could one?; it has been the topic of centuries
of philosophical debate. And even the limited def-
inition required for the purposes of Computational
Linguistics in a particular application domain with
a given ontology of terms has not been provided
satisfactorily yet).

A Better Solution

The answer to the dilemma: It is a mistake to clas-
sify rhetorical and semantic relations under the re-
lations DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES.
This insight does not destroy the hierarchy; most
of its desirable properties are maintained. It does
mean, however, that a new top-level organization
must be found and that the role of intentional re-
lations vis a vis rhetorical/semantic relations must
be explained. I address the first point here, and
the role of the intentional relations later on.
I have not found any highly compelling top-level
organization. Ideally, the top level should parti-
tion the relations into a few (say, three or four)
major groups that share some rhetorical or se-
mantic property. In the absence of a more com-
pelling suggestion (for which I continue to search),
I use here the top-level trifurcation of [Halliday 85],
which is based, roughly speaking, on the &amp;quot;semantic
distance&amp;quot; between the contents of the two clauses.
The three relations are ELABORATION, ENHANCE-
MENT, and EXTENSION. ELABORATION relations
hold between entities and their immediate con-
stituents or properties, and have a definitional fla-
vor; ENHANCEMENT relations hold between enti-
ties and their circumstances of place, time, manner,
etc.; and EXTENSION relations hold between enti-
ties and more distant entities such as causes, follow-
ups, contrasts, etc. Halliday&apos;s classification has
been modified and regularized by Matthiessen (per-
sonal communication). For want of compelling ar-
guments to the contrary, I use Matthiessen&apos;s mod-
ification of Halliday&apos;s ideas as the basis for the top
level of the hierarchy.
In order to construct the hierarchy, I collected
over 350 relations from 26 researchers in various
fields. I merged the relations, coming up with a
set of 16 on the second tier of the hierarchy, and
then classified more particular subrelations where
appropriate. The hierarchy of interclausal rela-
tions is given in Figure 2. The number associated
with each relation indicates the number of different
researchers who have listed the relation and may
serve as a vote of confidence in it.

hierarchy together with its proposers (identified

on sensitivity to generalization evinced by many
cue words and phrases. For example, the cue word
&amp;quot;then&amp;quot; is associated with SEQUENCE, and can be
used appropriately to indicate its subordinates SE-
QTEMPORAL and SEQSPATIAL, as in:
SEQTEMPORAL: First you play the long
note, then the short ones
SEQSPATIAL: On the wall I have a red
picture, then a blue one
In contrast, the cue words for the two subrelations
are specific and cannot be interchanged without in-
troducing the associated connotation:
SEQ TEMPORAL: After the long note you
play the short ones
SEQSPATIAL: Beside the red picture is the
blue one
Thus the relation associated with &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; subsumes
the relations associated with &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;beside&amp;quot;.
Similar observations hold for a number of the rela-
tions (e.g., SOLUTIONHOOD and RESTATEMENT).
Preliminary investigation indicates possible ad-
ditional evidence in the syntactic realization of
some relations: When a relation typically gives rise
to a dependent clause, then its subrelations tend to
do so as well. More study must be done by a trained
linguist.

Role of Intentional Relations

<bodyText confidence="0.996109492537314">
What then of the two relations DOMINATES and
SATISFACTIONPRECEDES? They do not appear
anywhere in the hierarchy in Figure 2.
The answer is that these two relations express
information that is independent of the rhetori-
cal/semantic meanings of the relations in the tax-
onomy and only apply in discourses with inten-
tional, plan-like nature. They derive from early
work on a highly plan-oriented domain [Grosz 81],
in which plan steps&apos; preconditions led to underly-
ing precedence orderings of plan steps and satis-
faction of subgoals which were dominated by su-
pergoals. However, not all discourse is plan-like;
a large proportion of everyday close discourse be-
tween people achieves goals for which, it can be
argued, no plans can be formulated (for some such
goals see [Hovy 88b]): the banter between friends
which serves to strengthen interpersonal bonds, the
discussions in supermarket lines, the language and
presentation styles employed in order to be friendly
or attractive, etc. Such communications also ex-
hibit internal structure, and also employ the rhetor-
ical/semantic interclausal relations.
However, it is not clear how to generalize DOMI-
NATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES to cover such
cases as well. One possible generalization is to use
the general relations HYPOTAXIS and PARATAXIS
(that is, asymmetrical and symmetrical relation-
ships:
HYPO: Joe left because Sue worked (0
Sue worked because Joe left)
PARA: He shouted when the horse
jumped (= the horse jumped when he
shouted)
respectively). But this does not work because both
DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are by
their natures asymmetrical. Another possible gen-
eralization is to use the two syntactic relations
MULTIVARIATE and UNIVARIATE (that is, contain-
ing an embedded syntactic type recursion (a gram-
matical rank shift) or not, as in:
MULTI: Sue&apos;s working caused [Joe to
leave] (S embedded in 5)
UNI: Joe left because Sue worked (two
coequal Ss)
respectively). This does not work either because
some DOMINATES relations hold between syntacti-
cally independent complete sentences, so no syn-
tactic embedding occurs.
Does this mean that the two intentional relations
should simply be added into the hierarchy? No,
because they can be realized in the discourse by
various rhetorical/semantic relations; for example,
SATISFACTIONPRECEDES can be expressed by SE-
QUENCE, as in:
First boil the water, then add the rice, and
then stir
or by CAUSE, as in:
The sun heats the desert, which causes the
air to rise, which causes a breeze
Thus, in the absence of other candidate gener-
alizations, one can conclude that the relations
DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are in-
dependent of the rhetorical/semantic taxonomiza-
tion and provide an additional dimension of infor-
mation, used for those discourses that exhibit an
appropriately intentional plan-like nature.

Some Objections Answered
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997008333333333">
A number of objections may be raised to the tax-
onomization presented here. I attempt to respond
to some of the more serious ones:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998027">
133
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9901215">
Objection 1. Does it make sense at all to or-
ganize into a single taxonomy such disparate en-
tities? After all, RESTATEMENT and CONCESSION
are primarily rhetorical while, say, PURPOSE and
PROCESSSTEP are primarily semantic.
Why not? As a result of this study and previ-
ous work, I believe that &amp;quot;rhetorical&amp;quot; relations are
simply the crudest or most generalized &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot;
ones; in other words, that rio purely rhetorical or
purely semantic relations exist. Some relations,
typically those higher in the hierarchy, certainly
fulfill a more rhetorical function (i.e., provide more
information about the argumentational structure of
the discourse) than a semantic function. But not
even the topmost relations are entirely devoid of se-
mantic meaning. Since all the relations have some
semantic import (regardless of their structural im-
port), this objection to their being arranged into a
single taxonomy for the purposes of discourse struc-
ture description is groundless&apos;.
Objection 2. What guarantee exists that the
relations given in the taxonomy are indeed the
&amp;quot;right&amp;quot; ones? Or the only ones? It is not diffi-
cult to come up with relations that differ in some
way from those in the taxonomy and that do not
neatly fall under a single item in it.
This is a standard objection to any set of terms
proposed to fulfill some function. The standard re-
sponse holds here too: there is no guarantee that
these are the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; relations, whatever &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;
may mean. Similarly, there is no guarantee that
the terms [VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE ADVERB ...
are the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; terms for types of words;
they have simply been canonized by long use and
much experience. There is enough evidence from
actual attempts at constructing working systems
(text planners and discourse analyzers) that rela-
tions at this level of interclausal representation are
required to guide inference and planning processes.
Without such relations we simply cannot construct
an adequate account of the structure of a discourse
1This position is in contradistinction with that of Sys-
temic Linguistics, which holds that semantic relations are of
the type Ideational while rhetorical relations are of the type
Textual. Since both kinds of relations serve the same func-
tion, namely to bind together different pieces of knowledge,
and certain relations operate both interclausally and intra-
clausally, there seems to me no reason to differentiate them
into two different types. I categorize discourse structure re-
lations with those called Ideational, and group separately
all those phenomena that reflect the characteristics of the
communicative setting: referentially available artifacts and
concepts, the nature of the medium (telephone, paper, con-
versation, etc.), and the physical and social context (back-
ground noise, available time, etc.).
nor plan an adequate multisentence paragraph by
computer.
The particular relations proposed here are cer-
tainly open to question, and their strongest support
is that they are the amalgamation and synthesis of
the efforts and proposed terms of over 25 different
investigators from different fields, as noted previ-
ously. In addition, there is always the possibility
that new interclausal relations will be needed that
cannot in fact be subsumed under existing nodes
in the taxonomy. While not impossible, I believe
this is unlikely, based on my experience in compil-
ing the hierarchy: After the top three levels had
more or less been established halfway through this
study, only one new second-level relation — IDEN-
TIFICATION — had to be added. I expect that when
new domains are investigated, the hierarchy will
grow primarily at the bottom, and that the ratio
of the number of relations added at one level to the
number of relations added at the next lower level,
averaged across all levels, will be well below 0.2.
Objection 3. The taxonomy is unbounded to-
ward the bottom: it places one on the slippery
slope toward having to deal with the full complex-
ity of semantic meaning. Simply working on the
structure of discourse is difficult enough without
bringing in the complexity of semantic knowledge.
This is the the Parsimonious Position objection.
There is no reason to fear the complexity of an
unbounded set of terms, whether semantic or not,
as long as the terms are well-behaved and sub-
ject to a pattern of organization which makes them
manageable. A hierarchicalization of the terms in
which all the pertinent information about discour-
sal behavior is captured at the top (which is maxi-
mally general, bounded, and well-understood) and
not at the bottom (which permits unboundedness
and redundancy) presents no threat to computa-
tional processing. Each discourse relation simply
inherits from its ancestors all necessary process-
ing information, such as cue words and realization
constraints, adding its unique peculiarities, to be
used for inferring its discoursal role (in parsing) or
for planning out a discourse (in generation). In-
creasing differentiation of relations, continued un-
til the very finest nuances of meaning are sepa-
rately represented, need be pursued only to the
extent required for any given application. Thus
&amp;quot;unbounded&amp;quot; growth of semantic relations is not a
problem, as long as they can be subsumed under
existing nodes in the taxonomy.
Objection 4. The hierarchy contains no explic-
itly structural relations, yet explicit signals of dis-

course structure are very common. Why are they
not included?
In fact, the relations people use to signal dis-
course structure (such as parallelism, say) are in-
cluded in the taxonomy. The most popular relation
(one that appeared as a separate relation in a num-
ber of the studies cited) is PARALLEL, which is in-
variably signalled using some set of SEQUENCE rela-
tions, often after having been explicitly introduced
by a separate clause. The fact that SEQUENCE
relations can be used to signal both semantic se-
quentiality and rhetorical structure is no reason for
alarm; if conditions should arise in which the two
functions require different behavior, a more specific
relation subordinated to SEQUENCE, dedicated to
expressing purely rhetorical sequentiality (such as,
say, SEQSTRUCTURAL), can be created, though it
is likely that in the actual presentation, the rhetor-
ical sequence will usually follow some temporal or
spatial sequence in any case.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955434782609">
A rather gratifying result of the synthesis presented
here is that only 16 core relations, organized into
3 principal types, suffice to cover essentially all the
interclausal relations proposed by the sources. This
suggests that other relations not yet in the hierar-
chy are likely to be subtypes of relations already
in it, preserving the boundedness of the number of
relation types. The relations are rhetorical in na-
ture, becoming increasingly semantic as they be-
come more specific; the claim is that the rhetorical
relations are simply least delicate (i.e., most gen-
eral) semantic relations.
While some evidence is provided for the struc-
ture of the hierarchy, as well as for the claim that
the relations are independent of the goal-oriented
plan-based discourse structure relations proposed
by [Grosz &amp; Sidner 86], there is no claim that this
hierarchy is complete or correct in all details. It
is certainly open to elaboration, enhancement, and
extension! The hope is that it will serve the com-
munity by proving to be a common starting point
and straw man for future work on discourse struc-
ture.

<abstract confidence="0.991596767857143">To computationalists investigating the structure of coherent discourse, the following questions have become increasingly important over the past few years: Can one describe the structure of discourse using interclausal relations? If so, what interclausal relations are there? How many are required? A fair amount of controversy exists, ranging from the parsimonious position (that two intentional relations suffice) to the profligate position (that an open-ended set of semantic/rhetorical relations is required). This paper outlines the arguments and then summarizes a survey of the conclusions of approximately 25 researchers — from linguists to computational linguists to philosophers to Artificial Intelligence workers. It classifies the more than 350 relations they have proposed into a hierarchy of increasingly semantic relations, and argues that though the hierarchy is open-ended in one dimension, it is bounded in the other and therefore does not give rise to anarchy. Evidence for the hierarchy is mentioned, and its relations (which are rhetorical and semantic in nature) are shown to be complementary to the two intentional relations proposed by the parsimonious position. How Many Interclausal Discourse Coherence Relations? This paper proposes an answer to an issue that keeps surfacing in the computational study of the nature of multisentential discourse. It has been argued fairly generally that multexts (specifically, texts such •This work was supported by the Rome Air Development Center under RADC contract FQ7619-89-03326-0001. as paragraphs) are coherent by virtue of the rhetorical or semantic relationships that hold among individual clauses or groups of clauses (see, for example, [Aristotle 54, Hobbs 79, Grimes 75, Mann &amp; Thompson 88]. In this view, a text is only coherent when the speaker aids the hearer&apos;s inferential understanding processes by providing clues, during the discourse, as to how the pieces of the text interrelate. Such clues are often cue words and phrases such as &amp;quot;in order to&amp;quot; (signalling a purpose for an action) or &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; (signalling the next entity in some temporal or spatial sequence); but they can also be shifts in tense and mode (such as in &amp;quot;She was gone. Had she been there, all would have been well&amp;quot;), and even appropriate pronominalizations. Various researchers in various intellectual subfields have produced lists of such relations for English. Typically, their lists contain between seven and thirty relations, though the more detailed the work (which frequently means the closer the work is to actual computer implementation), the more relations tend to be named. I have collected the lists of over 25 researchers — from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., [Quirk &amp; Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85]) to computational linguists (e.g., [Mann &amp; Thompson 88, Hobbs 79]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., [Schank &amp; Abelson 77, Moore &amp; Paris 89, Dahlgren 88]) — amounting to a total of more than 350 relations. The researchers and their lists appear below. In this paper, I will call the assumption of these researchers, namely that some tens of interclausal relations are required to describe the structure of discourse, the Position. 128 Unfortunately, the matter of interclausal relations is not simple, and not everyone agrees with this position. These relations are seldom explicitly signalled in the text, and even when they are, they seem to take various forms particular to their use in context. This fact has led some researchers, notably [Grosz &amp; Sidner 86], to question the wisdom of identifying a specific set of such relations. They argue that trying to identify the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; set is a enterprise, because there closed set; the closer you examine interclausal relationships, the more variability you encounter, until you find yourself on the slippery slope toward the full complexity of semantics proper. Thus though they do not disagree with the idea of relationships between adjacent clauses and blocks of clauses to provide meaning and to enforce coherence, they object to the notion that some small set of interclausal relations can describe English discourse adequately. As a counterproposal, Grosz and Sidner sidestep the issue of the structure of discourse imposed by semantics and define two very basic relations, DOMINANCE and SATISFACTION- PRECEDENCE, which carry purely intentional (that is, goal-oriented, plan-based) import. They use these relations in their theory of the structure of discourse, according to which some pieces of the text are either subordinate to or on the same level as other pieces, with respect to the interlocutors&apos; intentions. I will call this position, namely that two interclausal relations suffice to represent discourse the Position. From the point of view of text analysis, the Parsimonious approach seems satisfactory. Certainly one can analyze discourse using the two intentional relations. However, from the point of view of text generation, this approach is not sufficient. Practical experience has shown that text planners cannot get by on intentional considerations alone, but need considerably more rhetorical and semantic information in order to construct coherent text (there are many examples; see [McKeown 85, Hovy 88a, Moore &amp; Swartout 88, Paris 88, Rankin 89, Cawsey 89]). In practical terms, this means that text planning systems require a rich library of interclausal relations. Questions such as • Does one really need semantic and/or rhetorical discourse structure relations? • Just how many such relations are there? • What is their nature? How do they relate to the two intentional relations? will not go away. Until it is resolved to the satisfaction of the adherents both positions, further work on text planning and discourse analysis is liable to continue getting stranded on the rocks of misunderstanding and disagreement. This paper suggests a compromise that hopefully opens up the way for further development. An Unsatisfactory Solution How can one reconcile the two sides? That is to say, how can one build a library of interclausal relations that are simultaneously expressive enough to satisfy the requirements of text planning systems but do not simply form an unbounded ad hoc collection of semantic relations with no regard to the intentional ones? One answer is to produce a two-dimensional organization of relations, with one dimension constrained in the number of relations and the other unconstrained (and increasingly semantic in nature; see Objection 1 below). Such organization is a hierarchic taxonomy of limited width but of unbounded depth; the more general a relation is, the higher it is in the hierarchy and the fewer siblings it has. An appealing hierarchy is shown in Figure 1. It displays a number of very desirable features. In particular, the top few levels are strictly bounded: no logical alternatives to ASYMMETRIC and SYM- METRIC exist, and one level lower, under ASYM- METRIC, following Grosz and Sidner there is no need to use any other relation than DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES at that level. Increasingly detailed relations appear at lower levels, which (as is discussed below) remain relatively bounded. Still, the more one specifies a particular relation to distinguish it from others, the more semantic it necessarily becomes (since increasing specification invariably introduces additional semantic features; that is the nature of the specialization process), and the lower it appears in the hierarchy. Though one does eventually approach the full complexity of semantics proper, the approach is not unprincipled; each relation is always constrained by its position in the hierarchy and inherits much of its structural and other features from its ancestors. In this scheme, one can (and the Parsimonious do) perform discourse analysis and study discourse structure wholly at the level of DOMINATES</abstract>

One is simply not being as specific about the particular interclausal relations that make up the discourse. However, this taxonomy is unsatisfactory. It is impossible in practise to place into the hierarchy with certainty most of the relations found necessary by the Profligate. For example, the relation CAUSE (of various kinds) is one of the most agreed-upon relations. But is it to be classified as a type of DOM- SATISFACTIONPRECEDES? Though it seems able to function either way, this question is impossible to answer, since none of the concepts involved are clearly enough defined (certainly nobody has provided a general definition of CAUSE — how could one?; it has been the topic of centuries of philosophical debate. And even the limited definition required for the purposes of Computational Linguistics in a particular application domain with a given ontology of terms has not been provided satisfactorily yet). A Better Solution The answer to the dilemma: It is a mistake to classify rhetorical and semantic relations under the relations DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES. This insight does not destroy the hierarchy; most of its desirable properties are maintained. It does mean, however, that a new top-level organization must be found and that the role of intentional relations vis a vis rhetorical/semantic relations must be explained. I address the first point here, and the role of the intentional relations later on. I have not found any highly compelling top-level organization. Ideally, the top level should partition the relations into a few (say, three or four) major groups that share some rhetorical or semantic property. In the absence of a more compelling suggestion (for which I continue to search), I use here the top-level trifurcation of [Halliday 85], which is based, roughly speaking, on the &amp;quot;semantic distance&amp;quot; between the contents of the two clauses. The three relations are ELABORATION, ENHANCE- MENT, and EXTENSION. ELABORATION relations hold between entities and their immediate constituents or properties, and have a definitional flavor; ENHANCEMENT relations hold between entities and their circumstances of place, time, manner, etc.; and EXTENSION relations hold between entities and more distant entities such as causes, followups, contrasts, etc. Halliday&apos;s classification has been modified and regularized by Matthiessen (personal communication). For want of compelling arguments to the contrary, I use Matthiessen&apos;s modification of Halliday&apos;s ideas as the basis for the top level of the hierarchy. In order to construct the hierarchy, I collected over 350 relations from 26 researchers in various fields. I merged the relations, coming up with a set of 16 on the second tier of the hierarchy, and then classified more particular subrelations where appropriate. The hierarchy of interclausal relations is given in Figure 2. The number associated with each relation indicates the number of different researchers who have listed the relation and may serve as a vote of confidence in it. The following list contains each relation in the hierarchy together with its proposers (identified</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997639937007874">Some nonconclusive evidence supports parts of the hierarchy, though further study must be done to examine all the relations. This evidence is based 132 on sensitivity to generalization evinced by many cue words and phrases. For example, the cue word &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; is associated with SEQUENCE, and can be used appropriately to indicate its subordinates SE- QTEMPORAL and SEQSPATIAL, as in: SEQTEMPORAL: First you play the long short ones SEQSPATIAL: On the wall I have a red blue one In contrast, the cue words for the two subrelations are specific and cannot be interchanged without introducing the associated connotation: SEQ TEMPORAL: After the long note you play the short ones red picture is the blue one Thus the relation associated with &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; subsumes the relations associated with &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;beside&amp;quot;. Similar observations hold for a number of the relations (e.g., SOLUTIONHOOD and RESTATEMENT). Preliminary investigation indicates possible additional evidence in the syntactic realization of some relations: When a relation typically gives rise to a dependent clause, then its subrelations tend to do so as well. More study must be done by a trained linguist. Role of Intentional Relations What then of the two relations DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES? They do not appear anywhere in the hierarchy in Figure 2. The answer is that these two relations express information that is independent of the rhetorical/semantic meanings of the relations in the taxonomy and only apply in discourses with intentional, plan-like nature. They derive from early work on a highly plan-oriented domain [Grosz 81], in which plan steps&apos; preconditions led to underlyof plan steps and satissubgoals which were supergoals. However, not all discourse is plan-like; a large proportion of everyday close discourse between people achieves goals for which, it can be argued, no plans can be formulated (for some such goals see [Hovy 88b]): the banter between friends which serves to strengthen interpersonal bonds, the discussions in supermarket lines, the language and presentation styles employed in order to be friendly or attractive, etc. Such communications also exhibit internal structure, and also employ the rhetorical/semantic interclausal relations. However, it is not clear how to generalize DOMIand SATISFACTIONPRECEDES cover such well. One possible generalization is to use the general relations HYPOTAXIS and PARATAXIS (that is, asymmetrical and symmetrical relationships: HYPO: Joe left because Sue worked (0 Sue worked because Joe left) PARA: He shouted when the horse jumped (= the horse jumped when he shouted) respectively). But this does not work because both DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are by their natures asymmetrical. Another possible generalization is to use the two syntactic relations MULTIVARIATE and UNIVARIATE (that is, containing an embedded syntactic type recursion (a grammatical rank shift) or not, as in: MULTI: Sue&apos;s working caused [Joe to in left because Sue worked (two respectively). This does not work either because some DOMINATES relations hold between syntactically independent complete sentences, so no syntactic embedding occurs. Does this mean that the two intentional relations should simply be added into the hierarchy? No, because they can be realized in the discourse by various rhetorical/semantic relations; for example, SATISFACTIONPRECEDES can be expressed by SE- QUENCE, as in: boil the water, the rice, and or by CAUSE, as in: sun heats the desert, causes to rise, causes breeze Thus, in the absence of other candidate generalizations, one can conclude that the relations DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are independent of the rhetorical/semantic taxonomization and provide an additional dimension of information, used for those discourses that exhibit an appropriately intentional plan-like nature. Some Objections Answered A number of objections may be raised to the taxonomization presented here. I attempt to respond to some of the more serious ones: 133 1. it make sense at all to organize into a single taxonomy such disparate entities? After all, RESTATEMENT and CONCESSION are primarily rhetorical while, say, PURPOSE and PROCESSSTEP are primarily semantic. Why not? As a result of this study and previous work, I believe that &amp;quot;rhetorical&amp;quot; relations are simply the crudest or most generalized &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; in other words, that or relations exist. Some relations, typically those higher in the hierarchy, certainly fulfill a more rhetorical function (i.e., provide more information about the argumentational structure of the discourse) than a semantic function. But not even the topmost relations are entirely devoid of semantic meaning. Since all the relations have some semantic import (regardless of their structural import), this objection to their being arranged into a single taxonomy for the purposes of discourse structure description is groundless&apos;. 2. What exists that the relations given in the taxonomy are indeed the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; ones? Or the only ones? It is not difficult to come up with relations that differ in some way from those in the taxonomy and that do not neatly fall under a single item in it. This is a standard objection to any set of terms proposed to fulfill some function. The standard response holds here too: there is no guarantee that these are the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; relations, whatever &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; may mean. Similarly, there is no guarantee that the terms [VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE ADVERB ... are the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; terms for types of words; they have simply been canonized by long use and much experience. There is enough evidence from actual attempts at constructing working systems (text planners and discourse analyzers) that relations at this level of interclausal representation are guide inference and planning processes. Without such relations we simply cannot construct an adequate account of the structure of a discourse position is in contradistinction with that of Systemic Linguistics, which holds that semantic relations are of the type Ideational while rhetorical relations are of the type Textual. Since both kinds of relations serve the same function, namely to bind together different pieces of knowledge, and certain relations operate both interclausally and intraclausally, there seems to me no reason to differentiate them into two different types. I categorize discourse structure relations with those called Ideational, and group separately all those phenomena that reflect the characteristics of the communicative setting: referentially available artifacts and concepts, the nature of the medium (telephone, paper, conversation, etc.), and the physical and social context (background noise, available time, etc.). plan an multisentence paragraph by computer. particular relations proposed here are ceropen question, and their strongest support they are the amalgamation and synthesis of the efforts and proposed terms of over 25 different investigators from different fields, as noted previously. In addition, there is always the possibility that new interclausal relations will be needed that cannot in fact be subsumed under existing nodes in the taxonomy. While not impossible, I believe this is unlikely, based on my experience in compiling the hierarchy: After the top three levels had more or less been established halfway through this study, only one new second-level relation — IDEN- TIFICATION — had to be added. I expect that when new domains are investigated, the hierarchy will grow primarily at the bottom, and that the ratio of the number of relations added at one level to the number of relations added at the next lower level, across all levels, will be well below 3. taxonomy is unbounded toward the bottom: it places one on the slippery slope toward having to deal with the full complexity of semantic meaning. Simply working on the structure of discourse is difficult enough without bringing in the complexity of semantic knowledge. This is the the Parsimonious Position objection. There is no reason to fear the complexity of an unbounded set of terms, whether semantic or not, as long as the terms are well-behaved and subject to a pattern of organization which makes them manageable. A hierarchicalization of the terms in which all the pertinent information about discoursal behavior is captured at the top (which is maximally general, bounded, and well-understood) and not at the bottom (which permits unboundedness and redundancy) presents no threat to computational processing. Each discourse relation simply inherits from its ancestors all necessary processing information, such as cue words and realization constraints, adding its unique peculiarities, to be used for inferring its discoursal role (in parsing) or for planning out a discourse (in generation). Increasing differentiation of relations, continued until the very finest nuances of meaning are separately represented, need be pursued only to the extent required for any given application. Thus &amp;quot;unbounded&amp;quot; growth of semantic relations is not a problem, as long as they can be subsumed under existing nodes in the taxonomy. 4. hierarchy contains no explicstructural relations, yet explicit signals of dis- 134 course structure are very common. Why are they not included? In fact, the relations people use to signal disstructure (such as parallelism, say) included in the taxonomy. The most popular relation (one that appeared as a separate relation in a number of the studies cited) is PARALLEL, which is invariably signalled using some set of SEQUENCE relations, often after having been explicitly introduced by a separate clause. The fact that SEQUENCE relations can be used to signal both semantic sequentiality and rhetorical structure is no reason for alarm; if conditions should arise in which the two functions require different behavior, a more specific relation subordinated to SEQUENCE, dedicated to expressing purely rhetorical sequentiality (such as, say, SEQSTRUCTURAL), can be created, though it is likely that in the actual presentation, the rhetorical sequence will usually follow some temporal or spatial sequence in any case. Conclusion A rather gratifying result of the synthesis presented here is that only 16 core relations, organized into 3 principal types, suffice to cover essentially all the interclausal relations proposed by the sources. This suggests that other relations not yet in the hierarchy are likely to be subtypes of relations already in it, preserving the boundedness of the number of relation types. The relations are rhetorical in nature, becoming increasingly semantic as they become more specific; the claim is that the rhetorical relations are simply least delicate (i.e., most general) semantic relations. While some evidence is provided for the structure of the hierarchy, as well as for the claim that the relations are independent of the goal-oriented plan-based discourse structure relations proposed by [Grosz &amp; Sidner 86], there is no claim that this hierarchy is complete or correct in all details. It is certainly open to elaboration, enhancement, and extension! The hope is that it will serve the community by proving to be a common starting point and straw man for future work on discourse structure.</abstract>
