The centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) focuses
on the resolution of inter-sentential anaphora. Since
intra-sentential anaphora occur at high rates in real-
world texts, the model has to be extended for the res-
olution of anaphora at the sentence level. However,
the centering framework is not fully specified to han-
dle complex sentences (Suri &amp; McCoy, 1994). This
underspecification corresponds to the lack of a pre-
cise definition of the expression utterance, a term al-
ways used but intentionally left undefinedl . There-
fore, the centering algorithms currently under discus-
sion are not able to handle naturally occurring dis-
course. Possible strategies for treating sentence-level
anaphora within the centering framework are

1. processing sentences linearly one clause at a time
(as suggested by Grosz et al. (1995)),
2. preference for sentence-external antecedents
which are proposed by the centering mechanism,
3. preference for sentence-internal antecedents
which are filtered by the usual binding criteria,
4. a mixed-mode which prefers only a particular set
of sentence-internal over sentence-external an-
tecedents (e.g. Suri &amp; McCoy (1994)).

The question arises as to which strategy fits best for the
interaction between the resolution of intra- and inter-
sentential anaphora. In my contribution, evidence for a
mixed-mode strategy is brought forward, which favors
a particular set of sentence-internal antecedents given
by functional criteria.
&apos;Cf. the sketchy statements by Brennan et al. (1987,
p.155): &amp;quot;[...] U is an utterance (not necessarily a full clause)
[...]&amp;quot;, and by Grosz et al. (1995, p.209): &amp;quot;U need not to be a
full clause.&amp;quot;

Our studies on German texts have revealed that the
functional information structure of the sentence, con-
sidered in terms of the context-boundedness of dis-
course elements, is the major determinant for the rank-
ing on the forward-looking-centers (C (Un)) (Strube
&amp; Hahn, 1996). Hence, context-bound discourse ele-
ments are generally ranked higher in the C1 than any
other non-anaphoric element. The functional informa-
tion structure has impact not only on the resolution of
inter-sentential anaphora, but also on the resolution of
intra-sentential anaphora. Hence, the most preferred
antecedent of an intra-sentential anaphor is a phrase
which is also anaphoric. Consider sentences (1) and
(2) and the corresponding centering data in Table 1
(Cb: backward-looking center; the first element of the
pairs denotes the discourse entity, the second element
the surface). In sentence (1), a nominal anaphor oc-
curs, der T3100SX (a particular notebook). In sentence
(2), another nominal anaphor appears, der Rechner
(the computer), which is resolved to T3100S X from
the previous sentence. In the matrix clause, the pro-
noun er (it) co-specifies the already resolved anaphor
der Rechner in the subordinate clause.

cur, 58 of them (89,2%) have an antecedent which is a
resolved anaphor, while only 32 of them (49,2%) have
an antecedent which is the subject of the matrix clause
(cf. Table 3). These data indicate that an approach
based on grammatical roles (Suri &amp; McCoy, 1994) is
inappropriate for the German language, while an ap-
proach based on the functional information structure
seems preferable. In addition, we maintain that ex-
changing grammatical with functional criteria is also
a reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages.
They can be rephrased in terms of functional crite-
ria, simply due to the fact that grammatical roles and
the information structure patterns we defined, unless
marked, coincide in these languages.

Since the strategy described above is valid only for
complex sentences which consist of a matrix clause
and one or more subordinate clauses, compound sen-
tences which consist of main clauses must be consid-
ered. Each of these sentences is processed by our
algorithm in linear order, one clause at a time with
the usual centering operations. Compound sentences
which consist of multiple full clauses also have multi-
ple Cb/Cf data.
Now, we are able to define the expression utterance
in a satisfactory manner: An utterance U is a simple
sentence, a complex sentence, or each full clause of a
compound sentence3. The C1 of an utterance is com-
puted only with respect to the matrix clause. Given
these findings, complex sentences can be processed at
three stages (2a-2c; transitions from one stage to the
next occur only when a suitable antecedent has not
been found at the previous stage):

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882714285714">
In order to evaluate the functional approach to the res-
olution of intra-sentential anaphora within the center-
ing model, we compared it to the other approaches
mentioned in Section 1, employing the test set re-
ferred to in Table 2. Note that we tried to eliminate er-
ror chaining and false positives (for some remarks on
evaluating discourse processing algorithms, cf. Walker
(1989); we consider her results as a starting point for
our proposal).
First, we examine the errors which all strategies
have in common (for the success rate, cf. Table 4).
99 errors are caused by underspecification at differ-
ent levels, e.g., prepositional anaphors (16), plural
anaphors (8), anaphors which refer to a member of a
set (14), sentence anaphors (21), and anaphors which
refer to a global focus (12) are not yet included in the
mechanism. In 9 cases, any strategy will choose the
false antecedent.
The most interesting cases are the ones for which
the performance of the different strategies varies. The
linear approach generates 40 additional errors in the
anaphora resolution, which are caused only by the or-
dering strategy to process each clause of sentences
with the centering mechanism. The approach which
prefers inter-sentential anaphora causes 60 additional
errors. Note that this strategy performs remarkably
well at first sight. For 44 of the errors it chooses an
inter-sentential antecedent which is, on the surface,
identical to the correct intra-sentential antecedent. We
count these 44 resolutions as false positives, since the
anaphor has been resolved to the false discourse en-
tity. The approach which prefers intra-sentential an-
tecedents causes 27 additional errors. These errors
occur whenever an inter-sentential anaphor can be re-
solved with an incorrect intra-sentential antecedent.

out some elements of the current sentence by applying bind-

the context.

The functional approach causes only 3 additional er-
rors. These errors occur whenever the antecedent of
an intra-sentential anaphor is not bound by the context
(which is possible but rare) and when the anaphor can
be resolved at the text level.
The results change slightly if semantic/conceptual
constraints (type and further admissibility constraints)
on anaphora are considered. 22 errors of the lin-
ear approach, 8 errors of the approach which prefers
inter-sentential antecedents, and 12 errors of the ap-
proach which prefers inter-sentential antecedents can
be avoided. Only 6 errors of the functional approach
can be avoided by incorporating semantic criteria.
This might constitute a cognitively valid argument for
the functional approach — the better the strategy, the
lower the influence of semantics or world knowledge
on anaphora resolution.
To summarize the results of our empirical eval-
uation, we claim that our proposal based on func-
tional criteria leads to substantively better results for
languages with free word order than the linear ap-
proach suggested by Grosz et al. (1995) and the
two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intra-
sentential antecedents.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983777777778">
Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model
(Grosz et al., 1995) and its applicability to naturally
occurring discourse is the lack of a specification con-
cerning how to handle complex sentences and intra-
sentential anaphora. Grosz et al. suggest the pro-
cessing of sentences linearly one clause at a time.
We have shown that such an approach is not appro-
priate for some types of complex sentences. Suri
&amp; McCoy (1994) argue in the same manner, but we
consider the functional approach for languages with
free word order superior to their grammatical criteria,
while, for languages with fixed word order, both ap-
proaches should give the same results. Hence, our ap-
proach seems to be more generally applicable. Other
approaches which integrate the resolution of sentence-
and text-level anaphora are based on salience metrics
(Hajidova et al., 1992; Lappin &amp; Leass, 1994). We
consider such metrics to be a method which detracts
from the exact linguistic specifications as we propose
them.
At first sight, grammar theories like GB (Chomsky,
1981) or HPSG (Pollard &amp; Sag, 1994), are the best
choice for resolving anaphora at the sentence-level.
But these grammar theories only give filters for ex-
cluding some elements from consideration. Neither
gives any preference for a particular antecedent at the
sentence-level, nor do they consider text anaphora.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995391944444445">
In this paper, we gave a specification for handling
complex sentences in the centering model based on the
functional information structure of utterances in dis-
course. We motivated our proposal by the constraints
which hold for a free word order language (German)
and derived our results from data-intensive empirical
studies of real texts of different types.
Some issues remain open: the evaluation of the
functional approach for languages with fixed word or-
der, a fine-grained analysis of subordinate clauses as
Suri &amp; McCoy (1994) presented for SX because SY
clauses, and, in general, the solution for the cases
which cause errors in our evaluation.

At first sight, grammar theories like GB (Chomsky, 1981) or HPSG (Pollard &amp; Sag, 1994), are the best choice for resolving anaphora at the sentence-level. But these grammar theories only give filters for excluding some elements from consideration. Neither gives any preference for a particular antecedent at the sentence-level, nor do they consider text anaphora. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we gave a specification for handling complex sentences in the centering model based on the functional information structure of utterances in discourse. We motivated our proposal by the constraints which hold for a free word order language (German) and derived our results from data-intensive em</context>

Hence, context-bound discourse elements are generally ranked higher in the C1 than any other non-anaphoric element. The functional information structure has impact not only on the resolution of inter-sentential anaphora, but also on the resolution of intra-sentential anaphora. Hence, the most preferred antecedent of an intra-sentential anaphor is a phrase which is also anaphoric. Consider sentences (1) and (2) and the corresponding centering data in Table 1 (Cb: backward-looking center; the first element of the pairs denotes the discourse entity, the second element the surface).

An empirical evaluation indicates that the functional information structure guides the search for an antecedent within the sentence. 1 Introduction The centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) focuses on the resolution of inter-sentential anaphora. Since intra-sentential anaphora occur at high rates in realworld texts, the model has to be extended for the resolution of anaphora at the sentence level. However, the centering framework is not fully specified to handle complex sentences (Suri &amp; McCoy, 1994). This underspecification corresponds to the lack of a precise definition of the expression utterance, a term always used but intentionally left undefinedl . Therefore, the centering algorithms currently under discussion are not able to handle naturally occurring discourse. Possible strategies for treating sentence-level anaphora within the centering framework are 1. processing sentences linearly one clause at a time (as suggested by Grosz et al. (1995)), 2. preference for sentence-external antecedents which are proposed by the centering mechanism, 3. preference for sentence-internal anteceden</context>

Table 3). These data indicate that an approach based on grammatical roles (Suri &amp; McCoy, 1994) is inappropriate for the German language, while an approach based on the functional information structure seems preferable. In addition, we maintain that exchanging grammatical with functional criteria is also a reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages. They can be rephrased in terms of functional criteria, simply due to the fact that grammatical roles and the information structure patterns we defined, unless marked, coincide in these languages. cont.-bound -, bound H subj. -. subj.

(1995) and the two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intrasentential antecedents. 4 Comparison to Related Work Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) and its applicability to naturally occurring discourse is the lack of a specification concerning how to handle complex sentences and intrasentential anaphora. Grosz et al. suggest the processing of sentences linearly one clause at a time. We have shown that such an approach is not appropriate for some types of complex sentences. Suri &amp; McCoy (1994) argue in the same manner, but we consider the functional approach for languages with free word order superior to their grammatical criteria, while, for languages with fixed word order, both approaches should give the same results. Hence, our approach seems to be more generally applicable. Other approaches which integrate the resolution of sentenceand text-level anaphora are based on salience metrics (Hajidova et al., 1992; Lappin &amp; Leass, 1994).

Note that we tried to eliminate error chaining and false positives (for some remarks on evaluating discourse processing algorithms, cf. Walker (1989); we consider her results as a starting point for our proposal). First, we examine the errors which all strategies have in common (for the success rate, cf. Table 4). 99 errors are caused by underspecification at different levels, e.g., prepositional anaphors (16), plural anaphors (8), anaphors which refer to a member of a set (14), sentence anaphors (21), and anaphors which refer to a global focus (12) are not yet included in the mechanism. In 9 cases, any strategy will choose the false antecedent. The most interesting cases are the ones for which the performance of the different strategies v</context>
