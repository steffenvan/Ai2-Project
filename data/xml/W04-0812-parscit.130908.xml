1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991135">
This paper describes the Italian all-words sense
disambiguation task for Senseval-3: about 5000
words were manually disambiguated according to
the ItalWordNet (IWN) word senses. The first
section briefly describes of the corpus and the
lexical reference resource. The second section
contains some general criteria adopted for the
annotation of the corpus and illustrated by a series
of examples. Issues connected to the treatment of
phenomena typically found in corpora, e.g.
abbreviations, foreign words, jargon, locutions are
discussed. Furthermore, the encoding of
compounds, metaphorical usages, and multiword
units is described. Problems connected with i) the
high granularity of sense distinctions in the lexical
resource and ii) unsolvable ambiguities of the
contexts are dealt with. Finally, it is evidenced how
the annotation exercise can be of help in updating
or tuning IWN, by adding missing senses and/or
entries.

2 The Corpus and the Lexical Resource
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.661754">
The Italian all-words corpus consists of about
13600 word tokens, extracted from the SI-TAL 1,
Italian Syntactic Semantic Treebank (ISST). The
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.37633725">
1 SI-TAL (Integrated System for the Automatic
treatment of Language) was a National Project devoted
to the creation of large linguistic resources and software
tools for Italian written and spoken language processing.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996580388888889">
ISST (Montemagni et al. 2003) consists of i) a
generic corpus of about 215,000 tokens, extracted
from different periodicals and newspaper articles
(La Repubblica, Il Corriere della Sera) and ii) a
specialised corpus of about 90,000 tokens, with
texts belonging to the financial domain (Il Sole-
24Ore). The annotated corpus consists of about
5000 words and comprises a selection of Italian
newspaper articles about various topics: politics,
sport, news, etc. The common data format is XML.
The reference lexical resource used for the
Senseval-3 sense tagging task is the lexical-
semantic database IWN, developed within the
framework of two different research projects:
EuroWordNet (Vossen 1999) and SI-TAL, during
which IWN was extended by the insertion of
adjectives, adverbs and a subset of proper nouns.
The IWN database contains about 64,000 word
senses corresponding to about 50,000 synsets. It
has inherited the EWN linguistic model (Alonge et
al., 1998) which provides a rich set of semantic
relations, and the first nucleus of verbs and nouns.
IWN was structured around the notion of synset, a
set of synonymous word meanings, and the
information is encoded in the form of lexical-
semantic relations between pairs of synsets. The
IWN database comprises also an Interlingual Index
(ILI), based on the Princeton WordNet 1.5 used to
link wordnets of different languages so that it is
possible to go from the Italian words to similar
words in English language. IWN has also inherited
from EWN the Top Ontology (TO), a hierarchical
structure of language-independent concepts,
reflecting fundamental semantic distinctions. Via
the ILI, all the concepts in the wordnet are linked
to the Top Ontology.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.831836" genericHeader="method">
3 Annotation Procedure and Criteria
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993029411764">
For the Italian all-words task , the annotation
was carried out manually, word by word following
the text. For each word, annotators were supplied
with information about The tagging operation
consisted in the assignment of a sense number to
each full word or sequence of words corresponding
to a single unit of sense, such as compounds,
idioms, metaphorical usages, etc. The sense
number which refers to a specific synset was
assigned by the annotators according to the lexical
resource IWN. The assignment of a sense number
allows tagged words to inherit a series of semantic
information ranging from meronymy, synonymy,
hyperonymy, etc. up to the fundamental semantic
distinctions of the Top Ontology.
The annotation of the corpus was restricted to
nouns (2583), verbs (1858), adjectives (748), a
group of multiword expressions (97 – verb phrases,
adjectival phrases and noun phrases) and a set of
general proper nouns (163). Two linguists
disambiguated the texts. The annotators made
every effort to match a text word to a IWN sense,
but sometimes this could not be done, since the
required sense was not present in the reference
resource. Cases of difficult sense attribution and of
disagreement between annotators were marked and
left to further discussion and refinement.
Frequently, a tight interaction between the IWN
developers and the annotators was needed. By the
way, this collaboration produced a double-sided
effect: on the one side, the lexical resource gained
in coverage, being enlarged through the addition of
missing entries and/or senses and, on the other
side, the corpus encoding has been made possible.

3.1 Non-annotated cases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992070333333333">
Notwithstanding this, some cases have been left
“empty”. They are in particular terms with not
standard meaning, often absent from dictionaries2
as, for example: i) abbreviations (C.T.
Commissario Tecnico, Technical Officer); ii)
foreign words (e.g. off limits); iii) jargon (e.g.
fumantino adj. una persona fumantina, an irascible
person); iv) terms semantically modified through
evaluative suffixation (e.g. vetturetta, small car);
v) locutions (e.g. per carità!, for goodness’ sake!;
ci mancherebbe, that’s all we need); vi) words, or
sequences of words, indicating human association
groups (Caschi blu, the Blue Berets, Croce Rossa,
Red Cross, etc.), vii) nicknames (Scarpa d&apos;oro, lit.
Gold Shoe – to say a good football player, Primula

<footnote confidence="0.5669375">

or expressions extracted, in particular, from the soccer
domain, e.g. andare in percussione/in sovrapposizione
(lit. to go in percussion/in overlapping).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997911583333333">
Rossa, the Scarlet Pimpernel, a mafioso boss, etc.);
viii) neologisms (e.g. komeinista berlusconiano,
concerning Khomeini, Berlusconi).
This type of specific neologisms or idiomatic
expressions have a high frequency in corpora.
Corpus texts are extracted from newspaper articles
about politics, sports, news, etc. in which a high
number of words currently used in the everyday
language of media appear. Rarely a lexical
resource contains this new-born expressions hence
not completely meeting the requirements of
semantic annotation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987578">
3.2 Fully-compositional Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976166666667">
It may be the case that annotators had to deal
with complex expressions where the meaning is
compositional, e.g. Ministero della Difesa
(Department of Defence). Even if this sequence of
words could be perceived by native speakers as a
single multiword expression, the reference lexical
resource did not present it as an independent entry.
This is a case of fully compositional expression,
whose interpretation depends functionally on the
interpretation of its constituents. They were,
therefore, decomposed and annotated according to
their parts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996355">
3.3 Metaphorical Usages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874959183674">
Figurative and metaphorical usages were hard to
map to the correct sense: sometimes, it has been
necessary to accept for them, at least, a
compromise solution. Consider the following
context (where bold marks the figurative usage):
due lavoratori su tre sono a casa = essere
disoccupato
out of three workers, two are at home = to be
unemployed)
The interpretation of the context presupposes an
extra-linguistic knowledge, which cannot be
encoded at the lexical-semantic level of
description, even if the collocation with lavoratori
(workers) allows to correctly disambiguate. In this
case a (at home) represents an instance of a non
lexicalised metaphor, therefore it was not possible
to assign the appropriate figurative sense. A
compromise solution was adopted and the
individual components of the phrase were
annotated, even if the correct semantic contribution
of the multiword expression was lost.
Another interesting case is provided by the
occurrences of some metaphoric uses of verbs.
Consider these examples:
... è andata male in Spagna e non si è
qualificata alle ..., lit. in Spain it went badly and
did not qualify for the
... il rapporto andò avanti fino alle nozze, lit.
the relationship went ahead until wedding
In the first example, even if the verb is
frequently used with this meaning, it was not
possible to attribute a correct sense number, since
it was not accounted for in the lexical resource.
In the second case, the verbal locution andare
avanti was not present in IWN. In this context,
andare has been annotated with andare11, ‘to
progress’, which incorporates the meaning
provided by andare plus the adverb avanti (to go
ahead).
All the above mentioned cases of non-annotation
or compromise annotation evidence the
divergences between lexicon encoding, on the one
hand, in which senses are by necessity
“decontextualised” to be able to capture
generalizations (Calzolari et al. 2002) and corpus
annotation, on the other, where “contextualization”
plays a predominant role and, consequently,
figurative senses, idioms, metaphorical usages,
multiwords, are highly frequent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991267">
3.4 High granularity of sense distinctions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912173913044">
One of the main reasons for disagreement
between annotators could arise from the high IWN
granularity in sense distinction. Often, when
deciding a sense, too subtle distinctions could turn
out to be a disadvantage for the annotators.
Consider the verb sentire (to hear): IWN makes a
very fine-grained distinction, where exactly 17
senses are available. Some of them overlap or are
so close each other to be undistinguishable for
human annotators and may be problematic for
systems. In the following example:
Passano pochissimi secondi e qualcuno sente un
urlo= ... and someone hears a cry
In IWN, two senses of the verb are overlapping:
sentire 1 – percepire con l&apos;orecchio (to hear)
sentire 2 – essere in grado di percepire suoni con
l&apos;orecchio (to be able to hear sounds)
These distinctions are too subtle to be used in
corpus annotation. The annotator has chosen
sense1, but (in order to allow for the coarse-
grained scoring of automatic annotation) a
sensemap of words, a table where the overlapping
senses are accounted for, was provided.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994057">
3.5 Context Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999136814814815">
Corpus annotation strategy allowed to handle
cases where synsets are numerous and present fine-
grained distinctions, not easily mappable to the
corpus contexts or cases in which the context could
raise a double interpretation. Annotators were not
forced to make a totally subjective choice and
could assign multiple senses (‘and’ operator).
Lo Zaire è uno dei paesi più pericolosi di tutta
l&apos;Africa = The Zaire is one of the most dangerous
countries of Africa
In IWN, sense distinctions are as follows:
Paese1– territorio con un governo sovrano e una
propria organizzazione politica e amministrativa,
(territory with its own political and administrative
organization)
Paese3– insieme di individui legati da stesse
tradizioni storiche, lingua, costumi, (group of
people with same historical traditions, languages
and customs)
Since annotators could not achieve a satisfactory
disambiguation, they take into account both senses,
sense1 and sense3. It was not clear, indeed, if the
dangerousness refers to the country (sense1) or to
the people (sense3). During the annotation,
multiple senses have been assigned to about 90
lemmas, that appeared arbitrary or impossible to
disambiguate.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986747">
3.6 Multiwords annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959131147541">
The main difference between Senseval-3 and
Senseval-2 is that in the all-words annotation task
annotators are faced with complex lexical items
coined, generally, with many technical terms,
collocations, idioms, compounds, frozen
expressions or multiwords, which were not present
in the lexical-sample task. With the term
multiwords we refer to all sequences of words
whose meaning cannot be built compositionally
from the meanings of its component words. The
semantic contribution of individual components if
annotated separately does not give reason of the
final meaning of the expression which can be
considered a sort of “new concept”, e.g. farla
franca (to get away with it), prendere parte (to
take part), muro a secco (dry-stone wall).
In IWN a set of lexicalised expressions were
already included and the correct sense to assign
was, hence, available: perdere i sensi (to faint),
fare fuoco (to fire), passare in rivista (to review)
etc. Many multiword expressions found in the
corpus were added to IWN as semantically
complex units, e.g. vedersela brutta (to have a
narrow escape), essere in corso (to be in progress)
etc. The annotation task has given, hence, the
opportunity to establish a strong interaction
between annotators and lexicographers in deciding
what kind of sequences were real multiword
expressions and, above all, which were worthwhile
from a linguistic point of view to introduce in the
lexical resource.
The multiword expressions (about 60) were
annotated with the following information:
multiword ID; Part_of_Speech lemma; function of
the components words: head, satellite.
The individuation of the headword of the
sequence has been made on the basis of a lexical
criterion: for noun-phrases, the head of the
sequence was considered the noun, the adjective
for adjectival–phrases, the verb for verb-phrases.
Once recognized the head, the other constituents
play the role of satellites and the whole sequence
receives the part-of-speech of the head.
Here is an example encoded in XML:
&lt;head id=&amp;quot;cs.morph074.mw_704&amp;quot;
sats=&amp;quot;cs.morph074.mw_706
cs.morph074.mw_707&amp;quot;&gt;
uscita&lt;/head&gt;clamorosamente
&lt;sat id=&amp;quot;cs.morph074.mw_706&amp;quot;&gt;di&lt;/sat&gt;
&lt;sat id=&amp;quot;cs.morph074.mw_707&amp;quot;&gt;scena&lt;/sat&gt;
&lt;answer head=&amp;quot;cs.morph074.mw_704&amp;quot;
senseid=&amp;quot;uscire di scena.V.1&amp;quot;/&gt;
Our intention was only to provide an
examplification of the methodology we adopted
when trying to handle multiword expressions.
Even if the recognition and treatment of poly-
lexical units is obviously one of the most important
issues emerging in the process of context
interpretation, in this paper we did not address
theoretical issues concerning their exact
identification.
