In an effort to develop measures of discourse
level management strategies, this study examines
a measure of the degree to which decision-
making interactions consist of sequences of
utterance functions that are linked in a decision-
making routine. The measure is applied to 100
dyadic interactions elicited in both face-to-face
and computer-mediated environments with
systematic variation of task complexity and
message-window size. Every utterance in the
interactions is coded according to a system that
identifies decision-making functions and other
routine functions of utterances. Markov
analyses of the coded utterances make it possible
to measure the relative frequencies with which
sequences of 2 and 3 utterances trace a path in
a Markov model of the decision routine. These
proportions suggest that interactions in all
conditions adhere to the model, although we find
greater conformity in the computer-mediated
environments, which is probably due to
increased processing and attentional demands for
greater efficiency. The results suggest that
measures based on Markov analyses of coded
interactions can provide useful measures for
comparing discourse level properties, for
correlating discourse features with other textual
features, and for analyses of discourse
management strategies.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999063461538461">
Increasingly, research in computational
linguistics has contributed to knowledge about
the organization and processing of human
interaction through quantitative analyses of
annotated texts and dialogues (e.g. Carletta et
al., 1997; Cohen et al., 1990; Maier et al.,
1997; Nakatani et al., 1995; Passonneau,
1996; Walker, 1996). This program of
research presents opportunities to examine the
relation between linguistic form and pragmatic
functions using large corpora to test
hypotheses and to detect covariance among
discourse features. For example, Di Eugenio
et al. (1997) demonstrate that utterances
coded as acceptances were more likely to
corefer to an item in a previous turn. Grosz
and Hirschberg (1992) investigate intonational
correlates of discourse structure. These
researchers recognize that discourse-level
structures and strategies influence syntactic
and phonological encoding. The regularities
observed can be exploited to resolve language
processing problems such as ambiguity and
coreference, to integrate high level planning
with encoding and interpretation strategies, or
to refine statistics-based systems.
In order to identify and utilize discourse-
based structures and strategies, researchers
need methods of linking observable forms with
discourse functions, and our focus on
discourse management strategies has
motivated similar goals. Condon &amp; eech
(1996a,b) use annotated decision-making
interactions to investigate properties of
discourse routines and to examine the effects
of communication features such as screen size
on computer-mediated interactions (tech &amp;
Condon, 1997). In this paper we present a
method for measuring the degree to which an
</bodyText>

interaction conforms to a discourse routine,
which not only allows more refined analyses of
routine behavior, but also permits fine-grained
comparison of discourses obtained under
different conditions.
In our research, discourse routines have
emerged as a fundamental strategy for managing
verbal interaction, resulting in the kind of
behavior that researchers label adjacency pairs
such as question/answer or request/compliance
as well as more complex sequences of functions.
Discourse routines occur when a particular act
or function is routinely continued by another,
and as &amp;quot;predictable defaults,&amp;quot; routine
continuations maximize efficiency by requiring
minimal encoding while receiving highest
priority among possible interpretations.
Moreover, discourse routines can be exploited
by failing to conform to routine expectations
(Schegloff, 1986). Consequently, interactions
will not necessarily conform to routines at every
opportunity, which raises the problem of
measuring the extent to which they do conform.
Condon et al. (1997) develop a measure
based on Markov analyses of coded interactions,
and the measure is employed here with a larger
corpus in which students engage in a more
complex decision-making task. These measures
provide evidence for the claim that participants
in computer-mediated decision-making
interactions rely on a simple decision routine
more than participants in face-to-face decision-
making interactions. The measures suggest that
conformity to the routine is not strongly affected
by any of the other variables examined in the
study (task complexity, screen size), even
though some participants in the computer-
mediated conditions of the more complex task
adopted turn management strategies that would
be untenable in face-to-face interaction.

Data Collection

<bodyText confidence="0.99935292">
The initial corpus of 32 interactions involving
simple decision-making tasks was obtained
under conditions which were similar, but not
identical, to the conditions under which the 68
interactions involving a more complex task
were obtained. One obvious difference is that
participants in the first study completed 2
simple tasks planning a social event (a getaway
weekend, a barbecue), while participants in the
second study completed a single, more
complex task: planning a televised ceremony
to present the MTV music video awards.
Furthermore, all interactions in the first study
were mixed sex pairs, whereas interactions in
the MTV study include mixed and same sex
pairs. All participants were native English
speakers at the University of Southwestern
Louisiana who received credit in Introductory
Psychology classes for their participation.
In both studies, the dyads who interacted
face-to-face sat together at a table with a tape
recorder, while the pairs who interacted
electronically were seated at microcomputers
in separate rooms. The latter communicated
by typing messages which appeared on the
sender&apos;s monitor as they were typed, but did
not appear on the receiver&apos;s monitor until the
sender pressed a SEND key. The software
incorporated this feature to provide well-
defined turns and to make it possible to
capture and change messages in future studies.
In addition, to minimize message permanence
and more closely approximate face-to-face
interaction, text on the screen is always
produced by only one participant at a time.
In the original study, the message area
was approximately 4 lines long, and it was not
clear how much this factor influenced our
results. Consequently, in the MTV study, the
message area of the screen was either 4, 10, or
18 lines. Other differences in the computer-
mediated conditions of the two studies include
differences in the arrangement of information
on the screen such as a brief description of the
MTV problem which remained at the bottom
of the screen. We also used an answer form in
the first study, but not the second. More
details about the communication systems in the
two studies are provided Condon &amp; tech
(1996a) and tech &amp; Condon (1998).

Data Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98228476">
Face-to-face interactions were transcribed from
audio recordings into computer files using a set
of conventions established in a training manual
(Condon &amp; tech, 1992). All interactions were
divided into utterance units defined as single
clauses with all complements and adjuncts,
including sentential complements and
subordinate clauses. Interjections like yeah, now,
well, and ok were considered to be separate
utterances due to the salience of their
interactional, as opposed to propositional,
content.
The coding system includes categories for
request routines and a decision routine involving
3 acts or functions (Condon, 1986; Condon &amp;
tech, 1996a,b). We believe that the decision
routine observed in the interactions instantiates
a more general schema for decision-making that
may be routinized in various ways. In the
abstract schema, each decision has a goal;
proposals to satisfy the goal must be provided;
these proposals must be evaluated, and there
must be conventions for determining, from the
evaluations, whether the proposals are adopted
as decisions. Routines make it possible to map
from the general schema to sequences of routine
utterance functions. Default principles
associated with routines can determine the
encoding of these routine functions in sequences
of utterances.
According to the model we are developing,
a sequence of routine continuations is mapped
into a sequence of adjacent utterances in one-to-
one fashion by default. If the routine specifies
that a routine continuation must be provided by
a different speaker, as in adjacency pairs, then
the default is for the different speaker to produce
the routine continuation immediately after the
first pair-part. Since these are defaults, we can
expect that they may be weakened or overridden
in specific circumstances. At the same time, if
our reasoning is correct, we should be able to
find evidence of routines operating in the manner
we have described.

Coded as &amp;quot;Orients Suggestion,&amp;quot; orientations,
like (1a,2a) establish goals for each decision,
while suggestions like (1b,e) and (2b,e,h)
formulate proposals within these constraints.
Agreements like (1c,f) and (2c,f), which are
coded &amp;quot;Agrees with Suggestion,&amp;quot; and
disagreements (&amp;quot;Disagrees with Suggestion&amp;quot;)
evaluate a proposal and establish consensus.
The routine does not specify that a suggestion
which routinely continues an orientation must
be produced by a different speaker: the
suggestion may be elicited from a different
speaker, as in (1a,b) and (2d,e) or it may be
provided by the same speaker, as in (1d,e) and
(2a,b). However, an agreement that routinely
continues a suggestion is produced by a
different speaker, as (1b,c), (1 e,f), (2b,c) and
(2e,f) attest.
Other routine functions are also classified
in the coding system. Utterances coded as
&amp;quot;Requests Action&amp;quot; propose behaviors in the

Utterances coded as &amp;quot;Requests Information&amp;quot;
seek information not already provided in the
discourse, as in (1a,2a). Utterances that seek
confirmation or verification of provided
information, however, are coded as &amp;quot;Requests
Validation.&amp;quot; The category &amp;quot;Elaborates-
Repeats&amp;quot; serves as a catch-all for utterances
with comprehensible content that do not
function as requests or suggestions or as
responses to these.
Two categories are included to assess
affective functions: &amp;quot;Requests/Offers Personal
Information&amp;quot; for personal comments not
required to complete the task and &amp;quot;Jokes
Exaggerates&amp;quot; for utterances that inject humor.
The category &amp;quot;Discourse Marker&amp;quot; is used for a
limited set of forms: Ok, well, anyway, so, now,
let&apos;s see, and alright. Another category,
Metalanguage, was used to code utterances
about the talk such as (3b,c).
In the initial corpus, the categories
described above are organized into 3 classes:
MOVE, RESPONSE, and OTHER, and each
utterance was assigned a function in each of
these three groups of categories. In cases
involving no clear function in a class, the
utterance was assigned a No Clear code. A
complete list of categories is presented at the
bottom of Figure 1 and more complete
descriptions can be found in Condon and Cech
(1992). In the modified system used to code the
MTV corpus, the criteria for classifying all of
these categories remain the same.
The data were coded by students who
received course credit as research assistants.
Coders were trained by coding and discussing
excerpts from the data. Reliability tests were
administered frequently during the coding
process. Reliability scores were high (80-100%
agreement with a standard) for frequently
occurring move and response functions,
discourse markers, and the two categories
designed to identify affective functions. Scores
for infrequent move and response functions,
In the initial study, the 16 face-to-face
interactions produced a corpus of 4141
utterances (ave. 259 per discourse), while the
16 computer-mediated interactions consisted
of 918 utterances (ave. 57). In the MTV
study, the 8 face-to-face interactions produced
3593 utterances (ave. 449), the 20
interactions in the 4-line condition included
2556 utterances (ave. 128), the 20 interactions
in the 10-line condition produced 3041
utterances (ave. 152) and the 20 interactions in
the 18-line condition included 2498 utterances
(ave. 125). Clearly, completing the more
complex MTV task required more talk.
Figure 1 presents proportions of utterance
functions averaged per interaction for each
modality in the initial study. Analyses of
variance that treated discourse (dyad) as the
random variable were performed on the data
within each of the three broad categories,
excluding the No Clear MOVE/RESPONSE/
OTHER functions where inclusion would
force levels of the between-discourse factor to
the same value. We found no significant effect
of problem type or order (for details see
Condon &amp; Cech, 1996). However, the
interaction of function type with discourse
modality was significant at the .001-level for
all three (MOVE, RESPONSE, OTHER)
function classes. Tests of simple effects of
modality type for each function indicated that
only four proportions were identical in the two
modalities: Requests Validation in the MOVE
class, Disagrees in the RESPONSE class, and,
in the OTHER class, Personal Information and
Jokes-Exaggerates.
Figure 2 presents the proportions of
utterance functions for the MTV corpus using
the same categories of functions as in Figure 1.
The similarity of the results in the two figures
is remarkable, especially considering
differences in methods of data collection
described above. First, it can be observed that

the screen size in the MTV -condition did not
influence the proportions of functions in the 4-
line and 18-line conditions. The results in both
those conditions are nearly identical. Second,
similar differences are obtained between face-to-
face and computer-mediated conditions in both
corpora. For example, all of the computer-
mediated interactions produced suggestions at
a proportion of approximately .3, while the face-
to-face interactions produced suggestions at
closer to half that frequency. Similar patterns of
difference between face-to-face and computer-
mediated conditions occur in both corpora for
the 3 types of requests in the coding system,
too.
We anticipated an increase in discourse
management functions due to the complexity
of the task, and the increase in metalanguage
from .05 to .15 in the face-to-face conditions
suggests that the more complex task pressured
participants to engage in more explicit
management strategies. In the computer-
mediated interactions, the proportion of
functions coded as metalanguage also
increases with the complexity of the task,
though not as much. The greater proportion
of discourse markers in the computer-mediated
interactions also reflects an increase in
discourse management activity for the more
complex task.
The failure to observe an increase in the
proportion of utterances coded as &amp;quot;Orients
Suggestion&amp;quot; in the MTV interactions is
probably a result of the emergence of a turn
strategy not observed in the interactions with
simpler decision-making tasks. Specifically,
while all of the computer-mediated interactions
in the initial study and many of the computer-
mediated interactions in the MTV study

consisted of relatively short turns, some of the
latter display a strategy of employing long turns
in which participants encode routine functions
for several decisions in the same turn, as in (4).

Dione&apos;s song I&apos;ts all coming back to me or the other

could use the clip of her playing the guitar in the
bathroom. We need one more female singer. Did we
pick who should present the award? I think Bush
should play after the award.
These more parallel management strategies can
reduce the number of orientations if a single
orientation can hold for several suggestions and
a single agreement can accept them all, Of
course, this is exactly what happens when
participants provide a list of suggestions in a
short turn, too. Therefore, the parallel strategy
is a minor modification of the decision routine,
but it may influence the proportions of routine
functions by reducing the number of orientations
and agreements.
In fact, the proportions of utterances coded
as &amp;quot;Agrees with Suggestion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Complies
with Request&amp;quot; are lower in the computer-
mediated MTV interactions than in the
computer-mediated interactions of the initial
corpus. Though these proportions are still
slightly higher than those in the face-to-face
MTV condition, preserving the pattern observed
in the initial corpus, the differences are smaller.
These differences are reflected even more
dramatically if we compare the ratios of
suggestions to agreements in the MTV corpus.
At approximately 1.5, the ratio of suggestions to
agreements in the face-to-face condition of the
MTV study resembles the ratio in the face-to-
face condition of the earlier study (1.64).
Similarly, the ratio of suggestions to agreements
in the computer-mediated interactions of the
original study is 1.71. In contrast, the ratios of
suggestions to agreements in the 4- and 18-line
conditions of the MTV corpus are much larger,
both at approximately 2.5. We believe that
much of the difference observed is the result of
longer turns employing parallel decision
management in the MTV corpus.
These results raise the question of the
extent to which the interactions conform to a
model of the decision routine we have
described. The measure developed in Condon
et al. (1997) begins by combining the 3 code
annotations as a triple and treating those
triples as the output of a probabilistic source.
Then 0-, 1- and 2nd-order Markov analyses
are performed on the resulting sequences of
triples. While the 0-order analyses simply give
the proportions of each triple in the
interactions, the 1st-order analyses make it
possible to examine adjacent pairs of triples to
determine the probability that a particular
combination of functions will be followed by
another particular combination of functions.
Similarly, the 2nd-order analyses examine
sequences of 3 utterances.

either orientations, suggestions or agreements,
but the 1&amp;quot;- and 2&apos;-order analyses make it
possible to examine the extent to which pairs
and sequences of 3 utterances conform to the
model in Figure 3. Table 1 presents the results
of obtaining the measure just described from the
initial corpus of face-to-face and computer-
mediated interactions. The proportions therefore
reflect the average (and standard deviation) per
discourse of events that conform to a sequence
of routine continuations in Figure 3.
Since conforming to the model is less and
less likely as more functions are linked in
sequence, it is not surprising that the proportions
decrease as the order of the Markov analysis
increases. Still, it is encouraging that the
proportions of routine continuations in the 1st-
order analyses are approximately equal to the
proportions of suggestions in the two types of
interactions, since the latter provide an
estimate of the number of opportunities to
engage in the routine.
Table 2 presents the results of computing
the same analyses on the face-to-face, 4-line,
10-line, and 18-line computer-mediated
interactions in the MTV corpus. The 0-order
results are much the same for both corpora
with about 1/3 of the utterances in face-to-face
interactions functioning in the decision routine
compared to 1/2 in the computer-mediated
interactions. Similarly, proportions of
utterance pairs that conform to the routine
remain fairly close to the proportions of
suggestions in each condition. Screen size
appears to have no effect on the results
obtained with this measure.

The results are promising both as evidence for
our theory of routines and as an initial attempt
to devise a measure of conformity to routines.
In particular, the fact that an additional corpus
with a more complex task has provided
measures which are very similar to those
obtained in the initial corpus increases our
confidence that these methods are tapping into
some stable phenomena. Moreover, the
similarities of the conformity measures in

of new computer-mediated discourse
management strategies in which long turns
encode decision sequences in parallel. Though
these strategies seem to have a strong effect on
the ratio of suggestions to agreements in the
computer-mediated interactions of the MTV
corpus, the conformity measures are still quite
similar to the measures obtained in the
computer-mediated interactions of the initial
study.
The MTV data also confirm the result
obtained in the original study that computer-
mediated interactions rely more heavily on
routines than face-to-face interactions. The
much higher conformity measures for all three
Markov orders provide clear evidence for this
claim with respect to the decision routine.
Moreover, a comparison of Figures 1 and 2
shows that the computer-mediated interactions
have higher proportions of requests, especially
requests for information. If these proportions
are indicative of the extent to which request
routines are relied on in the interactions, then
these data also support the claim that computer-
mediated interactions rely on discourse routines
more than face-to-face interactions. Given our
claims about the effectiveness of discourse
routines, it makes sense that participants in an
unfamiliar communication environment will
employ their most efficient strategies.
The conformity measure that has been
devised does not make use of all the information
available in the Markov analyses, and we
continue to experiment with different measures.
It seems clear that Markov analyses can provide
sensitive measures that will be useful for
identifying differences between interactions and
for measuring the effects of experimental factors
on interactions.

<abstract confidence="0.999619">effort to develop measures of discourse level management strategies, this study examines a measure of the degree to which decisionmaking interactions consist of sequences of utterance functions that are linked in a decisionmaking routine. The measure is applied to 100 dyadic interactions elicited in both face-to-face and computer-mediated environments with systematic variation of task complexity and message-window size. Every utterance in the interactions is coded according to a system that identifies decision-making functions and other routine functions of utterances. Markov of the utterances make it possible to measure the relative frequencies with which sequences of 2 and 3 utterances trace a path in a Markov model of the decision routine. These proportions suggest that interactions in all conditions adhere to the model, although we find greater conformity in the computer-mediated environments, which is probably due to increased processing and attentional demands for greater efficiency. The results suggest that measures based on Markov analyses of coded interactions can provide useful measures for comparing discourse level properties, for correlating discourse features with other textual features, and for analyses of discourse management strategies.</abstract>

The results suggest that measures based on Markov analyses of coded interactions can provide useful measures for comparing discourse level properties, for correlating discourse features with other textual features, and for analyses of discourse management strategies. Introduction Increasingly, research in computational linguistics has contributed to knowledge about the organization and processing of human interaction through quantitative analyses of annotated texts and dialogues (e.g. Carletta et al., 1997; Cohen et al., 1990; Maier et al., 1997; Nakatani et al., 1995; Passonneau, 1996; Walker, 1996). This program of research presents opportunities to examine the relation between linguistic form and pragmatic functions using large corpora to test hypotheses and to detect covariance among discourse features. For example, Di Eugenio et al. (1997) demonstrate that utterances coded as acceptances were more likely to corefer to an item in a previous turn.

Discourse routines occur when a particular act or function is routinely continued by another, and as &amp;quot;predictable defaults,&amp;quot; routine continuations maximize efficiency by requiring minimal encoding while receiving highest priority among possible interpretations. Moreover, discourse routines can be exploited by failing to conform to routine expectations (Schegloff, 1986). Consequently, interactions will not necessarily conform to routines at every opportunity, which raises the problem of measuring the extent to which they do conform. Condon et al. (1997) develop a measure based on Markov analyses of coded interactions, and the measure is employed here with a larger corpus in which students engage in a more complex decision-making task. These measures provide evidence for the claim that participants in computer-mediated decision-making interactions rely on a simple decision routine more than participants in face-to-face decisionmaking interactions. The measures suggest that conformity to the routine is not strongly affected by any of the other variables examined in the study (task complexity, screen size), even though some participants in the </context>

Similarly, the ratio of suggestions to agreements in the computer-mediated interactions of the original study is 1.71. In contrast, the ratios of suggestions to agreements in the 4- and 18-line conditions of the MTV corpus are much larger, both at approximately 2.5. We believe that much of the difference observed is the result of longer turns employing parallel decision management in the MTV corpus. These results raise the question of the extent to which the interactions conform to a model of the decision routine we have described. The measure developed in Condon et al. (1997) begins by combining the 3 code annotations as a triple and treating those triples as the output of a probabilistic source. Then 0-, 1- and 2nd-order Markov analyses are performed on the resulting sequences of triples. While the 0-order analyses simply give the proportions of each triple in the interactions, the 1st-order analyses make it possible to examine adjacent pairs of triples to determine the probability that a particular combination of functions will be followed by another particular combination of functions. Similarly, the 2nd-order analyses examine sequences of 3 utterances. Aft. Or</context>
