As a user interacts with a database or expert system,
s/he may reveal a misconception about the objects modeled
by the system. This paper discusses the ROMPER system for
responding to such misconceptions in a domain independent
and context sensitive fashion. ROMPER reasons about possible
sources of the misconception. It operates on a model of the user
and generates a cooperative response based on this reasoning.
The process is made context sensitive by augmenting the user
model with a new notion of object perspective which highlights
certain aspects of the user model due to previous discourse.

A study of transcripts of expert-user dialogues reveals
that users often exhibit misconceptions about the objects mod-
eled in a domain. This paper describes the ROMPER system
(Responding to Object-Related Misconceptions using PERspec-
tive) which is able to respond to certain classes of these mis-
conceptions in a principled manner. In doing so the system
sheds light not only on the process of correcting misconcep-
tions, but also on issues in natural-language generation, user
models, and modeling certain contextual effects by a &amp;quot;filtering&amp;quot;
of the knowledge representation.
The ROMPER system functions as a part of a natural-
language interface to a database or expert system. Input to
ROMPER is a specification that a misconception has been de-
tected. In this work a misconception is defined to be some
discrepancy between what the system believes (i.e., what is con-
tained in the system knowledge base) and what the user believes
(as exhibited through the conversation). The system knowledge
base includes an object taxonomy and knowledge about object
attributes and their possible values.
Several factors may influence the structure and content
of responses to queries that reveal misconceptions. These in-
clude the goals of the conversational participants. If the mis-
conception is not important to these goals, the response may
not address the misconception or may address it only mini-
mally. ROMPER is concerned with correcting misconceptions
that are important to the current goals of the conversational
participants and is thus concerned with generating a maximal

response. This response is aimed at eliminating the discrepancy
between what the user believes and what the system believes
by bringing the user&apos;s knowledge into line with the system&apos;s.
This means that the system must not only give the user the
correct information, but must present it in such a way so as
to have the user adopt that information. ROMPER has a user
model available to aid in this task. The user model constitutes
what the system believes the user believes about the domain. It
contains the same kind of information as is contained in the sys-
tem&apos;s knowledge base â€” an object taxonomy and information
about objects&apos; attributes and their values. The content of the
user model, however, may be very different from the content of
the system&apos;s knowledge base. For instance, it may contain less
information than is contained in the system knowledge base,
or it may contain some information that is inconsistent with
the system knowledge base. The user model will not, how-
ever, contain more information than is contained in the system
knowledge base since the system is assumed to be an expert in
the domain.
In an attempt to respond to a misconception in a natural
way, the system operates on the model of the user attempting
to find certain structural configurations which might indicate
support for the misconception. If one of the configurations is
found, then a response is generated that refutes the found sup-
port. ROMPER is specifically concerned with responding to
two kinds of misconceptions: those involving an object&apos;s clas-
sification (which I call misclassifications) and those involving
an objects attributes (which I call misattributions). Certain
structural configurations have been identified indicating pos-
sible support for both kinds of misconceptions. Each identi-
fied configuration has a response strategy associated with it
which may be instantiated to respond to the misconception.
The whole process is made context sensitive by a new notion
of object perspective which acts to filter the user model, high-
lighting those aspects which are made important by previous
dialogue, while suppressing others. The filtering gained by ob-
ject perspective allows the same misconception by the same user
to be responded to differently in different contextual situations.
Output from ROMPER is a formal specification of a re-
sponse. This specification is then input to the MUMBLE sys-
tem [McD801 which, using a dictionary and grammer supplied
by Robin Karlin [Kar85], produces actual English text.

2 Misconception Responses

The view of natural-language generation taken in this
system is the same as that taken in [McK82]. The generation
process is seen as consisting of two parts: (1) determining the
content and structure of the response and producing a formal
message specification, and (2) transforming that specification
into actual English text. My work has concentrated on deter-
mining the content and structure of a response to a misconcep-
tion. It attempts to automate the process of deciding what in-
formation to include in a response to a misconception by giving
the system the ability to reason about certain classes of miscon-
ceptions and typical ways of correcting misconceptions in one
of the identified classes. This should be contrasted with the a
priori listing of misconceptions and responses found in most
existing systems that handle misconceptions ([SC80], [BB78],
and [Woo84]).2
The form of the responses generated by ROMPER de-
rived from an analysis of transcripts of human conversational
partners. These transcripts revealed that responses to state-
ments containing misconceptions often include more than a sim-
ple denial of the wrong information. This is particularly true in
circumstances where the misconception is about something im-
portant to the current goals of the participants. In addition to
denying the information involved in the misconception, many
misconception responses include both the corresponding cor-
rect information, and additional justification for the denial and
correction given. The justification often involves refuting faulty
reasoning that may have led the user to the misconception.
While it may seem that the kinds of faulty reasoning that
the user may be using to arrive at a misconception are limitless,
the transcript analysis revealed a surprisingly small number of
misconception support relations that are refuted by the human
experts. In addition, these few misconception support relations
can be couched in terms of a knowledge base (KB) structure
rather than its content. Thus a system reasoning on a model of
the user might look for such relations in a domain independent
fashion. If one is found, information refuting the misconception
support might be included in the corrective response.
To see this, let us examine the number of ways that a
human expert was found to correct one of the misconception
types handled by ROMPER: misclassifications. The strategies
used by the human experts to respond to a misclassification
can be exemplified by the number of possible responses to the
following misconception:
U. I thought whales were fish.
RI. No, they are mammals. You may have thought they were
fish because they are fin-bearing and live in the water.
However, they are mammals since, (while fish have gills)
whales breathe through lungs and feed their young with
[Woo84] represents a departure from the canned response in that she
is concerned with appropriately structuring a response to reflect a certain
tutoring style.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.631272833333333">
R2. No, they are mammals. You may have thought they were
fish since they are like the fish, sharks, in that both are
large aquatic creatures and both scare people. However,
whales are mammals since, (while fish have gills) whales
breathe through lungs and feed their young with milk.
R3. No, they are mammals.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859576923077">
Before analyzing each one of these in detail, let us first
note their similarities. Each of the above strategies can be seen
as consisting of three parts: (1) a denial of the incorrect clas-
sification, (2) a statement of the correct classification, and (3)
an offering of justification for the denial/correction pair. This
three part strategy is, in fact, typical of all of the responses
found in the transcript analysis. Notice that the denial of the
incorrect information and the offering of the corresponding cor-
rect information is the same in each of the sample responses
given. What distinguishes one kind of response strategy from
another is the kind of justification given in each case. Responses
R1 and R2 offer two different kinds of justification while R3 of-
fers no justification.
Given that examples of each of the above three kinds
of responses were found in the transcripts, we must ask what
causes one to be used in preference to another in a particular
situation. One explanation is that different beliefs about what
the user believes trigger the use of each strategy. Notice that
each strategy can be seen as refuting a different kind of support
for the misconception. My claim is that a speaker may choose
a strategy depending on the support that he/she believes the
user may be using to come up with the misconception. Let us
take each strategy in turn, examine what beliefs might have
led to the use of that strategy, and then investigate how this
information might be used by a system to generate responses
to misconceptions.

3 Using Response Strategies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983133333333">
The justification in R1 consists in the expert conceding
properties that whales have in common with fish (fin-bearing
and water-living), and overriding that conceded information
with properties that distinguish whales from fish. The use of
this strategy by an expert might be explained by the expert be-
lieving that the user believes that whales and fish are similar,
and that that similarity may have led to the misclassification.
An expert having these beliefs might very well find it reason-
able to concede that the similarity between whales and fish does
indeed exist, but then go on to show that that similarity is not
enough to classify whales as fish. S/he may do this, as above,
by offering properties that make whales mammals instead of
fish.
Given that this analysis might explain a human&apos;s re-
sponse to a misconception, we might have a computer system

adopt this strategy to respond to a misconception in a natu-
ral way. First, the information included in a response like R1
can be captured in a response schema as shown below. RI can
be seen as an instantiation of this schema where OBJECT is
instantiated with whale, POSITED with fish, and REAL with
mammal. The shared attributes are instantiated in the obvious
way.

<figure confidence="0.964016363636364">

REAL
ATTRIBUTES3)))
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999179104166667">
The above schema is called the &amp;quot;like-super&amp;quot; schema be-
cause it is used by ROMPER when the user exhibits a miscon-
ception by wrongly classifying some OBJECT as a POSITED
superordinate and when ROMPER determines that a probable
reason for the misclassification is that the user believes that the
OBJECT and the POSITED superordinate are similar to each
other. The schema captures a response like RI by specifying a
denial of the incorrect classification, a statement of the correct
classification, and then an offering of justification. The justifi-
cation is in the form of conceding the similarity that may have
led to the misclassification (e.g., the shared attributes), but
overriding that conceded information with attributes that are
not shr-ed by the OBJECT and the POSITED superordinate
but instead distinguish the two.
It should be pointed out that this schema encodes two
kinds of information: a domain-independent specification of the
content of each proposition included in the response (e.g., an
object classification or shared attributes between objects), as
well as information about the rhetorical force or communica-
tive role played by each proposition (e.g., a denial or state-
ment or conceded information). The content specification is
derived from the transcript analysis. The rhetorical force is
derived from both the transcript analysis and from work done
by [McK82], [MT83j, and [Man841 who have developed theo-
ries about the role that a proposition can play in a discourse.
The goal in using such a schema is to have a specification of a
response that may be filled in with information from the user
model and that, when instantiated, contains enough rhetori-
cal information to be turned into a cohesive English text by
a tactical component. The schema above meets both of these
requirements.
The justification included in R2 is also in the form of a
concede/override pair. However, in the case of R2, rather than
concede a similarity between whales and all fish, a similarity
between whales and some subset of fish (i.e., the sharks) is
conceded. The use of this response might be explained by the
expert believing that the user believes whales and sharks to be
similar and salient at this point in the discourse. The expert
might imagine the user to have reasoned: &amp;quot;I don&apos;t know how to
classify whales, but I do know that they are similar to sharks
and I know that sharks are fish. Perhaps whales are fish as
well.&amp;quot;
This analysis was used in developing ROMPER by asso-
ciating a schema based on responses like R2 with a user model
configuration showing a similarity between the misclassified ob-
ject and some descendent of the posited superordinate. The
schema is termed the &amp;quot;like-some-super&amp;quot; schema and is shown
below:

<bodyText confidence="0.9910962">
Response R3 can be thought of as the degenerate strat-
egy since it contains no justification for the denial/correction
pair. ROMPER instantiates the schema corresponding to R3
when neither of the two above mentioned knowledge base con-
figurations can be found in the user model.
So far this paper has concentrated on misclassifications.
ROMPER also handles misconceptions involving an object&apos;s
attributes. The transcript analysis revealed three correction
strategies for misattributions as exemplefied by the following
responses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9507065">
U. What is the interest rate on this stock?
R4. Stock doesn&apos;t have an interest rate. Were you thinking of
a bond?

dend?
R6. Stock doesn&apos;t have an interest rate.

<bodyText confidence="0.993618090909091">
ROMPER employs three correction schema to handle
misattributions; one for each of the response strategies shown.
114 can be seen as in instantiation of ROMPER&apos;s wrong-object
schema. This schema offers an object which has the attribute
involved in the misconception that the user may have either
confused with the misconception object or made a bad analogy
from. It is instantiated when an object is found that has the
attribute involved in the misattribution and is similar to the
misconception object.
R5 exemplifies the wrong-attribute schema which offers
an attribute that the object involved in the misconception does

have. This response is used when there is reason to believe
the user may have confused the attribute involved in the mis-
conception with a similar attribute that the object does have.
ROMPER uses the schema when the misconception object has
an attribute that is similar to the attribute involved in the mis-
conception.
As is the case with the misclassifications, there is a &amp;quot;de-
generate&amp;quot; schema for misattributions. This schema contains no
justification for the correction and is exemplified by R6.
In summary, a study of transcripts of humans responding
to misconceptions reveals a great deal of regularity in the way
misconceptions about objects are corrected. One can abstract
a small number of response strategies for each of the various
knowledge base features that might be involved in a misconcep-
tion. Each of these strategies can be seen as refuting a different
kind of support that the user may have for the information in-
volved in the misconception. These strategies are captured as
schemas in the ROMPER system and each schema is associated
with a domain independent description of the kind of support
it refutes. ROMPER, when faced with a misconception, oper-
ates on a model of the user looking for evidence for one of the
identified kinds of support. If enough evidence is found, the
response to the misconception is generated by instantiating the
corresponding schema.

4 Effects of Context
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999091964285715">
The above section outlined a method for correcting mis-
conceptions. While the method does seem to be appealing, at
first glance it seems to have a major flaw. It does not seem
to take into account the role that previous context plays in
correcting misconceptions. The responses given by the human
experts were very context dependent. In two different contexts
a human expert might choose to correct the same misconcep-
tion by the same user in two different ways. For example, in
response to the misconception exhibited by &amp;quot;I thought whales
were fish&amp;quot;, an expert might choose R1 in one context and R2
in another. How can this be explained if the process described
above is used to respond?
I claim that the process of correcting misconceptions is
context sensitive not because the process changes with context,
but because what the process works on changes with context. In
particular the piece of the user model that is analyzed in looking
for possible sources of the misconception changes with context.
Instead of doing the user model analysis on a flat representa-
tion containing everything that the user knows at equal levels
of importance, the analysis is done on a model that has been
highlighted by previous discourse. Previous discourse serves to
highlight certain aspects of the user model while suppressing
others. Different highlighting resulting from different previ-
ous discourse may cause the user model analysis to conclude
that different support had been used for the misconception and
therefore cause a different response strategy to be selected. Ob-
ject perspective is a notion which can be used to model this
contextual effect.

5 Object Perspective
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988551020408">
In this section I introduce a new notion of object per-
spective as an augmentation to a standard semantic network
representation. Before introducing this notion let us first ex-
amine what we want this notion to account for.
The notion of object perspective has previously been dis-
cussed in the literature. It can be likened to the &amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot;
one takes on an object in a particular discussion. From a partic-
ular point of view certain characteristics of the object seem more
important than others. For instance, a particular building may
be discussed from the point of view of being someones home on
the one hand, and from the completely different pont of view
of being an architectural work on the other. The two different
views of the same building cause different groups of attributes
to be important. It is this highlighting of a whole group of at-
tributes that must be explained. Notice that it could not be
explained by a focusing mechanism which highlights attributes
which have been mentioned in the preceding discourse because
many of the highlighted attributes may not have been explicitly
mentioned. What needs to be captured is the feeling that each
view calls to mind a &amp;quot;precompiled&amp;quot; set of attributes that seem
to be important while that view is in effect.
An attempt to explain this effect has been made by defin-
ing object perspective as viewing an object as a member of
one superordinate when, in fact, it may have many superordi-
notes ([Cro77], [BW77], and [TWF*82]). The highlighting is
achieved through a limited inheritance mechanism. An object
inherits only those attributes contributed by the one superordi-
nate deemed &amp;quot;in perspective&amp;quot;. Thus, when a building is viewed
as an architectural work, for example, it inherits only those at-
tributes associated with the concept architectural-work in the
generalization hierarchy. Any attributes that it might inherit
from other superordinates (e.g., home) are ignored. While this
notion is intuitively appealing, in practice it is problematic (see
[McC85] for details) and is unable to handle some additional ef-
fects which intuitively should be handled by object perspective.
Two of these effects will be discussed here.
During the course of a conversation it is usually the case
that more than one object will be discussed. When this hap-
pens, usually the same kinds of things are discussed about the
objects. In essence, a particular highlighting of attributes (or
point of view) seems to be in force during the conversation. Yet,
this highlighting is applied to different objects. What seems to
be happening is that the conversational partners are viewing an
entire group of objects from the same perspective. This cannot
be accounted for by the previous definition of object perspective
unless each of the objects under discussion can be said to have
the same superordinate.
A second effect which is not accounted for by the above
definition, yet seems to hinge on object perspective, has to do
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999979866666667">
with the heightened importance of some objects during a dis-
course. For instance, in the responses R1-R3 above, the correct
classification of whale was given as mammal. It is the case, how-
ever, that whales are cetaceans and cetaceans are mammals. If
the expert above thought that U. knew about cetaceans, why
wasn&apos;t cetaceans given as the correct classification? Since there
was no preceding discourse given in this case, some default con-
text would have to be in force. Apparently, in this context
cetacean did not seem important enough to mention. Yet in
other contexts, on can imagine cetacean being given as the cor-
rect classification even though it had not yet been explicitly
referred to in the preceding discourse. The importance of the
object cetacean seems to have something to do with the current
perspective from which objects are being viewed. The previous
definitions of object perspective do not address this issue.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985717">
5.1 Perspective: Definition and Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955054545455">
I claim that all of the above criteria can be met by a simple
notion of object perspective which has the following properties:
First, instead of tying perspective into the generalization
hierarchy of objects as has been done in the past, the new notion
of perspective will be independent of that hierarchy. &amp;quot;Perspec-
tives&amp;quot; which can be taken on the objects in the domain will be
defined and will sit in a structure which is orthogonal to the
generalization hierarchy.
Second, the number of such perspectives that need be
defined for the objects in a given domain of discourse is small
and finite. Moreover, any given domain object may be viewed
from any one of several perspectives defined for that domain. As
it turns out, it will make more sense to view some of the objects
in the domain through some perspectives and not others, but
this is a feature of perspectives which will be taken advantage
of later.
Third, each perspective comprises a set of attributes
with associated salience values. It is these salience values that
dictate which attributes are highlighted and which are sup-
pressed.
Fourth, one such perspective is designated active at a
particular point in the discourse.
This notion of object perspective works as follows. An
object or group of objects is still said to be viewed through
a perspective. In particular any object which is accessed by
the system is viewed through the current active perspective.
However, instead of dictating which attributes an object in-
herits, the active perspective affects the salience values of the
attributes that an object possesses (either directly or inherited
through the generalization hierarchy). The active perspective
essentially acts as a filter on an object&apos;s attributes â€” raising the
salience of and thus highlighting those attributes which have
a high salience rating in the active perspective, and lowering
the salience of and thus suppressing those attributes which are
either given a low salience value or do not appear in the active
perspective.
The importance of an object in a discourse is determined
by the salience values given to the attributes it possesses. The
idea is that the whole becomes highlighted by having its parts
highlighted. Thus, during a discussion in which the active per-
spective highlights many attributes contributed by the object
&amp;quot;cetacean&amp;quot; in our generalization hierarchy, cetacean will be seen
as an important object. If, on the other hand, none of the
attributes associated with cetacean are highlighted, then that
object will be suppressed.
This notion of object importance realizes the intuitive
notion that it makes &amp;quot;more sense&amp;quot; to view some objects through
particular perspectives than others. It makes more sense to
view an object through perspectives that highlight many of the
object&apos;s attributes and thereby make the object more domi-
nant. Notice that we can see a certain amount of symmetry
here. The perspective determines the salience of an object&apos;s
attributes and the object&apos;s importance; the object and its at-
tributes determines how likely the object is to be viewed from
a particular perspective.

5.2 Using Perspective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999811875">
A model of a particular domain would include the usual object
taxonomy containing all of the objects in the domain and all
of the attributes those objects possess. So in our fish-mammal
domain we would have sharks as a kind of fish with attributes
like &amp;quot;scare-people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;large-aquatic-creature&amp;quot;. In addition,
all of the attributes of fish would also be represented and sharks
would inherit those attributes as well.
In addition to the object taxonomy, we must build a sep-
arate structure containing the perspectives that can be taken on
the domain objects. One perspective we might imagine defining
for the fish-mammal domain would be the &amp;quot;body-characteristics&amp;quot;
perspective. In this perspective attributes like &amp;quot;fin-bearing&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;have-gills&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;breathe-through-lungs&amp;quot; would be given high
salience and thus highlighted. Other attributes would be sup-
pressed by this perspective.
Another perspective that might be defined for the fish-
mammal domain might be the &amp;quot;common-people&apos;s-perception&amp;quot;
perspective. This perspective might highlight attributes like
&amp;quot;large-aquatic-creatures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;scare-people&amp;quot;. Other attributes,
like &amp;quot;have-gills&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fin-bearing&amp;quot; might be suppressed by this
perspective.
ROMPER uses the highlighting from object perspective
in two ways. First, during the user model analysis it uses the
information to check for user model configurations which might
indicate particular kinds of support for a misconception. Sec-
tion 2 introduced two user model configurations which were
associated with response schemas. The like-super schema was
associated with a user model configuration that indicated that
the user believed the misclassified object was like the posited su-
perordinate. The like-some-super schema was associated with a
user model configuration that indicated that the user believed
the misclassified object was like some descendent of the posited

superordinate. Notice that both of these user model configu-
rations hinge on a similarity assessment between objects. The
similarity metric used by ROMPER is one that is based on the
objects&apos; common and disjoint attributes which takes attribute
salience into account [Tve77]. This metric will be discussed be-
low. Since the similarity metric takes attribute salience into
account and attribute salience is effected by object perspective,
the active perspective can influence the selection of a miscon-
ception response schema.
Second, ROMPER uses the highlighting from object per-
spective to instantiate the selected response schema. It at-
tempts to do this using only attributes deemed important by
the current perspective.

5.3 Object Similarity

<bodyText confidence="0.994135472222222">
As was mentioned above, the object similarity metric used by
ROMPER must be sensitive to context. To date, most Al sys-
tems that use object similarity use a metric that is based on
distance in the generalization hierarchy. Such a metric is not
context sensitive.
The ROMPER system uses a similarity metric based on
work done in [Tve77] which allows contextual information to be
taken into account. Tversky&apos;s metric, called a contrast model,
is based on the common and disjoint features/properties of the
objects involved. Suppose we have two objects a and b where
A is the set of properties associated with object a and B is the
set of properties associated with object b. Tversky&apos;s measure
can be expressed as:
s(a,b) = 0 f (A fl B) â€” a f (A â€” B) â€” pf(B â€” A)
for some 0,a, and # &gt; 0.
In the above equation 0, a, and # are parameters which
alter the importance of each piece of the equation. The function
f maps over the features and yields a salience rating for each.
In essence, the contrast model states that the similarity of two
objects is some function of their common features minus some
function of their disjoint features. The importance of each par-
ticular feature involved (determined by the function f) and the
importance of each piece of the equation (determined by 0,a,
and #) may change with context.
In order to use the metric, we must come up with values
for the functions in the equation. Tversky suggests that the
0,a, and 13 functions might be affected by the relative promi-
nence of objects a and b in the discourse. If a is relatively more
important, then function 0 and a should be greater than /3 re-
sulting in the attributes of the more prominent object having a
greater influence over the similarity assessment. While I would
conjecture that information about the focus of the discourse
[Gro81], [S1d83], [GJ W83] might give an indication of an ob-
ject&apos;s prominence and would therefore be useful in setting the
values of 0, a, and /3, in this work I have assumed a value of
1 for the 0, a, and # and have concentrated on setting the f
function.
In the ROMPER system the f function has been set us-
ing the salience values returned after the knowledge base has
been filtered through object perspective. Using this setting of
f the same two objects may be seen as very similar when the
active perspective highlights attributes that the objects have in
common and suppresses those that are disjoint between them.
On the other hand, the same two objects may be seen as very
different when the active perspective suppresses attributes that
they have in common and highlights those that are disjoint be-
tween them.
This similarity metric is used by ROMPER in deciding
which schema to use to respond to a particular misconception.
Suppose that ROMPER must respond to the misconception &amp;quot;I
thought a whale was a fish&amp;quot; when the active perspective is the
&apos;body-characteristics&apos; perspective defined above. Recall that
this perspective highlighted attributes like fin-bearing, have-
gills, and breathe-through-lungs. Under this perspective, at-
tributes common to whales and all fish are highlighted. Using
a Tversky-like similarity metric this highlighting causes whales
and fish to be seen as similar. ROMPER would thus respond
using the like-super schema producing a response similar to Rl.
If, on the other hand, the same misconception were
encountered when the perspective was &amp;quot;common-people&apos;s-
perception&amp;quot;, the attributes that whales and all fish have in com-
mon would not be highlighted. Rather, attributes like scare-
people and large-aquatic-creatures shared with just a subset of
fish, the sharks, would be highlighted. Under these conditions,
the similarity metric would return a low similarity rating for
whales and all fish (and thus the &amp;quot;like-super&amp;quot; schema would
not be applicable), but a high similarity rating for whales and
sharks. Thus, the &amp;quot;like-some-super&amp;quot; schema would be used to
produce a response similar to R2 above.
One can imagine how other perspectives might make nei-
ther the &amp;quot;like-super&amp;quot; nor the &amp;quot;like-some-super&amp;quot; schemes appli-
cable, causing the &amp;quot;no-support&amp;quot; schema to be used.

5.4 Choosing the Active Perspective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999035">
In order for the notion of object perspective to be truly bene-
ficial, there must be a mechanism for choosing the active per-
spective based on previous discourse. While this topic is still
very much open to investigation, some preliminary research has
revealed several factors that might influence the choice of active
perspective.
Perhaps one of the most influential pieces of information
useful in choosing a perspective is the user&apos;s current goal. In
[MWM85] the user&apos;s goal completely determines which perspec-
tive is active. In their work each perspective which can be taken
on the domain objects is indexed by potential goals. Thus, once
the system has determined what the user&apos;s goal probably is, it
has also determined what perspective the user has probably
taken on the domain objects.
While it is true that the user&apos;s goal is a good source
of information to use to determine the probable perspective,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99754">
102
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968416666667">
other factors may also influence this choice. These include the
attributes and objects mentioned so far in the dialogue. The
mentioned attributes are obviously thought to be important
and one would therefore expect them to be given a fairly high
salience rating in the active perspective. Thus, the choice of
active perspective can be narrowed down to those in which the
mentioned attributes appear with high salience.
By the same token, the objects mentioned so far in the
dialogue can also give a clue concerning the active perspec-
tive. One would expect that the active perspective would deem
these objects important. Therefore the system might look for
perspectives that give high salience ratings to many of the at-
tributes associated with objects that have been mentioned in
the discourse.
In this section I have identified several factors which in-
fluence the choice of active perspective. This choice, however,
is a question which remains as an open research topic. Still
unanswered are questions such as: When does a perspective
change? How long is a perspective active? Is there a rela-
tionship between a discourse unit [CS 85] and perspective? Is
there any structure to the space of perspectives that would put
constraints on moving from one active perspective to another?
These questions must be taken up in future research on per-
spective.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999324">
5.5 An Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989546774193549">
In this section an example is given which indicates how
the choice of perspective influences how a misconception may
be corrected. Recall that in correcting a misattribution one of
the correction schernas used by ROMPER called for a similar
object to be offered as a possible object of confusion. A study of
transcripts reveals, however, that this schema may be instanti-
ated in different ways depending on the context. Consider the
following dialogue:
U. I am interested in investing in some securities to use as
savings instruments. I want something short-term and I
don&apos;t have a lot of money to invest so the instrument must
have small denominations. I am a bit concerned about the
penalties for early withdrawal. What is the penalty on a
T-bill?
S. Treasury Bills don&apos;t have a penalty. Were you thinking of
a Money Market Certificate?
In this case the money market certificate was seen as
being similar to the treasury bill and therefore included in the
response. A different object might be used in a different context.
Consider:
U. I am interested in investing in some securities. Safety is
very important to me, so I would probably like to get
something from the government. I am a bit concerned
about the penalties for early withdrawal. What is the
penalty on a T-bill?
S. Treasury Bills don&apos;t have a penalty. Were you thinking of
a Treasury Bond?
The difference in these two responses can be explained
by different perspectives begin taken on the objects. Suppose
that our knowledge base contains the following objects and at-
tributes in the financial securities domain.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.9747776">
Money Market Certificates
Maturity: 3 months
Denominations: $1,000
Issuer: Commercial Bank
Penalty for Early Withdrawal: 10%
Purchase Place: Commercial Bank
Safety: Medium
Treasury Bills
Maturity: 3 months
Denominations: $1,000
Issuer: US Government
Purchase Place: Federal Reserve
Safety: High
Treasury Bond
Maturity: 7 years
Denominations: $500
Issuer: US Government
Penalty for Early Withdrawal: 20%
Purchase Place: Federal Reserve
Safety: High

<bodyText confidence="0.996806130434783">
The following perspectives might be reasonable for the domain
(here we are assuming salience values from low salience of 0 to
high salience of 1):
Savings Instruments
Maturity â€” 1.0
denominations â€” 1.0
safety â€” 0.5
Issuing Company
issuer â€” 1.0
safety â€” 1.0
purchase-place â€” 0.5
Notice that the perspective of Savings Instruments highlights
maturity and denominations, and somewhat highlights safety.
This indicates that when people are discussing securities as sav-
ings instruments, they are most interested in how long their
money will be tied up and in what denominations they can
save their money. The perspective of Issuing Company, on the
other hand, highlights different attributes. When securities are
discussed from this perspective, things like who the company is
and how stable an investment in the company is, become im-
portant. Other attributes of the securities are ignored (recall
that attributes not mentioned in the perspective get assigned a
low salience rating).

<bodyText confidence="0.998831736842105">
Consider how perspective might effect the misconception
response. Given the discourse preceding the utterance contain-
ing the misconception in our first dialogue, it is reasonable to
assume that the perspective of &amp;quot;Savings Instruments&amp;quot; is the
active perspective at the time of the misconception utterance.3
A system attempting to respond to this misconception might
proceed by attempting to instantiate the wrong object schema
described above. Recall that this schema is applicable when
there is a similar object which has the property involved in the
misconception. The system might collect all objects which have
the attribute in question and then test their similarity with the
object involved in the misconception. In our knowledge base
there are two objects which have the attribute involved in the
misconception: Money Market Certificates and T-Bonds.
Suppose the attributes of these objects were assigned the
salience values given by the Savings Instrument perspective.
Applying the Tversky metric using the salience values attached
by this perspective (and assuming a value of 1 for Oa, and /3)
we get:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5573415">
MM-Cert) = f(maturity. denom) - f(safety)
= 2 - .6 = 1.6 ===&gt; high similarity
T-Bond) = f(safety) - f(maturity, denom)
= .6 -2 = -1.6 ===&gt; low similarity
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97233812">
With these calculations the system would choose the
Money Market Certificate as the possible object of confusion
and respond:
S. Treasury Bills don&apos;t have a penalty. Were you thinking of
a Money Market Certificate?
Contrast the above calculations with calculations that
might occur given a different active perspective. The discourse
preceding the misconception utterance in the second example
suggests the active perspective of &amp;quot;Issuing Company&amp;quot;. Using
the salience values attached by this perspective the similarity
metric would produce the following calculations:
a(T-Bill. MM Cert)
= f() - f(issuer, safety, purchase)
= 0 - 2.6 = -2.6 ===&gt; low similarity
T-Bond)
= f(issuer, safety, purchase) -f()
= 2.6 - 0 = 2.6 ===&gt; high similarity
In this case a reasonable response by the system would be:
S. Treasury Bills don&apos;t have a penalty. Were you thinking of
a Treasury Bond?
As the examples show, changes in the active perspective
can account for the same misconception begin responded to in
two different ways.
&apos;ROMPER does not calculate the active perspective. Instead, it is input
to the system.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991571428571">
If we want our natural-language front-ends to database
or expert systems to mimic human behavior, they must have
the ability to handle misconceptions. This paper has described
a methodology for handling object-related misconceptions and
has illustrated this methodology on misconceptions involving
object misclassifications.
The proposed method for responding to object-related
misconceptions requires associating response schemas with cer-
tain structural configurations of the user model. The response
schemas described in this paper were derived from a corpus of
transcripts and were associated with user model configurations
that would explain their use by a human expert in responding
to a misconception.
A system might use the pairing of strategies to configu-
rations upon encountering an object-related misconception by
searching the user model for one of the identified configurations.
If one was found, the associated schema could be instantiated
to generate a corrective response.
The context-dependent nature of responses to miscon-
ceptions is accounted for not by having the process of correct-
ing misconceptions change with context, but rather by having
what the process works on change with context. A new notion
of object perspective was introduced as an augmentation to a
flat semantic network representation of the user. Object per-
spective provides a highlighting of the user model as a result of
previous discourse. This resulting user model was shown suffi-
cient for accounting for different responses being given to the
same misconception in different situations.

Notice that it could not be explained by a focusing mechanism which highlights attributes which have been mentioned in the preceding discourse because many of the highlighted attributes may not have been explicitly mentioned. What needs to be captured is the feeling that each view calls to mind a &amp;quot;precompiled&amp;quot; set of attributes that seem to be important while that view is in effect. An attempt to explain this effect has been made by defining object perspective as viewing an object as a member of one superordinate when, in fact, it may have many superordinotes ([Cro77], [BW77], and [TWF*82]). The highlighting is achieved through a limited inheritance mechanism. An object inherits only those attributes contributed by the one superordinate deemed &amp;quot;in perspective&amp;quot;. Thus, when a building is viewed as an architectural work, for example, it inherits only those attributes associated with the concept architectural-work in the generalization hierarchy. Any attributes that it might inherit from other superordinates (e.g., home) are ignored.

While this topic is still very much open to investigation, some preliminary research has revealed several factors that might influence the choice of active perspective. Perhaps one of the most influential pieces of information useful in choosing a perspective is the user&apos;s current goal. In [MWM85] the user&apos;s goal completely determines which perspective is active. In their work each perspective which can be taken on the domain objects is indexed by potential goals. Thus, once the system has determined what the user&apos;s goal probably is, it has also determined what perspective the user has probably taken on the domain objects. While it is true that the user&apos;s goal is a good source of information to use to determine the probable perspective, 102 other factors may also influence this choice. These include the attributes and objects mentioned so far in the dialogue. The mentioned attributes a</context>

The like-some-super schema was associated with a user model configuration that indicated that the user believed the misclassified object was like some descendent of the posited 101 superordinate. Notice that both of these user model configurations hinge on a similarity assessment between objects. The similarity metric used by ROMPER is one that is based on the objects&apos; common and disjoint attributes which takes attribute salience into account [Tve77]. This metric will be discussed below. Since the similarity metric takes attribute salience into account and attribute salience is effected by object perspective, the active perspective can influence the selection of a misconception response schema. Second, ROMPER uses the highlighting from object perspective to instantiate the selected response schema. It attempts to do this using only attributes deemed important by the current perspective. 5.3 Object Similarity As was mentioned above, the object similarity metric used by ROMPER must be sensitive to context.

To see this, let us examine the number of ways that a human expert was found to correct one of the misconception types handled by ROMPER: misclassifications. The strategies used by the human experts to respond to a misclassification can be exemplified by the number of possible responses to the following misconception: U. I thought whales were fish. RI. No, they are mammals. You may have thought they were fish because they are fin-bearing and live in the water. However, they are mammals since, (while fish have gills) whales breathe through lungs and feed their young with [Woo84] represents a departure from the canned response in that she is concerned with appropriately structuring a response to reflect a certain tutoring style. R2. No, they are mammals. You may have thought they were fish since they are like the fish, sharks, in that both are large aquatic creatures and both scare people. However, whales are mammals since, (while fish have gills) whales breathe through lungs and feed their young with milk. R3. No, they are mammals. Before analyzing each one of these in detail, let us first note their similarities. Each of the above strategies can be seen as consistin</context>
