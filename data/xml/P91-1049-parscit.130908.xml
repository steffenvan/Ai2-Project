When computer programs disambiguate words
in a sentence, they often encounter non-literal or
novel usages not included in their lexicon. In a
recent study, Georgia Green (personal communica-
tion) estimated that 17% to 20% of the content word
senses encountered in various types of normal
English text are not listed in the dictionary. While
these novel word senses are generally valid, they
occur in such great numbers, and with such little
individual frequency that it is impractical to expli-
citly include them all within the lexicon. Instead,
mechanisms are needed which can derive novel
senses from existing ones; thus allowing a program
to recognize a significant set of potential word senses
while keeping its lexicon within a reasonable size.
Spreading activation is a mechanism that
allows us to do this. Here the program follows paths
from existing word senses stored in a semantic net-
work to other closely associated word senses. By
examining the shape of the resultant path, we can
determine the relationship between the senses con-
tained in the path; thus deriving novel composite
meanings not contained within any of the original
lexical entries. This process is similar to the spread-
ing activation and marker passing techniques of Hirst
[1988], Chamiak [1986], and Norvig [1989] and is
embodied in the Prolog program metallel based on
Fass&apos; program meta5 (Fass [19881).
Metallel&apos;s lexicon is written as a series of
sense frames, each containing information about a
particular word sense. A sense frame can be broken
into two main parts: genera and differentiae. Gen-
era are the genus terms that function as the ancestors
of a word sense. Differentiae denote the qualities
that distinguish a particular sense from other senses
of the same genus. Differentiae can be broken down
into source and target which hold, respectively, the
preferences1 and properties of a sense. Source con-
tains differentiae information concerning another
word sense. Target information concerns the sense
itself.
Connections can be found to other word senses
in one of two ways: through an ancestor relationship
(genus) or through a preference or property relation-
ship (differentia). In the case of differentiae, it is
necessary to extract the word senses from a higher
order structure. For example, (it (n, 1 ) ,
contain (v, 1) , music (n, 1) ] is not a word sense
that is listed in the lexicon, while music (n, 1) is
listed. It is therefore necessary to extract
music (n, 1) from the larger differentia structure in
which it occurs and add it to the path.
Not all paths are valid, indicating that some
criteria of acceptability are needed during analysis.
In addition, paths that are superficially different often
end up being quite similar upon further analysis.
Keeping this in mind, we have attempted to identify
path schemata and associate them with types of non-
literal usage. Specifically, we have concentrated on
identifying instances of metaphor and metonymy.
A metaphorical path schema is one in which
the preference of a verb and the actual target of the
preference both reference different 3 place differen-
tiae2 which can be said to be related. Two 3 place
I Prefaraces indicate the semantic category of the word
sense that fills a specific semantic role with respect to the
word sense being defined. For example, the transitive sense
of the verb eat prefers cm normal usage) an animate subject
and an edible object. Violations of these preferences are in-
dications of non-literal usage. (See Willa and Fass [1990].)
2 A 3 place differentia is a list of senses following a
[Subject, Verb, Object] format in which either the Subject or
the Object consists of the pronominal token it (n, 1 ) .

differentiae are related if both their respective sub-
jects and objects are identical or form a &amp;quot;sister&amp;quot; rela-
tionship3. Additionally, the two verbs of the dif-
ferentiae as well as the verb which generated the
preference must have a similar relationship

For example in the path for the sentence The
ship ploughed the waves, (it (n, 1) , sail (v, 2) ,
water (n, 1) ] and [it (n, 1) , plough (v, 2) ,
soil (n, 1) ] are related since plough (v, 1) ,
plough (v, 2) and sail (v, 2) are children of
transfer (v, 1) , and water (n, 1) and
soil (n, 1) are children of environment (n, 1) .
Also, the pivot nodes4 for the instrument and object
preferences of plough (v, 1) are both
environment (n, 1) , thereby indicating an even
stronger relationship between the instrument and the
object of the sentence. Thus, an analogy exists
between ploughing soil and sailing water; suggesting
a new sense of plough that combines aspects of both.

A metonymic path is indicated when a path is
found from a target sense through one of its inherited
differentiae; thus linking the original sense to a
related sense through a property or preference rela-
tionship. For example in the sentence Denise drank
the botde, one of the properties of bottle (n, 1) is
(it (n, 1) , contain (v, 1) , liquid (n, 1) I.
This differentia allows us to derive a novel meto-
nymic word sense for bottle in which the bottle&apos;s
contents are denoted rather than the bottle itself.
Under metallel, any differentia can act as a conduit
for a metonymy; thus facilitating the generation of
novel metonymies as well as novel word senses.
By using semantic network path schemata to
identify instances of non-literal usage, we have
expanded the power of our program without doing so
at the expense of a larger lexicon. In addition, by
keeping our semantic relationship and path schema
criteria at a general level, we hope to be able to
cover a wide variety of different semantic taxo-
nomies.
