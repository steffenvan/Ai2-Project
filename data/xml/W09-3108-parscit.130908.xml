This paper, which builds on previous studies
on sentence alignment, introduces a sentence
alignment method in which some sentences
are used as “anchors” and a two step proce-
dure is applied. In the first step, some lexical
information such as proper names, technical
terms, numbers and punctuation marks, loca-
tion information and length information are
used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy
some conditions. In the second step, texts are
divided into several segments by using the
anchor sentences as boundaries, and then the
sentences in each segment are aligned by us-
ing a length-based approach. By applying this
segmentation technique, the method avoids
complex computation and error spreading.
Experimental results show that the precision
of the method is 94.6% on the average for
Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment for
multi-domain texts.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999936892857143">
Parallel corpora are very useful for both theory-
oriented linguistic research and application-
oriented cross-language information processing.
For parallel corpora, the most important annota-
tion is alignment, especially sentence alignment,
which is a minimal and essential requirement for
the annotation of a parallel corpus. Aligning Chi-
nese-Uyghur parallel texts at the sentence level,
however, is already very difficult because of the
considerable differences in the syntactic struc-
tures and writing systems of the two languages.
A number of alignment techniques have been
proposed for other language pairs, varying from
statistical methods to lexical methods. There are
basically three kinds of approaches on sentence
alignment: the length-based approach (Gale and
Church, 1991), the lexical approach (Kay and
Röscheisen, 1993), and the combination of the
two (Chen, 1993 and Wu, 1994).
The first approach is based on modeling the
relationship between the lengths of sentences that
are mutual translations. Similar algorithms based
on this idea were developed independently by
Brown, et al (1991) and Gale and Church (1993).
However, their main targets are rigid translations
that are almost literal translations. The method is
applicable for structurally similar European lan-
guages (i.e. English-French or English-German).
One alternative alignment method is the lexi-
con based approach that uses lexical information
to obtain higher accuracy. Kay and Röscheisen
(1993) proposed a relaxation method to sentence
alignment using the word correspondences ac-
quired during the alignment process. Chen
(1993) developed a method based on optimizing
word translation probabilities which he showed
gave better accuracy than the sentence-length
based approach. Wu (1994) used a version of
Gale and Church’s method adapted to Chinese
along with lexical cues in the form of a small
corpus-specific bilingual lexicon to improve
alignment accuracy in text regions containing
multiple sentences of similar length. Melamed
(1996) also developed a method based on word
correspondences, for which he reported sentence-
alignment accuracy slightly better than Gale and
Church. The method does not capture enough
word correspondences for structurally different
languages such as Chinese and Uyghur, mainly
for the following two reasons. One is the differ-
ence in the character types of the two languages.
Chinese uses Chinese characters as its writing
system while Uyghur uses alphabetic character.
The other is the grammatical difference of the
two languages. Chinese is an analytic language
that has SVO word order. In contrast, Uyghur is

a suffixing and agglutinative language that has
SOV word order. Thus, it is impossible in gen-
eral to apply the simple-feature based methods to
Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.
This paper, on the basis of other sentence
alignment methods, introduces an anchor sen-
tence based sentence alignment method, in which
some sentences are used as “anchors” and two
steps are applied. In the first step, some lexical
information such as proper names, technical
terms, numbers and punctuation marks, location
information and length information are used to
generate anchor sentences that satisfy some con-
ditions. In the second step, texts are divided into
several segments by using anchor sentences as
boundaries, and then the sentences in each seg-
ment are aligned by using a length-based ap-
proach.

2 The Chinese-Uyghur Parallel Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877545454545">
Uyghur is a Turkic language spoken by Uyghur
people in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
of China and adjoining areas, which has about 9
million speakers. As one of the official languages
in Xinjiang, Uyghur is widely used in many
fields such as education, communication, public-
ation, etc. Bilingualism in Xinjiang requires
translation from Chinese to Uyghur or in the
opposite direction. Therefore, it is possible and
essential to build a Chinese-Uyghur parallel
corpus for teaching and research in translation,
bilingual lexicography, linguistics, and other
NLP applications. Consequently, we began to
build a Chinese-Uyghur parallel corpus for lin-
guistic research, translation studies, teaching and
applications such as machine translation. The
corpus is a sentence aligned general corpus of
medium size.
So far, over 1 million characters of Chinese
texts, in total 263 texts, and their corresponding
Uyghur texts have been collected from several
sources and included into the raw corpus after
sampling. The corpus texts cover a variety of
styles, such as fiction, scientific texts, govern-
ment documents, law texts, daily conversation
and other texts. Presently, the size of the corpus
is smaller than we expected because it is not easy
to obtain such digital text data which also needs
to be processed before it can be included in the
corpus. The main sources of text data are pub-
lished books, news papers, magazines and some
web pages. The proportions of the different gen-
res in the corpus are shown in Figure 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999596">
There is no previous work or approach specific
to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment. So we
firstly examined many papers related to the sub-
ject to find an appropriae method for Chinese-
Uyghur sentence alignment. Most approaches
share many common properties in the methods
they use and suggest only small modifications to
the earlier approaches. The length based method
is suitable for aligning a very large bilingual cor-
pus. Since it does not use any lexical information
for the alignment task, it can be used between
any pair of languages. However, in distant lan-
guages where characters differ, it is not so effi-
cient. One alternative alignment method is the
lexicon based approach that uses lexical informa-
tion offering the potential for higher accuracy.
However, it is not easy to capture enough word
correspondences or cognates for Chinese and
Uyghur. We may use bilingual dictionaries as an
external resource to retrieve all possible word
translations in such sentence alignment tasks.
However, this is time-consuming and rather
complex because word segmentation and lemma-
tization have to be done before the process of
word matching can be started. Secondly, we tried
some tentative methods to Chinese-Uyghur sen-
tence alignment. According to the preliminary
examination, it is generally not possible to apply
the simple-feature based methods to Chinese-
Uyghur sentence alignment.
Finally, we decided to apply a mixed approach
to obtain better and more efficient results by
combining the three criteria: length, lexical in-
formation and location information. Below are
the detailed descriptions of this approach.

Our algorithm combines techniques adapted
from previous work on sentence and word align-
ment. Our method is similar to Wu’s (1994) in
that it uses both sentence length and lexical in-
formation. But in our method, some lexical cor-
respondences are used to find anchor sentences.
Our method is similar to Simard’s (1992) in that
it uses cognates or anchors for sentence align-
ment. But in our method length information and
anchors are used at different stages of sentence
alignment. Our method is similar to Melamed’s
(1999) in that it uses a bitext mapping technique
to locate anchor points, but it uses sentences as
anchor points instead of words or characters. A
segmentation technique that splits the text into
several sections is also introduced to improve the
length-based approach. As we can see from Fig-
ure 2, a two-step approach is applied to Chinese-
Uyghur sentence alignment.

In the first step, some (1:1) sentence pairs, called
anchor sentences, are extracted by using lexical
information, location and length information. A
three-phase method is applied to anchor sentence
extraction which will be explained in the follow-
ing section.
In the second step, texts are divided into sev-
eral segments by using these sentences as an-
chors, and then all sentences in each segment are
aligned by using a length-based approach.

<bodyText confidence="0.999948379310345">
Brown (1991) firstly introduced the concept of
alignment anchors when he aligned the Hansard
corpus. In our method, we also introduced this
concept, which in our case are anchor sentences.
In a parallel corpus, the anchor sentences are
specific (1:1) sentence pairs that are strongly re-
lated and that satisfy some conditions. All such
sentence pairs which were extracted from bilin-
gual texts during the first step are seen as anchor
sentences. These anchors divide the whole texts
into short aligned segment. The goal of anchor
sentence extraction is to divide the source text
and the target text into one-to-one smaller seg-
ments. And using this segmentation, we attempt
to improve the sentence alignments produced by
the length based alignment. Sentence alignment
tends to be better with shorter segments and,
consequently, better sentence alignments are ob-
tained.
For anchor sentence extraction, we applied a
bitext mapping technique. A bitext map is a set
of pairs (x, y), where x and y refer to precise lo-
cations in the first and second texts respectively,
with the intention of denoting portions of the
texts that correspond to one another (Simard,
1998). However, we used a bitext map of sen-
tence pairs instead of words or characters to
point out the correspondences between these an-
chor sentences (See Figure 3).

The horizontal axis denotes the sentence number
in the Uyghur text, and the vertical axis denotes
the sentence number in the Chinese text. The
anchor sentences, which are shown as anchor
points in the bitext map, can be characterized by
three properties:
Injectivity: no two anchor points in a bitext map
can have the same x or y coordinates.
Linearity: anchor points tend to line up straight.
In other words, all anchor points are to appear
around a straight line.

4.2 Algorithm Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719166666667">
In our anchor sentence extraction algorithm, a
three-step process is applied to extract anchor
sentences. In other words, the search for each
anchor sentence pairs alternates between the fol-
lowing three steps: generation phase, correction
phase and recognition phase.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.617112">
• Generation phase
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990816833333333">
In the generation phase, the algorithm generates
candidate anchor sentence points within a search
rectangle. We define a search rectangle as fol-
lows: Rectangle(x, y, x+3, y+3) in which x=last
anchor point(x) and y=last anchor point(y).
The first search rectangle is anchored at the
origin of the bitext map where x=0, y=0. Subse-
quent search rectangles are anchored at the pre-
viously found points.
In this step, the search for an anchor sentence
begins in a small search rectangle in the bitext
map, whose diagonal is parallel to the main di-
agonal. If no candidate points are found, the
search rectangle is proportionally expanded by
the minimum possible amount, and the genera-
tion cycle is repeated. The rectangle keeps ex-
panding until at least one acceptable point is
found. Three kinds of information such as sen-
tence length, location information and lexical
information are used to generate anchor points.
Sentence pairs that satisfy the following three
conditions are added to the candidate anchor sen-
tence array.
(1) Sentence length ratio
As was shown in the sentence alignment litera-
ture (Church, 1993), the sentence length ratio is
also a very good indication of the alignment of a
sentence pair.
In our method, for sentence pair P(c,u), if Len-
Ratio(c,u)∈[MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], sen-
tence pair P(c,u) would be candidate anchor sen-
tences, in which LenRatio(c,u)= Lc/L„ (L„ is Uy-
ghur sentence length, Lc is Chinese sentence
length).
MinLenRatio and MaxLenRatio are calculated
by using following formula:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.561425333333333">
MaxLenRatio=C´+A/( L,,+B)
MinLenRatio= C´-A (L,,+B)
C´=(C+ Len(C)/Len(U))/2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983417642857143">
The constant C is the expected number of Chi-
nese characters per Uyghur word. C´ is the
weighted value when taking text size into ac-
count, the values of the constants are A=10,
B=14.
(2) Matching score
If the matching score of a sentence pair is above
the threshold (we set the threshold = 1.1), it is
considered a candidate anchor sentence. By ap-
plying this condition, we reject some sentence
pairs with a matching score smaller than the
threshold. The matching score is calculated ac-
cording to the matching degree of the key lexi-
con and punctuations as described in section 4.3.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.792938">
(3) Maximum Angle Deviation (MAD)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999652611111111">
According to the properties of the anchor sen-
tences, the slope of the anchor points should not
be much different from the bitext slope. So some
sentence pairs are rejected by setting a maximum
angle deviation. The angle of each anchor point’s
least-squares line is compared to the arc tangent
of the bitext slope. The anchor point is rejected if
the difference exceeds the maximum angle de-
viation threshold (MAD=3). The angle between
the least-squares line and the bitext slope is cal-
culated according to the following formula:
In this formula, A is the slope of the least-
squares line, B is the bitext map slope.
This filtering process generates anchor sen-
tences with higher accuracy; however, it causes
errors in some cases. So, we introduced another
correction phase in order to reject some wrongly
aligned sentence pairs.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.804271">
• Correction phase
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999527105263158">
In this step, some candidate sentences that are no
anchor sentences are eliminated according to
characteristics of anchor sentences, namely the
length ratios of corresponding segments.
First, the algorithm checks if there are any
conflicts between anchor points. The injective
property of anchor sentences implies that when-
ever two anchor points overlap in the x or y axis,
but are not identical in the region of overlap, then
one of the points must be wrong. To resolve such
conflicts, we employed a lookup method to
eliminate conflicting points.
Secondly, length ratios of corresponding seg-
ments divided by candidate anchor sentences are
calculated according to a similar formula as used
for the sentence length ratio in order to reject
wrongly aligned anchor points.
If the length ratio of the segments LenRa-
tio(c,u)∈[MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], the

<bodyText confidence="0.9980955">
A number of candidate anchor sentences can be
obtained in a certain search region during appli-
cation of the above two steps. For anchor sen-
tence alignment, accuracy is more important than
recall rate. So it is essential to introduce a recog-
nition step in order to achieve higher accuracy by
eliminating some unlikely anchor sentences. In
the recognition step, one best anchor sentence
pair is selected from candidate anchor sentences
according to two parameters: matching score and
length similarity score. The anchor selection al-
gorithm gives a score to each proposed sentence
pair during the recognition phase, and finds the
alignment with the largest sum of scores. A pa-
rameter estimation method is described in the
following section.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996217">
4.3 Parameter Estimation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893594594595">
Matching score: As previous work suggests,
lexical information is critical for sentence align-
ment, especially for finding anchor points. It is
well-known that some proper names and techni-
cal terms have rigid translations in many lan-
guages; numbers and punctuations appear in the
same or similar forms in both source text and
translation text. In a parallel text, for instance, if
a sentence contains a question mark, it is likely
to be aligned to a sentence that also contains this
mark, which can be a strong clue for sentence
alignment. This is also true for Chinese-Uyghur
translations.
However, in our method, lexical and non-
lexical clues are not used to align all sentences,
but to estimate matching scores and to find the
best anchor sentences. We used multiple clues
such as proper names, technical terms, punctua-
tion marks and numbers.
In most cases, proper names, including person
names, location names, organization names, and
technical terms have unique translations that will
be matched easily. But, the problem is that per-
son names and technical terms are often un-
known words. How to identify them is a difficult
problem. In our case, we first collected some
popular proper names and the most frequent
technical terms into a small lexicon that we call
the key lexicon. More than 2000 words are in-
cluded in the key lexicon at present. Then, a very
simple searching method is applied to match cor-
responding words.
In addition, punctuation marks, including
other symbols (e.g. @#$%&amp;), are the most obvi-
ous clues in Chinese and Uyghur translation. The
correlation between Chinese and Uyghur punc-
tuations is extremely high as depicted in Table1.

For punctuation and numbers, no external re-
sources but some rules are applied to estimate the
matching degree of these clues.
The matching scores are calculated according
to the average number of matched clues. In other
words, the more matched proper names, techni-
cal terms, punctuation and numbers, the higher
the matching score.
Length Similarity: Length similarity is a score
that reflects the similarity between the length
ratio of the current sentence pair and the ex-
pected length ratio. The following formula will
be applied to calculate the length similarity of a
proposed sentence pair (A;C, A;U):
LenSimilar(A;C, A;U )=jLen(A;C)/Len(A;U)-Cj/C
Hereby C is expected number of Chinese charac-
ter per Uyghur words. We obtain C=2.01 ex-
perimentally. Len(A;C) and Len(A;U) are the
sentence lengths of A;C, A;U, respectively.
However, the sentence length ratio is not sta-
ble when a Chinese sentence is shorter than 10
characters. So it is necessary to add a weighting
factor WF:
</bodyText>

According to previous work by Gale and Church,
length-based approaches are simple and can
achieve good performance for different language
pairs. Because of this simplicity, many later re-
searchers integrated this method to their sentence
alignment methods. We also applied the length-
based approach to the second step of sentence
alignment.

5.1 Measuring Length in Words and Charac-
ters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99955215">
Different length measuring methods can be used
in the length-based approach. Brown (1991) in-
troduced the length-based algorithm based on the
number of words in sentences, Gail and Church’s
algorithm is similar to the Brown’s algorithm
except that alignment is based on the number of
characters in the sentences.
Uyghur is an alphabetic language while Chi-
nese is a non-alphabetic language. Therefore, it
is a difficult problem to select the best length
measuring model. In general, a Chinese sentence
does not have word boundary information; so
one way to define Chinese sentence length is to
count the number of characters in a sentence.
Another way is to count how many words are in
a sentence after word segmentation. For Uyghur
sentences, we can similarly define the length in
characters or in words.
In our case, we examined three possible length
models described in the following Table 2:
</bodyText>

In general, the smaller the variance, the better the
sentence length model should be. From Table 3,
we can see that the character based length ratio
model has significantly larger variance (0.71)
than the other two models (L-2:0.23, L-3: 0.21).
This means L-1 is not as reliable as L-2 and L-3.
Both L-2 and L-3 have similar variance, but L-3
is better than L-2 with regard to the correlation
coefficient, which indicates that sentence lengths
have higher correlation if the lengths of Chinese
and Uyghur texts are measured in characters and
words, respectively. A regression analysis of the
three models also proved this result. So we ap-
plied the L-3 model to the length ratio examina-
tion and length based sentence alignment.

translated into longer sentences in the other lan-
guage, and that shorter sentences tend to be
translated into shorter sentences. A probabilistic
score is assigned to each pair of proposed sen-
tence pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the
two sentences and the variance of this ratio. This
probabilistic score is used in a dynamic pro-
gramming framework in order to find the maxi-
mum likelihood alignment of sentences.
The parameters C and SZ are used for likeli-
hood estimation. C is the expected number of
Chinese characters per Uyghur words. The pa-
rameters C and SZ are determined empirically
from a hand aligned parallel corpus of multi-
domain texts. According to our statistical results,
we obtained C=2.01 and SZ =3.24.
Brown (1991) assume that every parallel cor-
pus can be aligned in terms of a sequence of
minimal alignment segments, which they call
“beads”, in which sentences align 1-to-1, 1-to-2,
2-to-1, 2-to-2, 1-to-0, or 0-to-1. The alignment
model is a generative probabilistic model for

predicting the lengths of the sentences compos-
ing sequences of such beads. The model assumes
that each bead in the sequence is generated ac-
cording to a fixed probability distribution over
bead types. We also calculated the probability of
different alignment types.

From the above statistical results, it is clear that
the correlation between the length of a Chinese
sentence in characters and the length of its Uy-
ghur translation sentence in words is extremely
high. This high correlation suggests that length
might be a strong clue for sentence alignment.
In our cases, we applied the length-based ap-
proach suggested by Gale and Church after some
parameters had been changed.

Firstly, we aligned sentences by using two ap-
proaches: a length-based algorithm, and an an-
chor sentence based algorithm. Then we manu-
ally checked the alignment results for errors and
calculated precision and recall scores. Experi-
mental results show that our anchor sentence
based approach yields higher accuracy than the
purely length based approach. The precision of
the method is 94.6% on the average for Chinese-
Uyghur sentence alignment on multi-domain
texts. This is 2% higher than that of a purely
length based approach.

all errors during sentence alignment in order to
find reasons and solutions. The following is an

6.3 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989172413793">
Firstly, the style of a text affects the sentence
alignment results. In law texts and official docu-
ments, precision is very high in comparison with
the results in texts of other styles; even 100%
accuracy has been achieved. The reason for this
may be the language style of source texts and
translated texts. The error rate is comparatively
higher in fiction texts because of their free trans-
lation style.
Secondly, complex sentence beads that in-
clude deletion and insertion during translation
affect the alignment accuracy. According to Ta-
ble 7, complex alignment types that the current
alignment algorithm did not take into considera-
tion account for 2.2% of the errors in Chinese-
Uyghur translations. So errors caused by these
&amp;quot;unorthodox&amp;quot; translation patterns are unavoid-
able. There are many such errors in sample T8.
By examination, we found that the number of
sentences in the Chinese text (122 sentences) and
corresponding Uyghur text (179 sentences) is so
unbalanced that many complex alignment types
are involved. This is a direct reason for the high
error rate.
Finally, anchor sentences play an important
role during alignment. However, we found that it
leads to more mistakes once wrong anchor sen-
tence are selected. For instance, in T9, just one
wrong anchor sentence caused up to four errors

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999158125">
We have developed a very effective sentence
alignment method based on anchor sentences. In
our method, firstly anchor sentences are ex-
tracted from bilingual texts according to key
lexical information, location information and
length information; secondly, whole texts are
divided into small segments by using anchor sen-
tence points; finally, sentences in each small
segment are aligned by using a length-based ap-
proach. We have implemented the proposed
method on the parallel Chinese-Uyghur corpus.
Experimental results show that the precision rate
of the method is 2% higher than that of a purely
length-base approach. Differences and advan-
tages of our anchor sentence based method are
compared to other methods in Table 6.

<abstract confidence="0.999561571428572">This paper, which builds on previous studies on sentence alignment, introduces a sentence alignment method in which some sentences are used as “anchors” and a two step procedure is applied. In the first step, some lexical information such as proper names, technical terms, numbers and punctuation marks, location information and length information are used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy some conditions. In the second step, texts are divided into several segments by using the anchor sentences as boundaries, and then the sentences in each segment are aligned by using a length-based approach. By applying this segmentation technique, the method avoids complex computation and error spreading. Experimental results show that the precision of the method is 94.6% on the average for Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment for multi-domain texts.</abstract>

Melamed (1996) also developed a method based on word correspondences, for which he reported sentencealignment accuracy slightly better than Gale and Church. The method does not capture enough word correspondences for structurally different languages such as Chinese and Uyghur, mainly for the following two reasons. One is the difference in the character types of the two languages. Chinese uses Chinese characters as its writing system while Uyghur uses alphabetic character. The other is the grammatical difference of the two languages. Chinese is an analytic language that has SVO word order. In contrast, Uyghu</context>

Aligning Chinese-Uyghur parallel texts at the sentence level, however, is already very difficult because of the considerable differences in the syntactic structures and writing systems of the two languages. A number of alignment techniques have been proposed for other language pairs, varying from statistical methods to lexical methods. There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale and Church, 1991), the lexical approach (Kay and Röscheisen, 1993), and the combination of the two (Chen, 1993 and Wu, 1994). The first approach is based on modeling the relationship between the lengths of sentences that are mutual translations. Similar algorithms based on this idea were developed independently by Brown, et al (1991) and Gale and Church (1993). However, their main targets are rigid translations that are almost literal translations. The method is applicable for structurally similar European languages (i.e. English-French or English-German). One alternative alignment method is the lexicon based approach that uses lexical information to obtain higher accuracy. Kay and Röscheisen (1993) proposed a rela</context>
