Recently, language barrier becomes the
major problem for people to search, retrieve,
and understand WWW documents in
different languages. This paper deals with
query translation issue in cross-language
information retrieval, proper names in
particular. Models for name identification,
name translation and name searching are
presented. The recall rates and the
precision rates for the identification of
Chinese organization names, person names
and location names under MET data are
(76.67%, 79.33%), (87.33%, 82.33%) and
(77.00%, 82.00%), respectively. In name
translation, only 0.79% and 1.11% of
candidates for English person names and
location names, respectively, have to be
proposed. The name searching facility is
implemented on an MT sever for
information retrieval on the WWW. Under
this system, user can issue queries and read
documents with his familiar language.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997412666666667">
World Wide Web (WWW) is the most useful
and powerful information dissemination system
on the Internet. For the multilingual feature,
the language barrier becomes the major problem
for people to search, retrieve, and understand
WWW documents in different languages. That
decreases the dissemination power of WWW to
some extent. The researches of cross-language
information retrieval abbreviated as CLIR (Oard
and Don, 1996; Oard 1997) aim to tackle the
language barriers. There are several important
issues in CLIR:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.870420583333333">
(1) Queries and documents are in different
languages, so that translation is required.
(2) Words in a query may be ambiguous, thus
disambiguation is required.
(3) Queries are usually short, thus expansion
is required.
(4) Word boundary in queries of some
languages (Chen and Lee, 1996) is not
clear, thus segmentation is required.
(5) A document may be in more than one
language, thus language identification is
required.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997691214285715">
This paper focuses on query translation issue,
proper name in particular.
The percentage of user queries containing
proper names is very high. The paper
(Thompson and Dozier, 1997) reported an
experiment over periods of several days in 1995.
It showed 67.8%, 83.4%, and 38.8% of queries
to Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, and
Washington Post, respectively, involve name
searching. In CLIR, three tasks are needed:
name identification, name translation, and name
searching. Because proper names are usually
unknown words, it is hard to find in
monolingual dictionary not to mention bilingual
dictionary. Coverage is one of the major
problems in dictionary-based approaches
(Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Davis, 1997; Hull
and Grefenstette, 1996). Corpus-based
approaches (Brown, 1996; Oard 1996; Sheridan
and Ballerini, 1996) set up thesaurus from large-
scale corpora. They provide narrow but
specific coverage of the language, and are
complementary to broad and shallow coverage
in dictionaries. However, domain shifts and
term align accuracy are major limitations of
corpus-based approaches. Besides, proper
names are infrequent words relative to other
content words in corpora. In information

retrieval, most frequent and less frequent words
are regarded as unimportant words and may be
neglected.
This paper will propose methods to extract
and classify proper names from Chinese queries
(Section 1). Then, Chinese proper names are
translated into English proper names (Section 2).
Finally, the translated queries are sent to an MT
sever for information retrieval on the WWW
(Bian and Chen, 1997). The retrieved English
home pages are presented in Chinese and/or
English.

1 Name Extraction and Classification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953965517242">
People, affairs, time, places and things are five
basic entities in a document. If we can catch
the fundamental entities, we can understand the
document to some degree. These entities are
also the targets that users are interested in.
That is, users often issue queries to retrieve such
kinds of entities. The basic entities often
appear in proper names, which are major
unknown words in natural language texts.
Thus name extraction is indispensable for both
natural language understanding and information
retrieval.
In famous message understanding system
evaluation and message understanding
conferences (MUC) and the related multilingual
entity tasks (MET), named entity, which covers
named organizations, people, and locations,
along with date/time expressions and monetary
and percentage expressions, is one of tasks for
evaluating technologies. In MUC-6 named
entity task, the systems developed by SRA
(Krupka, 1995) and BBN (Weischedel, 1995) on
the person name recognition portion have very
high recall and precision scores (over 94%).
In Chinese language Processing, Chen and
Lee (1996) present various strategies to identify
and classify three types of proper nouns, i.e.,
Chinese person names, Chinese transliterated
person names and organization names. In
large-scale experiments, the average precision
rate is 88.04% and the average recall rate is
92.56% for the identification of Chinese person
names.
The above approaches can be employed to
collect Chinese and English proper name sets
from WWW (very large-scale corpora).
Identification of proper names in queries is
different from that in large-scale texts. The
major difference is that query is always short.
Thus its context is much shorter than full texts
and some technologies involving larger contexts
are useless. The following paragraphs depict
the methods we adopt in the identification of
Chinese proper names.
A Chinese person name is composed of
surname and name parts. Most Chinese
surnames are single character and some rare
ones are two characters. A married woman
may place her husband&apos;s surname before her
surname. Thus there are three possible types of
surnames, i.e., single character, two characters
and two surnames together. Most names are
two characters and some rare ones are one
character. Theoretically, every character can
be considered as names rather than a fixed set.
Thus the length of Chinese person names range
from 2 to 6 characters. Three kinds of
recognition strategies shown below are adopted:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999545">
(1) name-formulation statistics
(2) context cues, e.g., titles, positions,
speech-act verbs, and so on
(3) cache
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998550333333333">
Name-formulation statistics form the baseline
model. It proposes possible candidates. The
context cues add extra scores to the candidates.
Cache records the occurrences of all the possible
candidates in a paragraph. If a candidate
appears more than once, it has high tendency to
be a person name.
Transliterated person names denote foreigners.
Compared with Chinese person names, the
length of transliterated names is not restricted to
2 to 6 characters. The following strategies are
adopted to recognize transliterated names:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95134">
(1) character condition
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.90458775">
Two special character sets are setup.
The first character of transliterated names
and the remaining characters must belong
to these two sets, respectively. The
character condition is a loose restriction.
The string that satisfies the character
condition may denote a location, a
building, an address, etc. It should be
employed with other cues (refer to (2)-
(4)).
(2) titles
Titles used in Chinese person names are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993132">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.972466">
also applicable to transliterated person
names.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.847356">
(3) name introducers
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989015666666667">
Some words can introduce transliterated
names when they are used at the first
time.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.866102">
(4) special verbs
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997886584905661">
The same set of speech-act verbs used in
Chinese person names are also used for
transliterated person names.
Cache mechanism is also helpful in the
identification of transliterated names. A
candidate that satisfies the character condition
and one of the cues will be placed in the cache.
At the second time, the cues may disappear, but
we can recover the transliterated person name by
checking cache.
The structure of organization names is more
complex than that of person names. Basically,
a complete organization name can be divided
into two parts, i.e., name and keyword.
Organization names, country names, person
names and location names can be placed into the
name part of organization names. Person
names can be found by the approaches specified
in the last paragraph. Location names will be
touched later. Transliterated names may
appear in the name part. We use the same
character sets mentioned in the last paragraph.
If a sequence of characters meet the character
condition, the sequence and the keyword form
an organization name. Common content words
may be inserted in between the name part and
the keyword part. In current version, at most
two content words are allowed. Besides, we
utilize the feature of multiple occurrences of
organization names in a document and propose
n-gram model to deal with this problem.
Although cache mechanism and n-gram use the
same feature, i.e., multiple occurrences, their
concepts are totally different. For organization
names, we are not sure when a pattern should be
put into cache because its left boundary is hard
to decide.
The structure of location names is similar to
that of organization names. A complete
location name is composed of a person name (or
a location name) and a location keyword. For
the treatment of location names without
keywords, we introduce some locative verbs.
Cache is also useful and N-gram model is
employed to recover those names that do not
meet the character condition.
We test our system with three sets of MET
data (i.e., MET-1 formal run, MET-2 training,
and MET-2 dry run). The recall rates and the
precision rates for the identification of Chinese
organization names, person names and location
names are (76.67%, 79.33%), (87.33%, 82.33%)
and (77.00%, 82.00%), respectively.

(WG) and Pinyin are two famous systems to
romanize Chinese (Lu, 1995). The proper
name translation problem can be formulated as:
(1) Collect English proper name sets from
WWW.
(2) Identify Chinese proper names from
queries.
(3) Romanize the Chinese proper names.
(4) Select candidates from suitable proper
name sets.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997035625">
In this way, the translation problem is
transferred to a phonic string matching problem.
If an English proper name denotes a Chinese
entity, e.g., Lee Teng-hui denotes &amp;quot; ff &amp;quot;
(President of R.O.C.), the matching is simple.
Otherwise, the matching is not trivial. For
example, we issue a query &amp;quot;PT 44if1l4&amp;quot; in
Chinese to retrieve information about Alps.
The Pinyin romanization of this name is
a.er.bei.si.shan&apos;. The string &amp;quot;aerbeisishan&amp;quot; is
not similar to the string &amp;quot;alps&amp;quot;. We develop
several language models incrementally to tackle
the translation problem. The first issue we
consider is how many common characters there
are in a romanized Chinese proper name and an
English proper name candidate. Here the order
is significant. For example, the Chinese query
is it $4 4.a Its WG romanization is
`ai.ssu.chi.le.ssu&apos;. The corresponding proper
name is Aeschylus. Three characters (shown
as follow in underline) are matched in order:
The dot is inserted among romanization of Chinese
characters for clear reading. Later, the dot may be
dropped when strings are matched.

<bodyText confidence="0.9757996875">
aeschylus
a i s such i lessu
We normalize it by the length of the candidate
(i.e., 9), and get a score 0.33. In an experiment,
there are 1,534 pairs of Chinese-English person
names. We conduct a mate matching: to use
each Chinese proper name as a query, and try to
find the corresponding English proper name
from the 1,534 candidates. The performance is
evaluated in such a way that how many
candidates should be proposed to cover the
correct translation. In other words, the average
rank of correct translations is reported. The
performances of the baseline model under WG
and Pinyin systems are 40.06 and 31.05,
respectively. The major problem of the
baseline model is: if a character is matched
incorrectly, those characters that follow this
character will not contribute to the matching.
In the above example, chi (&apos;4&apos;) will be helpless
for translation.
For reducing the error propagation, we
consider syllables of the candidate in advance.
The matching is done in syllables instead of the
whole word. For example, Aeschylus contains
three syllables. The matching is shown as
follows:
aes chy lus
aissu chi
lessu
The score is increased to 0.67 (6/9). In the
similar experiment, the performances of the new
language model are improved. The average
ranks are 35.65 and 27.32 for WG and Pinyin
systems, respectively.
Observing the performance differences
between WG and Pinyin systems, we find they
use different phones to denote the same sounds.
The following shows examples:
vowels
p vs. b, t vs. d, k vs. g, ch vs. j, ch vs. q,
hs vs. x, ch vs. zh, j vs. r, ts vs. z, ts vs. c
(2) consonants
-ien vs. -ian, -ieh vs. -ie, -ou vs. -o,
-o vs. -uo, -ung vs. -ong, -ueh vs. -ue,
-uei vs. -ui, -lung vs. -long, -i vs. -yi
A new language model integrates the
alternatives. The average ranks of the mate
match is 25.39. The result is better than those
of separate romanization systems.
In the above ranking, each matching character
is given an equal weight. We postulate that the
first letter of each Romanized Chinese character
is more important than others. For example, c
in chi is more important than h and i. Thus it
should have higher score. The following
shows a new scoring function:
score=E,(f,*(el,/(2* cl,)+0.5)+0,*0.5)/el
where
el: length of English proper name,
el,: length of syllable i in English proper name,
cl,: number of Chinese characters correspond-
ing to syllable i,
t: number of matched first-letters in syllable i,
o,: number of matched other letters in syllable i.
We reduplicate the above example as follows.
The first letter is in capital.
aes chy lus
AiSsu Chi LeSsu
_ __ _
The corresponding parameters are listed below:
el1=3, e11-2, f1=2, or-0, el=9,
e12=3, cl2=1, f2=1, 02=1,
el3=3, c13=2, f3=2, 03=0.
The new score of this candidate is 0.83. Under
the new experiment, the average rank is 20.64.
If the first letter of a Romanized Chinese
character is not matched, we give it a penalty.
The average ranks of the enhanced model is
16.78.

<bodyText confidence="0.999905764705882">
We further consider the pronunciation rules in
English. For example, ph usually has f sound.
If all the similar rules are added to the language
model, the average rank is enhanced to 12.11.
Table 1 summarizes the distribution of ranks of
the correct candidate. The first row shows the
range of ranks. The second row shows the
number of candidates within the range. About
one-third have rank 1. On the average, only
0.79% of candidates have to be proposed to

method is quite effective.
We also make two extra experiments. Given

<bodyText confidence="0.999852583333333">
This paper proposes knowledge from character,
sentence, and paragraph levels to identify
different kinds of proper names. The person
name translation problem is formulated as a
phonic string matching problem. We consider
the length of matching characters, syllables,
different romanization systems, pronunciation
rules, positive and negative scores in ranking.
The name searching mechanism is integrated
into a Chinese-English information retrieval
system. In this way, languages are transparent
to users on the Internet. In current
implementation, only 0.79% and 1.11% of
candidates for English person names and
location names, respectively have to be proposed
during name translation.
This model can be employed to set up a
bilingual proper name dictionary. We can
collect English and Chinese proper names from
Internet periodically, and then conduct a mate
matching. Human can be involved to select the
correct translation. That will reduce the cost to
develop a large scale bilingual proper name
dictionary for name searching.

If we can catch the fundamental entities, we can understand the document to some degree. These entities are also the targets that users are interested in. That is, users often issue queries to retrieve such kinds of entities. The basic entities often appear in proper names, which are major unknown words in natural language texts. Thus name extraction is indispensable for both natural language understandi</context>

That decreases the dissemination power of WWW to some extent. The researches of cross-language information retrieval abbreviated as CLIR (Oard and Don, 1996; Oard 1997) aim to tackle the language barriers. There are several important issues in CLIR: (1) Queries and documents are in different languages, so that translation is required. (2) Words in a query may be ambiguous, thus disambiguation is required. (3) Queries are usually short, thus expansion is required. (4) Word boundary in queries of some languages (Chen and Lee, 1996) is not clear, thus segmentation is required. (5) A document may be in more than one language, thus language identification is required. This paper focuses on query translation issue, proper name in particular. The percentage of user queries containing proper names is very high. The paper (Thompson and Dozier, 1997) reported an experiment over periods of several days in 1995.
