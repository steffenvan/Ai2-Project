Abstract 2 Definition of Transitivity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993762">
This paper describes an on-going study
which applies the concept of transitivity
to news discourse for text processing tasks.
The complex notion of transitivity is de-
fined and the relationship between transi-
tivity and information foregrounding is ex-
plained. A sample corpus of news articles
has been coded for transitivity. The corpus
is being used in two text processing exper-
iments.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973236842105">
The basic hypothesis of this study is that the degree
of transitivity associated with a clause indicates the
level of importance of a clause in a narrative text.
For this assumption to form the basis of a practical
implementation, transitivity must be objectively de-
fined and the definition must be able to be processed
automatically.
The notion of transitivity clearly has many impli-
cations for text processing, in particular information
retrieval and automatic summarising, because it can
be used to grade information in a document accord-
ing to importance. In an information retrieval con-
text, it means that a transitivity index could influ-
ence a decision about the relevance of a document to
a query. In automatic summarising, it means that
less important information could be sieved accord-
ing to transitivity, leaving only the most important
information to form the basis of a summary.
News discourse was chosen because it is narra-
tive based and therefore broadly applicable to the
notion of transitivity. There has also been exten-
sive research in the structural characteristics of this
text type (Duszak, 1995) (Kay and Aylett, 1994)
(Bell, 1991). However, the study poses a challenge
in the sense that the notion of transitivity has pre-
viously been exemplified with relatively simple sen-
tences presenting action sequences. A central ques-
tion is how well the concept can be transferred to
a domain which, although narrative based, diverges
into commentary and analysis.
Transitivity is usually considered to be a property of
an entire clause (Hopper and Thompson, 1980). It
is, broadly, the notion that an activity is transferred
from an agent to a patient. It is therefore inherently
linked with a clause containing two participants in
which an action is highly effective.
The concept of transitivity has been defined in
terms of the following parameters:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.966540428571429">
A. Participants 2 or more participants
1 1 participant
B. Kinesis action
non-action
C. Aspect telic

D. Punctuality punctual

E. Volitionality volitional
1 non-volitional
F. Affirmation affirmative
1 negative
G. Mode realis

H. Agency A high in potency
A low in potency
I. Affectedness of 0 0 totally affected

<bodyText confidence="0.958847333333333">
Each component of transitivity contributes to the
overall effectiveness or &apos;intensity&apos; with which an ac-
tion is transferred from one participant to another.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9738765">
A. There must be at least two participants for an
action to be transferred.
B. Transferable actions can be contrasted with non-
transferable states, e.g. he pushed her; he thought
about her.
C. An action is either wholly or partially completed
according to whether it is telic or atelic, e.g. I played
the piano; I am playing the piano.
D. Punctual actions have no transitional phase be-
tween start and end point, having a greater effect

on their patients, e.g. he kicked the door; he opened
the door.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9865375">
E. An action is more effective if it is volitional, e.g.
he bought the present; he forgot the present.
F. An affirmative action has greater transitivity than
a negative action, e.g. he called the boy; he didn&apos;t
call the boy.
G. An action which is realis (occurring in the real
world) is more effective than an action which is ir-
realis (occurring in a non-real contingency world),
e.g. they attacked the enemy; they might attack the
enemy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.557512">
H. Participants high in agency transfer an action
more effectively than participants low in agency, e.g.
he shocked me; the price shocked me.
I. A patient is wholly or partially affected, e.g. I
washed the dishes; I washed some of the dishes.
J. Individuation refers to the distinctiveness of the
object from the agent and of the object from its own
background. The following properties contribute to
the individuation of an object.

Based on these components, clauses can be clas-
sified as more or less transitive. In English, as a
whole, transitivity is indicated by a cluster of fea-
tures associated with a clause.
The concept of foreground and background infor-
mation is based on the idea that in narrative dis-
course some parts are more essential than others.
Certain sections of a narrative are crucially linked
with the temporal sequence of events which form
the backbone of a text. This material is normally
foregrounded. In contrast, the contextual informa-
tion relating to characters and environment is back-
grounded.

3 Transitivity and Text Processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981285714286">
The relationship between transitivity and fore-
grounding has potential for text processing, in par-
ticular, information retrieval and automatic sum-
marising. If it is possible to identify which clauses
are central to a text, the information can be used to
contribute to a relevance assessment or as the basis
for a derived summary.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990204">
3.1 Information Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999911">
The standard model of text retrieval is based on the
identification of matching query/document terms
which are weighted according to their distribution
throughout a text database. This model has also
been enhanced by a number of linguistic techniques:
expansion of query/document terms according to
thesaurus relations, synonyms, etc.
The proposal for this study is to code matching
query/document terms for the transitivity value of
the clause in which they occur, as a starting point
for producing comparative term weights based on
linguistic features. Terms which are less central to
a discourse will, on this basis, be given lower scores
because they occur in low transitivity clauses. The
net result will be to produce a document ranking
order which more closely represents the importance
of the documents to a user. There is also potential
for producing a transitivity index for an entire doc-
ument as well as for individual clauses so that this
measure could also feature in a relevance assessment.

3.2 Automatic Summarising
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999721875">
The fundamental task in automatic summarising is
to identify the most important sections of a text so
that these can be extracted and possibly modified to
provide a summary. The notion of transitivity pro-
vides a measure against which clauses can be scored.
The highest scoring clauses, either above a threshold
value or on a comparative basis, can then be iden-
tified as the basic clauses of a summary. These can
either be extracted raw or in context with pronom-
inal references resolved and any logical antecedents
included. A previous study in this area (Decker,
1985) extracted clauses and sentences on the basis
of syntactic patterns which broadly correlate with
certain features of transitivity. The present study fo-
cuses on the semantic features of transitivity rather
than associated syntax.

4 Experimental Procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947652173913">
The feasibility of using transitivity as a tool in text
processing will be assessed by two experiments us-
ing the same corpus. Clauses in the corpus must
be hand-coded for transitivity. The difficulties en-
countered in this process will determine the basis
for future automation. For the information retrieval
task, only the clauses containing query/document
matching terms will be coded for transitivity. For
the automatic summarising experiment all sentences
within a text will be coded.
For the information retrieval experiment, ten
queries are put to a newspaper database: a demon-
stration system running on WAIS (Wide Area Infor-
mation Server), carrying two weeks of articles from
the Times newspaper from 1993 and 1994. The re-
sults of the queries are downloaded in their initial
ranked order (ranked by a host ranking algorithm)
and re-ranked by a serial batch processor written in
C++. The processor identifies the transitivity fea-
tures associated with each matching clause and pro-
duces a ranked output of documents based on the
weights assigned to each clause in which the search
terms occur. The weights assigned to each clause are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990613">
370
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990567567567">
numerically equivalent to the number of transitivity
features associated with each clause. The total tran-
sitivity weight for an entire document is the sum of
clause weights normalised by document length.
The output dataset consists of a total of 185 news
articles, an average of 18.5 per batch. Each set of
articles is ranked by volunteers. The articles are
ranked for their degree of relevance to a query in two
ways: on a scale of one to ten; and comparatively, by
the degree of relevance of an article against all other
articles. All terms are treated as equal so that dis-
crimination between documents is based purely on
accumulative transitivity scores. The performance
of the ranking technique is evaluated according to
two precision measures: the Spearman rank corre-
lation coefficient (rho) and the CRE (Coefficient of
Ranking Effectiveness) (Noreault et al. , 1977).
For the automatic summarising experiment, ten
articles are taken from the corpus at random. Sum-
maries are produced by extracting clauses according
to transitivity scores. In the initial implementation,
transitivity scores will be equal to the number of
transitivity features associated with the main clause
of each sentence. The selection of sentences for a
summary will be based, initially, on comparative
transitivity scores and a reduction factor which will
determine the number of sentences selected based on
the length of a document.
Summaries will be analysed and assessed by vol-
unteers for coverage, in terms of the original text,
and comprehensibility as a separate text. The sum-
maries will be compared against summaries of the
same texts compiled by the syntactic technique men-
tioned previously and also against summaries con-
sisting of the first paragraph of each news article.
The study is currently at the end of the coding
stage for the information retrieval experiment.
