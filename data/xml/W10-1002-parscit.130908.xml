Second language acquisition research since
the 90s has emphasized the importance of
supporting awareness of language categories
and forms, and input enhancement techniques
have been proposed to make target language
features more salient for the learner.
We present an NLP architecture and web-
based implementation providing automatic vi-
sual input enhancement for web pages. Learn-
ers freely choose the web pages they want to
read and the system displays an enhanced ver-
sion of the pages. The current system supports
visual input enhancement for several language
patterns known to be problematic for English
language learners, as well as fill-in-the-blank
and clickable versions of such pages support-
ing some learner interaction.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990893346938776">
A significant body of research into the effectiveness
of meaning-focused communicative approaches to
foreign language teaching has shown that input
alone is not sufficient to acquire a foreign lan-
guage, especially for older learners (cf., e.g., Light-
bown and Spada, 1999). Recognizing the important
role of consciousness in second-language learning
(Schmidt, 1990), learners have been argued to ben-
efit from (Long, 1991) or even require (Lightbown,
1998) a so-called focus on form to overcome incom-
plete or incorrect knowledge of specific forms or
regularities. Focus on form is understood to be “an
occasional shift of attention to linguistic code fea-
tures” (Long and Robinson, 1998, p. 23).
10
In an effort to combine communicative and struc-
turalist approaches to second language teaching,
Rutherford and Sharwood Smith (1985) argued for
the use of consciousness raising strategies drawing
the learner’s attention to specific language proper-
ties. Sharwood Smith (1993, p. 176) coined the term
input enhancement to refer to strategies highlighting
the salience of language categories and forms.
Building on this foundational research in second
language acquisition and foreign language teaching,
in this paper we present an NLP architecture and a
system for automatic visual input enhancement of
web pages freely selected by language learners. We
focus on learners of English as a Second Language
(ESL), and the language patterns enhanced by the
system include some of the well-established diffi-
culties: determiners and prepositions, the distinction
between gerunds and to-infinitives, wh-question for-
mation, tense in conditionals, and phrasal verbs.
In our approach, learners can choose any web
page they like, either by using an ordinary search-
engine interface to search for one or by entering the
URL of the page they want to enhance. In contrast to
textbooks and other pre-prepared materials, allow-
ing the learner to choose up-to-date web pages on
any topic they are interested in and enhancing the
page while keeping it intact (with its links, multi-
media, and other components working) clearly has
a positive effect on learner motivation. Input en-
hanced web pages also are attractive for people out-
side a traditional school setting, such as in the vol-
untary, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge often
referred to as lifelong learning. The latter can be
particularly relevant for adult immigrants, who are

already functionally living in the second language
environment, but often stagnate in their second lan-
guage acquisition and lack access or motivation to
engage in language classes or other explicit lan-
guage learning activities. Nevertheless, they do use
the web to obtain information that is language-based
and thus can be enhanced to also support language
acquisition while satisfying information needs.
In terms of paper organization, in section 2 we
first present the system architecture and in 2.1 the
language phenomena handled, before considering
the issues involved in evaluating the approach in 2.2.
The context of our work and related approaches are
discussed in section 3, and we conclude and discuss
several avenues for future research in section 4.

2 The Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923833333333">
The WERTi system (Working with English Real
Texts interactively) we developed follows a client-
server paradigm where the server is responsible for
fetching the web page and enriching it with annota-
tions, and the client then receives the annotated web
page and transforms it into an enhanced version.
The client here is a standard web browser, so on the
learner’s side no additional software is needed.
The system currently supports three types of input
enhancement: i) color highlighting of the pattern or
selected parts thereof, ii) a version of the page sup-
porting identification of the pattern through clicking
and automatic color feedback, and iii) a version sup-
porting practice, such as a fill-in-the-blank version
of the page with automatic color feedback.
The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.
Essentially, the automated input enhancement pro-
cess consists of the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999068875">
1. Fetch the page.
2. Find the natural language text portions in it.
3. Identify the targeted language pattern.
4. Annotate the web page, marking up the lan-
guage patterns identified in the previous step.
5. Transform the annotated web page into the out-
put by visually enhancing the targeted pattern
or by generating interaction possibilities.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.93765775">
Steps 1–4 take place on the server side, whereas step
5 happens in the learner’s browser.1 As NLP is only
involved in step 3, we here focus on that step.

While the first prototype of the WERTi system2
presented at CALICO (Amaral, Metcalf and Meur-
ers, 2006) and EUROCALL (Metcalf and Meurers,
2006) was implemented in Python, the current sys-
tem is Java-based, with all NLP being integrated in
the UIMA framework (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).
UIMA is an architecture for the management and
analysis of unstructured information such as text,
which is built on the idea of referential annotation
and can be seen as an NLP analysis counterpart

2.1 Implemented Modules
The modules implemented in the current system
handle a number of phenomena commonly judged
as difficult for second language learners of English.
In the following we briefly characterize each mod-
ule, describing the nature of the language pattern,
the required NLP, and the input enhancement results,
which will be referred to as activities.

In principle, alternatives (e.g., other prepositions)
can also be grammatical and appropriate. The ques-

Gerunds vs. to-infinitives
Deciding when a verb is required to be realized as
a to-infinitive and when as a gerund -ing form can be
difficult for ESL learners. Current school grammars
teach students to look for certain lexical clues that
reliably indicate which form to choose. Examples
of such clues are prepositions such as after and of,
which can only be followed by a gerund.
In our NLP approach to this language pattern, we
use Constraint Grammar rules (Karlsson et al., 1995)
on top of POS tagging, which allow for straightfor-
ward formulation of local disambiguation rules such
as: “If an -ing form immediately follows the prepo-
sition by, select the gerund reading.” Standard POS

For the Click activity, the web page is shown
with colored gerund and to-infinitival forms and the
learner can click on the corresponding clue phrases.
For the Practice activity, the learner is presented
with a fill-in-the-black version of the web page, as
in the screenshot in Figure 4. For each blank, the
learner needs to enter the gerund or to-infinitival
form of the base form shown in parentheses.

In order to identify the wh-question patterns, we
employ a set of 126 hand-written Constraint Gram-
mar rules. The respective wh-word acts as the lex-
ical clue to the question as a whole, and the rules
then identify the subject and verb phrase based on
the POS and lexical information of the local context.
Aside from the Color activity highlighting the rel-
evant parts of a wh-question, we adapted the other
activity types to this more complex language pattern.
The Click activity prompts learners to click on either
the subject or the verb phrase of the question. The
Practice activity presents the words of a wh-question
in random order and requires the learner to rearrange
them into the correct one.

Conditionals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988076875">
English has five types of conditionals that are used
for discussing hypothetical situations and possible
outcomes. The tenses used in the different condi-
tional types vary with respect to the certainty of the
outcome as expressed by the speaker/writer. For ex-
ample, one class of conditionals expresses high cer-
tainty and uses present tense in the if-clause and fu-
ture in the main clause, as in example (2).
(2) If the rain continues, we will return home.
The recognition of conditionals is approached us-
ing a combination of shallow and deep methods. We
first look for lexical triggers of a conditional, such as
the word if at the beginning of a sentence. This first
pass serves as a filter to the next, more expensive
processing step, full parsing of the candidate sen-
tences using Bikel’s statistical parser (Bikel, 2002).
The parse trees are then traversed to identify and
mark the verb forms and the trigger word.
For the input enhancement, we color all relevant
parts of a conditional, namely the trigger and the
verb forms. The Click activity for conditionals re-
quires the learner to click on exactly these parts. The
Practice activity prompts users to classify the condi-
tional instances into the different classes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.754703">
Phrasal verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999494">
Another challenging pattern for English language
learners are phrasal verbs consisting of a verb and
either a preposition, an adverb or both. The meaning
of a phrasal verb often differs considerably from that
of the underlying verb, as in (3) compared to (4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999313">
(3) He switched the glasses without her noticing.
(4) He switched off the light before he went to bed.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927166666667">
This distinction is difficult for ESL learners, who
often confuse phrasal and non-phrasal uses.
Since this is a lexical phenomenon, we ap-
proached the identification of phrasal verbs via a
database lookup in a large online collection of verbs
known to occur in phrasal form.6 In order to find out
about noun phrases and modifying adverbs possibly
occurring in between the verb and its particles, we
run a chunker and use this information in specifying
a filter for such intervening elements.
The visual input enhancement activities targeting
phrasal verbs are the same as for lexical classes, with
the difference that for the Practice activity, learners
have to fill in only the particle, not the particle and
the main verb, since otherwise the missing contents
may be too difficult to reconstruct. Moreover, we
want the activity to focus on distinguishing phrasal
from non-phrasal uses, not verb meaning in general.

pages contain instances of the pattern. The less
frequent the pattern, the less likely we are to find
enough instances of it in web pages returned by the
standard web search engines typically used by learn-
ers to find pages of interest to them. The issue is re-
lated to research on providing learners with texts at
the right level of reading difficulty (Petersen, 2007;
Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008), but the focus for us
is on ensuring that texts which include instances of
the specific language pattern targeted by a given in-
put enhancement are ranked high in the search re-
sults. Ott (2009) presents a search engine prototype
which, in addition to the content-focused document-
term information and traditional readability mea-
sures, supports indexing based on a more general no-
tion of a text model into which the patterns relevant
to input enhancement can be integrated – an idea we
are exploring further (Ott and Meurers, Submitted).

<abstract confidence="0.998569111111111">Second language acquisition research since the 90s has emphasized the importance of supporting awareness of language categories and forms, and input enhancement techniques have been proposed to make target language features more salient for the learner. We present an NLP architecture and webbased implementation providing automatic visual input enhancement for web pages. Learners freely choose the web pages they want to read and the system displays an enhanced version of the pages. The current system supports visual input enhancement for several language patterns known to be problematic for English language learners, as well as fill-in-the-blank and clickable versions of such pages supporting some learner interaction.</abstract>

The current system supports visual input enhancement for several language patterns known to be problematic for English language learners, as well as fill-in-the-blank and clickable versions of such pages supporting some learner interaction. 1 Introduction A significant body of research into the effectiveness of meaning-focused communicative approaches to foreign language teaching has shown that input alone is not sufficient to acquire a foreign language, especially for older learners (cf., e.g., Lightbown and Spada, 1999). Recognizing the important role of consciousness in second-language learning (Schmidt, 1990), learners have been argued to benefit from (Long, 1991) or even require (Lightbown, 1998) a so-called focus on form to overcome incomplete or incorrect knowledge of specific forms or regularities. Focus on form is understood to be “an occasional shift of attention to linguistic code features” (Long and Robinson, 1998, p. 23). 10 In an effort to combine communicative and structuralist approaches to second language teaching, Rutherford and Sharwood Smith (1985) argued for the use of consciousness raisin</context>

Steps 1–4 take place on the server side, whereas step 5 happens in the learner’s browser.1 As NLP is only involved in step 3, we here focus on that step. 1As an alternative to the server-based fetching of web pages, Figure 1: Overall WERTi architecture. Grey components are the same for all patterns and activities, cf. section 2.1. While the first prototype of the WERTi system2 presented at CALICO (Amaral, Metcalf and Meurers, 2006) and EUROCALL (Metcalf and Meurers, 2006) was implemented in Python, the current system is Java-based, with all NLP being integrated in the UIMA framework (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004). UIMA is an architecture for the management and analysis of unstructured information such as text, which is built on the idea of referential annotation and can be seen as an NLP analysis counterpart to current stand-off encoding standards for annotated corpora (cf., e.g., Ide et al. 2000).
