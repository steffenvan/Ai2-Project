Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999883210526316">
Researchers in the biomedical and molecular
biology fields are faced with a wide variety of
information sources. These are presented in
the form of images, free text, and structured
data files that include medical records, gene
and protein sequence data, and whole genome
microarray data, all gathered from a variety of
experimental organisms and clinical subjects.
The need to organize and relate this informa-
tion, particularly concerning genes, has moti-
vated the development of resources, such as
the Unified Medical Language System, Gene
Ontology, LocusLink, and the Online Inheri-
tance In Man (OMIM) database. We describe
a natural language processing application to
extract information on genes from unstruc-
tured text and discuss ways to integrate this
information with some of the available online
resources.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996989365384615">
The current knowledge explosion in genetics and ge-
nomics poses a challenge to both researchers and medi-
cal practitioners. Traditionally, scientific reviews, which
summarize and evaluate the literature, have been indis-
pensable in addressing this challenge. OMIM (Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (OMIM 2000), for ex-
ample, is a clinical and biomedical information resource
on human genes and genetic disorders. It has close to
15,000 entries detailing clinical phenotypes and disor-
ders as well as information on nearly 9,000 genes. The
database can be searched by gene symbol, chromosomal
location, or disorder.
More recently, automated techniques for information
and knowledge extraction from the literature are being
developed to complement scientific reviews. These
methods address the need to condense and efficiently
present large amounts of data to the user. The feasibil-
ity of applying natural language processing techniques
to the biomedical literature (Friedman and Hripcsak
1999; de Bruijn and Martin 2002) and to the wealth of
genomics data now available (Jenssen et al. 2001; Yan-
dell and Majoros 2002) is increasingly being recog-
nized. Efforts to develop systems that work toward this
goal focus on the identification of such items as gene
and protein names (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) or groups
of genes with similar function (Jenssen et al. 2001;
Masys et al. 2001). Other groups are interested in identi-
fying protein-protein (Blaschke et al. 1999; Temkin and
Gilder 2003) or gene-gene interactions (Stephens et al.
2001; Tao et al. 2002), inhibit relations (Pustejovsky et
al. 2002), protein structure (Gaizauskas et al. 2003), and
pathways (Ng and Wong 1999; Friedman et al. 2001).
We discuss the modification of an existing natural
language processing system, SemGen (Rindflesch et al.
2003), that has broad applicability to biomedical text
and that takes advantage of online resources such as
LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. We are pursuing
research that identifies gene-gene interactions in text on
genetic diseases. For example the system extracts (2)
from (1).
1) Here, we report that TSLC1 directly associates
with MPP3, one of the human homologues of a
Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, Discs large
(Dlg).
2) TSLC1|INTERACT_WITH|MPP3
Due to the complexity of the language involved, the
extraction of such predications is currently not accurate
enough to support practical application. However, we
suggest its potential in the context of an application that
combines traditional, human-curated resources such as
OMIM and emerging information extraction applica-
tions.

To support and supplement the information extracted by
SemGen from biomedical text, we draw on two re-
sources, LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. LocusLink
(Wheeler et al. 2004) provides a single query interface
to curated genomic sequences and genetic loci. It pre-
sents information on official nomenclature, aliases, se-
quence accessions, phenotypes, OMIM numbers,
homology, map locations, and related Web sites, among
others. Of particular interest is the Reference Sequence
(RefSeq) collection, which provides a comprehensive,
curated, integrated, non-redundant set of sequences,
including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA), and protein
products for major research organisms. Currently,
SemGen uses LocusLink to obtain normalized gene
names and Gene Ontology annotations.
The Gene Ontology (GO) (The Gene Ontology Con-
sortium 2000, 2001, 2004) aims to provide a dynamic
controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all organ-
isms, even while knowledge of gene and protein func-
tion is incomplete or unfolding. The GO consists of
three separate ontologies: molecular function, biological
process, and cellular component. These three branches
are used to characterize gene function and products and
provide a comprehensive structure that permits the an-
notation of molecular attributes of genes in various or-
ganisms. We use GO annotations to examine whether
there are identifiable patterns, or concordance, in the
function of gene pairs identified by SemGen.

SemGen identifies gene interaction predications based
on semantic interpretation adapted from SemRep (Srini-
vasan and Rindflesch 2002; Rindflesch and Fiszman
2003), a general natural language processing system
being developed for the biomedical domain. After the
application of a statistically-based labeled categorizer
(Humphrey 1999) that limits input text to the molecular
biology domain, SemGen processing proceeds in three
major phases: categorial analysis, identification of con-
cepts, and identification of relations.
The initial phase relies on a parser that draws on the
SPECIALIST Lexicon (McCray et al. 1994) and the
Xerox Part-of-Speech Tagger (Cutting et al. 1992) to
produce an underspecified categorial analysis.
In the phase for identifying concepts, disorders as
well as genes and proteins are isolated by mapping sim-
ple noun phrases from the previous phase to concepts in
the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS)®
Metathesaurus® (Humphreys et al. 1998), using
MetaMap (Aronson 2001). ABGene, a program that
identifies genes and proteins using several statistical and
empirical methods (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) is also
consulted during this phase. In addition, a small list of
signal words (such as gene, codon, and exon) helps
identify genetic phenomena. For example, the genetic
phenomena in (4) are identified from the sentence in (3).
Concepts isolated in this phase serve as potential argu-
ments in the next phase.

<bodyText confidence="0.999858172413793">
During the final phase, in which relations are identi-
fied, the predicates of semantic propositions are based
on indicator rules. These stipulate verbs, nominaliza-
tions, and prepositions that “indicate” semantic predi-
cates. During this phase, argument identification is
constrained by an underspecified dependency grammar,
which also attempts to accommodate coordinated argu-
ments as well as predicates.
SemGen originally had twenty rules indicating one
of three etiology relations between genetic phenomena
and diseases, namely CAUSE, PREDISPOSE, and
ASSOCIATED_WITH. In this project, we extended Sem-
Gen to cover gene-gene interaction relations: INHIBIT,
STIMULATE, AND INTERACT_WITH. About 20 indicator
rules were taken from MedMiner (Tanabe et al. 1999).
We supplemented this list by taking advantage of the
verbs identified in syntactic predications by GeneScene
(Leroy et al. 2003). SemGen has 46 gene-gene interac-
tion indicator rules (mostly verbs), including 16 for
INHIBIT (such as block, deplete, down-regulate); 12 for
INTERACT_WITH (bind, implicate, influence, mediate);
and 18 for STIMULATE (amplify, activate, induce, up-
regulate).
An overview of the SemGen system is given in Fig-
ure 1, and an example is provided below. SemGen proc-
essing on input text (5) produces the underspecified
syntactic structure (represented schematically) in (6).

4 SemGen Evaluation and Error Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921795">
Before suggesting an application using SemGen output,
we discuss the results of error analysis performed on
344 sentences from MEDLINE citations related to six
genetic diseases: Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Crohn’s disease,
lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and sickle
cell anemia. Out of 442 predications identified by Sem-
Gen, 181 were correct, for 41% precision. This is not
yet accurate enough to support a production system;
however, the majority of the errors are focused in two
syntactic areas, and we believe that with further devel-
opment it is possible to provide output effective for
supporting practical applications.
The majority of the errors fall into one of two major
syntactic classes, relativization and coordination. A fur-
ther source of error is the fact that we have not yet ad-
dressed interaction relations that involve a process in
addition to a gene.
Reduced relative clauses, such as mediated by Tip60
in (12), are a rich source of argument identification er-
rors.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953426">
12) LRPICD dramatically inhibits APP-derived in-
tracellular domain/Fe65 transactivation medi-
ated by Tip60.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99929978125">
SemGen wrongly interpreted this sentence as asserting
that LRPICD inhibits Tip60. The rules of the under-
specified dependency grammar that identify arguments
essentially look to the left and right of a verb for a noun
phrase that has been marked as referring to a genetic
phenomenon. Arguments are not allowed to be used in
more than one predication (unless licensed by coordina-
tion or as the head of a relative clause).
A number of phenomena conspire in (12) to wrongly
allow TIP60 to be analyzed as the object of inhibits.
The actual object, transactivation, was not recognized
because we have not yet addressed processes as argu-
ments of gene interaction predications. Further, the
predication on transactivation, with argument TIP60,
was not interpreted, and hence TIP60 was available (in-
correctly) for the object of inhibits. If we had recog-
nized the relative clause in (12), TIP60 would not have
been reused as an argument of inhibits, since only heads
of relative clauses can be reused.
The underspecified analysis on which SemGen is
based is not always effective in identifying verb phrase
coordination, as in (13), leading to the incorrect inter-
pretation that WIF1 interacts with SFRP4.
13) WIF1 was down-regulated in 64% of primary
prostate cancers, while SFRP4 was up-regulated
in 81% of the patients.
A further source of error in this sentence is that
down-regulated was analyzed by the tagger as a past
tense rather than past participle, thus causing the argu-
ment identification phase to look for an object to the
right of this verb form. A further issue here is that we
have not yet addressed truncated passives.

5 Using SemGen to Compare OMIM and
MEDLINE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969653846154">
SemGen errors notwithstanding, we are investigating
possibilities for exploiting automatically extracted gene
interaction predications. We discuss an application
which compares MEDLINE text to OMIM documents,
for specified diseases. LocusLink preferred gene sym-
bols and GO terms are an integral part of this process-
ing. We feel it is instructive to investigate the
consequences of this comparison, anticipating results
that are effective enough for practical application.
We selected five diseases with a genetic component
(Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, lung cancer,
prostate cancer, and sickle cell anemia), and retrieved
the corresponding OMIM report for each disease, auto-
matically discarding sections such as references, head-
ings, and edit history. We also queried PubMed for each
disease and retrieved all MEDLINE citations that were
more recent than the corresponding OMIM report. Both
OMIM and MEDLINE files were then submitted to
SemGen.
For each disease, the MEDLINE file was larger than
the corresponding OMIM file, and the categorizer
eliminated some parts of each file as not being in the
molecular biology domain. Table 1 shows the number
of sentences in the original input files and the number
processed after the categorizer eliminated sentences not
in the molecular biology domain.

We developed a program that compares semantic
predications found in MEDLINE abstracts to those
found in an OMIM report associated with a particular
disease and classifies the comparison between two
predications as either an exact match, partial match, or
no match. The category of a comparison is determined
by examining the argument and predicate fields of the
predications. If all three fields match, the comparison is
an exact match; if any two fields match it is a partial
match. All other cases are considered as no match.
Although fewer than half of the predications ex-
tracted by SemGen are likely to be correct, we provide
some examples from the files on Alzheimer’s disease.

6 Using the GO Terms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999459375">
As noted above, for each gene argument in the predica-
tions identified by SemGen, we retrieved from Locus-
Link the GO terms associated with that gene. We have
begun to investigate ways in which these terms might be
used to compare genes by looking at the gene-gene in-
teraction predications extracted from MEDLINE that
did not occur in OMIM.
To support this work, we developed a program that
sorts gene-gene interaction predications by the GO
terms of their arguments. For each gene function, the
predications in which both arguments share the same
function are listed first. These are followed by the
predications in which only the first argument has that
gene function, and then the predications in which only
the second argument has the relevant gene function. A
typical output file of this process is shown in (19):

The three branches of the Gene Ontology provide a
uniform system for relating genes by function. The
terms in the molecular function and biological process
branches are perhaps most useful for this purpose; how-
ever, we have begun by considering all three branches
(including the cellular component branch). The most
effective method of exploiting GO annotations remains
a matter of research.
It is important to recognize that GO mapping is not
precise; different annotators may make different GO
assignments for the same gene. Nevertheless, GO anno-
tations provide considerable potential for relating the
molecular functions and biological processes of genes.
We consider one of the predications extracted from the
MEDLINE file for prostate cancer that did not occur in
OMIM:
19) EGR1|INTERACT_WITH|AR
Both genes EGR1 and AR in LocusLink elicit the
same human gene set (367 Hs AR; 1026 Hs CDKN1A;
1958 Hs EGR1; 3949 Hs LDLR; 4664 Hs NAB1; 4665
Hs NAB2; 5734 Hs PTGER4; 114034 Hs TOE1). This
suggests a high degree of sequence homology and func-
tional similarity. In addition, LocusLink provides the
following GO terms for the two genes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997716923076923">
20) EGR1: early growth response 1; LocusID: 1958
Gene Ontology: transcription factor activity;
regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent;

ceptor; testicular feminization; spinal and bulb
ar muscular atrophy; Kennedy disease) ; Lo-
cusID: 367 Gene Ontology: androgen receptor

scription factor activity; transport; sex differen-
tiation; regulation of transcription, DNA-
dependent; signal transduction; cell-cell signal-
ing; nucleus
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950057692308">
(The GO provides additional, hierarchical information
for terms, which we have not yet exploited.)
Thirty percent of the predications examined had
some degree of overlap in their GO terms. For example,
the terms for EGR1 (transcription factor activity; regu-
lation of transcription, DNA- dependent; and nucleus)
are identical to three of the GO terms for the AR gene.
This concordance may not be typical of the majority of
paired genes in our sample. However, in the case of
genes that do not exhibit such complete overlap, con-
cordance might be obtained at higher nodes in the clas-
sification scheme.
An alternate approach for assessing distance be-
tween GO annotations has been suggested by Lord et al.
(2003a, 2003b). They propose a “semantic similarity
measure” using ontologies to explore the relationships
between genes that may have associated interaction or
function. The authors consider the information content
of each GO term, defined as the number of times each
term, or any child term, occurs.
The fact that any one gene has a number of GO an-
notations indicates that a particular gene may perform
more than one function or its function may be classified
under a number of molecular activities. Some of these
activities may be part of, i.e. extending to a variable
degree down, the same GO structure. For example, for
gene AR, “receptor activity” (GO 4872) partially over-
laps with “androgen receptor activity” (GO 4882), as
does “steroid binding” (GO 5496) with “transcription
factor activity” (GO 3700), and “signal transduction
(GO 7165) and “cell-cell signaling (GO 7267). This
indicates that in assessing similarity one needs to exam-
ine the ontology structure and not rely solely on the GO
terms.
While we have no experimental evidence, we would
like to speculate about the functional or biological sig-
nificance indicated by similarity in GO annotation.
There are three orthogonal aspects to GO: molecular
function, biological process, and cellular component. If
two genes map more closely in one of the taxonomies,
then their function is necessarily more closely related.
The majority of GO terms are in the molecular function
taxonomy. It is conceivable that genes that map more
closely could be involved in the same cascade or par-
ticipate in the same genetic regulatory network. There is
increasing interest in genetic networks (e.g.
www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ kegg2.html; http://ecocyc.org;
http://us.expasy.org/tools/pathways; www.biocarta.com)
and combining the ability to search and extract informa-
tion from the literature with GO mapping could prove
effective in elucidating the functional interactions of
genes.

To determine whether our automatic comparison of
MEDLINE to OMIM based on SemGen predications
might throw new light on gene-gene interactions, we
examined predications found in the MEDLINE file that
had no match in the OMIM file. We searched the
OMIM reports for information on the genes found in
such predications to confirm that they were absent from
the OMIM reports. For example, while the OMIM re-
port on colon cancer did not mention BARD1, the
SemGen output for MEDLINE had
22) BARD1|INTERACT_WITH|hmsh2
The abstract containing this predication (PMID
11498787) asserts that the BARD1 gene (LocusID 580)
interacts with the breast cancer gene BRCA1 as well as
with hMSH2, a mismatch repair gene associated with
colon cancer. BARD1 shares homology with the two
conserved regions of BRCA1 and also interacts with the
N-terminal region of BRCA1. Interaction of BARD1
with BRCA1 could be essential for the function of
BRCA1 in tumor suppression.
Conversely, disruption of this interaction may possi-
bly contribute to the process of oncogenesis. It has been
reported that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is responsi-
ble for many of the tumor suppression activities of
BRCA1 (Baer and Ludwig 2002). The gene hMSH2
(LocusID 4436) is one of a number of genes that, when
mutated, predisposes to colon cancer type 1. It is the
human homolog of the bacterial mismatch repair gene
mutS. We hypothesize that the interaction of BARD1
with hMSH2, in a similar fashion to BRCA1, may be
necessary for tumor suppression. Disruption of this in-
teraction may increase the likelihood of developing co-
lon cancer. Furthermore, this observation serves to point
toward a possible link between BRCA1 and colon can-
cer.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999916">
We have extended earlier work with SemGen (Rind-
flesch et al. 2003) and are now able to extract from text,
in addition to names of gene and disorders, gene-
disorder and gene-gene relations. Although SemGen is
not at a stage where it can be used indiscriminately and
without selective review and evaluation, it may never-
theless prove useful for reviewers by providing an effi-
cient means of scanning a large number of references
and extracting relations involving genes and diseases.
The process of curation and review is time consum-
ing. Given the rate at which new publications are added
to the scientific literature, the availability of tools for
accelerating the review process would meet a real need.
As demonstrated by our pilot study on six disorders,
SemGen could prove useful, even at this prototype
stage, in extracting relevant information from the litera-
ture concerning genes and diseases. Additionally, the
ability to scan and extract information from diverse sci-
entific domains could play an important role in identify-
ing new relationships between genes and diseases that
would promote hypothesis-generation and advance sci-

These are presented in the form of images, free text, and structured data files that include medical records, gene and protein sequence data, and whole genome microarray data, all gathered from a variety of experimental organisms and clinical subjects. The need to organize and relate this information, particularly concerning genes, has motivated the development of resources, such as the Unified Medical Language System, Gene Ontology, LocusLink, and the Online Inheritance In Man (OMIM) database. We describe a natural language processing application to extract information on genes from unstructured text and discuss ways to integrate this information with some of the available online resources.</abstract>

In this project, we extended SemGen to cover gene-gene interaction relations: INHIBIT, STIMULATE, AND INTERACT_WITH. About 20 indicator rules were taken from MedMiner (Tanabe et al. 1999). We supplemented this list by taking advantage of the verbs identified in syntactic predications by GeneScene (Leroy et al. 2003). SemGen has 46 gene-gene interaction indicator rules (mostly verbs), including 16 for INHIBIT (such as block, deplete, down-regulate); 12 for INTERACT_WITH (bind, implicate, influence, mediate); and 18 for STIMULATE (amplify, activate, induce, upregulate).

The gene hMSH2 (LocusID 4436) is one of a number of genes that, when mutated, predisposes to colon cancer type 1. It is the human homolog of the bacterial mismatch repair gene mutS. We hypothesize that the interaction of BARD1 with hMSH2, in a similar fashion to BRCA1, may be necessary for tumor suppression. Disruption of this interaction may increase the likelihood of developing colon cancer. Furthermore, this observation serves to point toward a possible link between BRCA1 and colon cancer. 8 Conclusion We have extended earlier work with SemGen (Rindflesch et al. 2003) and are now able to extract from text, in addition to names of gene and disorders, genedisorder and gene-gene relations. Although SemGen is not at a stage where it can be used indiscriminately and without selective review and evaluation, it may nevertheless prove useful for reviewers by providing an efficient means of scanning a large number of references and extracting relations involving genes and diseases. The process of curation and review is time consuming. Given the rate at which new publications are added to the scientific literature, the availability of tools for accelerating the revi</context>

Concepts isolated in this phase serve as potential arguments in the next phase. 3) WIF1 was down-regulated in 64% of primary prostate cancers, while SFRP4 was up-regulated in 81% of the patients. 4) genphenom|WIF1 genphenom|SFRP4 During the final phase, in which relations are identified, the predicates of semantic propositions are based on indicator rules.

We discuss the modification of an existing natural language processing system, SemGen (Rindflesch et al. 2003), that has broad applicability to biomedical text and that takes advantage of online resources such as LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. We are pursuing research that identifies gene-gene interactions in text on genetic diseases. For example the system extracts (2) from (1). 1) </context>

However, we suggest its potential in the context of an application that combines traditional, human-curated resources such as OMIM and emerging information extraction applications. 2 Molecular Biology Resources To support and supplement the information extracted by SemGen from biomedical text, we draw on two resources, LocusLink and the Gene Ontology. LocusLink (Wheeler et al. 2004) provides a single query interface to curated genomic sequences and genetic loci. It presents information on official nomenclature, aliases, sequence accessions, phenotypes, OMIM numbers, homology, map locations, and related Web sites, among others. Of particular interest is the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection, which provides a comprehensive, curated, integrated, non-redundant set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA), and protein products for major research organisms. Currently, SemGen uses LocusLink to obtain normalized gene names and Gene Ontology annotations. The Gen</context>
