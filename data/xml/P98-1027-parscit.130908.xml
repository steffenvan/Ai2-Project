an enhancing step for the purpose of its full. and lean
declarative impIe.mentation. .A new insight on
sentential anaphoric processes is presented which may

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997686680412372">
Due to its central role in natural language and .its
intriguing properties, reference and anaphor resolution
has been a central topic for NLP research. Given the
intensive attention devoted. to this subject, .it can
however be said that sentential anaphor processing has
been quite overlooked, when compared to the amount
of research effort put in, tackling non sentential
anaphoric dependencies. This tends to, be so because
there seems to be a more or less. implicit assumption
that no substantial difference exists between the two
processes 1.
While this may. be arguably true for the heuristics
involved in picking out a given antecedent from a list
of suitable candidates, a more subtle point asks itself
to be made when we focus on the syntactic conditions
which sentential anaphoric relations comply with, but
from which non sentential ones are exempt.
In theoretical linguistics these grammatical conditions
are grouped under the heading of Binding Theory. In
computational linguistics however, though there have
been a few papers, directly concerned with the
implementation of this theory, mainstream research
tends, to disregard its conceptual, grammatical or
practical modularity. When it comes to define the
algorithm for setting up the list of suitable candidates
from which the antecedent should be chosen, binding
conditions, holding just at the sentential level, are
most, often put on a, par with any other kind of
conditions, morphological, semantic, pragmatic, etc.,
which hold for anaphonc relations at both sentential
and non sentential level.
The interesting point to be made in this connection is
that, if the modularity of grammatical knowledge is to
be ensured, in a sound reference resolution system,
more attention should be paid to previous attempts ot
implementing Binding Theory. It would then become
evident that this theory, in its current formulation,
appears as a, piece of formalised grammatical
knowledge .which however escapes a full and lean
declarative implementation.
In fact implementation efforts concerning Binding
Theory 2 bring to light what tend to be eclipsed by
mainstream Clean theoretical formulations of it. Behind
the apparent declarative aspect of its definition under
the form of a set of binding principles (plus definitions
of associated concepts, e.g. o-command, o-bound, local

domain, etc.), there is a set of procedures which turn
out to be an essential part of the theory: after parsing
being completed, (i) indexation: assign indices to NPs;
(ii) filtering: store the indexed tree if the indexation
respects binding principles, reject. otherwise; (iii)
recursion: repeat (i) with a new assignment until all
possible assignments are exhausted.
This sort of resistance to declarative encompassing is
also apparent when one considers how Binding Theory
is handled in grammatical theories developed on top of
constraint based formalisms and particularly concerned
with computational implementability, like LFG or
HPSG.
As to HPSG, it has passed quite unnoticed that its
Binding Theory is the only piece of the grammar
fragment not encoded in its own formalism. In the
Appendix of the foundational book (Pollard and Sag
(94)), where the fragment of grammar developed along
its 400 pp. is encoded in the adopted formalism,
Binding Theory escapes such encoding. Bredenkamp
(96) aria Backofen et al. (96) subsequent elaboration on
this issue implied that some kind of essential
limitation of the formalism might have been reached
and that HPSG Binding Theory is still waiting to be
accommodated into HPSG grammars.
As to the LFG formulation of Binding Theory, it
requires the integration of inside-out equations,, a
special purpose extension to the general declarative
formalism. And even though initial scepticism about
their tractability was dissipated by Kaplan and
Maxwell (88), the recent survey of Backofen et al. (96)
reports that no implemented formalism, and no
implemented grammar, is known to handle LFG
Binding Theory.
In this connection the central aim of the research to be
presented here is to render possible. a lean declarative
implementation of Binding Theory in constraint based
formalisms without resorting to specific complex
mechanisms. This involves two steps. First, as a sort
of enhancing step back, a new account of Binding
Theory is set up. Second, by the exhibition of an
example, the new shape of the theory, is shown to
support tull declarative implementation in basic HPSG
formalism. Due to space constraints, this paper is
mostly concerned with the first while the latter
receives just a rough sketch in last section, being
developed in future papers.

<bodyText confidence="0.997769">
Recent cross linguistic research e.g. Xue, Pollard and
Sag (94) and Branco and Marraea (0), has shown that
the binding ability. of long-distance reflexives is not
reducible to recursive concatenation of short distance
relations, as it has been assumed in GB accounts, but
that it is ruled by a fourth binding principle:

This new perspective on long-distance reflexives had
an important impact in the whole shape of Binding
Theory. Branco and Marrafa noted still that the four
principles can be arranged in a classical Aristotelian
square of oppositions, as in (2). This suggests that the
Binding Theory may have an unsuspecled underlying
quantificational structure. The present paper aims at
showing that there is such structure and at determining
its basic lines.

1.2 Phase Quantification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999471205882353">
Barwise and Cooper .(81) seminal work gave rise to a
fruitful research tradition where Generalised Quantifier
Theory has been applied to the analysis of natural
language quantification. These authors suggested that a
universal characterisation of NL nominal quantification
could be formally given by means of formal properties
defined in that theory. The property &amp;quot;to live on&amp;quot; was
postulated as being the most prominent one,
admittedly constituting the common specific nature ot
all nominal quantifiers.
Later, Loebner (87) suggested a criterion to ascertain
the quantificational nature of natural language
expressions in general. That is the property that, for a
one place second order operator Q expressed by a given
euression, there be a corresponding dual operator
This duality based perspective on the essence of natural
language . quantification permitted to extend
quantification well beyond the classic cases of nominal
quantification supported by the determiners all, some,
most, many, etc., namely by covering also the realms
of temporality and possibility. Moreover, items like
already, and others (enough/too, scaling
adjectives, many/few, etc.) though they do not lend
themselves to be straightforwardly analysed in terms of
set quantification, they can also be arranged in a square
of duality. The formalization of the semantics of these
aspectual items by Loebner led to the enlarging of the
notion of quantification through the introduction of the
new concept of phase quantification.
He noted that still and already express duals and that
they are corners of a square of duality. Let P be &amp;quot;she is
asleep&amp;quot; and -P &amp;quot;she is awake&amp;quot;, durative propositions
which are the arguments of the semantic operators
corresponding to already and still. Then:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.82801">
(3) She is already asleep iff
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6668354">
it is not the case that she is still awake.
ALREADY P iff - STILL -P
Further similar tests can be made in order to show that
these aspectual items enter the following square of
duality:

<bodyText confidence="0.891263272727273">

In order to get a formalization of (4), Loebner noted
that alreadyshould be taken as conveying the
information that there is a phase of not-P which has
started before a given reference time tO and might be
followed by at most one phase P which reaches till tO.
This can .be displayed in a time axis by means of the
diagram in (5).

no longer P already P
Similar diagrams for. the meaning of the . other
aspectual phase quantifiers of this square of duality are
easily interpretable. Inner negation results in
exchanging the positive and the negative semiphases,
while outer negation concerns the decision whether the
parameter tO falls into the first or the second
semiphase.
Phase quantifiers in general (already, scaling adjectives,
etc.) were thus charactensed . as requinng two
ingredients: (i) a property P, which defines a positive
phase in a sequence of two opposite phases; (n) a
parameter point. The four types of quantifiers just
differ in presupposing that either the positive or the
negative semiphase comes first and in stating that the
parameter point falls into the first or into the second
semiphase.
Next .Loebner showed that the semantics of phase
quantifiers sketched in the diagrams above can be
formalised in such a way that a square of duality
formed by the generalised quantifiers XX.some&apos;(D,X)/
XX.every (D,X) turns out to he subjacent to the square
of duality of already/still. In order to do it, he just
needed the auxiliary notion of starting point of the
relevant semiphase. &apos;This is rendered as The infimum of
the set of the closest predecessors of .the parameter
point pt which form an uninterrupted linear sequence
with property P, or -P (termed GS1(R,pt) by Loebner):

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997907666666667">
The semantics of the four phase quantifiers above can
then be rendered in the following way, making pt=t0

2 The Logic of Binding
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991211363636364">
Taking Loebner&apos;s view on quantification, our . goal in
this section is to make apparent the quantificational
structure of binding by showing that on a par with the
square of opposition of (2) binding principles form a
square of duality. We are going thus to argue that
binding principles are but the reflex of the phase
quantificationaI nature of corresponding nominal
expressions: reflexives, pronouns, long-distance
reflexives and R-expressions will be shown to express
phase quantifiers acting on the grammatical
obliqueness axis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999303538461538">
In order to show that the above referred nominals
express phase quantifiers the relevant .components
involved in phase quantification should be, identified.
The relevant scale here is not the continuous linear
order of moments of time, as for still/already, but a
discrete partial order made of discourse referents (cf.
DRT) arranged according to the relative obliqueness of
grammatical functions. Note that . in multiclausal
constructions there is the corresponding subordination
of different clausal obliqueness hierarchies (for the sake
of comparability with diagrams (5) involving time

with a turn of 90 right):

The sequence of two opposite semiphases is
defined by a property P. Contrarilyto what happens
with already, where operator (quantifier) and operand
(durative proposition are rendered by different
expressions, in binding phase quantification the
operand P is also contributed by the nominal
expressing the operator, i.e. expressing the binding
phase quantifier.
Fora given nominal N, P is determined by the relative
position of N in the &amp;quot;scale&amp;quot; For a discourse referent r
corres.ponding to N, semiphase P is a linear stretch
containing only elements that are less than or equal to
r in the Obliqueness order, that is discourse referents
corresponding to nominals o-commanding N.
Moreover, if semiphase P is presupposed to precede
semiphase —P, P is such that the last successor in it is
local wrt to r; and if semiphase —P is presupposed to
precedes semiphase P, P is such that the first
predecessor in it is local wrt to r. In both cases the
closest P neighbour of semiphase —P has to be local
wrt r, where the notion of locality has the usual sense
given in the definition of binding principles:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.94156825">
(x-&lt;y or y-&lt;x)) is local wrt r]
As to the parameter point, in binding phase
quantification, it is the discourse referent a which is
the antecedent of r.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999956">
2.2 Binding phase quantifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983337913043478">
We can now formalise phase quantification subjacent
to norninals. . Letus start with an anaphoric
expression N like himself
(11)Kim said Lee thinks Maxi hit himself.
*Kim said Leek thinks Max hit himselfi.
QA: XP.some&apos;(Xx.(GSI(—P,a)&lt;x5a),P)
N can thus be interpreted as presupposing that a
semiphase —P precedes a semiphase P and requiring
that the parameter point occurs. in the latter,_ that is,
the antecedent a is to be found in semiphase P&apos; among
the discourse referents corresponding to the local o-
commanders of r, the disc referent corresponding to INP.
This is captured by the definition of the . phase
quantifier QA. Satisfaction of QA(P) obtains iff
between the bottom of the uninterrupted linear
sequence —P most . close. to the parameter
point/antecedent a and a inclusive there is at least one
discourse referent in P. Given —P.P, this amounts to
requinng that a be in P, and that a be a local o-
commander of r.3
Next,. it is then easy to see how the phase
quantificational force of a pronominal expression N
Should be formalised:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.42861875">
(12) *Kim said Lee thinks Maxi hit him.

QB:XP.no&apos;(Xx.(GSI(—P, a) &lt; x a),P)
a
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.977634655172414">
Here the parameter point a occurs in semiphase
which amounts to the antecedent being picked outside
the set of local o-commanders. QB(P) is satisfied iff no
discourse referent between the bottom of the
uninterrupted. linear sequence —P more close. to the
parameter point/. antecedent a and a inclusive is in P.
Given —P.P, this amounts to requinng that a be in
semiphase —P, and that a be not a local o-commander
of r.
Like in diagram of (11). —P is taken here as the
complement set of P. All discourse referents which are
not localo-commanders . of r are in it, either o-
commanding r or not. Notice that set —P includes also
discourse referents xi...xn introduced by previous
sentences. or the .extra-linguistic context, which, in
constructions similar to (12)b. accounts tor possible
deictic readings of the pronoun. Below, when, studying
R-expressions, we will see why thepossible non
linearity of the obliqueness order will led us . to
consider that —P is slightly more complex than just
the complement set of P.
Coming now to, long-distance reflexives, ruled
by the, fourth binding principle in (1), we get the
following formalisation:
(13)[0 amigo de Kim] i disse que ele proprioi acha que
Lee viq Max. . (Portuguese)
[Kim&apos;s friend]i said LDRi thinks Lee saw Max.

Here, like for short-distance reflexives in (11), a is
required to occur in P though the presupposition now
is that semiphase P is followed by serniphase —P.
Taking into account the definition of P in (10), the
antecedent of N is thus required to be an o-commander
(local or not) of N. The semantics of phase quantifier
Qz is such that, for Qz(P) to be satisfied, between the
bottom of the uninterrupted linear sequence P more
close . to the parameter point/antecedent a and ,a
inclusive every discourse referent is . in P. This
amounts to requiring that a be in semiphase P, and
that a be an o-commander of r.
Finally R-expressions call to be formalised as the
fourth phase quantifier of (7):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.354549">

The parameter point a is required to occur in —P, which
means that a cannot be an o-commander (local or not)
off. This renders the same condition as expressed by
Principle C, that R-expressions be free, though it also
encodes an uncommon assumption about the
referential autonomy of R-expressions. Here, like for
other more obvious dependent reference nominals, the
interpretation of . R-expressions is taken as . being
dependent on the interpretation of other expressions or
on the salience of discourse referents made available by
the communicative context. Taking . an extreme
example in order to support the plausibility of this
view and awkwardly abbreviate a deep philosophical
discussion, one should notice that even a. proper name
is not a unique label of a given individual, once
knowing who is the person called John (out ot those
we know that are named John). depends on the context.
Note .that like in previous diagrams —P is taken in
(14) Just as the complement set of P. However, QC
asks finally for a serious ponderation of this and a
more accurate definition of —P for phase quantification
in non linear orders, where it is possible that not all
elements are comparable.
For Qc(P) to be satisfied, between the bottom of P
and the parameter point/ antecedent a inclusive not
every discourse referent is in P. Since we have here the
presupposition P.—P, and given P is an uninterrupted
linear sequence, this would- amount to requiring that a
be in —P.
It is worth noting then that if we keep —P .simply as
the complement set of P, the interpretation or R-
expressions is however not adequately predicted by
QC(P).

bottom of P. Consequently, every&apos;(D,P) is trivially
true whatever discourse referent xn we take as
antecedent for r, and not every&apos;(D,P) is trivially false.
The interpretation of (15)a. sketched in (15)b. would
thus be incorrectly ruled out.
What these considerations seem then to suggest is
that, when phase quantification operates on non linear
orders, negation of the operand P is slightly more
complex than simple Boolean negation rendering the
complement set. We are thus taught that negation of P
involves also the lifting of the complement set of P,
, with 1 equal to r, the top of P, when P.—P4. It
is easy to check with . diagram (15)c.. that this
specification of —P makes it possible to satisfy QC()

Following Loebner&apos;s claim that logical duality is the
cardinal property to recognise the quantificational
character of natural language expressions, we are thus
led to the view that the interpretation of non
quantificational definite nominals is ruled by their
phase quantificational force over the obliqueness order.
Since the defining formulas . of binding quantifiers
result from (7) just by assigning P the definition in
(10) and taking . the .parameter point pt to be the
antecedent a, it is with. no surprise that we get the

This new conception of binding seems to have
important consequences not only in terms of the
understanding of dlendent reference mechanisms
captured by Binding Theory but also in terms of our
conception of generalised quantification in natural
language, of the twofold semantic capacity of nominal
expressions, referential and quantificational, and maybe
even of the nature of grammar devices. Here we cannot
do but to limit ourselves to hint how a few central
issues usually associated to binding are handled under
this new viewpoint, before we proceed to briefly
consider its consequences for the implementation of
Binding Theory in constraint based grammars.

nominals and their antecedents may be different from
language to language.
Dalrymple (93) pointed out that this is due to language
specific conditions impinging (1) on the eligibility of
the antecedent (whether it is a Subject or not) and 01)
the range of the local domain (Whether it is finite,
tensed, etc.). As to (i), Branco and Marrafa (97) showed
that it is a consequence of a lexical property of the
predicates, whose obliclueness, hierarchy may be either
linear or non linear. As to. (n), this variation may be
accommodated in the definition of property P in (10),
in particular in the definition of &amp;quot;local wrt to r&amp;quot;, to be
provide for each particular languag.e. Both solutions are
perfectly confluent with the UG standpoint that
binding v.ariations across language are the result of
parameterization.
Lexical .gaps4 It is also well known that although
the four binding principles are claimed to be universal
there are languages which have not all the
corresponding four type of nominals. For instance,
English is not known to have long-distance reflexives.
The answer for this becomes now quite .simple: hke
what happens in other squares of duality, it is possible
that not every corner of the square is lexicalized.
Loebner (87) discusses at length the issue. In English,
for instance it is noted that the square of duality
concerning deontic possibility involving right happens
to have only two lexicalized corners, right and duty.
Exemption and logophoricity Also worth
considenng here is the borderline case where the
maximum shrink of semiphase P occurs, i.e. when P
is the singleton whose sole, element is r, the discourse
referent whose interpretation is to be anchored by
finding an antecedent for it.
Given the definition of binding phase, quantifiers, the
maximum shrink of P into a singleton affects
significantly only the quantifiers where the parameter
point/ antecedent a is to be found in P, namely QA and
Qz. In these cases, for a to be in P and the
quantification to be satisfied, a can only be r, r being
thus its own antecedent. Consequently, although the
quantification is satisfied, a.&amp;quot;meaningful&amp;quot; anchoring of
the discourse referent r is still to be accomplished since
by the sole effect of quantification satisfaction r is Just
anchored to itself. . Admittedly, an overarching
interpretability requirement . imposes that the
significant anchoring of nominals be consummated
which induces in present case an exceptional
logophoric effect: for the anaphor (short or long-
distance). to, be interpreted, and given that satisfaction
of its binding constraint is ensured, it should thus
freely . find an antecedent outside any specific
restriction..
This constitutes thus an explanation for the exemption
restrictions in the definitions of Principles A and Z and
so called logophoric effects associated, to exempt
anaphors. Restrictions. which appeared until now to be
mere stipulations receive in this approach a pnncipled
justification.

3.2 ... for a lean implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957034148148148">
The new conception of Binding Theory presented in
this paper is currently being integrated in an HPSG
grammar implemented in ProFIT 1.54.. Space limits
restrict us here to .a very brief rationale of that
implementation, which will be fully presented in
future papers.
The interesting point to note in this connection is that
the new insight into binding phenomena elicited by
the discovery of their quantificational nature seems to
constitute a breakthrough for the desideratum of giving
Binding Theory a lean declarative implementation.
Adopting a principle based semantics in line with
Frank and Reyle (95), the central goal is not anymore
4 Though it is empirically not necessary, for the sake of uniformity,
when —P.P, the order-theoretic dual of this specification of —P can
be assumed.
to filter coindexations between NPs in post-processing
but rather to identify the. relevant sets of discourse
referents against which satisfation of the binding phase
quantification expressed by NPs is checked.
En practical terms that involves first collecting
discourse referents into set values of specific features,
requinng a minor extension to HPSG feature
declaration. Second, given . the possible non local
nature of the elements of a given set, in order to avoid
termination problems some mechanism of delaying
constraint satisfaction has to be ensured.

Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999989454545455">
The research reported here present a cogent argument
for the quantificational nature of sentential dependent
reference relations among nominals. This radically new
conception of binding appears as a decisive step
towards a full lean declarative encompassing of
Binding Theory in constraint based grammars. It may
have also opened new intriguing directions for the
research on natural language generalised quantification
on the apparent twofold semantic capacity of
nominals, referential and quantificational, or on the
nature of grammar devices.
