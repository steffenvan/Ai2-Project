INTRODUCTION

The papers in these proceedings were presented at the ACL-2004 workshop Incremental
Parsing: Bringing Engineering and Cognition Together, held in Barcelona on July 25.
Incremental processing is crucial for many NLP tasks. Language modelling, for instance,
typically requires that probabilities are assigned incrementally as more and more of the speech
stream becomes available. Also, there is substantial evidence showing that humans process
language in an incremental fashion, and thus any cognitively plausible model of human parsing
must take incrementality into account.
The aim of the workshop was to address the dual challenge of defining incremental parsing
models that are useful for engineering tasks such as language modelling, while also contributing to
our understanding and modelling of the human parsing mechanism.
We were pleased to receive 20 submissions, of which we accepted 8 papers for presentation and
3 as reserve papers. Both elements of the workshop theme are well-represented in the proceedings,
with roughly 6 of the papers relating to NLP/language engineering, and 5 relating to cognitive
modelling. We would like to thank the program committee for the excellent job they did in
reviewing the submissions.
As well as 8 paper presentations, we also had talks from two keynote speakers: Brian Roark,
from the Oregon Graduate Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, and Patrick Sturt, from
the Department of Psychology, University of Glasgow. The proceedings include extended abstracts
for these talks.
