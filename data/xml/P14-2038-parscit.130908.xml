<bodyText confidence="0.999926388888889">
When a system fails to correctly recog-
nize a voice search query, the user will fre-
quently retry the query, either by repeat-
ing it exactly or rephrasing it in an attempt
to adapt to the system’s failure. It is de-
sirable to be able to identify queries as
retries both offline, as a valuable quality
signal, and online, as contextual informa-
tion that can aid recognition. We present
a method than can identify retries offline
with 81% accuracy using similarity mea-
sures between two subsequent queries as
well as system and user signals of recogni-
tion accuracy. The retry rate predicted by
this method correlates significantly with a
gold standard measure of accuracy, sug-
gesting that it may be useful as an offline
predictor of accuracy.

With ever more capable smartphones connecting
users to cloud-based computing, voice has been a
rapidly growing modality for searching for infor-
mation online. Our voice search application con-
nects a speech recognition service with a search
engine, providing users with structured answers to
questions, Web results, voice actions such as set-
ting an alarm, and more. In the multimodal smart-
phone interface, users can press a button to ac-
tivate the microphone, and then speak the query
when prompted by a beep; after receiving results,
the microphone button is available if they wish to
follow up with a subsequent voice query.
Traditionally, the evaluation of speech recogni-
tion systems has been carried by preparing a test
set of annotated utterances and comparing the ac-
curacy of a system’s transcripts of those utterances
∗This work was done while the first author was an intern

against the annotations. In particular, we seek to
measure and minimize the word error rate (WER)
of a system, with a WER of zero indicating perfect
transcription. For voice search interfaces such as
the present one, though, query-level metrics like
WER only tell part of the story. When a user is-
sues two queries in a row, she might be seeking the
same information for a second time due to a sys-
tem failure the first time. When this happens, from
an evaluation standpoint it is helpful to break down
why the first query was unsuccessful: it might be
a speech recognition issue (in particular, a mis-
taken transcription), a search quality issue (where
a correct transcript is interpreted incorrectly by the
semantic understanding systems), a user interface
issue, or another factor. As a second voice query
may also be a new query or a follow-up query, as
opposed to a retry of the first query, the detection
of voice search retry pairs in the query steam is
non-trivial.
Correctly identifying a retry situation in the
query stream has two main benefits. The first
involves offline evaluation and monitoring. We
would like to know the rate at which users were
forced to retry their voice queries, as a measure of
quality. The second has a more immediate ben-
efit for individual users: if we can detect in real
time that a new voice search is really a retry of a
previous voice search, we can take immediate cor-
rective action, such as reranking transcription hy-
potheses to avoid making the same mistake twice,
or presenting alternative searches in the user inter-
face to indicate that the system acknowledges it is
having difficulty.
In this paper, we describe a method for the clas-
sification of subsequent voice searches as either
retry pairs of a certain type, or non-retry pairs. We
identify four salient types of retry pairs, describe
a test set and identify the features we extracted to
build an automatic classifier. We then describe the
models we used to build the classifier and their rel-

Previous work in voice-enabled information re-
trieval has investigated the problem of identifying
voice retries, and some has taken the additional
step of taking corrective action in instances where
the user is thought to be retrying an earlier utter-
ance. Zweig (2009) describes a system switching
approach in which the second utterance is recog-
nized by a separate model, one trained differently
than the primary model. The “backup” system is
found to be quite effective at recognizing those
utterances missed by the primary system. Retry
cases are identified with joint language modeling
across multiple transcripts, with the intuition that
retry pairs tend to be closely related or exact dupli-
cates. They also propose a joint acoustic model in
which portions of both utterances are averaged for
feature extraction. Zweig et al. (2008) similarly
create a joint decoding model under the assump-
tion that a discrete sent of entities (names of busi-
nesses with directory information) underlies both
queries. While we follow this work in our usage of
joint language modeling, our application encom-
passes open domain voice searches and voice ac-
tions (such as placing calls), so we cannot use sim-
plifying domain assumptions.
Other approaches include Cevik, Weng and Lee
(2008), who use dynamic time warping to de-
fine pattern boundaries using spectral features, and
then consider the best matching patterns to be re-
peated. Williams (2008) measures the overlap be-
tween the two utterances’ n-best lists (alternate hy-
potheses) and upweights hypotheses that are com-
mon to both attempts; similarly, Orlandi, Culy and
Franco (2003) remove hypotheses that are seman-
tically equivalent to a previously rejected hypoth-
esis. Unlike these approaches, we do not assume a
strong notion of dialog state to maintain per-state
models.
Another consequence of the open-domain na-
ture of our service is that users are conditioned
to interact with the system as they would with a
search engine, e.g., if the results of a search do
not satisfy their information need, they rephrase
queries in order to refine their results. This can
happen even if the first transcript was correct and
the rephrased query can be easily confused for a
retry of a utterance where the recognition failed.

3 Data and Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827323529412">
Our data consists of pairs of queries sampled from
anonymized session logs. We consider a pair of
voice searches (spoken queries) to be a potential
retry pair if they are consecutive; we assume that
a voice search cannot be a retry of another voice
search if a typed search occurs between them. We
also exclude pairs for which either member has no
recognition result. For the purpose of our analy-
sis, we further restricted our data to query pairs
whose second member had been previously ran-
domly selected for transcription. A set of 8,254
query pairs met these requirements and are consid-
ered potential retry pairs. 1,000 randomly selected
pairs from this set were separated out and anno-
tated by the authors, leaving a test set of 7,254 po-
tential retry pairs. Among the annotated develop-
ment set, 18 inaudible or unintelligible pairs were
discarded, for a final development set of 982 pairs.
The problem as we have formulated it requires
a labeling system that identifies repetitions and
rephrases as retries, while excluding query pairs
that are superficially similar but have different
search intents. Our system includes five labels.
Figure 1 shows the guidelines for annotation that
define each category.
The first distinction is between query pairs with
the same search intent (”Is the user looking for
the same information?”) and those with different
search intents. We define search intent as the re-
sponse the user wants and expects from the sys-
tem. If the second query’s search intent is differ-
ent, it is by definition no retry.
The second distinction we make is between
cases where the first query was recognized cor-

rectly and those where it was not. Although
a query that was recognized correctly may be
retried—for example, the user may want to be
reminded of information she already received
(other)—we are only interested in cases where the
system is in error.
If the search intent is the same for both queries,
and the system incorrectly recognized the first,
we consider the second query a retry. We dis-
tinguish between cases where the user repeated
the query exactly, repetition, and where the user
rephrased the query in an attempt to adapt to the
system’s failure, rephrase. This category includes
many kinds of rephrasings, such as adding or drop-
ping terms, or replacing them with synonyms.
The rephrased query may be significantly differ-
ent from the original, as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.85088475">
Q1. Navigate to chaparral ease. (“Navigate to Chiappar-
elli’s.”)
Q2. Chipper rally’s Little Italy Baltimore. (“Chiappar-
elli’s Little Italy Baltimore.”)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987016">
The rephrased query dropped a term (“Navigate
to”) and added another (“Little Italy Baltimore”).
This example illustrates another difficulty of the
data: the unreliability of the automatic speech
recognition (ASR) means that terms that are in
fact identical (“Chiapparelli’s”) may be recog-
nized very differently (“chaparral ease” or “chip-
per rally’s”). In the next example, the recognition
hypotheses of two identical queries have only a
single word in common:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.423843">
Q1. I get in the house Google. (“I did it Google”)
Q2. I did it crash cool. (“I did it Google”)
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9538254">
Conversely, recognition hypotheses that are
nearly identical are not necessarily retries. Often,
these are “serial queries,” a series of queries the
user is making of the same form or on the same
topic, often to test the system.

These complementary problems mean that we
cannot use naive text similarity features to identify
retries. Instead, we combine features that model
the first query’s likely accuracy to broader similar-
ity features to form a more nuanced picture of a
likely retry.
The five granular retry labels were collapsed
into binary categories: search retry, other, and no
retry were mapped to NO RETRY; and repetition
and rephrase were mapped to RETRY. The label

4 Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993358974359">
The features we consider can be divided into three
main categories. The first group of features, sim-
ilarity, is intended to measure the similarity be-
tween the two queries, as similar queries are (with
the above caveats) more likely to be retries. We
calculate the edit distance between the two tran-
scripts at the character and word level, as well as
the two most similar phonetic rewrites. We include
both raw and normalized values as features. We
also count the number of unigrams the two tran-
scripts have in common and the length, absolute
and relative, of the longest unigram overlap.
As we have shown in the previous section, sim-
ilarity features alone cannot identify a retry, since
ASR errors and user rephrases can result in recog-
nition hypotheses that are significantly different
from the original query, while a nearly identical
pair of queries can have different search intents.
Our second group of features, correctness, goes
up a level in our labeling decision tree (Figure 1)
and attempts to instead answer the question: “Was
the first query transcribed incorrectly?” We use
the confidence score assigned by the recognizer to
the first recognition hypothesis as a measure of the
system’s opinion of its own performance. Since
this score, while informative, may be inaccurate,
we also consider signals from the user that might
indicate the accuracy of the hypothesis. A boolean
feature indicates whether the user interacted with
any of the results (structured or unstructured) that
were presented by the system in response to the
first query, which should constitute an implicit ac-
ceptance of the system’s recognition hypothesis.
The length of the interval between the two queries
is another feature, since a query that occurs imme-
diately after another is likely to be a retry. We also
include the difference and ratio of the two queries’
speaking rate, roughly calculated as the number
of vowels divided by the audio duration in sec-
</bodyText>

onds, since a speaker is likely to hyperarticulate
(speak more loudly and slowly) after being misun-
derstood ((Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al., 1996;
Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999; Soltau
and Waibel, 1998)).
The third feature group, recognizability, at-
tempts to model the characteristics of a query that
is likely to be misrecognized (for the first query
of the pair) or is likely to be a retry of a previ-
ous query (for the second query). We look at the
language model (LM) score and the number of al-
ternate pronunciations of the first query, predicting
that a misrecognized query will have a lower LM
score and more alternate pronunciations. In ad-
dition, we look at the number of characters and
unigrams and the audio duration of each query,
with the intuition that the length of a query may
be correlated with its likelihood of being retried
(or a retry). This feature group also includes
two heuristic features intended to flag the “serial
queries” mentioned before: the number of capital-
ized words in each query, and whether each one
begins with a question word (who, what, etc.).

Individually, each feature group peformed sig-
nificantly better than the baseline strategy of al-
ways predicting NO RETRY (62.4%). Each pair
of feature groups performed better than any indi-
vidual group, and the final combination of all three
feature groups had the highest precision, recall,
and accuracy, suggesting that each aspect of the
retry conceptualization provides valuable informa-
tion to the model.
Of the similarity features, the ones that con-
tributed significantly in the final model were char-
acter edit distance (normalized) and phoneme edit
distance (raw and normalized); as expected, re-
tries are associated with more similar query pairs.
Of the correctness features, high recognizer con-
fidence, the presence of a positive reaction from
the user such as a link click, and a long inter-
val between queries were all negatively associated
with retries. The significant recognizability fea-
tures included length of the first query in charac-
ters (longer queries were less likely to be retried)
and the number of capital letters in each query (as
our LM is case-sensitive): queries transcribed with
more capital letters were more likely to be retried,
but less likely to themselves be retries. In addition,
the language model likelihood for the first query
was, as expected, significantly lower for retries.
Interestingly, the score of the second query was
lower for retries as well. This accords with our
finding that retries of misrecognized queries are
themselves misrecognized 60%-70% of the time,
which highlights the potential value of corrective
action informed by the retry context.
Several features, though not significant in the
model, are significantly different between the
RETRY and NO RETRY categories, which affords
us further insight into the characteristics of a retry.
T-tests between the two categories showed that all
edit distance features—character, word, reduced,
and phonetic; raw and normalized—are signifi-
cantly more similar between retry query pairs.1
Similarly, the number of unigrams the two queries
have in common is significantly higher for retries.
The duration of each member of the query pair,
in seconds and word count, is significantly more
similar between retry pairs, and each member of a
retry pair tends to be shorter than members of a no
retry pair. Finally, members of NO RETRY query
pairs were significantly more similar in speaking
rate, and the relative speaking rate of the second
query was significantly slower for RETRY pairs,
possibly due to hyperarticulation.

curacy. This result reflects the fact that although
rephrases conceptually belong in the retry cate-
gory, their characteristics are materially different.
Most notably, all edit distance features are signif-
icantly greater for rephrases. Differences in du-
ration between the two queries in a pair, in sec-
onds and words, are significantly greater as well.
Rephrases also are significantly longer, in seconds
and words, than strict retries. The model includ-
ing only correctness and recognizability features
does significantly better on rephrases than the full
model, identifying them as retries with 25.6% ac-
curacy, confirming that the similarity features are
the primary culprit. Future work may address this
issue by including features crafted to examine the
similarity between substrings of the two queries,
rather than the query as a whole, and by expand-
ing the similarity definition to include synonyms.
To test the model’s performance with a larger,
unseen dataset, we looked at how many retries
it detected in the test set of potential retry pairs
(n=7,254). We do not have retry annotations for
this larger set, but we have transcriptions for the
first member of each query pair, enabling us to cal-
culate the word error rate (WER) of each query’s
recognition hypothesis, and thus obtain ground
truth for half of our retry definition. A perfect
model should never predict RETRY when the first
query is transcribed correctly (WER==0). As
shown in Figure 4, our model assigns a RETRY
label to approximately 14% of the queries follow-
ing an incorrectly recognized search, and only 2%
of queries following a correctly recognized search.
While this provides us with only a lower bound on
our model’s error, this significant correlation with
an orthogonal accuracy metric shows that we have
modeled at least this aspect of retries correctly, and
suggests a correlation between retry rate and tradi-
tional WER-based evaluation.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977545454545">
We have presented a method for characterizing re-
tries in an unrestricted voice interface to a search
system. One particular challenge is the lack of
simplifying assumptions based on domain and
state (as users may consider the system to be
stateless when issuing subsequent queries). We
introduce a labeling scheme for retries that en-
compasses rephrases—cases in which the user re-
worded her query to adapt to the system’s error—
as well as repetitions.
Our model identifies retries with 81% accuracy,
significantly above baseline. Our error analysis
confirms that user rephrasings complicate the bi-
nary class separation; an approach that models
typical typed rephrasings may help overcome this
difficulty. However, our model’s performance to-
day correlates strongly with an orthogonal accu-
racy metric, word error rate, on unseen data. This
suggests that “retry rate” is a reasonable offline
quality metric, to be considered in context among
other metrics and traditional evaluation based on
word error rate.

We look at the language model (LM) score and the number of alternate pronunciations of the first query, predicting that a misrecognized query will have a lower LM score and more alternate pronunciations. In addition, we look at the number of characters and unigrams and the audio duration of each query, with the intuition that the length o</context>

While we follow this work in our usage of joint language modeling, our application encompasses open domain voice searches and voice actions (such as placing calls), so we cannot use simplifying domain assumptions. Other approaches include Cevik, Weng and Lee (2008), who use dynamic time warping to define pattern boundaries using spectral features, and then consider the best matching patterns to be repeated. Williams (2008) measures the overlap between the two utterances’ n-best lists (alternate hypotheses) and upweights hypotheses that are common to both attempts; similarly, Orlandi, Culy and Franco (2003) remove hypotheses that are semantically equivalent to a previously rejected hypothesis. Unlike these approaches, we do not assume a strong notion of dialog state to maintain per-state models. Another consequence of the open-domain nature of our service is that users are conditioned to interact with the system as they would with a search engine, e.g., if the results of a search do not satisfy their information</context>
