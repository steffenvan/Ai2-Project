In this paper, we introduce our recent work
on re-annotating the deep information, which
includes both the grammatical functional tags
and the traces, in a Chinese scientific tree-
bank. The issues with regard to re-annotation
and its corresponding solutions are discussed.
Furthermore, the process of the re-annotation

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999745574074074">
A Chinese scientific Treebank (called the NICT
Chinese Treebank) has been developed by the
National Institute of Information and Communi-
cations Technology of Japan (NICT). This tree-
bank annotates the word segmentation, pos-tags,
and bracketing structures according to the anno-
tation guideline of the Penn Chinese Treebank
(Xia, 2000(a); Xia, 2000(b); Xue and Xia,
2000). Contrary to the Penn Chinese Treebank
in news domain, the NICT Chinese Treebank
includes sentences that are manually translated
from Japanese scientific papers. Currently, the
NICT Chinese Treebank includes around 8,000
Chinese sentences. The annotation of more sen-
tences in the science domain is ongoing.
The current annotation of the NICT Chinese
Treebank is informative for some language
analysis tasks, such as syntactic parsing and
word segmentation. However, the deep informa-
tion, which includes both the grammatical func-
tional tags and the traces, are omitted in the an-
notation. Without grammatical functions, the
simple bracketing structure is not informative
enough to represent the semantics for Chinese.
Furthermore, the traces are critical elements in
detecting long-distance dependencies.
Gabbard et al. (2006) and Blaheta and
Charniak (2000) applied machine learning mod-
els to automatically assign the empty categories
and functional tags to an English treebank.
However, considering about the different do-
mains that the Penn Chinese Treebank and the
NICT Chinese Treebank belong to, the machine
learning model trained on the Penn Chinese
Treebank may not work successfully on the
NICT Chinese Treebank. In order to guarantee
the high annotation quality, in our work, we
manually re-annotate both the grammatical
functional tags and the traces to the NICT Chi-
nese Treebank. With the deep re-annotation, the
NICT Chinese Treebank could be used not only
for the shallow natural language processing
tasks, but also as a resource for deep applica-
tions, such as the lexicalized grammar develop-
ment from treebanks (Miyao 2006; Guo 2009;
Xia 1999; Hockenmaier and Steedman 2002).
Considering that the translation quality of the
sentences in the NICT Chinese Treebank may
affect the quality of re-annotation, in the current
phase, we only selected 2,363 sentences that are
of good translation quality, for re-annotation. In
the future, with the expansion of the NICT Chi-
nese Treebank, we will continue this re-
annotation work on large-scale sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.999934875">
Because the NICT Chinese Treebank follows
the annotation guideline of the Penn Chinese
Treebank, our re-annotation uses similar annota-
tion criteria in the Penn Chinese Treebank.
Figure 1 exemplifies our re-annotation to a
sentence in the NICT Chinese Treebank. In this
example, we first re-annotate the trace (as indi-
cated by the italicized part in Figure 1(b)) for
the extracted head noun ‘词/word’. Furthermore,
we re-annotate the functional tag of the trace (as
indicated by the dashed-box in Figure 1(b)), to
indicate that the extracted head noun should be
restored into the relative clause as a topic.
There are 26 functional tags in the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank (Xue and Xia, 2000), in which
seven functional tags describe the grammatical

roles and one functional tag (i.e. LGS) indicates
a logical subject. Since the eight functional tags
are crucial for obtaining the grammatical func-
tion of constituents, we re-annotate the eight
functional tags (refer to Table 1) to the NICT
Chinese Treebank.

In addition, in the annotation guideline of the
Penn Chinese Treebank, four constructions are
annotated with traces: BA-construction, BEI-
construction, topic construction and relative
clause. The BEI-construction and relative
clause introduce long-distance dependency.
Therefore, we re-annotate the traces for the two
constructions. The topic construction introduces
the topic phrase. For the topic constructions that
contain long-distance dependency, we re-
annotate both the traces and the functional tags
(refer to the italicized part in Figure 2(a)). Some
topic constructions, however, do not include
long-distance dependency. In such cases, we
only re-annotate the functional tag to indicate
that it is a topic (refer to the italicized part in
Figure 2(b)). In addition, the BA-construction
moves the object to a pre-verbal position. Al-
though the BA-construction does not contain
long-distance dependency, we still re-annotate
the trace to acquire the original position of the
moved object in the sentence.

3 Issues and Solutions

3.1 Trace re-annotation in the BA/BEI
construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860363636364">
The NICT Chinese Treebank follows the word
segmentation and pos-tag annotation guideline
of the Penn Chinese Treebank. Therefore, there
are some BA-constructions and BEI-
constructions that cannot be re-annotated with
traces. The principle reason for this is that the
moved object has semantic relations with only
part of the verb. For example, in the sentence
shown in Figure 3(a), the moved head noun ‘家
乡/hometown’ is the object of ‘建/construct’,
but not for ‘建成/construct to be’.

Our analysis of the Penn Chinese Treebank
shows that only a closed list of characters (such
as ‘成/to be’) can be attached to verbs in such a
case. Therefore, we solve the problem by fol-
lowing four steps (for an example, refer to Fig-
ure 3(b)):

(1) A linguist manually collects the characters
that can be attached to verbs in such a case from
the Penn Chinese Treebank and assigns them a
new pos-tag ‘AM (argument marker)’.
(2) The annotators use the character list as a
reference during the re-annotation. When the
verb in a BA/BEI construction ends with a char-
acter in the list, and the annotators think the
verb should be split, the annotators record the
sentence ID without performing any re-
annotation.

sentences, and defines pattern rules to automati-
cally split the verbs in the BA/BEI construc-
tions.

3.2 Topic detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972384615385">
In the annotation guideline of the Penn Chinese
Treebank, a topic is defined as ‘the element that
appears before the subject in a declarative sen-
tence’. However, the NICT Chinese Treebank
does not annotate the omitted subject. Therefore,
we could not use the position of the subject as a
criterion for topic detection.
In order to resolve this issue, we define some
heuristic rules based on both the meaning and
the bracketing structure of phrases, to help de-
tect the topic phrase. Only the phrase that satis-
fies all the rules will be re-annotated as a topic.
The following exemplifies some rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.854759857142857">
(1) If there is a phrase before a subject, the
phrase is probably a topic.
(2) A topic phrase must be parallel to the fol-
lowing verb phrase.
(3) The preposition phrase and localization
phrase describing the location or time are not
topics.

3.3 Inconsistent annotation in the NICT
Chinese Treebank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9771974">
There are some inconsistent annotations in the
NICT Chinese Treebank, which makes our re-
annotation work difficult.
These inconsistencies include:
(1) Inconsistent word segmentation, such as
segmenting the word ‘相对应/corresponding’
into two words ‘相对/opposite’ and ‘应/ought’.
(2) Inconsistent pos-tag annotation. For ex-
ample, when the word ‘的’ exists between two
noun phrases, it should be tagged as an associa-
tive marker (i.e. DEG), according to the guide-
line of the Penn Chinese Treebank. However, in
the NICT Chinese Treebank, sometimes it is
tagged as a nominalizer (i.e. DEC).
(3) Inconsistent bracketing annotation. Fig-
ure 4(a) shows the annotation of a relative
clause in the NICT Chinese Treebank. In this
annotation, the noun phrase ‘大阪/Osaka 地铁
/subway’ is incorrectly treated as the extracted
head; furthermore, the adverb ‘人工/by hand’
that modifies the verb ‘制作/make’ is incor-
rectly annotated as an adjective that modifies the
noun ‘变形图/deformation graph’. After cor-
recting these inconsistencies, the relative clause
should be annotated as shown in Figure 4(b).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994688">
4.1 Annotation Guideline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963923076923">
During the re-annotation, we basically follow
the annotation guideline of the Penn Chinese
Treebank (Xue and Xia, 2000). However, in
order to fit with the characteristics of scientific
sentences in the NICT Chinese Treebank, some
constraints are added to the guideline.
For example, in the science domain, the rela-
tive clause is often used to describe a phenome-
non, in which the extracted head noun is usually
an abstract noun, and the relative clause is an
appositive of the extracted head noun. Figure 5
shows an example in which the relative clause
