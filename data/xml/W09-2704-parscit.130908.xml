Comparative and evaluative question an-
swering (QA) requires a detailed semantic
analysis of comparative expressions and
complex processing. Semantics of predi-
cates from questions have to be translated
to quantifiable criteria before extraction
of information can be done. This paper
presents some challenges faced in answer-
ing comparative and evaluative questions.
An application on the domain of business
intelligence is discussed.

In the recently updated paper by Burger, et al.
(2009), it is indicated that new types of questions
like evaluative and comparative questions must
be targeted in question answering (QA) systems.
Evaluative refers to the consideration of at least
one property or criteria over one or more enti-
ties and the computation of the associated values.
Comparative refers to the evaluation of objects de-
pending on one or more criteria and classifying
those objects depending on the returned values.
Included in comparative is the identification of the
extreme, i.e., the superlatives, the topmost objects.
In such cases, the focus of the questions is on the
properties at stake in the evaluation, leading to
the comparison. Thus, comparative and evaluative
QA involves answering questions that require vari-
ous forms of inference related to evaluation before
an answer can be given. Since evaluation is nec-
essary, the answer is not lifted from source text, as
in the case of answering factoid, definition, or list
questions. Instead, natural language answers will
have to be constructed from the results of numeric
and non-numeric evaluations of the criteria.
Currently, to our knowledge, there are no sys-
tems that answer comparative and evaluative ques-
tions. The closest applications to comparing or

evaluating information are implemented through
natural language database interfaces (Olawsky,
1989) and database queries (e.g., via SQL state-
ments). In the former, the user is prompted to
choose among a set of candidate interpretations of
comparative expressions to indicate his intent. The
comparisons are based on quantifiable predicates
(i.e., those measurable by count, mass, or value).
Using database queries restrict the possible ques-
tions that can be raised and is far less natural and
user-friendly than using human language. It also
does not allow producing cooperative responses.
Recent researches in linguistics on the seman-
tics of comparatives and superlatives (Kennedy,
2006) can be used as a basis in answering com-
parative and evaluative questions. The next sec-
tion discusses some challenges we have identified
as crucial for the development of comparative and
evaluative QA systems. We briefly propose some
research directions we have explored or evaluated.
We end this short document by a few illustrations
from two applications we have worked on during
the past year.

<bodyText confidence="0.977483555555556">
A question analyzer must identify the comparative
expressions in the question and decompose it
into meaningful constituents, among which are
those properties that will be evaluated and the
parameters of the comparison. Issues include:
- Identifying the type of comparison

different properties of different objects (Kennedy,
2006). In some simple situations, comparative
relations in sentences can be extracted automati-
cally via machine learning (Jindal and Liu, 2006).
Their approach determines whether the expression
is non-equal gradable, equative, or superlative.
From this, the type of comparison may be deter-
mined from the semantics of the predicate and the
properties of the objects through the pairability
constraints. In our approach, we want to explore
in more depth semantic and conceptual issues and
their dependence to context, users, and domains.
- Determining semantic meaning and con-
verting to quantifiable measures
The properties at stake in the comparison are
embedded in the semantics of the words in the
question, and possibly in the context that comes
with the question. To date, there is obviously no
widely available lexical resource containing an
exhaustive list of comparative predicates, applied
to precise terms, together with the properties
involved. These can possibly be derived, to a lim-
ited extent, from existing resources like FrameNet
or from an ontology where relationships between
concepts and terms can be mapped. However,
this is tractable for very simple situations, and
in most cases, identifying those properties is
a major challenge. We plan to explore, over
restricted domains, ways to accurately identify
those properties through different resources (like
Generative Lexicon) and elaborate on inferential
models to associate properties for evaluation.
- Determining limits, ranges, and values that
are relative depending on the object
The standard of comparison (i.e., the value) asso-
ciated to the predicate may be different based on
the context, i.e., depending on the object that it is
associated to and on the type of predicate. Prop-
erties of predicates may be underspecified and/or
polysemic and would gain context only when as-
sociated with the object. One such predicate is in-
novative. The following are some properties that
can be used to evaluate innovative.

lished on the same research, number of cita-
tions from other authors
To automatically determine the properties, includ-
ing default values, to be used in the evaluation,
other available sources indicating some range of
values may be tapped, as is done in answer fusion
(Girju, 2001). But rather than retrieving the partial
answer, properties needed for evaluation must
be retrieved or inferred. In terms of values, we
have either numerical values (where comparisons
are quite easy to handle) or textual values (that
are often discrete). It is then necessary to define
comparative scales along basic properties so that
those values get ordered. This is a major challenge
for our project.
- Processing superlatives and other forms of
quantification related to comparisons
Superlatives and other forms of quantifications in
connection with comparative expressions can also
be used on top of the basic evaluative expressions.
As the semantics of the predicate may encompass
multiple properties, strict evaluation of these may
trim the list prematurely. Consider the question:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94409">
• Which companies take the most risk?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976525">
Take most risk entails different dimensions from
being conservative. In the context of business
intelligence, evaluation could be in terms of the
amount of investments, types of products invested
in, the partners being taken, or all of these criteria.
If a strict evaluation of all these criteria is done,
the result may not be complete or accurate. We
are exploring on relaxing the evaluation of mul-
tiple properties before determining the top results
and on evaluating the superlative of each of the
properties so as to identify which of the properties
the object has not met.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996847">
2.2 Answer Determination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759818181818">
Only when the predicate/s is/are decomposed into
properties can proper evaluation take place. We
have two situations: either the QA system is con-
nected to a database (which may have been con-
structed from natural language data as in the case
of economic news) or it searches for the response
on the Web. In the first case, the main challenge is
to convert the concepts of the query into those of
the conceptual schema of the database.
In the second case, relevant data must be
searched on the Web. A straightforward procedure
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993886">

<bodyText confidence="0.999904833333333">
consists of extracting keywords from the ques-
tion, then getting results from search engines from
which, via local grammars associated to proper-
ties, relevant values may be extracted. We already
successfully conducted such an experiment for nu-
merical data fusion (Moriceau, 2006).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996833">
2.3 Response Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994357142857">
The answer cannot be lifted from the source text,
thus a response generator component should be
part of a comparative and evaluative QA system.
As response is to be generated from the results
of numeric and textual comparisons of the crite-
ria, it is necessary to go through complex sentence
generation, involving comparative expressions. In
case the response is not direct, it is also neces-
sary to elaborate adapted forms of cooperativity,
by providing the user with adequate forms of ex-
planations, elaborations, examples (of properties),
and other relevant information. This is clearly a
major challenge, since the quality of the response
will reflect the overall credibility of the system.

3 Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913428571429">
We first carried out a relatively simple experiment
on the business intelligence domain, where the cri-
teria for evaluation are almost an exact science.
The difficulty is to get the expertise in economics
and to formulate it in terms of properties “visible”
in the related economic news. An example ques-
tion is given in (1).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.76988475">
1.Which private biotech
companies in Asia have the
highest number of transactions

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917146341464">
News articles are used as the source of information
to answer these types of questions. They are fac-
tual, structured, and concise. They do not contain
conflicting information, though there is the possi-
bility of updates but the date is normally included
in the information to provide temporal perspective.
Rhetorical relations between sentences are being
explored to give hints as to the relevance of infor-
mation in the sentences. Semantic dependencies
via thematic roles of arguments within each sen-
tence are being considered to extract data. From
the semantic dependency representation, a con-
ceptual representation of these information is cre-
ated using type-feature structure with the follow-
ing information:
Location and Date are complex types contain-
ing info like country and month, respectively.
TransCategory and TransType are transaction cat-
egories and its transaction subtype. There can be
at most ten companies, where each contains infor-
mation like the name and location of the company.
The ContractedItem is also a complex type con-
taining information like worth of the product.
To build this knowledge base, other web sources
are used and a set of inferencing rules is developed
to retrieve and store the required information.
Similarly, questions are represented semanti-
cally using thematic roles. Then, a conceptual rep-
resentation is built to map the question focus with
the answer from the type-feature representation of
the news. To illustrate, the question type-feature
structure contains the following:
For criteria or properties that are already in
the conceptual representation, these are used in
the evaluation and/or comparison. For question
(1), occurrences of each company that fit the con-
straints (e.g., location Asia), are counted and the
resulting values are compared to determine the top
companies.
However, in (2), the sample question involves a
non-directly translatable predicate.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.861878">
2.Does Company X take more risks
than Company Y?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999725777777778">
Non-directly translatable predicates can be quan-
tifiable by one criterion (e.g., active company:
company with above-mean number of transac-
tions), quantifiable by multiple criteria (e.g., com-
pany that take-risk: active company that has trans-
actions every year, and has alliances every year
but always with new partners or has unstable part-
ners), polysemous (e.g., stable can mean ability to
resist motion, steady in purpose, or established),
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99782">

<bodyText confidence="0.999372153846154">
and/or underspecified (e.g., stable company vs.
stable partner, though partner is also a company,
the criteria is not the same. Stable company is an
active company that may not have alliances every
year or have alliances every year but always with
old partners, whereas a stable partner is a company
with alliances every year). There is also the issue
of metonymy. In the context of company, the set
of quantifiable properties associated to company
could be number of employees, number of transac-
tions, type of partners, and so on. Choosing which
of these properties to associate to evaluate a pred-
icate (like stable) is a challenge.
In this application, the categories, classifica-
tions, boundaries (what the term entails), and eval-
uation criteria of the terms are defined by an ex-
pert, so the result is consistent and objective. The
challenge is to analyze the given information and
convert it to machine tractable instructions. At
present, set theory is used to define constraints and
to generate the answer. It should be noted that it
is one expert’s interpretation of the terminologies
used in the constraints. Others may have different
criteria to associate with the predicates.
Other domains, like tourism, may be more chal-
lenging. Aside from information sources being not
purely textual (i.e., some may be in tables or di-
agrams), the evaluation criteria for questions (3)
and (4) may be subjective and may produce con-
flicting results. For example, value for money
is subjective since certain amenities may not be
important to the user. This can be resolved by
prompting the user for additional criteria, by hav-
ing a user profile, or by comparing with other enti-
ties (in this case, other hotels) to determine what is
considered the norm (as a gauge to what is excep-
tional). It is also possible to generate different re-
sults based on the various criteria and present these
to the user with explanations on the basis used.
3.Which hotels in Singapore
offer the most value for money
for stay from August 28, 2009?
4.Which Asian cities are most
kid-friendly?
5. Which hotels in Asia are most
kid-friendly?
As mentioned, the properties at stake in the eval-
uation could be different if the question focus was
changed, as in the case of “kid-friendly” in ques-
tion (5). In question (4), the criteria for a kid-
friendly city could be one with avenues for fun
and entertainment (like theme parks, zoos, parks)
and a city with low crime rate (or specifically, low
child abuse rate). On the other hand, a kid-friendly
hotel would be one with amenities for supervised
or planned activities, proximity to entertainment
venues, larger rooms, or special menu for kids.
The criteria or properties cannot be easily and re-
liably accessed from an ontology. Our challenge
here is to elaborate means to get those properties.
A direction we are investigating includes learn-
ing these properties from the web, but we may be
faced with the recurrent problem of data sparse-
ness, besides the fact that the web contains many
erroneous statements.

Instead, natural language answers will have to be constructed from the results of numeric and non-numeric evaluations of the criteria. Currently, to our knowledge, there are no systems that answer comparative and evaluative questions. The closest applications to comparing or Rachel Roxas De La Salle University-Manila 2401 Taft Avenue, Manila, Philippines rachel.roxas@dlsu.edu.ph evaluating information are implemented through natural language database interfaces (Olawsky, 1989) and database queries (e.g., via SQL statements). In the former, the user is prompted to choose among a set of candidate interpretations of comparative expressions to indicate his intent. The comparisons are based on quantifiable predicates (i.e., those measurable by count, mass, or value). Using database queries restrict the possible questions that can be raised and is far less natural and user-friendly than using human language. It also does not allow producing cooperative responses. Recent researches in linguistics on the semantics of comparatives and superlatives (Kennedy, 2006) can be use</context>
