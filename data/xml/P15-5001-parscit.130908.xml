1 Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997880625">
Historically Natural Language Processing (NLP)
focuses on unstructured data (speech and text)
understanding while Data Mining (DM) mainly
focuses on massive, structured or semi-structured
datasets. The general research directions of these
two fields also have followed different philoso-
phies and principles. For example, NLP aims at
deep understanding of individual words, phrases
and sentences (“micro-level”), whereas DM aims
to conduct a high-level understanding, discovery
and synthesis of the most salient information
from a large set of documents when working on
text data (“macro-level”). But they share the
same goal of distilling knowledge from data. In
the past five years, these two areas have had in-
tensive interactions and thus mutually enhanced
each other through many successful text mining
tasks. This positive progress mainly benefits
from some innovative intermediate representa-
tions such as “heterogeneous information net-
works” [Han et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012b].
However, successful collaborations between
any two fields require substantial mutual under-
standing, patience and passion among research-
ers. Similar to the applications of machine learn-
ing techniques in NLP, there is usually a gap of
at least several years between the creation of a
new DM approach and its first successful appli-
cation in NLP. More importantly, many DM ap-
proaches such as gSpan [Yan and Han, 2002]
and RankClus [Sun et al., 2009a] have demon-
strated their power on structured data. But they
remain relatively unknown in the NLP communi-
ty, even though there are many obvious potential
applications. On the other hand, compared to
DM, the NLP community has paid more atten-
tion to developing large-scale data annotations,
resources, shared tasks which cover a wide range
of multiple genres and multiple domains. NLP
can also provide the basic building blocks for
many DM tasks such as text cube construction
[Tao et al., 2014]. Therefore in many scenarios,
for the same approach the NLP experiment set-
ting is often much closer to real-world applica-
tions than its DM counterpart.
We would like to share the experiences and les-
sons from our extensive inter-disciplinary col-
laborations in the past five years. The primary
goal of this tutorial is to bridge the knowledge
gap between these two fields and speed up the
transition process. We will introduce two types
of DM methods: (1). those state-of-the-art DM
methods that have already been proven effective
for NLP; and (2). some newly developed DM
methods that we believe will fit into some specif-
ic NLP problems. In addition, we aim to suggest
some new research directions in order to better
marry these two areas and lead to more fruitful
outcomes. The tutorial will thus be useful for
researchers from both communities. We will try
to provide a concise roadmap of recent perspec-
tives and results, as well as point to the related
DM software and resources, and NLP data sets
that are available to both research communities.

Then we will focus on introducing a series of
effective DM methods which have already been
adopted for NLP applications. The most fruitful
research line exploited Heterogeneous Infor-
mation Networks [Tao et al., 2014; Sun et al.,
2009ab, 2011, 2012ab, 2013, 2015]. For exam-
ple, the meta-path concept and methodology
[Sun et al., 2011] has been successfully used to
address morph entity discovery and resolution
[Huang et al., 2013] and Wikification [Huang et
al., 2014]; the Co-HITS algorithm [Deng et al.,
2009] was applied to solve multiple NLP prob-
lems including tweet ranking [Huang et al.,
2012] and slot filling validation [Yu et al., 2014].
We will synthesize the important aspects learned
from these successes.

2.3 New DM Methods Promising for NLP

<bodyText confidence="0.9997124">
Then we will introduce a wide range of new DM
methods which we believe are promising to NLP.
We will align the problems and solutions by cat-
egorizing their special characteristics from both
the linguistic perspective and the mining per-
spective. One thread we will focus on is graph
mining. We will recommend some effective
graph pattern mining methods [Yan and Han,
2002&amp;2003; Yan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010]
and their potential applications in cross-
document entity clustering and slot filling. Some
recent DM methods can also be used to capture
implicit textual cues which might be difficult to
generalize using traditional syntactic analysis.
For example, [Kim et al., 2011] developed a syn-
tactic tree mining approach to predict authors
from papers, which can be extended to more
general stylistic analysis. We will carefully sur-
vey the major challenges and solutions that ad-
dress these adoptions.
