1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943794117647">
Every language contains complex expressions
that are language-specific. The general prob-
lem when trying to build automated translation
systems or human-readable dictionaries is to de-
tect expressions that can be used idiomatically
and then whether the expressions can be used
idiomatically in a particular text, or whether
a literal translation would be preferred. It fol-
lows from the definition of idiomatic expression
that when a complex expression is used idiomat-
ically, it contains at least one element which is
semantically &amp;quot;out of context&amp;quot;. In this paper,
we discuss a method that finds idiomatic col-
locations in a text corpus. The method detects
semantic asymmetry by taking advantage of dif-
ferences in syntactic distributions.
We demonstrate the method using a spe-
cific linguistic phenomenon, verb-object collo-
cations. The asymmetry between a verb and its
object is the focus in our work, and it makes the
approach different from the methods that use
e.g. mutual information, which is a symmetric
measure.
Our novel approach differs from mutual infor-
mation and the so-called t-value measures that
have been widely used for similar tasks, e.g.,
Church et al. (1994) and Breidt (1993) for Ger-
man. The tasks where mutual information can
be applied are very different in nature as we
see in the short comparison at the end of this
paper. The work reported in Grefenstette and
Teufel (1995) for finding empty support verbs
used in nominalisations is also related to the
present work.

2 Semantic asymmetry
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998721846153846">
The linguistic hypothesis that syntactic rela-
tions, such as subject-verb and object-verb re-
lations, are semantically asymmetric in a sys-
tematic way (Keenan, 1979) is well-known. Mc-
Glashan (1993, p. 213) discusses Keenan&apos;s prin-
ciples concerning directionality of agreement re-
lations and concludes that semantic interpreta-
tion of functor categories varies with argument
categories, but not vice versa. He cites Keenan
who argues that the meaning of a transitive verb
depends on the object, for example the mean-
ing of the verb cut seems to vary with the direct
object:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9987654">
• in cut finger &amp;quot;to make an incision on the
surface of&amp;quot;,
• in cut cake &amp;quot;to divide into portions&amp;quot;,
• in cut lawn &amp;quot;to trim&amp;quot; and
• in cut heroin &amp;quot;diminish the potency&amp;quot;.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746888888889">
This phenomenon is also called semantic tailor-
ing (Allerton, 1982, p. 27).
There are two different types of asymmetric
expressions even if they probably form a con-
tinuum: those in which the sense of the functor
is modified or selected by a dependent element
and those in which the functor is semantically
empty. The former type is represented by the
verb cut above: a distinct sense is selected ac-
cording to the (type of) object. The latter type
contains an object that forms a fixed collocation
with a semantically empty verb. These pairings
are usually language-specific and semantically
unpredictable.
Obviously, the amount of tailoring varies con-
siderably. At one end of the continuum is id-
iomatic usage. It is conceivable that even a
highly idiomatic expression like taking toll can

<bodyText confidence="0.999716555555555">
be used non-idiomatically. There may be texts
where the word toll is used non-idiomatically, as
it also may occur from time to time in any text
as, for instance, in The Times corpus: The IRA
could be profiting by charging a toll for cross-
border smuggling. But when it appears in a
sentence like Barcelona&apos;s fierce summer is tak-
ing its toll, it is clearly a part of an idiomatic
expression.

3 Distributed frequency of an object
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763974358974">
As the discussion in the preceding chapter
shows, we assume that when there is a verb-
object collocation that can be used idiomati-
cally, it is the object that is the more interesting
element. The objects in idiomatic usages tend
to have a distinctive distribution. If an object
appears only with one verb (or few verbs) in a
large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic
nature. The previous example of take toll is il-
lustrative: if the word toll appears only with the
verb take but nothing else is done with tolls, we
may then assume that it is not the toll in the
literary sense that the text is about.
The task is thus to collect verb-object colloca-
tions where the object appears in a corpus with
few verbs; then study the collocations that are
topmost in the decreasing order of frequency.
The restriction that the object is always at-
tached to the same verb is too strict. When
we applied it to ten million words of newspaper
text, we found out that even the most frequent
of such expressions, make amends and take
precedence, appeared less than twenty times,
and the expressions have temerity, go berserk
and go ex-dividend were even less frequent. It
was hard to obtain more collocations because
their frequency went very low. Then expres-
sions like have appendix were equivalently ex-
posed with expressions like run errand.
Therefore, instead of taking the objects that
occur with only one verb, we take all objects and
distribute them over their verbs. This means
that we are concerned with all occurrences of an
object as a block, and give the block the score
that is the frequency of the object divided by
the number of different verbs that appear with
the object.
The formula is now as follows. Let o be an
object and let
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.862619">
(F17 V1) 0), • • • (Fn7 Vny
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949378378378">
be triples where Fi &gt; 0 is the frequency or the
relative frequency of the collocation of o as an
object of the verb Vi in a corpus. Then the score
for the object o is the sum ELI Fkln.
The frequency of a given object is divided by
the number of different verbs taking this given
object. If the number of occurrences of a given
object grows, the score increases. If the object
appears with many different verbs, the score de-
creases. Thus the formula favours common ob-
jects that are used in a specific sense in a given
corpus.
This scheme still needs some parameters.
First, the distribution of the verbs is not taken
into account. The score is the same in the
case where an object occurs with three different
verbs with the frequencies, say, 100, 100, and
100, and in the case where the frequencies of
the three heads are 280, 10 and 10. In this case,
we want to favour the latter object, because
the verb-object relation seems to be more stable
with a small number of exceptions. One way to
do this is to sum up the squares of the frequen-
cies instead of the frequencies themselves.
Second, it is not clear what the optimal
penalty is for multiple verbs with a given ob-
ject. This may be parametrised by scaling the
denominator of the formula. Third, we intro-
duce a threshold frequency for collocations so
that only the collocations that occur frequently
enough are used in the calculations. This last
modification is crucial when an automatic pars-
ing system is applied because it eliminates in-
frequent parsing errors.
The final formula for the distributed fre-
quency DF(o) of the object o in a corpus of
n triples (Fi, Vi, o) with Fi &gt; C is the sum

where a, b and C are constants that may depend
on the corpus and the parser.

4.1 The syntactic parser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987">
We used the Conexor Functional Depen-
dency Grammar (FDG) by Tapanainen and
Jarvinen (1997) for finding the syntactic rela-
tions. The new version of the syntactic parser
can be tested at http://www.conexor.fi.

4.2 Processing the corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960588235294">
We analysed the corpora with the syntactic
parser and collected the verb-object collocations
from the output. The verb may be in the infini-
tive, participle or finite form. A noun phrase in
the object function is represented by its head.
For instance, the sentence I saw a big black cat
generates the pair (see, cat). A verb may also
have an infinitive clause as its object. In such a
case, the object is represented by the infinitive,
with the infinitive marker if present. Naturally,
transitive nonfinite verbs can have objects of
their own. Therefore, for instance, the sentence
I want to visit Paris generates two verb-objects
pairs: (want, to visit) and (visit, Paris). The
parser recognises also clauses, e.g. that-clauses,
as objects.
We collect the verbs and head words of nom-
inal objects from the parser&apos;s output. Other
syntactic arguments are ignored. The output
is normalised to the baseforms so that, for in-
stance, the clause He made only three real mis-
takes produces the normalised pair: (make,
mistake). The tokenisation in the lexical anal-
ysis produces some &amp;quot;compound nouns&amp;quot; like
vice +president, which are glued together. We
regard these compounds as single tokens.
The intricate borderline between an object,
object adverbial and mere adverbial nominal is
of little importance here, because the latter tend
to be idiomatic anyway. More importantly, due
to the use of a syntactic parser, the presence of
other arguments, e.g. subject, predicative com-
plement or indirect object, do not affect the re-
sult.

In our experiment, we used some ten mil-
lion words from a The Times newspaper cor-
pus, taken from the Bank of English corpora
(Jarvinen, 1994). The overall quality of the re-
sult collocations is good. The verb-object collo-
cations with highest distributed object frequen-
cies seem to be very idiomatic (Table 1).
The collocations seem to have different status
in different corpora. Some collocations appear
in every corpus in a relatively high position. For
example, collocations like take toll, give birth
and make mistake are common English expres-
sions.
Some other collocations are corpus spe-

The first impression, when comparing Ta-
bles 1 and 2, is that the collocations in the latter
are somewhat more marginal though clearly se-
mantically motivated. The second observation
is that the top collocations contain mostly rare
words and parsing errors made by the underly-
ing syntactic parser; three out of the top five
pairs are parsing errors.
We tested how the top ten pairs of Table 1 are
rated by mutual information. The result is in
Table 3 where the position denotes the position
when sorted according to mutual information
and filtered by the t-value. The t-value is se-
lected so that it does not filter out the top pairs
in Table 1. Without filtering, the positions are
in range between 32 640 and 158091. The re-
sult shows clearly how different the nature of
mutual information is. Here it seems to favour
pairs that we would like to rule out and vice
versa.

In a related piece of work, Hindle (1994) used a
parser to study what can be done with a given
noun or what kind of objects a given verb may
get. If we collect the most frequent objects for
the verb have, we are answering the question:
&amp;quot;What do we usually have?&amp;quot; (see Table 4). The
distributed frequency of the object gives a dif-
ferent flavour to the task: if we collect the collo-
cations in the order of the distributed frequency
of the object, we are answering the question:
&amp;quot;What do we only have?&amp;quot; (see Table 5).

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899666666667">
This paper was concerned with the semantic
asymmetry which appears as syntactic asym-
metry in the output of a syntactic parser. This
asymmetry is quantified by the presented dis-
tributed frequency function. The function can
be used to collect and sort the collocations so
that the (verb-object) collocations where the
asymmetry between the elements is the largest
come first. Because the semantic asymmetry is
related to the idiomaticity of the expressions,
we have obtained a fully automated method to
find idiomatic expressions from large corpora.

The method detects semantic asymmetry by taking advantage of differences in syntactic distributions. We demonstrate the method using a specific linguistic phenomenon, verb-object collocations. The asymmetry between a verb and its object is the focus in our work, and it makes the approach different from the methods that use e.g. mutual information, which is a symmetric measure. Our novel approach differs from mutual information and the so-called t-value measures that have been widely used for similar tasks, e.g., Church et al. (1994) and Breidt (1993) for German. The tasks where mutual information can be applied are very different in nature as we see in the short comparison at the end of this paper.

The method detects semantic asymmetry by taking advantage of differences in syntactic distributions. We demonstrate the method using a specific linguistic phenomenon, verb-object collocations. The asymmetry between a verb and its object is the focus in our work, and it makes the approach different from the methods that use e.g. mutual information, which is a symmetric measure. Our novel approach differs from mutual information and the so-called t-value measures that have been widely used for similar tasks, e.g., Church et al. (1994) and Breidt (1993) for German. The tasks where mutual information can be applied are very different in nature as we see in the short comparison at the end of this paper. The work reported in Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) for finding empty support verbs used in nominalisations is also related to the present work. • Email: Pasi.

If we collect the most frequent objects for the verb have, we are answering the question: &amp;quot;What do we usually have?&amp;quot; (see Table 4). The distributed frequency of the object gives a different flavour to the task: if we collect the collocations in the order of the distributed frequency of the object, we are answering the question: &amp;quot;What do we only have?&amp;quot; (see Table 5). 8 Conclusion This paper was concerned with the semantic asymmetry which appears as syntactic asymmetry in the output of a synt</context>

We regard these compounds as single tokens. The intricate borderline between an object, object adverbial and mere adverbial nominal is of little importance here, because the latter tend to be idiomatic anyway. More importantly, due to the use of a syntactic parser, the presence of other arguments, e.g. subject, predicative complement or indirect object, do not affect the result. 5 Experiments In our experiment, we used some ten million words from a The Times newspaper corpus, taken from the Bank of English corpora (Jarvinen, 1994). The overall quality of the result collocations is good. The verb-object collocations with highest distributed object frequencies seem to be very idiomatic (Table 1). The collocations seem to have different status in different corpora. Some collocations appear in every corpus in a relatively high position. For example, collocations like take toll, give birth and make mistake are common English expressions. Some other collocations are corpus speDF(o) F(vo) verb + object 37.50 73 take toll 28.00 28 go bust 25.00 25 make plain 24.83 60 mark anniversary 22.00 22 finish seventh 21.00 21 make inroa</context>

This last modification is crucial when an automatic parsing system is applied because it eliminates infrequent parsing errors. The final formula for the distributed frequency DF(o) of the object o in a corpus of n triples (Fi, Vi, o) with Fi &gt; C is the sum 71b k =1 where a, b and C are constants that may depend on the corpus and the parser. 4 The corpora and parsing 4.1 The syntactic parser We used the Conexor Functional Dependency Grammar (FDG) by Tapanainen and Jarvinen (1997) for finding the syntactic relations. The new version of the syntactic parser can be tested at http://www.conexor.fi. 1290 4.2 Processing the corpora We analysed the corpora with the syntactic parser and collected the verb-object collocations from the output. The verb may be in the infinitive, participle or finite form. A noun phrase in the object function is represented by its head. For instance, the sentence I saw a big black cat generates the pair (see, cat). A verb may also have an infinitive clause as its object. In such a case, the object is represented by the infinitive, with the infini</context>
