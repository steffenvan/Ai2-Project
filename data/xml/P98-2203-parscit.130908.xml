Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999879235294118">
The paper argues that language change can
be explained through the stochasticity observed
in real-world natural language use. This the-
sis is demonstrated by modeling language use
through language games played in an evolv-
ing population of agents. We show that the
artificial languages which the agents sponta-
neously develop based on self-organisation, do
not evolve even if the population is changing.
Then we introduce stochasticity in language use
and show that this leads to a constant innova-
tion (new forms and new form-meaning associ-
ations) and a maintenance of variation in the
population, if the agents are tolerant to varia-
tion. Some of these variations overtake existing
linguistic k conventions, particularly in changing
populations, thus explaining lexicon change.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999975283333334">
Natural language evolution takes place at all
levels of language (McMahon, 1994). This is
partly due to external factors such as language
contact between different populations or the
need to express new meanings or support new
modes of interaction with language. But it
is well-established that language also changes
spontaneously based on an internal dynam-
ics (Labov, 1994). For example, many sound
changes, like from /b/ to /p/, /d/ to /t/, and
/g/ to /k/, which took place in the evolution
from proto-Indo-European to Modern Germanic
languages, do not have an external motivation.
Neither do many shifts in the expression of
meanings. For example, the expression of fu-
ture tense in English has shifted from &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot;
to &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;, even though &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot; was perfectly
suited and &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; meant something else (namely
&amp;quot;wanting to&amp;quot;). Similarly, restructuring of the
grammar occurs without any apparent reason.
For example, in Modern English the auxiliaries
come before the main verb, whereas in Old En-
glish after it Che conquered be would&apos; (Old
English) vs. &apos;he would be conquered&apos; (Mod-
ern English)). This internal, apparently non-
functional evolution of language has been dis-
cussed widely in the linguistic literature, lead-
ing some linguists to strongly reject the possi-
bility of evolutionary explanations of language
(Chomsky, 1990).
In biological systems, evolution takes place
because [1] a population shows natural varia-
tion, and [2] the distribution of traits in the
population changes under the influence of selec-
tion pressures present in the environment. Note
that biological variation is also non-functional.
Natural selection acts post factum as a selecting
agent, pushing the population in certain direc-
tions, but the novelty is created independently
of a particular goal by stochastic forces oper-
ating during genetic transmission and develop-
ment. Our hypothesis is that the same applies
to language, not at the genetic but at the cul-
tural level. We hypothesise that language for-
mation and evolution take place at the level of
language itself, without any change in the ge-
netic make up of the agents. Language recruits
and exploits available brain capacities of the
agents but does not require any capacity which
is not already needed for other activities (see
also (Batali, 1998), (Kirby and Hurford, 1997)).
The present paper focuses on the lexicon. It
proposes a model to explain spontaneous lexi-
con evolution, driven solely by internal factors.
In order to have any explanatory force at all,
we cannot put into the model the ingredients
that we try to explain. Innovation, mainte-
nance of variation, and change should follow
as emergent properties of the operation of the
model. Obtaining variation is not obvious, be-

cause a language community should also have a
natural tendency towards coherence, otherwise
communication would not be effective. An ade-
quate explanatory model of lexicon change must
therefore show [1] how a coherent lexicon may
arise in a group of agents, [2] how nevertheless
the lexicon may remain internally varied and ex-
hibit constant innovation, and [3] how some of
this variation may be amplified to become dom-
inant in the population. These three quite dif-
ficult challenges are taken up in the next three
sections of the paper.
2 How a coherent lexicon may arise
To investigate concretely how a lexicon may
originate, be transmitted from one generation
to the next, and evolve, we have developed a
minimal model of language use in a dynam-
ically evolving population, called the naming
game (Steels, 1996). The naming game has
been explored through computational simula-
tions and is related to systems proposed and
investigated by (Oliphant, 1996), (MacLennan,
1991), (Werner and Dyer, 1991), a.o. It has even
been implemented on robotic agents who de-
velop autonomously a shared lexicon grounded
in their sensori-motor experiences (Steels and
Vogt, 1997), (Steels, 1997). The naming game
focuses on associating form and meaning. Ob-
viously in human natural languages both form
and meaning are non-atomic entities with com-
plex internal structure, but the results reported
here do not depend on this internal complexity.
We assume a set of agents A where each
agent a E A has contact with a set of ob-
jects 0 = {oo, on}. The set of objects
constitutes the environment of the agents. A
word is a sequence of letters randomly drawn
from a finite alphabet. The agents are all as-
sumed to share the same alphabet. A lexicon ,C
is a time-dependent relation between objects,
words, and a score. Each agent a E A has
his own set of words Wti,t and his own lexicon
La,t C Ca X Wcht X which is initially empty.
An agent a is therefore defined at a time t as a
pair at =&lt; Wa,t, La,t &gt;. There is the possibil-
ity of synonymy and homonymy: An agent can
associate a single word with several objects and
a given object with several words. It is not re-
quired that all agents have at all times the same
set of words and the same lexicon.
We assume that environmental conditions
identify a context C c 0. The speaker selects
one object as the topic of this context fs E C.
He signals this topic using extra-linguistic com-
munication (such as through pointing). Based
on the interpretation of this signalling, the
hearer constructs an object score 0.0 &lt; e, &lt; 1.0
for each object o E C reflecting the likelihood
that o is the speaker&apos;s topic. If there is absolute
certainty, one object has a score of 1.0 and the
others are all 0.0. If there is no extra-linguistic
communication, the likelihood of all objects is
the same. If there is only vague extra-linguistic
communication, the hearer has some idea what
the topic is, but with less certainty. The mean-
ing scope parameter am determines the number
of object candidates the hearer is willing to con-
sider. The meaning focus parameter Om deter-
mines the tolerance to consider objects that are
not the center of where the speaker pointed to.
In the experiments reported in this paper, the
object-score is determined by assuming that all
objects are positioned on a 2-dimensional grid.
The distance d between the topic and the other
objects determines the object-score, such that
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99122475">
1 (1)
eobject =
1+ (-ci--)2
Om
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746">
Om is the meaning focus factor.
To name the topic, the speaker retrieves from
his lexicon all the associations which involve f,.
This set is called the association-set of h. Let
o E 0 be an object, a E A be an agent, and t a
time moment, then the association-set of o is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.973573">
Ao,a,t = {&lt; 0, W, U &gt;l&lt; 0, W, U &gt;E La,t} (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895285714286">
Each of the associations in this set suggests a
word w to use for identifying o with a score
0.0 &lt; U &lt; 1.0. The speaker orders the words
based on these scores. He then chooses the as-
sociation with the largest score and transmits
the word which is part of this association to the
hearer.
Next the hearer receives the word w trans-
mitted by the speaker. To handle stochasticity
the hearer not only considers the word itself a
set of candidate words W related to w. These
are all the words in the word-set of the hearer
Wh,t that are either equal to w or related with
some distance to w. The form scope parameter

<bodyText confidence="0.998747666666667">
f determines how far this distance can be. A
score is imposed over the members of the set of
candidate words:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.756694">
171&amp;quot; =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999621666666667">
Of is the form-focus factor. The higher this
factor, the sharper the hearer has been able to
identify the word produced by the speaker, and
therefore the less tolerant the hearer is going to
be to accept other candidates.
For each word wi in W, the hearer then
retrieves the association-set that contains it.
He constructs a score-matrix which contains
for each object a row and for each word-
form a column. The first column contains the
object-scores eo, the first row the form-scores
raw,. Each cell in the inner-matrix contains the
association-score for the relation between the
object and the word-form in the lexicon of the
hearer:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9522436">
wi w2 •••
mw, mw2 •••
01 eo, u&lt;01,1&gt;. u&lt;,1,w2&gt; •••

••• •••
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913242424243">
Obviously many cells in the matrix may be
empty (and then set to 0.0), because a certain
relation between an object and a word-form may
not be in the lexicon of the hearer. Note also
that there may be objects identified by lexicon
lookup which are not in the initial context C.
They are added to the matrix, but their object-
score is 0.0.
The final state of an inner matrix cell of the
score matrix is computed by taking a weighted
sum of (1) the object-score eo on its row, (2)
the word-form score mw on its column, and (3)
the association-score a&lt;0,w&gt; in the cell itself.
Weights indicate how strong the agent is will-
ing to rely on each source of information. One
object-word pair will have the best score and
the corresponding object is the topic fh chosen
by the hearer. The association in the lexicon of
this object-word pair is called the winning asso-
ciation. This choice integrates extra-linguistic
information (the object-score), word-form am-
biguity (the word-form-score), and the current
state of the hearer&apos;s lexicon (the association-
score).
The hearer then indicates to the speaker
what topic he identified. In real-world language
games, this could be through a subsequent ac-
tion or through another linguistic interaction.
When a decision could be made and fh = h
the game succeeds, otherwise it fails.
The following adaptations take place by the
speaker and the hearer based on the outcome of
the game.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.546351764705882">
1. The game succeeds This means that
speaker and hearer agree on the topic. To re-
enforce the lexicon, the speaker increments the
score u of the association that he preferred, and
hence used, with a fixed quantity 6. And decre-
ments the score of the n competing associations
with 6. 0.0 and 1.0 remain the lower and up-
perbound of u. An association is competing if it
associates the topic h with another word. The
hearer increments by 6 the score of the associ-
ation that came out with the best score in the
score-matrix, and decrements the n competing
associations with 6. An association is compet-
ing if it associates the wordform of the winning
association with another meaning.
2. The game fails There are several cases:
I. The Speaker does not know a word
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728166666667">
It could be that the speaker failed to re-
trieve from the lexicon an association covering
the topic. In that case, the game fails but the
speaker may create a new word-form w&apos; and as-
sociate this with the topic f, in his lexicon. This
happens with a word creation probability wa.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.691086">
2. The hearer does not know the word.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999624125">
In other words there is no association in the
lexicon of the hearer involving the word-form of
the winning association. In that case, the game
ends in failure but the hearer may extend his
lexicon with a word absorption probability wa.
He associates the word-form with the highest
form-score to the object with the highest object-
score.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.773467">
3. There is a mismatch between fh and h.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999190777777778">
In this case, both speaker and hearer have
to adapt their lexicons. The speaker and the
hearer decrement with 6 the association that
they used.
Figure 1 shows that the model achieves our
first objective. It displays the results of an ex-
periment where in phase 1 a group of 20 agents

ing 10 objects. Average game success reaches

20 agents and 10 meanings how a coherent set
of form-meaning pairs emerges (phase 1). In
a second phase, an in- and outflow of agents
(1 in/outflow per 200 games) is introduced, the
language stays the same and high success and
coherence is maintained.
a maximum and lexicon coherence (measured
as the average spread in the population of the
most dominant form-meaning pairs) is high (100
%) In the early stage there is important lexi-
con change as new form-meaning pairs need to
be generated from scratch by the agents. Lexi-
con change is defined to take place when a new
form-meaning pair overtakes another one in the
competition for the same meaning.
Phase 2 demonstrates that the lexicon is re-
silient to a flux in the population. An in- and
outflow of agents is introduced. A new agent
coming into the population has no knowledge at
all about the existing set of conventions. Suc-
cess and coherence therefore dip but quickly re-
gain as the new agents acquire the existing lex-
icon. High coherence is maintained as well as
high average game success. Between the begin-
ning of the flux and the end (after 30,000 lan-
guage games), the population has been renewed
5 times. Despite of this, the lexicon has not
changed. It is transmitted across generations
without change.

3 How a lexicon may innovate and
maintain variation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766230769231">
So, although this model explains the forma-
tion and transmission of a lexicon it does not
explain why a lexicon might change. Once
a winner-take-all situation emerges, competing
forms are completely suppressed and no new in-
novation arises. Our hypothesis is that innova-
tion and maintenance of variation is caused by
stochasticity in language use (Steels and Ka-
plan, 1998). Stochasticity naturally arises in
real world human communication and we very
much experienced this in robotic experiments as
well. Stochasticity is modeled by a number of
additional stochastic operators:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962361789473684">
1. Stochasticity in non-linguistic communica-
tion can be investigated by probabilistically
introducing a random error as to which ob-
ject is used as topic to calculate the object-
score. The probability is called the topic-
recognition-stochasticity T.
2. Stochasticity in the message transmission
process is caused by an error in produc-
tion by the speaker or an error in percep-
tion by the hearer. It is modeled with
a second stochastic operator F, the form-
stocha,sticity, which is the probability that
a character in the string constituting the
word form mutates.
3. Stochasticity in the lexicon is caused by er-
rors in memory lookup by the speaker or
the hearer. These errors are modeled us-
ing a third stochastic operator based on
a parameter A, the memory-stochasticity,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968759619047619">
which alters the scores of the associations
in the score matrix in a probabilistic fash-
ion.
The hearer has to take a broader scope into
account in order to deal with stochasticity. He
should also decrease the focus so that alterna-
tive candidates get a better chance to compete.
The broader scope and the weaker focus has also
the side effect that it will maintain variation in
the population. This is illustrated in figure 2. In
the first phase there is a high form-stochasticity
as well as a broad form-scope. Different forms
compete to express the same meaning and none
of them manages to become the winner. When
form-stochasticity is set to 0.0, the innovation
dies out but the broad scope maintains both
variations. One form (&amp;quot;ludo&amp;quot;) emerges as the
winner but another form (&amp;quot;mudo&amp;quot;) is also main-
tained in the population. There is no longer a
winner-take-all situation because agents toler-
ate the variation. We conclude the following:

of form-stochasticity and a broad form-scope.
The diagram shows all the forms competing for
the same meaning and the evolution of their
score. When F = 0.3 new word-forms are
occasionally introduced resulting in new word-
meaning associations. When F = 0.0 the in-
novation dies out although some words are still
able to maintain themselves due to the hearer&apos;s
broad focus.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.76833675">
1. Stochasticity introduces innovation in the
lexicon. There is no longer a clear winner-take-
all situation, whereby the lexicon stays in an
equilibrium state. Instead, there is a rich dy-

namics where new forms appear, new associa-
tions are established, and the domination pat-
tern of associations is challenged. The different
sources of stochasticity each innovate in their
own way: Topic-stochasticity introduces new
form-meaning associations for existing forms.
Form-stochasticity introduces new forms and
hence potentially new form-meaning associa-
tions. Memory-stochasticity shifts the balance
among the word-meaning associations compet-
ing for the expression of the same meaning.
2. Tolerance to stochasticity, due to a broad
scope (high a f) and a weak focus (low Of),
maintains variation. For example, suppose a
form &amp;quot;ludo&amp;quot; is transmitted by the speaker but
the hearer has only &amp;quot;mudo&amp;quot; in his lexicon. If
the form-focus factor is low and if both forms
refer in the respective agents to the same ob-
ject, their communication will be successful, be-
cause the word-score of &amp;quot;mudo&amp;quot; will not devi-
ate that much from &amp;quot;ludo&amp;quot;. Neither the hearer
nor the speaker will change their lexicons. Sim-
ilar effects arise when the agent broadens the
meaning scope and weakens its meaning focus
to deal with meaning stochasticity, caused by
error or uncertainty in the non-linguistic com-
munication.

4 How variation is amplified
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980295454546">
Although stochasticity and the agent&apos;s in-
creased tolerance to cope with stochasticity ex-
plain innovation and the maintenance of varia-
tion, they do not in themselves explain lexicon
change. Particularly when a language is already
established, the new form-meaning pairs do not
manage to overtake the dominating pair. To
get lexicon change we need an additional factor
that amplifies some of the variations present in
the population. Several such factors are proba-
bly at work. The most obvious one is a change
in the population. New agents arriving in the
community may first acquire a minor variant
which they then start to propagate further. Af-
ter a while this variant could become in turn
the dominant variant. We have conducted a se-
ries of experiments to test this hypothesis, with
remarkable results. Typically there is a period
of stability (even in the presence of uncertainty
and stochasticity) followed by a period of insta-
bility and strong competition, again followed by
a period of stasis. This phenomenon has been
observed for natural languages and is known in
biology as punctuated equilibria (Eldredge and
Gould, 1972).
The following are results of experiments fo-
cusing on form-stochasticity. Figure 3 shows
the average game success, lexicon coherence,
and lexicon change for an evolving population.
30,000 language games are shown. It starts
when the population develops a lexicon from
scratch (phase 1). Form-scope is constantly
kept at a&apos; = 5 in other words five forms are
considered similar to the world heard. Initially
there is no form-stochasticity. In phase 2 a flow
in the population is introduced with a new agent
every 100 games. We see that there is no lexicon
change. Success and Coherence is maintained at
high levels. Then form-stochasticity is increased
to sigma f = 0.05 in phase 3. Initially there is
still no lexicon change. But gradually the lan-
guage destabilises and rapid change is observed.
Interestingly enough average game success and
coherence are maintained at high levels. After

stochasticity, high tolerance (due to broad scope
and diffuse focus) and a flux in the popula-
tion. The lexicon is maintained even in the case
of population change (phase 2), but starts to
change when stochasticity is increased (phase
3)
a certain period a new phase of stability starts.
A companion figure (figure 4) focuses on
the competition between different forms for the
same meaning. In the initial stage there is
a winner-take-all situation (the word &amp;quot;bagi&amp;quot;).
When stochasticity is present, new forms start
to emerge but they are not yet competitive.
It is only when the flux in the population is
positive that we see one competitor &amp;quot;pagi&amp;quot; be-
coming strong enough to eventually overtake
&amp;quot;bagi&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;bagi&amp;quot; resulted from a misunderstand-
ing of &amp;quot;pagi&amp;quot;. There is a lot of instability as
other words also enter into competition, giv-
ing successive dominance of &amp;quot;kagi&amp;quot;, then &amp;quot;kugi&amp;quot;
and then &amp;quot;kugo&amp;quot;. A winner-take-all situation
arises with &amp;quot;kugo&amp;quot; and therefore a new period
of stability sets in. Similar results can be seen
for stochasticity in non-linguistic communica-
tion and in the lexicon.

<bodyText confidence="0.988553655172414">
The paper has presented a theory that explains
spontaneous lexicon change based on internal
factors. The theory postulates that (1) coher-
ence in language is due to self-organisation, i.e.
the presence of a positive feedback loop between
the choice for using a form-meaning pair and
the success in using it, (2) innovation is due

between different forms for the same meaning.
We clearly see first a rapid winner-take-all situa-
tion with the word &amp;quot;bagi&amp;quot;, then the rise of com-
petitors until one (&amp;quot;pagi&amp;quot;) overtakes the others.
A period of instability follows after which a new
dominant winner (&amp;quot;kugo&amp;quot;) emerges.
to stochasticity, i.e. errors in form transmis-
sion, non-linguistic communication, or memory
access, (3) maintenance of variation is due to
the tolerance agents need to exhibit in order to
cope with stochasticity, namely the broadening
of scope and the weakening of focus, and finally
(4) amplification of variation happens due to
change in the population. Only when all four
factors are present will effective change be ob-
served.
These hypotheses have been tested using a
formal model of language use in a dynamically
evolving population. The model has been im-
plemented and subjected to extensive computa-
tional simulations, validating the hypotheses.

Spontane Veranderingen van het Lexicon
Dit artikel argumenteert dat taalevolutie kan
verklaard worden aan de hand van de stochas-
ticiteit die zich voordoet bij taalgebruik in real-
istische omstandigheden. Deze hypothese wordt
aangetoond door taalgebruik te modelleren via
taalspelen in een evoluerende populatie van
agenten. Wij tonen aan dat de artificiele talen
die de agenten spontaan ontwikkelen via zelf-
organisatie, niet evolueren, zelfs als de popu-
latie verandert. Dan introduceren we stochas-
ticiteit in taalgebruik en tonen aan dat dit leidt
tot innovatie (nieuwe vormen en nieuwe vorm-
betekenis associaties) en tot het behoud van
variatie in de populatie. Sommige van deze vari-
aties worden dominant, vooral als de populatie
verandert. Op die manier kunnen we de lexicale
veranderingen verklaren.
Changements spontanes de lexique
Ce document defend l&apos;idee que les change-
ments linguistiques peuvent etre expliques par
la stochasticite observees dans l&apos;utilisation effec-
tive du langage naturel. Nous soutenons cette
these en utilisant un modele informatique min-
imal des usages linguistiques sous la forme de
jeux de langage dans une population d&apos;agents
en evolution. Nous montrons que les langues
artificielles que les agents developpent spon-
&apos; tanement en s&apos;auto-organisant, n&apos;evoluent pas
meme si la population se modifie. Nous in-
troduisons ensuite, dans l&apos;utilisation du Ian-
gage, de la stochasticite et montrons comment
un niveau constant d&apos;innovation apparait (nou-
velles formes, nouveaux sens, nouvelles associa-
tions entre formes et sens) et comment des vari-
ations peuvent se maintenir dans la population.
Certaines de ces variations prennent la place de
conventions lexicales existantes, en particulier
dans le cas de populations qui evoluent, ce qui
permet d&apos;expliquer les changements du lexique.

<abstract confidence="0.999367555555556">The paper argues that language change can be explained through the stochasticity observed in real-world natural language use. This thesis is demonstrated by modeling language use through language games played in an evolving population of agents. We show that the artificial languages which the agents spontaneously develop based on self-organisation, do not evolve even if the population is changing. Then we introduce stochasticity in language use and show that this leads to a constant innovation (new forms and new form-meaning associations) and a maintenance of variation in the population, if the agents are tolerant to variation. Some of these variations overtake existing linguistic k conventions, particularly in changing populations, thus explaining lexicon change.</abstract>

This internal, apparently nonfunctional evolution of language has been discussed widely in the linguistic literature, leading some linguists to strongly reject the possibility of evolutionary explanations of language (Chomsky, 1990). In biological systems, evolution takes place because [1] a population shows natural variation, and [2] the distribution of traits in the population changes under the influence of selection pressures present in the environment. Note that biological variation is also non-functional. Natural selection acts post factum as a selecting agent, pushing the population in certain directions, but the novelty is created independently of a particular goal by stochastic forces operating during genetic transmission and development.

New agents arriving in the community may first acquire a minor variant which they then start to propagate further. After a while this variant could become in turn the dominant variant. We have conducted a series of experiments to test this hypothesis, with remarkable results. Typically there is a period of stability (even in the presence of uncertainty and stochasticity) followed by a period of instability and strong competition, again followed by a period of stasis. This phenomenon has been observed for natural languages and is known in biology as punctuated equilibria (Eldredge and Gould, 1972). The following are results of experiments focusing on form-stochasticity. Figure 3 shows the average game success, lexicon coherence, and lexicon change for an evolving population. 30,000 language games are shown. It starts when the population develops a lexicon from scratch (phase 1). Form-scope is constantly kept at a&apos; = 5 in other words five forms are considered similar to the world heard. Initially there is no form-stochasticity. In phase 2 a flow in the population is introduced with a new agent every 100 games. We see that there is no lexicon change.

This is partly due to external factors such as language contact between different populations or the need to express new meanings or support new modes of interaction with language.

For example, many sound changes, like from /b/ to /p/, /d/ to /t/, and /g/ to /k/, which took place in the evolution from proto-Indo-European to Modern Germanic languages, do not have an external motivation. Neither do many shifts in the expression of meanings. For example, the expression of future tense in English has shifted from &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;, even though &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot; was perfectly suited and &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; meant something else (namely &amp;quot;wanting to&amp;quot;).

Despite of this, the lexicon has not changed. It is transmitted across generations without change. 3 How a lexicon may innovate and maintain variation So, although this model explains the formation and transmission of a lexicon it does not explain why a lexicon might change. Once a winner-take-all situation emerges, competing forms are completely suppressed and no new innovation arises. Our hypothesis is that innovation and maintenance of variation is caused by stochasticity in language use (Steels and Kaplan, 1998). Stochasticity naturally arises in real world human communication and we very much experienced this in robotic experiments as well. Stochasticity is modeled by a number of additional stochastic operators: 1. Stochasticity in non-linguistic communication can be investigated by probabilistically introducing a random error as to which object is used as topic to calculate the objectscore. The probability is called the topicrecognition-stochasticity T. 2. Stochasticity in the message transmission process is caused by an error in production by the speaker or an error in perception by the hearer. It</context>

The naming game focuses on associating form and meaning. Obviously in human natural languages both form and meaning are non-atomic entities with complex internal structure, but the results reported here do not depend on this internal complexity. We assume a set of agents A where each agent a E A has contact with a set of objects 0 = {oo, on}. The set of objects constitutes the environment of the agents. A word is a </context>
