Semitic Languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999646">
The Semitic family includes many languages and dialects spoken by a large number of native speakers
(around 300 Million). However, Semitic languages are still understudied. The most prominent members
of this family are Arabic and its dialects, Hebrew, Amharic, Aramaic, Maltese and Syriac. Beyond their
shared ancestry which is apparent through pervasive cognate sharing, a common characteristic of these
languages is the rich and productive pattern-based morphology and similar syntactic constructions.

Previous Efforts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711714285714">
An increasing body of computational linguistics work is starting to appear for both Arabic and Hebrew.
Arabic alone, as the largest member of the Semitic family, has been receiving a lot of attention lately
in terms of dedicated workshops and conferences. These include, but are not limited to, the workshop
on Arabic Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2002), a special session on Arabic processing
in Traitement Automatique du Langage Naturel (TALN 2004), the Workshop on Computational
Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages (COLING 2004), and the NEMLAR Arabic Language
Resources and Tools Conference in Cairo, Egypt (2004). This phenomenon has been coupled with a
relative surge in resources for Arabic due to concerted efforts by the LDC and ELDA/ELRA. However,
there is an apparent lag in the development of resources and tools for other Semitic languages. Often,
work on individual Semitic languages, unfortunately, still tends to be done with limited awareness of
ongoing research in other Semitic languages. Within the last four years, only three workshops addressed
Semitic languages: an ACL 2002 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages and
an MT Summit IX Workshop on Machine Translation for Semitic Languages in 2003, and the EAMT
2004, held in Malta, had a special session on Semitic languages.

Current Workshop

Welcome to the ACL 2005 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages. This
workshop is a sequel to the ACL 2002 workshop and shares its goals of: (i) heightening awareness
amongst Semitic-language researchers of shared breakthroughs and challenges, (ii) highlighting issues
common to all Semitic languages as much as possible, (iii) encouraging the potential for developing
coordinated approaches; and (iv) in addition, leveraging resource and tool creation for less prominent
members of the Semitic language family.
We received 21 submissions, we accepted 12. The accepted papers cover several languages: Modern
Standard Arabic, Dialectal Arabic, Hebrew, and Amharic. They cover a span of topics in computational
linguistics, from morphological analysis and disambiguation and diacritization to information retrieval
and document classification using both symbolic and statistical approaches.
We hope you enjoy reading this volume as much as we did.
