Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934517241379">
Adverse reactions to drugs are among the
most common causes of death in industri-
alized nations. Expensive clinical trials are
not sufficient to uncover all of the adverse
reactions a drug may cause, necessitating
systems for post-marketing surveillance,
or pharmacovigilance. These systems
have typically relied on voluntary report-
ing by health care professionals. However,
self-reported patient data has become an
increasingly important resource, with ef-
forts such as MedWatch from the FDA al-
lowing reports directly from the consumer.
In this paper, we propose mining the re-
lationships between drugs and adverse re-
actions as reported by the patients them-
selves in user comments to health-related
websites. We evaluate our system on a
manually annotated set of user comments,
with promising performance. We also re-
port encouraging correlations between the
frequency of adverse drug reactions found
by our system in unlabeled data and the
frequency of documented adverse drug re-
actions. We conclude that user comments
pose a significant natural language pro-
cessing challenge, but do contain useful
extractable information which merits fur-
ther exploration.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970214285714">
It is estimated that approximately 2 million pa-
tients in the United States are affected each year by
severe adverse drug reactions, resulting in roughly
100,000 fatalities. This makes adverse drug re-
actions the fourth leading cause of death in the
U.S, following cancer and heart diseases (Giaco-
mini et al., 2007). It is estimated that $136 bil-
lion is spent annually on treating adverse drug re-
actions in the U.S., and other nations face simi-
lar difficulties (van Der Hooft et al., 2006; Leone
et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the frequency of ad-
verse drug reactions is often under-estimated due
to a reliance on voluntary reporting (Bates et al.,
2003; van Der Hooft et al., 2006).
While severe adverse reactions have received
significant attention, less attention has been di-
rected to the indirect costs of more common
adverse reactions such as nausea and dizziness,
which may still be severe enough to motivate the
patient to stop taking the drug. The literature
shows, however, that non-compliance is a major
cause of the apparent failure of drug treatments,
and the resulting economic costs are estimated to
be quite significant (Urquhart, 1999; Hughes et al.,
2001). Thus, detecting and characterizing adverse
drug reactions of all levels of severity is critically
important, particularly in an era where the demand
for personalized health care is high.

1.1 Definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999652333333333">
An adverse drug reaction is generally defined as
an unintended, harmful reaction suspected to be
caused by a drug taken under normal conditions
(World Health Organization, 1966; Lee, 2006).
This definition is sufficiently broad to include such
conditions as allergic reactions, drug tolerance,
addiction or aggravation of the original condition.
A reaction is considered severe if it “results in
death, requires hospital admission or prolonga-
tion..., results in persistent or significant disabil-
ity/incapacity, or is life-threatening,” or if it causes
a congenital abnormality (Lee, 2006).

1.2 Pharmacovigilance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936175">
The main sources of adverse drug reaction in-
formation are clinical trials and post-marketing
surveillance instruments made available by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the
United States, and similar governmental agencies
worldwide. The purpose of a clinical trial, how-
ever, is only to determine whether a product is
effective and to detect common serious adverse
events. Clinical trials, by their nature and pur-
pose, are focused on a limited number of par-
ticipants selected by inclusion/exclusion criteria
reflecting specific subject characteristics (demo-
graphic, medical condition and diagnosis, age).
Thus, major uncertainties about the safety of the
drug remain when the drug is made available to
a wider population over longer periods of time,
in patients with co-morbidities and in conjunction
with other medications or when taken for off-label
uses not previously evaluated.
Recently, the regulatory bodies of both the U.S.
and the U.K. have begun programs for patient re-
porting of adverse drug reactions. Studies have
shown that patient reporting is of similar qual-
ity to that of health professionals, and there is
some evidence that patients are more likely to
self-report adverse drug reactions when they be-
lieve the health professionals caring for them have
not paid sufficient attention to an adverse reaction
(Blenkinsopp et al., 2007). In general, however,
the FDA advocates reporting only serious events
through MedWatch.
Self-reported patient information captures a
valuable perspective that might not be captured in
a doctor’s office, clinical trial, or even in the most
sophisticated surveillance software. For this rea-
son, the International Society of Drug Bulletins
asserted in 2005 that “patient reporting systems
should periodically sample the scattered drug ex-
periences patients reported on the internet.”

1.3 Social Networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872791666667">
Social networks focusing on health related topics
have seen rapid growth in recent years. Users in
an online community often share a wide variety
of personal medical experiences. These interac-
tions can take many forms, including blogs, mi-
croblogs and question/answer discussion forums.
For many reasons, patients often share health ex-
periences with each other rather than in a clini-
cal research study or with their physician (Davi-
son et al., 2000). Such social networks bridge
the geographical gap between people, allowing
them to connect with patients who share similar
conditions–something that might not be possible
in the real world.
In this paper we propose and evaluate automat-
ically extracting relationships between drugs and
adverse reactions in user posts to health-related
social network websites. We anticipate this tech-
nique will provide valuable additional confirma-
tion of suspected associations between drugs and
adverse reactions. Moreover, it is possible this
technique may eventually provide the ability to
detect novel associations earlier than with current
methods.

In the work closest in purpose to this study, two
reviewers manually analyzed 1,374 emails to the
BBC and 862 messages on a discussion forum re-
garding a link between the drug paroxetine and
several adverse reactions including withdrawal
symptoms and suicide (Medawara et al., 2002).
The authors concluded that the user reports con-
tained clear evidence of linkages that the voluntary
reporting system then in place had not detected.
Not much work has been done to automatically
extract adverse reactions from text, other than the
SIDER side effect resource, which was created by
mining drug insert literature (Kuhn et al., 2010).
There is, however, significant literature support for
mining more general concepts, such as diseases.
MetaMap is a primarily lexical system for map-
ping concepts in biomedical text to concepts in
the UMLS Metathesaurus (Aronson, 2001). The
ConText system categorizes findings in clinical
records as being negated, hypothetical, or histor-
ical (Harkema et al., 2009).
Most of the work on finding diseases concerns
either biomedical text or clinical records. A no-
table exception is the BioCaster system, which de-
tects infectious disease outbreaks by mining news
reports posted to the web (Collier et al., 2008).
Health social networks have become a popular
way for patients to share their health related expe-
riences. A considerable amount of research has
been devoted to this area (Moturu et al., 2008),
but most of this work has focused on the study of
social interactions and quality evaluation instead
of text mining. Automated information extrac-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843272727273">
We used the DailyStrength1 health-related social
network as the source of user comments in this
study. DailyStrength allows users to create pro-
files, maintain friends and join various disease-
related support groups. It serves as a resource for
patients to connect with others who have similar
conditions, many of whom are friends solely on-
line. As of 2007, DailyStrength had an average
of 14,000 daily visitors, each spending 82 minutes
on the site and viewing approximately 145 pages
(comScore Media Metrix Canada, 2007).

3.1 Data Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999934">
To efficiently gather user comments about spe-
cific drugs from the DailyStrength site, we im-
plemented a highly parallelized automatic web
crawler. All data was scraped from the raw
HTML using regular expressions since the site has
no open API. Users indicate a specific treatment
when posting comments to DailyStrength, how-
ever we filter treatments which are not drugs. For
each user comment we extracted the user ID, dis-
ease name, drug name, and comment text. While
more information about each user is available at
the site (gender, age, self-declared location, and
length of membership at the site), we limited our
data usage to just the comment data. The Dai-
lyStrength Privacy Policy states that comments
made by users will be publicly available. All
data was gathered in accordance with the Dai-
lyStrength Terms of Service, and to respect fair
use the data will not be made publicly available
without permission from the site.

3.2 Preparing the Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999918">
To enable finding adverse reactions in the user
comments, we created a lexicon by combining
terms and concepts from four resources.
The UMLS Metathesaurus is a resource con-
taining many individual biomedical vocabularies
(National Library of Medicine, 2008). We utilized
a subset limited to the COSTART vocabulary cre-
ated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
post-marketing surveillance of adverse drug reac-
tions, which contains 3,787 concepts.

<footnote confidence="0.963369">

<bodyText confidence="0.999524857142857">
The SIDER side effect resource contains 888
drugs linked with 1,450 adverse reaction terms
extracted from pharmaceutical insert literature
(Kuhn et al., 2010). We used the raw term found
in the literature and the associated UMLS concept
identifier (CUI).
The Canada Drug Adverse Reaction Database,
or MedEffect2, contains associations between
10,192 drugs and 3,279 adverse reactions, which
we used to create a list of adverse reaction terms.
We found many adverse reaction terms with very
similar meanings, for example “appetite exagger-
ated,” and “appetite increased,” which we grouped
together manually.
We also included a small set of colloquial
phrases we located manually in a subset of the
DailyStrength comments and mapped to UMLS
CUIs. This list is available3, and includes the
terms “throw up,” meaning vomit, “gain pounds,”
meaning weight gain, and “zonked out,” meaning
somnolence.
We considered all terms which are associated
with the same UMLS concept identifier (CUI) as
synonymous and grouped them into a single con-
cept. We also merged all concepts containing a
term in common into a single unified concept. Our
lexicon contains 4,201 unified concepts, each con-
taining between one and about 200 terms.

4 Annotation

<bodyText confidence="0.999971722222222">
We annotated comments relating to the following
4 drugs: carbamazepine, olanzapine, trazodone,
and ziprasidone. These drugs were chosen be-
cause they are known to cause adverse reactions
and we could verify our results with close collabo-
rators. We retained but did not annotate comments
for the drugs aspirin and ciprofloxacin; these com-
ments are used during evaluation. Our data con-
tains a total of 6,890 comment records. User com-
ments were selected for annotation randomly and
were independently annotated by two annotators.
Annotator 1 has a BS in biology, 10 years nurs-
ing experience in the behavioral unit of a long term
care facility, and has dispensed all of the drugs an-
notated. Annotator 2 has a BS and an MS in neuro-
science, and has work experience in data manage-
ment for pharmaceutical-related clinical research
and post-marketing drug surveillance.

4.1 Concepts Annotated
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995555555556">
Each comment was annotated for mentions of ad-
verse effects, beneficial effects, indications and
other terms, as defined in table 1. Each annota-
tion included the span of the mention and the name
of the concept found, using entries from the lexi-
con described in section 3.2. Each annotation also
indicates whether it refers to an adverse effect, a
beneficial effect, an indication or an other term,
which we shall call its characterization.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993062">
4.2 Annotation Practices
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999232">
There are four aspects which require careful con-
sideration when characterizing mentions. First,
the stated concept may or may not be actually
experienced by the patient; mentions of concepts
not experienced by the patient were categorized as
other. Second, the user may state that the con-
cept is the reason for taking the drug. If so, the
mention was categorized as an indication. Third,
the concept may be an effect caused by the drug.
In this case, the mention is categorized as either
an adverse effect or a beneficial effect based on
whether the user considers the effect a positive
one. This requires some judgment regarding what
people normally view as positive – while sleepi-
ness is normally an adverse effect, someone suf-
fering from insomnia would consider it a benefi-
cial effect, regardless of whether insomnia is the
primary reason for taking the drug. Mentions of
concepts which were experienced by the patient
but neither an effect of the drug nor the reason for
taking it were also categorized as other. Concepts
were characterized as an adverse effect unless the
context indicated otherwise.
Comments not containing a mention or that only
indicated the presence of an adverse effect (“Gave
me weird side effects”) were discarded. If more
than one mention occurred in a comment, then
each mention was annotated separately.
Some comments clearly mentioned an adverse
reaction, but the reaction itself was ambiguous.
For example, in the comment “It did the job when
I was really low. However, I BALLOONED on
it,” the annotator could infer “BALLOONED” to
mean either weight gain or edema. A frequent ex-
ample is colloquial terms such as “zombie,” which
could be interpreted as a physiological effect (e.g.
fatigue) or a cognitive effect (e.g. mental dull-
ness). In such cases, each mention was annotated
by using both the context of the mention and an-
notator’s knowledge of the effects of the drug.
Spans were annotated by choosing the mini-
mum span of characters from the comment that
would maintain the meaning of the term. Lo-
cating the mention boundaries was straightfor-
ward in many cases, even when descriptive words
were in the middle of the term (“It works bet-
ter than the other meds ive taken but I am
gaining some weight”). However some com-
ments were not as simple (“it works but the
pounds are packing on”).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998663">
4.3 Corpus Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986388888889">
A total of 3,600 comments were annotated, a sam-
ple of which can be seen in table 2. We reserved
450 comments for system development. The an-
notators found 1,260 adverse effects, 391 indica-
tions, 157 beneficial effects and 78 other, for a to-
tal of 1,886 annotations.
We measured the agreement between annotators
by calculating both kappa (n) (Cohen, 1960) and
inter-annotator agreement (IAA). For n, we con-
sidered agreement to mean that the concept terms
were in the same unified concept from the lexicon
and the characterization of the mentions matched,
since there is no standard method for calculating
n which includes the span. For IAA, we added
the constraint that the annotation spans must over-
lap, since discussions of IAA typically include the
span. Using these definitions, n was calculated to
be 85.6% and IAA to be 85.3%4.

comments, we implemented a primarily lexical

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991804">
5.1 Methods Used
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880136363636">
Each user comment was split into sentences using
the Java sentence breaker, tokenized by splitting at
whitespace and punctuation, and tagged for part-
of-speech using the Hepple tagger (Hepple, 2000).
Stop-words were removed from both user com-
ments and lexical terms5. Tokens were stemmed
using the Snowball implementation of the Porter2
stemer6.
m
Terms from the lexicon were found in the user
comments by comparing a sliding window of to-
kens from the comment to each token in the lexical
term. The size of the window is configurable and
set to 5 for this study since that is the number of
tokens in the longest term found by the annotators.
Using a sliding window allows the tokens to be in
different orders and for there to be irrelevant to-
kens between the relevant ones, as in weight gain
and “gained a lot of weight.”
Since user comments contain many spelling er-
rors, we used the Jaro-Winkler measurement of
string similarity to compare the individual tokens
(Winkler, 1999). We scored the similarity between
the window of tokens in the user comment and the
tokens in the lexical term by pairing them as an
assignment problem (Burkard et al., 2009). We
then summed the similarities of the individual to-
kens and normalized the result by the number of
tokens in the lexical term. This score is calculated
for both the original tokens and the stemmed to-
kens in the window, and the final score is taken to
be the higher of the two scores. The lexical term is
considered to be present in a user comment if the
final score is greater than a configurable threshold.
We noted that most mentions could be cate-
gorized by using the closest verb to the left of
the mention, as in “taking for seizures.” As this
study focuses on adverse effects, we implemented
a filtering method to remove indications, benefi-
cial effects, and other mentions on a short list of
verbs we found to indicate them. Verbs on this
list include “helps,” “works,” and “prescribe” all
of which generally denote indications. The com-
plete list is available7.

verse effects. We used a strict definition of true
positive, requiring the system to label the mention
with a term from the same unified concept as the
annotators. The results of this study are 78.3%
precision and 69.9% recall, for an f-measure of
73.9%.
Since the purpose of this study is to determine
if mining user comments is a valid way to find ad-
verse reactions, we ran our system on all avail-
able comments and compared the frequencies of
adverse reactions found against their documented
incidence. We calculated the frequency that each
adverse effect was found in the user comments
for each of the drugs studied in this experiment.
We then determined the most commonly found ad-
verse reactions for each drug and compared them
against the most common documented adverse re-
actions for the drug. Since the four drugs we chose
for annotation all act primarily on the central ner-
vous system, we added aspirin and ciprofloxacin
for this study. The results of this evaluation con-
tain encouraging correlations that are summarized
in table 3.

6.1 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988576923077">
We performed an analysis to determine the pri-
mary sources of error for our extraction system.
We randomly selected 100 comments and deter-
mined the reason for the 24 false positives (FPs)
and 29 false negatives (FNs) found.
The largest source of error (17% of FPs and
55% of FNs) was the use of novel adverse re-
action phrases (“liver problem”) and descriptions
(“burn like a lobster”). This problem is due in part
to idiomatic expressions, which may be handled
by creating and using a specialist lexicon. This
problem might also be partially relieved by the ap-
propriate use of semantic analysis. However, this
source of error is also caused by the users delib-
erately employing a high degree of linguistic cre-
ativity (“TURNED ME INTO THE SPAWN OF
SATAN!!!”) which may require deep background
knowledge to correctly recognize.
The next largest source of error was poor ap-
proximate string matching (46% of FPs and 17%
of FNs). While users frequently misspelled words,
making lexical analysis difficult, the approximate
string matching technique used also introduced
many FPs. We note that spelling unfamiliar med-
ical terminology is particularly difficult for users.
Correcting this important source of error will re-
quire improved modeling of the spelling errors
made by users.
Ambiguous terms accounted for 8% of the FPs
and 7% of the FNs. While this is frequently
a problem with colloquial phrases (“brain fog”
could refer to mental dullness or somnolence),
there are some terms which are ambiguous on their
own (“numb” may refer to loss of sensation or
emotional indifference). These errors can be cor-
rected by improving the analysis of the context
surrounding each mention.
Surprisingly, miscategorizations only ac-
counted for 4% of the FPs. This small percentage
seems to indicate that the simple filtering tech-
nique employed is reasonably effective. However
this source of error can be seen more prominently
in the frequency analysis, as seen in table 3. For
example, one of the most frequent effects found in
comments about trazodone was insomnia, which
is one of its most common off-label uses. Other
examples included depression with olanzapine,
mania with ziprasidone, and stroke with aspirin.
We note that since conditions not being experi-
enced by the patient are always categorized as
other, our techniques should profit somewhat
from an extension to handle negation.

6.2 Analysis of Documented vs. Found
Adverse Reactions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
The experiment comparing the documented inci-
dence of adverse reactions to the frequency they
are found contained some interesting correlations
and differences. We begin by noting that the ad-
verse reaction found most frequently for all 6 of
the drugs corresponded to a documented adverse
reaction. There were also similarities in the less
common reactions, such as diabetes with olanzap-
ine and bleeding with aspirin. In addition, many of
the adverse reactions found corresponded to docu-
mented, but less common, reactions to the drug.
Examples of this included edema with olanzap-
ine, nightmares with trazodone, weight gain with
ziprasidone, tinnitus with aspirin, and yeast infec-
tion with ciprofloxacin.
One interesting difference is the relative fre-
quency of “hangover” in the comments for ziprasi-

Users frequently commented on weight gain
and fatigue while ignoring other reactions such as
increased cholesterol. While this may be because
users are more conscious of issues they can di-
rectly observe, this hypothesis would not explain
why other directly observable reactions such as
nausea and constipation are not always reported.
Determining the general trends in the differences

6.3 Limitations

<bodyText confidence="0.99999625">
The present study has some limitations. We
did not analyze the demographics of the users
whose comments we mined, though it is likely
that they are predominantly from North America
and English-speaking. In future work we intend
to expand the range of users and compare their
demographics against clinical studies of adverse
reactions. Also, the drugs we annotated oper-
ate primarily on the central nervous system and
therefore have different adverse reaction profiles
than would other drugs with substantially different
mechanisms. While the inclusion of aspirin and
ciprofloxacin does provide some evidence these
techniques are more generally applicable, we also
intend to expand the range of drugs studied in fu-
ture work.

6.4 Opportunities for Further Study
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996909090909">
In addition to our current classification for ad-
verse reactions, there are additional dimensions
along which each user comment could be studied.
For example, many comments describe the degree
of the adverse reaction, which can be straight-
forward (“extremely”) or more creative (“like a
pig”). Also, many users explicitly state whether
they are still taking the drug, typically indicating
whether their physician took them off or whether
they took themselves off (non-compliance), and
whether adverse reactions were the reason. User

comments can also be categorized as medically
non-descriptive (“I took one tablet and could’nt
get out of bed for days and felt like I got hit
by a truck”), somewhat medically descriptive
(“My kidneys were not functioning properly”),
or medically sound (“I ended up with severe leg
swelling”). Comments also typically indicate
whether the user is the patient or a caretaker by be-
ing phrased in either the first person or third person
narrative. Finally, users also frequently describe
whether they thought the benefits of the drug out-
weighed the adverse effects. We believe these ad-
ditional dimensions represent a fertile area for fur-
ther research.

7 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999854538461539">
In summary, we have shown that user comments
to health related social networks do contain ex-
tractable information relevant to pharmacovigi-
lance. We believe this approach should be eval-
uated for the ability to detect novel relationships
between drugs and adverse reactions.
In addition to the improvements discussed in
section 6, we plan in future work to increase the
scale of the study (additional drugs, additional
data sources, more user comments), improve the
characterization of reactions using rule-based pat-
terns, and evaluate the improved system with re-
spect to all characterizations.

<abstract confidence="0.9974714">Adverse reactions to drugs are among the most common causes of death in industrialized nations. Expensive clinical trials are not sufficient to uncover all of the adverse reactions a drug may cause, necessitating systems for post-marketing surveillance, or pharmacovigilance. These systems have typically relied on voluntary reporting by health care professionals. However, self-reported patient data has become an increasingly important resource, with efforts such as MedWatch from the FDA allowing reports directly from the consumer. In this paper, we propose mining the relationships between drugs and adverse reactions as reported by the patients themselves in user comments to health-related websites. We evaluate our system on a manually annotated set of user comments, with promising performance. We also report encouraging correlations between the frequency of adverse drug reactions found by our system in unlabeled data and the frequency of documented adverse drug reactions. We conclude that user comments pose a significant natural language processing challenge, but do contain useful extractable information which merits further exploration.</abstract>

The authors concluded that the user reports contained clear evidence of linkages that the voluntary reporting system then in place had not detected. Not much work has been done to automatically extract adverse reactions from text, other than the SIDER side effect resource, which was created by mining drug insert literature (Kuhn et al., 2010). There is, however, significant literature support for mining more general concepts, such as diseases. MetaMap is a primarily lexical system for mapping concepts in biomedical text to concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus (Aronson, 2001). The ConText system categorizes findings in clinical records as being negated, hypothetical, or historical (Harkema et al., 2009). Most of the work on finding diseases concerns either biomedical text or clinical records. A notable exception is the BioCaster system, which detects infectious disease outbreaks by mining news reports posted to the web (Collier et al., 2008).

This makes adverse drug reactions the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S, following cancer and heart diseases (Giacomini et al., 2007). It is estimated that $136 billion is spent annually on treating adverse drug reactions in the U.S., and other nations face similar difficulties (van Der Hooft et al., 2006; Leone et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the frequency of adverse drug reactions is often under-estimated due to a reliance on voluntary reporting (Bates et al., 2003; van Der Hooft et al., 2006). While severe adverse reactions have received significant attention, less attention has been directed to the indirect costs of more common adverse reactions such as nausea and dizziness, which may still be severe enough to motivate the patient to stop taking the drug. The literature shows, however, that non-compliance is a major cause of the apparent failure of drug treatments, and the resulting economic costs are estimated to be quite significant (Urquhart, 1999; Hughes et al., 2001).

Recently, the regulatory bodies of both the U.S. and the U.K. have begun programs for patient reporting of adverse drug reactions. Studies have shown that patient reporting is of similar quality to that of health professionals, and there is some evidence that patients are more likely to self-report adverse drug reactions when they believe the health professionals caring for them have not paid sufficient attention to an adverse reaction (Blenkinsopp et al., 2007). In general, however, the FDA advocates reporting only serious events through MedWatch. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that might not be captured in a doctor’s office, clinical trial, or even in the most sophisticated surveillance software. For this reason, the International Society of Drug Bulletins asserted in 2005 that “patient reporting systems should periodically sample the scattered drug experiences patients reported on the internet.” 1.3 Social Networks Social networks focusing on health related topics have seen rapid growth in recent years.

We reserved 450 comments for system development. The annotators found 1,260 adverse effects, 391 indications, 157 beneficial effects and 78 other, for a total of 1,886 annotations. We measured the agreement between annotators by calculating both kappa (n) (Cohen, 1960) and inter-annotator agreement (IAA). For n, we considered agreement to mean that the concept terms were in the same unified concept from the lexicon and the characterization of the mentions matched, since there is no standard method for calculating n which includes the span. For IAA, we added the constraint that the annotation spans must overlap, since discussions of IAA typically include the span. Using these definitions, n was calculated to be 85.6% and IAA to be 85.3%4. 5 Text Mining Since the drug name is specified by the user when the comment is submitted to DailyStrength, no ex4r,&gt;IAA h</context>

Users in an online community often share a wide variety of personal medical experiences. These interactions can take many forms, including blogs, microblogs and question/answer discussion forums. For many reasons, patients often share health experiences with each other rather than in a clinical research study or with their physician (Davison et al., 2000). Such social networks bridge the geographical gap between people, allowing them to connect with patients who share similar conditions–something that might not be possible in the real world. In this paper we propose and evaluate automatically extracting relationships between drugs and adverse reactions in user posts to health-related social network websites.

To extract the adverse drug reactions from the user comments, we implemented a primarily lexical method, utilizing the lexicon discussed in section 3.2. 5.1 Methods Used Each user comment was split into sentences using the Java sentence breaker, tokenized by splitting at whitespace and punctuation, and tagged for partof-speech using the Hepple tagger (Hepple, 2000). Stop-words were removed from both user comments and lexical terms5. Tokens were stemmed using the Snowball implementation of the Porter2 stemer6. m Terms from the lexicon were found in the user comments by comparing a sliding window of tokens from the comment to each token in the lexical term. The size of the window is configurable and set to 5 for this study since that is the number of tokens in the longest term found by the annotators. Using a sliding window allows the tokens to be in different orders and for there to be irrelevant tokens between the relevant ones, as in weight gain and “g</context>

While severe adverse reactions have received significant attention, less attention has been directed to the indirect costs of more common adverse reactions such as nausea and dizziness, which may still be severe enough to motivate the patient to stop taking the drug. The literature shows, however, that non-compliance is a major cause of the apparent failure of drug treatments, and the resulting economic costs are estimated to be quite significant (Urquhart, 1999; Hughes et al., 2001). Thus, detecting and characterizing adverse drug reactions of all levels of severity is critically important, particularly in an era where the demand for personalized health care is high. 1.1 Definitions An adverse drug reaction is generally defined as an unintended, harmful reaction suspected to be caused by a drug taken under normal conditions (World Health Organization, 1966; Lee, 2006). This definition is sufficiently broad to include such conditions as allergic reactions, drug tolerance, addiction or aggravation of the original condition.

The UMLS Metathesaurus is a resource containing many individual biomedical vocabularies (National Library of Medicine, 2008).

The Canada Drug Adverse Reaction Database, or MedEffect2, contains associations between 10,192 drugs and 3,279 adverse reactions, which we used to create a list of adverse reaction terms. We found many adverse reaction terms with very similar meanings, for example “appetite exaggerated,” and “appetite increased,” which we grouped together manually.

This makes adverse drug reactions the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S, following cancer and heart diseases (Giacomini et al., 2007). It is estimated that $136 billion is spent annually on treating adverse drug reactions in the U.S., and other nations face similar difficulties (van Der Hooft et al., 2006; Leone et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the frequency of adverse drug reactions is often under-estimated due to a reliance on voluntary reporting (Bates et al., 2003; van Der Hooft et al., 2006). While severe adverse reactions have received significant attention, less attention has been directed to the indirect costs of more common adverse reactions such as nausea and dizziness, which may still be severe enough to motivate the patient to stop taking the drug.
