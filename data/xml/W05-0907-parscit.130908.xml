This papers reports the application of
the QARLA evaluation framework to the
DUC 2004 testbed (tasks 2 and 5). Our
experiment addresses two issues: how
well QARLA evaluation measures corre-
late with human judgements, and what ad-
ditional insights can be provided by the
QARLA framework to the DUC evalua-
tion exercises.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998795571428571">
QARLA (Amig´o et al., 2005) is a framework that
uses similarity to models as a building block for
the evaluation of automatic summarisation systems.
The input of QARLA is a summarisation task, a set
of test cases, a set of similarity metrics, and sets of
models and automatic summaries (peers) for each
test case. With such a testbed, QARLA provides:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999095285714286">
• A measure, QUEEN, which combines assorted
similarity metrics to estimate the quality of au-
tomatic summarisers.
• A measure, KING, to select the best combina-
tion of similarity metrics.
• An estimation, JACK, of the reliability of the
testbed for evaluation purposes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998984421052632">
The QARLA framework does not rely on human
judges. It is interesting, however, to find out how
well an evaluation using QARLA correlates with hu-
man judges, and whether QARLA can provide ad-
ditional insights into an evaluation based on human
assessments.
In this paper, we apply the QARLA framework
(QUEEN, KING and JACK measures) to the out-
put of two different evaluation exercises: DUC 2004
tasks 2 and 5 (Over and Yen, 2004). Task 2 re-
quires short (one-hundred word) summaries for as-
sorted document sets; Task 5 consists of generating
a short summary in response to a “Who is” question.
In Section 2, we summarise the QARLA evalua-
tion framework; in Section 3, we describe the sim-
ilarity metrics used in the experiments. Section 4
discusses the results of the QARLA framework us-
ing such metrics on the DUC testbeds. Finally, Sec-
tion 5 draws some conclusions.

QARLA uses similarity to models for the evalua-
tion of automatic summarisation systems. Here we
summarise its main features; the reader may refer to
(Amig´o et al., 2005) for details.
The input of the framework is:

<listItem confidence="0.9959451">
• A summarisation task (e.g. topic oriented, in-
formative multi-document summarisation on a
given domain/corpus).
• A set T of test cases (e.g. topic/document set
pairs for the example above)
• A set of summaries M produced by humans
(models), and a set of automatic summaries A
(peers), for every test case.
• A set X of similarity metrics to compare sum-
maries.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959895">
With this input, QARLA provides three main
measures that we describe below.

2.1 QUEEN: Estimating the quality of an
automatic summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999503333333333">
QUEEN operates under the assumption that a sum-
mary is better if it is closer to the model summaries
according to all metrics; it is defined as the probabil-
ity, measured on M x M x M, that for every metric
in X the automatic summary a is closer to a model
than two models to each other:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.937956">
QUEENX,M(a) ≡ P(∀x ∈ X.x(a, m) ≥ x(m&apos;, m&amp;quot;))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.947257216216216">
where a is the automatic summary being eval-
uated, (m, m&apos;, m&apos;&apos;) are three models in M, and
x(a, m) stands for the similarity of m to a. QUEEN
is stated as a probability, and therefore its range of
values is [0, 1].
We can think of the QUEEN measure as using a
set of tests (every similarity metric in X) to falsify
the hypothesis that a given summary a is a model.
Given (a, m, m&apos;, m&apos;&apos;), we test x(a, m) &gt; x(m&apos;, m&apos;&apos;)
for each metric x. a is accepted as a model only if
it passes the test for every metric. QUEEN(a) is,
then, the probability of acceptance for a in the sam-
ple space M x M x M.
This measure has some interesting properties: (i)
it is able to combine different similarity metrics
into a single evaluation measure; (ii) it is not af-
fected by the scale properties of individual metrics,
i.e. it does not require metric normalisation and
it is not affected by metric weighting. (iii) Peers
which are very far from the set of models all receive
QUEEN=0. In other words, QUEEN does not distin-
guish between very poor summarisation strategies.
(iv) The value of QUEEN is maximised for peers
that “merge” with the models under all metrics in X.
(v) The universal quantifier on the metric parameter
x implies that adding redundant metrics do not bias
the result of QUEEN.
Now the question is: which similarity metrics
are adequate to evaluate summaries? Imagine that
we use a similarity metric based on sentence co-
selection; it might happen that humans do not agree
on which sentences to select, and therefore emulat-
ing their sentence selection behaviour is both easy
(nobody agrees with each other) and useless. We
need to take into account which are the features that
human summaries do share, and evaluate according
to them. This is provided by the KING measure.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.6234285">
2.2 KING: estimating the quality of similarity
metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996752">
The measure KINGM,A(X) estimates the quality of
a set of similarity metrics X using a set of models
M and a set of peers A. KING is defined as the
probability that a model has higher QUEEN value
than any peer in a test sample. Formally:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993857">
KINGM,A(X) ≡
P(∀a ∈ A, QUEENM,X(m) &gt; QUEENM,X(a))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996877">
For example, an ideal metric -that puts all models
together-would give QUEEN(m) = 1 for all mod-
els, and QUEEN(a) = 0 for all peers which are not
put together with the models, obtaining KING = 1.
KING satisfies several interesting properties: (i)
KING does not depend on the scale properties of the
metric; (ii) Adding repeated or very similar peers
do not alter the KING measure, which avoids one
way of biasing the measure. (iii) the KING value of
random and constant metrics is zero or close to zero.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995491">
2.3 JACK: reliability of the peer set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999678095238095">
Once we detect a difference in quality between two
summarisation systems, the question is now whether
this result is reliable. Would we get the same results
using a different test set (different examples, differ-
ent human summarisers (models) or different base-
line systems)?
The first step is obviously to apply statistical sig-
nificance tests to the results. But even if they give a
positive result, it might be insufficient. The problem
is that the estimation of the probabilities in KING
assumes that the sample sets M, A are not biased.
If M, A are biased, the results can be statistically
significant and yet unreliable. The set of examples
and the behaviour of human summarisers (models)
should be somehow controlled either for homogene-
ity (if the intended profile of examples and/or users
is narrow) or representativity (if it is wide). But how
to know whether the set of automatic summaries is
representative and therefore is not penalising certain
automatic summarisation strategies?
This is addressed by the JACK measure:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.787197">

<equation confidence="0.870995666666667">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844785714286">
i.e. the probability over all model summaries m of
finding a couple of automatic summaries a, a&apos; which
are closer to m than to each other according to all
metrics. This measure satisfies three desirable prop-
erties: (i) it can be enlarged by increasing the sim-
ilarity of the peers to the models (the x(m, a) fac-
tor in the inequalities), i.e. enhancing the quality of
the peer set; (ii) it can also be enlarged by decreas-
ing the similarity between automatic summaries (the
x(a, a&apos;) factor in the inequality), i.e. augmenting the
diversity of (independent) automatic summarisation
strategies represented in the test bed; (iii) adding el-
ements to A cannot diminish the JACK value, be-
cause of the existential quantifier on a, a&apos;.

3 Selection of similarity metrics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857357142857">
Each different similarity metric characterises differ-
ent features of a summary. Our first objective is
to select the best set of metrics, that is, the metrics
which best characterise the human summaries (mod-
els) as opposed to automatic summaries. The second
objective is to obtain as much information as possi-
ble about the behaviour of automatic summaries.
In this Section, we begin by describing a set of
59 metrics used as a starting point. Some of them
provide overlapping information; the second step is
then to select a subset of metrics that minimises re-
dundancy and, at the same time, maximises quality
(KING values). Finally, we analyse the characteris-
tics of the selected metrics.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999044">
3.1 Similarity metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989982365384615">
For this work, we have considered the following
similarity metrics:
ROUGE based metrics (R): ROUGE (Lin and
Hovy, 2003) estimates the quality of an au-
tomatic summary on the basis of the n-gram
coverage related to a set of human summaries
(models). Although ROUGE is an evaluation
metric, we can adapt it to behave as a sim-
ilarity metric between pairs of summaries if
we consider only one model in the computa-
tion. There are different kinds of ROUGE met-
rics such as ROUGE-W, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-
1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-3, ROUGE-4, etc. (Lin,
2004b). Each of these metrics has been ap-
plied over summaries with three preprocessing
options: with stemming and stopword removal
(type c); only with stopwords removal (type b);
or without any kind of preprocessing (type a).
All these combinations give 24 similarity met-
rics based on ROUGE.
Inverted ROUGE based metrics (Rpre): ROUGE
metrics are recall oriented. If we reverse the di-
rection of the similarity computation, we obtain
precision oriented metrics (i.e. Rpre(a, b) =
R(b, a)). In this way, we generate another 24
metrics based on inverted ROUGE.
TruncatedVectModel (TVM,,,): This family of met-
rics compares the distribution of the n most
relevant terms from original documents in the
summaries. The process is the following: (1)
obtaining the n most frequent lemmas ignoring
stopwords; (2) generating a vector with the rel-
ative frequency of each term in the summary;
(3) calculating the similarity between two vec-
tors as the inverse of the Euclidean distance.
We have used 9 variants of this measure with
n = 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,128, 256, 512.
AveragedSentencelengthSim (AVLS): This is a very
simple metric that compares the average length
of the sentences in two summaries. It can be
useful to compare the degree of abstraction of
the summaries.
GRAMSIM: This similarity metric compares the
distribution of the part-of-speech tags in the
two summaries. The processing is the follow-
ing: (1) part-of-speech tagging of summaries
using TreeTagger ; (2) generation of a vector
with the tags frequency for each summary; (3)
calculation of the similarity between two vec-
tors as the inverse of the Euclidean distance.
This similarity metric is not content oriented,
but syntax-oriented.

3.2 Clustering similarity metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98433528125">
From the set of metrics described above we have 57
(24+24+9) content oriented metrics, plus two met-
rics based on stylistic features (AVLS and GRAM-
SIM). However, the 57 metrics characterising sum-
mary contents are highly redundant. Thus, cluster-
ing similar metrics seems desirable.
We perform an automatic clustering process us-
ing the following notion of proximity between two
metric sets:
sim(X, X&apos;) _ Prob[H(X) +-+ H(X&apos;)]
where H(X) _ `dx E X.x(a, m) &gt; x(m&apos;, m&amp;quot;)
Two metrics sets are similar, according to the for-
mula, if they behave similarly with respect to the
QUEEN condition (H predicate in the formula),
i.e. the probability that the two sets of metrics dis-
criminate the same automatic summaries when they
are compared to the same pair of models.
Figure 1 shows the clustering of similarity met-
rics for the DUC 2004 Task 2. The number of clus-
ters was fixed in 10. After the clustering process, the
48 ROUGE metrics are grouped in 7 sets, and the 9
TVM metrics are grouped in 3 sets. In each clus-
ter, the metric with highest KING has been marked
in boldface. Note that the ROUGE-c metrics (with
stemming) with highest KING are those based on re-
call whereas the ROUGE-a/b metrics (without stem-
ming) are those based on precision. Regarding TVM
clusters, the metrics with highest KING in each clus-
ter are those based on a higher number of terms.
Finally, we select the metric with highest KING
in each group, obtaining the 10 most representative
metrics.

3.3 Best evaluation metric: KING values
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8423896">
Figure 2 shows the KING values for the selected
similarity metrics, which represent how every metric
characterises model summaries as opposed to auto-
matic summaries. These are the main results:
• The last column shows the best metric set,
considering all possible metric combinations.
In both DUC tasks, the best combination is
{Rpre-W-1.2.b, TVM.512. This metric set gets
better KING values than any individual metric
in isolation (17% better than the second best for
task 2, and 23% better for task 5). This is an in-
teresting result confirming that we can improve
our ability to characterise human summaries
just by combining standard similarity metrics
in the QARLA framework. Note also that both
metrics in the best set are content-oriented.
• Rpre-W.1.2.b (inverted ROUGE measure, us-
ing non-contiguous word sequences, remov-
ing stopwords, without stemming) obtains the
highest individual KING for task 2, and is one
of the best in task 5, confirming that ROUGE-
based metrics are a robust way of evaluating
summaries, and indicating that non-contiguous
word sequences can be more useful for evalua-
tion purposes than n-grams.

• TVM metrics get higher values when consid-
ering more terms (TVM.512), confirming that
comparing with just a few terms (e.g. TVM.4)
is not informative enough.
• Overall, KING values are higher for task
5, suggesting that there is more agreement
between human summaries in topic-oriented
tasks.

3.4 Reliability of the results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991">
The JACK measure estimates the reliability of
QARLA results, and is correlated with the diversity
of automatic summarisation strategies included in
the testbed. In principle, the larger the number of au-
tomatic summaries, the higher the JACK values we
should obtain. The important point is to determine
when JACK values tend to stabilise; at this point, it
is not useful to add more automatic summaries with-
out introducing new summarisation strategies.
Figure 3 shows how JACKRpre-W,TVM.512 values
grow when adding automatic summaries. For more
than 10 systems, JACK values grow slower in both
tasks. Absolute JACK values are higher in Task 2
than in task 5, indicating that systems tend to pro-
duce more similar summaries in Task 5 (perhaps be-
cause it is a topic-oriented task). This result suggests
that we should incorporate more diverse summarisa-
tion strategies in Task 5 to enhance the reliability of
the testbed for evaluation purposes with QARLA.

metrics. Figure 4 shows the QUEEN{Rpre-W,TVM.512}
values for each participating system in DUC 2004,
also including the model summaries. As expected,
model summaries obtain the highest QUEEN values

The manual ranking generated in DUC is based on a
set of human-produced evaluation criteria, whereas
the QARLA framework gives more weight to the as-

are correlated. Indeed, this is the case: the Pearson
correlation between manual and QUEEN rankings is
0.92 for the Task 2 and 0.96 for the Task 5.

The best metric combination leaves out similarity
metrics based on stylistic features. It is interesting,
however, to see how automatic summaries behave
with respect to this kind of features. Perhaps the
most remarkable fact about stylistic similarities is
that, in the case of the GRAMSIM metric, task 2
and task 5 exhibit a rather different behaviour (see
Figure 6). In task 2, systems merge with the models,
while in task 5 the QUEEN values of the systems
are inferior to the models. This suggests that there
is some stylistic component in models that systems
are not capturing in the topic-oriented task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999986433333333">
The methodology which is closest to our frame-
work is ORANGE (Lin, 2004a), which evaluates a
similarity metric using the average ranks obtained
by reference items within a baseline set. As in
our framework, ORANGE performs an automatic
meta-evaluation, there is no need for human assess-
ments, and it does not depend on the scale properties
of the metric being evaluated (because changes of
scale preserve rankings). The ORANGE approach
is, indeed, intimately related to the original QARLA
measure introduced in (Amigo et al., 2004).
There are several approaches to the automatic
evaluation of summarisation and Machine Transla-
tion systems (Culy and Riehemann, 2003; Coughlin,
2003). Probably the most significant improvement
over ORANGE is the ability to combine automati-
cally the information of different metrics. Our im-
pression is that a comprehensive automatic evalua-
tion of a summary must necessarily capture different
aspects of the problem with different metrics, and
that the results of every individual checking (metric)
should not be combined in any prescribed algebraic
way (such as a linear weighted combination). Our
framework satisfies this condition.
ORANGE, however, has also an advantage over
the QARLA framework, namely that it can be used
for evaluation metrics which are not based on sim-
ilarity between model/peer pairs. For instance,
ROUGE can be applied directly in the ORANGE
framework without any reformulation.

The second objective is to obtain as much information as possible about the behaviour of automatic summaries. In this Section, we begin by describing a set of 59 metrics used as a starting point. Some of them provide overlapping information; the second step is then to select a subset of metrics that minimises redundancy and, at the same time, maximises quality (KING values). Finally, we analyse the characteristics of the selected metrics. 3.1 Similarity metrics For this work, we have considered the following similarity metrics: ROUGE based metrics (R): ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) estimates the quality of an automatic summary on the basis of the n-gram coverage related to a set of human summaries (models). Although ROUGE is an evaluation metric, we can adapt it to behave as a similarity metric between pairs of summaries if we consider only one model in the computation. There are different kinds of ROUGE metrics such as ROUGE-W, ROUGE-L, ROUGE1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-3, ROUGE-4, etc. (Lin, 2004b). Each of these metrics has been applied over summaries with three preprocessing options: with stemming and stopword removal (type c); only with stopwords removal (type b); or without </context>

In task 2, systems merge with the models, while in task 5 the QUEEN values of the systems are inferior to the models. This suggests that there is some stylistic component in models that systems are not capturing in the topic-oriented task. 5 Related work The methodology which is closest to our framework is ORANGE (Lin, 2004a), which evaluates a similarity metric using the average ranks obtained by reference items within a baseline set.

The QARLA framework does not rely on human judges. It is interesting, however, to find out how well an evaluation using QARLA correlates with human judges, and whether QARLA can provide additional insights into an evaluation based on human assessments. In this paper, we apply the QARLA framework (QUEEN, KING and JACK measures) to the output of two different evaluation exercises: DUC 2004 tasks 2 and 5 (Over and Yen, 2004). Task 2 requires short (one-hundred word) summaries for assorted document sets; Task 5 consists of generating a short summary in response to a “Who is” question. In Section 2, we summarise the QARLA evaluation framework; in Section 3, we describe the similarity metrics used in the experiments. Section 4 discusses the results of the QARLA framework using such metrics on the DUC testbeds. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions. 2 The QARLA evaluation framework QARLA uses similarity to models for the evaluation of automatic summarisation systems.
