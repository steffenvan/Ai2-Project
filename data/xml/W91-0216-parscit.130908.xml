This paper argues that it is impossible to separate lexical and encyclopedic knowledge
and describes an attempt to build a large lexical database that contains the range of
information needed to make a parser or a text generation system interpret and use
words and phrases correctly.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999903769230769">
Any natural language processing system needs both knowledge about words and knowl-
edge about the world. Many natural language systems divide these two kinds of knowledge
into two knowledge bases, which we call the lexicon and the encyclopedia for the purposes
of this discussion. We argue that the distinction between the lexicon and the encyclo-
pedia is difficult to maintain both in theory and in practice. We describe the design
and development of a large lexical database intended to support parsing, generation, and
information retrieval applications. We claim that these applications require information
of many different kinds, some of which is traditionally stored in a dictionary, some in a
thesaurus, and some in an encyclopedia.
We need to support not just alphabetic access to this information but access through
semantic links. Bierman [1964] was one of the first to describe lexical-semantic links
between words. They define the basic organization of semantic information, he claims.
He paints an image of a very large single-page dictionary with language-specific nodes
connected by semantic relations. ,
Can we distinguish between the lexicon and the encyclopedia in this context? Bierwisch
and Kiefer [1970] assume that both kinds of information are contained in the same lexical
entry. The distinction between linguistic or lexical and encyclopedic knowledge, they say,
corresponds to the difference between the core and the periphery of a lexical entry, where:
The core of a lexical reading comprises all and only those semantic spec-
ifications that determine, roughly speaking, its place within the system of
dictionary entries, i.e., delimit it from other (non-synonymous) entries. The
periphery consists of those semantic specifications which could be removed
from its reading without changing its relation to other lexical readings within
the same grammar. [Bierwisch and Kiefer 1970, 69-70]
The major difficulty with this criterion is its instability. As new entries are added to
the system, information sufficient to distinguish one entry from another may have to be

<bodyText confidence="0.998442170731707">
shifted from the periphery to the core — and thus from the encyclopedia to the lexicon.
For instance, suppose a new entry, &amp;quot;leopard — a large wild cat&amp;quot; is to be added. The entire
lexicon must be searched for entries that mention large wild cats. If one is found, say
&amp;quot;lion — a large wild cat,&amp;quot; then enough information must be added to both definitions to
differentiate leopard and lion from each other.
Apresyan, Mel&apos;Zuk, and Zolkovsky run into the same difficulty of distinguishing lexical
and encyclopedic information in attempting to define the lexical universe of a word CO.
The main themes dealt with under the heading &apos;lexical universe&apos; are: 1) the
types of CO; 2) the main part or phases of CO; 3) typical situations occurring
before and after CO, etc. Thus, the section lexical universe for the word skis
consists of a list of the types of skis (racing, mountain, jumping, hunting), their
main parts (skis proper and bindings), the main objects and actions necessary
for the correct use (exploitation) of skis (poles, grease, to wax), the main types
of activities connected with skis (a ski-trip, a ski-race ...) ... the sections
contain only such words as are necessary for talking on the topic, and nothing
else. [Apresyan et al. 1970]
The problem is that &amp;quot;what is needed for talking about the topic&amp;quot; depends very much
on who is going to do the talking. The definition of ski in Webster&apos;s New International
(2nd edition) begins:
One of a pair of narrow strips of wood, metal, or plastic, usually in com-
bination, bound one on each foot and used for gliding over a snow-covered
surface.
Apresyan et al. do not provide for three of the items mentioned here: what skis
are made of (wood, plastic, or metal), what shape they come in (long and narrow) and
where they belong spatially (on the human foot). Yet these items could be essential to
understanding implicit inferences in a story.
It was snowing. Jim took out his skis and the can of wax. He began to
wax the wood carefully. Then he looked for the poles.
It could be needed to answer questions:
Jim skied rapidly down the mountain.
Question: What was Jim wearing?
slippers skis sandals
Although in English and Russian it is possible to refer to skis without knowing that
they are long and narrow it is not possible in Navajo or certain African languages where
physical shapes determine verb forms. While the entry in Webster&apos;s New International
goes on at length beyond the sentence given above, it does not include all the items that
Apresyan mentions. Clearly the boundaries of the lexical universe are not well defined.
The dichotomy between the lexicon and the encyclopedia is particularly hard to pre-
serve during the updating process. Recognizing definitions phrased in ordinary English
is difficult [Bierwisch and Kiefer, 1970]. This information does not come neatly packaged
and marked &amp;quot;for the lexicon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;for the encyclopedia&amp;quot;. How do we tell which is which?
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994799">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997323711111112">
Addition of information to one part of the entry may necessitate updating other parts
of the entry. For example, if we learn that record is a verb as well as a noun we need
to add morphological information and describe the relation between record and erase.
We should probably describe recording materials, as well. We also need to add that
the verb record is a factive, i.e., the a-gsprtion that someone records an action implies
the assertion that the action really occurreed. Which of this information is lexical and
which is encyclopedic? Both theoretical and practical arguments convince us that the
lexicon-encyclopedia dichtomy is not valid.
Information about semantic relationships between words - thesaurus information - is
needed for many reasons. It is crucial to semantic access. Hirst and Morris [1990] have
shown that it is fundamental to language understanding. Fox [1980, 1988], Nutter et al.
[1988] and Wang et al. [1985] have used thesaurus information to improve the results of an
information retrieval system. Eiler [1979] has shown the importance of lexical relationships
in human text generation. Lee [1991] is using this kind of information to generate cohesive
text by machine. Zhang [1990] is using it to generate explanations.
We need to store all this information not just for words but for phrases. Becker [1975]
argues cogently that language is ordinarily generated in large swatches, not a word at a
time. Commercial dictionaries include many phrasal entries. For example, approximately
16% of the main entries in Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary are phrases and many
other phrases appear as &amp;quot;runons&amp;quot; at the foot of other entries. Charniak [1972] makes it
clear that &amp;quot;birthday party&amp;quot; needs an entry of its own — and shows also that its lexical
universe is huge.
2 Organization of the Lexical Database
Because we want to see our lexicon used by as many people as possible, we have sought
sources for our data that will permit us to distribute the database to anyone who plans
to use for research purposes. Collins Publishers has generously agreed we may give a
copy of our lexicon including data derived from the first edition of the Collins English
Dictionary (CED) to anyone who qualifies to obtain a machine-readable copy from the
Data Collection Initiative. Another valuable source of lexical data is the Brandeis Verb
Lexicon constructed by Grimshaw and Jackendoff [1985]. Sven Jacobson [1964, 1978] has
kindly allowed us to keyboard and distribute his Dictionary of Adverb Placement. We
have also put into machine readable form the Adjective, Adverb, Noun, and Verb Lists
developed from Householder&apos;s NSF project of twenty-five years ago [1964, 1965].
Our lexical database is organized and stored using the Oracle Relational Database
Management System. Our database relations (which we will call tables to distinguish
them from semantic relations) include a main table with the word, and its homograph
and sense number (from the CED) combined into one field, the part of speech, and the
source. Each word with a different homograph and sense number (assigned in CED) is
put into a different entry for the purpose of lexical disambiguation. Words that have no
homograph or sense number in CED are assigned a code of —1. We have also designed
separate tables for each part of speech. Each table contains different information specific
to that part of speech.
The noun table contains information about whether a noun is regular or irregular,
abstract or concrete, count or mass, human, animate or inanimate, singular or plural,
common or proper, collective or not, what gender it is, and whether it appears in an
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992536">
181
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980466666667">
Indiana noun list. We have a separate table for Indiana nouns (those that support that
clauses) giving the number of the Indiana list [Bridgeman 1965]. Then there is still another
table that gives the definition and an example for each Indiana noun list. We also have a
separate table for nouns with irregular plurals, like child, goose, and ox.
There are a number of different verb tables. The main verb table tells whether a verb
is regular or irregular, dynamic or stative, transitive or intransitive (or both), takes a
sentential complement or not, can be put into passive voice or not. If it is in a speech act
class [Wierzbicka, 1989] or a performative class [McCawley, 1979] then the class will be
given. Then there is a table for strong verbs with their forms. There is a case table giving
information about verb arguments. If a verb takes sentential complements it appears in a
special table that tells what complementizers the verb takes, its implicative class (factive,
etc.), whether it is subject to raising, and whether it appears in an Indiana verb list. The
Indiana verb table gives Indiana verb classes in which the verb appears. There is yet
another table that gives the defining information for the Indiana verb lists.
The adjective table indicates whether the adjective is dynamic or stative, gradable or
non-gradable, inherent or non-inherent. An adjective may be intensitive. It may appear
as a post-determiner. It may be a general adjective susceptible to subjective measure,
a general adjective susceptible to objective measure including size or shape, or color.
It may be a denominal adjective denoting material, or a denominal adjective denoting
provenance or style. Information about the semantic classes an adjective belongs to is
essential to determining its position in the sentence during text generation. While most
adjectives can occur in both attributive and predicate positions, some are non-attributive,
others are non-predicative. We also have a table for unpredictable adjective inflections
and another for Indiana adjectives [Householder et al. 1965]. Our adverb tables have been
fully discussed elsewhere [Pin-Ngern et al. 1990].
We also have a table listing lexical-semantic relations with definitions and examples
and then several tables of lexical- semantic relationships [Ahlswede and Evens, 1988a].
Our plans include tables containing other information from CED such as definitions,
pronunciations, and etymologies, but these have not been built since none of us is currently
using that information.

3 Entries for Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965333333333">
We have been concerned for several years with the design of entries for phrases; it seems
apparent that we need to record the same kind of information for phrases as for single word
entries and that they are involved in the same lexical relations as other words and more
besides [Markowitz et al. 1988; Ahlswede et al. 1988]. Li and Markowitz are concentrating
on questions about phrasal verbs. Problems about the kinds of constructions that these
verbs take part in have often been discussed in the literature but not resolved. Markowitz
has devised several series of examples that we are trying out on every passerby who
happens to be a native speaker of English. The data collected so far is chaotic; it suggests
that the explanations in the literature are over-simplified. CED contains many thousands
of phrasal main entries and many more phrases appear as runons in other entries. We
are trying to design programs to translate these phrasal entries into entries in the lexical
database.

4 Arguments for Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933208333334">
Information about appropriate arguments for verbs is an obvious need. We are building
a table that indicates for each sense of the verb what cases it takes, how those cases are
syntactically realized (as subject, object, or object of a preposition), whether it is obliga,ory
or not, and what are the selection restrictions on the fillers of those case slots. Joanne
Dardaine wrote a program to build skeleton entries for the verbs in the Brandeis Verb
Lexicon [Grimshaw and Jackendoff, 1985]. Then we sit around and argue about additional
examples, beginning with verbs that we are using in text generation in a tutoring system
for cardiovascular physiology [Zhang et al. 1990] and in an explanation subsystem for an
expert system for stroke [Lee and Evens 1991]. Grimshaw&apos;s new book [1990] on argument
patterns has been of the greatest help. Given the theoretical disagreements between
Fillmore [1970], Bresnan [1982], and Grimshaw [1990], it is not possible to come up with
an ideal solution. When in doubt we try to make the finest distinctions we can, in the
belief that it will be easier for others to clump our categories together than to divide them
further.
Clearly much of what we are doing for verbs needs to be done for adjectives and
adverbs. Much of the necessary research for adverbs has been carried out by House-
holder&apos;s group [1965] and by Sven Jacobson and published in very detailed and useful
forms [1964, 1978]. Jacobson has generously given permission for us &apos;to include this work
in our database. Sumali Pin-Ngern Conlon is using the superb computing facilities of the
University of Mississippi, where she is now a faculty member, to put this material into
machine readable form and to combine it with the information from the Indiana Adverb
Lists [Householder et al. 1965]. We are trying to locate and understand more of the
research on adjectives such as the work of Ljung at Goteborg, before we start to enhance
our adjective tables appropriately.

5 Sentential Complements
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999969">
We have split off the problem of sentential complements from other arguments for verbs
because we wanted to store this information in separate database tables and because there
are there are separate rich sources of information. Yu-Fen Huang has entered the verbs
from Wierzbicka&apos;s list of speech act verbs. We are trying to find out if CED synonyms of
speech act verbs are also speech act verbs and if they sometimes fit into the same speech
act classes [Wierzbicka 1989] or performative classes, using McCawley&apos;s [1979] categories.
Pin-Ngern wrote a program to put Indiana Verb List verbs [Alexander and Kunz 1964;
Bridgeman et al. 1965] into tables in the database. Huang is rewriting that program to
include further information and trying to correlate Wierzbicka&apos;s [1989] speech act verbs
and the Indiana verbs with their CED homograph and sense numbers.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.992794" genericHeader="method">
6 Sublanguage Information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997545">
CED contains quite a lot of information about sublanguage and register (e.g., entries begin
&amp;quot;a legal term for&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a slang name for&amp;quot;). We are trying to figure out how and where to
capture this information so that we can study it more effectively and also so that we can
figure out to use it to make appropriate subsets of the lexical database.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998301">
183
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992875">
Of course, sublanguage affects the syntactic correlates of words as well as the lexical
ones. It is clear that we need to relate syntactic information in the lexical database to a
given sense and homographic number.
We are designing tools to help us deliver subsets of the database to potential users.
Clearly we need to be able to make subsets on the basis of sublanguage information as
well as from word lists given us by people who want data to match. We expect to make
this kind of data available in flat files (unless the user has an Oracle Relational Database
Management System). All the attributes currently recorded in the database are also
defined in the database. Any user of the database will be provided with this information.
We expect that most of these users will need add to information to the data that we give
them. So far our lexical data acquisition tools function mainly as SQL forms [Evens et a/.
1989]. We need to provide flat file versions of these tools.

7 Tools for Accessing and Building the Database
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930777777778">
We a re designing two families of tools, one for building the database and one for accessing
it. Database construction tools themselves fall into three categories. One group of tools
is intended to collect information from human informants to make it easy to add material
to the lexicon for some special purpose or to extend existing information. For example,
we have a tool to examine synonyms of verbs on the Indiana Verb Lists that also take
sentential complements and add them to the correct lists [Evens et al. 1989]. Another
group of tools is intended to take explicit information from a source and put it into the
right table or tables. The third group of tools, most of which were originally built for
sublanguage study, is designed to tackle text, sometimes dictionary definitions, sometimes
other text, and extract information from it. These tools make lists of words and phrases
and count them and parse text. Frank Rinaldo has built most of these tools and is working
on bigger and better ones.
Our Oracle database expert, Robert Strutz, is working on tools to access the database.
These tools extract information to be used by a parser or a text generation program. Other
tools in this category check the database for missing data and make reports. One tool
makes a list of nouns that appear in subsidiary noun tables but not in the main noun
table, for example. Still other tools make subsets of the database for different kinds of
user specifications.

8 Current Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994525">
A small subset of the lexical database, the stroke lexicon [Ahlswede and Evens, 1988b],
is being used in experiments in information retrieval and text generation. Wang et al.
[1989] are using thesaurus information to enhance queries in an interactive information
retrieval system, which operates as a separate PC program and carries out searches of the
stroke literature either independently or in support of an expert system. Lee and Evens
[1991] are using the stroke lexicon to generate explanations for an expert system for stroke.
Information about lexical-semantic relations is used in an experiment to make that text
cohesive; other lexical information is used to support the basic generation process.

9 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971076923077">
We are trying to build a big lexical database that contains detailed information about all
its entries. We argue in support of this enterprise that much information often classified
as encyclopedic is needed by natural language processing programs trying to carry out
tasks in parsing, generation, and information retrieval. In particular, the need for the-
saurus information (information about lexical and semantic relationships between words)
is becoming increasingly clear. We are convinced that phrasal entries need information
that is at least as rich and detailed as that provided for individual words.
We are trying to make this lexicon usable by many different people for many different
tasks, with the goal of providing it free to anyone who can use it. This means that we must
build it out of pieces that are readily available to the research community, that we must
be able to provide subsets of many different kinds, and that we must provide tools so that
others can access these files and add to them whatever further entries and information
they need for particular applications.
