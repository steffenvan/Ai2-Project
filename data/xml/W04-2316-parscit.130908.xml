Acknowledgments, e.g., “yeah” and “uh-huh,”
are ubiquitous in human conversation but are
rarer in human-computer interaction. What
interface factors might contribute to this differ-
ence? Using a simple spoken-language inter-
face that responded to acknowledgments, we
compared subjects’ use of acknowledgments
when the interface used recorded speech with
that seen when the interface used synthesized
speech. Contrary to our hypothesis, we saw a
drop in the numbers of subjects using acknowl-
edgments: subjects appeared to interpret the
recorded-voice interface as signalling a more
limited interface. These results were consistent
for both Mexican Spanish and American
English versions of the interface.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993646">
In previous studies, we showed that subjects use
acknowledgments and politeness words when interacting
with a simple spoken-language application even when
the interface does not offer such behaviors itself (Ward
and Heeman, 2000; Ward et al., 2003). In post-experi-
ment interviews conducted as part of that study, 50% of
the subjects (11 in the English-language condition, 9 in
the Spanish) had thought that they might be more likely
to use acknowledgments if the interface had a more
human-like voice. In this study, we tested that hypothe-
sis: we examined the effect of changing the interface
prompts from synthesized speech to recorded speech.
The term “acknowledgment” is from Clark and
Schaefer (1989), who describe a hierarchy of methods
by which one conversant may signal that another’s
contribution has been understood well enough to allow
the conversation to proceed. Acknowledgments often
appear in English as “uh-huh” and in Spanish as “ajá.”
Acknowledgments, also called “back-channels” by some
researchers (e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997), are one
of several meta-dialogue behaviors that people use to
control the flow of conversation.
Meta-dialogue behaviors such as acknowledgment
are of interest because of their role in managing turn-tak-
ing: although acknowledgments may preface a new con-
tribution by the same speaker (Novick and Sutton,
1994), often they occur alone as a single-phrase turn that
appears to serve the purpose of explicitly declining an
opportunity to take a turn (Sacks et al., 1974). If
acknowledgment behavior is incorporated in spoken-lan-
guage systems, it may offer a more fluid and adaptable
means of managing turn-taking and pacing in human-
computer interaction.
Although some research systems incorporate
acknowledgments (e.g., Aist, 1998; Iwase and Ward,
1998; Okato et al., 1998), real-world spoken-language
interfaces generally don’t allow acknowledgments to
serve their turn-taking purpose. Turn-taking is com-
pletely controlled by one conversant, usually the system.
To reduce errors, designers of spoken-language systems
create prompts that guide the user toward short, focused,
in-vocabulary responses (e.g., Basson et al., 1996; Cole
et al., 1997). In many systems, the use of barge-in
defeats the common interpretation of an acknowledg-
ment: if the user speaks, the system quits speaking and
begins interpreting the user utterance. If the user
intended to signal that the system should continue, the
effect is exactly the opposite of the one intended. Thus,
current design practices both discourage and render
meaningless the standard uses of acknowledgments.

The study design, described below, is identical to that
used in our baseline study (Ward et al., 2003) except that
the interface prompts and messages were delivered using
recorded human voices instead of synthesized voice.
These studies were conducted in both American English
and Mexican Spanish.

2.1 Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995714285714">
We did not want to explicitly instruct or require subjects
to use acknowledgment behavior, as that would tell us
nothing about their preferences. Instead, we wanted to
create a situation in which subjects would have a reason
to use acknowledgments, perhaps even gain an advan-
tage from doing so, while still keeping the behavior
optional. Conversants are likely to offer acknowledg-
ments and repetitions when complex or important infor-
mation is being transcribed, especially when the cost of
making an error may be high. Acknowledgments in this
context may serve a dual purpose of conveying under-
standing and of controlling the pace of the interaction.
Furthermore, there may be more verbal acknowledg-
ments offered during telephone-based interaction than
during face-to-face interaction (Cohen and Oviatt,
1993). We therefore designed a task in which the subject
is asked to make written notes of information presented
verbally over the telephone.
We selected the domain of a telephone interface to
E-mail. Subjects were told that the computer system
would read E-mail messages to them over the telephone
and that their task was to locate and transcribe particular
items of information contained in the messages, e.g.,
“How do you get to the coffee house?” The messages
included both “interesting” information that was to be
copied and “uninteresting” information that was not, so
that subjects would want to move through the “uninter-
esting” material more quickly. In this way we hoped to
motivate subjects to try to control the pace at which
information was presented.
The E-mail was presented in segments roughly cor-
responding to a long phrase, with each segment followed
by a pause of about five seconds. Five seconds is a long
response time, uncomfortably so for human conversa-
tion, so we hoped that this lengthy pause would encour-
age the subjects to take the initiative in controlling the
pace of the interaction. If the subject said nothing, the
system would continue by presenting the next message
segment. Subjects could reduce this delay by acknowl-
edging the contribution, e.g., “okay,” or by commanding
the system to continue, e.g., “go on” or “continuar.” The
system signalled the possibility of controlling the delay
by asking the subject the question “Are you ready to go
on” or “Estas listo(a) para continuar” after the first
pause. This prompting was repeated for every third
pause in which the subject said nothing. In this way we
hoped to suggest to the subjects that they could control
the wait time without explicitly telling them to do so.
On the surface, there is no functional difference in
system behavior between a subject’s use of a command
to move the system onward (e.g., “go on,” “next,” “con-
tinue”) and the use of an acknowledgment. In either
case, the system responds by presenting the next mes-
sage segment, and in fact it eventually presents the next
segment even if the subject says nothing at all. Thus, the
design allows the subject to choose freely between
accepting the system’s pace, or commanding the system
to continue, or acknowledging the presentations in a
fashion more typical of human conversation. In this way,
we hoped to understand how the subject preferred to
interact with the computer.
Subjects were told that the study’s purpose was to
assess the understandability and usability of the inter-
face, and that their task was to find the answers to a list
of questions. They were given no instructions in the use
of the program beyond the information that they were to
talk to it using normal, everyday speech.
We tested a total of 40 subjects, balanced for gender
and language. Subjects were solicited from the Univer-
sity of Texas at El Paso campus. They ranged in age
from 18 to 65, with most being between 20 and 25. Each
subject was paid $10.00 for participating in the study.
We used a Wizard of Oz protocol as a way to allow
the system to respond to acknowledgments and to pro-
vide robustness in handling repetitions. The wizard’s
interface was constructed using the Rapid Application
Developer in the Center for Spoken Language Under-
standing Toolkit (Sutton et al., 1998). A simple button
panel allowed the wizard to select the appropriate
response from the actions supported by the application.
The application functionality was limited to suggest real-
istic abilities for a current spoken-language interface.
The subject could request a message by message num-
ber, for example, but not by content or sender.
The interface prompts and messages were presented
using recorded human voices. The message texts were
presented in a male voice, and the control portions of the
interface were in a female voice. It was hoped that the
two voices would help the subjects determine the state of
the interface: delivering message text vs. controlling the
interface functions.

2.2 Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987842105263">
In comparing the strategies used to control the length of
the pauses (acknowledgment or command use or none),
the dependent variable was the number of times each
strategy was used to control the pacing of the interface.
The total number of turns varied between subjects
because some subjects listened to each message only
once while others went through messages multiple
times. We therefore normalized the counts by dividing
the number of times each strategy was used by the num-
ber of turns where the subject had had an choice of strat-
egies. We considered the possibility that subjects who
completed the task in only one pass though the messages
might show a preference for a different strategy than
those who required multiple passes through the mes-
sages, thus creating a bias in the normalized statistic. A
preliminary analysis showed no significant difference, so
we did not consider this possibility further.
The determination as to whether a particular utter-
ance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was
based primarily on word choice and dialogue context;
this approach is consistent with definitions of acknowl-
edgment, e.g., (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997). Immedi-
ately following a system inform (presentation of a
segment of an E-mail message), the words “yes,” “sí,”
“uh-huh,” “ajá,” and “okay” or a repetition of part or all
of the system inform were considered acknowledgments.
Phrases such as “go on,” “continue,” “next,” “continuar,”
or “siguiente” following an inform were considered
commands. The interpretation was confirmed during the
post-experiment interview by questioning the subjects
about their word choice.Transcriptions and categoriza-
tions of the subject utterances were checked by a second
person for accuracy.
Some subjects (one in the Spanish-language condi-
tion and eight in the English-language condition) com-
bined acknowledgments and commands in a single
utterance, e.g., “okay, go on.” If an acknowledgment was
the first part of the phrase, then it was included in the
analysis as an acknowledgment and if a command was
the first part, then it was included as a command. Most
subjects did this only once (the single subject in the
Spanish-language condition and three of the eight in the
English-language condition), and one speaker (English)
produced as many as six combined-type responses.
A post-experiment interview was conducted to
determine each subject’s impression of the system. Sev-
eral of the questions were drawn from the PARADISE
model (Walker et al. 2000). The experimenter also
explained the true purpose of the experiment and
answered subjects’ questions. This interview was taped
and the experimenter took notes. Data from subjects who
had realized that they were interacting with a human
instead of a completely-automated system were
excluded from the study because of the well-verified ten-
dency for people to speak differently when they believe
that they are speaking with a human instead of a com-
puter (e.g., Brennan, 1991).

3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959442307693">
We hypothesized that subjects would use acknowl-
edgment behaviors to control the recorded-voice version
of the interface than they did with the synthesized-voice
version. We expected this increase to be seen in both
Spanish and English conditions and across both female
and male speakers. The results were contrary to our
expectations.
When interacting with the recorded-voice interface,
commands and acknowledgments were preferred as a
strategy by 15% and 17.5%, respectively, of all subjects.
This result was not significantly different than that seen
in the synthesized-voice study, as confirmed by the Wil-
coxen-Mann-Whitney test (z = -0.5041, p= 0.0139 for
commands, z = 1.686, p= 0.0465 for acknowledgments).
Contrary to our expectations, the numbers of sub-
jects using either acknowledgments and commands actu-
ally dropped. This was due to the fact that the numbers
of subjects who used waiting as their sole strategy rose
sharply, from 9 subjects in the synthesized-voice study
to 19 in the recorded-voice study ( χ2 = 14.34 , p&lt;0.001).
Forty percent of the subjects used a command at
least once, and 45% used an acknowledgement at least
once. Seven subjects seemed comfortable with both
commands and acknowledgments, using at least five
examples of each. When acknowledgments were used,
the most common word choice was “okay” (both lan-
guages). When commands were used, the most common
word choices were “go on” in English, and “continuar”
in Spanish.
We found no significant difference between the
recorded and synthesized-voice conditions when com-
paring male and female speakers nor when comparing
English and Spanish speakers.
Politeness behaviors were common. These included
the use of the phrases “thank you” or “gracias” and
“please” or “por favor” as well as a responding “good-
bye” or “adiós” to the system. Many subjects (7 Spanish-
language and 8 English-language, 37.5% total) used a
politeness behavior at least once and a few subjects (1
Spanish-language and 5 English-language, 15% total)
used them more than once. One English-speaking female
used politeness behaviors with almost half of her interac-
tions with the system. One subject, when asked in the
post-experiment interview why he chose to use this
behavior, responded “I don’t know, it’s just habit I
guess.” Three other subjects made similar statements.
We believe, and some subjects confirmed, that some
subjects in the recorded version assumed that they were
listening to recordings similar to voice-mail messages on
their telephones. They believed that the pauses were part
of the message and so did not realize that the system was
awaiting their response.

<bodyText confidence="0.999961529411765">
We compared subjects’ use of various strategies for con-
trolling the pacing of information presentation in a sim-
ple spoken-language interface using synthetic speech
with one using recorded speech. We had hypothesized
that subjects would offer more acknowledgments in the
recorded-voice condition. In fact, we saw no differences
in the numbers of subjects using acknowledgment as a
preferred strategy. We also saw a significant increase in
the number of subjects who made no attempt to control
the pacing of information presentation at all. We con-
clude that, in this case, use of a human voice in the inter-
face misled subjects into assuming a more limited
capability based on their previous experience with exist-
ing technology. In future work, we plan to move to a
richer domain that will support a more complex interac-
tion, one in which the system will have more opportuni-
ties to signal its interactive capabilities to the user.

We considered the possibility that subjects who completed the task in only one pass though the messages might show a preference for a different strategy than those who required multiple passes through the messages, thus creating a bias in the normalized statistic. A preliminary analysis showed no significant difference, so we did not consider this possibility further. The determination as to whether a particular utterance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was based primarily on word choice and dialogue context; this approach is consistent with definitions of acknowledgment, e.g., (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997). Immediately following a system inform (presentation of a segment of an E-mail message), the words “yes,” “sí,” “uh-huh,” “ajá,” and “okay” or a repetition of part or all of the system inform were considered acknowledgments. Phrases such as “go on,” “continue,” “next,” “continuar,” or “siguiente” following an inform were considered commands. The interpretation was confirmed during the post-experiment interview by questioning the subjects about their word choice.Transcriptions and categorizations of the subject utterances were checked by a second person for accuracy.

In post-experiment interviews conducted as part of that study, 50% of the subjects (11 in the English-language condition, 9 in the Spanish) had thought that they might be more likely to use acknowledgments if the interface had a more human-like voice. In this study, we tested that hypothesis: we examined the effect of changing the interface prompts from synthesized speech to recorded speech. The term “acknowledgment” is from Clark and Schaefer (1989), who describe a hierarchy of methods by which one conversant may signal that another’s contribution has been understood well enough to allow the conversation to proceed. Acknowledgments often appear in English as “uh-huh” and in Spanish as “ajá.” Acknowledgments, also called “back-channels” by some researchers (e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997), are one of several meta-dialogue behaviors that people use to control the flow of conversation.

Most subjects did this only once (the single subject in the Spanish-language condition and three of the eight in the English-language condition), and one speaker (English) produced as many as six combined-type responses. A post-experiment interview was conducted to determine each subject’s impression of the system. Several of the questions were drawn from the PARADISE model (Walker et al. 2000). The experimenter also explained the true purpose of the experiment and answered subjects’ questions. This interview was taped and the experimenter took notes. Data from subjects who had realized that they were interacting with a human instead of a completely-automated system were excluded from the study because of the well-verified tendency for people to speak differently when they believe that they are speaking with a human instead of a computer (e.g., Brennan, 1991). 3 Results We hypothesized that subjects would use acknowledgment behaviors to control the recorded-voice version of the inte</context>

In many systems, the use of barge-in defeats the common interpretation of an acknowledgment: if the user speaks, the system quits speaking and begins interpreting the user utterance. If the user intended to signal that the system should continue, the effect is exactly the opposite of the one intended. Thus, current design practices both discourage and render meaningless the standard uses of acknowledgments. 2 Experiment The study design, described below, is identical to that used in our baseline study (Ward et al., 2003) except that the interface prompts and messages were delivered using recorded human voices instead of synthesized voice. These studies were conducted in both American English and Mexican Spanish. 2.1 Method We did not want to explicitly instruct or require subjects to use acknowledgment behavior, as that would tell us nothing about their preferences. Instead, we wanted to create a situation in which subjects would have a reason to use acknowledgments, perhaps even gain an advantage from doing so, while still keeping the behavior optional.
