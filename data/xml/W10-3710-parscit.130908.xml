Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99969695">
In linguistic studies, reduplication gener-
ally means the repetition of any linguis-
tic unit such as a phoneme, morpheme,
word, phrase, clause or the utterance as a
whole. The identification of reduplica-
tion is a part of general task of identifica-
tion of multiword expressions (MWE).
In the present work, reduplications have
been identified from the Bengali corpus
of the articles of Rabindranath Tagore.
The present rule-based approach is di-
vided into two phases. In the first phase,
identification of reduplications has been
done mainly at general expression level
and in the second phase, their structural
and semantics classifications are ana-
lyzed. The system has been evaluated
with average Precision, Recall and F-
Score values of 92.82%, 91.50% and
92.15% respectively.

<bodyText confidence="0.999769153846154">
In all languages, the repetition of noun, pronoun,
adjective and verb are broadly classified under
two coarse-grained categories: repetition at the
(a) expression level, and at the (b) contents or
semantic level. The repetition at both the levels
is mainly used for emphasis, generality, intensity
or to show continuation of an act. The paper
deals with the identification of reduplications at
both levels in Bengali. Reduplication phenome-
non is not an exotic feature of Indian Languages.
For instance, Yiddish English has duplication of
the form X schm-X, as in &amp;quot;duplication schmu-
plication&amp;quot;. Semantic duplication is also rich in

English and Onomatopoeic repetition is not un-
common either (e.g., ha-ha, blah-blah etc).
Reduplication carries various semantic mean-
ings and sometime helps to identify the mental
state of the speaker as well. Some correlative
words are used in Bengali to express the posses-
siveness, relative or descriptiveness. They are
called ‘secondary descriptive compounds’.
The related studies on MWEs are discussed in
Section 2. Various types of reduplications in
Bengali and their semantic interpretations are
discussed in Section 3. The proposed system
architecture and the procedures are discussed in
Section 4. The evaluation metrics used for eva-
luating the system are discussed in Section 5.
Experimental results are presented in Section 6
and conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

The works on MWE identification and extrac-
tion have been continuing in English (Fillmore,
2003; Sag et. al, 2002). After tokenization, mul-
tiword expressions are important in understand-
ing the meaning in applications like Machine
Translation, Information Retrieval system etc.
Some of the MWE extraction tasks in English
can be seen in (Diab and Bhutada, 2009; Enivre
and Nilson, 2004). Among Indian languages,
Hindi compound noun MWE extraction has been
studied in (Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008).
Manipuri reduplicated MWE identification is
discussed in (Nongmeikapam and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2010). There are no published works on
reduplicated MWE identification in Bengali.

Bengali Shallow Parser1 can only identify hy-
phened reduplication and gives them separate
tags like RDP (reduplication) or ECH (echo).
Another objective for identifying reduplicated
MWEs is to extract correct sense of reduplicated
MWEs as discussed in Section 3.2. Sometime,
reduplication is used for sentiment marking to
identify whether the speaker uses it in positive or
negative sense. For example,

3.1 Expression Level Classification of Redu-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997180034482759">
Four classes of reduplications commonly occur
in the Indian language (Bengali, Hindi, Tamil2,
Manipuri etc.). In Bengali, another type called
correlated word is also classified as reduplica-
tion.
Onomatopoeic expressions: Such words rep-
resent an imitation of a particular sound or imita-
tion of an action along with the sound, etc. For
example, khat khat, (knock knock).
Complete Reduplication: The individual
words carry certain meaning, and they are re-
peated. e.g. bara-bara (big big), dheere dheere,
slowly). In some cases, both the speaker and the
listener repeat certain clauses or phrases in long
utterances or narrations. The repetition of such
utterances breaks the monotony of the narration,
allows a pause for the listener to comprehend the
situation, and also provides an opportunity to the
speaker to change the style of narration.
Partial Reduplication: Only one of the
words is meaningful, while the second word is
constructed by partially reduplicating the first
word. Most common type in Bengali is one
where the first letter or the associated matra or
both is changed, e.g. thakur-thukur (God),
boka-soka ( Foolish) etc.
Semantic Reduplication: The most common
forms of semantic relations between paired
words are synonym (matha-mundu, head), an-

tonym (din-rat, day and night), class representa-
tive (cha-paani, snacks)).
Correlative Reduplication: To express a
sense of exchange or barter or interchange, the
style of corresponding correlative words is used
just preceding the main root verb. For example,
maramari( fighting).

4 System Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996708">
The system is designed in two phases. The first
phase identifies mainly five cases of reduplica-
tion discussed in Section 3.1 and the second
phase attempts to extract the associated sense or
semantics discussed in Section 3.2.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99054">
4.1 Identifying Reduplications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99968575">
Reduplication is considered as two consecutive
words W1 and W2. For complete reduplica-
tion, after removing matra, comparison for com-
plete equality of two words is checked.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996966">
74
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998304615384615">
In partial reduplication, three cases are pos-
sible- (i) change of the first vowel or the matra
attached with first consonant, (ii) change of con-
sonant itself in first position or (iii) change of
both matra and consonant. Exception is reported
where vowel in first position is changed to con-
sonant and its corresponding matra is added. For
example, ������� (abal-tabal, incoherent or
irrelevant). Linguistic study (Chattopadhyay,
1992) reveals that the consonants that can be
produced after changing are �, �, �, �.
For onomatopoeic expression, mainly words
are repeated twice and may be with some matra
(mainly ‘e-matra is added with the first word to
make second word). In this case, after removing
inflection, words are divided equally and then
the comparison is done.
For correlative reduplication, the formative
affixes � and -i are added with the root to
form w1 and w2 respectively and agglutinated
together to make a single word.
For semantic reduplication, a dictionary
based approach has been taken. List of inflec-
tions identified for the semantic reduplication is
shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Inflections identified for semantic redu-
plication.
This system has identified those consecutive
words having same part-of-speech. Then, mor-
phological analysis has been done to identify the
roots of both components. In synonymous redu-
plication, w2 is the synonym of w1. So, at first
in Bengali monolingual dictionary, the entry of
w1 is searched to have any existence of w2. For
antonym words, they are mainly gradable oppo-
site (pap-purna, Vice and Virtue) where the
word and its antonyms are entirely different
word forms. The productive opposites (garraji,
disagree is the opposite of raji, agree) are easy
to identify because the opposite word is gener-
ated by adding some fixed number of prefixes or
suffixes with the original. In dictionary based
approach, English meaning of both w1 and w2
are extracted and opposite of w1 is searched in
English WordNet3 for any entry of w2. The first
model for identifying the five types of reduplica-
tions is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Semantics (Sense) Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954235294118">
Mainly eight types of semantic classifications
are identified in Section 3.2. If the reduplication
is an onomatopoeic expression, its sense is easily
identified as the sense of onomatopoeia. When
infinite verb with complete reduplication is iden-
tified in a sentence, it obviously expresses the
sense of incompleteness. The semantic or partial
reduplicated words belong to the sense of com-
pletion. The correlative word is classified as the
sense of corresponding correlative word because
it is generally associated with the full verb in the
sentence. The problem arises when grouping the
complete reduplication. Sometime they are used
as sense of repetition, plurality and sometime
they express some kind of hesitation, incom-
pleteness or softness. Sense disambiguation for
this case has been identified as a future work.

The scores of partial and semantic evaluation
are not satisfactory because of some wrong tag-
ging by the shallow parser (adjective, adverb and
noun are mainly interchanged). Some synony-
mous reduplication (����-ii�­. , dhire-susthe,
slowly and steadily, leisurely) implies some
sense of the previous word but not its exact
synonym. These words are not identified prop-
erly. Figure 2 shows that the use of complete
reduplication is more in this corpus. In this cor-
pus, only 8.52% reduplications are hyphened. It
shows that the trend of writing reduplications is
to use the space as separator. Also the percent-
age of closed reduplications is 33.09% where
maximum of them are onomatopoeic, correlative
and semantic reduplications. 100% of correlative
reduplications are closed.

<bodyText confidence="0.999873125">
The reduplication phenomenon has been studied
for Bengali at the expression as well as at the
semantic levels. The semantics of the redupli-
cated words indicate some sort of sense disam-
biguation that cannot be handled by only rule-
based approach. More works need to be done for
identifying semantic reduplication using statisti-
cal and morphological approaches.

After tokenization, multiword expressions are important in understanding the meaning in applications like Machine Translation, Information Retrieval system etc. Some of the MWE extraction tasks in English can be seen in (Diab and Bhutada, 2009; Enivre and Nilson, 2004). Among Indian languages, Hindi compound noun MWE extraction has been studied in (Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008). Manipuri reduplicated MWE identification is discussed in (Nongmeikapam and Bandyopadhyay, 2010). There are no published works on reduplicated MWE identification in Bengali. 3 Reduplication of Words in Bengali Identification of MWEs is done during the tokenization phase and is absolutely necessary 73 Proceedings of the Multiword Expressions: From Theory to Applications (MWE 2010), pages 73–76, Beijing, August 2010 during POS tagging as is outlined in (Thoudam and Bandyopadhyay, 2008). POS tagger identifies MWE as unknown word at token level. Bengali Shallow Parser1 can only identify hyphened reduplication and gives them separate tags like RDP (reduplication) or ECH (echo).

POS tagger identifies MWE as unknown word at token level. Bengali Shallow Parser1 can only identify hyphened reduplication and gives them separate tags like RDP (reduplication) or ECH (echo). Another objective for identifying reduplicated MWEs is to extract correct sense of reduplicated MWEs as discussed in Section 3.2. Sometime, reduplication is used for sentiment marking to identify whether the speaker uses it in positive or negative sense. For example, (i) Eto Bara Bara Asha Kisher?(Why are you thinking so high?) (Positive Sense) (ii) Ki Bara Bara Bari Ekhane! (Here, the buildings are ver</context>
