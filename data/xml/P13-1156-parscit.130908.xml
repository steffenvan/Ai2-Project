<bodyText confidence="0.99969335">
Hiero translation models have two lim-
itations compared to phrase-based mod-
els: 1) Limited hypothesis space; 2) No
lexicalized reordering model. We pro-
pose an extension of Hiero called Phrasal-
Hiero to address Hiero’s second problem.
Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypoth-
esis space as the original Hiero but in-
corporates a phrase-based distance cost
feature and lexicalized reodering features
into the chart decoder. The work consists
of two parts: 1) for each Hiero transla-
tion derivation, find its corresponding dis-
continuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend
the chart decoder to incorporate features
from the phrase-based path. We achieve
significant improvement over both Hiero
and phrase-based baselines for Arabic-
English, Chinese-English and German-
English translation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999446">
Phrase-based and tree-based translation model are
the two main streams in state-of-the-art machine
translation. The tree-based translation model, by
using a synchronous context-free grammar for-
malism, can capture longer reordering between
source and target language. Yet, tree-based trans-
lation often underperforms phrase-based transla-
tion in language pairs with short range reordering
such as Arabic-English translation (Zollmann et
al., 2008; Birch et al., 2009).
We follow Koehn et al. (2003) for our phrase-
based system and Chiang (2005) for our Hiero sys-
tem. In both systems, the translation of a source
sentence f is the target sentence e* that maximizes
a linear combination of features and weights:

• a is a translation path of f. In the phrase-
based system, aph represents a segmentation
of e and f and a correspondance of phrases.
In the Hiero system, atr is a derivation of a
parallel parse tree of f and e, each nontermi-
nal representing a rule in the derivation.
• X (f) is the hypothesis space of the sentence
f. We denote Xph (f) as the phrase-based
hypothesis space of f and Xtr (f) as its tree-
based hypothesis space. Galley and Manning
(2010) point out that due to the hard con-
straints of rule combination, the tree-based
system does not have the same excessive hy-
pothesis space as the phrase-based system.
• M is the set of feature indexes used in the
decoder. Many features are shared between
phrase-based and tree-based systems includ-
ing language model, word count, and trans-
lation model features. Phrase-based systems
often use a lexical reordering model in addi-
tion to the distance cost feature.

<bodyText confidence="0.999936352941177">
The biggest difference in a Hiero system and a
phrase-based system is in how the reordering is
modeled. In the Hiero system, the reordering de-
cision is encoded in weighted translation rules, de-
termined by nonterminal mappings. For example,
the rule X → ne X1 pas ; not X1 : w indicates
the translation of the phrase between ne and pas to
be after the English word not with score w. During
decoding, the system parses the source sentence
and synchronously generates the target output.
To achieve reordering, the phrase-based sys-
tem translates source phrases out of order. A re-
ordering distance limit is imposed to avoid search
space explosion. Most phrase-based systems are
equipped with a distance reordering cost feature
to tune the system towards the right amount of
reordering, but then also a lexicalized reordering

model to model the direction of adjacent source
phrases reordering as either monotone, swap or

There are two reasons to explain the shortcom-
ings of the current Hiero system:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986142333333333">
1. A limited hypothesis space because the syn-
chronous context-free grammar is not appli-
cable to non-projective dependencies.
2. It does not have the expressive lexicalized re-
ordering model and distance cost features of
the phrase-based system.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999509906976744">
When comparing phrase-based and Hiero trans-
lation models, most of previous work on tree-
based translation addresses its limited hypothesis
space problem. Huck et al. (2012) add new rules
into the Hiero system, Carreras and Collins (2009)
apply the tree adjoining grammar formalism to al-
low highly flexible reordering. On the other hand,
the Hiero model has the advantage of capturing
long distance and structure reordering. Galley
and Manning (2010) extend phrase-based trans-
lation by allowing gaps within phrases such as
(ne ... pas, not), so the decoder still has the dis-
criminative reordering features of phrase-based,
but also uses on average longer phrases. How-
ever, these phrase pairs with gaps do not capture
structure reordering as do Hiero rules with non-
terminal mappings. For example, the rule X -+
ne X1 pas ; not X1 explicitly places the transla-
tion of the phrase between ne and pas behind the
English word not through nonterminal X1. This
is important for language pairs with strict reorder-
ing. In our Chinese-English experiment, the Hiero
system still outperforms the discontinuous phrase-
based system.
We address the second problem of the origi-
nal Hiero decoder by mapping Hiero translation
derivations to corresponding phrase-based paths,
which not only have the same output but also pre-
serve structure distortion of the Hiero translation.
We then include phrase-based features into the Hi-
ero decoder.
A phrase-based translation path is the sequence
of phrase-pairs, whose source sides cover the
source sentence and whose target sides generate
the target sentence from left to right. If we look at
the leaves of a Hiero derivation tree, the lexicals
also form a segmentation of the source and target
sentence, thus also form a discontinuous phrase-
based translation path. As an example, let us look
at the translation of the French sentence je ne parle
pas le franc¸aise into English i don’t speak french
in Figure 1. The Hiero decoder translates the sen-
tence using a derivation of three rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982816666666667">
• r1 = X -+ parle ; speak.
• r2 = X -+ ne X1 pas ; don&apos;t X1.
• r3 = X -+
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.446468">
Je X1 le Franc¸ais ; I X1 french.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989926923077">
From this Hiero derivation, we have a seg-
mentation of the sentence pairs into phrase
pairs according to the word alignments, as
shown on the left side of Figure 1. Or-
dering these phrase pairs according the word
sequence on the target side, shown on the
right side of Figure 1, we have a phrase-
based translation path consisting of four phrase
pairs: (je, i) , (ne ... pas, not) , (parle, speak) ,
(lefrancaise, french) that has the same output
as the Hiero system. Note that even though the
Hiero decoder uses a composition of three rules,
the corresponding phrase-based path consists of
four phrase pairs. We name this new variant of the
Hiero decoder, which uses phrase-based features,
Phrasal-Hiero.
Our Phrasal-Hiero addresses the shortcomming
of the original Hiero system by incorporating
phrase-based features. Let us revisit machine
translation’s loglinear model combination of fea-
tures in equation 1. We denote ph(a) as the corre-
sponding phrase-based path of a Hiero derivation
a, and MPh\H as the indexes of phrase-based fea-
tures currently not applicable to the Hiero decoder.
Our Phrasal-Hiero decoder seeks to find the trans-
lation, which optimizes:

We focus on improving the modelling of re-
ordering within Hiero and include discriminative
reordering features (Tillmann, 2004) and a dis-
tance cost feature, both of which are not modeled
in the original Hiero system. Chiang et al. (2008)
added structure distortion features into their de-
coder and showed improvements in their Chinese-
English experiment. To our knowledge, Phrasal-
Hiero is the first system, which directly integrates
phrase-based and Hiero features into one model.

Previous work has attempted to weaken the con-
text free assumption of the synchronous context
free grammar formalism, for example using syn-
tactic non-terminals (Zollmann and Venugopal,
2006). Our approach can be viewed as applying
soft context constraint to make the probability of
substituting a nonterminal by a subtree depending
on the corresponding phrase-based reordering fea-
tures.

Phrasal-Hiero maps a Hiero derivation into a dis-
continuous phrase-based translation path by the
following two steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.832570333333333">
1. Training: Represent each rule as a sequence
of phrase pairs and nonterminals.
2. Decoding: Use the rules’ sequences of
phrase pairs and nonterminals to find the
corresponding phrase-based path of a Hiero
derivation and calculate its feature scores.

2.1 Map Rule to A Sequence of Phrase Pairs
and Nonterminals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999209045454545">
We segment the rules’ lexical items into phrase
pairs. These phrase pairs will be part of the phrase-
based translation path in the decoding step. The
rules’ nonterminals are also preserved in the se-
quence, during the decoding they will be substi-
tuted by other rules’ phrase pairs. We now explain
how to map a rule to a sequence of phrase pairs
and nonterminals.
Let r = X →
s0X1s1 ... Xksk ; t0Xα(1)t1 ... Xα(k)tk be a rule
of k nonterminals, α(.) defines the sequence of
nonterminals on the target. si or ti , i = 0 ... k
are phrases between nonterminals, they can be
empty because nonterminals can be at the border
of the rule or two nonterminals are adjacent. For
example the rule X → ne X1 pas ; not X1
has k = 1, s0 = ne, s1 = pas, t0 = not, t1 is
an empty phrase because the target X1 is at the
rightmost position.
Phrasal-Hiero retains both nonterminals and
lexical alignments of Hiero rules instead of only
nonterminal mappings as in (Chiang, 2005). A

rule’s lexical alignment is the most frequent one
in the training data. We use the lexical alignments
of a rule to decide how source phrases and tar-
get phrases are connected. In the rule r, a source
phrase si is connected to a target phrase tip if at
least one word in si aligns to a target word in tip. In
the rule X → Je X1 le Franc¸ais ; I X1 french
extract from sentence pair in Figure 1, the phrase
le Franc¸ais connects to the phrase french because
the French word Franc¸ais aligns with the English
word french even though le is unaligned.
We then group the source phrases and target
phrases into phrase pairs such that only phrases
that are connected to each other are in the same
phrase pair. So phrase pairs still preserve the lexi-
cal dependency of the rule. Phrase pairs and non-
terminals are then ordered according to the target
side of the rule. Table 1 shows an example of rules,
alignments and their sequences of phrase pairs and
nonterminals on the last column.

There are Hiero rules in which one of its source
phrases or target phrases is not aligned. For exam-
ple in the rule r4 = X → je X1 le X2 ; i X1 X2
extracted from the sentence pair in Figure 2, the
phrase le is not aligned. In our Arabic-English
experiment, rules without nonaligned phrases ac-
count for only 48.54% of the total rules. We com-
pared the baseline Hiero translation from the full
set of rules and the translation from only rules
without nonaligned phrases. The later translation
is faster and Table 2 1 shows that it outperforms
the translation with the whole set of rules. We
therefore decided to not use rules with nonaligned
phrases in Phrasal-Hiero.
It is important to note that there are different
ways to use all the rules and map rules with un-
aligned phrases into a sequence of phrase pairs.

2.2 Training: Lexicalized Reordering Table
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999666068965517">
Phrasal-Hiero needs a phrase-based lexicalized re-
ordering table to calculate the features. The lexi-
calized reordering table could be from a discontin-
uous phrase-based system. To guarantee the lexi-
calized reordering table to cover all phrase pairs
of the rule table, we extract phrase-pairs and their
reordering directions during rule extraction.
Let (s, t) be a sentence pair in the training data
and r = X → s0X1s1 ... Xksk ; t0X1t1 ... Xktk
be a rule extracted from the sentence. The lex-
ical phrase pair corresponding to the rule r is
ph = (s0 ... s1 ... sk, t0 ... t1 ... tk), with non-
terminals are replaced by the gaps. Because the
nonterminal could be at the border of the rule, the
lexical phrase pair might have smaller coverage
than the rule. For example, the training sentence
pair in Figure 2 generates the rule r2 = X →
ne X1 pas ; don&apos;t X1 spanning (1... 3,1... 2)
but its lexical phrase pair (ne ... pas, not) only
spans (1... 3,1...1).
Also, two different rules can have the same
lexical phrase pairs. In Phrasal-Hiero, each lex-
ical phrase pair is only generated once for a
sentence. Look at the example of the train-
ing sentence pair in Figure 2, the rule X →
je ; I spanning (0 ...1, 0 ... 1) and the rule X →
je X1 ; I X1 spanning (0 ... 3,0 ... 2) are both
sharing the same lexical phrase pair (je, i) span-
ning (0 ...1, 0 ...1). But Phrasal-Hiero only gen-

erates (je, i) once for the sentence. Phrase pairs
are generated together with phrase-based reorder-
ing orientations to build lexicalized reordering ta-
ble.

Chiang (2007) applied bottom up chart parsing to
parse the source sentence and project on the tar-
get side for the best translation. Each chart cell
[X, i, j, r] indicates a subtree with rule r at the root
covers the translation of the i-th word upto the j-th
word of the source sentence. We extend the chart
parsing, mapping the subtree to the equivalent dis-
continuous phrase-based path and includes phrase-
based features to the log-linear model.
In Phrasal-Hiero, each chart cell [X, i, j, r] also
stores the first phrase pair and the last phrase pair
of the phrase-based translation path covered the i-
th to the j-th word of the source sentence. These
two phrase pairs are the back pointers to calcu-
late reordering features of later larger spans. Be-
cause the distance cost feature and phrase-based
discriminative reordering feature calculation are
both only required the source coverage of two ad-
jacent phrase pairs, we explain here the distance
cost calculation.
We will again use three rules r1, r2, r3 in Ta-
ble 1 and the translation je ne parle pas le franc¸ais
into I don’t speak French to present the technique.
Table 3 shows the distance cost calculation.
First, when the rule r has only terminals, the
rule’s sequence of phrase pairs and nonterminals
consists of only a phrase pair. No calculation is
needed, the first phrase pair and the last phrase
pair are the same. The chart cell X1 : 2 ... 2 in
Table 3 shows the translation with the rule r1 =
X -+ parle ; speak. The first phrase pair and the
last phrase pair point to the phrase (parle, speak)
spanning 2 ... 2 of the source sentence.
When the translation rule’s right hand side has
nonterminals, the nonterminals in the sequence
belong to smaller chart cells that we already found
phrase-based paths and calculated their features
before. The decoder then substitute these paths
into the rule’s sequence of phrase pairs and non-
terminals to form the complete path for the current
span.
We now demonstrate finding the phrase based
path and calculate distance cost of the chart
cell X2 spanning 1... 3. The next phrase pair
of (ne ... pas, don&apos;t) is the first phrase pair
of the chart cell X1 which is (parle, speak).
The distance cost of these two phrase pairs ac-
cording to discontinuous phrase-based model is
|2 − 3 − 1 |= 2. The distance cost of the
whole chart cell X2 also includes the cost of the
translation path covered by chart cell X1 which
is 0, therefore the distance cost for X2 is 2 +
dist(X1) = 2. We then update the first phrase
pair and the last phrase pair of cell X2. The first
phrase pair of X2 is (ne ... pas, don&apos;t), the last
phrase pair is also the last phrase pair of cell X1
which is (parle, speak).
Similarly, finding the phrase-based path and
calculate its distortion features in the chart cell
X3 include calculate the feature values for mov-
ing from the phrase pair (je,I) to the first
phrase pair of chart cell X2 and also from last
phrase pair of chart cell X2 to the phrase pair
(le franc¸aise, french).

Zollmann et al. (2008), i.e, that the Hiero baseline
system underperforms compared to the phrase-
based system with lexicalized phrase-based re-
ordering for Arabic-English in all test sets, on av-
erage by about 0.60 BLEU points (46.13 versus
46.73). This is because Arabic language has rel-
ative free reordering, but mostly short distance,
which is better captured by discriminative reorder-
ing features.
The next four rows in the second block of Ta-
ble 4 show Phrasal-Hiero results. The P.H. line is
the result of Hiero experiment on only a subset of
rules without nonaligned phrases. As mentioned
in section 2.1, Phrasal-Hiero only uses 48.54% of
the rules but achieves as good or even better per-
formance (on average 0.24 BLEU points better)
compared to the original Hiero system using the
full set of rules.

distance-based reordering feature (P.H+dist) to the
Arabic-English experiment but get significant im-
provements when adding the six features of the
lexicalized reordering (P.H+lex). Table 4 shows
that the P.H.+lex system gains on average 0.67
BLEU points (47.04 versus 46.37). Even though
the baseline Hiero underperforms phrase-based
system with lexicalized reordering(P.B+lex), the
P.H.+lex system already outperforms P.B+lex in
all test sets (on average 47.04 versus 46.73).
Adding both distance cost and lexicalized re-
ordering features (P.H.+dist+lex) performs the
best. On average P.H.+dist+lex improves 0.90
BLEU points over P.H. without new phrase-based
features and 1.14 BLEU score over the base-
line Hiero system. Note that Hiero rules already
have lexical context in the reordering, but adding
phrase-based lexicalized reordering features to the
system still gives us about as much improvement
as the phrase-based system gets from lexicalized
reordering features, here 1.07 BLEU points. And
our best Phrasal-Hiero significantly improves over
the best phrase-based baseline by 0.54 BLEU
points. This shows that the underperformance of
the Hiero system is due to its lack of lexicalized
reordering features rather than a limited hypothe-
sis space.

report the results of MT04, MT05 and MT08 un-

PH.+dist outperforms P.H. on all test sets. We
have better improvements when adding the six fea-
tures of the lexicalized reordering model: P.H.+lex
on average has 28.05 BLEU points, i.e. gains
0.84 over P.H.. The P.H.+lex system is even better
than the best Hiero baseline using the whole set of

We again get the best translation when adding
both the distance cost feature and the lexicalized
reordering features. The P.H+dist+lex has the best
score across all the test sets and on average gains
1.14 BLEU points over P.H. So adding phrase-

the same improvement as adding lexicalized re-

shows that a strong Chinese-English Hiero system
still benefits from phrase-based features. Further
more, the P.H+dist+lex also outperforms the Hi-

4.5 Impact of segment rules into phrase pairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99887504">
Phrasal Hiero is the first system using rules’ lexi-
cal alignments. If lexical alignments are not avail-
able, we can not divide the rules’ lexicals into
phrase pairs without losing their dependancies. An
alternative approach would be combining all lex-
icals of a rule into one phrase pair. We run an
addition experiment for this approach on Arabic-
English dataset. Table 7 shows the examples rules
and its new sequence of nonterminals and phrase
pairs. The rules r1 and r2 have the same se-
quences as in Table 1. Without segment rules into
phrase pairs, the rule r3 has only one phrase pair:
ph = (Je ... le Francaise ; I ... french) and
ph is repeated twice in r3’s sequence of phrase
pairs and nonterminals. The new experiment uses
the complete set of rules so the rule r4 is included.
According to the new sequence of phrase pairs
and nonterminals, during decoding the rule r3 has
discontinous translation directions on both from
phrase pair ph to the nonterminal X1 and from
X1 to ph. But using lexical alignment and divide
the rule into phrase pairs as in section 2.1 , the
sequence preserves the translation order of r3 as
two monotone translations from (je; I) to X1 and
from X1 to (le Francaise ; french).

Hiero. Using only rules without nonaligned
phrases can get the same performance with trans-
lation with full set of rules for Arabic-English and
German-English experiments but underperforms
for the Chinese-English system. We suggest the
difference might come from the linguistic diver-
gences of source and target languages.
Phrasal Hiero includes all lexical rules (rules
without nonterminal) therefore it still has the same
lexical coverage as the original Hiero system.
In the Arabic-English system, the Arabic is in
ATB format, therefore most English words should
have alignments in the ATB source, rules with
nonaligned phrases could be the results of bad
alignments or non-informative rules, therefore we
could have better performance by using a subset of
rules in Phrasal-Hiero.
As Chinese and English are highly divergent,
we expect many phrases in one language correctly
unaligned in the other language. So leaving out
the rules with nonaligned phrases could degrade
the system. Even though the current Phrasal-Hiero
with extra phrase-based features outperforms the
Hiero baseline, future work for Phrasal-Hiero will
focus on including all rules extracted from training
corpora.

We have presented a technique to combine phrase-
based features and tree-based features into one
model. Adding a distance cost feature, we only
get better translation for Chinese-English transla-

achieved the best result when adding both distance
cost and lexicalized reordering features. Phrasal-
Hiero currently uses only a subset of rules from

Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding discontinuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path.

The tree-based translation model, by using a synchronous context-free grammar formalism, can capture longer reordering between source and target language. Yet, tree-based translation often underperforms phrase-based translation in language pairs with short range reordering such as Arabic-English translation (Zollmann et al., 2008; Birch et al., 2009). We follow Koehn et al. (2003) for our phrasebased system and Chiang (2005) for our Hiero system. In both systems, the translation of a source sentence f is the target sentence e* that maximizes a linear combination of features and weights: 1: �e*, a*� = argmax λmhm (e, f, a) .

There are two reasons to explain the shortcomings of the current Hiero system: 1. A limited hypothesis space because the synchronous context-free grammar is not applicable to non-projective dependencies. 2. It does not have the expressive lexicalized reordering model and distance cost features of the phrase-based system. When comparing phrase-based and Hiero translation models, most of previous work on treebased translation addresses its limited hypothesis space problem. Huck et al. (2012) add new rules into the Hiero system, Carreras and Collins (2009) apply the tree adjoining grammar formalism to allow highly flexible reordering. On the other hand, the Hiero model has the advantage of capturing long distance and structure reordering. Galley and Manning (2010) extend phrase-based translation by allowing gaps within phrases such as (ne ... pas, not), so the decoder still has the discriminative reordering features of phrase-based, but also uses on average longer phrases. However, these phrase pairs with gaps do not capture structure reordering as do Hiero rules with nonterminal mappings. For example, the rule X -+ ne X1 pas ; not X1 explicitl</context>

The tree-based translation model, by using a synchronous context-free grammar formalism, can capture longer reordering between source and target language. Yet, tree-based translation often underperforms phrase-based translation in language pairs with short range reordering such as Arabic-English translation (Zollmann et al., 2008; Birch et al., 2009). We follow Koehn et al. (2003) for our phrasebased system and Chiang (2005) for our Hiero system. In both systems, the translation of a source sentence f is the target sentence e* that maximizes a linear combination of features and weights: 1: �e*, a*� = argmax λmhm (e, f, a) .

For example the rule X → ne X1 pas ; not X1 has k = 1, s0 = ne, s1 = pas, t0 = not, t1 is an empty phrase because the target X1 is at the rightmost position. Phrasal-Hiero retains both nonterminals and lexical alignments of Hiero rules instead of only nonterminal mappings as in (Chiang, 2005). A 1589 rule’s lexical alignment is the most frequent one in the training data. We use the lexical alignments of a rule to decide how source phrases and target phrases are connected. In the rule r, a source phrase si is connected to a target phrase tip if at least one word in si aligns to a target word in tip. In the rule X → Je X1 le Franc¸ais ; I X1 french extract from sentence pair in Figure 1, the phrase le Franc¸ais connects to the phrase french because the French word Franc¸ais aligns with the English word french even though le is unaligned.

In Phrasal-Hiero, each lexical phrase pair is only generated once for a sentence. Look at the example of the training sentence pair in Figure 2, the rule X → je ; I spanning (0 ...1, 0 ... 1) and the rule X → je X1 ; I X1 spanning (0 ... 3,0 ... 2) are both sharing the same lexical phrase pair (je, i) spanning (0 ...1, 0 ...1). But Phrasal-Hiero only gen1590 erates (je, i) once for the sentence. Phrase pairs are generated together with phrase-based reordering orientations to build lexicalized reordering table. 3 Decoding Chiang (2007) applied bottom up chart parsing to parse the source sentence and project on the target side for the best translation. Each chart cell [X, i, j, r] indicates a subtree with rule r at the root covers the translation of the i-th word upto the j-th word of the source sentence. We extend the chart parsing, mapping the subtree to the equivalent discontinuous phrase-based path and includes phrasebased features to the log-linear model.

We make the same observation as Zollmann et al. (2008), i.e, that the Hiero baseline system underperforms compared to the phrasebased system with lexicalized phrase-based reordering for Arabic-English in all test sets, on average by about 0.60 BLEU points (46.13 versus 46.73). This is because Arabic language has relative free reordering, but mostly short distance, which is better captured by discriminative reordering features. The next four rows in the second block of Table 4 show Phrasal-Hiero results. The P.H. line is the result of Hiero experiment on only a subset of rules without nonaligned phrases.

This shows that the underperformance of the Hiero system is due to its lack of lexicalized reordering features rather than a limited hypothesis space. 4.3 Chinese-English Results The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs, the English corpus is lower case. The language model is the trigram SRI language model built from Xinhua corpus of 180 millions words. We tuned the parameters on MT06 NIST test set of 1664 sentences and report the results of MT04, MT05 and MT08 unseen test sets. The results are in Table 5. We also make the same observation as Zollmann et al. (2008) on the baselines for ChineseEnglish translation. Even though the phrasebased system benefits from lexicalized reordering, PB+lex on average outperforms PB+nolex by 1.16 BLEU points (25.87 versus 27.03), it is the Hiero system that has the best baseline scores across all test sets, with and average of 27.70 BLEU points. Phrasal Hiero scores are given in the second block of Table 5. It uses 84.19% of the total training rules, but unlike the Arabic-English system, using a subset of the rules costs Phrasal-Hiero on all test sets and on average it loses 0.49 BLEU points (27.21 versus 27.70).
