Information Extraction (IE), defined as
the activity to extract structured knowl-
edge from unstructured text sources, of-
fers new opportunities for the exploitation
of biological information contained in the
vast amounts of scientific literature. But
while IE technology has received increas-
ing attention in the area of molecular bi-
ology, there have not been many exam-
ples of IE systems successfully deployed
in end-user applications. We describe
the development of PASTAWeb, a WWW-
based interface to the extraction output of
PASTA, an IE system that extracts protein
structure information from MEDLINE ab-
stracts. Key characteristics of PASTAWeb
are the seamless integration of the PASTA
extraction results (templates) with WWW-
based technology, the dynamic generation
of WWW content from ‘static’ data and
the fusion of information extracted from
multiple documents.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984536585366">
The rapidly growing volume of scientific literature,
a by-product of intensive research in molecular bi-
ology and bioinformatics, necessitates efficient and
effective information access to the published text
sources. Information retrieval (IR) techniques em-
ployed in WWW interfaces such as PubMed and
Entrez are very useful in browsing bibliographic
databases and in facilitating the linking between
protein or genome sequences and related refer-
ences. But the jobs of automatically locating and
extracting specific information within the texts re-
quire more specialised Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques and have been the object of work
in information extraction (IE) or text mining ((Cowie
and Lehnert, 1996)).
While current work on IE in biology has concen-
trated by and large on the refinement of IE tech-
niques and improving their accuracy, the incorpo-
ration of an IE system’s output into effective inter-
faces that genuinely assist the biological researcher
in his/her work is equally important, and has been
neglected to date. Of course improving IE tech-
niques, their accuracy and cross-domain portability
are important research objectives for language tech-
nology researchers. But given that the techniques
will remain imperfect for the foreseeable future, we
must also ask how biologists can benefit today from
the limited capabilities of existing IE technology.
In this paper we describe an approach to pro-
viding effective access to the results of the Protein
Active Site Template Acquisition (PASTA) system
(Humphreys et al., 2000; Demetriou et al., 2002),
an IE system that extracts information about amino
acid residues in protein structures and their roles in
protein active sites directly from the published lit-
erature. To experiment with a mechanism for de-
livering PASTA results to biologist end-users, we
have developed the PASTAWeb interface, a WWW-
based interface that offers search and browsing facil-
ities to the extracted protein structure information,
as well as to the original text sources (MEDLINE

abstracts). PASTAWeb provides transparent text ac-
cess and advanced navigation capabilities to enable
users to track and display the relevant information
from text to text. The PASTAWeb facilities enable
users to find answers to implicit questions such as
What are the important residues for trypsin? or Is
serine found in the active site of amylase? and to
track the flow of information for specific classes of
biological entities (residues, proteins, species) from
text to text.
Given the performance limitations of current IE
technology, it is to be expected that some of the ex-
tracted information may only be partially correct,
missing or spurious. The PASTAWeb interface com-
pensates for the loss of information by supporting
rapid, easy verification by scientists of the extracted
information against the source texts.

2 IE and its Application to Biomedical
Texts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808617647059">
Perhaps not surprisingly, the identification of
biomedical terms in scientific texts has proved to be
the easiest extraction task and has demonstrated ac-
ceptable levels of performance, not too far from the
best results achieved in the NE task in the MUC
competitions, despite differences between the do-
mains (i.e. names of persons, organisations etc. in
MUC vs. terms identifying proteins, genes, drugs
etc. in biomedical domains). The techniques used
for this task vary from rule-based methods (Fukuda
et al., 1998; Humphreys et al., 2000), to statistical
methods (Collier et al., 2000) and statistical-rule-
based hybrids (Proux et al., 1998).
More complex IE tasks involving the extraction
of relational information have also been addressed
by the bioinformatics community. These include
protein or gene interactions (Sekimizu et al., 1998;
Thomas et al., 2000; Pustejovsky et al., 2002),
relations between genes and drugs (Rindflesh et
al., 2000) and identification of metabolic pathways
(Humphreys et al., 2000). The range of techniques
used in these systems varies considerably, but in
most cases requires the application of more sophis-
ticated NLP methods including part-of-speech tag-
ging, phrasal or syntactic parsing and (for some sys-
tems) semantic analysis and discourse processing.
To date IE researchers working on biological texts
have concentrated on building or porting systems to
work in biological domains. This paper addresses
the issue of utilising the IE results, after describing,
in the next section, the underlying PASTA extraction
system – what it is designed to extract, how it works,
and how well it fares in blind evaluation using con-
ventional evaluation metrics.

3 The PASTA System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
The overall aim of the PASTA system is to extract
information about the roles of residues in protein
molecules, specifically to assist in identifying ac-
tive sites and binding sites. We do not describe the
system in great detail here, as this is described else-
where (Demetriou et al., 2002).

3.1 PASTA Extraction Tasks
3.1.1 Terminological Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978615384615">
A key component of PASTA, and of various other
IE systems operating in the biomedical domain is the
identification and classification of textual references
(terms) to key entity types in the domain. We have
identified 12 significant classes of technical terms
in the PASTA domain: protein, species, residue,
site, region, secondary structure, supersecondary
structure, quaternary structure, base, atom (ele-
ment), non-protein compound, interaction. Guide-
lines defining the scope of the term classes were
written, and an SGML-based markup scheme spec-
ified to allow instances of the term classes to be
tagged in texts1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.52591">
3.1.2 PASTA Template Filling Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944810810811">
The PASTA template conforms to the MUC tem-
plate specification and is object oriented. Slot fillers
are of three types: (1) string fill – a string excised
directly from the text (e.g. Pseudomonas cepa-
cia); (2) setfill – a normalised form selected from a
predefined set (e.g. the expressions Ser or serine
are mapped to SERINE, one of a set of normalised
forms that represent the 20 standard amino acids);
(3) pointer fill – a pointer to another template object,
used, e.g., for indicating relations between objects.
To meet the objectives of PASTA, three tem-
plate elements and two template relations were iden-
tified. The elements are RESIDUE, PROTEIN
and SPECIES; the two relations are IN PROTEIN,
holding between a residue and the protein in which
it occurs, and IN SPECIES, holding between a pro-
tein and the species in which it occurs.
An example of a template produced by PASTA
for a Medline abstract is shown in Figure 1, which
illustrates the three template element objects and
two template relation objects. As can be seen from
the figure, the &lt;RESIDUE&gt; template object con-
tains slots for the residue name and the residue
number in the sequence (NO). Secondary and qua-
ternary structural arrangements of the part of the
structure in which the residue is found are stored
in the SEC STRUCT and QUAT STRUCT slots re-
spectively. The SITE/FUNCTION slot is filled with
widely recognizable descriptions that indicate that
this residue is important for the structure’s activation
(e.g. active-site) or functional characteristics
(e.g. catalytic). The REGION slot is about
the more general geographical areas of the structure
(e.g. lid) in which this particular residue is found2.
The INTERACTION slot captures textual references
to hydrogen bonds, disulphide bonds or other types
of atomic contacts. At this point the only attributes

3.2 System Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998077">
The PASTA system has been adapted from an
IE system called LaSIE (Large Scale Information
Extraction), originally developed for participation in
the MUC competitions (Humphreys et al., 1998).
The PASTA system is a pipeline of processing com-
ponents that perform the following major tasks: text
preprocessing, terminological processing, syntactic
and semantic analysis, discourse interpretation, and
template extraction.
Text Preprocessing The text preprocessing phase
aims at low-level text processing tasks including the
analysis of the structure of the MEDLINE abstracts
in terms of separate sections (e.g. the title, au-
thor names, abstract etc.), tokenisation and sentence
boundary identification. With respect to tokenisa-
tion, tokens are identified at the subword level result-
ing in the splitting of biochemical compound terms
into their constituents which need to be matched
separately during the lexical lookup phase. For ex-
ample, the term Cys128 is split to the three-letter
residue abbreviation Cys and the numeral 128.
Terminological Processing The aim of the 3-
stage terminological processing phase is to identify
and correctly classify instances of the term classes
described above in section 3.1.1. During the mor-
phological analysis stage individual tokens are anal-
ysed to see if they contain interesting biochemical
affixes such as -ase or -in that indicate candidate
protein names respectively.
During the lexical lookup stage the previously to-
kenised terms are matched against terminological
lexicons which have been compiled from biologi-
cal databases such as CATHS and SCOP4 and have
been augmented with terms produced by corpus
processing techniques (Demetriou and Gaizauskas,
2000). Additional subcategorisation information is
provided for multi-token terms by splitting the terms
into their constituents and placing the constituents
into subclasses whose combination is determined by
grammar rules.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998402">
Finally, in a terminology parsing stage, a rule-
based parser is used to analyse the tokenisation in-
formation and the morphological and lexical proper-
ties of component terms and to combine them into a
single multi-token unit.
Syntactic and Semantic Processing Terms clas-
sified during the previous stages (proteins, species,
residues etc.) are passed to the syntactic process-
ing modules as non-decomposable noun phrases and
a part-of-speech tagger assigns syntactic labels to
the remaining text tokens. With the application of
phrasal grammar rules, the phrase structure of each
sentence is derived and this is used to build a seman-
tic representation via compositional semantic rules.
Discourse Processing During the discourse pro-
cessing stage, the semantic representation of each
sentence is added to a predefined domain model
which provides a conceptualisation of the knowl-
edge of the domain. The domain model consists of
a concept hierarchy (ontology) together with inheri-
table properties and inference rules for the concepts.
Instances of concepts are gradually added to the hi-
erarchy in order to construct a complete discourse
model of the input text.
Template Extraction A template writing module
scans the final discourse model for any instances that
are relevant to the template filling task, ensures that
it has all necessary information to generate a tem-
plate and fill its slots, and then formats and outputs
the templates.

3.3 Development and Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998247826087">
Following standard IE system development method-
ology, a corpus of texts relevant to the study of
protein structure was assembled. The corpus con-
sists of 1513 Medline abstracts from 20 major scien-
tific journals that publish new macromolecular struc-
tures. Of these abstracts, 113 were manually tagged
for the 12 term classes mentioned above and 55 had
associated templates filled manually. These anno-
tated data were divided into distinct training and test
sets.
The corpus and annotated data assisted in the re-
finement of the extraction task definitions, supported
system development and permitted final blind eval-
uation of the system. Detailed results of the evalu-
ation, for each term class, and for each slot in the
templates, can be found in Demetriou et al. (2002).
In Table 1 we present the summary totals for the de-
velopment corpus, the unseen final evaluation cor-
pus (Blind) and the human interannotator agreement
where one annotator is taken to be the gold standard
and the other scored against him/her. The evaluation
metrics are the well known measures of precision
and recall.

The PASTAWeb interfaces is aimed at providing
quick access and navigation facilities through the
database of the PASTA tagged texts and their asso-
ciated templates. PASTAWeb has borrowed ideas
from the interface component of the TRESTLE
system Gaizauskas et al. (2001) developed to sup-
port information workers in the pharmaceutical in-
dustry. Key characteristics of PASTAWeb are the
seamless integration between the PASTA IE results
and WWW-based browsing technology, the dynamic
generation of WWW pages from “static” content
and the fusion of information relating to proteins and
amino acid residues when found in different sources.

Initially, MEDLINE abstracts are fed through the
PASTA IE system which produces two kinds of out-
put: (i) texts annotated with SGML tags describing
term class information for protein, residues, species,
regions, and (ii) templates which are used as the
main stores of information about residues including
relational information between proteins and residues
and between proteins and species.
Once PASTA has run, a separate indexing process
creates three indices. The first associates with each
processed document the terminology tagged version
of the text and any templates extracted from the text.
The second is a relational table between each doc-
ument and each of the instances of the main term
classes (i.e. proteins, residues or species) mentioned
in the document. This index also points to the title
of the document, because the title can provide vital
clues about the content of the text.
The final index is used to assist the ‘fusion’ of
the information in templates generated from multi-
ple texts for the same protein. This index provides
information about those proteins for which there are
templates generated from multiple documents. Due
to variations in the expression of the same protein
name from text to text, the identification of suit-
able templates for fusion is not trivial. The prob-
lem of matching variant expressions of the same
term in different databases is a well known prob-
lem in bioinformatics. The current implementation
of the indexing addresses this problem using sim-
ple heuristic rules. Simply put, two templates are
considered suitable for fusion if the protein names
either match exactly (ignoring case sensitivity) or
they include the same “head term”. The applica-
bility of the heuristic for finding a “head term” is
limited to constituent terms ending in -ase or -in
(to exclude common words, such as “protein”, “do-
main” etc.). For example, the protein terms “scor-
pion toxin”, “diphtheria toxin” and “toxins” would
match with each other because they all include the
head term “toxin”. Consequently, the corresponding
template information about the residues occurring in
these proteins would be merged into a single table,
though information about which slot fillers belong
to which term variant is retained.
The decision to do the matching of variant names
at the index level and not at the interface level is
simply due to operational issues. Matching the pro-
tein names from multiple texts involves the pair-
wise string comparisons between all proteins in the
PASTA templates. The number of these compar-
isons increases very rapidly as new texts and tem-
plates are added to the database and it was found
that is causes considerable delay to the operation of
the PASTAWeb interface.
Since information seeking tasks of molecular bi-
ologists may require complex navigation capabil-
ities, the storing of the results in “static” HTML
pages would have been unsuitable both practically
(more difficult to implement pointers between dif-
ferent pieces of information and to alter and main-
tain pages) and economically (requires more disk
space). We therefore opted for a dynamic page cre-
ator that is triggered by the users’ requests expressed
as choices over hypertext links. The dynamic page
creator compiles the information from the indices
and the associated databases (texts and templates)
and sends the results to the WWW browser via a
Web server. In the dynamically created pages, each
hypertext link encodes the current frame, the infor-
mation to be displayed when the link is selected,
and the frame in which this information is to be dis-
played. For example, the hypertext link for a title
of a document encodes information about the docu-
ment id of the document as well as about the target
frame in which the text will be displayed. Click-
ing on this link expresses a request to PASTAWeb
for displaying that particular text in the target frame.
The whole operation of PASTAWeb loosely resem-
bles the operation of a finite-state automaton.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992309">
4.2 Interface Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989314285714">
PASTAWeb offers a number of ways of access-
ing the protein structure information extracted by
PASTA. As shown in Fig 3 the interface layout can
be split into four main areas (frames). On the left
side of the page we find the “Access Frame” which
allows the user to select amongst text access options.
These options include browsing the contents of the
text databases via either the protein, the residue or
the species indices or via a text search option over
these indexed terms.
The right hand side of the screen is split into
three frames. The top frame, so called “Header
Frame”(see Fig 3), is used to generate an alphabeti-
cal index for protein or species names whenever the
user has chosen the protein or species access modes
for navigation. For residues, rather than an alphabet-
ical index, a list of residue names is displayed in the
“Header Frame”. This is because while the number
of protein names and their variants is probably inde-
terminable, the number of residues remains constant
(i.e the 20 standard amino acids).
Just below the “Header Frame” is the “Document
Index Frame” which initially serves to display the
automatically generated indices together with docu-
ment information. The “Index Frame” is split into
two columns, the left of which is used to present an
alphabetically sorted list of the chosen type of index
(i.e. protein, residue, species). The right column
occupies more space because it displays the list of
corresponding document titles (as extracted by the
PASTA IE system). These titles are presented as
clickable hyperlinks to the full texts each of which
can be displayed in the “Tagged Text Frame” below.
A second use of the “Index Frame” is for display-
ing template results, explained in more detail below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995754">
4.3 Term Access to Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940178571429">
A typical interaction session with PASTAWeb re-
quires the user to select one of the three term cate-
gories in the “Access Frame”, i.e. proteins, residues
or species. The “Header Frame” then displays a list
of alphabetical indices (for proteins and species) or
a list of residue names. Selecting any of these in-
dices, e.g. “M” for proteins, activates the dynamic
generation of a list of protein terms that are indexed
by “M” (on the left) of the “Index Frame” and their
corresponding document titles (on the right). Differ-
ent font colours are used to distinguish between the
two different kinds of information.
The selection of any of the title links causes the
system to dynamically transform the PASTA-tagged
text from SGML to HTML and display it in the bot-
tom “Tagged Text Frame” with the recognised term
types highlighted in different colours. The colour in-
dex for the term categories can be viewed in a frame
just below the “Access Frame” (the “Colour Index
Frame”). Each tagged protein, species or residue
term is itself a hyperlink which can be used to dy-
namically fetch the indices of the texts in which this
term occurs and display them in the “Index Frame”.
Using this functionality, the user can navigate
through a succession of texts following a single term
or at any point branching off this chain by select-
ing another term and following its occurrences in the
text collection.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.967975">
4.4 Web-based Access to Templates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990418604651">
Unfortunately, although the type of object-oriented
template produced by PASTA (Fig 1) is an efficient
data structure for storing complex information, it is
not suitable for displaying to end-users. For this
reason, the templates are dynamically converted to
a format that can be readily accommodated to the
screen’s layout while being at the same time eas-
ily accessible. The format chosen for displaying the
PASTA templates is tabular and is implemented as
an HTML table (see background picture in Fig 3).
Access to the templates produced by PASTA is
facilitated by special template “icons” or “flags”
which are displayed next to text titles or protein
terms in the “Index Frame”.
When a “single” template icon is displayed to the
right of a title, this serves to flag that a template for
this text is available and can be accessed by click-
ing on the icon. On the other hand, when a “double”
template icon is displayed next to a protein name in
the left column of the “index frame”, this indicates
that there are multiple templates (i.e. templates ex-
tracted from different texts) for this protein. Click-
ing on either of these icons will trigger PASTAWeb
to scan the corresponding object-oriented templates,
analyse their structures and convert them into tab-
ular format. In the case of fused templates the in-
formation is assimilated into a single template. The
template information is then displayed in the “Index
Frame” together a hyperlink to the title of the origi-
nal text which, when selected, displays the (tagged)
text in the “Tagged Text Frame”. This enables the
user to retrieve more detailed information from the
text if needed, or to inspect and verify the correct-
ness of the extracted information.
PASTAWeb offers a simple and easy to use mech-
anism for the tracking of information for a specific
entity from text to text, but can also assist in the
linking of information between different entities in
multiple documents. Starting with a specific pro-
tein in mind for example, a molecular biologist may
want to investigate structural similarities between
that and other proteins with respect to what has been
described in the literature.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991017948718">
We have described PASTAWeb, a prototype Web-
based interface to the IE results of the PASTA sys-
tem. Scientists in the area of molecular biology can
benefit from the novel navigation and information
tracking capabilities of PASTAWeb and use it as a
tool for fast access to specialised information.
At the time of writing, the database of processed
texts accessible through PASTAWeb is rather small
(975 texts in total). The rate at which new articles
appear on MEDLINE and the limited resources de-
voted to PASTA make it prohibitive to develop and
maintain for PASTAWeb a text database of size com-
parable to MEDLINE. Nevertheless, PASTAWeb of-
fers the core technology for the development of a
fully automated IE system whose input can be based
on automated updates (“autoalerts”) from MED-
LINE without human intervention. Current work
concentrates on the development of such an auto-
mated software component and on the feasibility of
expanding the system’s navigation capabilities to al-
low users to link together information provided by
PASTAWeb and by related servers such as the Pro-
tein Data Bank or SWISSPROT.
Finally, the utility of an interface such as
PASTAWeb can only be truly assessed by user evalu-
ation. Usability evaluation should be carried out us-
ing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qual-
itative evaluation should be used to review the users’
perceptions about the design, their preferred strate-
gies for accessing information and whether they find
the system easy to use and useful for performing
their tasks. Quantitative evaluation should focus on
measures of activity time, efficiency in tracking rele-
vant information and on analysing the effect “noise”

while this evaluation remains to be done, we believe
that the work presented here provides concrete, con-
structive ideas about how to effectively utilise the
output of IE systems in the biology domain.

<abstract confidence="0.999453782608696">Information Extraction (IE), defined as the activity to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text sources, offers new opportunities for the exploitation of biological information contained in the vast amounts of scientific literature. But while IE technology has received increasing attention in the area of molecular biology, there have not been many examples of IE systems successfully deployed in end-user applications. We describe the development of PASTAWeb, a WWWbased interface to the extraction output of PASTA, an IE system that extracts protein structure information from MEDLINE abstracts. Key characteristics of PASTAWeb are the seamless integration of the PASTA extraction results (templates) with WWWbased technology, the dynamic generation of WWW content from ‘static’ data and the fusion of information extracted from multiple documents.</abstract>

Information retrieval (IR) techniques employed in WWW interfaces such as PubMed and Entrez are very useful in browsing bibliographic databases and in facilitating the linking between protein or genome sequences and related references. But the jobs of automatically locating and extracting specific information within the texts require more specialised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and have been the object of work in information extraction (IE) or text mining ((Cowie and Lehnert, 1996)). While current work on IE in biology has concentrated by and large on the refinement of IE techniques and improving their accuracy, the incorporation of an IE system’s output into effective interfaces that genuinely assist the biological researcher in his/her work is equally important, and has been neglected to date.

We do not describe the system in great detail here, as this is described elsewhere (Demetriou et al., 2002). 3.1 PASTA Extraction Tasks 3.1.1 Terminological Tagging A key component of PASTA, and of various other IE systems operating in the biomedical domain is the identification and classification of textual references (terms) to key entity types in the domain. We have identified 12 significant classes of technical terms in the PASTA domain: protein, species, residue, site, region, secondary structure, supersecondary structure, quaternary structure, base, atom (element), non-protein compound, interaction.

Of these abstracts, 113 were manually tagged for the 12 term classes mentioned above and 55 had associated templates filled manually.

The corpus and annotated data assisted in the refinement of the extraction task definitions, supported system development and permitted final blind evaluation of the system.

More complex IE tasks involving the extraction of relational information have also been addressed by the bioinformatics community. These include protein or gene interactions (Sekimizu et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2000; Pustejovsky et al., 2002), relations between genes and drugs (Rindflesh et al., 2000) and identification of metabolic pathways (Humphreys et al., 2000). The range of techniques used in these systems varies considerably, but in most cases requires the application of more sophisticated NLP methods including part-of-speech tagging, phrasal or syntactic parsing and (for some systems) semantic analysis and discourse processing. To date IE researchers working on biological texts have concentrated on building or porting systems to work in biological domains.
