(Meyers et al., 2004b; Meyers et al., 2004a), a
project with the goal of annotating all nomi-
nal argument structure in the Penn Treebank II
corpus. The phenomena we cover include the
following (among others):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99165025">
• Support verb constructions like IB114s gave
MaryA a promotion; They&apos; took a walk;
and SheA had a visit.
• PP constructions exemplified by At Mary&apos;s
request, John performed the operationA .
and With Jo&apos;s help, FloA discovered oilA.
• Nominal constructions such as hisA share
of the blame and a topicA of discussion.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866982142857">
We also discuss how all these phenomena in-
teract and sometimes form what we call support
chains. For example, we can provide an expla-
nation of how they is linked to the subject po-
sition of debate in the sentence They&apos; had lots
of internal debate about this one. It turns out
that the argument sharing aspects of the nomi-
nal phenomena we describe here is very similar
to that of verbal phenomena which have been
more throughly studied. Thus our example of a
support chain is similar to subject equi (control)
and subject raising examples like They seemed
to want to debate, and our PP example with
request is a lot like sentences with parentheti-
cal verbs, e.g., John, Mary thought, could per-
form the operation really well. In both cases,
the modifier of the sentence includes the sen-
tence as an argument.
In this paper, we describe types and subtypes
of the various constructions that allow noun ar-
guments to occur outside the NP. In the pro-
cess, issues of of &amp;quot;idiomaticity&amp;quot; arise. The phe-
nomena discussed are typically licensed idiosyn-
cratically by two or more words (an MWE).
However, this is a tendency rather than a rule.
For example, support verbs straddle the line be-
tween idioms and non-idioms (Sag et al., 2002).
While keep tabs on and make sense really
do seem to be idiomatic, some support verbs
are quite productive, e.g., attempt can com-
bine with many nouns that describe or imply
actions, e.g., Hes attempted + an attack/an
experiment/.... Cases like give a standing
ovation are decomposable — clearly something
is being given, even though ovation is arguably
the main predicate. Even cases like take a walk
and make an attack should be viewed as MWEs,
given that the light verbs take and make co-
occur with only certain nouns — hence the ill-
formedness of *make a walk and *take an at-
tack. Thus the words and phrases that are the
subject of this study range from non-MWEs to
true MWEs and include many that are difficult
to determine whether or not they should be con-
sidered MWEs. It is our view that phenomena
are defined by their edges and not their mid-
dle and an understanding of the phenomenon
discussed will help create better definitions and
classifications of MWEs.
In the NomBank project, we annotate the
argument structure of nouns, including these
NP-external arguments. Creating specifications
that are as unambiguous as possible would en-
sure that annotators record these phenomena
consistently. This goal motivated us to make
many of the definitions that we provide below.

2 Support Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996841272727273">
We define a support verb as a verb which takes
at least two arguments NP1 and XP2 such
that XP2 is an argument of the head of NP1.
For example, in Johns took a walk, a sup-
port verb (took) shares one of its arguments
(John) with the head of its other argument
(walk). A support verb can either be seman-
tically empty, e.g., Johns made a proposal to
Mary or have content, e.g., Apples attempted a
takeover of Sun Microsystems.2 The seman-
tically empty support verbs, also called &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;
verbs (Wierzbicka, 1982), are similar to subject
to subject raising verbs like seem in John seemed
to leave. In contrast, what we call the equi vari-
ety of support verbs are more like equi verbs
(also called control verbs) like want in John
wants to leave. In fact attempt can function
either as an equi verb or as equi support verb,
e.g., in both John attempted to attack and Johns
attempted an attack, attempt shares its sub-
ject with attack. In all cases of support verbs,
an argument is shared between a higher predi-
cate P1 and a lower predicate P2, such that the
phrase headed by P2 is an argument of P1. For
light support verbs, P1 carries modality, tense
and other features, but is otherwise semanti-
cally empty — in particular the relation between
the upper predicate and the shared argument
is merely a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; relation, rather than a se-
mantic one. In contrast, the equi-like support
verbs assign a semantic role to the shared ar-
gument. Thus in the light support construc-
tion Johns made an attack, John is just the

port verbs that requires them to be semantically empty.

ATTACKER, whereas in the equi support con-
struction Johns attempted an attack, John is
both the ATTEMPTER and the ATTACKER.
The meaning and argument selection of a
predicate nominal are often similar whether or
not it occurs with a support verb. Neverthe-
less there are three important ways that sup-
port verbs and nouns interact. First of all,
many support-verb/noun combinations qualify
as MWEs. In general, only certain support-
verb/noun combinations are possible, e.g., give
a kiss, but not *make a kiss. Also, like idioms,
some support-verb-plus-noun combinations al-
low aberrant syntax, e.g., make sense is fine
without a determiner, whereas sense in other
contexts requires one. Similarly, keep tabs
on is only well-formed with the plural form
of the noun tabs (compare She&apos; kept tabs on
Mary with the ill-formed: *She kept a tab on
Mary). These sort of limitations tend to oc-
cur in idioms. Some nouns do not occur out-
side the containing support construction, e.g.,
wreak havoc, suggesting that they are in fact
idioms. Secondly, different support verbs have
different argument sharing properties (Mel&apos;euk,
1988; Mel&apos;euk, 1996). For example, have a visit
is different from pay a visit because the subject
of have acts like the object of visit, but the sub-
ject of pay acts like the subject of visit. In JohnA
had a visit, someone visits John, whereas in
Johns paid a visit, John visits someone. Fi-
nally, arguments of a noun may have different
interpretations depending on whether or not it
occurs within a support construction. Some dif-
ferences include the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9951013125">
• Negation and Modality — Support may
change the implication as to whether or not
an event actually takes place. A compari-
son of the following pairs of examples illus-
trates this point.
— Mary&apos;s destruction of the ring vs.
Marys attempted the destruction of
the ring
— Fred&apos;s nomination of Mary vs.
MaryA refused Fred&apos;s nomination
• Degree of Agentivity — compare the shared
argument&apos;s (Mary&apos;s) level of participation
in the following phrases.
— Mary&apos;s attack on Fred
— Marys helped with the attack on Fred
— Marys planned an attack on Fred

<bodyText confidence="0.9982894">
In the first instance, Mary actually attacks;
in the second, she helps attack; and if the
attack even occurs in the third example,
her role may be that of a general, not a
soldier.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990843142857143">
• Changes in Other Arguments — compare
the extent of the destruction in the follow-
ing two examples. In the first case, the de-
struction is total, but not in the second.
— Mary&apos;s destruction of San Francisco
— Marys wrought destruction on San
Francisco
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999748791666667">
Similar difference can be observed in rais-
ing and equi constructions. For example, John
is the subject of attack in the following sen-
tences: John attacked, John seemed to attack,
John helped attack, John refused to attack. Nev-
ertheless other aspects of meaning differ in each
of these sentences, just as they do in the com-
parable support examples above.
Allowing for these various changes in mean-
ing may make our definition of SUPPORT seem
overly inclusive. However, we do not claim
that support includes every case in which one
can infer a connection between a noun phrase
and one of its missing arguments. Rather, we
require that the support relation be lexically
based. This means that the support relation
must either be licensed by the support verb,
e.g., attempt or by the combination of the sup-
port verb, the noun and optionally, a preposi-
tion, e.g., keep tabs on. This rules out cases
where a connection between a noun and one of
its arguments can be made by other means. For
example, in He did not want a rival to win the
prize, one might deduce that He is an argument
of rival. However, this connection is made by
means of &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot;, a discourse process akin
to coreference (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) — when
not explicit, the argument of rival typically oc-
curs nearby, just as the antecedent of he prob-
ably occurs nearby. Therefore rival is not part
of a support structure in that sentence. Simi-
larly, led is not a support verb in the sentence
Market conditions led to the cancellation of
the planned exchange. Here Market conditions
is not an argument of cancellation — this would
seem to violate a selection restriction since only
sentient beings can cancel things. That sen-
tence actually implies that Market conditions
set a series of events into motion which ulti-
mately caused the exchange to be canceled.
Support constructions vary with respect to
their degree of idiomaticity. Some support
verb noun combinations seem really idiosyn-
cratic, e.g., keep tabs on, make sense and wreak
havoc. Others are quite productive, e.g., at-
tempt and plan can occur with many different
actions. Others are somewhere in the middle,
e.g., take a walk and give a kiss. For some
of the idiomatic and semi-idiomatic cases, it is
not possible to cleanly make the equi/light dis-
tinction. For example, in Johns gave MaryA
a kiss and Johns gave themA a standing ova-
tion, it is clear that John is the KISSER and
the APPLAUDER, but it is unclear whether he
is a GIVER or not. It depends on how literally
you interpret the MWEs give a kiss and give a
standing ovation. For annotation purposes, we
do not draw this distinction as we are only inter-
ested in marking the argument structure of the
nouns. Thus whether or not a shared argument
is an &amp;quot;underlying&amp;quot; argument of the support verb
as well is of little importance.3 Nevertheless, we
note the distinction in order to provide annota-
tors with a fuller inventory of support construc-
tions. Knowing all the cases helps the annota-
tors find the support constructions even though
it is unnecessary to assign particular instances
to one case or the other. On a similar note,
our goal for annotation is to identify noun ar-
gument structure. It is not necessary for us to
draw the line between productive support items
and MWEs — we leave that to the user.

3Similarly, the relation between the predicate &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot;
and its argument John is the same in John tried to leave
and John seemed to leave. It is only when one marks the
higher predicates that a distinction is relevant.
Due to the generality of these constructions,
it seems unlikely that these are really cases of
support. Indeed it seems that cases of predi-
cation other than simple copular constructions
can link nouns and arguments in the same way.
The following includes examples of predication
in clefting, extraposition, and small clauses.
Therefore, we assume that these links are due
to predication, not support.

an argument or adjunct of N2 may precede the
PP inside of NP1. Below, we give the range
of such cases that we have observed during our
annotation effort. As we show later, the lower
predicate NP2 can also be in prenominal posi-

cases in this section.

The first two examples represent cases that
are much like support verbs. In fact these
nouns are nominalizations of the adjective re-
sponsible and the verb attempt which also have
support/equi properties. In addition, so-called
transparent nouns (batch, avenues) may act as
bridges between a nominal predicate and its ar-
gument. Also, some part-whole relations al-
low this sort of argument transmission as well —
the possessor of a stage of development is the
thing that is developing; if one has a share of
liability, then one is (partially) liable.
In the following two examples, partitive con-
structions (quantifier + of) interact with sup-
port verb constructions (make + decision and
receive + award) to link an argument to a noun
predicate. The quantifier plus of of the partitive
constructions are sometimes analyzed as MWEs
(complex quantifiers) .5

some = Partitive Quantifier, She = argu-

Our final examples contain two types of nouns
of an inside-out variety, the first of which we
call CRISSCROSS nouns and the second we call
ATTRIBUTE nouns:
• The victimA of an assassination
victim = Crisscross Noun, The victim = ar-
gument of assassination
• a subjectA of speculation
subject = Crisscross Noun, a subject = ar-
gument of speculation
• The bitternessM of the battle
Bitterness = Attribute Noun, Bitterness =
manner modifier of battle
• The possibilityNi of an attack
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96187444">
possibility = Attribute Noun, possibility =
epistemic modifier of attack
A crisscross noun is an argument of its argu-
ment, i.e., the argument structures crisscross.
5The combinations a lot of and lots of can be viewed
alternatively as: (i) complex quantifiers, (ii) instances
of the transparent noun lot or (iii) instances of partitives
with the quantifiers a /ot and lots. It is almost impossible
to choose between these alternatives. For our purposes,
the second two choices have the same consequence — /ot
and lots can be part of support chains.
For example, victim is an argument of assas-
sination in the victimA of an assassination.6
Attribute nouns behave similarly. An attribute
noun takes an argument X, such that the at-
tribute represents some property of X, e.g.,
height, weight, etc. However, for some attribute
nouns, there is an implication that X possesses
that attribute to some degree. When X is an
action, this implication may translate into an
adverbial relation. For example, the phrase The
possibility of an attack, can be used to quan-
tify the chances that an attack will occur. In
addition, it implies that the attack is possible
(an epistemic modification relation).

5 PP Constructions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968078510638298">
PPs consisting of particular prepositions plus
nouns allow the noun to take some or all of
the rest of the sentence as an argument, e.g.,
the preposition at in combination with request
allows the rest of the sentence to act like the
sentential argument of request in At Mary&apos;s
request, John performed the operationA. The
key factor to note here is that the combination
of the preposition and the noun allow the ar-
gument of the noun to occur outside the noun
phrase. Typically, only specific preposition plus
noun MWEs license these constructions. As
with other preposition plus noun MWEs, the
determiner is often omitted, e.g., at issue, for
enjoyment, without question.
We have observed at least three different vari-
eties of PP constructions that allow NP-external
arguments. First of all, there are preposition
plus noun combinations that license extraposi-
tion structures. As shown in the following ex-
amples, these structures occur in the following
three environments:
i. Clause-or-NP copula PP
ii. It copula PP Clause
iii. Subject-of-Infinitive copula PP to-infinitive
The COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1998)
class EXTRAP-P-NOUN-THAT-S identifies
6There seems to be an overlap between crisscross
nouns and argument nominalizations of support verbs.
The support construction receive a grant can be nomi-
nalized as grant recipients or recipients of grants. Here
recipients is an argument nominalization of receive, the
support verb, where an argument nominalizations refers
to an argument (in this case the subject) of the corre-
sponding verb. Grant is the crisscross noun argument of
recipient in grant recipient and recipients of a grant,
whereas (the incorporated argument of) recipient corre-
sponds to the subject of receive a grant.
members of this class of nouns along with the
associated preposition. This PP construction
seems to include a number of preposition ±
noun MWEs (of concern, at issue, at risk,
to X&apos;s advantage, etc.) that license this set of
complement structures. These PP units func-
tion similarly to adjectives that take extrapo-
sition complements, e.g., It is unfortunate that
the party is over. Some examples follow:7
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988192">
• What to do nextA is at issue [Clause-or-
NP copula PP]
• It was of concern that his fifth grade

[It copula PP Clause]
• Your experienceA may be of interest to the
class [Subject-of-Infinitive copula PP to-
infinitive]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991872">
The second variety of PPs are instances
of subject oriented adverbials. Adverbs like
willingly and accidentally in John accidentally
spilled the beans and Mary left the room will-
ingly; infinitival purpose clauses as in George
lowered taxes to please his father and the PP
expressions in the next set of examples have
something in common: in addition to modify-
ing the main clause (conveying manner or pur-
pose), they also take the subject of the sentence
as an argument. For example, in Mary left the
room willingly, Mary is willing. In the examples
below, we express the relation between the ad-
verbial and the subject in terms of the argument
taking properties of the prepositional object. In
these examples, the PP is bracketed. Thus they
is an argument of enjoyment; the jury is an argu-
ment of debate and she is an argument of mem-
ories. Of the PP constructions that we discuss
here, this is the only type which we are aware
of that arguably includes some non-MWEs. For
example, prepositions like after can apply with
a wide variety of action nouns (after the discus-
sion/argument/battle) using normal syntax
(the determiner is required for singular nouns).

ple) is part of the NP and therefore not an NP-external
argument.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854636363637">
Finally, we have observed that some PPs are
similar to a common variety of verbal paren-
thetical phrases, e.g., Mary, John assumed, was
a biped or The origin of swiss cheese, Mary
claims, is the island of Bomboolia. For verbs,
these phrases are typically offset by commas and
include a verb that takes a sentential comple-
ment. When the verbs occur in these paren-
thetical constructions, the sentential argument
is filled by the main clause.8 Similarly, each
of the examples below contain a PP (in brack-
ets) containing a noun N, such that N takes
the rest of the sentence as an argument. We
have observed that these PPs consist of: one
of a small set of prepositions (at, with, without,
and possibly a few others); and a noun that
takes a sentential complement. The particular
preposition/noun combinations allowed seem to
be idiosyncratic — with the help of the FBI and
at his request license this construction, but *at
the help of the FBI and *with his request do not.
Thus, these PPs seem to be limited to MWEs.

something intriguing is going on.
In most cases, the main clause is an argu-
ment of the noun, much like the verbal cases
mentioned above, e.g., The court hearing began
in early October is the sentential argument of
request above. However, the properties of the
prepositional object determine the nature of its
sentential complement and how these surface
in the parenthetical construction. In the sec-
ond example above, help takes two arguments:
a participant and an action. These two ar-
guments are realized respectively by the main
clause subject and main clause predicate (VP).
Finally, while not effecting argument structure
some prepositions effectively negate the propo-
sition. Thus, the main clause something intrigu-

argument of question; and the meaning of a logi-

6 Support Chains
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999709090909091">
The phenomena described above can interact to
form links in a chain. Consider the example: Its
provides a source of marketing help. Provide
is a support verb for help; source is a trans-
parent noun; and help is an equi support noun.
This entails that: (i) It is an argument of help
due to the interaction of the support construc-
tion and the transparent noun source; and (ii)
It is an argument of marketing (It helped market
something) due to the equi support noun help.
Further examples follow:

<listItem confidence="0.9917864">
• The Big Boards is considering a variety of
actions.
• TheyA took advantage of dozens of oppor-
tunities.
• Its provides a source of marketing help.
• Its makes only a handful of decisions.
• The studentss took part in the demon-
strations.
• SaabA is looking for a partners for finan-
cial cooperation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999700634146342">
We have observed a number of properties of
support chains including: (1) There can be at
most one verb in the support chain. This must
be the first item in the chain, the one that gov-
erns the shared argument in the surface struc-
ture of the sentence; (2) Partitive quantifiers
cannot be the first item in a support chain.
These contrast with similar transparent nouns
which can be, e.g., HisA source of marketing
help; (3) The shared argument can be a logi-
cal argument of more than one link in the sup-
port chain, where X is a &amp;quot;logical argument&amp;quot;
of Y means something like Y assigns a theta
role to X in many theories. For example, con-
sider TheyA took advantage of dozens of op-
portunities. They is an argument of both ad-
vantage and opportunities because in interpret-
ing this sentence it is important to note that
they achieved an advantage and that they are
taking opportunities. In contrast, there is no
similar relation between they and dozens and
one&apos;s interpretation of the predicate took, de-
pends on whether one views &amp;quot;take advantage&amp;quot;
as idiomatic (as described above) — assuming
that advantage is the main predicate and take
is a light verb, then one would claim that take
bears no logical relation with They; (4) Sup-
port chains can be idiomatic, e.g., to take part
in; (5) When a crisscross noun is part of a sup-
port chain, the crisscross noun itself must be
an argument of the lower predicate. For ex-
ample, partner is a crisscross noun in the ex-
ample above (SaabA is looking for a partners
for financial cooperation.) Here Saab and the
hypothetical partner are both arguments of the
lower predicate cooperation. This is possible be-
cause crisscross nouns often take an additional
argument which is shared by the lower predi-
cate. For example, in Mary&apos;ss assassination
victim, Mary is an argument of both assassina-
tion and victim.

cases of this that we have observed in our cor-
pus, the support verbs fill in different argument
slots of the same event, although in theory they
could introduce different events — A hypotheti-
cal instance would be something like, HeA suf-
fered the same humiliation that IA had expe-
rienced many years ago. Here, the noun humil-
iation refers to two distinct events.
The following sentence represents the more
typical case of multiple support verbs:
Fred&apos; charged EnronA with squandering its
assetsA in a complaint filed in federal courtA.
In our analysis, the sense of complaint that
refers to a legal action takes four arguments:
the claimant, the reason for the complaint, the
adjudicator (court of law), and the defendant.
The sentence above includes all four arguments.
There are two support verbs. The matrix verb
charged links complaint to three of the argu-
ments: Fred = the claimant, Enron = the de-
fendant and squandering its assets = the rea-
son. The remaining adjudicator argument (fed-
eral court) is linked to complaint by the support
verb filed which heads a reduced relative clause.

<bodyText confidence="0.999995064516129">
We have presented data which we believe is
crucial to an understanding of the argument
structure of nouns and certain MWEs that in-
clude argument-taking nouns. Specifically, we
have shown that there are certain lexical trig-
gers for linking arguments of nouns across var-
ious phrase boundaries. By using these lexical
triggers, we believe that many NLP applications
(Information Extraction, Question Answering,
etc.) will be able to detect noun arguments that
would be lost otherwise, thus improving results.
Our account is based on work in theoretical
syntax and NLP on support verbs and transpar-
ent nouns. To these phenomena, we add addi-
tional phenomena, particularly crisscross nouns
and our PP parenthetical constructions. To our
knowledge, ours is the first account that dis-
cusses how these phenomena interact to form
support chains. Argument sharing phenomena
in nouns turn out to be very similar to previ-
ously studied argument sharing phenomena in
verbs (raising, equi, parentheticals, etc.).
A final feature of this work is the place of the
nominal argument sharing phenomena we de-
scribe in work on MWEs. Many support verb
± noun combinations either qualify as bona fide
idioms or straddle the line between idioms and
non-idioms. Our hope is that a better under-
standing of the argument taking properties of
these structures will help with the argument
structure of idioms and MWEs more generally.

<abstract confidence="0.998518350993377">project with the goal of annotating all nominal argument structure in the Penn Treebank II corpus. The phenomena we cover include the following (among others): Support verb constructions like gave a took a had a PP constructions exemplified by Mary&apos;s performed the . Jo&apos;s discovered Nominal constructions such as share the of We also discuss how all these phenomena interact and sometimes form what we call support chains. For example, we can provide an explaof how linked to the subject poof the sentence had lots internal this one. turns out that the argument sharing aspects of the nominal phenomena we describe here is very similar to that of verbal phenomena which have been more throughly studied. Thus our example of a support chain is similar to subject equi (control) subject raising examples like seemed want to debate, our PP example with a lot like sentences with parenthetiverbs, e.g., Mary thought, could perthe operation really well. both cases, the modifier of the sentence includes the sentence as an argument. In this paper, we describe types and subtypes of the various constructions that allow noun arguments to occur outside the NP. In the process, issues of of &amp;quot;idiomaticity&amp;quot; arise. The phenomena discussed are typically licensed idiosyncratically by two or more words (an MWE). However, this is a tendency rather than a rule. For example, support verbs straddle the line between idioms and non-idioms (Sag et al., 2002). do seem to be idiomatic, some support verbs quite productive, e.g., combine with many nouns that describe or imply e.g., attempted + an like a standing decomposable — clearly something being given, even though arguably main predicate. Even cases like a walk an attack be viewed as MWEs, that the light verbs cooccur with only certain nouns — hence the illof a walk an atthe words and phrases that are the subject of this study range from non-MWEs to true MWEs and include many that are difficult to determine whether or not they should be considered MWEs. It is our view that phenomena are defined by their edges and not their middle and an understanding of the phenomenon discussed will help create better definitions and classifications of MWEs. In the NomBank project, we annotate the argument structure of nouns, including these NP-external arguments. Creating specifications that are as unambiguous as possible would ensure that annotators record these phenomena consistently. This goal motivated us to make many of the definitions that we provide below. 2 Support Verbs We define a support verb as a verb which takes least two arguments and such is an argument of the head of example, in took a supverb one of its arguments the head of its other argument support verb can either be semanempty, e.g., made a or have content, e.g., attempted a Sun The semantically empty support verbs, also called &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; verbs (Wierzbicka, 1982), are similar to subject subject raising verbs like seemed leave. contrast, what we call the equi variety of support verbs are more like equi verbs called control verbs) like to leave. fact function either as an equi verb or as equi support verb, in both attempted to attack an its subwith all cases of support verbs, an argument is shared between a higher predi- P1 and a lower predicate that the headed by an argument of For support verbs, carries modality, tense and other features, but is otherwise semantically empty — in particular the relation between the upper predicate and the shared argument is merely a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; relation, rather than a semantic one. In contrast, the equi-like support verbs assign a semantic role to the shared argument. Thus in the light support construcmade an is the researchers assume a narrow definition of support verbs that requires them to be semantically empty. ATTACKER, whereas in the equi support conattempted an both the ATTEMPTER and the ATTACKER. The meaning and argument selection of a predicate nominal are often similar whether or not it occurs with a support verb. Nevertheless there are three important ways that support verbs and nouns interact. First of all, many support-verb/noun combinations qualify as MWEs. In general, only certain supportcombinations are possible, e.g., not a kiss. like idioms, some support-verb-plus-noun combinations alaberrant syntax, e.g., fine a determiner, whereas other requires one. Similarly, only well-formed with the plural form the noun She&apos;kept the ill-formed: kept a tab on sort of limitations tend to occur in idioms. Some nouns do not occur outside the containing support construction, e.g., that they are in fact idioms. Secondly, different support verbs have different argument sharing properties (Mel&apos;euk, Mel&apos;euk, 1996). For example, a different from pay a the subject like the object of the subof pay acts like the subject of a visits John, whereas in paid a someone. Finally, arguments of a noun may have different interpretations depending on whether or not it occurs within a support construction. Some differences include the following: • Negation and Modality — Support may change the implication as to whether or not an event actually takes place. A comparison of the following pairs of examples illustrates this point. Mary&apos;s the ring vs. attempted the the ring Fred&apos;s Mary vs. refused Fred&apos;s • Degree of Agentivity — compare the shared of participation in the following phrases.</abstract>
<author confidence="0.617805">Mary&apos;s Fred</author>
<abstract confidence="0.993485072580646">helped with the Fred — planned an Fred In the first instance, Mary actually attacks; in the second, she helps attack; and if the attack even occurs in the third example, her role may be that of a general, not a soldier. • Changes in Other Arguments — compare the extent of the destruction in the following two examples. In the first case, the destruction is total, but not in the second. Mary&apos;s San Francisco — wrought San Francisco Similar difference can be observed in raisand equi constructions. For example, the subject of the following senattacked, John seemed to attack, helped attack, John refused to attack. Nevertheless other aspects of meaning differ in each of these sentences, just as they do in the comparable support examples above. Allowing for these various changes in meaning may make our definition of SUPPORT seem overly inclusive. However, we do not claim that support includes every case in which one can infer a connection between a noun phrase and one of its missing arguments. Rather, we require that the support relation be lexically based. This means that the support relation must either be licensed by the support verb, by the combination of the support verb, the noun and optionally, a preposie.g., rules out cases where a connection between a noun and one of its arguments can be made by other means. For in did not want a win the might deduce that an argument this connection is made by means of &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot;, a discourse process akin to coreference (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) — when explicit, the argument of ocnearby, just as the antecedent of proboccurs nearby. Therefore not part of a support structure in that sentence. Siminot a support verb in the sentence conditions led to the planned exchange. conditions not an argument of — would seem to violate a selection restriction since only sentient beings can cancel things. That sentence actually implies that Market conditions set a series of events into motion which ultimately caused the exchange to be canceled. Support constructions vary with respect to their degree of idiomaticity. Some support verb noun combinations seem really idiosyne.g., make are quite productive, e.g., atoccur with many different actions. Others are somewhere in the middle, a a some of the idiomatic and semi-idiomatic cases, it is not possible to cleanly make the equi/light dis- For example, in Johnsgave gave a standing ovais clear that the KISSER and the APPLAUDER, but it is unclear whether he is a GIVER or not. It depends on how literally interpret the MWEs a kiss a annotation purposes, we do not draw this distinction as we are only interested in marking the argument structure of the nouns. Thus whether or not a shared argument is an &amp;quot;underlying&amp;quot; argument of the support verb well is of little Nevertheless, we note the distinction in order to provide annotators with a fuller inventory of support constructions. Knowing all the cases helps the annotators find the support constructions even though it is unnecessary to assign particular instances to one case or the other. On a similar note, our goal for annotation is to identify noun argument structure. It is not necessary for us to draw the line between productive support items and MWEs — we leave that to the user. 3 Arguments across Copulas As shown in the following examples, prepositional and clausal arguments of nouns can usually occur in the environment: [NP copula XP] where XP is an argument of the head of NP. According to a literal interpretation of the above definition, these are instances of support. However, at best, they are trivial cases. The real over who will control the market. This about a middle-aged son who makes sure ... The that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 ... the relation between the predicate &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot; its argument the same in tried to leave seemed to leave. is only when one marks the higher predicates that a distinction is relevant. Due to the generality of these constructions, it seems unlikely that these are really cases of support. Indeed it seems that cases of predication other than simple copular constructions can link nouns and arguments in the same way. The following includes examples of predication in clefting, extraposition, and small clauses. Therefore, we assume that these links are due to predication, not support. It&apos;s a put too much power in hands of a single person. The real take place between center-stage players like Toshiba, Zenith now Compaq. He considers it a Fred. CLAUSE] 4 Partitives, Transparent Nouns, Crisscross Nouns, etc. There are a number of noun phrase constructions such that given the environment: . . . [PP [ ]]] an argument or adjunct of N2 may precede the inside of we give the range of such cases that we have observed during our annotation effort. As we show later, the lower also be in prenominal positions. For simplicity we will stick with the PP cases in this section. • Theirsresponsibility for hard = Noun, = arof • attempt at the = Noun, = • first batch of = Noun, = arguof • many avenues of = Noun, = arguof • first stage of = Part-Of noun, = of development&apos; Each company &apos;ss share of = Part-Of noun, company = of verb in an alternation. on the transitive frame, the complement. The first two examples represent cases that are much like support verbs. In fact these are nominalizations of the adjective rethe verb also have support/equi properties. In addition, so-called nouns avenues) act as bridges between a nominal predicate and its argument. Also, some part-whole relations allow this sort of argument transmission as well — possessor of a of the that is developing; if one has a one is (partially) In the following two examples, partitive con- (quantifier + with supverb constructions + + link an argument to a noun The quantifier plus the partitive constructions are sometimes analyzed as MWEs quantifiers) • She&apos;made some of the = Quantifier, = arguof The received many of the = Partitive Quantifier, film = of Our final examples contain two types of nouns of an inside-out variety, the first of which we call CRISSCROSS nouns and the second we call ATTRIBUTE nouns: The of an = Noun, victim = arof a of = Noun, subject = arof The bitternessMof the = Noun, = modifier of • ThepossibilityNiof an = Noun, = modifier of A crisscross noun is an argument of its argument, i.e., the argument structures crisscross. combinations a of of be viewed alternatively as: (i) complex quantifiers, (ii) instances of the transparent noun lot or (iii) instances of partitives the quantifiers a is almost impossible to choose between these alternatives. For our purposes, second two choices have the same consequence — be part of support chains. example, an argument of assasof an Attribute nouns behave similarly. An attribute takes an argument that the atrepresents some property of weight, However, for some attribute there is an implication that attribute to some degree. When an action, this implication may translate into an relation. For example, the phrase of an be used to quantify the chances that an attack will occur. In addition, it implies that the attack is possible (an epistemic modification relation). PPs consisting of particular prepositions plus nouns allow the noun to take some or all of the rest of the sentence as an argument, e.g., preposition combination with allows the rest of the sentence to act like the argument of Mary&apos;s performed the key factor to note here is that the combination of the preposition and the noun allow the argument of the noun to occur outside the noun phrase. Typically, only specific preposition plus noun MWEs license these constructions. As with other preposition plus noun MWEs, the is often omitted, e.g., We have observed at least three different varieties of PP constructions that allow NP-external arguments. First of all, there are preposition plus noun combinations that license extraposition structures. As shown in the following examples, these structures occur in the following three environments: i. Clause-or-NP copula PP ii. It copula PP Clause iii. Subject-of-Infinitive copula PP to-infinitive The COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1998) class EXTRAP-P-NOUN-THAT-S identifies seems to be an overlap between crisscross nouns and argument nominalizations of support verbs. support construction a be nomias recipients of an argument nominalization of support verb, where an argument nominalizations refers to an argument (in this case the subject) of the correverb. the crisscross noun argument of of a (the incorporated argument of) correto the subject of a members of this class of nouns along with the associated preposition. This PP construction seems to include a number of preposition ± MWEs X&apos;s that license this set of complement structures. These PP units function similarly to adjectives that take extrapocomplements, e.g., is unfortunate that party is over. examples What to do is at [Clause-or- NP copula PP] It was of his fifth grade releasedhis recordsto the [It copula PP Clause] • Yourmay be of the copula PP toinfinitive] The second variety of PPs are instances of subject oriented adverbials. Adverbs like accidentally the beans left the room willpurpose clauses as in taxes to please his father the PP expressions in the next set of examples have something in common: in addition to modifying the main clause (conveying manner or purpose), they also take the subject of the sentence an argument. For example, in left the willingly, Mary is willing. the examples below, we express the relation between the adverbial and the subject in terms of the argument taking properties of the prepositional object. In examples, the PP is bracketed. Thus an argument of the jury an arguof an argument of memthe PP constructions that we discuss here, this is the only type which we are aware of that arguably includes some non-MWEs.

They&apos; exercise [for [After much focused on the facts. • She&apos;would look back on this day [with fond memories]. that the that-clause (the second example) is part of the NP and therefore not an NP-external argument. Finally, we have observed that some PPs are similar to a common variety of verbal parenphrases, e.g., John assumed, was biped origin of swiss cheese, Mary is the island of Bomboolia. verbs, these phrases are typically offset by commas and include a verb that takes a sentential complement. When the verbs occur in these parenthetical constructions, the sentential argument filled by the main Similarly, each of the examples below contain a PP (in brackcontaining a noun that the rest of the sentence as an argument. We have observed that these PPs consist of: one a small set of prepositions with, without, and possibly a few others); and a noun that takes a sentential complement. The particular preposition/noun combinations allowed seem to idiosyncratic — the the FBI his this construction, but help of the FBI his request not. Thus, these PPs seem to be limited to MWEs. • Thecourt hearing began in early the Anthony Hazen] [With the the FBI], taped their . [Without intriguing is going In most cases, the main clause is an argument of the noun, much like the verbal cases above, e.g., court hearing began early October the sentential argument of However, the properties of the prepositional object determine the nature of its sentential complement and how these surface in the parenthetical construction. In the secexample above, two arguments: a participant and an action. These two arguments are realized respectively by the main clause subject and main clause predicate (VP). Finally, while not effecting argument structure some prepositions effectively negate the propo- Thus, the main clause intriguis going on the third example above is an of the meaning of a logical proposition derived from this predicate must be precise, the sentential argument is filled by the entire sentence, less the adverbial phrase itself.

If so, semantic interpretation would enter an endless loop. negation due to the preposition i.e., one might paraphrase the third sentence as One would not question that something intriguing is going on. 6 Support Chains The phenomena described above can interact to links in a chain. Consider the example: a source of help. a support verb for source a transnoun; and an equi support noun. entails that: (i) an argument of due to the interaction of the support construcand the transparent noun (ii) an argument of (It helped market to the equi support noun Further examples follow: The Big is considering a variety of actions. • took advantage of dozens of opportunities. Its provides a source of marketing • makes only a handful of The took part in the demonstrations. • is looking for for finan- We have observed a number of properties of support chains including: (1) There can be at most one verb in the support chain. This must be the first item in the chain, the one that governs the shared argument in the surface structure of the sentence; (2) Partitive quantifiers cannot be the first item in a support chain. These contrast with similar transparent nouns can be, e.g., HisAsource of marketing The shared argument can be a logical argument of more than one link in the supchain, where a &amp;quot;logical argument&amp;quot; of Y means something like Y assigns a theta to many theories. For example, contook advantage of dozens of opan argument of both adin interpreting this sentence it is important to note that an advantage and that taking opportunities. In contrast, there is no relation between interpretation of the predicate depends on whether one views &amp;quot;take advantage&amp;quot; as idiomatic (as described above) — assuming the main predicate and a light verb, then one would claim that no logical relation with Supchains can be idiomatic, e.g., take When a crisscross noun is part of a support chain, the crisscross noun itself must be an argument of the lower predicate. For exa crisscross noun in the exabove is looking for financial the both arguments of the predicate is possible because crisscross nouns often take an additional argument which is shared by the lower predi- For example, in assassination Mary an argument of both assassina- 7 Miscellaneous Interactions This section describes miscellaneous examples of other interactions among the phenomena described above. 7.1 PP constructions with transparent nouns The PP constructions discussed in section 5 can interact with transparent nouns.

This opens up the possibility that the same noun may co-occur with more than one support verb.

Specifically, we have shown that there are certain lexical triggers for linking arguments of nouns across various phrase boundaries. By using these lexical triggers, we believe that many NLP applications (Information Extraction, Question Answering, etc.) will be able to detect noun arguments that would be lost otherwise, thus improving results.

As with other preposition plus noun MWEs, the determiner is often omitted, e.g., at issue, for enjoyment, without question. We have observed at least three different varieties of PP constructions that allow NP-external arguments. First of all, there are preposition plus noun combinations that license extraposition structures. As shown in the following examples, these structures occur in the following three environments: i. Clause-or-NP copula PP ii. It copula PP Clause iii. Subject-of-Infinitive copula PP to-infinitive The COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1998) class EXTRAP-P-NOUN-THAT-S identifies 6There seems to be an overlap between crisscross nouns and argument nominalizations of support verbs. The support construction receive a grant can be nominalized as grant recipients or recipients of grants. Here recipients is an argument nominalization of receive, the support verb, where an argument nominalizations refers to an argument (in this case the subject) of the corresponding verb. Grant is the crisscross noun argument of recipient in grant recipient and recipients of a grant, whereas (the incorporated argument of) recipient corresponds to the sub</context>

Also, like idioms, some support-verb-plus-noun combinations allow aberrant syntax, e.g., make sense is fine without a determiner, whereas sense in other contexts requires one. Similarly, keep tabs on is only well-formed with the plural form of the noun tabs (compare She&apos; kept tabs on Mary with the ill-formed: *She kept a tab on Mary). These sort of limitations tend to occur in idioms. Some nouns do not occur outside the containing support construction, e.g., wreak havoc, suggesting that they are in fact idioms. Secondly, different support verbs have different argument sharing properties (Mel&apos;euk, 1988; Mel&apos;euk, 1996). For example, have a visit is different from pay a visit because the subject of have acts like the object of visit, but the subject of pay acts like the subject of visit. In JohnA had a visit, someone visits John, whereas in Johns paid a visit, John visits someone.

This means that the support relation must either be licensed by the support verb, e.g., attempt or by the combination of the support verb, the noun and optionally, a preposition, e.g., keep tabs on. This rules out cases where a connection between a noun and one of its arguments can be made by other means. For example, in He did not want a rival to win the prize, one might deduce that He is an argument of rival. However, this connection is made by means of &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot;, a discourse process akin to coreference (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) — when not explicit, the argument of rival typically occurs nearby, just as the antecedent of he probably occurs nearby. Therefore rival is not part of a support structure in that sentence. Similarly, led is not a support verb in the sentence Market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange. Here Market conditions is not an argument of cancellation — this would seem to violate a selection restriction since only sentient beings can cancel things. That sentence actually implies that Market conditions set a series of events into motion which ultimately caused the exchange to be </context>

In both cases, the modifier of the sentence includes the sentence as an argument. In this paper, we describe types and subtypes of the various constructions that allow noun arguments to occur outside the NP. In the process, issues of of &amp;quot;idiomaticity&amp;quot; arise. The phenomena discussed are typically licensed idiosyncratically by two or more words (an MWE). However, this is a tendency rather than a rule. For example, support verbs straddle the line between idioms and non-idioms (Sag et al., 2002). While keep tabs on and make sense really do seem to be idiomatic, some support verbs are quite productive, e.g., attempt can combine with many nouns that describe or imply actions, e.g., Hes attempted + an attack/an experiment/.... Cases like give a standing ovation are decomposable — clearly something is being given, even though ovation is arguably the main predicate. Even cases like take a walk and make an attack should be viewed as MWEs, given that the light verbs take and make cooccur with only certain nouns — hence the illformedness of *make a walk and *take an attack. Thus the words an</context>

This goal motivated us to make many of the definitions that we provide below. 2 Support Verbs We define a support verb as a verb which takes at least two arguments NP1 and XP2 such that XP2 is an argument of the head of NP1. For example, in Johns took a walk, a support verb (took) shares one of its arguments (John) with the head of its other argument (walk). A support verb can either be semantically empty, e.g., Johns made a proposal to Mary or have content, e.g., Apples attempted a takeover of Sun Microsystems.2 The semantically empty support verbs, also called &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; verbs (Wierzbicka, 1982), are similar to subject to subject raising verbs like seem in John seemed to leave. In contrast, what we call the equi variety of support verbs are more like equi verbs (also called control verbs) like want in John wants to leave. In fact attempt can function either as an equi verb or as equi support verb, e.g., in both John attempted to attack and Johns attempted an attack, attempt shares its subject with attack. In all cases of support verbs, an argument is shared between a higher predicate P1 and a lower predicate P2, such that the phrase headed by P2 is an argument of P1. For light suppor</context>
