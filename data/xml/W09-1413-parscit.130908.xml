Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999518083333333">
In this paper, we present BioEve a fully auto-
mated event extraction system for bio-medical
text. It first semantically classifies each sen-
tence to the class type of the event mentioned
in the sentence, and then using high coverage
hand-crafted rules, it extracts the participants
of that event. We participated in Task 1 of
BioNLP 2009 Shared task, and the final eval-
uation results are described here. Our exper-
imentation with different approaches to clas-
sify a sentence to bio-interaction classes are
also shared.

<bodyText confidence="0.999937333333333">
Human genome sequencing marked beginning of the
era of large-scale genomics and proteomics, which
in turn led to large amount of information. Lots
of that exists (or generated) as unstructured text of
published literature. The first step towards extract-
ing event information, in biomedical domain, is to
recognize the names of proteins (Fukuda et al.,
1998; Blaschke et al., 1999), genes, drugs and other
molecules. The next step is to recognize relation-
ship between such entities (Blaschke and Valen-
cia, 2002; Ono et al., 2001; Fundel et al., 2007)
and then to recognize the bio-molecular interaction
events with these entities as participants (Yakushiji
et al., 2001; Tateisi et al., 2004). The BIONLP’09
shared task involved recognition of bio-molecular
events, which appear in the GENIA corpus. We
mainly focused on task 1, which was detection of
an event and its participants.

BioEve architecture is shown in Figure 1. First
the biomedical abstracts are split into sentences,
before being sent to sentence level classifier. We
used N¨aive Bayes Classifier to classify sentences
into different event class types. Classification at
sentence level is a difficult task, as sentences have
lesser information as compared to the whole doc-
ument. To help event extraction module, each of
these sentences are then semantically labeled with
additional keywords. We created a dictionary-based

labeler, which included trigger words from train-
ing data, along with the corresponding event type.
These labeled sentences are parsed using a depen-
dency parser to identify argument-predicate
roles. For each event class type, we hand crafted
high coverage extraction rules, similar to Fundel et
al. (2007), to identity all event participants. For
BioNLP shared task, the event-participant output
was formatted to GENIA format.

2.1 Sentence Level Classification and Semantic
Labeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976666666667">
We used N¨aive Bayes Classifier from Weka 1 library
to classify sentences into different event class types.
Classification at sentence level is a difficult task, as
sentences have lesser information as compared to the
whole document. We tried different approaches for
classification: 1) N¨aive Bayes Classifier using bag-
of-words, 2) N¨aive Bayes Classifier using bag-of-
words and parts-of-speech tags and 3) SVM Classi-
fier for Weka library.
BioEve event extraction module depends on class
labels for extraction. To help with this task, we
needed to improve sentence labeling with correct
class type information. For this, we employed dic-
tionary based semantic class labeling by identifying
trigger (or interaction) words, which clearly indicate
presence of a particular event. We used ABNER 2
gene name recognizer to enrich the sentences with
gene mentions.
There have been cases in the training data where
the same trigger word is associated with more than
one event type. To resolve such cases, the trigger
words were mapped to the most likely event type
based on their occurrence count in the training data.
We labeled trigger words in each sentence with their
most likely event type. These tagged words served
as a starting point for the extraction of event par-
ticipants. This was done to speed-up the extraction
process, as event extraction module now only needs
to focus on the parts of the sentences related to these
tagged trigger words.

2.2 Event Extraction Using Dependency
Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988253581395349">
The sentences, after being class labeled and tagged,
are parsed using a dependency parser (Stanford
parser3) to identify argument-predicate
roles. Words in the sentence and the relationships
between these words form the dependency parse
tree of the sentence. For our system, we used
typed-dependency representation output format
from Stanford parser which is a simple tuple,
reln(gov, dep), where reln is the depen-
dency relation, gov is the governor word and dep
is the dependent word. Consider the following
example sentence:
We investigated whether PU.1 binds
and activates the M-CSF receptor
promoter.
After this sentence is class labeled and tagged:
We investigated whether
T7 binds/BINDING and
activates/POSITIVE REGULATION the
T8 promoter.
The tagged sentence is parsed to obtain dependency
relations as shown below:
nsubj(investigated-2, We-1)
complm(binds-5, whether-3)
nsubj(binds-5, T7-4)
ccomp(investigated-2, binds-5)
conj and(binds-5, activates-7)
det(promoter-10, the-8)
nn(promoter-10, T8-9)
dobj(binds-5, promoter-10)
This sentence mentions two separate events, bind-
ing and positive regulation. Let’s consider the ex-
tracting the event binding and its participants. Fig-
ure 2 shows the parse tree representation and the part
of the tree that needs to be identified for extracting
event binding.
For each event class type, we carefully hand
crafted rules, keeping theme of the event, number
of participants, and their interactions into consider-
ation. Table 1 lists these extraction rules. In an ex-
traction rule, T represents the occurrence of protein
in sentence. If multiple proteins are involved, then
subscripts, T,,,, are used to represent this. The rule

pendency relations and rule predicates are explained

and negative-regulation, it was below par. The rea-
son noticed (in training examples) was that, most
of the true example sentences of positive-regulation
or negative-regulation class type were mis-classified
as either phosphorylation or gene-expression. This
calls for further improvement of sentence classifier
accuracy. Experiments with different approaches
for sentence level classification are shown in Ta-
ble 3. Classifiers were trained on training data and
tested on development data. Interestingly, simple
N¨aive Bayes Classifier (NBC) (using just bag-of-
words (BOW)) showed better results (up to 10% bet-
ter) compared to other approaches, even SVM clas-
sifier.

In this paper, BioEve’s Task 1 evaluation results
were described, with additional results from differ-

sify a sentence to the event type. Event ex-
traction performed better for some categories, but
clearly needs re-compiling extraction rules for some.
Where as classification results showed simple N¨aive
Bayes Classifier performing better than other ap-
proaches.
