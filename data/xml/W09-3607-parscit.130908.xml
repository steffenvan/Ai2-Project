We introduce the ACL Anthology Net-
work (AAN), a manually curated net-
worked database of citations,
collaborations, and summaries in the field
of Computational Linguistics. We also
present a number of statistics about the
network including the most cited authors,
the most central collaborators, as well as
network statistics about the paper citation,
author citation, and author collaboration
networks.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849884615385">
The ACL Anthology is one of the most
successful initiatives of the ACL. It was in-
itiated by Steven Bird and is now maintained
by Min Yen Kan. It includes all papers pub-
lished by ACL and related organizations as
well as the Computational Linguistics journal
over a period of four decades. It is available
at http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/ .
One fundamental problem with the ACL
Anthology, however, is the fact that it is just
a collection of papers. It doesn’t include any
citation information or any statistics about the
productivity of the various researchers who
contributed papers to it. We embarked on an
ambitious initiative to manually annotate the
entire Anthology in order to make it possible
to compute such statistics.
In addition, we were able to use the anno-
tated data for extracting citation summaries of
all papers in the collection and we also anno-
tated each paper by the gender of the authors
(and are currently in the process of doing si-
milarly for their institutions) in the goal of
creating multiple gold standard data sets for
training automated systems for performing
such tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999922638888889">
The ACL Anthology includes 13,739 pa-
pers (excluding book reviews and posters).
Each of the papers was converted from pdf to
text using an OCR tool (www.pdfbox.org).
After this conversion, we extracted the refer-
ences semi-automatically using string match-
ing. The above process outputs all the
references as a single block so we then ma-
nually inserted line breaks between refer-
ences. These references were then manually
matched to other papers in the ACL Antholo-
gy using a “k-best” (with k = 5) string match-
ing algorithm built into a CGI interface. A
snapshot of this interface is shown in Figure
1. The matched references were stored to-
gether to produce the citation network. Refer-
ences to publications outside of the AAN
were recorded but not included in the net-
work.
In order to fix the issue of wrong author
names and multiple author identities we had
to perform a lot of manual post-processing.
The first names and the last names were
swapped for a lot of authors. For example, the
author name &amp;quot;Caroline Brun&amp;quot; was present as
&amp;quot;Brun Caroline&amp;quot; in some of her papers.
Another big source of error was the exclusion
of middle names or initials in a number of
papers. For example, Julia Hirschberg had
two identities as &amp;quot;Julia Hirschberg&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Julia
B. Hirschberg&amp;quot;. There were a few spelling
mistakes, like &amp;quot;Madeleine Bates&amp;quot; was miss-
pelled as &amp;quot;Medeleine Bates&amp;quot;.
Finally, many papers included incorrect
titles in their citation sections. Some used the
wrong years and/or venues as well.

3 Statistics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997698934782609">
Using the metadata and the citations ex-
tracted after curation, we have built three dif-
ferent networks.
The paper citation network is a directed
network with each node representing a paper
labeled with an ACL ID number and the
edges representing a citation within that paper
to another paper represented by an ACL ID.
The paper citation network consists of 13,739
papers and 54,538 citations.
The author citation network and the author
collaboration network are additional networks
derived from the paper citation network. In
both of these networks a node is created for
each unique author. In the author citation
network an edge is an occurrence of an author
citing another author. For example, if a paper
written by Franz Josef Och cites a paper writ-
ten by Joshua Goodman, then an edge is
created between Franz Josef Och and Joshua
Goodman. Self citations cause self loops in
the author citation network. The author cita-
tion network consists of 11,180 unique au-
thors and 332,815 edges (196,905 edges if
duplicates are removed).
In the author collaboration network, an
edge is created for each collaboration. For
example, if a paper is written by Franz Josef
Och and Hermann Ney, then an edge is
created between the two authors.
Table 1 shows some brief statistics about
the first two releases of the data set (2006 and
2007). Table 2 describes the most current re-
lease of the data set (from 2008).

A lot of different statistics have been
computed based on the data set release in
2007 by Radev et al. The statistics include
PageRank scores which eliminate PageRank&apos;s
inherent bias towards older papers, Impact
factor, correlations between different meas-
ures of impact like H-Index, total number of
incoming citations, PageRank. They also re-
port results from a regression analysis using
H-Index scores from different sources (AAN,
Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify
multi-disciplinary authors.

D08-1042 2 78:214 There has been a lot of progress in learning dependency tree parsers (McDonald et al., 2005;
Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008).
W08-2102 3 194:209 The method shows improvements over the method described in (Koo et al., 2008), which
is a state-of-the-art second-order dependency parser similar to that of (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), suggesting
that the incorporation of constituent structure can improve dependency accuracy.
W08-2102 4 32:209 The model also recovers dependencies with significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-

W08-2102 5 163:209 KCC08 unlabeled is from (Koo et al., 2008), a model that has previously been shown to
have higher accuracy than (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
