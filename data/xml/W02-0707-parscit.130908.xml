speech is sufficient to play a fundamental role in
conversation. Thus, it is much better that the pro-
cessing deals with speech directly. However, con-
ventional approaches of speech translation need a
text result, obtained by speech recognition, for ma-
chine translation although several errors or unrecog-
nized portions may be included in the result.
A text is translated through morphological anal-
ysis, syntactic analysis, and parsing of the sentence
of the target language. Finally, the speech synthesis
stage produces speech output of the target language.
Figure 1(A) shows the whole procedure of a tradi-
tional speech translation approach.
The procedure has several complicated processes
that do not give satisfying results. Therefore, the
lack of accuracy in each stage culminates into a poor
final result. For example, character strings obtained
by speech recognition may represent different infor-

This paper evaluates a direct speech trans-
lation Method with waveforms using the
Inductive Learning method for short con-
versation. The method is able to work
without conventional speech recognition
and speech synthesis because syntactic ex-
pressions are not needed for translation in
the proposed method. We focus only on
acoustic characteristics of speech wave-
forms of source and target languages with-
out obtaining character strings from ut-
terances. This speech translation method
can be utilized for any language because
the system has no processing dependent
on an individual character of a specific
language. Therefore, we can utilize the
speech of a handicapped person who is
not able to be treated by conventional
speech recognition systems, because we
do not need to segment the speech into
phonemes, syllables, or words to realize
speech translation. Our method is real-
ized by learning translation rules that have
acoustic correspondence between two lan-
guages inductively. In this paper, we deal
with a translation between Japanese and
English.

mation than the original speech.
Murakami et al.(1997) attempted to recognize
several vowels and consonants using Neural Net-
works that had different structures with TDNN
(ATR Lab., 1995), however, they could not obtain
a high accuracy of recognition. They confirmed that
distinguishing the boundaries of words, syllables, or
phonemes is a task of great difficulty. Then, they
only focused on speech waveform itself, not charac-
ter strings obtained by speech recognition to realize
speech translation. Murakami et.al decided on deal-
ing with the correspondence of acoustic characteris-
tics of speech waveform instead of character strings
between two utterances.
Our approach handles the acoustic characteris-
tics of speech without lexical expression through
a much simpler structure than the reports of Tak-
izawa et al.(1998) , MÂ¨uller et al.(1999) or Lavie et
al.(1997) because we believe that simplification of
the system would prevent inaccuracies in the trans-
lation. Figure 1(B) shows the processing stages of
our approach. If speech translation can be realized
by analyzing the correspondence in character strings
obtained by speech recognition, we can also build
up speech translation by dealing with the correspon-
dence in acoustic characteristics. In our method, we
extract acoustic common parts and different parts
by comparing two examples of acoustic characteris-
tics of speech between two translation pairs within
the same language. Then we generate translation
rules and register them in a translation dictionary.
The rules also have the location information of ac-
quired parts for speech synthesis on time-domain.
The translation rules are acquired not only by com-
paring speech utterances but also using the Inductive
Learning Method (K. Araki et al., 2001), still keep-
ing acoustic information within the rules. Deciding
the correspondence of meaning between two lan-
guages is a unique condition to realize our method.
In a translation phase, when an unknown utterance
of a source language is applied to be translated, the
system compares this sentence with all acoustic in-
formation of all rules within the source language.
Then several matched rules are utilized and referred
to their corresponding parts of the target language.
Finally, we obtain roughly synthesized target speech
by simply concatenating several suitable parts of
rules in the target language according to the infor-
mation of location. Figure 2 shows an overview of
the processing structure of our method.
Our method has several advantages over other ap-
proaches. First, the performance of the translation is
not affected by the lack of accuracy in speech recog-
nition because we do not need the segmentation of
speech into words, syllables, or phonemes. There-
fore, our method can be applied for all languages
without having to make processing changes in the
machine translation stage because there is no pro-
cessing dependent on any specific language. With
conventional methods, several processes in the ma-
chine translation stage must be altered if the tar-
get language is to be changed because morpholog-
ical analysis and syntactic analysis are dependent on
each individual character of language completely.
Any difference in language has no affect on the
ability of the proposed method, fundamentally be-
cause we focus on the acoustic characteristics of
speech, not on the character strings of languages.
It is very important to approach speech translation
with a new methodology that is independent of indi-
vidual characters of any language.
We also expect our approach can be utilized
in speech recuperation systems for people with a
speech impediment because our method is able to
deal with various types of speech that is not able to
be treated by conventional speech recognition sys-
tems for normal voice.
Murakami et al.(2002) have successfully ob-
tained several samples of translation by applying our
method using local recorded speech data and spon-
taneous conversation speech.
In this paper, we adopt speech data of travel con-
versations to the proposed method. We evaluate the
performance of the method through experiments and
offer discussion on behaviors of the system.

It is necessary to extract time-varying spectral char-
acteristics in utterances and apply them to the sys-
tem. We used several conversation sets from an
English conversation book (GEOS Publishing Inc.,
1999). The Japanese speech data was recorded with
a 48kHz sampling rate on DAT, and downsampled
to 8kHz. All speech data in the source language
was spoken by Japanese male students of our lab-
oratory. The speech data was spoken by 2 people in
the source and target languages, respectively.
The content of the data sets consists of conversa-
tions between a client and the front desk at a hotel
and conversations between a client and train station
staff.

2.2 Spectral characteristics of speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999032838709677">
In our approach, the acoustic characteristics of
speech are very important because we must find
common and different acoustic parts by comparing
them. It is assumed that acoustic characteristics are
not dependent on any language. Table 1 shows the
conditions for speech analysis. The same conditions
and the same kind of characteristic parameters of
speech are used throughout the experiments.
In this report, the LPC coefficients are applied as
spectral parameters because Murakami et al.(2002)
could obtain better results by using these parameters
than other representations of speech characteristics.
2.3 Searching for the start point of parts
between utterances
When speech samples were being compared, we had
to consider how to normalize the elasticity on time-
domain. Many methods were investigated to resolve
this problem. We tried meditating a method that
is able to obtain a result similar to dynamic pro-
gramming (H. Sakoe et al., 1978; H. F. Silverman
et al., 1990) to execute time-domain normalization.
We adopted a method to investigate the difference
between two characteristic vectors of speech sam-
ples for determining common and different acous-
tic parts. The Least-Squares Distance Method was
adopted for the calculation of the similarity between
these vectors.
Two sequences of characteristic vectors named
âtest vectorâ and âreference vectorâ are prepared.
The âtest vectorâ is picked out from the test speech
by a window that has definite length. At the time, the

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995816">
âreference vectorâ is also prepared from the refer-
ence speech. A distance value is calculated by com-
paring the present âtest vectorâ and a portion of the
âreference vectorâ. Then, we repeat the calculation
between the current âtest vectorâ and all portions
of the âreference vectorâ picked out and shifted in
each moment with constant interval on time-domain.
When a portion of the âreference vectorâ reaches the
end of the whole reference vector, a sequence of dis-
tance values is obtained as a result. The procedure of
comparing two vectors is shown as Figure 3. Next,
the new âtest vectorâ is picked out by the constant
interval, then the calculation mentioned above is re-
peated until the end of the âtest vectorâ. Finally, we
should get several distance curves as the result be-
tween two speech samples.
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show examples of the differ-
ence between two utterances. These applied speech
samples are spoken by the same speaker. The con-
tents of the compared utterances are the same in Fig-
ure 4, and are quite different in Figure 5. The hori-
zontal axis shows the shift number of reference vec-
tor on time-domain and the vertical axis shows the
shift number of test vector, i.e., the portion of test
speech. In the figures, a curve in the lowest loca-
tion has been drawn by comparing the top of the test
speech and whole reference speech. If a distance
value in a distance curve is obviously lowest than
other distance values, it means that the two vectors
have much acoustic similarity.
As shown in Figure 5, the obvious local minimum
distance point is not discovered even if there is the
lowest point in each distance curve. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 4, when the test and refer-
ence speech have the same content, the minimum
distance values are found sequentially in distance
curves. According to these results, if there is a po-
sition of the obviously smallest distance point in a
distance curve, that portion should be regarded as a
âcommon partâ. Moreover, if these points sequen-
tially appear among several distance curves, they
will be considered a common part. At the time,
there is a possibility that the part corresponds to sev-
eral semantic segments, longer than a phoneme and
a syllable.
2.4 Evaluation of the obvious minimal distance
value
To determine that the obviously lowest distance
value in the distance curve is a common part, we
adopt a threshold calculated by statistical informa-
tion. We calculate the variance of distance values
shown as Q and the mean value within the curve.
The threshold is conducted as 0 = 4î2 from the
equation of the Gaussian distribution and the stan-
dardized normal distribution.
A point of the smallest distance value within a
curve is represented by x and a parameter m shows
the mean value of distances. A common part is de-
tected if (x â m)2 &gt; 0, because the portion of
reference speech has much similarity with the âtest
vectorâ of the distance curve in a point, and that
common part is represented by â0â. Otherwise the
speech portion for âtest vectorâ is regarded as a dif-
ferent part and represented by â1â. If several com-
mon parts are decided continuously, we deal with
them as one common part, and the first point in that
part will be the start point finally. In our method,
the acoustic similarities evaluated by several calcu-
lations are only the factor for judgment in classifying
common or different parts in the speech samples.

The two reference speech samples are divided into
several common and different parts by comparison.
However, there is a possibility that these parts in-
clude several errors of elasticity normalization be-
cause the distance calculation is not perfect to re-
solve this problem on time-domain. We attempt to
correct incomplete common and different parts us-
ing heuristic techniques when a common part is di-
vided by a discrete different part, or a different part

Common and different parts corrected in 3.1 are ap-
plied to determine the rule elements needed to gen-
erate translation rules. Figure 6 and 7 show the re-
sults of comparing utterances. In the first case, a
part containing continuous values of â0â represents
a common part. In the second case, a part consisting
of only â1â is regarded as a different part. In Fig-
ure 6, two utterances are calculated as a long com-
mon part. On the contrary, two utterances are cal-
culated as a long different part in Figure 7. These
results are comparable with lexical contents because
the syntactic sentence structures are the same in both
cases.
Moreover, when a sentence structure includes
common and different parts at the same time, we can
treat this structure as a third case. We deal with these
three cases of sentence structure as rule types. In all
the above-mentioned cases, several sets of common
and different parts are acquired if those utterances
were almost matching or did not match at all. Com-
bining sets of common parts of the source and target
languages become elements of the translation rules
for its generation. At this time, the set of common
parts extracted from the source language, that have

a correspondence of meaning with a set of common
parts in target language, are kept. The sets of differ-
ent parts become elements of the translation rules as
well.
Finally, these translation rules are generated by
completing all elements as below. It is very im-
portant the rules are acquired if the types of sen-
tences in both languages are the same. When the
types of sentence structures are different, it is im-
possible that translation rules are obtained and reg-
istered in the rule dictionary because we can not
decide the correspondence between two languages
samples uniquely. Acquired rules are categorized in
the following types:
Rule type 1: those with a very high sentence simi-
larity
Rule type 2: those with sentences including com-
mon and different parts
Rule type 3: those with very low sentence similar-
ity
When a new rule containing the information of sev-
eral common parts is generated, the rule should
keep the sentence form so that different parts in the
speech sample are replaced as variables. Informa-
tion that a translation rule has are as follows:

When an unknown speech utterance of a source lan-
guage is adapted to get the result of translation,
acoustic information of acquired parts in the trans-
lation rules are compared in turn with the unknown
speech, and several matched rules become the candi-
dates to translate. The inputted utterance should be
reproduced by a combination of several candidates
of rules. Then, the corresponding parts of the tar-
get language in candidate rules are referred to obtain
translated speech. Although the final synthesized
target speech may be produced roughly, speech can
directly be concatenated by several suitable parts of
rules in the target language using the location infor-
mation on time-domain in rules.

4 The Inductive Learning Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999629296296296">
The Inductive Learning that Araki et al.(2001) pro-
posed acquires rules by extracting common and dif-
ferent parts through the comparison between two
samples. This method is designed from an assump-
tion that a human being is able to find out common
and different parts between two samples although
these are unknown. The method is also able to ob-
tain rules by repetition of the acquired rules regis-
tered in the rule dictionary.
Figure 8 shows an overview of recursive rule ac-
quisition by this learning method. Two rules ac-
quired as rule(i) and rule(j) are prepared and com-
pared to extract common and different acoustic parts
as well as comparisons between speech samples.
Then, these obtained parts are designed as new rules.
If the compared rules consist of several common
or different parts, the calculation is repeated within
each part. It is assumed that these new rules are
much more reliable for translation.
If several rules are not useful for translation, they
will be eliminated by generalizing the rule dictio-
nary optimally to keep a designed size of memory.
The ability of optimal generalization in the Induc-
tive Learning Method is an advantage, as less exam-
ples have to be prepared beforehand. Much sample
data is needed to acquire many suitable rules with
conventional approaches.

If an unknown speech utterance of a source language
can be replaced with acoustic information from rules
in the dictionary, the speech will be translated and
synthesized roughly without losing itâs meaning.
Each matched rule includes certain equivalent cor-
respondence parts of the target language. The sys-
tem needs to decide the most suitable candidates of
rules from the rule dictionary for each translation.
If the level of similarity between the whole applied
unknown speech and all parts of the rules is higher
than a rate of agreement as in Table 2, the rules that
include appropriate parts can become candidates for
current translation.
82 utterances of limited domain have been ap-
plied to the system for translation. Regretfully, we
could not obtain any complete translated utterances,
although several samples have been incompletely
translated by adapting translation rules.

We have to investigate several sources of the exper-
imental results. The first cause of the failure in the
translation can be found in speech data utilized in
these experiments. The contents of these utterances
do not exactly include the same expression because

contents of speech samples are prepared with vari-
ous ways of speaking even if the semantic informa-
tion is the same among them.
Moreover, a small amount of speech data also is
another factor because more translation rules should
be acquired and adapted for translation.
The system has performed the task because many
suitable rules are registered in the rule dictionary. A
sample of parts acquired properly is shown as Ta-
ble 4. In this table, Japanese words are expressed
with an italic font. These parts are successfully ac-
quired through the learning stage, so that many suit-
able rules can be applied to other unknown speech
utterances.
Therefore, we need to increase the number of
speech samples to obtain more translation rules, and
it is also necessary to consider the contents of utter-
ances for more effective rule acquisition and appli-
cation.
In addition, we have paid attention to the parts
themselves acquired as translation rules. We have
to consider several causes where the same type of
sentences is not determined correctly even when the
contents are the same. Table 5 shows the number of
failures in whole rule acquisition and in the case of
comparisons of the same utterances. The types of
sentences are determined by the results of the parts
extraction stage. In this stage, thresholds have a
much important role for deciding common and dif-
ferent parts. Figure 9 shows the distance curves of
the same utterances that were not determined as a
common part by a threshold. And Figure 10 shows
the result of the extraction of common and different
parts. Several minimum points of distance curves
have been determined as different parts by thresh-
old although two portions of utterances also have the
highest similarity in these points. This kind of fail-
ure means that the definition of the threshold has a
problem. Therefore, the definition of the threshold
needs to be reconsidered for extracting common and
different parts much more correctly.

<bodyText confidence="0.998161642857143">
In this paper, we have described the proposed
method and have evaluated the translation perfor-
mance for conversations on travel English. We have
confirmed that much appropriate acoustic informa-
tion is extracted by comparing speech, and rules
have been generated even if no target speech was
obtained through the system.
Many rules have been decided as candidates for
each translation by calculating all registered rules
with a high calculation cost. Therefore, we will
need to apply a method for selecting most suitable
rules from candidates and a clustering algorithm to
decrease the number of registered rules and the cal-
culation cost.
We will consider adopting a new approach for re-
alizing a more effective threshold without statistical
information.
We will also consider a possibility of the direct
speech translation system from speech by a person
with a handicap in the speech production organ to
normal speech because conventional speech recog-
nition methods are not able to assist those with a
speech impediment.

<abstract confidence="0.9878556875">Figure 1: Comparison of conventional and our approach. speech is sufficient to play a fundamental role in conversation. Thus, it is much better that the processing deals with speech directly. However, conventional approaches of speech translation need a text result, obtained by speech recognition, for machine translation although several errors or unrecognized portions may be included in the result. A text is translated through morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, and parsing of the sentence of the target language. Finally, the speech synthesis stage produces speech output of the target language. Figure 1(A) shows the whole procedure of a traditional speech translation approach. The procedure has several complicated processes that do not give satisfying results. Therefore, the lack of accuracy in each stage culminates into a poor final result. For example, character strings obtained speech recognition may represent different infor- Abstract This paper evaluates a direct speech translation Method with waveforms using the Inductive Learning method for short conversation. The method is able to work without conventional speech recognition and speech synthesis because syntactic expressions are not needed for translation in the proposed method. We focus only on acoustic characteristics of speech waveforms of source and target languages without obtaining character strings from utterances. This speech translation method can be utilized for any language because the system has no processing dependent on an individual character of a specific language. Therefore, we can utilize the speech of a handicapped person who is not able to be treated by conventional speech recognition systems, because we do not need to segment the speech into phonemes, syllables, or words to realize speech translation. Our method is realized by learning translation rules that have acoustic correspondence between two languages inductively. In this paper, we deal with a translation between Japanese and English.</abstract>
