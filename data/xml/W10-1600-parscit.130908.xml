<bodyText confidence="0.97000735">
Welcome to the First Young Investigators Workshop on Computational Approaches to Languages of
the Americas. This workshop will be held on June 6, 2010 in Los Angeles, immediately following
the 11th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, NAACL-HLT 2010. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from all of
the Americas developing human language technologies that are interested in establishing international
collaborations. We believe a more interactive community within the Americas can contribute to the
advancement of the field, not only with respect to the improvement of performance on specific areas
of NLP but more important, with respect to motivating the growth of its community by providing a
conducive collaboration infrastructure that facilitates the active involvement of researchers in the field.
We are very excited about the response to the call for papers. We received a total of 21 submissions
from 8 countries. The final program brings together researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay and the USA. The contributions in the proceedings are of three types:
research papers, project overviews and opinion papers. The research papers include recent advances
in topics from opinion mining, to textual entailment, to adaptation of NLP approaches to software
engineering. The survey papers present an overview of larger research projects by a single university
or research group. These overviews present interesting efforts in dialogue systems, text simplification,
language generation, and corpus based approaches to verb subcategorization and relation extraction.
The proceedings also include two opinion papers that describe the research situation of the NLP
communities in Costa Rica and Brazil. All contributions describe how international collaborations
can push research forward by either listing the resources and/or experience sought or what specific
resources and experience can be contributed. In sum, these proceedings provide a broad coverage
of research on computational linguistics south of the Rio Bravo addressing three different languages:
Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and English.
We would like to thank the program committee members for their support in spreading the call
for papers and providing a conscientious and timely review. Without their support this workshop
would have not been as successful. We would also like to thank the NAACL-HLT 2010 Workshop
Chairs, David Traum and Richard Sproat for all their help and great overseeing of the logistics of this
workshop. Lastly, we were able to offer travel support and full conference registration waivers due to
the very generous support of the NAACL Executive Board, and the Information and Intelligent Systems
Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation
(USA) award number 1008711.
As part of the one day workshop, the program will also include a panel discussion to brainstorm on
ways to promote a more interactive community on this side of the globe, and the possibility of having
more workshops of this kind. A summary from this panel will be available on the workshop website
soon after the event: (http://groups.google.com/group/naacl-2010-yi-workshop).
We are are looking forward to a great event and hope that initiatives like these will eventually lead to a
stronger and tighter computational linguistics research community on the Americas.
