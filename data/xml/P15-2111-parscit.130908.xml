This paper presents a universal morphological fea-
ture schema that represents the finest distinctions in
meaning that are expressed by overt, affixal inflec-
tional morphology across languages. This schema
is used to universalize data extracted from Wik-
tionary via a robust multidimensional table parsing
algorithm and feature mapping algorithms, yielding
883,965 instantiated paradigms in 352 languages.
These data are shown to be effective for training
morphological analyzers, yielding significant accu-
racy gains when applied to Durrett and DeNero’s

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999937370370371">
Semantically detailed and typologically-informed
morphological analysis that is broadly cross-
linguistically applicable and interoperable has the
potential to improve many NLP applications, in-
cluding machine translation (particularly of mor-
phologically rich languages), parsing (Choi et al.,
2015; Zeman, 2008; Mikulov´a et al., 2006), n-
gram language models, information extraction,
and co-reference resolution.
To do large-scale cross-linguistic analysis and
translation, it is necessary to be able to compare
the meanings of morphemes using a single, well-
defined framework. Haspelmath (2010) notes that
while morphological categories will never map
with perfect precision across languages and can
only be exhaustively defined within a single lan-
guage, practitioners of linguistic typology have
typically recognized that there is sufficient simi-
larity in these categories across languages to do
meaningful comparison. For this purpose, Haspel-
math (2010) proposes that typologists precisely
define dedicated language-independent compara-
tive concepts and identify the presence of these
concepts in specific languages. In this spirit, we
present a universal morphological feature schema,
in which features that have a status akin to those
of comparative concepts are used to represent the
finest distinctions in meaning that are expressed
by inflectional morphology across languages. This
schema can in turn be used to universalize mor-
phological data from the world’s languages, which
allows for direct comparison and translation of
morphological material across languages. This
greatly increases the amount of data available to
morphological analysis tools, since data from any
language can be specified in a common format
with the same features.
Wiktionary constitutes one of the largest
available sources of complete morphological
paradigms across diverse languages, with sub-
stantial ongoing growth in language and lemma
coverage, and hence forms a natural source of
data for broadly multilingual supervised learn-
ing. Wiktionary paradigm table formats, how-
ever, are often complex, nested, 2-3 dimensional
structures intended for human readability rather
than machine parsing, and are broadly inconsistent
across languages and Wiktionary editions. This
paper presents an original, robust multidimen-
sional table parsing system that generalizes effec-
tively across these languages, collectively yield-
ing significant gains in supervised morphological
paradigm learning in Durrett and DeNero’s (2013)
framework.

Schema

The purpose of the universal morphological fea-
ture schema is to allow any given overt, affixal
(non-root) inflectional morpheme in any language
to be given a precise, language-independent def-
inition. The schema is composed of a set of
features that represent semantic “atoms” that are
never decomposed into more finely differentiated
meanings in any natural language. This ensures
that the meanings of all inflectional morphemes
are able to be represented either through single
features or through multiple features in combina-

tion. These features capture only the semantic
content of morphemes, but can be integrated into
existing frameworks that precisely indicate mor-
pheme form (Sagot and Walther, 2013) or auto-
matically discover it (Dreyer and Eisner, 2011;
Hammarstr¨om, 2006; Goldsmith, 2001). The fact
that the schema is meant to capture only the mean-
ings of overt, non-root affixal morphemes restricts
the semantic-conceptual space that must be cap-
tured by its features and renders an interlingual
approach to representing inflectional morphology
feasible.
The universal morphological feature schema
is most similar to tagset systematization efforts
across multiple languages, such as the Univer-
sal Dependencies Project (Choi et al., 2015) and
Interset (Zeman, 2008). While these efforts en-
code similar morphological features to the cur-
rent schema, their goal is different, namely to sys-
tematize pre-existing tagsets, which include lex-
ical and syntactic information, for 30 specific
languages. The goal of the schema presented
here is to capture the most basic meanings en-
coded by inflectional morphology across all the
world’s languages and to define those meanings
in a language-independent manner. Because of its
wide-scope, our universal morphological feature
schema will likely need to include other features
and even other dimensions of meaning, for which
the authors invite suggestions.

2.1 Construction Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998436">
The first step in constructing the universal mor-
phological feature schema was to identify the di-
mensions of meaning (e.g. case, number, tense,
mood, etc.) that are expressed by inflectional mor-
phology in the world’s languages. These were
identified by surveying the linguistic typology lit-
erature on parts of speech and then identifying the
kinds of inflectional morphology that are typically
associated with each part of speech.
For each dimension, we identified the finest dis-
tinctions in meaning made within that dimension
by a natural language. Some higher-level ‘cover
features’ representing common cross-linguistic
groupings were also included. For example, fea-
tures such as indicative (IND) and subjunctive
(SBJV) represent groupings of basic modality fea-
tures which occur in multiple languages and show
similar usage patterns (Palmer, 2001).
Each dimension has an underlying semantic ba-
sis used to define its features. To determine the
underlying semantic basis for each dimension, the
literature in linguistic typology and in description-
oriented linguistic theory was surveyed for expla-
nations of each dimension that offered ways to
precisely define the observed features.

2.2 Contents of the Schema
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993947368421">
The universal morphological feature schema rep-
resents 23 dimensions of meaning with 212 fea-
tures. Because space limitations preclude a de-
tailed discussion of the semantic basis of each di-
mension and the definitions of each feature, Ta-
ble 1 presents each dimension of meaning, the
labels of its features, and citations for the main
sources for the semantic bases of each dimension.
To the extent possible, feature labels conform to
the Leipzig Glossing Rules (Comrie et al., 2008)
and to the labels in the sources used to define the
semantic basis for each dimension of meaning. A
substantially expanded exploration and analysis of
these dimensions and schema framework may be
found in Sylak-Glassman et al. (To appear).
Note that because gender categories are not nec-
essarily defined by semantic criteria and rarely
map neatly across languages, this schema treats
gender features as open-class.1

3 Wiktionary Data Extraction and
Mapping
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98409712">
Wiktionary contains a wealth of training data for
morphological analysis, most notably inflectional
paradigm tables. Since its pages are primar-
ily written by human authors for human readers,
and there are no overarching standards for how
paradigms should be presented, these tables con-
tain many inconsistencies and are at best semi-
structured. Layouts differ depending on the edi-
tion language in which a word is being defined
and within an edition depending on the word’s lan-
guage and part of speech. The textual descriptors
used for morphological features are also not sys-
tematically defined. These idiosyncrasies cause
numerous difficulties for automatic paradigm ex-
traction, but the redundancy of having data pre-
sented in multiple ways across different editions
gives us an opportunity to arrive at a consensus
description of an inflected form, and to fill in gaps
when the coverage of one edition diverges from
1To limit feature proliferation, the schema encodes gender
categories as features that may be shared across languages
within a phylogenetic stock or family, in order to capture
identical gender category definitions and assignments that re-
sult from common ancestry, as may be possible for the 25
historical noun classes in the Bantu stock (Demuth, 2000).

To make these data available for morphologi-
cal analysis, we developed a novel multidimen-
sional table parser for Wiktionary to extract in-
flected forms with their associated descriptors. Al-
though we describe its function in Wiktionary-
specific terms, this strategy can be generalized to
extract data tuples from any HTML table with cor-
rectly marked-up header and content cells. We ex-
tracted additional descriptors from HTML head-
ings and table captions, then mapped all descrip-
tors to features in the universal schema.

3.1 Extraction from HTML Tables

<bodyText confidence="0.802241666666667">
In its base form, the table parser takes advantage
of HTML’s distinction between header and content
cells to identify descriptors and potential inflected
forms, respectively, in an arbitrary inflection ta-
ble. Each content cell is matched with the head-
ers immediately up the column, to the left of the
row, and in the “corners” located at the row and
column intersection of the previous two types of
headers. Matching headers are stored in a list or-
dered by their distance from the content cell. Fig-
ure 1 shows an example where prenais is assigned
the following descriptors:
– Directly up the column: tu, second, singu-
lar, simple.
– Directly to the left of the row: imperfect,
simple tenses.
– In corners located at the row and column in-
tersection of any headers identified by the previous
two methods: indicative, person.
– Important structured fields found outside the
table, including French and Verb.

Further, when additional content cells intervene
between headers, as they do between simple and
singular, the more distant header is marked as
“distal.” This labeling is important for proper han-
dling of the column header simple in this exam-

should be left out of any labeling of the inflected
forms in the lower half. This distance information,
and a hierarchy of positional precedence, is used
in Section 3.4 to discount these and other poten-
tially irrelevant descriptors in the case of conflicts
during the subsequent mapping of descriptors to
features in the universal schema. In general, the
positionally highest ranking header value for each
schema dimension are utilized and lower-ranking
conflicting values are discarded.

For some languages, inflected forms are presented
inline next to the headword, instead of in a sep-
arate table, as shown for the German noun Haus
‘house’:
Haus n (genitive Hauses, plural H¨auser, diminu-
tive H¨auschen n or H¨auslein n)
Here, the italic n indicates a neuter noun. The in-
flection data inside the parentheses are extracted
as simple tuples containing the lemma, inflected
form, and inflectional relationship (e.g. Haus,
H¨auser, plural).

3.3 Improving Extraction Accuracy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999093220339">
The approach described above is sufficient to parse
most Wiktionary data, but a large percentage of
Wiktionary inflection tables do not use the cor-
rect tags to distinguish between header and content
cells, an important component of the parsing pro-
cedure. In particular, table authors frequently use
only the content cell tag to mark up all of a table’s
cells, and create “soft” headers with a distinct vi-
sual appearance by changing their styling (as with
Czech verbs, such as spadat ‘to be included, fall
off’). This is indistinguishable to human viewers,
but a naive parse mistakes the soft headers for in-
flected forms with no descriptors. Hence we in-
vestigated several methods for robustly identifying
improperly marked-up table headers and overrid-
ing the HTML cell-type tags in a preprocessing
step.
Visual identification. Since most of the soft
headers on Wiktionary have a distinct background
color from the rest of their containing tables, we
initially added a rule that treated content cells that
defined a background color in HTML or inline
CSS as header cells. However, the mere pres-
ence of this attribute was not a reliable indicator
since some tables, such as those for Latin nouns
(e.g. aqua ‘water’), gave every cell a background
color. This caused them to be erroneously con-
sidered to consist entirely of headers, resulting in
missing data. Other tables used background color
for highlighting, as with Faroese nouns (e.g. vatn
‘water’) and the past historic row in Figure 1,
whose inflected forms were considered to be head-
ers. For these reasons, visual cues were assessed
as an unreliable method of identification.
Frequency-based methods. Another, more suc-
cessful strategy for header discrimination header
discrimination utilized the frequency characteris-
tics of cell text, regardless of the cell’s type. Al-
though Wiktionary’s inflection tables have many
different layouts, words with the same language
and part of speech pair often share a single tem-
plate with consistent descriptors. In addition,
many simple descriptors, such as singular, oc-
cur frequently throughout a single edition. Each
inflected form, however, can be expected to ap-
pear on only a few pages (and in most cases just
one). We exploited this tendency by counting the
number of pages where each distinct cell text in
a Wiktionary edition appeared, and, for each lan-
guage, manually determined a cutoff point above
which any cell with matching text was consid-
ered a header. Cells containing only punctuation
were excluded from consideration, to avoid prob-
lems with dashes that occurred in many tables as
a content cell indicating that no such form existed.
This strategy surmounted all the problems identi-
fied thus far, including both the improper tagging
of headers as content cells and the overspecifica-
tion of background colors.

3.4 Mapping Inflected Forms to Universal
Features

Using the results of the frequency-based prepro-
cessing step to the table parsing algorithm, the first
two authors manually inspected the list of parsed
cells and their frequencies within each language,
and then determined both a threshold for inclusion
as a header feature (descriptor) and a universal
representation for each header feature. When pos-
sible header features were above the threshold, but
judged not to be contentful, they were not given a
universal schema representation.
All inflected forms found by our scrape of Wik-
tionary were assigned complete universal repre-
sentation vectors by looking up each of their Wik-
tionary descriptors using the mapping described in
the above paragraph and then concatenating the re-
sults. Any conflicts within a dimension were re-

To test the accuracy, consistency, and utility of
our Wiktionary extraction and feature mappings,
the fully mapped data from the English edition
of Wiktionary were used as input to Durrett and
DeNero’s (2013) morphological paradigm learner.
While the results were comparable to those ob-
tained by the hand-tooled and language-specific
table parsers of Durrett and DeNero (2013) given
an equivalent quantity of training data, the num-
ber of language and part of speech combinations
which could be subjected to analysis using data
from our general-purpose Wiktionary parser and
mapping to features in the universal schema was
far greater: 123 language-POS pairs (88 distinct
languages) versus Durrett and DeNero’s 5 pairs (3
languages).2 In addition, when the available train-
ing data were increased from 500 lemmas to the
full amount (a number that varied per language but
was always &gt; 2000), x2 tests demonstrated that
the gain in wordform generation accuracy was sta-
tistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) for 44% (14/32) of
the tested language-POS pairs. In the language-
POS pairs without significant gains, wordforms
were predictable using smaller amounts of data.
For example, nearly half (8/18) of the language-
POS pairs in this category were nouns in Romance
languages, whose pluralization patterns typically
involve simply adding /-s/ or some similar variant.
Some of the language-POS pairs with significant

The proposed universal morphological feature
schema incorporates findings from research in lin-
guistic typology to provide a cross-linguistically
applicable method of labeling inflectional mor-
phemes according to their meaning. The schema
offers many potential benefits for NLP and ma-
chine translation by facilitating direct meaning-
to-meaning comparison and translation across lan-
guage pairs. We have also developed original, ro-
bust and general multidimensional table parsing
and feature mapping algorithms. We then applied
these algorithms and universal schema to Wik-
tionary to generate a significant sharable resource,
namely standardized universal feature representa-
tions for inflected wordforms from 883,965 instan-
tiated paradigms across 352 languages. We have
shown that these data can be used to successfully
train morphological analysis tools, and that the in-
creased amount of data available can significantly
improve their accuracy.

<abstract confidence="0.994196384615385">This paper presents a universal morphological feature schema that represents the finest distinctions in meaning that are expressed by overt, affixal inflectional morphology across languages. This schema is used to universalize data extracted from Wiktionary via a robust multidimensional table parsing algorithm and feature mapping algorithms, yielding 883,965 instantiated paradigms in 352 languages. These data are shown to be effective for training morphological analyzers, yielding significant accuracy gains when applied to Durrett and DeNero’s (2013) paradigm learning framework.</abstract>

Because space limitations preclude a detailed discussion of the semantic basis of each dimension and the definitions of each feature, Table 1 presents each dimension of meaning, the labels of its features, and citations for the main sources for the semantic bases of each dimension. To the extent possible, feature labels conform to the Leipzig Glossing Rules (Comrie et al., 2008) and to the labels in the sources used to define the semantic basis for each dimension of meaning. A substantially expanded exploration and analysis of these dimensions and schema framework may be found in Sylak-Glassman et al. (To appear). Note that because gender categories are not necessarily defined by semantic criteria and rarely map neatly across languages, this schema treats gender features as open-class.1 3 Wiktionary Data Extraction and Mapping Wiktionary contains a wealth of training data for morphological analysis, most notably inflectional paradigm tables.

To do large-scale cross-linguistic analysis and translation, it is necessary to be able to compare the meanings of morphemes using a single, welldefined framework. Haspelmath (2010) notes that while morphological categories will never map with perfect precision across languages and can only be exhaustively defined within a single language, practitioners of linguistic typology have typically recognized that there is sufficient similarity in these categories across languages to do meaningful comparison. For this purpose, Haspelmath (2010) proposes that typologists precisely define dedicated language-independent comparative concepts and identify the presence of these concepts in specific languages. In this spirit, we present a universal morphological feature schema, in whic</context>

For each dimension, we identified the finest distinctions in meaning made within that dimension by a natural language. Some higher-level ‘cover features’ representing common cross-linguistic groupings were also included. For example, features such as indicative (IND) and subjunctive (SBJV) represent groupings of basic modality features which occur in multiple languages and show similar usage patterns (Palmer, 2001). Each dimension has an underlying semantic basis used to define its features. To determine the underlying semantic basis for each dimension, the literature in linguistic typology and in descriptionoriented linguistic theory was surveyed for explanations of each dimension that offered ways to precisely define the observed features. 2.2 Contents of the Schema The universal morphological feature schema represents 23 dimensions of meaning with 212 features.

These data are shown to be effective for training morphological analyzers, yielding significant accuracy gains when applied to Durrett and DeNero’s (2013) paradigm learning framework. 1 Introduction Semantically detailed and typologically-informed morphological analysis that is broadly crosslinguistically applicable and interoperable has the potential to improve many NLP applications, including machine translation (particularly of morphologically rich languages), parsing (Choi et al., 2015; Zeman, 2008; Mikulov´a et al., 2006), ngram language models, information extraction, and co-reference resolution. To do large-scale cross-linguistic analysis and translation, it is necessary to be able to compare the meanings of morphemes using a single, welldefined framework. Haspelmath (2010) notes that while morphological categories will never map with perfect precision across languages and can only be exhaustively defined within a single language, practitioners of linguistic typology have typically recognized that there is sufficient similarity in these categories across languages to do meaningful co</context>

The fact that the schema is meant to capture only the meanings of overt, non-root affixal morphemes restricts the semantic-conceptual space that must be captured by its features and renders an interlingual approach to representing inflectional morphology feasible. The universal morphological feature schema is most similar to tagset systematization efforts across multiple languages, such as the Universal Dependencies Project (Choi et al., 2015) and Interset (Zeman, 2008). While these efforts encode similar morphological features to the current schema, their goal is different, namely to systematize pre-existing tagsets, which include lexical and syntactic information, for 30 specific languages. The goal of the schema presented here is to capture the most basic meanings encoded by inflectional morphology across all the world’s languages and to define those meanings in a language-independent manner. Because of its wide-scope, our universal morphological feature schema will likely need to include other features and even other dimensions of meaning, for which the </context>
