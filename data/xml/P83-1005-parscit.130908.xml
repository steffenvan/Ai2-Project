The editors of the Al Journal recently hit upon
the nice notion of correspondents&apos; columns. The
basic idea was to solicit experts in various
fields both within and outside of Artificial
Intelligence, to provide &amp;quot;guidance to important,
interesting current literature&amp;quot; in their fields.
For Philosophy, they made the happy choice of Dan
Dennett; for natural language processing, the
equally happy choice of Barbara Grosz. Each has so
far contributed one column, and these early
contributions overlap in one, and as it happens,
only one, particular; to wit: Situation Semantics.
Witness Dennett:
...situation semantics - [is] the
hottest new topic in philosophical
logic...[is] in some ways a successor or
rival to Montague semantics.

In recent work, Barwise and Perry
address the problem [of what information
from the context of an utterance affects
which aspects of interpretation and how?]
in the context of a proposed model theory
of natural language, one that appears to be
more compatible with the needs of Al than
previous theories.... [I]t is of interest
to work in natural-language processing for
the kind of compositional semantics it
proposes, and the way in which it allows
the contexts in which in an utterance is
used to affect its interpretation.
What is all the fuss about? I want to address
this question, but rather indirectly. I want to
situate situation semantics in &amp;quot;conceptual space&amp;quot;
and draw some comparisons and contrasts between it
and accounts in the style of Richard Montague. To
this end, a few preliminary points are in order.

First, as to the state of the Situation
Semantics literature. There is as yet no published
piece of the scope and detail of either &amp;quot;English as
a Formal Language&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Proper Treatment of
Quantification in Ordinary English&amp;quot;. Nor, of
course, is there anything like that large body of
work by philosophers and linguists - computational

So what is there? Besides a few published
papers, each of them containing at least one
position since abandoned; there is a book
Situations and Attitudes literally on the very
verge of publication. This contains the
philosophical/theoretical background of the program
- The Big Picture. It also contains a very brief
treatment of a very simple fragment of ALIASS. And
what, the reader may well ask is ALIASS? An
Artificial Language for Illustrating Aspects of
aituation Lemantics, that&apos;s what. Moreover there
is in the works a collaborative effort, to be
called Situations and Discourse.* This will contain
a &amp;quot;Fragment of Situation Semantics&amp;quot;, a treatment of
an extended fragment of English. Last, for the
moment, but not least, is a second book by Barwise
and Perry, Situation Semantics, which will include
a treatment of an even more extended fragment of
English, together with a self-contained treatment
of the technical, mathematical background. (By
&amp;quot;self-contained&amp;quot;, understand: not requiring either
familiarity with or acceptance of The Big Picture
presented in LiA.) The bottom line: there is very
little of Situation Semantics presently available
to the masses of hungry researchers.

B. Similarities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99902678125">
There are important points of similarity between
Situation and Montague semantics, of course. One
is that both are committed to formulating
mathematically rigorous semantic accounts of
English. To this end, both, of course, dip heavily
into set theory. But this isn&apos;t saying a whole
lot; for they deploy very different set theories.
Montague, for a variety of technical reasons, was
very fond of MKM, a very powerful theory,
countenancing huge collections. MKM allows for
both sets and (proper) classes, the latter being
collections too big to be elements of other
collections, and too big to be sets, say, of ZF.
It also provides an unnervingly powerful
comprehension axiom. B&amp;P, on the other hand, have
at least provisionally adopted !CPU, a surprisingly
weak set theory. Indeed, the vanilla version of
KPU comes without an axiom of infinity and (more or
less hence) has a model in the hereditarily finite
sets. In that setting, even little infinite
collections, like the universe of hereditarily
finite sets, are proper classes, and beyond the
pale. Enough for the moment of set theory,
although we shall have to return to this strange
land for one more brief visit.
More important, and perhaps more disheartening,
similarities silarities are immediately to hand.
Montague and B&amp;P - thus tat - restrict themselves
to the declarative fragment of English; Montague,
for the obvious reason that he was a model theorist
and a student of Tarski. For such types, the
crucial notion to be explicated is that of &amp;quot;truth

of a sentence on an interpretation&amp;quot;. Moreover,
Montague showed no interest in the use(s) of
language. Of course people working within his
tradition are not debarred from doing so; but any
such interest is an extra added attraction. The
same point about model theory, broadly construed,
holds for Barwise-Perry as well; they certainly
aren&apos;t syntacticians. But in their case it is
reinforced by philosophical considerations which
point toward the use of language to convey
information as the central use of language - hence,
to asserting as the central kind of utterance or
speech act. Thus, even when they narrow their
sights to this one use, the notion that language is
something to be put to various uses by humans to
further certain of their purposes is not foreign to
Situation Semantics.*
Second, B&amp;P (again: so far) stop short at the
awesome boundary of the period. Here again, this
was only to be expected; and here again, the
crucial question is whether their overall
philosophical perspective so informs their account
of natural language as to enable a more fruitful
accommodation of work on various aspects of
extended discourse. Barbara Grosz hints at a
suspicion I share, that although at the moment much
of what we have in this regard are promissory notes
and wishful thinking, the answer is in the
affirmative.**

II THE BIG PICTURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988193509433962">
The major point, however, concerns the primary
focus of the work of Barwise and Perry as
contrasted with that of Montague. Montague
approached the problem of the semantics of natural
language essentially as a model theorist,
attempting to apply (newly) orthodox mathematical
techniques to the solution of classical problems in
the semantics of natural languages, many of which
had to do with intensional contexts. After all,
these new techniques - in the development of which
Montague played a role - had precisely to do with
the treatment of formal languages containing modal
and other intensional constructions. What made a
fragment of English of interest to Montague, then,
was that it contained loads of such contexts. It
is as if all of that wondrous machinery, and the
technical brilliance to deploy it, were aimed at an
analysis of the following sentence: yhi
temperature JAI rising. kting
for A. unicorn who was thinkinx entaur.
What is astounding, of course, is that Montague
should have been able to pull a systematic and
rigorous treatment of such contexts out of the
model-theoretic hat.
When we turn to Situation Semantics, on the
other hand, we seem to be back in the linguistic
world of first-grade readers:Sol zan,_ Dick paw
snot min.._ Jane, believed _tha_t S .c Indeed, the
madot concern of Barwise-Perry is not the semantics
of natural language at all. They have bigger
(well, different) fish to fry. First and foremost,
they are concerned with sketching an account of the
place of meaning and mind in the universe, an
account that finds the source of meaning in nomic
regularities among kinds of events (situations),_
regularities which, in general, are independent of
language and mind. For the frying of said fish, a
treatment of cognitive attitudes is essential.
Moreover, and not independently, for any attempt to
apply their overall philosophical picture to the
semantics of natural language, the propositional
attitude contexts pose a crucial and seemingly
insuperable obstacle.*** Hence the fact that the
book Situations and Attitucles precedes Situation
Semantics - the first lays the philosophical
foundations for the second. Thus the origin of
their concern even with the classical problems of
the propositional attitudes is different from
though by no means incompatible with, that of
Montague&apos;s.
Something brief must now be said about th4- hig
picture. Here goes.
The work of B&amp;P can be seen as part of a
continuing debate in philosophy about the source of
the intentionality of the mental - and the nature
of meaning in general; a debate about the right
account to give of the phenomenon of one thing or
event or state-of-affairs being able to represent
(carry information about) another thing or event or
state-of-affairs. On one side stand those who see
the phenomenon of intentionality as dependent on
language - no representation without notation. This
doctrine is the heart of current orthodoxy in both
philosophy of mind and meta-theory of cognitive
psychology. (See, by way of best example, [5].)
It is also a doctrine widely thought to be
presupposed by the whole endeavor of Artificial
Intelligence.* On another side are those who see
the representational power of language as itself
based on the intentionality of mind.** The striking
thing about Barwise and Perry is that, while they
stand firmly with those who deny that meaning and
intentionality essentially involve language, they
reject the thesis that intentionality and meaning
are essentially mental or mind-involving.
The source of meaning and intentionality is to
be found, rather, in the existence of lawlike
regularities - constraints - among kinds of events.
For Barwise-Perry, the analysis of meaning begins
with such facts as that: smoke means fire or those
soots mean measles. The ground of such facts lies
in the ways of the world; in the regularities
between event types in virtue of which events of
one type can carry information about events of
other types. If semantics is the theory of
meaning, then there is no pun intended in the
application of semantic notions to situations in
which there is no use of language and, indeed, in
which there are no minds.
Meaning&apos;s natural home is the world, for
meaning arises out of the regular relations
that hold among situations, among bits of
reality. We -believe linguistic meaning
should be seen within this general picture
of a world teeming with meaning, a world
full of information for organisms
appropriately attuned to that meaning.***
[3]
There is yet another dimension to the
philosophical debate, one to which Barwise and
Perry often allude:
Some theories stress the power of
language to classify minds, the mental
significance of language, and treat the

classification of (external) events as
derivative....A second approach is to focus
on the external significance of language,
on its connection with the described world
rather than the describing mind. Sentences
are classified not by the ideas they
express, but by how they describe things to
be...Frege adopted a third strategy. He
postulated a third realm, a realm neither
of ideas nor of worldly events, but of
senses. Senses are the &amp;quot;philosopher&apos;s
stone&amp;quot;, the medium that coordinates all
three elements in our equation: minds,
words and objects. Minds grasp senses,
words express them, and objects are
referred to by them....One way of regarding
the crucial notion of intension in possible
world semantics is a development of Frege&apos;s
notion of sense. [3]
Barwise and Perry clearly opt for the second
approach. This is one reason for their concern
with the problems posed by the propositional
attitudes; for it has often been argued that these
contexts doom any attempt at a theory of the second
This is the burden of the dreaded
type.
- a weapon we shall gaze at later. For
the moment, though, I want simply to note the
connection of this dimension with that about the
source and nature of intentionality. Just as (some
particular features of) a particular X-ray carries
information about the individual on which the
machine was trained, e.g., that its leg is broken,
so too does an utterance by the doctor of the
sentence &amp;quot;It&apos;s bone is broken&amp;quot;, in a context in
which that same individual is what&apos;s referred to by
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. One can, of course, learn things about the
X-ray and the X-ray machine as well as about the
poor patient; just so, one can learn things about
the doctor from her utterance. In both cases, the
gaining of this derivative information is grounded
in certain regularities, in the one case
mechanical, optical and electro-magnetic; in the
other, perceptual, cognitive, and social-
conventional. More to the point, in all cases the
central locus of meaning is a relation, a
regularity, between types of situation and the
primary focus of significance is an external event
or event-type.&apos;
Now, alas, for that return to set theory. I
have studiously avoided telling the reader what
situations, events and/or event-types are. Indeed,
I haven&apos;t even said which, if any, of these are
technical terms of Situation Semantics. Later I
shall say enough (I hope) to generate an intuitive
feel for situations; still, I have been speaking
freely of the centrality of relations between
events or between event-types. Set-theoretically-
speaking, such relations are going to be (or be
represented by) collections of ordered-pairs.
Collections, but not sets. These collections are
proper classes relative to KPU; so, j.S, 1111

central to the account are not themselves available

similarity between Montague and Situation
Semantics. Montague wanted a very strong
background theory within which models can be
constructed precisely because he didn&apos;t want to
have to worry about any (size) constraints on such
models. B&amp;P put their money on a very weak set
theory precisely because they want there to be such
constraints; in particular because they want to
erect a certain kind of barrier to the infinite.
Obviously, large issues loom on the horizon; let&apos;s
leave them there.
I want now briefly to discuss 3 major aspects of
Situation Semantics, aspects in which it differs
fairly dramatically from Montague semantics. In
passing, I will at least hint at the
interrelationships among these. Aside from
particular points of difference, remember that in
the background there lurks a general conception of
the use of language and its place in the overall
scheme of things, a conception that is meant to
inform and constrain detailed proposals.

III THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFICIENCY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.879282392857143">
One other respect in which Barwise and Perry are
orthodox is their acceptance of a form of the
Yrinciole Comoositionalitv, the principle that
the meaning of a complex expression is a function
of the meanings of its constituents. This is the
principle that is supposed to explain the
productivity or generativity of languages, and the
ability of finite creatures to master them. But
for Barwise and Perry, an :1: equally
important principle is e the rinc131 the
Oficiencv ot 1 .* This principle is
concerned with the ability of different people at
different times and places and in different
contexts to (re)use the self-same sentence to say
different things - to impart different pieces of
information. So, to adopt their favorite example,
if Mitch now says to me, &amp;quot;You&apos;re dead wrong&amp;quot;, what
he says - what he asserts to be the case - is very
different from what I would say if I were to utter
the very same sentence directed at him.** The very
same sentence is used, &amp;quot;with the same meaning&amp;quot;; but
the message or information carried by its use
differs. Moreover, the difference is
systematically related to differences in the
contexts in which the utterances are made.
Barwise and Perry take this phenomenon, often
called indexicality or token-reflexivity and all
too often localized to the occurrence of particular
words (e.g., &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;that&amp;quot;), to be of the essence of natural languages.
They also note, however, that their relational
account of meaning shows it to be a central feature
of meaning in general.
[T]hat smoke pouring out of the the

specific situation, smoke pouring out of
that very building at that very time, will
never be repeated. The next time we see
smoke pouring out a building, it will be a
new situation, and so will in one sense
mean something else. It will mean that the
building in the new situation is on fire at
the new time. Each of these specific smoky
situations means something, that the
building then and there is on fire. This
is...eyent manim. The meaningful

particulars of this case of it. [3]
Moreover, S&amp;P contend that the fact that modern
formal semantics grew out of a concern with the
language(s) of mathematics has caused those working
within the orthodox model-theoretic tradition
either to ignore or to slight this crucial
feature.*
A preoccupation with the language of
mathematics, and with the seemingly eternal
nature of its sentences, led the founders
of our field to neglect the efficiency of
language. In our opinion this was a
critical blunder, for efficiency lies at
the very heart of meaning. [3]

A. A Little Backaround
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998914324074075">
Sure enough, indexicality gave nightmares to
both Frege and Russell.** It might seem that the
issue of indexicality did not escape Montague&apos;s
attention; and it didn&apos;t. Indeed, as Thomason
says, &amp;quot;As a formal discipline, the study of
indexicals, owes much of its development to
Montague and his students&amp;quot; [22]. (See especially
[10] and [11, 12].) This last is most especially
true with respect to the work of David Kaplan, both
a student and a colleague of Montague&apos;s. For
Kaplan disagreed with Montague precisely about the
extent to which the formal treatment of contexts of
utterances should be accommodated to the treatment
of intensionality via possible worlds. And B&amp;P
start from where Kaplan leaves off. [7, 8]
I shall assume once again the right to be
sketchy: Montague adopted a very narrow stance
towards issues in pragmatics, concerning himself
solely with indexicals and tense and not concerning
himself at all with other issues about the purposes
of speakers and hearers and the corresponding uses
of sentences.*** In addition, the treatment of
formal pragmatics was to follow the lead of formal
semantics: the central notion to be investigated
was that of truth of a sentence, but now relative
to both an interpretation and a context of use or
point of reference. (See [10, 11, 12, 18].) The
&amp;quot;working hypothesis&amp;quot; was that one could and should
give a thoroughly uniform treatment of indexicality
within the model-theoretic framework deployed for
the treatment of the indexical-free constructions.
Thus, for example, in standard quantificational
theory, one of the &amp;quot;parameters&amp;quot; of an
interpretation is a domain or universe of
discourse; in standard accounts of modal languages,
another parameter is a set of possible worlds; in
tense logics, a set of points of time. Why stop
there? It is clear when we get to indexicals that
the three parameters I&apos;ve just mentioned aren&apos;t
sufficient to determine a function to truth-values.
Just think of two simultaneous utterances of &amp;quot;You
are dead wrong&amp;quot; in the same world, with all other
*Barbara Grosz hints at agreement with this
judgment. &amp;quot;[O]ne place that situation semantics is
more compatible with efforts in natural-language
processing than previous approaches [is that]
context and facts about the world participate at
two points: (1) in interpretation, for determining
such things as who the speaker is, the time of
utterance..; (2) in evaluation, for determining
such things as. .whether the relationships expressed
in the utterance hold.&amp;quot;
**For the former, see [14], see also [15].
***Stalnaker is a wonderful example of someone
working within the Montague tradition who does take
the wider issues of pragmatics to heart. See [19].
things equal except speaker and addressee. In the
interests of uniformity, stuff all such parameters
into structures called points of reference, and who
knows how many we&apos;ll need - see [9], where points
of reference are called indices. Then the meaning
of a sentence is a function from points of
references into truth values.
A number of researchers working within the
Montague tradition (in a sense there was vcner)
were unhappy with this particular result of
Montague&apos;s quest for generality; the most important
apostate being Kaplan.* There are complex technical
issues involved in the apostasy, centrally those
involving the interaction of indexical and
intensional constructions - interactions which, at
the very least, cast doubt on the doctrine that the
intensions of expressions are total functions from
the set of points of reference to extensions of the
expression at that point of reference.** The end
result anyway, is the proposal for some type of a
non-uniform two-step account. Montaguesque points
of reference should be broken in two, with possible
worlds (and possibly, moments of time) playing one
role and contexts of use (possibly including
moments of time) another, different, role.
In this scheme, sentences get associated with
functions from contexts of use to propositions and
these in turn are functions from contexts to truth-
values. Contexts, upon &amp;quot;application&amp;quot; to utterances
of sentences, yield determinate propositions;
worlds (world-times) function rather as points of
evaluation, yielding truth values of determinate
propositions.***
MP, however, go beyond Kaplan&apos;s treatment, and
in more than one direction. Crucially, the
treatment of indexicality proper is only one aspect
of the account of efficiency, in some ways, the
least intriguing of the lot. Still, to drive home
the first point: as it is with smoke pouring out of
buildings, so too is it with sentences. The
syntactic and semantic rules of a language,
conventional regularities or constraints, determine
the meaning - the event-type meaning - of a
sentence; features of the context of use of an
utterance of that type get added in to determine
what is actually said with that use. This is the
event meaning of the utterance, also called its
interpretation. Finally, that interpretation can
be evaluated, either in a context which is
essentially the same as the context of use, or some
other; thereby yielding an evaluation of the
utterance, (finally) a truth value.

<bodyText confidence="0.998961347826087">
For IMP, the features of the context of use go
beyond those associated with the presence of
explicit indexical items in the utterance - people
with personal pronouns, places with &amp;quot;locatives&amp;quot;,
times with tense markers and temporal indicators.
In particular they mention two such parameters:
speaker connections and resource situations. Some
aspects of the former can be looked on as aspects
of indexicality, following the lines of Kaplan&apos;s
treatment of demonstratives. But in other
respects, e.g., the treatment of proper names, and
certainly in the treatment of resource situations,
the view they sketch seems to transcend the
boundaries of even deviant model-theoretic
semantics. For they mean to do justice, within a
unified and systematic framework, both to the fact
that the meaning of an utterance type

&amp;quot;underdetermines&amp;quot; the interpretation of an
utterance of that type and to the fact the
interpretation of an utterance &amp;quot;underdetermines&amp;quot;
the information that can be imparted by that
utterance. It is a constraint they impose on
themselves that they be able to account for
significant regularities with respect to &amp;quot;the flow
of information&amp;quot;, in so far as that flow is mediated
by the use of language and in cases where the
information is not determined by a compositional
semantic theory. And such cases are the norm.
Compositionality holds only at the level of event-
type or linguistic meaning. The claim is that
seeing linguistic meaning as a special case of the
relational nature of meaning - that meaning resides
in regularities between kinds of situations
- allows them to produce an account which satisfies
this constraint.

So, let me say something about proper names and
something else about resource situations. Let us
put aside for the moment the semantic type that
poor little &amp;quot;David Israel&amp;quot; gets assigned in [13).
Instead, we shall pretend that it gets associated
with some individual.* But which individual?
Surely with one named &amp;quot;David Israel&amp;quot;; but there are
bunches of such, and many, many more Davids. The
problem of course, is that proper names aren&apos;t
proper.* Just as surely, at the level of
linguistic meaning it makes no sense for me to get
special treatment with respect to my name.***
Still, if you (or I) hear Mitch Marcus, right after
my talk, complaining to someone that &amp;quot;David is dead
wrong&amp;quot;, we&apos;ll know who&apos;s being maligned. Why so?
Because we are aware of the speaker&apos;s connections;
more finely, of the relevant connections in this
instance. At the level of event-type or linguistic
meaning, the contribution of a name is to refer to
an individual of that name.**** On the other hand,
it is a feature of the context of use, that the
speaker of an utterance containing that name is
connected in certain ways to such and such
individual A of that name. Surely Mitch knows lots
of Davids and we might find him saying &amp;quot;David
thinks that David is really dead wrong&amp;quot;. Of
course, he might be talking about someone inclined
to harsh and &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; self-criticism; probably
not.
Just one more thing about names and speaker
connections. I noted above that for B&amp;P, the
interpretation of an utterance event
underdetermines the information carried by that
event. The use of names is a locus of nice
examples of this. It is no part of the
interpretation (event meaning) of Mitch&apos;s complaint
about me that my name is &amp;quot;David&amp;quot;; but someone who
saw him say this while he (Mitch, that is) was
surreptitiously looking my way can learn that my
name is &amp;quot;David&amp;quot;, or even that I am the David Israel
who gave the talk on Situation Semantics. Even
without that, someone could learn that Mitch knows
(is connected with) at least one person so named.
(Of course, there are possibilities for
&amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; here, too.) Just so, when I

aside, the central point is that Situation
Semantics is meant to give us an account in which
we can explain and predict such regularities in the
flow of information as that exploited by the
convention of introductions. This account must show
how such regularities are related to the
conventional regularities that determine the
linguistic meaning of sentence types and the
patterns of contextual determination which then
generate the meanings of particular utterance

D. Definite Descriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962230769231">
An analogue of the problem of the impropriety of
talk of proper names arises with respect to
definite descriptions. Take a wild and wooly
sentence such as &amp;quot;The dog is barking&amp;quot;. Again, we
want the denotations of such definite descriptions
to be just plain individuals; but again, which
individuals? Surely, there is more than one dog in
the world; does the definite description fail to
refer because of non-uniqueness? Hardly; at the
level of sentence meaning, there is no question of
it&apos;s referring to some one individual dog. Rather
we must introduce into our semantic account a
parameter for a set of resource situations.
Suppose, for &apos; instance, that we have fixed a
speaker, an audience and a (spatio-temporal)
location of utterance of our sentence. These three
are the main constituents of the parameter B&amp;P call
a discourse situation; note that this one parameter
pretty much covers the contextual features
Montague-Kaplan had in mind. Suppose also that a
dog otherwise unknown to our speaker and his/her
audience, just walked by the front porch, on which
our protagonists are sitting. When the speaker
utters the sentence, he/she is exploiting a
situation in which both speaker and audience saw a
lone dog stroll by; he/she is not describing either
that particular recent situation or such a
situation-type - there may have been many such; the
two of them often sit out on that porch, the
neighborhood is full of dogs. Rather, the speaker
is referring to a situation in which that dog is
barking. Which dog?. The one &amp;quot;contributed&amp;quot; by the
resource situation; the one who just strolled by.
It is an aspect of the linguistic meaning of a
definite description that a resource situation
should enter into the determination of its
reference on a particular occasion of use; thus, an
aspect of the meanings of sentences that a resource
situation be a a parameter in the determination of
the interpretations (event meanings) of sentential
utterances. Moreover, one can imagine cases where
what is of interest is precisely some feature of
which resource situation a speaker is exploiting on
a particular occasion. And here, too, as in the
case of names or, more generally, of speaker
connections, the claim is that the relational
theory of meaning and the consequent emphasis on
the centrality of the Principle of Efficiency give
Situation Semantics a handle on a range of
regularities connecting uses of languages with
varieties of information that can be conveyed by
such uses.

IV LOGICAL FORM AND ENTAILMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985697545454545">
As we have noted, Barwise and Perry&apos;s treatment
of efficiency goes beyond indexicality and, as
embedded within their overall account, goes well
beyond a Kaplan-Montague theory. An important
theme in this regard is the radical de-emphasizing
of the role of entailment in their semantic theory
and the correlative fixing on statements, not
sentences, as the primary locus of interpretation.
This is yet another way in which B&amp;P go beyond
Kaplan&apos;s forays beyond Montague.
I have said that in standard (or even mildly
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996798">
32
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999133392405064">
deviant) model-theoretic accounts the key notion is
that of truth on an interpretation, or in a model.
Having said this, I might as well say that the key
notion is that of entailment or logical
consequence. A set of sentences S entails a
sentence A iff there is no interpretation on which
all of the sentences in S are true and A is false.
From the purely model-theoretic point of view, this
relation can be thought of as holding not between
sentences, but between propositions (conceived of
as the intensions or meanings of sentences). For
instance, it might be taken to hold between sets of
possible worlds. Still, it is presumed (to put it
mildly) that an important set of such relations
among non-linguistic objects have syntactic
realizations in relations holding among sentences
which express those propositions. Moreover, that
sentences stand in these relations is a function of
certain specifiable aspects of their syntactic type
- their &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot;.
In artificial, logical languages, this
presumption of syntactic realization can be made
more or less good; and anyway, the connections
between, on the one hand, syntactic types and modes
of composition, and semantic values on the other,
must be made completely explicit. In particular,
one specifies a set of expressions as the logical
constants of the language, specifies how to build
up complex expressions by the use of those
constants, operating ultimately on the &amp;quot;non-logical
constants&amp;quot;, and then - ipso facto - one has a
perfectly usable and precise notion of logical
form.
In the standard run of such artificial
languages, sentences (that is: sentence types,
there being no need for a notion of tokens) can be,
and typically are, assigned truth-values as their
semantic values. Such languages do not allow for
indexicality; hence the talk about &amp;quot;eternal
sentences&amp;quot;. The linguistic meaning of such a
sentence need not be distinguished from the
proposition expressed by a particular use of it.*
Once indexicality is taken seriously, one can no
longer attribute truth-values to sentences. (Note
how this way of putting things suggests just the
unification of the treatment of indexicality with
that of modality that appealed to Montague.) One
can still, however, take as central the notion of a
sentence being true in a context on an
interpretation. The main reason for this move is
that it allows one to develop a fairly standard
notion of logical consequence or entailment at the
level of sentences. Roughly, a set of sentences S
entails a sentence A iff for every interpretation
and for every context of use of that
interpretation: if every sentence in S is true in a
given context, then so too is A.
Barwise&amp;Perry are prepared to deemphasize
radically the notion of entailment among sentences.
As they fully realize they must provide a new
notion - a notion of one statement following from
another.
At the very least then, our theory will
seek to account for why the truth of
certain statements follows from the truth
of other statements. This move has several
important consequences...There is a lot of
information available from utterances that
is simply missed in traditional accounts,
accounts that ignore the relational aspect
of meaning...A semantic theory must go far
beyond traditional &amp;quot;patterns of
inference&amp;quot;...A rather startling consequence
of this is that there can be no syntactic
counterpart, of the kind traditionally
sought in proof theory and theories of
logical form, to the semantic theory of
consequence. For consequence is simply not
a relation between purely syntactic
elements.
*Hence part, at least, of the oddity of talk
about using such a language by uttering sentences
thereof.
What&apos;s at stake here? A whole lot, I fear.
First, utterances - e.g., the makings of assertions
- are actions. They are not linguistic items at
all they have no logical forms. Of course, they
typically involve the production of linguistic
tokens, which - by virtue of being of such and such
types - may have such forms. (Typically, but not
always - witness the shaking or nodding of a head,
the winking of an eye, the pointing of a finger,
all in appropriate contexts of use, of com-se.)
Thus, entailment relations among statements
(utterances) can&apos;t be cashed in directly in terms
of relations holding among sentences in virtue of
special aspects of their syntactic shape. Remember
what was said above about the main reason for
opting out of an account based on statements and
for an account based on sentence(type)-in-a-
context. If you don&apos;t remember, let me (and David
Kaplan) remind you:
First, it is important to distinguish an
utterance from a sentence-in-A-context.
The former notion is from the theory of
speech acts, the latter from semantics.*
Utterances take time, and utterances of
distinct sentences can not be simultaneous
(i.e., in the same context). But in order
to develop a logic of demonstratives it
seems most natural to be able to evaluate
several premisses and a conclusion all in
the same context. [8]. (The emphasis by way
of underlining is mine - D.I.)
A logic has to do with entailment and validity;
these are the central semantic notions; sentences
are their linguistic loci. This all sounds
reasonable enough, except of course for that quite
unmotivated presumption that contexts of use can&apos;t
be spatio-temporally extended. And it seems
correspondingly unreasonable when B&amp;P opt out.
[T]he aentence &amp;quot;Socrates is speaking&amp;quot;
does not follow from the sentences &amp;quot;Every
philosopher is speaking&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Socrates is a
philosopher&amp;quot; even though this argument has
the same &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; (on most accounts
of logical form) as [&amp;quot;4 is an integral
multiple of 2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;All integral multiples of
2 are even&amp;quot; (so) &amp;quot;4 is even&amp;quot;.] In the
first place, there is the matter of tense.
At the very least the three sentences would
have to be said at more or less the same
time for the argument to be valid.
Sentences are not true or false; only
statements made with indicative sentences,
utterances of certain kinds, are true or
false. [3] (The example is mine - D.I.)
B&amp;P simplify somewhat. It is not required that
all three sentences be uttered simultaneously (by
one speaker). Roughly speaking, what is required
is that the (spatio)temporal locations of their
utterance be close together and that the &amp;quot;sum&amp;quot; of
their locations overlap with that of some utterance
of Socrates. But that isn&apos;t all. The speaker must
be connected throughout to one and the same
individual Socrates, else a pragmatic analogue of
the fallacy of equivocation will result. The same
(or something similar) could be said about the noun
phrase &amp;quot;every philosopher&amp;quot;, for such phrases - just
like definite descriptions - require for their
interpretation a resource situation. One can
imagine a case wherein a given speaker, over a
specified time and at a specified place, connected
to one and the same guy named Socrates, exploits
two different resource situations contributing two
different groups of philosophers, one for each of
*This is what is known in the trade as a
stipulative definition.

<bodyText confidence="0.999870527777778">
the first two utterances. (The case is stronger,
of course, if we substitute for the second sentence
&amp;quot;Socrates is one of the philosophers.&amp;quot;)
It must certainly seem that too much of the baby
is being tossed out with the water; but there are
alleged to be (compensating?) gains:
There is a lot of information available
from utterances that is simply missed in
traditional accounts, accounts that ignore
the relational aspect of meaning. If
someone comes up to me and says &amp;quot;Melanie
saw a bear.&amp;quot; I may learn not just that
Melanie saw a bear, but also that the
speaker is somehow connected to Melanie in
a way that allows him to refer to her using
&amp;quot;Melanie&amp;quot;. And I learn that the speaker is
somehow in a position to have information
about what Melanie saw. A semantic theory
must go far beyond traditional &amp;quot;patterns of
inference&amp;quot; to account for the external
significance of language...A semantic
theory must account for how language fits
into the general flow of information. The
capturing of entailments between statements
is just one aspect of a real theory of the
information in an utterance. We think the
relation theory of meaning provides the
proper framework for such a theory. By
looking at linguistic meaning as a relation
between utterances and described
situations, we can focus on the many
coordinates that allow information to be
extracted from utterances, information not
only about the situation described, but
also about the speaker and her place in the
world. [3]

<bodyText confidence="0.999701684210527">
Despite the heroic sentiments just expressed,
UP scarcely eschew sentences, a semantic account
account of which they are, after all, aiming to
provide. In the formal account statements get
represented by n-tuples (of course), one element of
which is the sentence uttered; and if you like, it
is the sentence-under-syntactic-analysis. (This
last bit is misleading, but not terribly.) Other
elements of the tuple are a discourse situation and
set of speaker connections and resource situations.
Anyway, there is the sentence. Given that, how
about their logical forms?
Before touching on that issue, let me raise
another and related feature of the account. This
is the decision of B&amp;P to let English sentences be
the domain of their purely compositional semantic
functions. For Montague, the &amp;quot;normal form&amp;quot;
semantic interpretation of English went by way of a
translation from English into some Az now &amp;quot;fairly
standard&amp;quot; logical language. (Such languages became
fairly standard largely due to Montague&apos;s work.)
Montague always claimed that this was merely a
pedagogical and simplifying device; and he provides
an abstract account of how a &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; semantic
interpretation would go. Still, his practice
leaves one with the taste of a search for hidden
logical forms of a familiar type underlying the
grammatical forms of English sentences. No such
intermediate logical language is forthcoming in
Situation Semantics. First there is ALIASS:
An Artificial Language for Illustrating
Aspects of Situation Semantics.., has more
of the structure of English than any other
artificial language we know, but it does
not pretend to be a fragment of English, or
any sort of &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; of English. It
is just what its name implies and nothing
more.
Next, and centrally, there is English. The
decision to present a semantic theory of English
directly may make the end product look even more
different than it is. It certainly has the effect
of depriving us of those familiar structures for
which familiar &amp;quot;theorem provers&amp;quot; can be specified,
and thus reinforces the sense of loss for seekers
after a certain brand of entailments. Some may
already feel the tell tale symptoms of withdrawal
from an acute addiction.
There is, however, more to it than that - or
maybe the attendant liberation is enough. For
instance, are English quantifiers logical
constants, and if so, which ones? Which English
quantifiers correspond to which &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot;
quantifiers?* Is there really a sentential negation
operator in English? Well, surely &amp;quot;It is not the
case that&amp;quot; seems to qualify; but how about &amp;quot;not&amp;quot;?
And how about conjunction?
Consider, for example, a statement made
with the sentence (1) Joe admires Sarah and
she admires him. Let us confine our
attention to the utterances in which (1)
has the antecedent relations indicated by
(1&apos;) Joe-1 admires Sarah-2 and she-2
admires him-1. While sentence (1) is a
conjunction of two sentences, a statement
made with (1) in the way [with the
connections - D.I.] indicated by (1&apos;) is
not a conjunction of independent
statements. [31
In general if u1 and u2 are two statements with
the same discourse situations and connections (and
resource situations?), some sense can be made out
of a [sic] conjunctive or [sic] disjunctive
statement, with u1 and u2 as &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot;. But this is
not true of arbitrary statements. Moreover, as in
the case above, if we have a [sic] conjunctive
statement, there may be no coherent decomposition
of it into two independent statements. Talk of
conjunctive and especially of disjunctive
statements is likely to be wildly misleading. For
the latter suggests, quite wrongly, that the
utterer is either asserting one &amp;quot;disjunct&amp;quot; or the
other. &amp;quot;A statement made using a disjunctive
sentence is not the disjunction of two separate
statements.&amp;quot; ( [3].)
In an appendix to &amp;quot;Situations and Attitudes&amp;quot;,
B&amp;P suggest an analogue of propositional logic for
statements within a very simple fragment of ALIASS.
There is no (sentential) negation and no
conditional; but more to the point, there are no
unrestricted laws of statement entailment, e.g.,
between an arbitrary &amp;quot;conjunctive statement&amp;quot; and
its two &amp;quot;conjuncts&amp;quot;. Things get even worse when we
add complex noun phrases to the fragment. The mind
boggles.

V THE PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978212">
Here I shall be mercilessly brief.** The
conventional wisdom, from Frege through to its
logical culmination in Montague, has been that
propositional attitude constructions are
&amp;quot;referentially opaque&amp;quot;; more particularly, that
substitution of co-designative singular terms
within them does not preserve the truth-value of
the whole. Within that orthodoxy there has been
disagreement as to whether they are also
hyperintensional; that is, as to whether
*See [1] passim; but especially the first two

issues involved, and partly because of the
availability of the relevant texts, it has been
their treatment of the propositional attitude

philosophers. This is unfortunate; so I intend to
do my part, by somewhat underplaying this whole
tangle.

substituting necessarily co-designative terms or
logically equivalent sentences within them
preserves truth-value. Montague himself thought
they were not hyperintensional; but he countenanced
the other view. (And sketched an account to handle
it.) Barwise and Perry have the unique distinction
of believing that said contexts are al least
intensional and yet transparent to substitution of
singular terms.* This position is both solitary and
thought to be incoherent. If it were in fact
untenable, that would be most unfortunate for them,
as it is also more or less mandated by their
adopting an approach centered on the external
significance of language.
Indeed, there is supposed to be a proof that it
is incoherent. The argument in question, which
B.O. call the slingshot, is sometimes supposed to
show that all sentences with the same truth-value
must designate the same thing; and hence of
course that truth-values must be the primary
semantic values of sentences. More usually and
somewhat more technically, it has been supposed to
show that if a sentential context allows
substitution of logically equivalent sentences and
co-designating definite descriptions salva
veritate, then that context must be truth-
functional. More clearly: that all modes of
sentence composition are truth-functional unless
they&apos;re opaque. That is, the only contribution
made by a sentence, so embedded, to the whole can
be its truth-value.
In fact, the slingshot is not a &amp;quot;knockdown
proof&amp;quot;; that it is not is recognized by many of its
major slingers(?). (See, for instance, [16, 17].)
Instead, in all of its forms, it rests on some form
or other of two critical assumptions:
1. logically equivalent sentences are
intersubstitutable in all contexts salve
veritate; or, such sentences have the
same semantic value
2. the semantic value of a sentence is
unchanged when a component singular term
is replaced by another, co-referential
singular term.
B&amp;P reject the assumptions that underlie the
slingshot. Here, too, especially with respect to
the second assumption, tricky technical issues
about the treatment of singular terms - both simple
and complex - in a standard logic with identity are
involved. S&amp;P purposefully ignore these issues.
They are interested in English, not in sentences of
a standard logic with identity; and anyway, those
very same issues actually get &amp;quot;transformed&amp;quot; into
precisely the issues about singular terms they do
discuss, issues having to do with the distinction
between referential and attributive uses of
(complex) singular terms. (See their discussion in
[2] and chapter 7 of [3].) To show my strength of
character, I&apos;m not going to discuss the sexy issue
of transparency to substitution of singular terms
- except to say that, like Montague, B&amp;P want a
uniform treatment of singular terms as these occur
both inside and outside of propositional attitude
contexts; and that they also want to have it that
the denotations of such terms are just plain
individual objects. (How perverse!) Rather, I
want to look briefly at the first assumption about
*There is a class of exceptions to this, but I
want not to get bogged down in details here.
logical equivalence.**
A. The Belatiorl Theory ol:Aaning
With respect to the end-result, what&apos;s crucial
is that B&amp;P reject the alleged central consequence
of the slingshot: that the primary semantic value
of a sentence is its truth-value. Of course, given
what we have already said, a better way to pUG this
is that for them, although statements are bearers
of truth-values, the primary semantic value of a
statement is not its truth value.
That honor is accorded to a collection of
situations or events. Very roughly, the story goes
like this: the syntactic and semantic rules of the
language associate to each sentence type a type of
situations or states-of-affairs; intuitively, the
type actualizations of which would be accurately,
though partially, described by any statement made
using the sentence.* Thus:
Consider the sentence &amp;quot;I am sitting&amp;quot;.
Its meaning is, roughly, a relation that
holds between an utterance u and a
situation I just in case there is a
(spatio-temporal) location j and an
individual a„ .&amp; is speaking at I and in A,
A is sitting at I.... The extension of this
relation will be a large class of pairs of
abstract situations. [3].
Now consider a particular utterance of that
sentence, say by Mitch, at a specific location I&apos;.
Then any situation that has [Mitch]
sitting at 1: will be an interpretation of
the utterance. An utterance usually
describes lots of different situations, or
at any rate partially describes them.
Because of this, it is sometimes useful to
think of the interpretation as the class of
such situations. Then we can say that the
situations appearing in the interpretation
of our utterance vary greatly in how much
they constrain the world...When uttered on
a specific occasion, our sentence
constrains the described situation to be a
certain way, to be like one of the
situations in the interpretation. Or, one
might say, it constrains the described
situation to be one of the interpretations.

indexical elements. And remember if B&amp;P are right,
there is an element of &amp;quot;indexicality&amp;quot; in the use of
proper names. If Mitch believes that David is dead
wrong and I&apos;m (that) David, then Mitch believes
that I&apos;m dead wrong. If Mitch believes that I&apos;m

Consider the two sentences: (1) Joe eats and (2)
Joe eats, and Sarah sleeps or Sarah doesn&apos;t sleep.
Let&apos;s grant that (1) and (2) are logically
equivalent. But do they have the same &amp;quot;referent&amp;quot;
or semantic value?
If we think that sentences stand for
situations. .then we will not be at all
inclined to accept the first principle
required in the slingshot. The two
logically equivalent sentences just do not
have the same subject matter, they do not
describe situations involving the same
objects and properties. The first sentence
will stand for all the situations in which
Joe eats, the second sentence for those
situations in which Joe eats and Sarah
sleeps plus those in which Joe eats and
Sarah doesn&apos;t sleep. Sarah is present in
all of these. Since she is not present in
may of the situations that &amp;quot;Joe eats&amp;quot;
stands for, these sentences, though
logically equivalent, do not stand for the
same entity. (Obviously S&amp;P are here
ignoring the &amp;quot;indexicality&amp;quot; inherent in
proper uses of proper names - D.I.) [3]
Notice that without so much as a glance in the
direction of a single propositional attitude
context, we can see how S&amp;P can avoid certain well-
known troubles that plague the standard model-
theoretic treatments of such constructions.*
Moreover and most importantly, they gain these fine
powers of discrimination among &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; without
following either Frege into a third realm of sense
or Fodor (?) deep into the recesses of the mind.
The significance of sentences, even as they occur

What&apos;s the bottom line? Clearly, it&apos;s too soon
to say. Indeed, I assume many of you will simply
want to wait until you can look at least at some
treatment of some fragment of English. Others
would like as well to get some idea of how the
project of Situation Semantics might be realized
computationally. For instance, it is clear even
from what little I&apos;ve said that the semantic values
of various kinds of expression types are going to
be quite different from the norm and much thought
will be needed to specify a formalism for
representing and manipulating these representations
adequately. Again, wouldn&apos;t it be nice to be told
something at least about the metaphysics of
Situation Semantics, about situations, abstract,
actual, factual and real - all four types figure in
some way in the account; about events, event-types,
courses-of-events, schema, etc? Yes it would be
nice. Some, no doubt, were positively lusting
after the scoop on how IMP handle the classic
puzzles of intensionality with respect to singular
terms. And so on. All in good time.
What I want to do, instead, is to end with a
claim, Barbara Grosz&apos;s claim in fact, that
*On this point, compare, e.g., [221. I do not
mean to imply that there aren&apos;t good reasons for
denying the hyperintensionality of the
propositional attitudes. There are. See [21]
Still, no one doubts that such a position is
counter-intuitive.
**Actually, there is another big issue looming
here, the one that hangs on B&amp;P&apos;s opting for a
treatment which takes properties and relations,
intensionally conceived as primitive - instead,
that is, of pretending that properties are
functions from &amp;quot;possible worlds&amp;quot; into sets. Sets,
of course, there are; but so too are there
properties.
attention should be paid. At the moment, the
bottom line with respect to Situation Semantics is
not, I think, to be arrived at by toting up
technical details, as bedazzling as these will
doubtless be. Rather, it is to be gotten at by
attention precisely to THE BIG PICTURE.
The relational theory of meaning, and more
broadly, the centrality in Situation Semantics of
the &amp;quot;flow of information&amp;quot; - the view that that part
of this flow that is mediated by the uses of
language should be seen as &amp;quot;part and parcel of the
general flow of information that uses natural
meaning&amp;quot; - allows reasoned hope for a theoretical
framework within which work in pragmatics and the
theory of speech acts, as well research in the
theory of discourse, can find a proper place. In
many of these areas, there is an abundance of
insight, harvested from close descriptive analyses
of a wide range of phenomena - a range hitherto
hidden from both orthodox linguists and
philosophers. There are now even glimmerings of
regularities. But there has been no overarching
theoretical structure within which to systematize
these insights and those scattered regularities,
and through which to relate them to the results of
syntactic and formal semantic analyses. Situation
Semantics may help us in developing such a
framework.
This last is a good point at which to stop; so I
shall.

If semantics is the theory of meaning, then there is no pun intended in the application of semantic notions to situations in which there is no use of language and, indeed, in which there are no minds. Meaning&apos;s natural home is the world, for meaning arises out of the regular relations that hold among situations, among bits of reality. We -believe linguistic meaning should be seen within this general picture of a world teeming with meaning, a world full of information for organisms appropriately attuned to that meaning.*** [3] There is yet another dimension to the philosophical debate, one to which Barwise and Perry often allude: Some theories stress the power of language to classify minds, the mental significance of language, and treat the ***/ shall return to this theme below. *Who knows?

He postulated a third realm, a realm neither of ideas nor of worldly events, but of senses. Senses are the &amp;quot;philosopher&apos;s stone&amp;quot;, the medium that coordinates all three elements in our equation: minds, words and objects. Minds grasp senses, words express them, and objects are referred to by them....One way of regarding the crucial notion of intension in possible world semantics is a development of Frege&apos;s notion of sense.

This is one reason for their concern with the problems posed by the propositional attitudes; for it has often been argued that these contexts doom any attempt at a theory of the second This is the burden of the dreaded type. - a weapon we shall gaze at later.

[3] Moreover, S&amp;P contend that the fact that modern formal semantics grew out of a concern with the language(s) of mathematics has caused those working within the orthodox model-theoretic tradition either to ignore or to slight this crucial feature.* A preoccupation with the language of mathematics, and with the seemingly eternal nature of its sentences, led the founders of our field to neglect the efficiency of language. In our opinion this was a critical blunder, for efficiency lies at the very heart of meaning. [3] A. A Little Backaround Sure enough, indexicality gave nightmares to both Frege </context>

At the very least the three sentences would have to be said at more or less the same time for the argument to be valid. Sentences are not true or false; only statements made with indicative sentences, utterances of certain kinds, are true or false. [3] (The example is mine - D.I.) B&amp;P simplify somewhat. It is not required that all three sentences be uttered simultaneously (by one speaker). Roughly speaking, what is required is that the (spatio)temporal locations of their utterance be close together and that the &amp;quot;sum&amp;quot; of their locations overlap with that of some utterance of Socrates. But that isn&apos;t all. The speaker must be connected throughout to one and the same individual Socrates, else a pragmatic analogue of the fallacy of equivocation will result.

The capturing of entailments between statements is just one aspect of a real theory of the information in an utterance. We think the relation theory of meaning provides the proper framework for such a theory. By looking at linguistic meaning as a relation between utterances and described situations, we can focus on the many coordinates that allow information to be extracted from utterances, information not only about the situation described, but also about the speaker and her place in the world. [3] A. Mild Anti-Climax? Despite the heroic sentiments just expressed, UP scarcely eschew sentences, a semantic account account of which they are, after all, aiming to provide. In the formal account statements get represented by n-tuples (of course), one element of which is the sentence uttered; and if you like, it is the sentence-under-syntactic-analysis. (This last bit is misleading, but not terribly.) Other elements of the tuple are a discourse situation and set of speaker connections and resource situations. Anyway, there is the sentence.

Talk of conjunctive and especially of disjunctive statements is likely to be wildly misleading. For the latter suggests, quite wrongly, that the utterer is either asserting one &amp;quot;disjunct&amp;quot; or the other. &amp;quot;A statement made using a disjunctive sentence is not the disjunction of two separate statements.&amp;quot; ( [3].) In an appendix to &amp;quot;Situations and Attitudes&amp;quot;, B&amp;P suggest an analogue of propositional logic for statements within a very simple fragment of ALIASS. There is no (sentential) negation and no conditional; but more to the point, there are no unrestricted laws of statement entailment, e.g., between an arbitrary &amp;quot;conjunctive statement&amp;quot; and its two &amp;quot;conjuncts&amp;quot;.

Its meaning is, roughly, a relation that holds between an utterance u and a situation I just in case there is a (spatio-temporal) location j and an individual a„ .&amp; is speaking at I and in A, A is sitting at I.... The extension of this relation will be a large class of pairs of abstract situations. [3]. Now consider a particular utterance of that sentence, say by Mitch, at a specific location I&apos;. Then any situation that has [Mitch] sitting at 1: will be an interpretation of the utterance. An utterance usually describes lots of different situations, or at any rate partially describes them.

On one side stand those who see the phenomenon of intentionality as dependent on language - no representation without notation. This doctrine is the heart of current orthodoxy in both philosophy of mind and meta-theory of cognitive psychology. (See, by way of best example, [5].) It is also a doctrine widely thought to be presupposed by the whole endeavor of Artificial Intelligence.* On another side are those who see the representational power of language as itself based on the intentionality of mind.** The striking thing about Barwise and Perry is that, while they stand firmly with those who deny that meaning and intentionality essentially involve language, they reject the thesis that intentionality and meaning are essentially mental or mind-involving.

Indeed, as Thomason says, &amp;quot;As a formal discipline, the study of indexicals, owes much of its development to Montague and his students&amp;quot; [22]. (See especially [10] and [11, 12].) This last is most especially true with respect to the work of David Kaplan, both a student and a colleague of Montague&apos;s. For Kaplan disagreed with Montague precisely about the extent to which the formal treatment of contexts of utterances should be accommodated to the treatment of intensionality via possible worlds. And B&amp;P start from where Kaplan leaves off. [7, 8] I shall assume once again the right to be sketchy: Montague adopted a very narrow stance towards issues in pragmatics, concerning himself solely with indexicals and tense and not concerning himself at all with other issues about the purposes of speakers and hearers and the corresponding uses of sentences.*** In addition, the treatment of formal pragmatics was to follow the lead of formal semantics: the central notion to be investigated was that of truth of a sentence, but now relative to both an interpretation and a context of use or point of reference.

If you don&apos;t remember, let me (and David Kaplan) remind you: First, it is important to distinguish an utterance from a sentence-in-A-context. The former notion is from the theory of speech acts, the latter from semantics.* Utterances take time, and utterances of distinct sentences can not be simultaneous (i.e., in the same context). But in order to develop a logic of demonstratives it seems most natural to be able to evaluate several premisses and a conclusion all in the same context. [8]. (The emphasis by way of underlining is mine - D.I.) A logic has to do with entailment and validity; these are the central semantic notions; sentences are their linguistic loci. This all sounds reasonable enough, except of course for that quite unmotivated presumption that contexts of use can&apos;t be spatio-temporally extended. And it seems correspondingly unreasonable when B&amp;P opt out. [T]he aentence &amp;quot;Socrates is speaking&amp;quot; does not follow from the sentences &amp;quot;Every philosopher is speaking&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Socrates is a philosopher&amp;quot; even though this argument has the same &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; (on most accounts of log</context>

For they mean to do justice, within a unified and systematic framework, both to the fact that the meaning of an utterance type *See [7, 8]. Others included Stalnaker and Kamp. See [19, 20] and [6]. **The extension appropriate to sentences and clauses being truth values. ***There is even a version of this called &amp;quot;twodimensional modal logic&amp;quot; [20]. 31 &amp;quot;underdetermines&amp;quot; the interpretation of an utterance of that type and to the fact the interpretation of an utterance &amp;quot;underdetermines&amp;quot; the information that can be imparted by that utterance. It is a constraint they impose on themselves that they be able to account for significant regularities with respect to &amp;quot;the flow of information&amp;quot;, in so far as that flow is mediated by the use of language and in cases where the information is not </context>

Yes it would be nice. Some, no doubt, were positively lusting after the scoop on how IMP handle the classic puzzles of intensionality with respect to singular terms. And so on. All in good time. What I want to do, instead, is to end with a claim, Barbara Grosz&apos;s claim in fact, that *On this point, compare, e.g., [221.

Sets, of course, there are; but so too are there properties. attention should be paid.

<context position="20001" citStr="[22]" startWordPosition="3276" endWordPosition="3276"> A preoccupation with the language of mathematics, and with the seemingly eternal nature of its sentences, led the founders of our field to neglect the efficiency of language. In our opinion this was a critical blunder, for efficiency lies at the very heart of meaning. [3] A. A Little Backaround Sure enough, indexicality gave nightmares to both Frege and Russell.** It might seem that the issue of indexicality did not escape Montague&apos;s attention; and it didn&apos;t. Indeed, as Thomason says, &amp;quot;As a formal discipline, the study of indexicals, owes much of its development to Montague and his students&amp;quot; [22]. (See especially [10] and [11, 12].) This last is most especially true with respect to the work of David Kaplan, both a student and a colleague of Montague&apos;s. For Kaplan disagreed with Montague precisely about the extent to which the formal treatment of contexts of utterances should be accommodated to the treatment of intensionality via possible worlds. And B&amp;P start from where Kaplan leaves off. [7, 8] I shall assume once again the right to be sketchy: Montague adopted a very narrow stance towards issues in pragmatics, concerning himself solely with indexicals and tense and not concerning hi</context>
