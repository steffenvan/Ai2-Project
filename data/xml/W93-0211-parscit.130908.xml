1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986125">
Early work in text structuring, such as [McK85] and [MT88] showed that texts of all types and
genres seem to be composed of a small number of simple, intuitive units, variously referred to as
rhetorical relations and rhetorical predicates. These two bodies of work differed in whether these
units were best viewed as the bricks or the mortar of text structure, but in either case a small set
of primitives seemed to suffice for all texts.
McKeown showed how a text generation system can make use of these sorts of primitives
to produce coherent, informative texts. However, not long after that, it became obvious that
McKeown&apos;s schematized block-stacking approach to generation compiled out too much information
.about a speaker&apos;s intentional goals in choosing the blocks s/he did, and that more of this information
should be recorded in the process of text structuring to allow for such niceties as flexibility in
answering follow up questions or requests for elaboration. Following this reasoning, [MS911 instead
utilized the more &amp;quot;mortar-centered&amp;quot; approach of BST for text. generation.

2 Text Structure Primitives: A Tool or Side-Effect?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99821004">
However, there is even more to the information-biding nature of McKeown&apos;s schemas than
just intentional structure, which primitive-based text structuring approaches seem to suffer from in
general. They all seem to hide certain &amp;quot;psychological&amp;quot; dynamics which undoubtedly underlie almost
all human linguistic interaction. For example, it is possible that McKeown&apos;s schema for defining
an object might be derivable from more general principles of information processing: Definitions
tend to begin with an identification to give the hearer a default set of attributes in one fell swoop,
then follow that with a shorter list of specific attributes to override those inherited. But even
this approach might not be best schematized, as the following text seems to serve quite well as a
definition:
Q: &amp;quot;What&apos;s a kumquat?&amp;quot;
A: &amp;quot;It&apos;s like a teeny little orange, but really sour.&amp;quot;
This represents yet another technique, not relying upcm inheritance but on the hearer&apos;s world
knowledge, to convey a great amount of attributive information with very few resources. As McK-
eown&apos;s schema.s were only arrived at through a process of text analysis, we know nothing about
exactly what might make a. particular schematized presentation of information effective at any
given time, or how to choose between schematic texts if more than one is possible. No doubt
certain hearers might prefer many examples, or perhaps a particular concept lends itself very well
to analogy, but at present we have no deep understanding as to what would indicate that examples
or analogies are useful.
Further, a reasonable analysis of an existing text can conflate, confuse or obscure the actual
processes that went into composing it with other factors only secondary to the cohesiveness of the
text. As Moore Si Pollack point out in [MP92], there can be non-isomorphic relations between text
spans on different dimensions; we add that it is therefore unclear which of these relations contribute
most to the coherence of the text. It is possible that some relations are really side-effects of others.
In Moore &amp; Pollack&apos;s example,

we can finish the bookshelves tonight.&amp;quot;
there is a right-branching tree of Motivation relations, as well as a. left- branching tree of Condition
relations both structuring this text. However, the Motivation relations seem to be sufficient to
structure this text, for probably the most likely way to motivate someone to do an act is to show
how some desirable state of affairs is conditional on that act (and in fact, this is exactly one type of
plan operator Moore &amp; Swartout&apos;s generation system would use). In this case, the &amp;quot;informational&amp;quot;
relations seem directly dependent on the intuitively more central &amp;quot;presentational&amp;quot; ones. This seems
to suggest that the mere fact that relations appear in text after text in the analysis stage does not
imply that those relations are the most useful tools to plan with.
In fact, this last point seems to be an essential one to explore. Both McKeown and Mann k.
Thompson found regularities in the texts they analyzed, and used these regularities to characterize
coherent texts. But his characterization can only serve as a first approximation. Perhaps they&apos;ve
shown that coherent texts have RST trees or fit certain schemas, but it&apos;s clearly not the case
that schematized texts or ones with RST trees are necessarily well-formed, even if they obey some
additional constraints (e.g., focusing).

3 Choosing Appropriate Instantiations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998989">
In the same way that no theory we know of can guide a search among possible rhetorical
strategies (Analogy, Identification, etc) a,s to their effects on the hearer and appropriateness, the
content of individual relations and predicates are underspecified to such an extent that given a
rich enough knowledge base, a single well-formed rhetorical skeleton could be incarnated with any
amount of suboptimal or inappropriate information ma,king for an inefkctive or incoherent text.
To illustrate, imagine that one&apos;s task is to generate an explanation of the important social
factors leading up to and resulting from the American Civil War. In describing the circumstances
of the start of the war, there are many attitudes, events, and characteristics of the mid-1800&apos;s
we could choose from to achieve setting up the circumstances. Among them, we know about
the tensions between the industrialized North and the agricultural South, institutionalized racism,
perhaps something about the attitudes of the people at the time towards their country a.nd their
lifestyles, and many others. But a. rich knowledge base also contains a lot of information less useful
given our task; the opening up of the Orient to trade with the West, institutionalized discrimination
against women, and perhaps something about style of dress or what a. typical day wa.s like on a
South Carolina plantation. All of these serve as providing circumstantial information, and given
a perfect text from a history book which makes use of some circumstantial information along the
lines of the first set above, it&apos;s quite likely one could find information equally circumstantial along
the lines of the second set, focussing on the very same notions (economics, prejudicial attitu(les, or
some aspect of human interest), but whose use would have impaired the logical flow of the text.
Similarly, in giving Background information about Abra.ham Lincoln, some information such as
his attitudes towards state&apos;s rights and secession, and perhaps his legendary morality and honesty,
must be sifted out of a rich knowledge base at the expense of other information about his mole, his
beard, his childhood, or his clinical depressions, though all are construed as Attributive relations
which focus on Lincoln and in some sense give tlw reader Ba,ckground information about Lincoln.
Such a problem seems to involve calculating relevance, which has not received much attention
as it relates to formal text structure devices like schemas or RST tree construction. An interesting
question, however, is how clearly relevance selection can be divorced from formal structuring. There
is no inherent irrelevance in any information contained in a knowledge base. Given different gross
organizations and aims of the text, like a tale of the Civil War as gothic romance, hoop skirts and
oppression of women might be mentionable within the same text. as descriptions of Southern political

rage, and in writing a. humanistic psychological treatise one can expound at length on Lincoln&apos;s
melancholy and similar attributes where very different attributes were mentioned in the sociological
text. It seems that all these different types of texts share the property that the skeleton of rhetorical
relations are fleshed out with information which is in some way linked to a basic backbone or kernel
of information which organizes the text — the &amp;quot;gist&amp;quot; of the text. If the gist of the text is to give
a sequential historical account of a War, this backbone might, consist of sequential Causes and
Effects, with events and players introduced as they figure in events mentioned, and elaborated
with information which is related not simply in one way to the immediate context, forming a tree,
but perhaps to several parts of the backbone, forming a graph. Thus in a text which aims at a
specifically sociological account of the war, hoop skirts and Lincoln&apos;s mole, though associated in
the knowledge base to aspects of the Civil War, do not relate in any interesting way to other pieces
of information in the gist of the tale and don&apos;t warrant mention, whole his attitudes as a, politician
not only characterize hint a,s personal attributes but also might serve as pointers to why he behaved
as he did or why events unfolded as they did.

4 Where To Go From Here
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998365625">
The rhetorical relations and predicates proposed in the literature, then, are probably best
viewed as approximations to be analyzed at a deeper level. It seenis that the recurring patterns
of relations and predicates that text analysis reveals are best viewed as common linguistic, goal-
satisfaction techniques — techniques for enhancing understanding. Promising directions for future
research in that field would then be along several lines: Discerning the underlying principles that
make rhetorical techniques so useful, discerning the dynamic, situational phenomena which license
the use of these techniques, and discerning what sorts of information best carries out the work of
the techniques in any given text.
For the first tack, we would need to consider the effectiveness and efficiency of the various
techniques. While the systems of Moore &amp; Swartout [Moo89, MS91] and Maybury [May92] try
to incorporate rhetorical techniques into an intentional, goal-oriented framework, they have not
shown how one technique should be chosen above the other when 1)01.11 are possible. Maybury does
not address the issue at all. Moore k, Swartont list, selectioual heuristics which prefer operators
that make the least demands on the hearer, but this very transparent use of the user model is
not sufficient to make the most effective choices. For example, in describing a missing person
to a police officer, the literature suggests such varied options as compare/contrast, attributive
descriptions, analogical descriptions, description by parts. and subparts, and so on. The most
effective options in that situation are probably the attributive (&amp;quot;He&apos;s 5&apos;11&amp;quot;, 190ffis, brown hair,
gray eyes, pale&amp;quot;) and compare/contrast descriptions (&amp;quot;He&apos;s about your build but a. little shorter&amp;quot;),
but to decide this requires some understanding of the principles (perhaps psychological or cognitive)
which underlie the identity of each of the techniques. Efficiency considerations also come into play.
In the current scenario, given a choice between the two most effective techniques, we might prefer
a. compare/contrast description technique if a good candidate for comparison is available. The
rationale might be that comparison to an entity transmits almost all of that entity&apos;s attributes
with a single invocation, and the contrast allows quick overriding of a. few salient attributes.
The second tack, discerning the dynamics of communication which license the use of these
predicates and relations, is intimately related to the first, for the communication situation provides
the impetus for searching for a technique in the first place. The &amp;quot;missing person&amp;quot; scenario above
creates several interacting needs and desires on the parts of the participants. The relation of
rhetorical techniques to these goals needs to be more fully focussed on. Similarly, the situation
establishes a perspective on what is to be said; since the police will want to look for the missing
person, his physical attributes are highlighted by the situation, giving the impulse and facility for
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753259259259">
creating an attributive description or a comparative description highlighting physical features. In
an another example, from Mann 1■z, Thompson,
&amp;quot;What if you&apos;re having to clean floppy drive heads too often? Ask for Syncom diskettes,
with burnished Ectype coating and (hist-absorbing jacket liners...&amp;quot;
the overall relation seems to be one of Solutionhood. However, this relation in and of itself does not
reflect the persuasive nature of the text. It does however reflect more general principles of what a
reader desires from a product (a solution), how to attract the interest of a reader (pose a question
s/he will want an answer to), and so on. A cursory glance through magazine advertisements shows
an unusually large number of ads structured this way, and with very good reason.
And in following the third tack, determining appropriate context, it&apos;s useful to consider a
wider range of texts than seems to have been considered before. We chose here to think about
historical narratives to illustrate how a. very rich knowledge base might confound selection of relevant
information, but at the same time suggest a richer model of coherence based on more than just
recursive, nested constituents. Typical domains in which text structure is studied are task-oriented
in nature or are based on knowledge bases rich in isa-links but little else. To get at a more
fundamental understanding of what factors influence text structure, one should look across many
different text types and seek points of similarity. For example, is there a connection between the
way a well-drawn comparison provides an efficient classification of an item in the hearer&apos;s conlplex
knowledge base and the way a well-chosen set of background information provides support and
explanation for the complex information to come? .
In the end, the inventory of techniques a generation system draws upon will need to be indexable
by these interpersonal dynamics. They will also need to be characterizable hi terms which facil-
itate constructing effective, efficient text. These considerations seem to demand an examination
of rhetorical structures in terms of the mental states of the conversation partners, their perspec-
tives and wants, and also perhaps in terms of the mental structures of the conversation partners,
exploiting how they process analogies, similes, and classifications. In sum, we need to disassemble
the information compiled into rhetorical relations and predicates.
