PREFACE
This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the workshop on Question
Answering in Restricted Domains, which is part of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Association
for Computational Linguistics, held on July 21-26, 2004 in Barcelona, Spain.
Much of the current research in question answering systems is driven by programs such as
AQUAINT and evaluation exercises such as TREC, NTCIR and CLEF, all of which focus on open-
domain question answering. The availability of large volumes of data (e.g. documents extracted
from the World Wide Web) has prompted the development of systems that focus on shallow text
processing.
But there are many document sets in restricted domains that are potentially valuable as a source
for question answering systems. For example, the documentation pages of Unix and Linux systems
would make an ideal corpus for QA systems targeted at users that want to know how to use these
operating systems. There is a wealth of information in other technical documentation such as
software manuals, car maintenance manuals, and encyclopediae of specific areas such as medicine.
Users interested in these specific areas would benefit from QA systems targeted to their areas of
interest.
Restricted domains typically have limited data available and therefore conventional techniques
based on data redundancy can simply not be applied in an effective way. The scarcity of data
available seems to prompt for a more targeted, NLP-intensive approach to QA. The use of additional
corpora such as the WWW raises a number of interesting questions. For instance, will these corpora
help or obstruct the proper functioning of NLP-intensive approach to QA? And, how do we find
good pockets of information that are appropriate to the chosen domains?
On the other hand, restricted domains (e.g. law, medicine) have specific stylistic conventions.
Often these domains use terminology that is not stored in conventional lexica. Consequently NLP
approaches devised for open-domain systems may choke on these specific domains, thus raising the
question of how portable these systems can be.
In this workshop we aim at answering some of the following questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99904675">
• Are open-domain question answering techniques appropriate for QA in restricted domains?
• Can we use generic large corpora and/or the WWW? How can we identify specific pockets
of information in these generic corpora?
• How can we use specific sources such as CIA factbook, acronym lists, e-commerce sites
(e.g., e-bay), and specialized glossaries and encyclopedia? How can we discover new specific
sources?
• What types of question-answering techniques are best for what types of restricted domains?
• Is it easy/possible/worthwhile to develop domain-independent QA systems for restricted
domains? What would be the cost of porting a QA system to other domains?
• Are restricted domains more suitable than open domains to drive research in NLP?
• Is evaluation of restricted-domain QA systems different than that of open-domain QA
systems?

Of the 13 papers submitted, the programme committee selected 8 papers. We are very grateful
to our programme committee for the effort they put in reviewing the full papers. We are also grateful
to the ACL/EACL-2004 conference organisers on whom we could rely for the local organization.
