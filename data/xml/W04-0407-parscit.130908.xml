<bodyText confidence="0.99999216">
This paper describes the representation of
Basque Multiword Lexical Units and the
automatic processing of Multiword
Expressions. After discussing and stating
which kind of multiword expressions we
consider to be processed at the current
stage of the work, we present the
representation schema of the
corresponding lexical units in a general-
purpose lexical database. Due to its
expressive power, the schema can deal
not only with fixed expressions but also
with morphosyntactically flexible
constructions. It also allows us to
lemmatize word combinations as a unit
and yet to parse the components
individually if necessary. Moreover, we
describe HABIL, a tool for the automatic
processing of these expressions, and we
give some evaluation results. This work
must be placed in a general framework of
written Basque processing tools, which
currently ranges from the tokenization
and segmentation of single words up to
the syntactic tagging of general texts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996376371428571">
Most texts are rich in multiword expressions,
which must be necessarily processed if we want
any NLP tool to perform accurately. Jackendoff
(1997) estimates that their number in the speakers&apos;
lexicon “is of the same order of magnitude as the
number of single words”.
There is no agreement among authors about the
definition of the term Multiword Expression.
However, in this article, Multiword Expressions
(hereafter MWE) refer to any word combinations
ranging from idioms, over proper names,
compounds, lexical and grammatical
collocations... to institutionalized phrases. MWEs
comprise both semantically compositional and
non-compositional combinations, and both
syntactically regular and idiosyncratic phrases,
including complex named entities such as proper
nouns, dates and number expressions (see section
2).
In contrast, Multiword Lexical Units (hereafter
MWLU) comprise lexicalized phrases —
semantically non-compositional or syntactically
idiosyncratic word combinations— which are
represented and stored in the lexical database of
Basque (EDBL).
The remaining sections are organized as
follows. Section 2 presents the main features of
MWEs in Basque, and defines which are currently
considered for automatic processing. Section 3
describes the representation of MWLUs in the
lexical database. Section 4 is devoted to the
description and evaluation of the automatic
treatment of MWEs by means of HABIL. Section
5 summarizes future work. And, finally, section 6
outlines some conclusions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999536098039216">
The definition of the term Multiword Expression
and the types of such MWEs to be treated in NLP
may vary considerably depending on the purposes
or &amp;quot;the depth of processing being undertaken&amp;quot;
(Copestake et al., 2002). Multiword itself is a
vague term. At text level, a word could be defined
as &amp;quot;any string of characters between two blanks&amp;quot;
(Fontenelle et al., 1994). This is not applicable to
languages as Japanese, which are typically written
without spaces. Besides, a great number of MWEs
that in uninflected languages would be multiword,
constitute a single typographic unit in agglutinative
languages such as Basque (ziurrenik &apos;most
probably&apos;, aurrerantzean &apos;from now on&apos;, aurretiaz
&apos;in advance&apos;). Therefore, we consider them single
words and they are included in the lexical database
as such (or recognized by means of morphological
analysis).
In our case, when deciding which Basque
MWEs to include in the database, we mostly rely
on lexicographers&apos; expertise since we consider
lexicalized phrases have a top priority for both
lemmatizing and syntactic purposes. So, the
MWEs dealt with in the database comprise fixed
expressions, which admit no morphosyntactic or
internal modification —including foreign
expressions such as in situ, a priori, strictu sensu,
etc.—, idioms, both decomposable and non-
decomposable, and lexicalized compounds. We
also consider light verb constructions when they
are syntactically idiosyncratic.
However, currently we do not treat open
collocations, proverbs, catch phrases and similes.
Mostly, we don&apos;t include proper names in the
database either, since complex named entities are
given a separate treatment. Apart from proper
nouns, also dates and number expressions are
treated separately (see 4.1).
So far we have described 2,270 MWLUs in our
database. This work has been carried out in two
phases. For the first phase, we made use of the
Statistical Corpus of 20th Century Basque
(http://www.euskaracorpusa.net) that contains
about 4.7 million words. As a starting point, we
chose the MWLUs that occurred more than 10
times in this manually lemmatized corpus. This
amounted to about 1,300 expressions. For the
second phase, this list has been enlarged using the
Hiztegi Batua, a dictionary of standard Basque that
the Basque Language Academy updates regularly
(http://www2.euskaltzaindia.net/hiztegibatua).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985517">
2.1 Main features of lexicalized phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942543478261">
Many of the lexicalized phrases are semantically
non-compositional (or partially compositional), i.e.
they can hardly be interpreted in terms of the
meaning of their constituents (adarra jo &apos;to pull
someone&apos;s leg&apos;, literally &apos;to play the horn&apos;).
Often, a component of these sequences hardly
occurs in any other context and it is difficult to
assign it a part of speech. For example, the word
noizik is an archaism of modern noiztik &apos;from
when&apos;, which occurs just in the expressions noizik
behin, noizik behinean, noizik noizera, and noizik
behinka all meaning &apos;once in a while&apos;. Besides, it is
not clear which is the part of speech of the words
laprast in laprast egin &apos;to slip&apos; or dir-dir in dir-dir
egin &apos;to shine&apos;.
From a syntactic point of view, many of these
MWEs present an unusual structure. For example,
many complex verbs in Basque are light verb
constructions, being the meaning of the compound
quite compositional, e.g. lo egin &apos;to sleep&apos; literally
&apos;to make (a) sleep&apos; or lan egin &apos;to work&apos; literally &apos;to
make (a) work&apos;. However, lo egin and lan egin can
be considered &apos;syntactically idiomatic&apos; since the
nouns in these expressions, lo and lan, take no
determiner, which would be completely
ungrammatical for a noun functioning as a regular
direct object (*arroz jan nuen &apos;I ate rice&apos;).
Morphosyntactic flexibility, being significant in
this type of constructions in Basque, may vary
considerably. For example in lo egin &apos;to sleep&apos; the
noun lo admits modification (lo asko egin zuen &apos;he
slept very much&apos;) and may take the partitive
assignment (ez dut lorik egin &apos;I haven&apos;t slept&apos;) while
the verb egin can be subject to focalization (egin
duzu lorik bart? &apos;did you sleep at all last night?&apos;);
besides, the components of the construction may
change positions and some elements and phrases
may be placed between them (mendian egin omen
zuen lasai to &apos;it is said that he slept peacefully in
the mountain&apos;). In contrast, alde egin &apos;to escape&apos; is
morphosyntactically quite rigid. In all the cases,
the verb egin can take any inflection.
For our database, we have worked out a single
representation that covers all MWLUs ranging
from fixed expressions to these of highest
morphosyntactic flexibility.

3 Representation of MWLUs in the lexical
database
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9492152">
In this section we explain how MWLUs are
represented in EDBL (Aldezabal et al., 2001), a
lexical database oriented to language processing
that currently contains more than 80,000 entries,
out of which 2,270 are MWLUs. Among these:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997828">
• —69% are always unambiguous. The average
number of Surface Realization Schemas
(SRS, see section 3.2) is 1.02.
• —23% are sometimes unambiguous and have
3.6 SRSs in average, half of them
ambiguous.
• —8% are always ambiguous and have 1.2
SRSs in average.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959545454546">
We want to point out that almost all of the
unambiguous MWLUs have only one SRS, their
components appearing in contiguous positions and
always in the same order. About half of them are
inflected, so, even if we discard the interpretations
of the components, there is still some
morphosyntactic ambiguity left. However, the
identification of these MWLUs helps in
disambiguation, as the input of tagging is more
precise.
The description of MWLUs within a general-
purpose lexical database must include, at least, two
aspects (see Figure 1): (1) their composition, i.e.
which the components of the MWLU are, whether
each of them can be inflected or not, and according
to which one-word lexical unit (OWLU 1 ) it
inflects; and (2), what we call the surface
realization, that is, the order in which the
components may occur in the text, the mandatory
or optional contiguousness of components, and the
inflectional restrictions applicable to each one of
the components.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998764">
3.1 Composition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988085">
As it has just been said, the description of the
composition of MWLUs in EDBL gathers two
aspects: on the one side, it depicts which the
individual components of a MWLU are; on the
other side, it links the inflectable components of a
MWLU to the corresponding OWLU according to
which each of them inflects.
In Figure 1, we can see that the composed of
relationship links every MWLU to up to 9
individual components (MWLU_Components).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8922300625">
1 We consider OWLUs lexical units with no spaces within its
orthographical form; so, we also take hyphenated compounds
as OWLUs.
Each component is characterized by the following
attributes:
• Component_Position: this indicates
the position of the component word-form in
the canonical form of the MWLU.
Component_Form: i.e. the word-form
itself as it appears in the canonical form of
the MWLU.
• Conveys_Morph_Info?: this is a
Boolean value, indicating whether the
component inflection conveys the
morphological information corresponding to
the whole MWLU or not2.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997484">
Moreover, the components of a MWLU are
linked to its corresponding OWLU (according to
which it inflects). This is represented by means of
the inflects according to relationship
(see Figure 1).

<bodyText confidence="0.982043454545455">
These two aspects concerning the composition
of a MWLU are physically stored in a single table
of the relational database in which EDBL resides.
The columns of the table are the following:
Entry, Homograph_Id, Component_
Position, Component_Form, Conveys_
Morph_Info?, OWLU_Entry, and OWLU_
Homograph_Id. In the example below, the
composition of the MWLU begi bistan egon &apos;to be
evident&apos; is described. Note that one row is used per
component:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.413502">
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 1, begi, -, begi, 2&gt;
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 2, bistan, -, bista, 1&gt;
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 3, egon, +, egon, 1&gt;
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999055">
This expression allows different realizations
such as begi bistan dago &apos;it is evident&apos; (literally &apos;it
is at reach of the eyes&apos;), begi bistan daude &apos;they are
evident&apos;, begien bistan egon, &apos;to be evident&apos;, etc. In
the table rows above, it can be seen that the last
component egon 1 &apos;to be&apos; conveys the
morphological information for the whole MWLU
(+ in the corresponding column).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999568">
3.2 Surface realization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990822">
As for surface realization, we have already
mentioned that the components of a MWLU can
occur in a text either contiguously or dispersed.
Besides, the order of the constituents may be fixed
or not, and they may either inflect or occur in an
invariable form. In the case of inflected
components, some of them may accept any
inflection according to its corresponding OWLU,
whilst others may only inflect in a restricted way.
Moreover, some MWLUs are unambiguous and
some are not, since it cannot be certainly assured
that the very same sequence of words in a text
corresponds undoubtedly to a multiword entry in
every context. For example, in the sentence Emilek
buruaz baiezko keinu bat egin zuen &apos;Emile nodded
his head&apos; the words bat and egin do not correspond
to the complex verb bat egin &apos;to unite&apos; but to two
separate phrases.
According to these features, we use a formal
description where different realization patterns
may be defined for each MWLU. The corresp.
SR schemas relationship in Figure 1 links every
MWLU to one or more Surface_Realiza-
tion_Schemas. Each SRS is characterized by
the following attributes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.82908088">
• Order_Contiguousness: an expression
that indicates both the order in which the
components may appear in the different
instances of the MWLU and the
contiguousness of these components. In
these expressions the position of the digits
indicate the position each component takes
in a particular SRS, * indicates that 0 or
more words may occur between two
components, and ? indicates that at most
one single word may appear between two
given components of the MWLU.
• Unambiguousness: a Boolean value,
indicating whether the particular SRS
corresponds to an unambiguous MWLU or
not. It expresses whether the sequence of
words matching this SRS must be
unambiguously analyzed as an instance of
the MWLU or, on the contrary, may be
analyzed as separate OWLUs in some
contexts.
• Inflection_Restrictions: an
expression that indicates the inflection
paradigm according to which the MWLU
may inflect in this specific SRS. In these
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.951238882352941">
expressions each component of the MWLU
is represented by one list component (in the
same order as the components of the
MWLU appear in its canonical form): %
indicates that the whole inflection paradigm
of the corresponding inflectable component
may occur; the minus sign (-) is used for
non-inflectable components (no inflection at
all may occur); finally, a logical expression
(and, or, and not are allowed) composed
of attribute-value pairs is used to express the
inflectional restrictions and the
morphotactics the component undergoes in
this particular SRS of the MWLU (in
brackets in the examples below).
In the examples below, it can be seen that one
row is used per SRS. The columns of the table are
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.949477">
the following: Entry, Homograph_Id, Or-
der_Contiguousness, Unambiguousness,
and Inflection_Restrictions:
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 123, +,
(((CAS=ABS) and (DEF=-)) or
((CAS=GEN) and (NUM=PL)), -, %)&gt;
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 312, +,
(((CAS=ABS) and (DEF=-)) or
((CAS=GEN) and (NUM=PL)), -, %)&gt;
&lt;begi bistan egon, 0, 3?12, +,
(((CAS=ABS) and (DEF=-)), -, %)&gt;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979072395833333">
The first SRS matches occurrences such as begi
bistan dago hau ez dela aski &apos;it is evident that it is
not enough&apos; or begien bistan zegoen honela
bukatuko genuela &apos;it was evident that we would
end up this way&apos;, where the components are
contiguous and the analysis as an instance of the
MWLU would be unambiguous. This SRS allows
the inflection of the first component as absolutive
case (non-definite) or as genitive (plural), and the
whole set of inflection morphemes of the third one.
The third SRS matches occurrences such as ez
dago horren begi bistan &apos;it is not so evident&apos;, where
the components are not contiguous (at most one
word is allowed between the “third” component
and the “first one”) and they occur in a non-
canonical order: 3?12. In this case, the
interpretation as an instance of the MWLU would
also be unambiguous. However, this SRS only
allows the inflection of the first component as
absolutive case (non-definite).
3.3 Different information requirements in
lemmatization and syntax processing
The first prototype for the treatment of MWEs in
Basque HABIL (Ezeiza et al., 1998; Ezeiza, 2003)
was built for lemmatization purposes. However,
we are nowadays involved in the construction of a
deep syntactic parser (Aduriz et al., 2004) and the
MWEs seem to need a different treatment. The fact
that many MWEs may be syntactically regular but,
above all, that an external element may have a
dependency relation with one of the constituents,
forces us to analyze the elements independently.
For example, in the verb beldur izan &apos;to be afraid
(of)&apos; an external noun phrase may have a modifier-
noun dependency relation with beldur &apos;fear&apos; as in
sugeen beldur naiz &apos;I&apos;m afraid of snakes&apos;. In loak
hartu &apos;to fall asleep&apos; there is a subject-verb relation
as in loak hartu nau &apos;I have fallen asleep&apos;, literally
&apos;sleep has caught me&apos;; therefore subject-auxiliary
verb agreement would fade if both components
were analyzed as one.
The MWLU representation we have adopted
allows us to lemmatize the word combination as a
unit and yet to parse the components individually
whenever necessary. In order to do so, when
describing each MWLU, we specify whether the
elements in the MWLU must be analyzed
separately or not3.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.949164" genericHeader="method">
4 Treatment of multiword expressions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999443083333333">
MWEs could be treated at different stages of the
language process. Some approaches treat them at
tokenization stage, identifying fixed phrases, such
as prepositional phrases or compounds, included in
a list (Carmona et al., 1998; Karlsson et al., 1995).
Other approaches rely on morphological analysis
to better identify the features of the MWE using
finite state technology (Breidt et al., 1996).
Finally, there is another approach that identifies
them after the tagging process, allowing the
correction of some tagging errors (Leech et al.,
1994).
All of these approaches are based on the use of
a closed set of MWLUs that could be included in a
list or a database. However, some groups of MWEs
are not subject to be included in a database,
because they comprise an open class of
expressions. That is the case of collocations,
compounds or named entities. The group of
collocations and compounds should be delimited
using statistical approaches, such as Xtract
(Smadja, 1993) or LocalMax (Silva et al., 1999),
so that only the most relevant—those of higher
frequency— are included in the database.
Named entity recognition task has been solved
for a large set of languages. Most of these works
are linked to the Message Understanding
Conference (Chinchor, 1997). There is a variety of
methods that have been used in NE recognition,
such as HMM, Maximum Entropy Models,
Decision Trees, Boosting and Voted Perceptron
(Collins, 2002), Syntactic Structure based
approaches and WordNet-based approaches
(Magnini et al., 2002; Arévalo, 2002). Most
references on NE task might be accessed at

4.1 Processing MWEs with HABIL
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.909933111111111">
We have implemented HABIL, a tool for the
treatment of multiword expressions (MWE), based
3 Currently we are studying the MWLUs in the lexical
database in order to determine which of them deserve to be
parsed as separate elements. We have not defined yet how this
will be formally represented in the database.
on the features described in the lexical database.
The most important features of HABIL are the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97128475">
• It deals with both contiguous and split
MWEs.
• It takes into account all the possible orders
of the components (SRS).
• It checks that inflectional restrictions are
complied with.
• It generates morphosyntactic interpretations
for the MWE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967542857143">
This tool has two different components: on the
one hand, there is a searching engine that identifies
MWEs along the text, and, on the other hand, there
is a morphosyntactic processor that assigns the
corresponding interpretations to the components of
the MWE.
The morphosyntactic processor generates the
interpretations for MWEs using category and
subcategory information in the lexical database.
When one of the components adds information to
the MWE, the processor applies pattern-matching
techniques to extract the corresponding
morphological features of the analyses of that
component, and these features are included in the
interpretation of the MWE. Then, it replaces all the
morphosyntactic interpretations of the components
of unambiguous MWEs with the MWE
interpretations. When MWEs are ambiguous, the
new interpretations are added to the existing ones.
HABIL also identifies and treats dates and
numerical expressions. As they make up an open
class, they are not obviously included in the lexical
database. Furthermore, their components are
always contiguous, have a very strict structure, and
use a closed lexicon. Thus, it is quite easy to
identify them using simple finite state transducers.
For the morphosyntactic treatment of dates and
numerical expressions, we use the morphosyntactic
component of HABIL. These expressions may
appear inflected and, in this case, the last
component adds morphosyntactic features to the
MWE. Finally, as they are unambiguous
expressions, the processor discards the
interpretations of the components and assigns them
all the interpretations of the whole expression.

We performed several experiments using 650
unambiguous, contiguous and ordered MWEs. We
treated a reference corpus of around 36,000 tokens
and there were 386 instances of 149 different
MWEs. We also applied this process to a small test
corpus of around 7,100 tokens in which there were
87 instances of 45 MWEs. Taking both corpora
into account, there were 473 instances of 167
different MWEs, which amounted to 25% of the
expressions considered, and 50% of the instances
were ambiguous. Besides, only 14 dates and 12
numerical expressions were found in the reference

<bodyText confidence="0.999970961538462">
After confirming the viability of the system and the
good results in POS tagging, our main goal is to
increase the number of MWLUs in the database,
which will improve the identification of MWEs in
corpora.
A remaining difficulty that we are facing is the
problem of ambiguous split MWEs. At present, we
are creating a disambiguation grammar that will
discard or select the multiword interpretations in
ambiguous MWLUs. We are developing similar
rules using both the Constraint Grammar
formalism and finite state transducers (XFST tools,
Kartunnen et al. 1997). The very first rules seem to
be quite effective. Soon, we will be assessing the
first results, and then we will be able to choose the
method that performs best with a lesser effort.
Once we have chosen the best formalism, we
intend to develop a comprehensive grammar that
will disambiguate as many ambiguous MWLUs as
possible.
In addition, we are developing new processes
after POS tagging in order to identify complex
named entities and terminological units. These
units constitute an open class and so their
exhaustive inclusion in a database would not be
viable.

In this paper we have described a whole
framework for the representation and treatment of
MWEs, which is being currently used at the IXA
Research Group to process this kind of expressions
in general texts. Although it has been conceived
and so far used for Basque, a highly inflected
language, we think that it is general enough to be
applied to other languages.
A general representation schema for MWLUs at
the lexical level has been proposed. This schema
allows us to state which components a MWLU has
and to formally encode all the different surface
realizations it can adopt in the text.
The problems that diverse information require-
ments in lemmatization and syntactic processing
can eventually pose have been explained, and a
possible solution for the representation of these
phenomena has also been outlined.
As for the processing aspects, we have
described HABIL, the tool for the treatment of
MWEs. HABIL processes MWEs based on their
description in the lexical database, dealing also
with some types of open class MWEs.
One of the remaining problems when split and
ambiguous MWEs are to be tagged is related with
disambiguation procedures using Hidden Markov
Models, which are not able to manage different
paths with variable lengths. This problem can be
solved using rule-based methods or lattice
structures for tagging.

<abstract confidence="0.998452884615385">This paper describes the representation of Basque Multiword Lexical Units and the automatic processing of Multiword Expressions. After discussing and stating which kind of multiword expressions we consider to be processed at the current stage of the work, we present the representation schema of the corresponding lexical units in a generalpurpose lexical database. Due to its expressive power, the schema can deal not only with fixed expressions but also with morphosyntactically constructions. It also allows us to lemmatize word combinations as a unit and yet to parse the components individually if necessary. Moreover, we describe HABIL, a tool for the automatic processing of these expressions, and we give some evaluation results. This work must be placed in a general framework of written Basque processing tools, which currently ranges from the tokenization and segmentation of single words up to the syntactic tagging of general texts.</abstract>

However, this SRS only allows the inflection of the first component as absolutive case (non-definite). 3.3 Different information requirements in lemmatization and syntax processing The first prototype for the treatment of MWEs in Basque HABIL (Ezeiza et al., 1998; Ezeiza, 2003) was built for lemmatization purposes. However, we are nowadays involved in the construction of a deep syntactic parser (Aduriz et al., 2004) and the MWEs seem to need a different treatment. The fact that many MWEs may be syntactically regular but, above all, that an external element may have a dependency relation with one of the constituents, forces us to analyze the elements independently. For example, in the verb beldur izan &apos;to be afraid (of)&apos; an external noun phrase may have a modifiernoun dependency relation with beldur &apos;fear&apos; as in sugeen beldur naiz &apos;I&apos;m afraid of snakes&apos;. In loak hartu &apos;to fall asleep&apos; there is a subject-verb relation as in loak hartu nau &apos;I have fallen asleep&apos;, literally &apos;sleep has caught me&apos;; therefore s</context>

For our database, we have worked out a single representation that covers all MWLUs ranging from fixed expressions to these of highest morphosyntactic flexibility. 3 Representation of MWLUs in the lexical database In this section we explain how MWLUs are represented in EDBL (Aldezabal et al., 2001), a lexical database oriented to language processing that currently contains more than 80,000 entries, out of which 2,270 are MWLUs. Among these: • —69% are always unambiguous. The average number of Surface Realization Schemas (SRS, see section 3.2) is 1.02. • —23% are sometimes unambiguous and have 3.6 SRSs in average, half of them ambiguous. • —8% are always ambiguous and have 1.2 SRSs in average. We want to point out that almost all of the unambiguous MWLUs have only one SRS, their components appearing in contiguous positions and always in the same order.

Some approaches treat them at tokenization stage, identifying fixed phrases, such as prepositional phrases or compounds, included in a list (Carmona et al., 1998; Karlsson et al., 1995).

However, some groups of MWEs are not subject to be included in a database, because they comprise an open class of expressions. That is the case of collocations, compounds or named entities.

Section 3 describes the representation of MWLUs in the lexical database. Section 4 is devoted to the description and evaluation of the automatic treatment of MWEs by means of HABIL. Section 5 summarizes future work. And, finally, section 6 outlines some conclusions. 2 Multiword Expressions in the processing of real texts in Basque The definition of the term Multiword Expression and the types of such MWEs to be treated in NLP may vary considerably depending on the purposes or &amp;quot;the depth of processing being undertaken&amp;quot; (Copestake et al., 2002). Multiword itself is a vague term. At text level, a word could be defined as &amp;quot;any string of characters between two blanks&amp;quot; (Fontenelle et al., 1994). This is not applicable to languages as Japanese, which are typically written without spaces. Besides, a great number of MWEs that in uninflected languages would be multiword, constitute a single typographic unit in agglutinative languages such as Basque (ziurrenik &apos;most probably&apos;, aurrerantzean &apos;from now on&apos;, aurretiaz &apos;in advance&apos;). Therefore, we consider them single words and they are included in the lexical database as such (or recognized by </context>

It also allows us to lemmatize word combinations as a unit and yet to parse the components individually if necessary. Moreover, we describe HABIL, a tool for the automatic processing of these expressions, and we give some evaluation results. This work must be placed in a general framework of written Basque processing tools, which currently ranges from the tokenization and segmentation of single words up to the syntactic tagging of general texts. 1 Introduction Most texts are rich in multiword expressions, which must be necessarily processed if we want any NLP tool to perform accurately. Jackendoff (1997) estimates that their number in the speakers&apos; lexicon “is of the same order of magnitude as the number of single words”. There is no agreement among authors about the definition of the term Multiword Expression. However, in this article, Multiword Expressions (hereafter MWE) refer to any word combinations ranging from idioms, over proper names, compounds, lexical and grammatical collocations... to institutionalized phrases. MWEs comprise both semantically compositional and non-compositional combinations, and both syntactically regular and idiosyncratic phrases, including complex named entities</context>

The MWLU representation we have adopted allows us to lemmatize the word combination as a unit and yet to parse the components individually whenever necessary. In order to do so, when describing each MWLU, we specify whether the elements in the MWLU must be analyzed separately or not3. 4 Treatment of multiword expressions MWEs could be treated at different stages of the language process. Some approaches treat them at tokenization stage, identifying fixed phrases, such as prepositional phrases or compounds, included in a list (Carmona et al., 1998; Karlsson et al., 1995). Other approaches rely on morphological analysis to better identify the features of the MWE using finite state technology (Breidt et al., 1996). Finally, there is another approach that identifies them after the tagging process, allowing the correction of some tagging errors (Leech et al., 1994). All of these approaches are based on the use of a closed set of MWLUs that could be included in a list or a database. However, some groups of MWEs are not subject to be included in a database, because they comprise an open class of expressions. That is the case of collocations, compounds or named enti</context>
