ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999957555555556">
In this study we map out a way to build event
representations incrementally, using information
which may be widely distributed across a dis-
course. An enhanced Discourse Representation
(Kamp, 1981) provides the vehicle both for car-
rying open event roles through the discourse until
they can be instantiated by NPs, and for resolving
the reference of these otherwise problematic NPs
by binding them to the event roles.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999697380952381">
The computational linguistics literature includes
a wide variety of ideas about how to represent
events in as much detail as is required for reason-
ing about their implications. Less has been writ-
ten about how to use information in text to incre-
mentally build those event representations as dis-
course progresses, especially when the identifica-
tion of event participants and other details is dis-
persed across a number of structures. We will be
concerned here with providing a representational
framework for this incremental event-building, and
with using that representation to examine the ways
in which reference to the internal structure of
events contributes to discourse cohesion. That is,
we will be interested both in the process of gleaning
fully-specified event descriptions from continuous
text, and in showing how individual elements of an
event&apos;s internal structure can behave anaphorically.
Examples of the kinds of linkages that must be
dealt with in building representations of events
from text follow:

The examples in (1) are familiar cases of syntac-
tically obligatory control; we will consider their be-
havior to be straightforwardly and locally resolved.
The sentences of (2) show infinitival relatives, pur-
pose, and &apos;in-order-to&apos; clauses in which control of
the infinitive (and hence of its implicit subject) is
sometimes clear, sometimes ambiguous. In (3), a
subject infinitival phrase receives an unavoidably
generic reading in one case and a non-generic but
ambiguous reading in the other. Finally, the exam-
ples of (4) indicate that nominalizations of events
also have roles whose reference must be determined,
and whose existence and identity has consequences
for subsequent discourse.
Aside from the sentences in (1), in which control
is unambiguously sorted out within the sentence on
the basis of verb type, all the examples above can

be paraphrased with equivalent multi-sentence con-
structions in which the facts of referent-assignment
are identical. Even more extended discourses, in-
cluding dialogues such as that in (5), show the in-
fluence of an instantiated situation or event over
the assignment of referents to entities introduced
later in the discourse.

a modification of Chao&apos;s 28)
The distribution of event participants across
multi-sentence discourses is sufficient to lay to rest
any idea that the linkage is syntactically governed,
even though the entities which provide cohesion in
these examples are arguments which are typically
bound syntactically. That is, it seems that initially
unfilled thematic roles play a part in tying one sen-
tence to the next. Event roles left unfilled after
the operation of local syntactic processing are ap-
parently still &apos;active&apos;, in some sense, and they ap-
pear to be able to attract participants from exter-
nal structures to fill them. Carlson and Tanenhaus
(1988) provide psycholinguistic evidence that this
is indeed the case; open thematic roles do appear
to be effective as cohesion devices.&apos;
Previous theories about how open roles become
filled (mostly intra-sententially) have been based
on notions ranging from strictly syntactic to more
pragmatic, knowledge-based approaches. Obvi-
ously wherever we do have what appears to be
invariant and obligatory control, we want to ex-
ploit a syntactic explanation. However, these cases
&apos;Whether it is just thematic roles, or those plus certain
types of highly predictable adjuncts, or a wide variety of
other types of slots which can provide the type of linking we
are talking about is still an open question. We do assume
that for each event we will encode not only THAT it expects
certain arguments to be filled, but HOW it expects them to
be filled; for instance it should be perceived that the noun
&apos;salesman&apos; is a highly suitable Agent for a sale event. We
may need to know about more than that. In particular, we
may require metonymical devices that make discourses like
the following possible.
I had a hard time shopping.
First, the parking lot was all full....
Coherence in this example clearly depends on being able
to associate &apos;the parking lot&apos; with &apos;store&apos; and &apos;store&apos; with
the Location of the &apos;shopping&apos; event. This extension is no
different in kind, however, from the core of what we are
proposing here.
do not account for much of the ground that we
need to cover. As the examples above show, even
the syntactic position PRO often defies straightfor-
ward control assignment, and in the case of nominal
references to events, Williams&apos; (1985) arguments
against a strictly syntactic account of referent-
assignment are convincing. Of course, there are no
syntactic means for linking arguments with event
descriptions intersententially. Appeals to underly-
ing thematic role notions and/or more pragmati-
cally governed operators then seem to hold more
promise for the kinds of situations we are describ-
ing.
Given their currency above and below the sen-
tence level, and the fact that they seem to be sen-
sitive to both syntactic and pragmatic constraints,
the behavior of unfilled event roles will best be ex-
plained at the discourse level. Like other discourse
anaphoric elements, open roles can not only receive
their reference from distant structures, but they
also seem to be used productively to create links
between linguistic structures and to extend focus
in both forward and backward directions.
To machine-build representations of events
whose essential components are dispersed across
multiple structures, two key ingredients are neces-
sary. First, the system must have knowledge about
events and their expected participants and other
characteristics. Given this, one can make predic-
tions about the expectancy of arguments and the
underlying properties they should hold. The sec-
ond ingredient required is a means for assessing
the mutual accessibility of discourse entities. As
has been pointed out by various researchers, sen-
tential structure, thematic relationships, and dis-
course configurations all may play a part in deter-
mining which entities must, might, and cannot be
associated with others, and a discourse framework
must make it possible to take all these factors into
account in assigning reference and building repre-
sentations of events.
Our intent in this paper is to provide a prototype
model of event building which is effective across
clauses, both intra- and inter-sententially. We will
incorporate into this representation of events a
means for assessing accessibility of events and event
participants for anaphoric reference, and we will
use the representation to examine the anaphoric
behavior of open roles.
Event-Building Representation: We have
chosen DRT as an overall representation scheme,
though we will be modifying it to some extent.
DRT has been designed to perform a variety of

<bodyText confidence="0.9999375">
tasks, including proper placement of individual
events in an overall discourse representation and
making it possible to indicate which event entities
are available for future anaphoric referencing and
what constraints hold over those entities. A typi-
cal DR for a simple sentence is given in (6). The
sentence, &apos;John gave Bill a dollar&apos; is designated by
the variable El and has associated with it a pred-
icate calculus statement that contains the predi-
cate, give, and argument variables VI, V2, and V3.
The give event specification and other constraints,
again in predicate calculus form, are contained in
the lower portion of the DR. In the top half of the
DR, any entities, including events, which are avail-
able for subsequent anaphoric referencing are listed
by their variable names.

Our representation departs in some ways from
the way in which the binding of anaphors is usu-
ally shown in DRT. In versions of DRT with re-
altime processing, whenever an NP is being pro-
cessed, two things can happen: i) either the NP
can be linked with a previously occurring NP and
become anaphorically bound to it, or ii) a new ref-
erent can be generated for the NP and posted when
no antecedent can be found. For our purposes, it
is convenient to include in the DR an extra tier
which contains items which have not yet found a
referent.2 To designate the three parts of our DRs,
we will use the following tier labels:
Available Referents - AR
Unbound Referents - UR, and
Constraints on Referents - CR.
For processing purposes, we will not attempt to
immediately bind anaphors as they are encountered
in sentences, beyond what we can get for free from
syntactic analysis. Rather, we will initiate a two-
stage process, with the first DR having unbound
anaphors and the second attempting representa-
tion of binding. In the first representation, we will
2 A buffer of this sort may be implicit in other treatments
of anaphora resolution; our extension is just to add it ex-
plicitly to the DR representation. Without some such buffer
it is not clear how one would handle sentences like &apos;When
he was a kid, John was pretty goofy.&apos;
post unbound anaphors in UR. We will also post
constraints for unbound items within CR to reflect
their type, e.g. (PRO XI), (DEFINITE X2), and
(HE X3). When items in UR become bound (or
when their referents are found), their bindings will
be represented in AR, they will be crossed off from
within UR, and a new DR will be created to reflect
the change in status.
We will also revise the representation of event
descriptions in CR, by including in them implicit
arguments for each event as well as ones which are
explicitly realized in the sentence. Every event will
have its underlying thematic and highly expected
adjunctive roles posted in CR, whether the roles
have been filled or not. These unfilled or implicit
roles are posted as entities requiring binding, in
UR. The constraint (IMPLICIT X) will be included
for any open role, and for each event variable we
will note in CR whether it was a verbal or other-
than-verbal description.
Example (7) contains an instance of what we
intend. The nominalized form of an investigate
event, marked with El, has two open slots: Agent
and Theme, VI and V2, respectively. El is posted
as a possible referent in AR; its two implicit argu-
ments VI and V2 are posted in UR. Similarly, E2,
the launch event is posted in AR, while its open
agent role, designated by V3, is shown in UR; its
explicit Theme is already posted in AR as El.
AR: El, E2
UR: V1, V2, V3
CR: El:(investigate (Agent V1)(Theme V2))
E2:(launch (Agent V3) (Theme El))

We will show that because of the inclusion of
open roles in the representation of events and on
the UR tier, this framework for discourse repre-
sentation makes it possible to link arguments that
appear in a variety of structures to their respective
events, and thus provides more predictive power for
anaphoric resolution processes.

clausal events by providing various examples. We
will move from the easiest examples, those that
have much syntactic support, to the hardest, those
whose resolution is mostly based on pragmatic
grounds.

We treat the binding of the PRO subject of em-
bedded infinitive as a case of open role filling, and
for our purposes, such binding is fundamentally
the same in both obligatory and non-obligatory en-
vironments, since in every case the result is that
open event roles are filled by arguments from ex-
ternal sources. That is, even where control is gen-
erated entirely within syntax, the links are con-
strued as being the result of a cross-clause event-
building process. The operational difference is just
that wherever control CAN be reliably determined
syntactically, as in the case of obligatory control
verbs, indices between controllers and PROs will be
in place when initial DRs are generated.3 A typical
DR with a controller-controllee relationship would
appear as in (8).

<bodyText confidence="0.983654625">
In the event-building examples that we show in
the remainder of the paper, the aim is the con-
struction of DRs that ultimately link events and
arguments in this same way. What is different
about the more complicated cases is just the means
of accomplishing the linking. In the case of non-
obligatory control of PRO, such results may often
require information from several levels of process-
ing, and an adequate event-building representation
must be able to accommodate the representation of
all factors which are shown to be effective in pre-
dicting that control.
Nishigauchi (1984), for example, demonstrates
that choice of controller can often be determined
through knowledge of thematic roles (see also Bach,
1982, and Dowty and Ladusaw, 1988, for their ac-
counts). In Nishigauchi&apos;s account, control of infini-
tival purpose clauses and infinitival relative clauses
is primarily dependent on the presence of one of
three thematic roles from his so-called Primary Lo-
cation hierarchy; the idea is that a controller can
be assigned if a Goal, Location, or Source is present
in the sentence. Where a Goal is present, its refer-
3 Dowty and Ladusaw (1988) believe that control is gen-
erally established via pragmatic means. They claim that it
is pragmatic knowledge of events that enables one to gen-
erate links between participants and events. They also be-
lieve, however, that there are a large number of situations
for which control has become grammaticized, and that there
does not need to be any internal analysis in these situations
to comprehend argument-to-event links.
ent has precedence as controller; where Goal is not
present, Location or Source can take control.
The examples in (9) are indicative of the kinds
of links that can be made via this hierarchy. In ex-
ample (9a), the Goal &apos;Mary&apos; controls the infinitival
relative.4 In (9b), John ends up with the book, so
&apos;John&apos; is Goal, while in (9c), John as the possessor
of the book is its Location; in both cases &apos;John&apos;
controls the infinitive.

b) John bought a book PRO to read.
c) John has a book PRO to read.

<bodyText confidence="0.989032666666667">
To handle examples like (9a-c), we begin with ini-
tial DRs that include the kind of information that
can be expected from a syntactic/semantic parser
that produces initial logical forms. For instance, we
know that &apos;John&apos; is the Agent and &apos;Mary&apos; the Goal
of a buy event, and that the PRO subject of &apos;read&apos;
(the Agent of the read event) has no binding. The
object of &apos;read&apos; is identified in syntax as `book&apos;.5
An initial DR for (9a) is illustrated in (10).

(10). The initial DR for John bought Mary a book

At this stage, a positive check for Goal in El re-
sults in the binding of the unbound variable X4 to
X3 in AR; X4 is then canceled out of UR. Were
there no Goal in El, a Location or Source would
have the same effect. In a case where none of these
roles is specified explicitly, as in example (11) (from
Bach), it must be filled by default and/or from

4 &apos;Mary&apos; is more typically interpreted as Beneficiary in
this sentence, but Nishigauchi claims that since Mary ends
up with the book, she is the Goal. Bach&apos;s (1982) explanation
is similar; it is that entity which the matrix verb puts in a
position to do the VERBing which controls the infinitive.
5This analysis assumes that the infinitive is recognized
as an infinitival relative on &apos;book&apos;, so that it does have an
Object gap. The infinitive could also of course be an &apos;in-
order-to&apos; clause with intransitive &apos;read&apos;, in which case the

Nominal Descriptions of Events: Much discus-

<bodyText confidence="0.979388285714286">
sion has focused on the extent to which the internal
structure of NPs that have nominalized events as
heads, e.g. &apos;the destruction of the city by the Ro-
mans,&apos; carries over the internal structure of the as-
sociated verb-headed structure, as in &apos;the Romans
destroyed the city&apos;. The consensus is that such de-
verbal noun phrases, while obviously semantically
parallel in some ways, are not equivalent to ver-
bal descriptions. In particular, semantic arguments
associated with the nominalized form are held to
be syntactically adjunctive in nature and entirely
optional, even where they would be expressed as
obligatory complements to the associated verb.
We are interested here in cases in which nomi-
nals representing events are linked with arguments
that are not part of the same immediate syntac-
tic environment. Several examples are provided in
(12) and (13). As Higgins (1973, cf. Dowty, 1986)
has discussed, in sentences like (12a) the subject
of the matrix verb &apos;make&apos; can be associated with
the Agent position of an embedded nominal; there-
fore we understand &apos;Romans&apos; to be the Agent of
&apos;attack&apos;. It is apparently the nature of the verb
&apos;make&apos; that permits this association; &apos;perform&apos; be-
haves similarly. The verbs &apos;suffer&apos; and &apos;undergo&apos;,
on the other hand, link their subjects to the Theme
or Experiencer of a nominalized event (that is, to
what would be the expected object of the associ-
ated verb), as shown in (12b).
12a) The Romans made an attack on the
Sabines.
b) The Romans suffered a
crippling defeat.
Williams (1985) makes use of the notion that a
matrix verb can impose an association between its
own arguments and any implicit arguments of a
controlled event noun. However as the following
examples show, not all verbs impose association of
arguments to the degree that &apos;perform&apos; and &apos;un-
dergo&apos; do. A verb may show some tendency toward
association between Agents, as &apos;schedule&apos; does in
(13a), but be open to a realignment of matrix sub-
ject with some other more focused role in other
environments, as in (13b). Some may have such
a slight tendency to associate arguments in a par-
ticular way that it can be disrupted by syntactic
structure, as in (13c) and (13d). In (13c) Sam may
or may not be a party himself to the agreement,
but in (13d) he is probably not involved.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983013">
(13a) John scheduled a takeover/meeting.
b) John scheduled a haircut/a checkup.
c) Sam negotiated an agreement.
d) An agreement was negotiated
by Sam.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985022405405406">
What is necessary in order to sort this out is
a working framework within which these tenden-
cies can be represented and their interactions with
other factors tracked. Where the tendency towards
association is as strong as it is for &apos;make&apos;, which is
considered to be semantically &amp;quot;bleached&amp;quot; in such
constructions as make an attempt, make an ar-
rangement, make a promise, make an attack (that
is, it could be said to have become just a mech-
anism for linking matrix subject to object event),
our representation will allow for an early linking at
the level of syntax. For the general run of cases
where an event noun is the object of a matrix verb,
as in (13a-d), we must rely on our knowledge of typ-
ical interactions between events in order to decide
what the linking between matrix subject and em-
bedded event might be. The interaction between
the AR and the UR tiers of the DR, along with
constraints on variables of both types, allows us to
manipulate the association as may seem appropri-
ate, with as much knowledge as we have at the time
of linking.
Cross-Sentence Event-building: As we men-
tioned earlier, the linking phenomena we are ex-
amining hold across, as well as within sentences.
Discourse (14) is provided as an example of a dis-
course in which an open role is filled in a subsequent
sentence. In the first sentence, there are actually
several open roles. Left unfilled are (at least) the
roles Source and Exchange. With the DR struc-
turing we have chosen, an initial DR for the first
sentence of (14) would be built as in (15). The main
thing to note in (15) is that the open role variables,
are Z1 and Qi, the Source and the Exchange, have
been posted in UR.
(14a) Pete bought a car.
b) The salesman was a real jerk.

The initial DR for the second sentence of (14) is
in (16a). The variable X2, representing &apos;the sales-
man&apos;, has been posted in the unresolved NP buffer,
and X2 will be the first thing to be resolved by way
of anaphora operators.
The anaphoric processes invoked at this point
would be much like what has been promoted else-
where. A variety of factors would come into play,
including looking at basic semantic characteristics,
centering, etc. We would also want to provide a
means for ordering available referents as they are
placed in AR in terms of their forward focusing
character (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1983).
For &apos;the salesman&apos;, the previously occurring dis-
course entities that are available as referents are El,
Xl, and Y1 in the previous AR, and Z1 and Q1 in
the previous UR. The possible referent Xl, &apos;Pete&apos;,
ranks as a possible candidate but not a very likely
one, since if Pete were to be referred to in a subse-
quent sentence it would more likely be done via a
personal pronoun. The other available referent, Yl,
the &apos;car&apos;, is semantically unlikely and is not con-
sidered a good choice. A search is then made into
the previous UR. The Source Z1, in this instance,
would be a highly likely choice, since any seman-
tic qualities that would accompany &apos;the salesman&apos;
would fit those of the Source of a buy event.
It has been reported in previous studies that def-
inite NPs often have no clear antecedent. For in-
stance, 363 out of 649 definite NPs found in a study
of corpus of dialogues (Brunner, Ferrara, and Whit-
temore, 1990) had no direct linguistic antecedents.
53% of the 363 definite NPs had semantically in-
ferrable antecedents, where definite NPs were used
to refer to attributes of antecedents and the like,
but not to antecedents themselves. Apparently,
definite NPs function to focus on some partial as-
pect of an antecedent or topic and not necessarily
to refer directly to it as a whole.6 Following the

tecedents, and were only &apos;topically&apos; tied to the context. It
might prove beneficial to re-examine these true orphans and
see if any of these refer back to open roles.
line of reasoning that one could take from these
findings, it could be the case that there is actually
a preference for definite NPs to refer back to open
roles, since they represent particular points of focus
or sub-components of events.
&apos;Salesman&apos;, via the variable X2, would then get
bound to the buy event and a second DR with no
unresolved anaphora would be returned, as shown
in (16b).

Similarly, the DR for the first sentence would
need modification since now the open Source role,
represented as Z1, would need to be bound to X2,
&apos;the salesman&apos; (this updated binding is not shown).
Limits on Linking: There are limits on the
kinds of linking that can be effected between event
descriptions and fillers for open roles. For instance,
note that the open slot in the example above does
not seem to be available for pronominal reference.
If (14b) is replaced with &apos;He was a real jerk,&apos; the
sequence of sentences makes no sense (or at least
we would have to say that the same role is not
accessed). This restriction appears to be true in
general for pronominal reference into event descrip-
tions, as the following examples show:

<listItem confidence="0.9788348">
• I was attacked. *He was enormous.
• We unloaded the car. *They [the suitcases]
were very heavy.
• This borrowing has got to stop. *They [the
borrowed things] get left all over the place.

nal or verbal, may function as an antecedent for

subsequent anaphoric reference, including pronom-
inal reference CI went swimming. It was horrible.&apos;).
It is just pronominal reference INTO an event de-
scription, especially a verbal one, which seems to be
blocked. The event described in (17a) below cannot
typically be elaborated upon by (17ai). However,
(17ai) is fine as a continuation if (17aii), in which
the event is nominalized, comes between. (17b), in
which the agree event is referred to nominally, can
be followed by (17bi), (17bii) or both.

In our representation the posting of event de-
scriptions, verbal and nominal, in AR, accounts
for the fact that each can be linked to by a sub-
sequent pronominal element. Our intuition is that
in order to be completely accessible as a referent,
however, an entity must have not only a semantic
but also a phonological realization; since open roles
are merely implicit until they are bound, it is pre-
dictable that there would be a difference in their
accessibility. For this reason we post open roles
only in UR, not in AR, and in our framework this
blocks pronominal access to them.
As for the fact that nominalizing an event seems
to ease the restrictions on referring into it by means
of a pronoun (as in the (17ai-ii) examples), our
guess is that in these cases the pronominal refer-
ence is actually to the event as a thing, and that the
apparent elaboration of roles is allowed by the same
mechanisms that allow addition of other adjuncts
to nominals, as in &apos;I really enjoyed my vacation. It
was in Texas in July.&apos; In any case our tagging of
event variables in CR as nominal or verbal allows
this distinction to be taken into account.
The idea of role slots which are canceled from UR
as they are bound explains another restriction on
the ways in which events can be elaborated. (17c)
above cannot appropriately follow either (17a) or
(17b), because we already know from either that
the agreement was between Bob and Joe. Further,
if (17bii) follows (17b), then we know that Sam
is not himself a participant in the agreement he
negotiated, because we already know from (17b)
that the agreement was between Bob and Joe. In
each of these cases, the open role in question will
have been canceled out of UR by binding to other
entities before the new anaphoric elements come
along, and so there is no possibility of filling a role
twice.
Hard Cases: Finally, we offer a few comments
on a &amp;quot;pretty hard&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;really hard&amp;quot; example,
given in (18) and (19). These are revised versions
of the discourse given in (5). The task in both cases
is to bind the referent &apos;John&apos;, which appears in the
first sentence, to the Agent slot of &apos;run&apos;, which is
in the second sentence.
John has been hobbling around
on a sprained ankle.
Today, the nurse said it would be best
not to run for two weeks.
John has been hobbling around
on a sprained ankle.
Today, the nurse told his mother it would
be best not to run for two weeks.
To resolve these examples, we can employ two
tactics. First, we will impose a thematic role asso-
ciation between the Addressee of a say event and
the Agent of embedded agentless verbs that denote
advice. Secondly, we will use the notion of open
implicit roles in DRs to obtain a filler for the open
Addressee role in the say/tell event.7
With these two notions in place, we can easily
resolve (18). (18)&apos;s context provides only one pos-
sible candidate for the open Addressee role, namely
&apos;John&apos; (that is, if we disregard the speaker of the
utterance). Once &apos;John&apos; is used to fill that role, we
can link &apos;John also, through the default thematic
role association, to the Agent slot for &apos;run&apos;.
(19), however shows that the situation can be
more complicated. There is no open Addressee
role in (19); the explicit Addressee is &apos;his mother&apos;.
By the process above, then, &apos;his mother&apos; would be
linked to the Agent slot of &apos;run&apos;, which of course
is incorrect. We do not have a perfect explanation
for why (19) is different from (18), other than that
John&apos;s mother is not the ultimate Addressee. That
is, a mechanism is needed that can determine that
John&apos;s mother transfers the advice on to the per-
son who needs it, namely the ailing person, namely
John. Even if such a complicated scenario is the
7A more general form of the first step would be a the-
matic role reasoning device that permits PROs to be linked
with those entities which are most eligible to carry out the
action of the subjectless infinitive. This formulation would
be in the spirit of Bach, 1982.

correct one, we believe that our combined thematic
role/discourse representation would provide a plat-
form upon which one could make use of such prag-
matic information.
Conclusion: Our stated task was to provide
a vehicle for constructing event representations
which have roles that are not filled by local syntac-
tic means. DRT is a natural vehicle for this kind of
exercise, given certain extensions. The major ex-
tension is the posting of open event (thematic) roles
as potential anchors for subsequent reference. In
other words we are treating open roles as a type of
anaphor. Where roles integral to an understanding
of an event are not immediately filled on the basis
of local syntax, we hypothesize that they should
be posted nonetheless as not-yet-instantiated slots.
We have added a tier to the conventional notion of
a DR to accommodate this posting.
Our experiments with this representation have
shown how information from various levels of pro-
cessing can be brought together in event building.
This framework also allows us to discover limits on
linking phenomena; in particular, it naturally illus-
trates the inaccessibility of open roles to pronomi-
nal reference, and the tendency for definite NPs to
link to substructures within an event.

We would like to note that the idea of using DRs
as a means for building events across clauses came
from a comment by Rich Thomason, cited in Dowty
(1986:32): &amp;quot;Rich Thomason (p.c.) has suggested to
me that a very natural way to construct a theory
of event anaphora would be via Discourse Repre-
sentation Theory.&amp;quot; Thomason was addressing (we
think) the notion of referring to events via nominal-
izations. We just extended the idea of using DRT
to construct events across clauses to also include
those denoted by verbs.
