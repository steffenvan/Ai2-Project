This paper reports prototype multilin-
gual query expansion system relying on
LMF compliant lexical resources. The
system is one of the deliverables of a
three-year project aiming at establish-
ing an international standard for language
resources which is applicable to Asian
languages. Our important contributions
to ISO 24613, standard Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF) include its robustness
to deal with Asian languages, and its ap-
plicability to cross-lingual query tasks, as
illustrated by the prototype introduced in
this paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.994859428571429">
During the last two decades corpus-based ap-
proaches have come to the forefront of NLP re-
search. Since without corpora there can be no
corpus-based research, the creation of such lan-
guage resources has also necessarily advanced
as well, in a mutually beneficial synergetic re-
lationship. One of the advantages of corpus-
based approaches is that the techniques used
are less language specific than classical rule-
based approaches where a human analyses the
behaviour of target languages and constructs
rules manually. This naturally led the way
for international resource standardisation, and in-
deed there is a long standing precedent in the
West for it. The Human Language Technol-
ogy (HLT) society in Europe has been particu-
larly zealous in this regard, propelling the cre-
ation of resource interoperability through a se-
ries of initiatives, namely EAGLES (Sanfilippo et
al., 1999), PAROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000),
ISLE/MILE (Ide et al., 2003), and LIRICS1. These

continuous efforts have matured into activities in
ISO-TC37/SC42, which aims at making an inter-
national standard for language resources.
However, due to the great diversity of languages
themselves and the differing degree of technolog-
ical development for each, Asian languages, have
received less attention for creating resources than
their Western counterparts. Thus, it has yet to be
determined if corpus-based techniques developed
for well-computerised languages are applicable on
a broader scale to all languages. In order to effi-
ciently develop Asian language resources, utilis-
ing an international standard in this creation has
substantial merits.
We launched a three-year project to create an
international standard for language resources that
includes Asian languages. We took the following
approach in seeking this goal.
• Based on existing description frameworks,
each research member tries to describe sev-
eral lexical entries and find problems with
them.
• Through periodical meetings, we exchange
information about problems found and gen-
eralise them to propose solutions.
• Through an implementation of an application
system, we verify the effectiveness of the pro-
posed framework.
Below we summarise our significant contribution
to an International Standard (ISO24613; Lexical
Markup Framework: LMF).
1st year After considering many characteristics
of Asian languages, we elucidated the shortcom-
ings of the LMF draft (ISO24613 Rev.9). The
draft lacks the following devices for Asian lan-
guages.

We evaluated the effectiveness of LMF on a mul-
tilingual information retrieval system, particularly
the effectiveness for linguistically motivated query
expansion.
The linguistically motivated query expansion
system aims to refine a user’s query by exploiting
the richer information contained within a lexicon
described using the adapted LMF framework. Our
lexicons are completely complaint with this inter-
national standard. For example, a user inputs a
keyword “ticket” as a query. Conventional query
expansion techniques expand this keyword to a
set of related words by using thesauri or ontolo-
gies (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). Using
the framework proposed by this project, expand-
ing the user’s query becomes a matter of following
links within the lexicon, from the source lexical
entry or entries through predicate-argument struc-
tures to all relevant entries (Figure 1). We focus
on expanding the user inputted list of nouns to rel-
evant verbs, but the reverse would also be possible
using the same technique and the same lexicon.
This link between entries is established through
the semantic type of a given sense within a lexical
entry. These semantic types are defined by higher-
level ontologies, such as MILO or SIMPLE (Lenci
et al., 2000) and are used in semantic predicates
that take such semantic types as a restriction ar-
gument. Since senses for verbs contain a link to
a semantic predicate, using this semantic type, the
system can then find any/all entries within the lexi-
con that have this semantic type as the value of the
restriction feature of a semantic predicate for any
of their senses. As a concrete example, let us con-
tinue using the “ticket” scenario from above. The
lexical entry for “ticket” might contain a semantic
type definition something like in Figure 2.

By referring to the lexicon, we can then derive
any actions and events that take the semantic type
“ARTIFACT” as an argument.
First all semantic predicates are searched for ar-
guments that have an appropriate restriction, in
this case “ARTIFACT” as shown in Figure 3, and
then any lexical entries that refer to these predi-
cates are returned. An equally similar definition
would exist for “buy”, “find” and so on. Thus,

related verbs, we know that these verbs can take

3.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856533333333">
To test the efficacy of the LMF-compliant lexi-
cal resources, we created a system implementing
the query expansion mechanism explained above.
The system was developed in Java for its “com-
pile once, run anywhere” portability and its high-
availability of reusable off-the-shelf components.
On top of Java 5, the system was developed us-
ing JBoss Application Server 4.2.3, the latest stan-
dard, stable version of the product at the time of
development. To provide fast access times, and
easy traversal of relational data, a RDB was used.
The most popular free open-source database was
selected, MySQL, to store all lexicons imported
into the system, and the system was accessed, as a
web-application, via any web browser.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989978">
3.2 Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917347826087">
The finalised database schema is shown in Fig-
ure 4. It describes the relationships between en-
tities, and more or less mirrors the classes found
within the adapted LMF framework, with mostly
only minor exceptions where it was efficacious for
querying the data. Due to space constraints, meta-
data fields, such as creation time-stamps have been
left out of this diagram. Since the system also al-
lows for multiple lexicons to co-exist, a lexicon id
resides in every table. This foreign key has been
highlighted in a different color, but not connected
via arrows to make the diagram easier to read. In
addition, though in actuality this foreign key is not
required for all tables, it has been inserted as a con-
venience for querying data more efficiently, even
within join tables (indicated in blue). Having mul-
tiple lexical resources co-existing within the same
database allows for several advantageous features,
and will be described later. Some tables also con-
tain a text id, which stores the original id attribute
for that element found within the XML. This is
not used in the system itself, and is stored only for
reference.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997136">
3.3 System design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990935483871">
As mentioned above, the application is deployed
to JBoss AS as an ear-file. The system it-
self is composed of java classes encapsulating
the data contained within the database, a Pars-
ing/Importing class for handling the LMF XML
files after they have been validated, and JSPs,
which contain HTML, for displaying the inter-
face to the user. There are three main sections
to the application: Search, Browse, and Config-
ure. Explaining last to first, the Configure section,
shown in Figure 5, allows users to create a new
lexicon within the system or append to an exist-
ing lexicon by uploading a LMF XML file from
their web browser, or delete existing lexicons that
are no longer needed/used. After import, the data
may be immediately queried upon with no other
changes to system configuration, from within both
the Browse and Search sections. Regardless of
language, the rich syntactic/semantic information
contained within the lexicon is sufficient for car-
rying out query expansion on its own.
The Browse section (Figure 6) allows the user to
select any available lexicon to see the relationships
contained within it, which contains tabs for view-
ing all noun to verb connections, a list of nouns, a
list of verbs, and a list of semantic types. Each has
appropriate links allowing the user to easily jump
to a different tab of the system. Clicking on a noun
takes them to the Search section (Figure 7). In this
section, the user may select many lexicons to per-
form query extraction on, as is visible in Figure 7.

3.4 Semantic information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998266666667">
This new type of query expansion requires rich
lexical information. We augmented our data using
the SIMPLE ontology for semantic types, using
the same data for different languages. This had
the added benefit of allowing cross-language ex-
pansion as a result. In steps two and three of Fig-
ure 1 when senses are retrieved that take specific
semantic types as arguments, this process can be
done across all (or as many as are selected) lex-
icons in the database. Thus, results such as are
shown in Figure 7 are possible. In this figure the
Japanese word for “nail” is entered, and results for
both selected languages, Japanese and Italian, are
returned. This feature requires the unification of
the semantic type ontology strata.

<bodyText confidence="0.999880428571429">
Next steps for the QE platform are to explore the
use of other information already defined within the
adapted framework, specifically sense relations.
Given to the small size of our sample lexicon, data
sparsity is naturally an issue, but hopefully by ex-
ploring and exploiting these sense relations prop-
erly, the system may be able to further expand a
user’s query to include a broader range of selec-
tions using any additional semantic types belong-
ing to these related senses. The framework also
contains information about the order in which syn-
tactic arguments should be placed. This informa-
tion should be used to format the results from the
user’s query appropriately.

4 An Additional Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992975">
We conducted some additional query expansion
experiments using a corpus that was acquired from
Chinese LDC (No. “2004-863-009”) as abase (see
below). This corpus marked an initial achievement
in building a multi-lingual parallel corpus for sup-
porting development of cross-lingual NLP appli-
cations catering to the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
The corpus contains parallel texts in Chinese,
English and Japanese and covers 5 domains that
are closely related to the Olympics: traveling, din-
ing, sports, traffic and business. The corpus con-
sists of example sentences, typical dialogues and
articles from the Internet, as well as other language
teaching materials. To deal with the different lan-
guages in a uniform manner, we converted the cor-
pus into our proposed LMF-compliant lexical re-
sources framework, which allowed the system to
expand the query between all the languages within
the converted resources without additional modifi-
cations.
As an example of how this IR system func-
tioned, suppose that Mr. Smith will be visiting
Beijing to see the Olympic games and wants to
know how to buy a newspaper. Using this system,
he would first enter the query “newspaper”. For
this query, with the given corpus, the system re-
turns 31 documents, fragments of the first 5 shown
below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.909073833333333">
(1) I’ll bring an English newspaper immediately.
(2) Would you please hand me the newspaper.
(3) There’s no use to go over the newspaper ads.
(4) Let’s consult the newspaper for such a film.
(5) I have little confidence in what the newspa-
pers say.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999588636363636">
Yet it can be seen that the displayed results are not
yet useful enough to know how to buy a newspa-
per, though useful information may in fact be in-
cluded within some of the 31 documents. Using
the lexical resources, the query expansion module
suggests “buy”, “send”, “get”, “read”, and “sell”
as candidates to add for a revised query.
Mr. Smith wants to buy a newspaper, so he se-
lects “buy” as the expansion term. With this query
the system returns 11 documents, fragments of the
first 5 listed below.
</bodyText>

Table Tennis in today’s newspaper, Miss?
(10) newspaper says we must be cautious about
tidal waves.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981362904761905">
This list shows improvement, as information about
newspapers and shopping is present, but still ap-
pears to lack any documents directly related to
how to buy a newspaper.
Using co-occurrence indexes, the IR system
returns document (11) below, because the noun
“newspaper” and the verb “buy” appear in the
same sentence.
(11) You can make change at some stores, just buy
a newspaper or something.
From this example it is apparent that this sort
of query expansion is still too naive to apply to
real IR systems. It should be noted, however, that
our current aim of evaluation was in confirming
the advantage of LMF in dealing with multiple
languages, for which we conducted a similar run
with Chinese and Japanese. Results of these tests
showed that in following the LMF framework in
describing lexical resources, it was possibile to
deal with all three languages without changing the
mechanics of the system at all.

LMF is, admittedly, a “high-level” specification,
that is, an abstract model that needs to be fur-
ther developed, adapted and specified by the lex-
icon encoder. LMF does not provide any off-the-
shelf representation for a lexical resource; instead,
it gives the basic structural components of a lexi-
con, leaving full freedom for modeling the partic-
ular features of a lexical resource. One drawback
is that LMF provides only a specification manual
with a few examples. Specifications are by no
means instructions, exactly as XML specifications
are by no means instructions on how to represent
a particular type of data.
Going from LMF specifications to a true instan-
tiation of an LMF-compliant lexicon is a long way,
and comprehensive, illustrative and detailed ex-
amples for doing this are needed. Our prototype
system provides a good starting example for this
direction. LMF is often taken as a prescriptive
description, and its examples taken as pre-defined
normative examples to be used as coding guide-
lines. Controlled and careful examples of conver-
sion to LMF-compliant formats are also needed to
avoid too subjective an interpretation of the stan-
dard.
We believe that LMF will be a major base
for various SemanticWeb applications because it
provides interoperability across languages and di-
rectly contributes to the applications themselves,
such as multilingual translation, machine aided
translation and terminology access in different lan-
guages.
From the viewpoint of LMF, our prototype
demonstrates the adaptability of LMF to a rep-
resentation of real-scale lexicons, thus promoting
its adoption to a wider community. This project
is one of the first test-beds for LMF (as one of
its drawbacks being that it has not been tested on
a wide variety of lexicons), particularly relevant
since it is related to both Western and Asian lan-
guage lexicons. This project is a concrete attempt
to specify an LMF-compliant XML format, tested
for representative and parsing efficiency, and to
provide guidelines for the implementation of an
LMF-compliant format, thus contributing to the
reduction of subjectivity in interpretation of stan-
dards.
From our viewpoint, LMF has provided a for-
mat for exchange of information across differently
conceived lexicons. Thus LMF provides a stan-
dardised format for relating them to other lexical
models, in a linguistically controlled way. This
seems an important and promising achievement in
order to move the sector forward.

This paper described the results of a three-year
project for creating an international standard for
language resources in cooperation with other ini-
tiatives. In particular, we focused on query expan-
sion using the standard.
Our main contribution can be summarised as
follows.
• We have contributed to ISO TC37/SC4 ac-
tivities, by testing and ensuring the portabil-
ity and applicability of LMF to the devel-
opment of a description framework for NLP
lexicons for Asian languages. Our contribu-
tion includes (1) a package for derivational

morphology, (2) the syntax-semantic inter-
face with the problem of classifiers, and (3)
representational issues with the richness of
writing systems in Asian languages. As of
October 2008, LMF including our contribu-
tions has been approved as the international
standard ISO 26413.
• We discussed Data Categories necessary
for Asian languages, and exemplified sev-
eral Data Categories including reduplication,
classifier, honorifics and orthography. We
will continue to harmonise our activity with
that of ISO TC37/SC4 TDG2 with respect to
Data Categories.
• We designed and implemented an evaluation
platform of our description framework. We
focused on linguistically motivated query ex-
pansion module. The system works with lexi-
cons compliant with LMF and ontologies. Its
most significant feature is that the system can
deal with any language as far as the those lex-
icons are described according to LMF. To our
knowledge, this is the first working system
adopting LMF.
In this project, we mainly worked on three
Asian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Thai, on
top of the existing framework which was designed
mainly for European languages. We plan to dis-
tribute our results to HLT societies of other Asian
languages, requesting for their feedback through
various networks, such as the Asian language re-
source committee network under Asian Federation
of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP)3, and
the Asian Language Resource Network project4.
We believe our efforts contribute to international
activities like ISO-TC37/SC45 (Francopoulo et al.,
2006).

The linguistically motivated query expansion system aims to refine a user’s query by exploiting the richer information contained within a lexicon described using the adapted LMF framework. Our lexicons are completely complaint with this international standard. For example, a user inputs a keyword “ticket” as a query. Conventional query expansion techniques expand this keyword to a set of related words by using thesauri or ontologies (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). Using the framework proposed by this project, expanding the user’s query becomes a matter of following links within the lexicon, from the source lexical entry or entries through predicate-argument structures to all relevant entries (Figure 1). We focus on expanding the user inputted list of nouns to relevant verbs, but the reverse would also be possible using the same technique and the same lexicon. This link between entries is established through the semantic type of a given sense within a lexical entry. These semantic types are defined by higherlevel ontologies, such as MILO or SIMPLE (Len</context>

This link between entries is established through the semantic type of a given sense within a lexical entry. These semantic types are defined by higherlevel ontologies, such as MILO or SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000) and are used in semantic predicates that take such semantic types as a restriction argument. Since senses for verbs contain a link to a semantic predicate, using this semantic type, the system can then find any/all entries within the lexicon that have this semantic type as the value of the restriction feature of a semantic predicate for any of their senses. As a concrete example, let us continue using the “ticket” scenario from above. The lexical entry for “ticket” might contain a semantic type definition something like in Figure 2. &lt;LexicalEntry ...&gt; &lt;feat att=&amp;quot;POS&amp;quot; val=&amp;quot;N&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;Lemma&gt; &lt;feat a</context>
