Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999713">
We explore the differences in verb
subcategorization frequencies across several
corpora in an effort to obtain stable cross
corpus subcategorization probabilities for
use in nonning psychological experiments.
For the 64 single sense verbs we looked at,
subcategorization preferences were
remarkably stable between British and
American corpora, and between balanced
corpora and financial news corpora. Of the
verbs that did show differences, these
differences were generally found between
the balanced corpora and the financial news
data. We show that all or nearly all of
these shifts in subcategorization are realised
via (often subtle) word sense differences.
This is an interesting observation in itself,
and also suggests that stable cross corpus
subcategorization frequencies may be found
when verb sense is adequately controlled.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889630434783">
Verb subcategorization probabilities play an
important role in both computational linguistic
applications (e.g. Carroll, Minnen, and Briscoe
1998, Charniak 1997, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi
and Srinivas 1994, Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell
1997, Stolcke et al. 1997) and psycholinguistic
models of language processing (e.g. Boland
1997, Clifton et at 1984, Ferreira &amp; McClure
1997, Fodor 1978, Garnsey et al. 1997, Jurafsky
1996, MacDonald 1994, Mitchell &amp; Holmes
1985, Tanenhaus et at 1990, Trueswell et al.
1993).
Previous research, however, has shown that
subcategorization probabilities vary widely in
different corpora. Studies such as Merlo
(1994), Gibson et al. (1996), and Roland &amp;
Jurafsky (1997) have found subcategorization
frequency differences between traditional corpus
data and data from psychological experiments.
Biber (1993) and Biber et al. (1998) have shown
that that word frequency, word sense (as defined
by collocates), the distribution of synonymous
words and the use of syntactic structures varies
with corpus genre. Roland &amp; Jurafsky (1998,
2000 in press) showed that there were
subcategorization frequency differences between
various written and spoken corpora, and
furthermore showed that that these
subcategorization frequency differences are
caused by variation in word sense as well as
genre and discourse type differences among the
corpora.
While the subcategorization probabilities in a
computational language model can be adjusted
to match a particular corpus, cross corpus
differences in such probabilities pose an
important problem when using corpora for
ncrrrning psychological experiments. If each
corpus generates a separate set of probabilities,
which probabilities are the correct ones to use as
a model of human language processing?
In an attempt to use corpora to provide nonning
data for 64 verbs for experimental purposes, we
investigate in detail how verb frequencies and
verb subcategorization frequencies differ among
three corpora: the British National Corpus

(BNC), the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ),
and the Brown Corpus (Brown). For the 64
verbs, we randomly selected a set of sentences
from each corpus and hand-coded them for
transitivity, passive versus active voice, and
whether the selected usage was an instance of
the most common sense of the verb.
We then ask two questions: Do these verbs
have the same subcategorization probabilities
across corpora, and, when there are differences,
what is the cause. If a set of factors causing the
differences can be identified and controlled for,
then a stable set of cross-corpus probabilities
suitable for norming psychological experiments
can be generated.
While previous work has shown that differences
between corpora do exist, and that word sense
differences play a large role in realising these
differences, much less is known about the effect
of other factors on subcategorization variation
across corpora. For example, are there gross
subcategorization differences between British
and American English? To what extent does the
business-genre nature of the Wall Street Journal
corpus affect subcategorization probabilities?
Finally, while Roland and Jurafsky (2000 in
press) suggested that sense differences played a
major role in subcategorization biases, they were
only able to test their hypothesis on a small
number of verbs.
Our eventual goal is an understanding of many
levels of verb differences across corpora,
including verb frequency, frequency of transitive
versus intransitive uses, frequency of other
subcategorization frames, and frequency of
active versus passive use. This paper reports
our preliminary results on the first two of these
issues. Verb usage was surprisingly unaffected
by differences between British and American
English. Those differences that did occur seem
mostly to be caused by differences in the
distribution of verb senses across corpora. The
business-genre nature of the Wall Street Journal
corpus caused certain verbs to appear more often
in particular senses that had a strong effect on its
subcategorization frequencies. Even after
controlling for the broad sense of the verb, we
found subcategorization differences caused by
the &amp;quot;micro-differences&amp;quot; in sense, including quite
specific arguments to the verb.

1 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99276075">
Data for 64 verbs (shown in Table 1) was
collected from three corpora; The British
National Corpus (BNC)
(http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/index.html), the Penn
Treebank parsed version of the Brown Corpus
(Brown), and the Penn Treebank Wall Street
Journal corpus (WSJ) (Marcus et al. 1993).
The 64 verbs were chosen on the basis of the
requirements of separate psychological
experiments including having a single dominant
sense, being easily imagable, and participating
in one of several subcategorization alternations.
A random sample of 100 examples of each verb
was selected from each of the three corpora.
When the corpus contained less than 100 tokens
of the verb, as was frequently the case in the
Brown and WSJ corpora, the entire available
data was used. This data was coded for several
properties: Transitive/Intransitive,
Active/Passive, and whether the example
involved the major sense of the verb or not.
The BNC data was coded entirely by hand,
while the Brown and WSJ was hand coded after
a first pass of subcategorization labelling via a
tgrep search string algorithm. The same coder
labelled the data for all three corpora for any
given verb, in order to reduce any problems in
intercoder reliability.

difference. We would expect factors such as
corpus genre (Business for WSJ vs. mixed for
BNC and Brown), American vs. British English,
and the era the corpus sample was taken in to
influence word frequency.
Table 4- Verbs which WSJ has more of than
both Brown and WSJ:
We are currently examining the nature of the
differences between the British and American
corpora.
We calculated the frequencies for each verb, and
used Chi Square to test whether the difference in
frequency was significant for each corpus
pairing. We then counted the number of verbs
that showed a significant difference using p =
0.05 as a cut-off point This result is shown in
Table 2. Although there were verbs that had a
significant difference in distribution between the
two mixed genre corpora (BNC, Brown), there
were more differences in word frequency
between the general corpora and the business
corpus. The difference between the
BNC/Brown comparison and the BNC and
Brown vs. WSJ comparison is significant (Chi
Square, p &lt; .01).

3.1 Methodology:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
For the second experiment, we coded the
examples of the 64 verbs from each of the three
corpora for transitivity. We counted any use
with a direct object as transitive, and any other
use, such as with a prepositional phrase, as
intransitive. Passive uses were also included in
the transitive category. Examples ( 1 ) and ( 2)
illustrate intransitive uses, example ( 3 )
illustrates transitive (and active) while examples
( 4 ) and ( 5) illustrate transitive (and passive)
uses of the verb &apos;race&apos;.

( 3 ) Lift them from the elbows, and then
drop them down to the floor.
( 4 ) Plans for an OSF binary interface have

( 5 ) It was ... the tinsel paper dropped by
bombers.
Roland and Jurafslcy (2000 in press) showed that
verb sense can affect verb subcategorization.
We therefore controlled for verb sense by only
including sentences from the majority sense of
the verb in our counts. For example, we did
not include instances of drop which were phrasal
verbs with distinct senses like &amp;quot;drop in&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;drop
off&amp;quot;. We did however, include metaphorical
extensions of the main sense, such as a company
&amp;quot;dropping a product line&amp;quot;. We thus used a
broadly defined notion of sense rather than the
more narrowly defined word senses used in
some on-line word sense resources such as
Wordnet This was partly for logistic reasons,
since such fine-grained senses are very hard to
code, and partially because we suspected that
very narrowly defined senses frequently have
only one possible subcategorization. Coding
for such senses would have thus biased our
experiment strongly toward finding a strong link
between sense and subcategorization-bias.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991717">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846923076923">
We calculated transitivity biases for each of the
64 verbs in each of the three corpora. We
classed the verbs as high transitivity if more than
2/3 of the tokens of the major sense were
transitive, low transitivity if more than 2/3 of the
tokens of the major sense were intransitive, and
as mixed otherwise. We removed from
consideration any token of the verb which was
not used in its major sense. If
subcategorization biases are related to verb
sense, we would expect the transitivity biases to
be stable across corpora once secondary senses
are removed from consideration.

3.3 Discussion:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960313055555555">
In general, these shifts in transitivity were a
result of the verbs having differences in sense
between the corpora such that the senses had
different subcategorizations, but were still
within our broadly defined &apos;main sense&apos; for that
verb.
For seven out of the nine verbs, the shifts in
transitivity are a result of differences between
the WSJ data and the other data, which are a
result of the WSJ being biased towards
business-specific uses of these verbs. For
example, in the BNC and Brown data, &apos;advance&apos;
is a mixture of transitive and intransitive uses,
shown in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ), while intransitive share
price changes ( 8) dominated in the WSJ data.
( 6 ) BNC intransitive: In films, they
advance in droves of armour across open
fields ...
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.6302025">
( 7 ) BNC transitive: We have advanced
&amp;quot;moral careers&amp;quot; as another useful concept
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.975025674796748">
( 8 ) WSJ intransitive: Of the 4,345 stocks
that T changed hands, 1,174 declined and
1,040 advanced.
&apos;Crack&apos; is used to mean &apos;make a sound&apos; ( 9 ) or
&apos;break&apos; ( 10 ) in the Brown and BNC data (both
of which have transitive and intransitive uses),
while it is more likely to be used to mean &apos;enter
or dominate a group/market&apos; ( transitive use) in
the WSJ data; ( 11) and ( 12 ).
( 9 ) Brown intransitive: A carbine cracked
more loudly ...
( 10 ) Brown intransitive: Use well-wedged
clay, free of air bubbles and pliable enough to
bend without cracking.
( 11 ) WSJ transitive: But the outsiders
haven&apos;t yet been able to crack Saatchi&apos;s clubby
inner circle, or to have significant influence on
company strategy.
( 12 ) WSJ transitive: ... big investments in
&amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; industries such as beer will make
it even tougher for foreign competitors to
crack the Japanese market.
&apos;Float&apos; is generally used as an intransitive verb
( 13 ), but must be used transitively when used
in a fmancial sense ( 14 ).
( 13 ) Brown intransitive: The ball floated
downstream.
( 14 ) WSJ transitive: B.A.T aims to ... float
its big paper and British retailing businesses
via share issues to existing holders.
`Relax&apos; is generally used intransitively ( 15 ),
but is used transitively in the WSJ data when
discussing the relaxation of rules and credit
( 16 ).
( 15 ) BNC intransitive: The moment Joseph
stepped out onto the terrace the worried faces
of Tran Van Hieu and his wife relaxed with
relief.
( 16 ) WSJ transitive: Ford is willing to bid
for 100% of Jaguar &apos;s shares if both the
government and Jaguar shareholders agree to
relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely.
&apos;Soften&apos; is generally used transitively ( 17 ), but
is used intransitively in the WSJ data when
discussing the softening of prices ( 18 ) and
( 19 ).
( 17 ) Brown transitive: Hardy would not
allow sentiment to soften his sense of the
irredeemable pastness of the past, and the
eternal deadness of the dead.
( 18 ) WSJ intransitive: A spokesman for
Scott says that assuming the price of pulp
continues to soften, `We should do well.&amp;quot;
( 19 ) WSJ intransitive: The stock has since
softened, trading around $25 a share last week
and closing yesterday at $23.00 in national
over-the-counter trading.
`Surrender&apos; is used both transitively ( 20) and
intransitively ( 21 )&gt; but must be used
transitively when discussing the surrender of
particular items such as `stocks&apos; ( 22 ) and ( 23).
( 20 ) BNC transitive: In 1475 Stanley
surrendered his share to the crown...
( 21 ) Brown intransitive: ... the defenders,
to save bloodshed, surrendered under the
promise that they would be treated as
neighbors
( 22 ) WSJ transitive: Holders can ...
surrender their shares at the per-share price of
$1,000, plus accumulated dividends of $6.71 a
share.
( 23 ) WSJ transitive: ... Nelson Peitz and
Peter W. May surrendered warrants and
preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake
in Avery &apos;s common shares.
The verb `fight&apos; is the only verb that has a
different transitivity bias in each of the three
corpora; with all other verbs, at least two
corpora share the same bias. In the WSJ, fight
tends to be used transitively, describing action
against a specific entity or concept ( 24). In
the other two corpora, there are more
descriptions of actions for or against more
abstract concepts ( 25 ) and ( 26). In addition,
the WSJ differences may further be influenced
by a journalistic style practice of dropping the
preposition `against&apos; in the phrase `fight
against&apos;.
( 24 ) WSJ transitive: Los Angeles County
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed to
fight the introduction of double-decking in the
area.
( 25 ) BNC intransitive: He fought against
the United Nations troops in the attempted
ICatangese secession of nineteen sixty to sixty-
two.
( 26 ) Brown intransitive: But he would fight
for his own liberty rather than for any abstract
principle connected with it -- such as &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot;.
The verb `study&apos; is generally transitive ( 27 ),
except in the Brown data, where study is
frequently used with a prepositional phrase
( 28 ) or to generically describe the act of
studying ( 29). We are currently investigating
what might be causing this difference; possible
candidates include language change (since
Brown is much older than BNC and WSJ),
British-American differences, or micro-sense
differences.
( 27 ) BNC transitive: A much more useful
and realistic approach is to study recordings of
different speakers&apos; natural, spontaneous ...
( 28 ) Brown intransitive: In addition, Dr.
Clark has studied at Rhode Island State
College and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
( 29 ) Brown intransitive: She discussed in
her letters to Winslow some of the questions
that came to her as she studied alone.
The verb `flood&apos; is used intransitively more
often in the BNC than in the other corpora.
The Brown and WSJ uses tend to be transitive
non-weather uses of the verb flood ( 30 ) and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999602066666667">
( 31 ), while the BNC uses include more weather
uses, which are more likely to be intransitive
( 32 ). We are investigating whether this is a
result of the BNC discussing weather more often,
or a result of which particular grammatical
structures are used to describe the weather
floods in British and American English.
( 30 ) WSJ transitive: Lawsuits over the
harm caused by DES have flooded federal and
state courts in the past decade.
( 31 ) Brown transitive: The terrible vision
of the ghetto streets flooded his mind.
( 32 ) BNC intransitive: ... should the river
flood, as he &apos;d observed it did after heavy rain,
the house was safe upon its hill.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947851851852">
The goal of the work performed in this paper
was to find a stable set of transitivity biases for
64 verbs to provide norming data for
psychological experiments.
The first result is that 55 out of 64 single sense
verbs analyzed did not change in transitivity bias
across corpora. This suggests that for our goal
of providing transitivity biases for single sense
verbs, the influence of American vs. British
English and broad based vs. narrow corpora may
not be large. We would, however, expect
larger cross corpus differences for verbs that are
more polysemous than our particular set of
verbs.
The second result is that for the 9 out of 64 verbs
that did change in transitivity bias, the shift in
transitivity bias was largely a result of subtle
shifts in verb sense between the genres present
in each corpus. These two results suggest that
when verb sense is adequately controlled for,
verbs have stable subcategorization probabilities
across corpora.
One possible future application of our work is
that it might be possible to use verb frequencies
and subcategorization probabilities of multi-
sense verbs can be used to measure the degree of
difference between corpora.

<abstract confidence="0.997907142857143">We explore the differences in verb subcategorization frequencies across several corpora in an effort to obtain stable cross corpus subcategorization probabilities for use in nonning psychological experiments. For the 64 single sense verbs we looked at, subcategorization preferences remarkably stable between British and American corpora, and between balanced corpora and financial news corpora. Of the verbs that did show differences, these differences were generally found between the balanced corpora and the financial news data. We show that all or nearly all of these shifts in subcategorization are realised via (often subtle) word sense differences. This is an interesting observation in itself, and also suggests that stable cross corpus subcategorization frequencies may be found when verb sense is adequately controlled.</abstract>

Even after controlling for the broad sense of the verb, we found subcategorization differences caused by the &amp;quot;micro-differences&amp;quot; in sense, including quite specific arguments to the verb. 1 Data Data for 64 verbs (shown in Table 1) was collected from three corpora; The British National Corpus (BNC) (http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/index.html), the Penn Treebank parsed version of the Brown Corpus (Brown), and the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) (Marcus et al. 1993). The 64 verbs were chosen on the basis of the requirements of separate psychological experiments including having a single dominant sense, being easily imagable, and participating in one of several subcategorization alternations. A random sample of 100 examples of each verb was selected from each of the three corpora. When the corpus contained less than 100 tokens of the verb, as was frequently the case in the Brown and WSJ corpora, the entire available data was used. This data was coded for several properties: Transitive/Intransitive, Active/Passive, and whether the example involved the majo</context>

While previous work has shown that differences between corpora do exist, and that word sense differences play a large role in realising these differences, much less is known about the effect of other factors on subcategorization variation across corpora. For example, are there gross subcategorization differences between British and American English? To what extent does the business-genre nature of the Wall Street Journal corpus affect subcategorization probabilities? Finally, while Roland and Jurafsky (2000 in press) suggested that sense differences played a major role in subcategorization biases, they were only able to test their hypothesis on a small number of verbs. Our eventual goal is an understanding of many levels of verb differences across corpora, including verb frequency, frequency of transitive versus intransitive uses, frequency of other subcategorization frames, and frequency of active versus passive use. This paper reports our preliminary results on the first two of these issues. Verb usage was surprisingly unaffected by differences between British and American English. Those diffe</context>
