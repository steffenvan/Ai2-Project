<bodyText confidence="0.999846655172414">
This paper deals with knowledge-based text
processing which aims at an intuitive notion
of textual similarity. Entities and relations rel-
evant for a particular domain are identified and
disambiguated by means of semi-supervised
machine learning techniques and resulting an-
notations are applied for computing typed-
similarity of individual texts.
The work described in this paper particularly
shows effects of the mentioned processes in
the context of the *SEM 2013 pilot task on
typed-similarity, a part of the Semantic Tex-
tual Similarity shared task. The goal is to
evaluate the degree of semantic similarity be-
tween semi-structured records. As the evalu-
ation dataset has been taken from Europeana
– a collection of records on European cultural
heritage objects – we focus on computing a se-
mantic distance on field author which has the
highest potential to benefit from the domain
knowledge.
Specific features that are employed in our sys-
tem BUT-TYPED are briefly introduced to-
gether with a discussion on their efficient ac-
quisition. Support Vector Regression is then
used to combine the features and to provide a
final similarity score. The system ranked third
on the attribute author among 15 submitted
runs in the typed-similarity task.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919166666666">
The goal of the pilot typed-similarity task lied in
measuring a degree of semantic similarity between
semi-structured records. The data came from the
Europeana digital library1 collecting millions of
records on paintings, books, films, and other mu-
seum and archival objects that have been digitized
throughout Europe. More than 2,000 cultural and
scientific institutions across Europe have contributed
to Europeana. There are many metadata fields at-
tached to each item in the library, but only fields
title, subject, description, creator, date and source
were used in the task.
Having this collection, it is natural to expect that
domain knowledge on relevant cultural heritage en-
tities and their inter-relations will help to measure
semantic closeness between particular items. When
focusing on similarities in a particular field (a se-
mantic type) that clearly covers a domain-specific
aspect (such as field author/creator in our case), the
significance of the domain knowledge should be the
highest.
Intuitively, the semantic similarity among authors
of two artworks corresponds to strengths of links
that can be identified among the two (groups of)
authors. As the gold standard for the task resulted
from a Mechanical Turk experiment (Paolacci et al.,
2010), it could be expected that close fields corre-
spond to authors that are well known to represent
the same style, worked in the same time or the same
art branch (e. g., Gabri¨el Metsu and Johannes Ver-
meer), come from the same region (often guessed
from the names), dealt with related topics (not nec-
essarily in the artwork described by the record in
question), etc. In addition to necessary evaluation of
the intersection and the union of two author fields
(leading naturally to the Jaccard similarity coeffi-

cient on normalized name records – see below), it
is therefore crucial to integrate means measuring the
above-mentioned semantic links between identified
authors.
Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise in the data
used in the task. Since Europeana does not precisely
define meaning and purpose of each particular field
in the database, many mistakes come directly from
the unmanaged importing process realized by par-
ticipating institutions. Fields often mix content of
various semantic nature and, occasionally, they are
completely misinterpreted (e. g., field creator stands
for the author, but, in many cases, it contains only
the institution the data comes from). Moreover, the
data in records is rather sparse – many fields are left
empty even though the information to be filled in is
included in original museum records (e. g., the au-
thor of an artwork is known but not entered).
The low quality of underlying data can be also
responsible for results reported in related studies.
For example, Aletras et al. (2012) evaluate semantic
similarity between semi-structured items from Euro-
peana. They use several measures including a sim-
ple normalized textual overlap, the extended Lesk
measure, the cosine similarity, a Wikipedia-based
model and the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
The study, restricted to fields title, subject and de-
scription, shows that the best score is obtained by
the normalized overlap applied only to the title field.
Any other combination of the fields decreased the
performance. Similarly, sophisticated methods did
not bring any improvement.
The particular gold standard (training/test data)
used in the typed-similarity task is also problematic.
For example, it provides estimates of location-based
similarity even though it makes no sense for partic-
ular two records – no field mentions a location and
it cannot be inferred from other parts). A through-
out analysis of the task data showed that creator is
the only field we could reasonably use in our exper-
iments (although many issues discussed in previous
paragraphs apply for the field as well). That is why
we focus on similarities between author fields in this
study.
While a plenty of measures for computing tex-
tual similarity have been proposed (Lin, 1998; Lan-
dauer et al., 1998; Sahlgren, 2005; Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007) and there is an active research
in the fields of Textual Entailment (Negri et al.,
2012), Paraphrase Identification (Lintean and Rus,
2010) and, recently, the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity (Agirre et al., 2012), the semi-structured record
similarity is a relatively new area of research. Even
though we focus on a particular domain-specific
field in this study, our work builds on previous re-
sults (Croce et al., 2012; Annesi et al., 2012) to
pre-compute semantic closeness of authors based on
available biographies and other related texts.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The
next section introduces the key domain-knowledge
processing step of our system which aims at recog-
nizing and disambiguating entities relevant for the
cultural heritage domain. The realized system and
its results are described in Section 3. Finally, Sec-
tion 4 briefly summarizes the achievements.

2 Entity Recognition and Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999480807692308">
A fundamental step in processing text in particu-
lar fields lies in identifying named entities relevant
for similarity measuring. There is a need for a
named entity recognition tool (NER) which identi-
fies names and classifies referred entities into pre-
defined categories. We take advantage of such a
tool developed by our team within the DECIPHER
project2.
The DECIPHER NER is able to recognize artists
relevant for the cultural heritage domain and, for
most of them, to identify the branch of the arts they
were primarily focused on (such as painter, sculp-
tors, etc.). It also recognizes names of artworks,
genres, art periods and movements and geograph-
ical features. In total, there are 1,880,985 recog-
nizable entities from the art domain and more than
3,000,000 place names. Cultural-heritage entities
come from various sources; the most productive
ones are given in Table 1. The list of place names
is populated from the Geo-Names database3.
The tool takes lists of entities and constructs a fi-
nite state automaton to scan and annotate input texts.
It is extremely fast (50,000 words per second) and
has a relatively small memory footprint (less than
90 MB for all the data).
Additional information attached to entities is

stored in the automaton too. A normalized form of a
name and its semantic type is returned for each en-
tity. Normalized forms enable identifying equivalent
entities expressed differently in texts, e. g., Gabri¨el
Metsu refers to the same person as Gabriel Metsu,
US can stand for the United States (of America), etc.
Type-specific information is also stored. It includes
a detailed type (e. g., architect, sculptor, etc.), na-
tionality, relevant periods or movements, and years
of birth and death for authors. Types of geographical
features (city, river), coordinates and the GeoNames
database identifiers are stored for locations.
The tool is also able to disambiguate entities
based on a textual context in which they appeared.
Semantic types and simple rules preferring longer
matches provide a primary means for this. For ex-
ample, a text containing Bobigny – Pablo Picasso,
refers probably to a station of the Paris Metro and
does not necessarily deal with the famous Spanish
artist. A higher level of disambiguation takes form
of classification engines constructed for every am-
biguous name from Wikipedia. A set of most spe-
cific terms characterizing each particular entity with
a shared name is stored together with an entity iden-
tifier and used for disambiguation during the text
processing phase. Disambiguation of geographical
names is performed in a similar manner.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999556166666667">
To compute semantic similarity of two non-empty
author fields, normalized textual content is com-
pared by an exact match first. As there is no unified
form defined for author names entered to the field,
the next step applies the NER tool discussed in the
previous section to the field text and tries to identify
all mentioned entities. Table 2 shows examples of
texts from author fields and their respective annota-
tions (in the typewriter font).
Dates and places of birth and death as well as few
specific keywords are put together and used in the
following processing separately. To correctly anno-
tate expressions that most probably refer to names of
people not covered by the DECIPHER NER tool, we
employ the Stanford NER9 that is trained to identify
names based on typical textual contexts.
The final similarity score for a pair of author fields
is computed by means of the SVR combining spe-
cific features characterizing various aspects of the
similarity. Simple Jaccard coefficient on recognized
person names, normalized word overlap of the re-
maining text and its edit distance (to deal with typos)
are used as basic features.
Places of births and deaths, author’s nationality
(e. g., Irish painter) and places of work (active in
Spain and France) provide data to estimate location-
based similarity of authors. Coordinates of each lo-
cation are used to compute an average location for
the author field. The distance between the average
coordinates is then applied as a feature. Since types
of locations (city, state, etc.) are also available, the
number of unique location types for each item and
the overlap between corresponding sets are also em-
ployed as features.
Explicitly mentioned dates as well as information
provided by the DECIPHER NER are compared too.
The time-similarity feature takes into account time
overlap of the dates and time distance of an earlier
and a later event.
Other features reflect an overlap between visual
art branches represented by artists in question (Pho-
tographer, Architect, etc.), an overlap between their
styles, genres and all other information available
from external sources. We also employ a matrix of
artistic influences that has been derived from a large
collection of domain texts by means of relation ex-
traction methods.
Finally, general relatedness of artists is pre-
computed from the above-mentioned collection by
means of Random Indexing (RI), Explicit Seman-
tic Analysis (ESA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) methods, stored in sparse matrices and en-
tered as a final set of features to the SVR process.
The system is implemented in Python and takes

cient implementation of the LDA, and nltk13 for gen-

The resulting system was trained and tested on the
data provided by the task organizers. The train and
test sets consisted each of 750 pairs of cultural her-
itage records from Europeana along with the gold
standard for the training set. The BUT-TYPED sys-
tem reached score 0.7592 in the author field (cross-
validated results, Pearson correlation) on the train-
ing set where 80 % were used for training whereas
20 % for testing. The score for the field on the test-
ing set was 0.7468, while the baseline was 0.4278.

When focusing on similarities in a particular field (a semantic type) that clearly covers a domain-specific aspect (such as field author/creator in our case), the significance of the domain knowledge should be the highest. Intuitively, the semantic similarity among authors of two artworks corresponds to strengths of links that can be identified among the two (groups of) authors. As the gold standard for the task resulted from a Mechanical Turk experiment (Paolacci et al., 2010), it could be expected that close fields correspond to authors that are well known to represent the same style, worked in the same time or the same art branch (e. g., Gabri¨el Metsu and Johannes Vermeer), come from the same region (often guessed from the names), dealt with related topics (not necessarily in the artwork described by the record in question), etc. In addition to necessary evaluation of the intersection and the union of two author fields (leading naturally to the Jaccard similarity coeffi1http://www.europeana.eu/ 119 Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (</context>
