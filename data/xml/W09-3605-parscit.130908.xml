Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999613333333333">
The evaluation of scientific performance is
gaining importance in all research disciplines.
The basic process of the evaluation is peer
reviewing, which is a time-consuming activ-
ity. In order to facilitate and speed up peer
reviewing processes we have developed an
exploratory NLP system in the field of educa-
tional sciences. The system highlights key
sentences, which are supposed to reflect the
most important threads of the article The
highlighted sentences offer guidance on the
content-level while structural elements – the
title, abstract, keywords, section headings –
give an orientation about the design of the ar-
gumentation in the article. The system is im-
plemented using a discourse analysis module
called concept matching applied on top of the
Xerox Incremental Parser, a rule-based de-
pendency parser. The first results are promis-
ing and indicate the directions for the future
development of the system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970327272727">
With the increase of centrally allocated re-
search funding, the growing number of confer-
ences, workshops and journals, the evaluation of
scientific articles has become a central problem
of the scientific community (see for example
Whitley and Gläser, 2007). The evaluation of
articles consists in peer reviewing, i.e. peers’
reading, understanding and commenting the arti-
cles. The peer reviewing process is a matter of
extensive research (e.g. Bornmann 2003, Lu
2005, 2008) discussing its reliability and evalua-
tion methods.
Peer reviewing is a very time-consuming as-
signment, and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) technologies might provide tools that
could shorten the time that peer reviewers take to
process the articles.
Within the 7th framework EU project, Euro-
pean Educational Research Quality Indicators
(http://www.eerqi.eu), we have set up this goal,
and are developing a tool for providing assis-
tance to peer reviewers in educational sciences.
We do not know of any other work with this per-
spective.
Our approach consists in highlighting key sen-
tences in the articles that can be regarded as the
logical backbone of the article. Our tool does not
evaluate, but aims at focusing the evaluator’s
attention on the parts of the texts that are relevant
as a basis for his/her judgment. Nor does this tool
check if the texts conform to some formal norms
of scientific writing.
We regard highlighting key sentences as a
complement to the processing guidance that the
structural layout of the articles provides. The
structural layout of scientific articles – title, ab-
stract, keywords, section headings – guide the
reader in processing the logical, argumentative
and content-wise development of the article at
different levels: The title is the brief indication of
the topic, the keywords yield the conceptual con-
text of the topic, the abstract provides a concise
summary of the problems and results, and the
section headings guide the reader step by step in
the development of the article. Besides these
waymarkers, the highlighted key sentences are
meant to be an intermediary representation of
content development between the title, the key-
words, the abstract and the section headings on
the one hand and the whole article on the other
hand.
Since we define key sentences as those sen-
tences that sum up the main messages of the arti-
cles, and since peer reviewing consists in judging
the scientific value of the main messages, we

assume that highlighting key sentences both
helps understanding and provides evidence for
the peer reviewer’s evaluation. By highlighting
we intend to add a relevant and coherent dimen-
sion of the representation of the flow of the arti-
cle, which is otherwise hidden, and which the
reader has to discover in order to understand the
article.
Highlighting is carried out using the Xerox In-
cremental Parser (XIP), a rule-based dependency
parser (Ait-Mokhtar et al., 2002).
We will first provide a brief review of related
work. This is followed by the description of the
role of structural layout in educational research
articles, which we wish to complement by high-
lighting sentences. In the subsequent sections we
define the attributes of key sentences that serve
as a basis for their detection and describe the
natural language processing system. In the suc-
ceeding section we present our first tests for
validating our approach, and finally we draw
some conclusions and indicate the directions in
which we plan to carry on this work.

Our work is in line with the growing amount of
research in documentation sciences and natural
language processing that takes into account the
argumentative structure of research articles in
tasks such as information retrieval, information
extraction, navigation within documents and
summarization.
In the domain of information retrieval as far
back as the beginning of the 1990’s Liddy (1991)
claimed that additional functions for search in-
struments could benefit from including the dis-
course-level context of the retrieved search terms
in the interpretation of the results. Liddy stressed
the “semantic roles” of concepts in a document
as opposed to the simple occurrence of search
terms. Oddy et al. (1992) proceed in this line of
research and state that discourse-level structures
in research texts could be useful to support re-
trieval for the user because they represent struc-
tural qualities recognized by the reader inde-
pendent of the topic of the research. Both con-
centrate on the analysis of abstracts of research
articles and propose a system to combine topical
with structural information in the retrieval proc-
ess.
Kando (1997) also emphasizes the impor-
tance of the discourse-level context of search
terms in the retrieved documents. The allocation
of retrieved passages to functional units and thus
the possibility to gain information about article
structures provides a valuable opportunity to im-
prove the user’s assessment of the retrieved
documents. A similar method of annotating text
passages according to their function in the text is
conducted by Mizuta et al. (2006) with the objec-
tive of categorizing articles in different document
genres.
Teufel and Moens (2002) base automatic
summarization on extracting sentences annotated
with respect to their discourse function in the
text.
Lisacek et al (2005) detect sentences in bio-
medical articles that describe substantially new
research based on analyzing discourse functions.
Another line of research to exploit the argu-
mentative structure for navigation and informa-
tion extraction is inspired by the semantic web.
Instead of automatically discovering argument
structures in texts, the approach aims at creating
conceptually motivated processing editors in
which the users insert content according to its
argumentative function. (see for example Uren et
al., 2007, Couto and Minel, 2007.)

3 The structure of educational research
articles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832307692308">
Research articles in the educational sciences tend
to display a very heterogeneous structure, like
articles in many other fields in social sciences
and humanities. While the thematic contents of
the articles are structured according to the re-
quirements of the topic, frequent occurrences of
a unifying structure are introductory and con-
cluding chapters. However, where these chapters
appear they do not display uniform headings (cf.
Fiedler, 1991:98). Likewise Ruiying and Allison
(2004) show, for example, that the structure of
research articles in linguistics is does not con-
form to a common model, and section headings
in many cases do not refer to the function of the
chapter but to the thematic contents. Brett (1994)
and Holmes (1997) observe basic structural fea-
tures in the articles in political sciences and soci-
ology. They state, however, that the section
headings are usually not standardized.
In contrast to the heterogeneity of the structure
and section headings of research articles in social
sciences and humanities those in the hard sci-
ences show a relatively uniform structure, and
often follow the well-known pattern of Introduc-
tion – Methods – Results – Discussion, which
renders their reading easier.

<bodyText confidence="0.999631464285715">
The structural heterogeneity of social science
and humanities research articles, and particularly
those within educational sciences, derives from
the coverage of a wide range of research prob-
lems and the consequential variation the methods
applied. This discipline includes theoretically
embedded discussions as well as empirical stud-
ies or material for school praxis. These differ-
ences in the referenced subjects are reflected in
the way the research articles are organized and
presented. Montesi and Owen (2008:151) notice
a high grade of liberty granted by the educational
sciences journals for the presentation of submit-
ted papers. They also describe a clear distinction
between qualitative and quantitative approaches
in research articles, the latter displaying a closer
connection in structural aspects to the exact sci-
ences than the former.
In the framework of this study we compared
the structural properties of fifteen articles from
three journals: the British Journal of Educational
Studies (BJES), the Educational Psychology Re-
view (EPR) and the International Journal of Edu-
cational Research (IJER). These are educational
research journals covering a wide variety of top-
ics from educational psychology to school in-
struction. We have made the following observa-
tions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6693225625">
a) Some section headings follow the functional
structuring of natural science articles, some
do not. About half of the articles contain an
‘Introduction’ and/or a ‘Conclusion’, one
third has a ‘Methods’ section and 26% of the
articles has a section entitled ‘Results’,
‘Findings’ or ‘Conclusion’. Thus a basis for
a functionally orientated article structure can
be perceived in the first and last chapters of
most of the articles. Nearly 60% of the sec-
tion headings, however, are oriented towards
aspects of the content of the articles and
show no predefined form.
b) All of the articles are preceded by an abstract
and eleven of them have keywords assigned
to them.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998835">
The keywords play an important role in our
highlighting approach, since they are sup-
posed to convey the basis for topical rele-
vance. The number of keywords assigned per
article is between two and nine. While some
keywords are applied only a few times in the
article, others are used 60 or even over 100
times. In some cases the keywords are very
common words (‘teachers’, ‘education’) and
they are used frequently throughout the text.
In these cases the highlighted sentences are
supposed to indicate relevant, terminological
uses of those common, non-specialised
words. In other cases the keywords are rare,
but they are terms used in reduced contexts,
for example, terminological expressions re-
lated to the field of research. Those are very
useful for a quick overview over the research
topic. Keywords appearing very rarely or not
at all often belong to a more general level of
terminology.
From an information extraction point of view
the importance of the terms in the thread of
the article is known to be related to their
places of occurrence: in the title, the abstract,
the section headings or even in the titles of
the bibliography terms have more signifi-
cance than in the rest of the article. This
property of terms is used in search options in
digital libraries. An appearance of the query
term in the introduction or conclusion could
also be a hint for the term being relevant for
the scientific context or the results of the
study whereas terms referring to the method-
ology or rather non-specific terms do not
convey much information about the central
contents of the text.
c) The abstract is supposed to sum up the most
important aspects of a research article. The
articles analyzed show that in general the
sentences in the abstract correspond to asser-
tions made throughout the articles in most of
the different sections. In a few cases most
sentences of the abstract were also taken up
in the introductory or concluding part of the
article with a summarizing function.
In this section we have shown that owing to the
large number of research fields in educational
sciences there is a high variety in the structural
design and organisation of the contents of educa-
tional science research articles. In contrast to
research literature in the natural sciences, the
understanding of educational sciences articles is
not promoted by predefined structuring of the
contents. Additionally, a terminological vague-
ness sometimes stands in the way of using key-
words as reliable content indicators. In our ap-
proach we therefore aim at a representation of
article contents independent of the structural
properties of the articles.

evaluations are supposed to make (Bridges
2008).1 We have summed up these judgments as
follows: the relevance of the topic, the clarity of
the problem statement, the coherence of the ar-
gumentation and the well-foundedness of the
conclusions. These criteria of judgment are often
presented as questions in the evaluation forms
that peer reviewers are asked to fill in. Based on
these evaluation criteria we define key sentences
as sentences that describe research problems,
purposes and conclusions related to the topic of
the articles as indicated by the keywords.
The key sentences receive two types of labels in
our system: SUMMARY – the sentences that
convey either the goal or the conclusion - or
PROBLEM – the sentences that mention re-
search problems. Some sentences get both labels.
Labeling is carried out by rules, which rely on
the conceptual definition of SUMMARY and
PROBLEM sentences as we show below.
In order to explain the conceptual definition we
present a series of examples. The following
SUMMARY and PROBLEM sentences are the
first and last three key sentences detected in the
same article (Barrow, 2008). In the first series of
examples the keywords are underlined:
Beginning:

tions concern whether the body provides an

what.
(2) PROBLEM_SUMMARY I do not question
this belief, but in this paper I shall try to
differentiate between and evaluate a num-
ber of quite distinct claims about the impor-
tance of the body in relation to schooling in
general and education in particular.
(3) PROBLEM: However, to assume, as some
philosophers would, that acceptance of that
premise concludes the debate on the ques-
tion of education and the body, by implic-
itly claiming that education has nothing to
do with the body per se, would be absurd.

rationalist philosophers of education are
generally supposed to conclude, that educa-
tion has nothing to do with the body?

<footnote confidence="0.7987722">
1 In a preliminary experiment we tried to identify key sen-
tences in an example-based way. Six scholars marked the
key sentences in four articles from four domains according
to the same evaluation criteria. There were hardly any over-
laps. This led us to define key sentences.
</footnote>
<listItem confidence="0.995839571428571">
(5) PROBLEM: Second, while most of the
claims made about the body and knowledge
are variously opaque, suspect, or clearly
wrong, it remains true that to be fully aware

ballet, you need to engage in it.

to articulate more straightforward argu-
ments for the inclusion of sports and other
forms of bodily activity in the school cur-
riculum than obscure and unconvincing
claims to the effect that they are necessary,
sufficient or even directly relevant to well-
developed and well-rounded educational
understanding.
It is apparent from these sentences that ap-
proaching the task by providing a normalized
factual extraction related to the keywords as in
traditional information extraction would be both
very problematic - even in an intellectual (as op-
posed to automatic) way - and may also be use-
less in the case of an article whose discipline is
not related to describing facts, but rather to argu-
ing about concepts. On the other hand, the hu-
man reader clearly seizes that these sentences do
describe problems, aims and conclusions related
to the underlined keywords.2 In the next step we
define the characteristic features of SUMMARY
and PROBLEM sentences as being conveyed
independently of the factual propositions.
The features of the key sentences are assigned
by applying the concept-matching framework
described in the following series of examples.
This framework had previously been success-
fully used in revealing argumentative functions
of research articles in a text-mining application
of biomedical abstracts (Lisacek et al., 2005) and
in citation-type analysis (Sándor et al., 2006).
(Besides processing scientific articles, concept
matching has also been used in risk detection in
Sándor, 2009.)
The features of key sentences are determined
by the argumentative expressions in the sen-
tences, which in some way comment on the core
factual propositions. In the next series of exam-
ples we have underlined these argumentative
expressions in the same set of sentences:

tionship between the argument types and the keywords: this
relationship remains simple co-occurrence.

understanding.
The detection is based on the words under-
lined. The system recognizes them since they
belong to a database of previously compiled sets
of words. The sets correspond to more or less
loosely understood semantic fields that have
been found to be relevant in scholarly argumen-
tation in the previous applications of the concept-
matching framework. The compilation of the
lists has been entirely manual. Starting from a
small number of seed words we incrementally
extend the list over subsequent analyses and test-
ing. Having worked out a first concept-matching
system, its modification for a new scholarly do-
main takes some weeks provided that a suffi-
ciently large corpus is available. We are carrying
out experiments for automatic enrichment with
the help of Wordnet, but the results have not
been satisfactory up to this point. However, since
the semantic fields concerned contain a relatively
well-identifiable vocabulary within the genre of
scholarly writing, most of these words can be
obtained from textbooks on academic writing.
In the concept-matching framework these sets
of words and expressions are called constituent
concepts. In previous applications nine constitu-
ent concepts have been identified for labeling
argumentative sentences (Sándor, 2007). Out of
these we use five here: MENTAL, IDEA, PUB-
LICATION, DEICTIC, CONTRAST.
In the present system we have used all the
words that have been compiled for labeling ar-
gumentative functions of biomedical research
abstracts, and we have added a few others after
having studied some educational research arti-
cles. Augmenting the list of words in the con-
stituent concepts undoubtedly increases the cov-
erage of the system, although we have found that
the words already compiled yield fairly large
coverage.
In terms of the constituent concepts we define
PROBLEMs as CONTRASTed IDEAs or CON-
TRASTs in MENTAL operations involved in
research, while SUMMARIES of one&apos;s research
goals and conclusions consist in pointing out in
the current (DEICTIC) PUBLICATION one&apos;s
(DEICTIC) IDEAs or MENTAL operations. We
cite now the example sentences only through the
constituent concepts of PROBLEM and SUM-
MARY:

It is apparent that the words that represent the
constituent concepts in these sentential skeletons
constitute purely argumentative expressions and
are void of any factual proposition.

However, not all sentences containing these
words convey the target concepts. Consider for
example the following sentence from a research
article (Meinberg and Stern, 2003.):
(7) Only 1.8% of the claims were attributed to
wrong-site surgery, but 84% of the claims
due to wrong-site surgery resulted in pay-
ment to the plaintiff compared ...
In order to differentiate between relevant and
irrelevant ways of combining the constituent
concepts in a sentence our framework proposes
syntactic criteria: sentences are labeled in case
the constituent concepts are in syntactic depend-
ency relationship with each other. The kind of
syntactic relationship is not specified.
The restriction of syntactic dependencies is
especially relevant in the case when the constitu-
ent concepts are function words (like e.g. not) or
have a general sense (like e.g. work). At this
point we have not measured the impact of this
restriction on recall and precision.
We have built the concept-matching grammar
for labeling argumentation types on top of a gen-
eral-purpose dependency grammar developed in
XIP. In the concept-matching grammar we de-
fine the argumentative expressions as those syn-
tactic dependencies where both words belong to
the particular concepts that constitute the target
concepts as defined above. The only exceptions
to the syntactic constraint are sentential adverbs
(like “however”), for which the XIP grammar
does not extract any syntactic dependencies. The
highlighted sentences are those that contain the
labeled argumentative expressions.

5 First tests

<bodyText confidence="0.999848130434782">
Our exploratory system is based on several con-
secutive hypotheses, the validity of which should
be tested incrementally.
The first hypothesis is that the key sentences
relevant for peer reviewing are those that de-
scribe the problems, aims and results in the arti-
cles, and that these sentences contain the key-
words provided with the articles. The second
hypothesis is that these sentences can be detected
using the concept-matching grammar. Finally the
third hypothesis is that highlighting these sen-
tences can save peer reviewers’ time evaluating
articles.
Owing to the complexity and relative vague-
ness of the task, we have not been able to set up
either a formal or a statistically significant
evaluation up to now. For this article we have
carried out an initial internal test3 towards the
validation of the first two hypotheses.
In a test corpus of five articles from the three
educational research journals mentioned in Sec-
tion 3 (BJES, EPR, IJES) we checked if the sen-
tences highlighted by the system convey relevant
information in the argumentative development of
the paper and if we find other key sentences that
are not highlighted. Next we analyzed the causes
of silence and noise in order to evaluate our basic
assumptions.
Table 1 summarizes the results of the test
over the five articles in terms of recall and preci-
sion of the key sentences, and also indicates the
percentage of key sentences out of all the sen-
tences in the articles. Recall is defined as the
number of correct sentences highlighted divided
by the total number of sentences that we consid-
ered to be key sentences. Precision is defined as
the number of correct sentences highlighted di-
vided by the total number of sentences high-
lighted.
Table 2 shows if the missing sentences identi-
fied as key sentences by the evaluator contain
keywords or not. It also displays the number of
missing sentences in each article by type of error.
Table 3 shows the number of false positive sen-
tences according to the types of the causes of the
error.

of the framework for the task
We can observe significant differences accord-
ing to the journals with respect to both hypothe-
ses that we have tested. The three journals deal
with rather different research topics ranging from
theoretical discussions to empirical studies of
students´ behavior. According to our results the
important passages of these articles are charac-
terized by different attributes: while in empirical
studies more or less definite results can be pre-
sented, theoretical discussions rest more on a
discursive level offering less clear conclusions to
be identified as SUMMARY or PROBLEM sen-
tences. This is reflected on the one hand in the
differences in recall and precision among the
journals and on the other hand in the differences
in the number of sentences missing due to error-
type 3 in Table 2.
In the EPR and in the IJER we found more
key sentences that are neither SUMMARY nor
PROBLEM sentences according to our definition
than in the BJES. Most of these sentences con-
vey definitions related to the key concept. Thus
our first hypothesis seems to hold more for em-
pirical studies than for theoretical ones. In order
to increase the coverage of key sentences the
system should be completed so that it also de-
tects definitions, especially in the case of theo-
retical articles.
As for the presence of keywords in the key
sentences, our results show that this is a relevant
condition, however not necessary since a number
of key sentences identified do not contain key-
words. Further study is needed to identify the
characteristic features of key sentences without
keywords. We have carried out an additional test
to see if the correct key sentences cover all the
keywords in the list. In the five articles we have
only found one keyword that was not present in
any of the key sentences, but this word appeared
only once in the whole article. The fact that rela-
tively few sentences are detected in the articles
and that in these sentences all the keywords are
covered supports the hypothesis that the key sen-
tences do play an important role in the thread of
the article.
Among the errors leading to both silence and
noise we have found a number of cases where
the concept-matching framework in its present
form is not convenient for the task of detecting
key sentences that satisfy the conditions or filter-
ing erroneous sentences. The reason for this in
both cases is that the unit of concept-matching is
the sentence, whereas in these cases a single sen-
tence does not provide enough context for identi-
fying or for specifying the target concepts re-
spectively. Since the number of errors due to this
reason is not very high we do not consider that
these results invalidate the second hypothesis.
The number of such false positives is quite sig-
nificant, however, which might be disturbing for
the user of the system. This kind of error could
be overcome by enlarging the scope of concept-
matching beyond the sentence. In this way we
could filter out these false positives.
In a significant number of cases noise is not
due to an error in the system but to the fact that
the sentence is not important enough with respect
to the development of the whole article. Whether
this kind of noise is a significant disturbing fac-
tor for the user is to be tested in subsequent
evaluation by users.
Finally, we have found few errors due to bugs
in the grammar, which indicates that the recogni-
tion of SUMMARY and PROBLEM sentences is
relatively reliable. These results also contribute
to suggesting that the second hypothesis seems to
hold.

In this article we have presented an exploratory
system for highlighting key sentences containing
keywords in order to support peer review. The
selected sentences are supposed to help peer re-
viewers of articles in educational sciences to fo-
cus their attention on some relevant textual evi-
dence for formulating their judgments. We have
argued that even if the structural characteris-
tics— the abstract, the keywords and the section
headings—guide the reader in following the de-
velopment of the article, content-oriented high-
lighting of key sentences might enhance the
quick understanding of the core contents.
Although the subjects of educational science
research articles display very heterogeneous
structures and contents, the system could identify
a number of sentences containing the main
statements of the articles. Text-inherent devel-
opments not accompanied by structural signs like
the outcomes of empirical studies or the contents
of a theoretical discussion about abstract terms
could be identified using automatic text analysis,
which can possibly save intellectual effort of sci-
entists. The time-consuming task of reviewing a
growing number of research publications, hardly
manageable when studying each submitted
manuscript thoroughly, could thus be facilitated
and supported and less threatened to be replaced
by wholly automatic metric systems when time
constraints become more severe.
The method we have developed is imple-
mented in XIP, a rule-based dependency parser.
It uses pre-existing lexical resources and applies
the concept-matching framework.
The results of our first tests suggest that two of
our three initial hypotheses are partially valid.
According to our first hypothesis the key sen-
tences relevant for peer reviewing are those that
describe the problems, aims and results in the
articles. We have found that sentences conveying
definitions, especially in theoretical articles,
should also be highlighted as key sentences. The
second hypothesis is that these sentences can be
detected using the concept-matching grammar.
We have found in the majority of cases that this
hypothesis is valid, however, enlarging the unit
of concept-matching to multiple sentences would
improve the performance.
Based on this result we are undertaking a user
evaluation to measure the time needed to peer
review these articles with and without highlight-
ing. We are also planning to extend the system
in the two directions suggested by the test re-
sults.
Besides providing assistance to peer reviewers
the system presented here could be used in other
applications, which we would like to explore in
future projects. The possibilities include improv-
ing search functionalities in digital libraries, dis-
playing electronic documents by linking key-
words to key sentences and discourse-based
navigation.

The basic process of the evaluation is peer reviewing, which is a time-consuming activity. In order to facilitate and speed up peer reviewing processes we have developed an exploratory NLP system in the field of educational sciences. The system highlights key sentences, which are supposed to reflect the most important threads of the article The highlighted sentences offer guidance on the content-level while structural elements – the title, abstract, keywords, section headings – give an orientation about the design of the argumentation in the article. The system is implemented using a discourse analysis module called concept matching applied on top of the Xerox Incremental Parser, a rule-based dependency parser. The first results are promising and indicate the directions for the future development of the system.</abstract>

These criteria of judgment are often presented as questions in the evaluation forms that peer reviewers are asked to fill in. Based on these evaluation criteria we define key sentences as sentences that describe research problems, purposes and conclusions related to the topic of the articles as indicated by the keywords.

This discipline includes theoretically embedded discussions as well as empirical studies or material for school praxis. These differences in the referenced subjects are reflected in the way the research articles are organized and presented. Montesi and Owen (2008:151) notice a high grade of liberty granted by the educational sciences journals for the presentation of submitted papers. They also describe a clear distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches in research articles, the latter displaying a closer connection in structural aspects to the exact sciences than the former. In the framework of this study we compared the structural properties of fifteen articles from three journals: the British Journal of Educational Studies (BJES), the Educational Psychology Review (EPR) and the International Journal of Educational Research (IJER).

In the domain of information retrieval as far back as the beginning of the 1990’s Liddy (1991) claimed that additional functions for search instruments could benefit from including the discourse-level context of the retrieved search terms in the interpretation of the results. Liddy stressed the “semantic roles” of concepts in a document as opposed to the simple occurrence of search terms. Oddy et al. (1992) proceed in this line of research and state that discourse-level structures in research texts could be useful to support retrieval for the user because they represent structural qualities recognized by the reader independent of the topic of the research.

While the thematic contents of the articles are structured according to the requirements of the topic, frequent occurrences of a unifying structure are introductory and concluding chapters. However, where these chapters appear they do not display uniform headings (cf. Fiedler, 1991:98). Likewise Ruiying and Allison (2004) show, for example, that the structure of research articles in linguistics is does not conform to a common model, and section headings in many cases do not refer to the function of the chapter but to the thematic contents. Brett (1994) and Holmes (1997) observe basic structural features in the articles in political sciences and sociology. They state, however, that the section headings are usually not standardized.

We are carrying out experiments for automatic enrichment with the help of Wordnet, but the results have not been satisfactory up to this point. However, since the semantic fields concerned contain a relatively well-identifiable vocabulary within the genre of scholarly writing, most of these words can be obtained from textbooks on academic writing. In the concept-matching framework these sets of words and expressions are called constituent concepts. In previous applications nine constituent concepts have been identified for labeling argumentative sentences (Sándor, 2007). Out of these we use five here: MENTAL, IDEA, PUBLICATION, DEICTIC, CONTRAST. In the present system we have used all the words that have been compiled for labeling argumentative functions of biomedical research abstracts, and we have added a few others after having studied some educational research articles. Augmenting the list of words in the constituent concepts undoubtedly increases the coverage of the system, although we have found that the words already compiled yield fairly large coverage.
