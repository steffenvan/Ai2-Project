The accelerating growth in biomedical literature has
stimulated activity on automated classification of
and information extraction from this literature. The
work described here attempts to improve on an ear-
lier classification study associating biological arti-
cles to GO codes. It demonstrates the need, under
particular assumptions, for more access to full text
articles and for the use of Part-of-Speech tagging.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993417441176471">
The accelerating growth in biomedical literature is
stimulating efforts both to screen individual papers
quickly for useful information and to use aggrega-
tions of papers for the collective information they
provide. Aggregative use may involve what one
might call “binning” classification, where one de-
cides which of N bins an entity should be slotted
into (Raychaudhuri et al., 2002). Most often these
tasks have been done on titles and abstracts, simply
because that is what is most freely available. How-
ever the nature of titles and abstracts means that they
may lack information that is relevant to the task.
The present study considers this issue, taking
as its starting point work done by Raychaudhuri,
Chang, Sutphin and Altman (2002). In this work:
(i) articles were associated with GO codes; and then
(ii) GO codes were assigned to new genes on the ba-
sis of the GO-code associations with articles about
related genes. This paper reconsiders the basis for
Step (i), to see if this can be done more accurately,
using full text rather than titles and abstracts.
Raychaudhuri et al. (2002) investigated how sta-
tistical natural language techniques could be applied
to assign GO codes to genes using the titles and ab-
stracts of articles about related genes. GO codes
are terms drawn from three controlled vocabular-
ies (biological processes, cellular components and
molecular functions) developed by the Gene Ontol-
ogy Consortium (Ashburner et al., 2000). The Gene
Ontology Consortium’s aim is for gene products to
be described in a consistent manner across indepen-
dent databases and species. Each controlled vocabu-
lary is organised as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
The GO codes that Raychaudhuri et al. chose to
assign to articles (and hence to genes) were from
the biological process vocabulary, an approximate
horizontal cut through the biological process DAG.
However, some departures were made from the hor-
izontal when the authors found difficulties in pre-
cisely defining the associated literature. In depart-
ing from the horizontal, parent/child dependencies
were introduced. For example, GO code transport
is a parent of intracellular protein traffic.
MEDLINE queries on these GO codes were man-
ually created in order to retrieve approximately
1000 articles related to each topic. The queries con-
tained both MeSH terms and keywords. Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH) (Hutchinson, 1998) is a
controlled vocabulary from the National Library of
Medicine used to aid indexing and searching bio-
logical information. MEDLINE articles are indexed
by MeSH headings, among other annotations. The
PubMed search tool allows a user to specify desired
search fields, of which Raychaudhuri et al. used title
(TI), Major MeSH Heading (MAJR), MeSH Head-
ing (MH) and date of publication (DP). The first
three fields were used to specify the subject of the
article while the DP field was used to limit the num-
ber of articles retrieved to approximately 1000.
Raychaudhuri et al. experimented with three ma-
chine learning approaches (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest
Neighbours and Maximum Entropy) to classify ar-
ticles according to the 21 GO codes. Each classifier
was trained on articles retrieved using the described
queries from 1999 and earlier, and tested on arti-
cles from 2000. Maximum Entropy was found to be
the most successful at classifying articles, achieving
72.83% accuracy.

2.1 Data
2.1.1 Full Text Access
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998260625">
PubMed gives access to information in MEDLINE
- the title and abstract of articles along with man-
ual annotations such as MeSH Headings and Reg-
istry Numbers. PubMed Central1, on the other hand,
gives access to the full text (in HTML) of (currently
98) journals that are indexed in MEDLINE. Also,
many other publishers are now making their jour-
nal articles available online for free on their own
sites. PubMed Central will also list articles from
these publishers.
BioMed Central (BMC) is another resource for
full text articles. BMC, like PubMed Central, con-
tains full text from many journals as well as having
many of its own online journals. Authors can sub-
mit articles to these BMC journals and have them
reviewed and published in the same month2.

2.1.2 Full Text Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984545454546">
The same queries that were used in the Raychaud-
huri et al. study were used to query PubMed Cen-
tral in order to find full text articles relating to the
21 biological process GO codes. The DP field was
omitted, in order to access as many full text articles
as possible. For some of the 21 GO codes, there
were not enough free full text articles available to
be deemed representative and so only those codes
that had 50+ full text articles associated with them
were used in the rest of the study. These can be seen
in Table 1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.915571">
2.1.3 Article Sections
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996019375">
Most journals have a format to which authors must
adhere in order for an article to be considered for
publication, including rules concerning the naming
of sections.
With respect to the structure of scientific papers
(or, more specifically, papers in biology), many peo-
ple talk about them having a canonical structure
consisting of a Title, Abstract, Introduction, Mate-
rials and Methods, Results, and Discussion in either
this order or with Materials and Methods at the end.
For the experiments reported here, those arti-
cles were extracted from the full text of journals
that adhere closely to this canonical structure and
other sections were ignored. Sections named sim-
ply Methods were included with the Materials and
Methods sections.

Because the current study concerns whether NLP
techniques can help to improve performance of clas-
sification, we have postponed experimenting with
different machine learning techniques. We will do
so after we find which NLP techniques are the most
useful. The Rainbow3 Naive Bayes classification
tool was used.
Raychaudhuri et al. induced a single N-ary clas-
sifier, whereas this study induced 21 binary classi-
fiers, i.e. an article was classified as either being re-
lated to a particular biological process or unrelated.

2.2.2 NLP techniques
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945153846154">
We applied both Part-of-Speech tagging and stem-
ming. The LT-TTT tagger (Grover et al., 2000) was
used to tag the part of speech each word belonged
to. This allowed us to experiment with building
classifiers based only on single parts of speech as
well as ones based on all words.
The most widely used stemmer among the NLP
community is the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980). A
Perl version of this was used to produce stemmed
sets of the articles.
We experimented with four strategies to find the
best performance in classification: bag of words;
bag of nouns; bag of stems; bag of stemmed nouns.

2.2.3 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903555555556">
There were too few full text articles to both train and
test on, so the classifiers were trained on the original
titles and abstract articles from Raychaudhuri et al.
and then tested on the full text and sections thereof.
The negative training instances for each category
were those articles that were related to the other cat-
egories (approx 2000). Four sets of classifiers were
trained: one set each for the bags of words, nouns,
stems and stemmed nouns.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996485106383">
Classification results are shown in Table 2. This ta-
ble shows the recall, precision and F-score for each
section of text and for each of the four word-bag
types. The first line of the table corresponds to Ray-
chaudhuri et al.’s strategy using Naive Bayes instead
of Maximum Entropy. The F-score is calculated
giving equal weighting to recall and precision.
Titles achieved the best F-score - this occurs be-
cause the precision was much higher than the other
sections. This is not unexpected since there would
be very little room for false indicators in the rela-
tively short Title section. The other sections have
more scope for introducing negative indicators. Ti-
tles consistently had lower recall in comparison
with the other sections. Obviously a title can only
convey the one or two main points of an article and
not include every relevant topic.
The Methods section was expected to fare worse
than other sections, since it contains more techni-
cal data, such as investigative techniques, chemi-
cals and measurements, than information about bi-
ological processes. However, performance on the
Methods section was on a par with the Abstract and
Introduction, suggesting that the Methods sections
may give the reasoning behind certain experiments.
This is in contrast to Shah et al.’s (2003) conclusion
that the Methods section was not valuable for the ex-
traction of keywords relating to biological concepts
compared with the other sections.
The Introduction section can conceivably contain
any type of information, including similar/opposite
studies, ultimate goal of the present study, other pro-
cesses related to the gene(s)/protein(s) in question
and so can have many positive and negative indi-
cators of category. Thus, a similar performance to
Abstracts and Methods is not to be unexpected.
The Results section generally produced the worst
performance. This could be considered surprising
since here is where one would expect the proof of
biological processes occurring in experimentation.
This outcome may be because no reasoning is made
about the results at this point. Also there are fre-
quent indicators against a category, when a biologi-
cal process is found not to be affected in the exper-
iment and is so stated, e.g. “Biogenesis of the vac-
uole is not obviously disturbed in aut9 cells” (Lang
et al., 2000). Explicit negative information is im-

portant for biologists, so that they do not to waste
resources by repeating work that has already been
investigated. On the other hand, it has an adverse
affect on classification.
The whole full text achieved both the best recall
and the worst precision. The full text has maximum
potential for including positive indicators of biolog-
ical process just as it has maximum potential for in-
cluding misleading indicators.
All individual sections except Titles underper-
formed in comparison with the baseline of Title
and Abstract with regard to equally-weighted F-
score. (See Section 4 for discussion of alternatives
to equally-weighted F-score.) Similarly, nouns,
stemmed words and stemmed nouns all produced a
lower equally-weighted F-score than did the base-
line of bag of words. Discussion was the only sec-
tion dataset to outperform the Title and Abstract
with regards to recall, while no section significantly
bettered Title and Abstract on precision except Ti-
tles alone.

3.3 Evaluation of stemming and POS-tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999655">
While both training and testing on nouns and stems
increased the performance compared to simply us-
ing a bag of words, combining these two techniques
seemed to interfere with their individual usefulness.
The combination - first retrieving the nouns and then
stemming them - achieved an increase in recall com-
pared with just stemming, however recall was de-
creased compared with just using nouns.
The trend between classifying with words and
nouns differed depending on whether they are
stemmed or not. Recall generally increased and pre-
cision generally decreased when going from classi-
fying with whole words to classifying with stemmed
words. In contrast, recall decreased and precision
increased when going from classifying with nouns
to classifying with stemmed nouns.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982710526316">
The increase in performance using the Discussion
sections as compared with the Title and Abstract
does not perhaps seem significant enough to war-
rant the effort involved in retrieving and processing
the HTML of the full text. However, this study was
based on the classifiers being trained on the titles
and abstracts, and so further studies are currently
ongoing with full text and sections thereof being
used to both train and test the classifiers.
The nature of the data is such that, for any class,
the number of negative instances far exceeds the
number of positive instances. Thus, the low preci-
sion scores were influenced by the amount of nega-
tive instances in the test data. For example, if a cat-
egory had 100 positive instances, it also had approx
850 negative test instances. If 1 out of every 10 neg-
ative instances were incorrectly classified as posi-
tive, and 1 out of every 5 positive instances were in-
correctly classified as negative, recall would be 80%
and precision would be 48.5%. However, if the test
data included 400 negative instances with the same
error rates, precision would increase to 66.7%.
If the role of this classification task is as a first-
pass filter, then recall is more important than preci-
sion, as we want to minimise the loss to false neg-
atives. As such, it would perhaps be more indica-
tive of the performance of the classifiers to actually
calculate an F-score that gives more weight to re-
call. For example, triple-weighting recall promotes
nouns as classifiers, with Title and Abstract F-scores
becoming 66.3% (words), 69.9% (nouns), 66.9%
(stemmed words) and 69.8% (stemmed nouns). A
triple-weighted recall F-score also promotes the
Discussion section as the basis for classification,
with F-scores of 66.6%, 69.9%, 66.1%, 69.4% re-
spectively. These scores may be more representa-
tive of the relative benefit of stemming and POS-
tagging.

The Results section generally produced the worst performance. This could be considered surprising since here is where one would expect the proof of biological processes occurring in experimentation. This outcome may be because no reasoning is made about the results at this point. Also there are frequent indicators against a category, when a biological process is found not to be affected in the experiment and is so stated, e.g. “Biogenesis of the vacuole is not obviously disturbed in aut9 cells” (Lang et al., 2000). Explicit negative information is im68 portant for biologists, so that they do not to waste resources by repeating work that has already been investigated. On the other hand, it has an adverse affect on classification. The whole full text achieved both the best recall and the worst precision. The full text has maximum potential for including positive indicators of biological process just as it has maximum potential for including misleading indicators. All individual sections except Titles underperformed in comparison with the baseline of Title and Abstract with regard to equally-weighted Fsco</context>

Raychaudhuri et al. induced a single N-ary classifier, whereas this study induced 21 binary classifiers, i.e. an article was classified as either being related to a particular biological process or unrelated. 2.2.2 NLP techniques We applied both Part-of-Speech tagging and stemming. The LT-TTT tagger (Grover et al., 2000) was used to tag the part of speech each word belonged to. This allowed us to experiment with building classifiers based only on single parts of speech as well as ones based on all words. The most widely used stemmer among the NLP community is the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980). A Perl version of this was used to produce stemmed sets of the articles. We experimented with four strategies to find the best performance in classification: bag of words; bag of nouns; bag of stems; bag of stemmed nouns. 2.2.3 Training There were too few full text articles to both train and test on, so the classifiers were trained on the original titles and abstract articles from Raychaudhuri et al. and then tested on the full text and sections thereof. The negative training instances for each category were those articles that were related to the other categories (approx 2000). Four sets of</context>

It demonstrates the need, under particular assumptions, for more access to full text articles and for the use of Part-of-Speech tagging. 1 Introduction The accelerating growth in biomedical literature is stimulating efforts both to screen individual papers quickly for useful information and to use aggregations of papers for the collective information they provide. Aggregative use may involve what one might call “binning” classification, where one decides which of N bins an entity should be slotted into (Raychaudhuri et al., 2002). Most often these tasks have been done on titles and abstracts, simply because that is what is most freely available. However the nature of titles and abstracts means that they may lack information that is relevant to the task. The present study considers this issue, taking as its starting point work done by Raychaudhuri, Chang, Sutphin and Altman (2002). In this work: (i) articles were associated with GO codes; and then (ii) GO codes were assigned to new genes on the basis of the GO-code associations with articles about related genes. This paper reconsiders the basis for Step (i), to see if </context>
