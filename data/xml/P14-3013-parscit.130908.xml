Recently, we reported on our efforts to

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999914821428571">
WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in nu-
merous natural language processing tasks such as
word sense disambiguation and information ex-
traction with considerable success. Motivated by
this success, many projects have been undertaken
to build similar lexical databases for other lan-
guages. Among the large-scale projects are Eu-
roWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et
al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWord-
Net (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages.
Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of
languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geo-
graphical region spanning the intersections of Iran,
Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1).
Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which,
among other resources, no wordnet has been built
yet.
Despite having a large number (20 to 30 mil-
lions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012;
Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the
less-resourced languages for which the only lin-
guistic resource available on the Web is raw
text (Walther and Sagot, 2010). In order to ad-
dress this resource-scarceness problem, the Kur-
dish language processing project (KLPP1) has
been recently launched at University of Kurdis-
tan. Among the the major linguistic resources that
KLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a

WordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish lan-
guage. Earlier this year, we reported (Aliabadi
et al., 2014) on our effort to build the first pro-
totype of KurdNet. In this paper, we propose a
plan to transform this preliminary version into a
full-fledged and functional lexical database.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We first (in Section 2) give a brief overview of the
current state of KurdNet. Then after highlighting
the main shortcomings of the current prototype in
Section 3, we present our plan to transform this
prototype to a full-blown lexical database for the
Kurdish language in Section 4. We conclude the
paper in Section 5.

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977846">
2.1 Scope
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943857142857">
Kurdish has two main dialects (Esmaili and
Salavati, 2013): Sorani and Kurmanji. In the first
prototype of KurdNet we focus only on the So-
rani dialect. This is mainly due to lack of an avail-
able and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary.
Moreover, processing Sorani is in general more
challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987797">
2.2 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941">
There are two well-known models for building
wordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978502">
• Expand: in this model, the synsets are built
in correspondence with the WordNet synsets
and the semantic relations are directly im-
ported. It has been used for Italian in Mul-
tiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet.
• Merge: in this model, the synsets and rela-
tions are first built independently and then
they are aligned with WordNet’s. It has been
the dominant model in building BalkaNet and
EuroWordNet.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999602842105263">
The expand model seems less complex and
guarantees the highest degree of compatibility
across different wordnets. But it also has potential
drawbacks. The most serious risk is that of forcing
an excessive dependency on the lexical and con-
ceptual structure of one of the languages involved,
as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996).
In our project, we follow the Expand model,
since it can be partly automated and therefore
would be faster. More precisely, we aim at cre-
ating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the Base
Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of
5,000 essential concepts (i.e. synsets) that play
a major role in the wordnets. Base Concepts
(BC) is available on the Global WordNet Associa-
tion (GWA)’s Web page2. The Entity-Relationship
(ER) model for the data represented in Base Con-
cept is shown in Figure 2. A sample synset is de-
picted in Figure 3.

2.3 Elements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961210526316">
Since KurdNet follows the Expand model, it
inherits most of Base Concepts’ structural prop-
erties, including: synsets and the lexical relations
among them, POS, Domain, BCS, and SUMO.
KurdNet’s language-specific aspects, on the other
hand, have been built using a semi-automatic
approach. Below, we elaborate on the details of
construction the remaining three elements.
Synset Alignments: for each synset in
BC, its counterpart in KurdNet is defined
semi-automatically. We first use Dictio (a Sorani-
English dictionary, see Section 4.2) to translate its
literals (words). Having compiled the translation
lists, we combine them in two different ways:
(i) a maximal alignment (abbr. max) which is a
superset of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment
(abbr. min) which is a subset of non-empty
lists. Figure 4 shows an illustration of these two
combination variants. In future, we plan to apply

more advanced techniques, similar to the graph
algorithms described in (Flati and Navigli, 2012).
Usage Examples: we have taken a corpus-
assisted approach to speed-up the process of
providing usage examples for each aligned synset.
To this end, we: (i) extract all sentences (820,203)
of the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013),
(ii) lemmatize the corpus to extract all the lemmas
(278,873), and (iii) construct a lemma-to-sentence
inverted index. In the current version of KurdNet,
for each synset we build a pool of sentences
by fetching the first 5 sentences of each of its
literals from the inverted list. These pools will
later be assessed by lexicographers to filter out
non-relevant instances. In future, more sophisti-
cated approaches can be applied (e.g., exploiting
contextual information).
Definitions: due to lack of proper translation
tools, this element was aligned manually. We
built a graphical user interface to facilitate the
lexicographers’ task.
Table 1 shows a summary of KurdNet’s statisti-
cal properties along with those of Base Concepts.
The latest snapshot of KurdNet’s prototype is
freely accessible and can be obtained from (KLPP,
2013).

3 KurdNet: Shortcomings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759">
The current version of KurdNet is quite basic and
therefore its applicability is very limited. In order
to expand the usability of KurdNet, the following
shortcomings must be overcome:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.786106" genericHeader="method">
3.1 Incomplete Coverage of Kurdish
Vocabulary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999755916666667">
KurdNet has been built as an alignment for Base
Concepts and since Base Concepts contains only
a small subset of English vocabulary, KurdNet’s
coverage is inevitably small. Furthermore, as it
can be seen in Table 1, due to the limitations of
the dictionaries used, not all English words in the
Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) have an equiv-
alent in KurdNet. Hence the current mapping be-
tween WordNet and KurdNet is only partial. Fi-
nally, the lexical idiosyncrasies between Kurdish
and English should be identified and included in
KurdNet.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9867335">
3.2 Refinement of Automatically-Generated
Content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887888888889">
Each synset must contain a comprehensive defini-
tion and a practical example. While KurdNet def-
initions are provided manually and therefore en-
joy high quality, the actual words in each synset
as well as the usage examples have been produced
manually. In order to increase the reliability and
correctness of KurdNets, there need to be mech-
anisms to refine the existing machine-generated
components.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961962">
3.3 Limited Support for Semantic Relation
Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858714285714">
As shown in Table 2, there are several WordNet
semantic relations for each syntactic categories.
Each syntactic categories are organized to compo-
nent files (Miller et al., 1993). The most impor-
tant semantic relation in WordNet is Hyponymy
and this relation is the only one support in Kurd-
Net (Aliabadi et al., 2014).

3.4 Absence of Kurmanji Synsets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991090909091">
Kurdish is considered a bi-standard3 lan-
guage (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012):
the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based
alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a
Latin-based alphabet. The linguistics features
distinguishing these two dialects are phonolog-
ical, lexical, and morphological. The important
morphological differences that concern the con-
struction of KurdNet are (MacKenzie, 1961;
Haig and Matras, 2002): (i) in contrast to Sorani,
Kurmanji has retained both gender (feminine
v. masculine) and case opposition (absolute v.
oblique) for nouns and pronouns, and (ii) while
is Kurmanji passive voice is constructed using
the helper verb “hatin”, in Sorani it is created via
verb morphology. As explained in Section 2, the
current KurdNet prototype only covers the Sorani
dialect and therefore it should be extended to
include the Kurmanji dialect as well. This would
require not only using similar resources to those
reported in this paper, but also building a mapping
system between the Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.

3.5 Dictionary Imperfections

Dictio, the dictionary that was used for building
KurdNet, is relatively small. We have recently
discovered new linguistics resources that can im-
prove the quality of automatic translation of En-
glish words and sentences into Kurdish and vice
versa (see Section 4.2).

4.3 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994655">
As mentioned in Section 2, we have adopted
the Expand model to build KurdNet. According
to (Vossen, 1996), the MultiWordNet (MWN11)
model (Expand model) seems less complex and
guarantees the highest degree of compatibility
across different wordnets. The MWN model also
has potential drawbacks. The most serious risk
is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the
lexical and conceptual structure of one of the lan-
guages involved, as (Vossen, 1996) points out.
This risk can be considerably reduced by allow-
ing the new wordnet to diverge, when necessary,
from the PWN.
Another important advantage of the MWN
model is that automatic procedures can be devised
to speed up both the construction of correspond-
ing synsets and the detection of divergences be-
tween PWN and the wordnet being built. Accord-
ing to the Expand model, the aim is to build, when-
ever possible, Kurdish synsets which are synony-
mous (semantically correspondent) with the PWN
synsets. The second strategy is based on Kurdish-
to-English translations. For each sense of a Kur-
dish word K, we look for a PWN synset S in-
cluding at least one English translation of K and
a link between K and S is established (Pianta et
al., 2002).
For the correct alignment of Sorani and Kur-
manji synsets, we propose to use three comple-
mentary approaches:
</bodyText>

• use of English (here, Base Concepts) synsets

Based on our estimates, we plan to carry out the
research highlighted in this paper in the course of
one-and-an-half to two years. To this end, a time-
line has been prepared (see Figure 5). We believe
that since the preliminary work on KurdNet (e.g.,
literature review, development of the first proto-
type) has already been completed, most of our re-
sources will be dedicated to designing new algo-
rithms and system building.
Moreover, in terms of technical logistics, we
are hopeful to receive full IT and library systems
support from the Science and Research Branch Is-
lamic Azad University(SRBIAU12) and University

In order to address this resource-scarceness problem, the Kurdish language processing project (KLPP1) has been recently launched at University of Kurdistan. Among the the major linguistic resources that KLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a 1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of Kurdish Speakers WordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish language. Earlier this year, we reported (Aliabadi et al., 2014) on our effort to build the first prototype of KurdNet. In this paper, we propose a plan to transform this preliminary version into a full-fledged and functional lexical database. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first (in Section 2) give a brief overview of the current state of KurdNet. Then after highlighting the main shortcomings of the current prototype in Section 3, we present our plan to transform this prototype to a full-blown lexical database for the Kurdish language in Section 4. We conclude the paper in Section 5. 2 KurdNet: State-of-the-Art In our previous work (Al</context>

More precisely, we aim at creating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of 5,000 essential concepts (i.e. synsets) that play a major role in the wordnets. Base Concepts (BC) is available on the Global WordNet Association (GWA)’s Web page2. The Entity-Relationship (ER) model for the data represented in Base Concept is shown in Figure 2. A sample synset is depicted in Figure 3. 2http://globalwordnet.org/ Figure 2: Base Concepts’ ER Model (Aliabadi et al., 2014) &lt;SYNSET&gt; &lt;ID&gt;ENG20-00008853-v&lt;/ID&gt; &lt;POS&gt;v&lt;/POS&gt; &lt;SYNONYM&gt; &lt;LITERAL&gt;shed&lt;SENSE&gt;4&lt;/SENSE&gt;&lt;/LITERAL&gt; &lt;LITERAL&gt;molt&lt;SENSE&gt;1&lt;/SENSE&gt;&lt;/LITERAL&gt; &lt;LITERAL&gt;exuviate&lt;SENSE&gt;1&lt;/SENSE&gt;&lt;/LITERAL&gt; &lt;LITERAL&gt;moult&lt;SENSE&gt;1&lt;/SENSE&gt;&lt;/LITERAL&gt; &lt;LITERAL&gt;slough&lt;SENSE&gt;1&lt;/SENSE&gt;&lt;/LITERAL&gt; &lt;/SYNONYM&gt; &lt;ILR&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;hypernym&lt;/TYPE&gt;ENG20-01471089-v&lt;/ILR&gt; &lt;ILR&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;eng_derivative&lt;/TYPE&gt;ENG20-01245451-n&lt;/ILR&gt; &lt;ILR&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;eng_derivative&lt;/TYPE&gt;ENG20-08844332-n&lt;/ILR&gt; &lt;ILR&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;eng_derivative&lt;/TYPE&gt;ENG20-12753095-n&lt;/ILR&gt; &lt;ILR&gt;&lt;TYPE&gt;eng_derivative&lt;/TYPE&gt;ENG20-12791455-n&lt;/ILR&gt; &lt;DEF&gt;cast off hair, skin, horn, or feathers&lt;/DEF&gt; &lt;USA</context>

Having compiled the translation lists, we combine them in two different ways: (i) a maximal alignment (abbr. max) which is a superset of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment (abbr. min) which is a subset of non-empty lists.

Each syntactic categories are organized to component files (Miller et al., 1993).

The linguistics features distinguishing these two dialects are phonological, lexical, and morphological.

Motivated by this success, many projects have been undertaken to build similar lexical databases for other languages. Among the large-scale projects are EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages. Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region spanning the intersections of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1). Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other resources, no wordnet has been built yet. Despite having a large number (20 to 30 millions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012; Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the only linguistic resource available on the Web is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010).

In the following, we first define the scope of our first prototype, then after justifying our choice of construction model, we describe KurdNet’s individual elements. 2.1 Scope Kurdish has two main dialects (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013): Sorani and Kurmanji. In the first prototype of KurdNet we focus only on the Sorani dialect. This is mainly due to lack of an available and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary. Moreover, processing Sorani is in general more challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a). 2.2 Methodology There are two well-known models for building wordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998): • Expand: in this model, the synsets are built in correspondence with the WordNet synsets and the semantic relations are directly imported. It has been used for Italian in MultiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet. • </context>

In the current version of KurdNet, for each synset we build a pool of sentences by fetching the first 5 sentences of each of its literals from the inverted list. These pools will later be assessed by lexicographers to filter out non-relevant instances. In future, more sophisticated approaches can be applied (e.g., exploiting contextual information). Definitions: due to lack of proper translation tools, this element was aligned manually. We built a graphical user interface to</context>

Its basic statistics are shown in Table 3 − the Renoos lemmatizer (Salavati et al., 2013): it is the result of a major revision of Jedar, a Kurdish stemmer whose outputs are stems. − the Pewan test collection (Esmaili et al., 2013b): is a test collection for both Sorani and Kurmanji. • Online Dictionaries: − Dictio: an English-to-Sorani dictionary with more than 13,000 headwords.

According to the Expand model, the aim is to build, whenever possible, Kurdish synsets which are synonymous (semantically correspondent) with the PWN synsets. The second strategy is based on Kurdishto-English translations. For each sense of a Kurdish word K, we look for a PWN synset S including at least one English translation of K and a link between K and S is established (Pianta et al., 2002). For the correct alignment of Sorani and Kurmanji synsets, we propose to use three complementary approaches: • use of English (here, Base Concepts) synsets as reference points between both dictionarytranslated synsets of Sorani and Kurmanji. 9http://ckb.wikipedia.org/ 10http://ku.wikipedia.org/ 11http://multiwordnet.fbk.eu/ English Sorani Kurmanji word1 S-translation1 K-translation1 word2 S-translation2 K-translation2 word3 K-translation3 word4 S-translation4 word5 Table 4: English-Sorani and English-Kurmanji dictionaries structure The results would be structured as shown in Table 4. • develo</context>

In this proposal, we highlight the shortcomings of the current prototype and put forward a detailed plan to transform this prototype to a full-fledged lexical database for the Kurdish language. 1 Introduction WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in numerous natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and information extraction with considerable success. Motivated by this success, many projects have been undertaken to build similar lexical databases for other languages. Among the large-scale projects are EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages. Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region spanning the intersections of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1). Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other resources, no wordnet has been built yet. Despite having a large number (20 to 30 millions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012; Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the only linguistic resource available on</context>

The most serious risk is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the lexical and conceptual structure of one of the languages involved, as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996). In our project, we follow the Expand model, since it can be partly automated and therefore would be faster. More precisely, we aim at creating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of 5,000 essential concepts (i.e. synsets) that play a major role in the wordnets.

In order to expand the usability of KurdNet, the following shortcomings must be overcome: 3.1 Incomplete Coverage of Kurdish Vocabulary KurdNet has been built as an alignment for Base Concepts and since Base Concepts contains only a small subset of English vocabulary, KurdNet’s coverage is inevitably small. Furthermore, as it can be seen in Table 1, due to the limitations of the dictionaries used, not all English words in the Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) have an equivalent in KurdNet. Hence the current mapping between WordNet and KurdNet is only partial. Finally, the lexical idiosyncrasies between Kurdish and English should be identified and included in KurdNet. 3.2 Refinement of Automatically-Generated Content Each synset must contain a comprehensive definition and a practical example.

According to (Vossen, 1996), the MultiWordNet (MWN11) model (Expand model) seems less complex and guarantees the highest degree of compatibility across different wordnets. The MWN model also has potential drawbacks. The most serious risk is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the lexical and conceptual structure of one of the languages involved, as (Vossen, 1996) points out. This risk can be considerably reduced by allowing the new wordnet to diverge, when necessary, from the PWN. Another important advantage of the MWN model is that automatic procedures can be devised to speed up both the construction of correspo</context>

In this proposal, we highlight the shortcomings of the current prototype and put forward a detailed plan to transform this prototype to a full-fledged lexical database for the Kurdish language. 1 Introduction WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in numerous natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and information extraction with considerable success. Motivated by this success, many projects have been undertaken to build similar lexical databases for other languages. Among the large-scale projects are EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages. Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region spanning the intersections of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1). Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other resources, no wordnet has been built yet. Despite having a large number (20 to 30 millions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012; Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the onl</context>

In the first prototype of KurdNet we focus only on the Sorani dialect. This is mainly due to lack of an available and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary. Moreover, processing Sorani is in general more challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a). 2.2 Methodology There are two well-known models for building wordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998): • Expand: in this model, the synsets are built in correspondence with the WordNet synsets and the semantic relations are directly imported. It has been used for Italian in MultiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet. • Merge: in this model, the synsets and relations are first built independently and then they are aligned with WordNet’s. It has been the dominant model in building BalkaNet and EuroWordNet. The expand model seems less complex and guarantees the highest degree of compatibility across different wordnets. But it also has potential drawbacks. The most serious risk is that of forcin</context>

Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other resources, no wordnet has been built yet. Despite having a large number (20 to 30 millions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012; Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages for which the only linguistic resource available on the Web is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010). In order to address this resource-scarceness problem, the Kurdish language processing project (KLPP1) has been recently launched at University of Kurdistan. Among the the major linguistic resources that KLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a 1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of Kurdish Speakers WordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish language.
