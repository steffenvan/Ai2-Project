Early recognition of distinguishing pat-
terns of a novel pandemic disease is im-
portant. We introduce a methodological
approach based on popular data mining
techniques to extract key features and
temporal patterns of swine (h1n1) flu that
is discriminated from swine flu like

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999956333333333">
Early recognition of a novel pandemic is desira-
ble to minimize its dissemination. However, it
usually spends some time in developing a diag-
nostic test and people tend to omit the test for
various reasons including cost, which leads to
late recognition. Under these circumstances,
symptoms and signs in clinical documents might
be valuable indicators to have a population pers-
pective on pandemic severity.
In this paper, we propose a methodological
approach to extract features of swine(h1n1) flu
distinctive to swine flu like patients’ one.

We randomly selected twenty clinical docu-

visited emergency room in Seoul National Uni-
versity Hospital (SNUH) with suspected case of
swine flu. Ten of the documents are RT-PCR test
positive cases, which mean that the patient is
swine flu infected patient, while the ten remain-
ing documents are RT-PCR negative cases. Each
document contains a patient’s symptoms, obser-
vations, recent clinical histories, clinical plans,
and diagnoses in natural language. The symp-

2.2 Hypotheses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974333333333">
We hypothesized two things as follows. 1) We
will be able to extract distinctive symptom set
between swine flu and swine-flu like patients by
adopting apriori association rule mining method.
2) Although the two target groups accompany
similar symptoms, we will be able to make se-
lected symptoms more discriminative by devel-
oping impact score and considering temporal
aspects, development rate.

2.3 Distinguishing Symptoms Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999723125">
We modeled each clinical document as one (tag,
item1, ..., itemn) transaction of which tag and
items indicate RT-PCR result and candidate fea-
tures, respectively. We set symptoms, signs, tra-
vel, and contact information as candidate fea-
tures. We divided target data into three groups
(Table 1) and ran apriori association rule algo-
rithm to produce rules associated with RT-
PCR(+) or RT-PCR(-) cases. Then the items ap-
peared in association rules are collected. The
items are grouped into four sets according to
their original rules and training data (Table 2).
The union of Ipos and Ipos_co was regarded as a
distinguishing feature set, If. To enhance discrim-
ination ability, we used some weights to score
them as shown in Table 2 and 3.

2.4 Disease Development Pattern Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875555555556">
We extracted temporal information of selected
features in sample documents and modeled as
interval constraints. We ran Floyd-Warshall’s
all-pairs-shortest path algorithm to get hidden
temporal relationships between two features. We
traced start time gaps of the features to compare
temporal patterns of the development rate of ex-
ternal indicators between two data sets, Data1
and Data2.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986205882353">
For input data, we produced transactions and ini-
tial temporal constraint network manually. We
extracted distinctive feature set, applied our scor-
ing method, and compared temporal aspects.
We limited support value threshold as 30% for
Ipos and Ineg and 0% for Ipos_co and Ineg_co
due to small data size. Eight signs and symptoms
as well as travel information were extracted from
47 items as distinguishing features of swine flu
(Table 3). Besides sputum, pharynx injection,
cvat, and travel information, five symptoms are
the ones contained in the latest Centers for Dis-
ease Control (CDC) H1N1 influenza case report
form. The others are strong indicators as well.
The previous version of the CDC form contains
sputum in the signs and symptoms section, and
Himmerick (2009) described that pharyngeal
injection is a clinical sign of uncomplicated
swine-origin influenza A. Travel information is
another important factor to diagnose an h1n1
case in Korea and included in a special purpose
h1n1 clinical document format in SNUH emer-
gency department.
We compared start time of the features but
could not find any differences. The symptoms
had been developed so rapidly that temporal pat-
tern comparison between two groups was not
meaningful. All the selected symptoms were de-
veloped within three days, and moreover, the
symptoms in twelve documents were occurred in
one day. As our data usually describes occur-
rence time in day granularity and the sample size
is too small, we could not compare the features
in finer granularity.

4 Conclusion and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988916666667">
In this paper, we tried to establish a methodolog-
ical approach to extract distinctive features of a
novel pandemic on the early symptoms expe-
rienced by the patients. We applied popular data
mining techniques to swine flu suspected cases.
The results correspond to outputs of previous
specialized medical domain research. We could
get valuable information with extremely small
amount of data. This methodological approach
could be used usefully in novel infectious disease
management and research to prevent spreading
of the pandemic at the very beginning stage.
