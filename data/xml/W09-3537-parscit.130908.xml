Although direct orthographic mapping has
been shown to outperform phoneme based
methods in English to Chinese (E2C) translit
eration, it is observed that phonological con
text plays an important role in resolving gra
phemic ambiguity. In this paper, we investi
gate the use of surface graphemic features to
approximate local phonological context for
E2C. In the absence of an explicit phonemic
representation of the English source names,
experiments show that the previous and next
character of a given English segment could ef
fectively capture the local context affecting its
expected pronunciation, and thus its rendition
in Chinese.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881944444445">
Proper names including personal names, place
names, and organization names, make up a con
siderable part of naturally occurring texts. Per
sonal names, in particular, do not only play an
important role in identifying an individual, but
also carry the family history, parental expecta
tion, as well as other information about a person.
In natural language processing, the proper rendi
tion of personal names, especially between dis
similar languages such as Chinese and English,
often contributes significantly to machine trans
lation accuracy and intelligibility, and cross
lingual information retrieval. This paper ad
dresses the problem of automatic English
Chinese forward transliteration (referred to as
E2C hereafter) of personal names.
Unlike many other languages, Chinese names
are characteristic in their relatively free choice
and combination of characters, particularly for
given names. Such apparent flexibility does not
only account for the virtually infinite number of
authentic Chinese names, but also leads to a con
siderable sample space when foreign names are
transliterated into Chinese. Underlying the large
sample space, however, is not entirely a random
distribution. On the one hand, there are no more
than a few hundred Chinese characters which are
used in names (e.g. Sproat et al., 1996). On the
other hand, beyond linguistic and phonetic prop
erties, many other social and cognitive factors
such as dialect, gender, domain, meaning, and
perception, are simultaneously influencing the
naming process and superimposing on the sur
face graphemic correspondence.
As the state of the art approach, direct ortho
graphic mapping (e.g. Li et al., 2004), making
use of graphemic correspondence between Eng
lish and Chinese directly, has been shown to out
perform phoneme based methods (e.g. Virga and
Khudanpur, 2003). In fact, transliteration of for
eign names into Chinese is often based on the
surface orthographic forms, as exemplified in the
transliteration of Beckham, where the supposedly
silent h in “ham” is taken as pronounced, result
ing in 汉姆 han4-mu3 in Mandarin Chinese and
咸 haam4 in Cantonese1.
However, as we have observed, there is con
siderable graphemic ambiguity in E2C, where an
English segment might correspond to different
Chinese segments. Such multiple mappings, to a
large extent, is associated with the phonological
context embedding the English segment, thus
affecting its expected pronunciation. Hence, if
such phonological context could be considered in

the transliteration model, some of the graphemic
ambiguity could be resolved. However, instead
of going for an explicit phonemic representation,
which might introduce an extra step for error
propagation, in the current study we investigate
the usefulness of surface graphemic features for
approximating the local phonological context in
E2C. Experiments show that the previous and
next character of a given segment could effec
tively capture the local phonological context and
improve transliteration accuracy.
A short note on terminology before we move
on: We use “segment” to refer to a minimal gra
phemic transliteration unit in the names. For
instance, in the data, the name Amyx is translit
erated as 阿米克斯 a1-mi3-ke4-si1, the graph
eme pairs are &lt;a, 阿&gt;, &lt;my, 米&gt;, and &lt;x, 克斯&gt;.
There are three English segments: “a”, “my” and
“x”; and three Chinese segments: 阿, 米 and 克
斯. A segment may or may not correspond to
exactly a syllable, although it often does.
In Section 2, we will briefly review some re
lated work. In Section 3, we will discuss some
observations on graphemic ambiguity in E2C.
The proposed method will be presented in Sec
tion 4. Experiments will be reported in Section 5,
with results discussed in Section 6, followed by a
conclusion in Section 7.

There are basically two categories of work on
machine transliteration. On the one hand, vari
ous alignment models are used for acquiring
transliteration lexicons from parallel corpora and
other resources (e.g. Lee et al., 2006; Jin et al.,
2008; Kuo and Li, 2008). On the other hand,
statistical transliteration models are built for
transliterating personal names and other proper
names, such as by means of noisy channel mod
els or direct models amongst others, phoneme
based (e.g. Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and
Khudanpur, 2003), or grapheme based (e.g. Li et
al., 2004), or a combination of them (Oh and
Choi, 2005), or based on phonetic (e.g. Tao et al.,
2006; Yoon et al., 2007) and semantic (e.g. Li et
al., 2007) features.
Li et al. (2004), for instance, used a Joint
Source Channel Model under the direct ortho
graphic mapping (DOM) framework, skipping
the middle phonemic representation in conven
tional phoneme based methods, and modelling
the segmentation and alignment preferences by
means of contextual n grams of the translitera
tion units. Their method was shown to outper
form phoneme based methods and those based
on the noisy channel model.
The n gram model used in Li et al. (2004) was
based on previous local context of grapheme
pairs. However, as we are going to show in Sec
tion 3, contexts on both sides of a segment are
important in determining the actual rendition of
it in Chinese. In addition, graphemic ambiguity
could in part be resolved by means of the phono
logical context embedding the segment. Hence
in the current study, we propose a method modi
fied from the Joint Source Channel Model to
take into account contexts on both sides of a
segment, and to approximate local phonological
context by means of surface graphemic features.

In this section, we will quantitatively analyse
some properties of E2C based on our data, and

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994471689655172">
The data used in the current study are based on
the English Chinese (EnCh) training and devel
opment data provided by the organisers of the
NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration Shared
Task. There are 31,961 English Chinese name
pairs in the training set, and 2,896 English
Chinese name pairs in the development set. The
data were manually cleaned up and aligned with
respect to the correspondence between English
and Chinese segments, e.g. Aa/l/to 阿/尔/托.
The analysis in this section is based on the train
ing set.
The Chinese transliterations in the data basi
cally correspond to Mandarin Chinese pronun
ciations of the English names, as used by media
in Mainland China (Xinhua News Agency, 1992).
Note that transliterations for English names
could differ considerably in Chinese, depending
on the dialect in question. Names transliterated
according to Mandarin Chinese pronunciations
are very different from those according to Can
tonese pronunciations, for instance. Translitera
tions used in Mainland China are also different
from those used in Taiwan region, despite both
are based on Mandarin Chinese. A well cited
example is a syllable initial /d/ may surface as in
Baghdad 巴格达 ba1-ge2-da2, but the syllable
final /d/ is not represented. This is true for trans
literation based on Mandarin Chinese pronuncia

tions. For Cantonese, however, it is different
since ending stops like –p, –t and –k are allowed
in Cantonese syllables. Hence the syllable final
/d/ in Baghdad is already captured in the last syl
lable of 巴格達 baa1-gaak3-daat6 in Cantonese.
Such phonological properties of Mandarin
Chinese might also account for the observation
that extra syllables are often introduced for cer
tain consonant segments in the middle of an Eng
lish name, as in Hamilton, transliterated as 汉密
尔顿 han4-mi4-er3-dun4 in Mandarin Chinese
(c.f. 咸美頓 haam4-mei5-deon6 in Cantonese);
and Beckham, transliterated as 贝克汉姆 bei4-
ke4-han4-mu3 in Mandarin Chinese (c.f. 碧咸
bik1-haam4 in Cantonese).

Table 1 quantitatively describes the training data.
On average each English name has around 3.14
segments, or transliteration units. On average
each English segment has around 1.7 different
renditions in Chinese. On the other hand, al
though the number of unique Chinese segments
is just a few hundred, on average one Chinese
segment could correspond to about 10 different
English segments. This suggests that English
Chinese graphemic segment correspondence
could be quite ambiguous. Further analysis is
therefore needed to see if any systematic patterns
could be found among such ambiguity.

found in the training data that n varies from 1 to
15, while 32.2% of the distinct English segments

shows the degree of graphemic ambiguity with
illustrative examples. Some of the ambiguity,
however, is the result of homophones. The effect
of homophones (whether or not tones are taken
into account) in E2C transliteration is worth
more in depth investigation, but it is beyond the
scope of the current study.

The other multiple correspondences are never
theless genuine ambiguity. The same English
graphemic segment, depending on its pronuncia
tion within the name, could be rendered in vari
ous Chinese segments of very different pronun
ciations. To determine the expected pronuncia
tion of the ambiguous English segment, however,
the phonological context embedding the segment
has an important role to play. For instance, the
graphemic segment “na”, when appearing at the
end of a name, is often pronounced as /na/ and
rendered as 娜 na4, especially for female names.
But when it is in the middle of a name, and espe
cially before “th”, it is often pronounced as /nei/
and rendered as 内 nei4. Similarly, the segment
“ty” is often pronounced as /ti/ at the end of a
name and transliterated as 蒂 di4. On the other
hand, if it is in the middle of a name, after an “s”
or in front of “le” or “re”, it is often pronounced
as /tai/ and therefore transliterated as 太 tai4.
Take another segment “le” as an example. It
is found to correspond to as many as 15 different
Chinese segments, including 利 li4, 勒 le4, 历 li4,
尔 er3, 莱 lai2, 里 li3, etc. When “le” appears at
the end of a name, all but a few cases are pro
nounced as /l/ and rendered as 尔 er3, particu
larly when it follows “a”, e.g. Dale 戴尔 dai4-
er3 and Dipasquale 迪帕斯奎尔 di2-pa4-si1-
kui2-er3. Exceptions are when “le” at the end of
a name follows “r”, where it is often rendered as
利 li4 instead. On the other hand, when “le” ap
pears at the beginning of a name where the
vowel is often prominently pronounced, it is usu
ally rendered as 勒 le4 or 莱 lai2, e.g. Lepke 莱
普克 lai2-pu3-ke4, except when it is followed by
the vowel “o”, where it is then often transliter
ated as 利 li4, e.g. Leonor 利奥诺 li4-ao4-nuo4.
When “le” appears in the middle of a name, the
transliteration is nevertheless more variable.
Still it is remarkable that “le” is transliterated as
历 li4 when it is followed by “c” or “x”, e.g.
Alex 阿历克斯 a4-li4-ke4-si1.
Such observations thus suggest two important
points for E2C. First, contexts on both sides of
a given segment do play a role in determining its
likely rendition in Chinese. Second, the phono
logical context is important for determining the
expected pronunciation of an English segment
given its position in a name. Hence we propose
a method, making use of contexts on both sides
of a segment, to approximate the local phono
logical context of a segment via surface gra
phemic features.

4 Proposed Metho
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998664">
The Joint Source Channel Model in Li et al.
(2004) making use of direct orthographic map
ping and a bigram language model for the seg
ment pairs (or token pairs in their terms) is as
follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9948516">
P(E , C) P(e1, e2,..., ek, c1, c2,..., ck)
P(&lt; e1, c1 &gt;, &lt; e2, c2 &gt;,..., &lt; ek, ck &gt;)
K
≈ ∏ P(&lt; ek, ck &gt;|&lt; ek −1, ck −1 &gt;
k=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991824137931">
where E refers to the English source name and C
refers to the transliterated Chinese name. With K
segments aligned between E and C, ek and ck re
fer to the kth English segment and its corre
sponding Chinese segment respectively.
While we have grounds for orthographic map
ping as mentioned in the introduction, there is
some modification we hope to make to the above
model. As pointed out in the last section, local
contexts on both sides of a given segment should
be important and useful for modelling the con
text embedding the segment, which in turn could
help determine its expected pronunciation. In
addition, the phonological environment might be
sufficiently represented by a neighbouring pho
neme instead of even a syllable. Thus we take
the last character from the previous segment and
the first character of the next segment (instead of
the whole neighbouring segment) into account,
irrespective of their corresponding Chinese seg
ments. This could be considered an attempt to
approximate the local phonological context of a
given segment by means of surface graphemic
features, even if we do not go for an explicit
phonemic representation of the source name.
Hence we propose to make use of bigrams in
both directions with equal weighting, and assign
a score, Score(E,C), to a transliteration candidate
as below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997343">
K
∏ P(&lt; ek, ck &gt; |lc(ek −1)) P(&lt; ek, ck &gt; |fc(ek + 1))

<bodyText confidence="0.999395833333333">
where lc(ek-1) refers to the last character of the
previous English segment, and fc(ek+1) refers to
the first character of the next English segment.
In the rest of this paper, we will refer to this
method as GAP, which stands for Graphemic

The 31,961 English Chinese name pairs from the
NEWS shared task training set were used for
training, and the 2,896 names in the development
set were used for testing. The data were first
manually cleaned up and aligned with respect to
the correspondence between English segments
and Chinese segments.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99932">
5.1 Segmentation of Test Names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926095238095">
Each test name was first segmented. All possible
segmentations were obtained based on the unique
English segments obtained from the manual
alignment above.
The graphemic units are made case insensitive.
When finding all possible graphemic segmenta
tions of the English source names, segments with
length 1 are only allowed if no longer segment
with that initial letter followed by a vowel is pos
sible. For example, while “a”, “k”, “l”, “o”, “v”,
“s” and “y” are all observed segments in the
training data, when computing the transliteration
for the test name Akalovsky, only two of the
possible segmentations, A/ka/lo/v/s/ky and
A/kal/o/v/s/ky, were considered while the rest
involving more single letter segments were ig
nored. This is justified by three reasons. First,
the more alternative segmentations, the more
alternative transliteration candidates are to be
evaluated. This is computationally expensive,
and many alternatives are in fact quite unlikely.
Second, single letter segments are redundant if a
longer segment is possible. On the one hand,
transliterations are usually based on a consonant
vowel combination as a unit. A consonant will
only be on its own as a segment if it occurs
among a consonant cluster, which has no direct
syllable correspondence in Chinese. For exam
ple, it is useless to single out the second “k” in
Akalovsky as the longer segment “ka” is pro
nounceable anyway, unlike in names with con
sonant clusters like Akst. On the other hand, in
the cases of doubling consonants like Ross, both
“s” and “ss” will correspond to similar sounds.
Third, the n gram models favour transliterations
with fewer segments anyway, so the segmenta
tions with more single letter segments will be
less probable in any case.
The possible segmentations obtained were
then ranked by a method similar to GAP. The
score for each segmentation candidate S,
Score(S), is computed by:

<equation confidence="0.998423">

∏ P(sk  |lc(sk −1)) P(sk  |fc(sk + 1))

where sk is the kth segment in a name, lc(sk�1) is
the last character of the previous segment and

above the threshold, all pairs below the threshold
would be considered. All combinations obtained
were then subject to ranking by the GAP translit

The transliteration candidates were evaluated and

also run the Joint Source Channel Model (JSCM)
described in Li et al. (2004) on the test data. In
addition, we also tested a variation of GAP,
called GAP s, where the neighbouring characters
are replaced by the neighbouring segments in the
computation of the scores, that is, lc(ek�1) is re
place by &lt;ek�1,ck�1&gt; and fc(ek+1) is replaced by
&lt;ek+1,ck+1&gt;. Note that similar changes were ap
plied to the ranking of the source name segmen
tations for both methods accordingly.
System performance was measured by the
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (Kantor and
Voorhees, 2000), as well as the Word Accuracy
in Top 1 (ACC) and Fuzziness in Top 1 (Mean

As seen in Table 3, although the top 1 seg
mentation candidate could already achieve a cer
tain performance level, taking the top 3 segmen
tation candidates could nevertheless considerably
improve the MRR. This apparently suggests that
the source name segmentation step could have
significantly affected the overall performance of
transliteration. Taking more segmentation can
didates into account could help raise some cor
rect transliterations to a higher rank, but there
was not much improvement in terms of the accu
racy at the top 1 position.
In terms of the grapheme pair frequency, set
ting the threshold at 3 gave only slightly better
results than setting it at 5. A possible reason is
that about 70% of all unique grapheme pairs
have frequency below 5, and out of these over
47% only have single correspondence. In other
words, there are a lot of grapheme pairs of low
frequency, and for those ambiguous English seg
ments, the distribution of their corresponding
Chinese segments could be relatively uneven.
Hence the following comparison between
various transliteration methods was based on the
combination of N=3 and f ≥ 3.

As evident from Table 4, system GAP s out
performed JSCM. The accuracy at top 1 position
is much improved, thus boosting the MRR too.
This improvement therefore supports our hy
pothesis that contexts on both sides of a given
segment are important for determining its rendi
tion in Chinese, where part of the graphemic am
biguity could be successfully resolved. Mean
while, system GAP further improves the results
from GAP s, bringing ACC up to 0.6450 and
MRR to 0.7319. This shows that the phonologi
cal context could be better captured, though only
approximately, by means of the last character of
the previous segment and the first character of
the next segment, instead of the whole
neighbouring segments. This is because the
phonological context is often most closely re
lated to the neighbouring phonemes instead of a
whole syllable.

The name Abercromby, according to the gold
standard, should be transliterated as PuTNAArL
a4-bo2-ke4-long2-bi3. This transliteration came
third in the JSCM system, whose top first and
second candidates were PJMAV L a4-bo2-
ke4-luo2-mu3-bi3 and PJJF,//FAV L a4-bei4-
er3-ke4-luo2-mu3-bi3 respectively. On the con
trary, the expected transliteration came first in
the GAP system.
The top 3 source name segmentation candi
dates for both methods are shown in Table 5.
The expected segmentation has already been
identified as the best candidate in GAP, while it
came third in JSCM.

When it comes to the evaluation of the trans
literation candidates, the longer candidates could
even score higher than the expected outcome in
JSCM. The statistical data show that the bigram
c/A+ro/�V is far more likely than c/A+rom/A,
but P(&lt;ek,ck&gt;=&lt;rom,A&gt;  |fc(ek+1)=b) is much
stronger than P(&lt;ek,ck&gt;=&lt;m, &gt;  |fc(ek+1)=b).
Hence, taking the character on both sides of a
segment, GAP managed to rank PuTNAA�L
highest.
Another example is the name Regelson, which
is transliterated as ffi_4i: li3-ge2-er3-sen1 in
the gold standard. The expected transliteration is

higher than P(&lt;ek,ck&gt;=&lt;ge,4&gt;  |&lt;ek-1,ck-1&gt;=&lt;re,

Hence the expected transliteration is ranked

6.4 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996325">
As the proposed method stands, errors could
have been propagated from two steps. The first
is the source name segmentation step. If it hap
pens that the top segmentation candidates are
already wrong to start with, there is no way to
reach the expected transliteration at all. Hence it
is even more important to maintain a high accu
racy for the segmentation step. The other error
propagation step is certainly when transliteration
candidates are evaluated. The results for this
step often heavily rely on the training data. If it
happens that the grapheme pair distributions are
somewhat skewed, particular Chinese segments
would be preferred irrespective of relevant lin
guistic or other factors. On the other hand, if
many homophones are used for a particular Eng
lish segment, the chance of reaching the expected
transliteration with one of the homophones is
again loosened. More on this will be discussed
in the next section.
For the latter error propagation step, our at
tempt to make use of contexts on both sides of a
segment has been shown to be able to improve
the results. To see how much of the errors is at
tributable to the segmentation step, we roughly
made an estimation by comparing the length of
the top 1 candidates given in JSCM and GAP
with the gold standard. It was found that 17.8%
and 14.2% of the first candidates in JSCM and
GAP respectively do not match the length of the
gold standard. More detailed analysis of the
segmentation results is in progress.

6.5 Current Limitations and Future Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984353846154">
Our current treatment of neighbouring context
and graphemic approximation of phonological
context is shown to outperform pure DOM based
on previous context only. Nevertheless, there are
several directions of work which would require
more investigation to further improve E2C per
formance.
First, the source name segmentation step needs
further improvement to minimise error propaga
tion from an early step. Phonological knowledge
is obviously important in this regard as how a
given English name should be segmented and
pronounced is determined by its phonological
context. Even without an explicit phonemic rep
resentation of the source names, more could be
done in terms of modelling the phonological con
text via the surface graphemes.
Second, relating to the above, foreign names
of different origins often have very different
phonological properties leading to different pro
nunciations for the same orthographic forms.
The silent h in Beckham mentioned earlier is one
example, even though Chinese transliterations
are often based on surface orthographic proper
ties. Other problematic cases could be from lan
guages like Russian and German where there are
relatively more consonant clusters. For instance,
the segment “scho” is often transliterated as one
syllable (e.g. f shao4, A xiao4, or * she4) but
the segment “stro” often leads to three syllables
(e.g. WEVV si1-te4-luo2). It is therefore impor
tant to incorporate more phonological knowledge
into the transliteration model, not only to gener
ate more reliable and acceptable transliteration
candidates, but also to reduce effort in evaluating
phonologically invalid segmentation candidates
and syllable structures, thus making the task
computationally less expensive.
Third, as one of our separate ongoing studies
shows, homophones are not only abundant in
Chinese language per se, but also in E2C trans
literation. The situation is particularly salient in
Chinese transliterations based on Cantonese pro
nunciations. For example, while some names
might have two transliterations with different
pronunciations, like Jackson as 積遜 zik1-seon3
or 積臣 zik1-san4, the same name might also be
rendered in two forms with a different character
having the same pronunciation, such as Adam as
亞當 or 阿當 (both pronounced as aa3-dong1 in
Cantonese). Two transliterations for the same
name might have the same sound but different
tones, e.g. Ashley as 艾殊利 aai6-syu4-lei6 or 艾
舒利 aai6-syu1-lei6. We therefore attempt to
model the English Chinese segment correspon
dence via an intermediate representation of the
phonetic transcription of the Chinese characters.
Preliminary results are reported in Kwong (2009).
Although it happens that only one transliteration
is given for each name in the gold standard data
used in this study, the variability of E2C in real
ity is evident. It is therefore important for sys
tems to be able to accommodate acceptable
transliteration alternatives, particularly for trans
literation extraction and information retrieval.

Fourth, given that tonal patterns could help
distinguish some homophone ambiguity, the ef
fect of the tonal factor and its potential associa

names is worth further investigation.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954">
Hence in this paper, we have reported our work
on approximating phonological context for E2C
with surface graphemic features. This is based
on the observation that certain graphemic ambi
guity is closely associated with the local contexts
on both sides of a given segment, the phonologi
cal properties of which often determine its ex
pected pronunciation. Experiments have shown
that in the absence of an explicit phonemic repre
sentation of the English source names, the previ
ous and next character of a given segment could
be effectively employed to approximate the local
phonological context affecting the rendition of a
given segment in Chinese. Our proposed method
GAP gives better results than the conventional
JSCM which only makes use of previous context,
and GAP s which considers the whole
neighbouring segments. Future work includes
improving the source name segmentation step to
minimise error propagation from an early stage,
incorporating other factors like name origin and
special phonological properties of different
source languages into the transliteration model,
as well as effectively handling homophones and
tonal patterns in E2C transliteration.

On the other hand, statistical transliteration models are built for transliterating personal names and other proper names, such as by means of noisy channel mod els or direct models amongst others, phoneme based (e.g. Knight and Graehl, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003), or grapheme based (e.g. Li et al., 2004), or a combination of them (Oh and Choi, 2005), or based on phonetic (e.g. Tao et al., 2006; Yoon et al., 2007) and semantic (e.g. Li et al., 2007) features. Li et al. (2004), for instance, used a Joint Source Channel Model under the direct ortho graphic mapping (DOM) framework, skipping the middle phonemic representation in conven tional phoneme based methods, and modelling the segmentation and alignment preferences by means of contextual n grams of the translitera tion units. Their method was shown to outper form phoneme based methods and those based on the noisy channel model. The n gram mo</context>

Such observations thus suggest two important points for E2C. First, contexts on both sides of a given segment do play a role in determining its likely rendition in Chinese. Second, the phono logical context is important for determining the expected pronunciation of an English segment given its position in a name. Hence we propose a method, making use of contexts on both sides of a segment, to approximate the local phono logical context of a segment via surface gra phemic features. 4 Proposed Metho The Joint Source Channel Model in Li et al. (2004) making use of direct orthographic map ping and a bigram language model for the seg ment pairs (or token pairs in their terms) is as follows: P(E , C) P(e1, e2,..., ek, c1, c2,..., ck) P(&lt; e1, c1 &gt;, &lt; e2, c2 &gt;,..., &lt; ek, ck &gt;) K ≈ ∏ P(&lt; ek, ck &gt;|&lt; ek −1, ck −1 &gt; k=1 where E refers to the English source name and C refers to the transliterated Chinese name. With K segments aligned between E and C, ek and ck re fer to the kth English segment and its corre sponding Chinese segment respectively. While we have grounds for orthographic map ping as mentioned in the introduction, there is some modifica</context>

(2004)" startWordPosition="3089" endWordPosition="3092">he top N segmentation candidates, the transliteration candidates were generated by looking up the grapheme pairs obtained from manual alignment with frequency over a certain threshold f. We tested with f &gt; 3 and f &gt; 5. If there is no grapheme pair for a certain segment above the threshold, all pairs below the threshold would be considered. All combinations obtained were then subject to ranking by the GAP translit eration method. 5.3 Testing The transliteration candidates were evaluated and ranked by the GAP method. For comparison, we also run the Joint Source Channel Model (JSCM) described in Li et al. (2004) on the test data. In addition, we also tested a variation of GAP, called GAP s, where the neighbouring characters are replaced by the neighbouring segments in the computation of the scores, that is, lc(ek�1) is re place by &lt;ek�1,ck�1&gt; and fc(ek+1) is replaced by &lt;ek+1,ck+1&gt;. Note that similar changes were ap plied to the ranking of the source name segmen tations for both methods accordingly. System performance was measured by the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (Kantor and Voorhees, 2000), as well as the Word Accuracy in Top 1 (ACC) and Fuzziness in Top 1 (Mean F score) used in the NEWS shared tas</context>

Unlike many other languages, Chinese names are characteristic in their relatively free choice and combination of characters, particularly for given names. Such apparent flexibility does not only account for the virtually infinite number of authentic Chinese names, but also leads to a con siderable sample space when foreign names are transliterated into Chinese. Underlying the large sample space, however, is not entirely a random distribution. On the one hand, there are no more than a few hundred Chinese characters which are used in names (e.g. Sproat et al., 1996). On the other hand, beyond linguistic and phonetic prop erties, many other social and cognitive factors such as dialect, gender, domain, meaning, and perception, are simultaneously influencing the naming process and superimposing on the sur face graphemic correspondence. As the state of the art approach, direct ortho graphic mapping (e.g. Li et al., 2004), making use of graphemic correspondence between Eng lish and Chinese directly, has been shown to out perform phoneme based methods (e.g. Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).

There are 31,961 English Chinese name pairs in the training set, and 2,896 English Chinese name pairs in the development set. The data were manually cleaned up and aligned with respect to the correspondence between English and Chinese segments, e.g. Aa/l/to 阿/尔/托. The analysis in this section is based on the train ing set. The Chinese transliterations in the data basi cally correspond to Mandarin Chinese pronun ciations of the English names, as used by media in Mainland China (Xinhua News Agency, 1992). Note that transliterations for English names could differ considerably in Chinese, depending on the dialect in question. Names transliterated according to Mandarin Chinese pronunciations are very different from those according to Can tonese pronunciations, for instance. Translitera tions used in Mainland China are also different from those used in Taiwan region, despite both are based on Mandarin Chinese.
