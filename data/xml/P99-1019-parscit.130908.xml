Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999967696969697">
Syntactic realization grammars have tradi-
tionally attempted to accept inputs with the
highest possible level of abstraction, in or-
der to facilitate the work of the compo-
nents (sentence planner) preparing the in-
put. Recently, the search for higher ab-
straction has been, however, challenged (El-
hadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Ram-
bow, 1997)(Busemann and Horacek, 1998).
In this paper, we contribute to the issue of
selecting the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; abstraction level in the
input to syntactic realization grammar by
considering the case of partitives and pos-
sessives in a bilingual Hebrew-English gen-
eration grammar. In the case of bilingual
generation, the ultimate goal is to provide a
single input structure, where only the open-
class lexical entries are specific to the lan-
guage. In that case, the minimal abstraction
required must cover the different syntactic
constraints of the two languages.
We present a contrastive analysis of the
syntactic realizations of possessives and par-
titives in Hebrew and English and conclude
by presenting an input specification for com-
plex NPs which is slightly more abstract
than the one used in SURGE. We define two
main features — possessor and ref-set and
discuss how the grammar handles complex
syntactic co-occurrence phenomena based on
this input. We conclude by evaluating how
the resulting input specification language is
appropriate for both languages.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988875">
One of the first issues to address when se-
lecting a syntactic realization component
is whether its input specification language
fits the desired application. Traditionally,
syntactic realization components have at-
tempted to raise the abstraction level of in-
put specifications for two reasons: (1) to pre-
serve the possibility of paraphrasing and (2)
to make it easy for the sentence planner to
map from semantic data to syntactic input
As new applications appear, that can-
not start generation from a semantic in-
put because such an input is not available
(for example re-generation of sentences from
syntactic fragments to produce summaries
(Barzilay et al., 1999) or generation of com-
plex NPs in a hybrid template system for
business letters (Gedalia, 1996)), this moti-
vation has lost some of its strength. Con-
sequently, &amp;quot;shallow surface generators&amp;quot; have
recently appeared (Lavoie and Rambow,
1997) (Busemann and Horacek, 1998) that
require an input considerably less abstract
than those required by more traditional re-
alization components such as SURGE (El-
hadad and Robin, 1996) or KPML (Bate-
man, 1997).
In this paper, we contribute to the de-
bate on selecting an appropriate level of ab-
straction by considering the case of bilin-
gual generation. We present results ob-
tained while developing the HUGG syntactic
realization component for Hebrew (Dahan-
Netzer, 1997). One of the goals of this sys-
tem is to design a generator with an input
specification language as similar as possible
to that of an English generator, SURGE in
our case.
The ideal scenario for bilingual generation
is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of the

following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9994022">
1. Prepare an input specification in one
language
2. Translate all the lexical entries (func-
tion words do not appear)
3. Generate with any grammar
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997940526315789">
In the example, the same input structure
is used and the generator can produce sen-
tences in both languages if only the lexical
items are translated.
Consider the following paraphrase in En-
glish for the same input: John gave Mary a
book.
The Hebrew grammar does not produce
such a paraphrase, as there is no equivalent
in Hebrew to the dative move alternation.
In this case, we conclude that the input ab-
straction level is appropriate. In contrast,
if the input had specified a structure such as
indirect-object(prep=to/le, np=Mary), then
it would not have been abstract enough to
serve as a bilingual input structure.
Similarly, the English possessive marker is
very close to the Hebrew &amp;quot;construct state&amp;quot;
(smixut):

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.813374222222222">
The following input structure seems,
therefore, appropriate for both languages:
cat common
lex &amp;quot;palace&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;armon&amp;quot;
possessor [lex &amp;quot;king&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;melex&amp;quot;
definite yes
There are, however, divergences between
the use of smixut in Hebrew and of the pos-
sessive marker in English:

? The house&apos;s windows The windows of the house
Halonot ha-bayit ha-Halonot Set ha-bayit
Our goal, therefore, is to design an input
structure that is abstract enough to let the
grammar decide whether to use a possessive
marker vs. an of-construct in English or a
Sel-construct vs. a smixut-construction in
Hebrew.
A similar approach has been adopted in
generation (Bateman, 1997), (Bateman et
al., 1991) and in machine translation most
notably in (Dorr, 1994). Dorr focuses on di-
vergences at the clause level as illustrated by
the following example:
I like Mary
Maria me gusta a mi
Mary pleases me
Dorr selects a representation structure
based on Jackendoff&apos;s Lexical Conceptual
Structures (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1990).
In the KPML system, the proposed so-
lution is based on the systemic notion of
&amp;quot;delicacy&amp;quot; and the assumption is that low-
delicacy input features (the most abstract
ones) remain common to the two target lan-
guages and high-delicacy features would dif-
fer.
In this paper, we focus on the input spec-
ification for complex NPs. The main reason
for this choice is that the input for NPs in
SURGE has remained close to English syn-
tax (low abstraction). It consists of the fol-
lowing main sub-constituents: head, classi-
fier, describer, qualifier and determiner.
In previous work (Elhadad, 1996), we dis-
cuss how to map a more abstract domain-
specific representation to the SURGE input

structure within a sentence planner. When
moving to a bilingual generator, we have
found the need for a higher level of ab-
straction to avoid encoding language-specific
knowledge in the sentence planners. We
specifically discuss here the following deci-
sions:

In the rest of the paper, we first present
basic contrastive data and existing analyses
about possessives and partitives in Hebrew
and English. We then present the input fea-
tures we have designed to cover possessives
and partitives in both languages and discuss
how these features are used to account for
the main decisions required of the realizer.
We conclude by an evaluation of the bilin-
gual input structure on a set of 100 sample
input structures for complex NPs in the two
languages and of the divergences that remain
in the generated NPs. In conclusion, this
bilingual analysis has helped us identify im-
portant abstractions that lead to more fluent
generation in both languages.

2 Possessives and Partitives in
Hebrew and English
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916166666667">
This section briefly presents data on posses-
sives and partitives in English and Hebrew.
These observations delimit the questions we
address in the paper: when is a genitive con-
struct used to express possessives and when
is an explicit partitive used.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982415">
2.1 Possessives in English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9885157">
Possessives can be realized in two basic
structures: as part of the determiner se-
quence (Halliday, 1994) (as either a pos-
sessive pronoun or a full NP marked with
apostrophe-s as a genitive marker) or as a
construct NP of NP.
In addition to possessive, the genitive
marker can realize several semantic relations
(Quirk et al., 1985) (pp.192-203): subjec-
tive genitive (the boy&apos;s application — the boy
applied) , genitive of origin (the girl&apos;s story
— the girl told a story), objective genitive,
descriptive genitive (a women&apos;s college — a
college for woman).
As a consequence of this versatility, the
general decision of apostrophe vs. of is
not trivial: Quirk claims that the higher
on the gender scale, i.e., the more animate
the noun, the more the possessor realization
tends to be realized as an inflected genitive:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999806875">
• Person&apos;s name: Segovia&apos;s pupil
• Person&apos;s nouns: the boy&apos;s new shirt
• Collective nouns: the nation&apos;s social se-
curity
• Higher Animals: the horse&apos;s neck
• Geographical names: Europe&apos;s future
• Locative nouns: the school&apos;s history
• Temporal nouns: the decade&apos;s event
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995798875">
This decision also interacts with other re-
alization decisions: if several modifiers must
be attached to the same head, they can com-
pete for the same slot in the syntactic struc-
ture. In such cases, the decision is one of
preference ranking: The boy&apos;s application of
last year vs. last year&apos;s application of the
boy.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992449">
2.2 Possessives in Hebrew
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999266875">
Possessives in Hebrew can be realized by
three syntactic constructions:
The construct state (called smixut) is
similar to the apostrophe marker in En-
glish: it involves a noun adjacent to an-
other noun or noun phrase, without any
marker (like a preposition) between them
(Berman, 1978). The head noun in the con-
struct form generally undergoes morpholog-
ical changes: yaldah - yaldat. Smixut is, on
the one hand, very productive in Hebrew and
yet very constrained (Dahan-Netzer and El-
hadad, 1998b).
construct state free genitive double genitive

</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.950958">
146
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.85012156">
Free genitive constructs use a preposi-
tional phrase with the preposition Sel. Many
studies treat Sel as a case marker only
(cf. (Berman, 1978) (Yzhar, 1993) (Borer,
1988)).
The choice of one of the three forms seems
to be stylistic and vary in spoken and writ-
ten Hebrew (cf. (Berman, 1978), (Glin-
ert, 1989), (Oman, 1964), and discussion
in (Seikevicz, 1979)). But, in addition to
these pragmatic factors and as is the case for
the English genitive, the construct state can
realize a wide variety of semantic relations
(Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), (Azar,
1985), (Levi, 1976). The selection is also
a matter of preference ranking among com-
petitors for the same syntactic slot. For ex-
ample, we have shown in (Dahan-Netzer and
Elhadad, 1998b) that the semantic relations
that can be realized by a construct state
are the ones defined as classifier in SURGE.
Therefore, the co-occurrence of such a rela-
tion with another classifier leads to a com-
petition for the syntactic slot of &amp;quot;classifier&amp;quot;
and also contributes to the decision of how
to realize a possessive.
Consider the following example:
••■
common
lex &amp;quot;Simlah&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;dress&amp;quot;
lex &amp;quot;Sabat&amp;quot;
cat common
lex &amp;quot;yalda&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;girl&amp;quot;
If only the possessor is provided in the fol-
lowing input, it can be mapped to a con-
struct state:
Simlat ha-yaldah
dress-cs the-girl
the girl&apos;s dress
If a classifier is provided in addition,
the construct-state slot is not available
anymore&apos;, and the free genitive construct
must be used:
Simlat ha-Sabat Set ha-yaldah
dress-cs the-Shabat of the-girl
The Shabat dress of the girl
&apos;If the classifier had been specified in the input
as a semantic relation as discussed in (Dahan-Netzer
and Elhadad, 1998b), an alternative realization ( The
girl&apos;s dress for Shabat) could have been obtained.

2.3 Partitives in English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989003688888889">
The partitive relation denotes a subset of the
thing to which the head of a noun phrase
refers. A partitive relation can be realized in
two main ways: as part of the pre-determiner
sequence (Halliday, 1994), (Winograd, 1983)
using quantifiers that have a partitive mean-
ing (e.g., some/most/many/one-third (of
the) children) or using a construction of the
form a measure/X of Y.
There are three subtypes of the parti-
tive construction ((Quirk et al., 1985)[p.130],
(Halliday, 1994)): measure a mile of cable,
typical partitives a loaf of bread, a slice of
cake, and general partitives: a piece/bit/of
an item of X.
In the syntactic structure of a partitive
structure, the part is the head of the phrase
(and determines agreement), but the Thing
- is what is being measured. This creates
an interesting difference between the logical
and syntactic structure of the NP.
(Mercuk and Perstov, 1987) defines the
elective surface syntactic relation which con-
nects an of-phrase to superlative adjectives
or numerals. An elective phrase is an ellip-
tical structure: the rightmost [string] of the
strings. It can be headed by an adjective in
superlative form (the poorest among the na-
tion), a numeral (45 of these 256 sentences),
ordinal (the second of three) or a quantita-
tive word having the feature elect: all, most,
some of.. The elective relation can be used
recursively (Many of the longest of the first
45 of these 256 sentences).
In the case of quantifier-partitives, one
must decide whether to use an explicitly par-
titive construct (some of the children) or not
(some children). The structure that does
not use of is used for generic NPs (when
the head is non-definite: most children). For
specific reference, the of-construction is op-
tional with nouns and obligatory with pro-
nouns:
all (of) the meat
all of it

There are two possible ways to express par-
titivity in Hebrew: using a construction of

the form X me- Y, or using a partitive quan-
tifier. In contrast to English, quantifiers that
are marked as partitive, cannot be used in an
explicitly partitive structure:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.2394624">
rov ha-yeladym — * rov me-ha-yeladym — most of the
children
Se &apos;or ha-yeladym — * Se &apos;or me-ha-yeladym — the rest of the
children
col ha-yeladym — * col me-ha-yeladym — all of the children
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.860608333333333">
Conversely, a quantifier that is not marked
as partitive can be used in an explicitly par-
titive structure:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.97869925">

harbeh me-hayeladym — many of the children
mewat ha-yeladym — few the-children
mewat me-ha-yeladym — few of the-children
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.998622222222222">
There are complex restrictions in Hebrew on
the co-occurrence of several determiners in
the same NP and on their relative order-
ing within the NP. To explain them, Glin-
ert (Glinert, 1989) adopts a functional per-
spective, quite appropriate to the needs of
a generation system, and identifies a general
pattern for the NP, that we use as a basis for
the mapping rules in HUGG:
[partitive determiner amount head
classifiers describers
post-det/quant qualifiers]
Yzhar and Doron (Doron, 1991) (Yzhar,
1993) distinguish between two sets of deter-
miners, that they call D and Q quantifiers.
The distinction is based on syntactic fea-
tures, such as position, ability to be modi-
fied, ability to participate in partitive struc-
tures and requirement to agree in number
and gender with the head. This distinction
is used to explain co-occurrence restrictions,
the order of appearance of D vs Q quantifiers
and the recursive structure of D determiners:
D determiners can be layered on top of other
D determiners. A single Q quantifier can oc-
cur in an NP and it remains attached closest
to the head.
In (Dahan-Netzer, 1997) and (Dahan-
Netzer and Elhadad, 1998a), we have refined
the D/Q classification and preferred using
functional criteria: we map the Q quanti-
fiers to the &amp;quot;amount&amp;quot; category defined by
Glinert, and the D set is split into the parti-
tive and determiner categories — each with a
different function. Of these, only partitives
are recursive.
Given these observations, the following de-
cisions must be left &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; in the input to
the realizer: how to map a possessor to dif-
ferent realizations; in which order to place
co-occurring quantifiers; and whether to use
an explicit of construct for partitive quanti-
fiers. The input specification language must
also enforce that only acceptable recursive
structures be expressible.

3.1 Input Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981145333333333">
The input structure for NPs we adopt is split
in four groups of features, which appear in
Figure 3.1:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99863175">
• Head or reference-set: defines the thing

thing
• Identifying: identifies the thing among

• Quantifying: determines the quantity or

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99066935">
The main modifications from the existing
SURGE input structure are the introduction
of the ref-set feature and the update of the
usage of the possessor feature.
For both of these features, the main re-
quirement on the realizer is to properly han-
dle cases of &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot; for the same re-
stricted syntactic slot, as illustrated in the
Shabat dress .example above.
The possible realizations of pos-
sessor are controlled by the feature
realize-possessor-as free-genitive,
bound or double-genitive. Defaults
(unmarked cases) vary between the two
languages and the co-occurrence constraints
also vary, because each form is mapped to
different syntactic slots.
For example, a bound possessor is mapped
to the determiner slot in English, while in
Hebrew it is mapped to a classifier slot.

When possessives are realized as free gen-
itives, they are mapped to the slot of qual-
ifiers, usually in the front position. Boro-
chovsky (Borochovsky, 1986) discusses ex-
ceptions to this ordering rule in Hebrew:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.569155">

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.920345739130435">
The commission for-appeals of the-police
* Vawadah Sel ha-MiSTarah l-wirwurym
In this example, the purpose-modifier is
&amp;quot;closer&amp;quot; semantically to the head than the
possessor. The ordering decision must rely
on semantic information (purpose) that is
not available in our general input structure
(cf. (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b) for
an even more abstract proposal).
Realization rules in each language take
into account the restrictions on possible
mappings for the possessor by unifying the
feature realize-possessive-as based on
the lexical properties of both the head and
the possessor:
Construct-state not ok for possessive rela-
tion with proper name:
? Simlat Hanah - ? dress-cs Hanah
Double possessive ok for person names and
possessor:
Simlatah Sel Hanah - dress-cs-her of Hanah
Double possessive not ok for non-possessive
relation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5256005">
* Simlatah Sel ha-Sabat
* dress-cs-her of the-Shabat
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995280944444444">
Similarly, the possible realizations of the
partitive are controlled by the feature
realize-partitive-as: of or quantifier.
Quantifiers are classified along the por-
tion/amount dimension. This system can
be realized either lexically by quantifiers
marked as partitive, or by using an explicit
partitive syntactic structure X me- Y/X of
Y.
Because the realization grammar uses the
knowledge of which word realizes which func-
tion, the distinction among partitive quan-
tifiers, amount quantifiers and determiners
predicts the order of the words in the He-
brew NP. The standard order is:
[partitive determiner amount head]
As noted above, only partitives can en-
ter into recursive structures, in both Hebrew
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997929">
149
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.950952104166666">
and English. Accordingly, our input specifi-
cation language enforces the constraint that
only a single amount and a single identifica-
tion feature can be present simultaneously.
Whenever a partitive quantifier is desired,
the input specification must include a ref-set
feature instead of the head. This enforces
the constraint that partitives yield recursive
constructs, similarly to Mel&apos;cuk&apos;s elective-
relation. Such recursive structures are illus-
trated in the following example:
wasarah me-col ha-mafgynym
ten of-all the-demonstrators
Ten of all of the demonstrators
cat np value 10 i &amp;quot;mafgyn&amp;quot;
cardinal total -I- [ lex yes
[ ref-set ref-set definite
t
The input is abstract enough to let the re-
alization grammar decide whether to build
an explicitly partitive construction. This de-
cision depends on the lexical features of the
realizing quantifiers and is different in En-
glish and Hebrew, as discussed above.
Additional realization rules take into ac-
count additional co-occurrence restrictions.
For example, in Hebrew, if the &amp;quot;portion&amp;quot;
part is modified with adjectives, then an ex-
plicitly partitive construction must be used:
ha-rov ha-gadol mi-beyn ha-yeladym
the-most the-big of-from the-children
The vast majority of the children
In summary, we have presented a set of
input features for complex NPs that include
the abstract possessor and ref-set features.
These two features can be mapped to dif-
ferent syntactic slots. Realization rules in
the grammar control the mapping of these
features based on complex co-occurrence re-
strictions. They also take into account the
lexical properties of specific quantifiers and
determiners when deciding whether to use
explicitly partitive constructions. Finally,
the input structure enforces that only parti-
tive relations can enter into recursive struc-
tures. Both HUGG in Hebrew and SURGE
in English have been adapted to support this
modified input specification.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989208333333">
To evaluate whether the proposed input
structure is appropriate as a bilingual spec-
ification, we have tested our generation sys-
tem on a set of 100 sample inputs for com-
plex NPs in English and Hebrew. In the
experiment, we only translated open-class
lexical items, thus following the &amp;quot;ideal sce-
nario&amp;quot; discussed in the Introduction. De-
spite the divergences between their surface
syntactic structure, the input structures pro-
duced valid complex NPs in both languages
in all cases.
We identified the following open problems
in the resulting sample: the selection of the
unmarked realization option and the deter-
mination of the default value of the definite
feature remain difficult and vary a lot be-
tween the two languages.
This case study has demonstrated that the
methodology of contrastive analysis of simi-
lar semantic relations in two languages with
dissimilar syntactic realizations is a fruitful
way to define a well-founded input specifica-
tion language for syntactic realization.

<abstract confidence="0.999228205882353">Syntactic realization grammars have traditionally attempted to accept inputs with the highest possible level of abstraction, in order to facilitate the work of the components (sentence planner) preparing the input. Recently, the search for higher abstraction has been, however, challenged (Elhadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Rambow, 1997)(Busemann and Horacek, 1998). In this paper, we contribute to the issue of selecting the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; abstraction level in the input to syntactic realization grammar by considering the case of partitives and possessives in a bilingual Hebrew-English generation grammar. In the case of bilingual generation, the ultimate goal is to provide a single input structure, where only the openclass lexical entries are specific to the language. In that case, the minimal abstraction required must cover the different syntactic constraints of the two languages. We present a contrastive analysis of the syntactic realizations of possessives and partitives in Hebrew and English and conclude by presenting an input specification for complex NPs which is slightly more abstract than the one used in SURGE. We define two features — discuss how the grammar handles complex syntactic co-occurrence phenomena based on this input. We conclude by evaluating how the resulting input specification language is appropriate for both languages.</abstract>

Many studies treat Sel as a case marker only (cf. (Berman, 1978) (Yzhar, 1993) (Borer, 1988)). The choice of one of the three forms seems to be stylistic and vary in spoken and written Hebrew (cf. (Berman, 1978), (Glinert, 1989), (Oman, 1964), and discussion in (Seikevicz, 1979)). But, in addition to these pragmatic factors and as is the case for the English genitive, the construct state can realize a wide variety of semantic relations (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), (Azar, 1985), (Levi, 1976). The selection is also a matter of preference ranking among competitors for the same syntactic slot. For example, we have shown in (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b) that the semantic relations that can be realized by a construct state are the ones defined as classifier in SURGE. Therefore, the co-occurrence of such a relation with another classifier leads to a competition for the syntactic slot of &amp;quot;classifier&amp;quot; and also contributes to the decision of how to realize a possessive.

In conclusion, this bilingual analysis has helped us identify important abstractions that lead to more fluent generation in both languages. 2 Possessives and Partitives in Hebrew and English This section briefly presents data on possessives and partitives in English and Hebrew. These observations delimit the questions we address in the paper: when is a genitive construct used to express possessives and when is an explicit partitive used. 2.1 Possessives in English Possessives can be realized in two basic structures: as part of the determiner sequence (Halliday, 1994) (as either a possessive pronoun or a full NP marked with apostrophe-s as a genitive marker) or as a construct NP of NP. In addition to possessive, the genitive marker can realize several semantic relations (Quirk et al., 1985) (pp.192-203): subjective genitive (the boy&apos;s application — the boy applied) , genitive of origin (the girl&apos;s story — the girl told a story), objective genitive, descriptive genitive (a women&apos;s college — a college for woman). As a consequence of this versatility, the general decision of apostrophe vs. of is not trivial: Quirk claims that the higher on the gender scale, i</context>

A partitive relation can be realized in two main ways: as part of the pre-determiner sequence (Halliday, 1994), (Winograd, 1983) using quantifiers that have a partitive meaning (e.g., some/most/many/one-third (of the) children) or using a construction of the form a measure/X of Y. There are three subtypes of the partitive construction ((Quirk et al., 1985)[p.130], (Halliday, 1994)): measure a mile of cable, typical partitives a loaf of bread, a slice of cake, and general partitives: a piece/bit/of an item of X. In the syntactic structure of a partitive structure, the part is the head of the phrase (and determines agreement), but the Thing - is what is being measured. This creates an interesting differ</context>

It consists of the following main sub-constituents: head, classifier, describer, qualifier and determiner. In previous work (Elhadad, 1996), we discuss how t</context>

Therefore, the co-occurrence of such a relation with another classifier leads to a competition for the syntactic slot of &amp;quot;classifier&amp;quot; and also contributes to the decision of how to realize a possessive.

<context position="8035" citStr="Quirk et al., 1985" startWordPosition="1293" endWordPosition="1296">d English This section briefly presents data on possessives and partitives in English and Hebrew. These observations delimit the questions we address in the paper: when is a genitive construct used to express possessives and when is an explicit partitive used. 2.1 Possessives in English Possessives can be realized in two basic structures: as part of the determiner sequence (Halliday, 1994) (as either a possessive pronoun or a full NP marked with apostrophe-s as a genitive marker) or as a construct NP of NP. In addition to possessive, the genitive marker can realize several semantic relations (Quirk et al., 1985) (pp.192-203): subjective genitive (the boy&apos;s application — the boy applied) , genitive of origin (the girl&apos;s story — the girl told a story), objective genitive, descriptive genitive (a women&apos;s college — a college for woman). As a consequence of this versatility, the general decision of apostrophe vs. of is not trivial: Quirk claims that the higher on the gender scale, i.e., the more animate the noun, the more the possessor realization tends to be realized as an inflected genitive: • Person&apos;s name: Segovia&apos;s pupil • Person&apos;s nouns: the boy&apos;s new shirt • Collective nouns: the nation&apos;s social se</context>

A partitive relation can be realized in two main ways: as part of the pre-determiner sequence (Halliday, 1994), (Winograd, 1983) using quantifiers that have a partitive meaning (e.g., some/most/many/one-third (of the) children) or using a construction of the form a measure/X of Y. There are three subtypes of the partitive construction ((Quirk et al., 1985)[p.130], (Halliday, 1994)): measure a mile of cable, typical partitives a loaf of bread, a slice of cake, and general partitives: a piece/bit/of an item of X. In the syntactic structure of a partitive structure, the part is the head of the phrase (and determines agreement), but the Thing - is what is being measured. This creates an interesting difference between the logical and syntactic structure of the NP. (Mercuk and Perstov, 1987) defines the elective surface syntactic relation which connects an of-phrase to superlative adjectives or numerals. An elective phrase is an elliptical structure:</context>

To explain them, Glinert (Glinert, 1989) adopts a functional perspective, quite appropriate to the needs of a generation system, and identifies a general pattern for the NP, that we use as a basis for the mapping rules in HUGG: [partitive determiner amount head classifiers describers post-det/quant qualifiers] Yzhar and Doron (Doron, 1991) (Yzhar, 1993) distinguish between two sets of determiners, that they call D and Q quantifiers. The distinction is based on syntactic features, such as position, ability to be modified, ability to participate in partitive structures and requirement to agree in number and gender with the head. This distinction is used to explain co-occurrence restrictions, the order of appearance of D vs Q quantifiers and the recursive structure of D determiners: D determiners can be layered on top of other D determiners. A single Q quantifier can occur in an NP and it remains attached closest to the head. In (Dahan-Netzer, </context>
