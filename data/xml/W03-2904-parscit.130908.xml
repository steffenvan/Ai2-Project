Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963666666667">
Word-level morphosyntactic descrip-
tions, such as “Ncmsn” designating a
common masculine singular noun in
the nominative, have been developed
for all Slavic languages, yet there have
been few attempts to arrive at a pro-
posal that would be harmonised across
the languages. Standardisation adds
to the interchange potential of the re-
sources, making it easier to develop
multilingual applications or to evaluate
language technology tools across sev-
eral languages. The process of the
harmonisation of morphosyntactic cat-
egories, esp. for morphologically rich
Slavic languages is also interesting from
a language-typological perspective. The
EU MULTEXT-East project developed
corpora, lexica and tools for seven
languages, with the focus being on
morphosyntactic data, including formal,
EAGLES-based specifications for lexi-
cal morphosyntactic descriptions. The
specifications were later extended, so
that they currently cover nine languages,
five from the Slavic family: Bulgarian,
Croatian, Czech, Serbian and Slovene.
The paper presents these morphosyn-
tactic specifications, giving their back-
ground and structure, including the en-
coding of the tables as TEI feature struc-
tures. The five Slavic language specifi-
cations are discussed in more depth.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993598901099">
The mid-nineties saw — to a large extent via EU
projects — the rapid development of multilingual
language resources and standards for human lan-
guage technologies. However, while the develop-
ment of resources, tools, and standards was well
on its way for EU languages, there had been no
comparable efforts for the languages of Central
and Eastern Europe.
The MULTEXT-East project (Multilingual Text
Tools and Corpora for Eastern and Central Eu-
ropean Languages) was a spin-off of the EU
MULTEXT project (Ide and Véronis, 1994); it
developed standardised language resources for
six languages (Dimitrova et al., 1998): Bulgar-
ian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, and
Slovene, as well as for English, the ’hub’ language
of the project. The main results of the project were
an annotated multilingual corpus (Erjavec and Ide,
1998), comprising a speech corpus, a comparable
corpus and a parallel corpus; lexical resources (Ide
et al., 1998); and tool resources for the seven lan-
guages.
One of the objectives of MULTEXT-East has
been to make its resources freely available for re-
search purposes. In the scope of the TELRI con-
certed action the results of MULTEXT-East have
been extended with several new languages. This
edition is now available via the TELRI Research
Archive of Computational Tools and Resources, at
http://www.tractor.de/.
Following the TELRI release, the MULTEXT-
East resources have been used in a number of
studies and experiments, e.g., (Tufi¸s, 1999; Ha-
jiˇc, 2000; Džeroski et al., 2000). In the course
of such work, errors and inconsistencies were dis-
covered in the MULTEXT-East specifications and
data, most of which were subsequently corrected.
But because this work was done at different sites
and in different manners, the encodings of the re-
sources had begun to drift apart.
The EU Copernicus project CONCEDE, Consor-
tium for Central European Dictionary Encoding,
which ran from ’98 to ’00 and comprised most of
the same partners as MULTEXT-East, offered the
possibility to bring the versions back on a common
footing. Although CONCEDE was primarily de-
voted to machine readable dictionaries and lexical
databases (Erjavec et al., 2000), one of its work-
packages did consider the integration of the dic-
tionary data with the MULTEXT-East corpus. In
the scope of this workpackage, the corrected mor-
phosyntactically annotated corpus was normalised
and re-encoded. This release of the MULTEXT-
East resources (Erjavec, 2001a; Erjavec, 2001b)
contains the revised and expanded morphosyntac-
tic specifications, the revised lexica, and the sig-
nificantly corrected and re-encoded 1984 corpus.
In Table 1, we give all these connected re-
sources by language, type and release. The ones
marked by T belong to the TELRI edition, and
those with C to the Concede edition. A special
case is the Serbian specification, on which we have
started working recently.
The columns distinguish the resource in ques-
tion: “Other Res.” are the multilingual tool spec-
ifications and the speech and comparable corpora,
“1984 Doc” refers to the structurally annotated
parallel Orwell corpus, and “1984 Align” to the
sentence alignments.
By far the most useful part of the MULTEXT-
East project deliverables proved to be the mor-
phosyntactic resources, and these were also taken
forward to Concede. These resources are also in-
cluded in the TELRI edition, but have been since
substantially modified and added to.
Producing this linked set of deliverables was
also by the most labour intensive part of the
project. First, while most MULTEXT-East lan-
guages had pre-existing morphological lexica and
annotations, these had to be 7-way harmonised ac-
cording to the common specifications, a huge task
given not only the diversity of languages but also
of linguistic practices. Furthermore, a morphosyn-
tactically annotated corpus of 100,000 words was,
for most of the languages, the first such resource
to be made. This meant that the annotation had to
be done largely manually, and that the corpus an-
notation process fed back into the lexica and spec-
ifications, through a series of revisions.
The morphosyntactic resources consist of three
layers, listed in order of abstraction:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975972">
1. 1984 MSD: the morphosyntactically anno-
tated 1984 corpus, where each word is as-
signed its context-disambiguated MSD and

<listItem confidence="0.992027875">
2. MSD Lexicons: the morphosyntactic lex-
icons, which contain the full inflectional
paradigms of a superset of the lemmas that
appear in the 1984 corpus. Each entry gives
the word-form, its lemma and MSD, e.g.,

walks walk Ncnp
3. MSD Specs: the morphosyntactic specifica-

tions, which are the topic of this paper. They
set out the grammar of valid morphosyn-
tactic descriptions, MSDs. The specifica-
tions determine what, for each language, is
a valid MSD and what it means, e.g., Ncms
PoS:Noun, Type:common, Gen-
der:masculine, Number:singular
To obtain the corpus and lexica, it is necessary
to fill out a web-based license agreement, which
limits the use of resources to research pruposes.
The specifications, however, are freely available
on the Web, under http://nL.ijs.si/ME/. At the time
of writing, the latest version is V2.1/msd/
The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 discusses the structure of the MULTEXT-
East morphosyntactic specifications and quanti-
fies them; Section 3 explains the specifications for
the Slavic languages; Section 4 turns to the stan-
dardisation of the encoding of the specifications
in XML/TEI, and Section 5 gives the conclusions
and directions for further work.

2 The Morphosyntactic Specifications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999504466666667">
The MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic specifica-
tions give the syntax and semantics of the mor-
phosyntactic descriptions (MSDs) used in the lex-
ica and corpora. The specifications have been de-
veloped in the formalism and on the basis of spec-
ifications for six Western European languages of
the EU MULTEXT project (Ide and Véronis, 1994)
and in cooperation with EAGLES, the Expert Advi-
sory Group on Language Engineering Standards.
Originally, these specifications were released as
a report of the MULTEXT-East project but have,
in the CONCEDE release (Erjavec (ed.), 2001),
been significantly revised. The format of the re-
port has been unified and structured in a more de-
tailed manner (thus leading to an easily naviga-
ble HTML version), the formal specifications for
some languages have been modified. The specifi-
cations have, in the CONCEDE release also gained
a new language, Croatian, and we have recently
also added Serbian to the Specifications.
Technically, the specifications are a LATEX doc-
ument, with derived Postscript, PDF and HTML
renderings, where the common tables are plain
ASCII in a strictly defined format. As will be seen
in Section 4, we have converted these latter into a
TEI/XML encoding.
The MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic specifica-
tions have the following structure: (1) introduc-
tory matter; (2) the common specification; and (3)
a language particular section for each language.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.934834">
2.1 The Common Part
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716178571429">
The common part of the specifications first defines
the parts of speech and their codes; MULTEXT-
East distinguishes the following, where not all PoS
are used for all languages: Noun (N), Verb (V),
Adjective (A), Pronoun (P), Determiner (D), Arti-
cle (T), Adverb (R), Adposition (S), Conjunction
(C), Numeral (M), Interjection (I), Residual (X),
Abbreviation (Y), and Particle (Q).
The common part of the specifications then
gives, for each category, a table defining the at-
tributes appropriate for the category, the values de-
fined for these attributes, and one-letter codes to
identify the values. They also define which lan-
guages distinguish each attribute-value pair. To il-
lustrate, a part of the verb table is given in Table 2.
The morphosyntactic descriptions, MSDs,
are structured and more detailed than is com-
monly the case for part-of-speech tags; they are
compact string representations of a simplified
kind of feature structures. The first letter of a
MSD encodes the part of speech, e.g., Noun or
Adjective. The letters following the PoS give
the values of the position determined attributes.
The specifications define, for each part of speech,
its appropriate attributes, their values and one-
letter codes. So, for example, the Ncmpi MSD
expands to PoS:Noun, Type:common,
Gender:masculine, Number:plural,

Case:instrumental. It should be noted that
in case a certain attribute is not appropriate (1)
for a language, (2) for the particular combination
of features, or (3) for the word in question, this
is marked by a hyphen in the attribute’s position.
Slovene verbs in the indicative, for example, are
not marked for gender or voice, hence the two
hyphens in Vcip3s--n.
The common part of the specifications further
contains two sections, the first giving the complete
list of values with their codes and the attributes
they belong to, and the second listing all the at-
tributes, which PoS they belong to, and — with
the less familiar ones — what their meaning is.
In the context of the common tables, we should
mention the Perl script mtems-expand, which
is — along with various other useful programs —
included in the public msd/bin directory. The pro-
gram parses the common tables of the specifica-
tion, and is then able to either check the validity
of any given MSD or expand the MSD into a more
readable format.
In Table 3 we quantify the specifications and
give, for each language and part-of-speech, the
number of attributes and attribute-value pairs de-
fined in the specification. Where a language does
not use a PoS, that is marked by a hyphen, while if
a PoS is used, but defines no attributes, the value
of zero is given.
The numbers in Table 3 give an idea of the
“weight” of the MSDs for each particular language
and PoS. As can be seen in the bottom right-hand
corner, the full number of defined attributes is over
one hundred with almost five hundred attribute-
value pairs; the Slavic languages define the most
categories, and the Pronoun is the most complex
PoS.

2.2 Language Particular Sections

<bodyText confidence="0.998635428571429">
In the specifications, the common part is followed
by dedicated sections for each particular language,
and we turn to these next. The structure of these
sections can — although need not — be in itself
quite complex. Maximally they contain, for each
PoS category, the following parts: (1) attribute-
value table with notes; (2) allowed combinations

of features with examples; (3) full lists of lexical
MSDs with examples and cardinality.
The minimal content of a language section is
just (1); these are identical to the common ones,
but containing only the relevant pairs for the lan-
guage. These tables can then be further extended,
say with notes and examples, and can even be lo-
calised to the language in question.
In addition to the tables, the MULTEXT-East
languages also have a section giving the feature
co-occurrence restrictions on attribute-value pairs.
These tables specify the allowed combinations of
attribute-values for each PoS, and give a regular
expression grammar of MSDs.
The Combinations Sections are useful in the be-
ginning stages of developing lexica, as they isolate
malformed MSDs in the resources. However, it is
often easier to operate with simple lists of MSDs,
as not all possibilities allowed by combinations ac-
tually occur in the language.
That is why some languages have, instead of
or in addition to the combinations section an ex-
plicit list of valid MSDs per category; these lists
can then serve as a “gold standard” MSD set for
the language; it should be noted that due to rich
inflection, the cardinalities of the Slavic language
MSDs can be well over a thousand.

In this section we further discuss the specifications
for the Slavic languages; in particular, we give the
historical context in which they were developed
and how they related to other MSD tagsets devel-

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993587">
3.1 Bulgarian
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887785714286">
At the time when the MULTEXT-East project
started there existed two wide coverage morpho-
logical lexica for Bulgarian (Morpho-Assistant,
Slovnik), both of which encoded the morphosyn-
tactic features of word forms as lists of attribute-
value pairs. On the basis of Morpho-Assistant two
tagsets were defined: the Bulgarian part of the
EAGLES tagset and the LML tagset. On the basis
of Slovnik lexicon also two tagsets were defined
– first, the Bulgarian part of the MULTEXT-East
tagset, which was then extended and localised to
Bulgarian (using Cyrillic letters). The two Bulgar-
ian tagsets – LML and Slovnik – are richer than
EAGLES and MULTEXT-East tagsets; for a com-
parison with the LML tagset and discussion see
(Slavcheva, 1997).
For the purposes of the BulTreeBank project
(Simov et al., 2002), the Slovnik tagset was
adapted by having been converted into a Latin for-
mat and modified in several ways: there were in-
troduced separate tags for the auxiliary verbs and
a hybrid POS tag referring to family names and
adjectives derived from names; the pronoun ad-
verbials were made more fine-grained etc. This
tagset is being used for the annotation of the Bul-
TreeBank Text Archive. The lexicon is encoded
as a regular grammar within the CLaRK system
(Simov et al., 2001).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997201">
3.2 Croatian
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999658666666666">
The Croatian specifications were compiled soon
after the MULTEXT-East project ended in 1997,
using the project’s Final report as the template.
These specifications are used in the PoS-tagging
and lemmatisation of the Croatian National Cor-
pus (Tadi´c, 2002). It was also selected for the for-
mat of MSDs accompanying word-forms in Croa-
tian Morphological Lexicon (Tadi´c, 2003) which
is conformant with MULTEXT-East lexica.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998863">
3.3 Czech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99093575">
The morphological specifications for Czech were
developed exclusively for the MULTEXT-East
project but the authors had already had some expe-
rience with the first draft of morphological speci-
fications for Czech which is now thoroughly de-
scribed in (Hajiˇc, 2002). These specifications and
the resulting tagset developed by Hajiˇc are nowa-
days used as a standard for morphological and
morphosyntactic annotations of the majority of
Czech corpora, especially the 100 million word
corpus of synchronic Czech developed within the
Czech National Corpus project. From the present
viewpoint, the MULTEXT-East specifications for
Czech can be regarded as a subset of this stan-
dard. The formalism of both annotation schemes
is similar in that both use positional attributes, the
important difference being that in MULTEXT-East
the attribute position is PoS-dependent, whereas in
the standard specifications each attribute is always
identified with a fixed position in the tag string.
Among the Czech morphologically annotated
corpora, only the Czech translation of 1984 is
annotated by the MULTEXT-East specifications.
The MULTEXT-East annotation of this corpus was
mapped to the standard annotation, i.e., both 1984
corpora differing only in the tagsets used can now
be accessed – both are included in the Czech Na-
tional Corpus.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.969946">
3.4 Serbian
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999659178571428">
The Serbian language did not have its represen-
tative either in the MULTEXT-East project nor in
Concede. The researchers from the Faculty of
Mathematics, however, participated in both the
TELRI-I and TELRI-II concerted actions. One
of the results of this participation was the Serbian
1984 Doc corpus, but the morphosyntactic speci-
fication, lexicon and MSD tagged 1984 were not
produced.
Independently of these European projects, the
same team was working on the production of a
Serbian morphological lexicon (Duško Vitas and
Cvetana Krstev, 2001) in the format of the INTEX
system, which is based on the technology of finite-
state transducers (Silberztein, 2000).
The team from the Faculty of Belgrade plans to
convert its INTEX lexicon to a MSD-type lexicon.
It is to be expected that Serbian MSDs will not dif-
fer much from the Croatian ones, as Serbian and
Croatian are at the morphological level very sim-
ilar. The combination of features and lexicon it-
self will exhibit more differences. A further plan
is to produce the annotated version of 1984 that
will also be used in the scope of BalkaNet project
for the validation of the Serbian WordNet being
produced, along with the other languages involved
in both MULTEXT-East and BalkaNet, i.e., Czech,
Bulgarian and Romanian.

3.5 Slovene
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973705882353">
The first version of the Slovene specifications
was produced in the scope of the MULTEXT-East
project. The second version of the guidelines was
produced for the 100 million word FIDA Slovene
reference corpus, (Krek et al., 1998). Here the
specifications were revised and localised. In par-
ticular, all the PoS, attribute, and value names,
as well as value codes have been translated into
Slovene; the Slovene MSDs are used in the FIDA
corpus. The localisation is achieved by extend-
ing the tables with additional columns, giving the
translation of the symbol(s) and code.
The FIDA MSD specifications were subse-
quently harmonised with the common MULTEXT-
East tables and then released in the context of
CONCEDE; since then they have been used in a
number of other corpus projects.

4 The TEI encoding
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958913793104">
As has been mentioned, the complete specifica-
tions are written in LATEX, where the common ta-
bles are plain ASCII in a strictly defined format.
This, over time, has proved to be a good choice,
as the format had to be portable and durable, as
well as useful for further processing. While we
did write several Perl scripts to process or use the
common tables, their structure and that of other
parts of the specifications (e.g., the combinations)
are still quite implicit, and writing a parsing pro-
gram is not trivial.
For re-use it would certainly be beneficial if the
specifications were converted into a standard in-
terchange format, with the obvious choice being
XML. As the MULTEXT-East corpus is already
encoded in TEI (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard,
2002), we pursued the option of using already ex-
isting TEI tag-sets to encode (parts of) the specifi-
cations.
We have defined the MSD IDs in a TEI feature-
value library. Additionally, we have also taken the
common tables of the specifications and converted
these to a TEI feature library, and provided a de-
composition from the IDs (MSDs) to the attribute-
values and their names.
First, we needed to define the list of all valid
MSDs. This, of course, includes the MSDs used in
the corpus, but also the MSDs culled from the lex-
icons; this list then constitutes the authoritative set
of valid MSDs for each particular language, and is
also included in the language specific sections of
the specification.
The MSDs are then encoded as a feature
structure library, fsLib , where each MSD is
expressed as a feature structure specifying its
type (the category, i.e., Part of Speech), the
language(s) the MSD is appropriate for, and its
decomposition into features. The value of feats
is of type IDREFs, i.e., it contains pointers to the
definitions of the attribute/value pairs, e.g., &lt;fs
id=&amp;quot;Npmpa&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;Noun&amp;quot; select=&amp;quot;cs
sl&amp;quot; feats=&amp;quot;N1.p N2.m N3.p N4.a&amp;quot;/&gt;
The attribute/value pair definitions are given
in the common tables of the morphosyntac-
tic specifications and are encoded as a TEI
feature library, fLib . For each feature we
give, apart from its identifier, the languages
it is appropriate for and the full name of its
attribute, while its value is encoded as the con-
tent of the feature, as a symbol with the full
name of its value, e.g., &lt;f id=&amp;quot;N4.a&amp;quot; se-
lect=&amp;quot;cs hu sl&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;Case&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;sym
value=&amp;quot;accusative&amp;quot;/&gt;
In the corpus, both libraries are stored in a
dedicated corpus element, together with the TEI
header. Eventually, the complete morphosyntactic
specifications should be converted from LATEX to
TEI and stored in this element.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990444444445">
The paper presented the EAGLES &amp; MULTEXT-
based multilingual morphosyntactic specifica-
tions, which currently include five Slavic lan-
guages. Presented were the MULTEXT-East
project deliverables and their various editions, esp.
those that deal with morphosyntactic resources.
The structure and formats of the specifications
were discussed, and the Slavic languages intro-
duced in more depth.
As mentioned, of the current Slavic languages,
Croatian and Serbian do not yet have the lexical
and corpus resource utilising the MSDs defined in
the specifications; we hope to remedy this short-
coming sometime in the future, as only with such
resources can we validate, quantify and exemplify
the specifications. It should be noted that both lan-
guages already have lexica that need only to be
converted to MULTEXT-East MSDs but producing
the MSD tagged 1984 corpus is more complex;
while both languages already have the text in digi-
tal form, the manual annotation of 100,000 tokens
with MSDs is a labour intensive process.
The format of the specifications makes it quite
easy to add new languages, although choosing
which attributes and values to use, and which
word-forms and lemmas to assign them too is far
from simple, not only because of the difference in
languages, but also due to different linguistic tra-
ditions as well as computational models.
In our further work on the specifications, it
would be of course beneficial to add new lan-
guages, and also to re-evaluate some current
choices in the specifications. On the encoding
side, we would like to move to complete speci-
fications to a full TEI/XML encoding and XSLT
processing.

<abstract confidence="0.999110529411765">Word-level morphosyntactic descriptions, such as “Ncmsn” designating a common masculine singular noun in the nominative, have been developed for all Slavic languages, yet there have been few attempts to arrive at a proposal that would be harmonised across the languages. Standardisation adds to the interchange potential of the resources, making it easier to develop multilingual applications or to evaluate language technology tools across several languages. The process of the harmonisation of morphosyntactic categories, esp. for morphologically rich Slavic languages is also interesting from a language-typological perspective. The project developed corpora, lexica and tools for seven languages, with the focus being on morphosyntactic data, including formal, EAGLES-based specifications for lexical morphosyntactic descriptions. The specifications were later extended, so that they currently cover nine languages, five from the Slavic family: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Serbian and Slovene. The paper presents these morphosyntactic specifications, giving their background and structure, including the encoding of the tables as TEI feature structures. The five Slavic language specifications are discussed in more depth.</abstract>

The five Slavic language specifications are discussed in more depth. 1 Introduction The mid-nineties saw — to a large extent via EU projects — the rapid development of multilingual language resources and standards for human language technologies. However, while the development of resources, tools, and standards was well on its way for EU languages, there had been no comparable efforts for the languages of Central and Eastern Europe. The MULTEXT-East project (Multilingual Text Tools and Corpora for Eastern and Central European Languages) was a spin-off of the EU MULTEXT project (Ide and Véronis, 1994); it developed standardised language resources for six languages (Dimitrova et al., 1998): Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Slovene, as well as for English, the ’hub’ language of the project. The main results of the project were an annotated multilingual corpus (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), comprising a speech corpus, a comparable corpus and a parallel corpus; lexical resources (Ide et al., 1998); and tool resources for the seven languages.

The specifications have been developed in the formalism and on the basis of specifications for six Western European languages of the EU MULTEXT project (Ide and Véronis, 1994) and in cooperation with EAGLES, the Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards. Originally, these specifications were released as a report of the MULTEXT-East project but have, in the CONCEDE release (Erjavec (ed.), 2001), been significantly revised. The format of the report has been unified and structured in a more detailed manner (thus leading to an easily navigable HTML version), the formal specifications for some languages have been modified. The specifications have, in the CONCEDE release also gained a new language, Croatian, and we have recently also added Serbian to the Sp</context>

The researchers from the Faculty of Mathematics, however, participated in both the TELRI-I and TELRI-II concerted actions. One of the results of this participation was the Serbian 1984 Doc corpus, but the morphosyntactic specification, lexicon and MSD tagged 1984 were not produced. Independently of these European projects, the same team was working on the production of a Serbian morphological lexicon (Duško Vitas and Cvetana Krstev, 2001) in the format of the INTEX system, which is based on the technology of finitestate transducers (Silberztein, 2000). The team from the Faculty of Belgrade plans to convert its INTEX lexicon to a MSD-type lexicon. It is to be expected that Serbian MSDs will not differ much from the Croatian ones, as Serbian and Croatian are at the morphological level very similar. The combination of features and lexicon itself will exhibit more differences. A further plan is to produce the annotated version of 1984 that will also be used in the scope of BalkaNet project for the validation of the Serbian WordNet being produced, along with the other languages involved in both MULTEXT-East and BalkaNet, i.e., Czech, Bulgarian </context>
