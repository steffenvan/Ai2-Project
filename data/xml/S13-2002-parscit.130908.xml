The ClearTK-TimeML submission to Temp-
Eval 2013 competed in all English tasks: identi-
fying events, identifying times, and identifying
temporal relations. The system is a pipeline of
machine-learning models, each with a small set
of features from a simple morpho-syntactic an-
notation pipeline, and where temporal relations
are only predicted for a small set of syntac-
tic constructions and relation types. ClearTK-
TimeML ranked 1st for temporal relation F1,
time extent strict F1 and event tense accuracy.

<bodyText confidence="0.999853307692308">
The TempEval shared tasks (Verhagen et al., 2007;
Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013) have
been one of the key venues for researchers to com-
pare methods for temporal information extraction. In
TempEval 2013, systems are asked to identify events,
times and temporal relations in unstructured text.
This paper describes the ClearTK-TimeML system
submitted to TempEval 2013. This system is based
off of the ClearTK framework for machine learning
(Ogren et al., 2008)1, and decomposes TempEval
2013 into a series of sub-tasks, each of which is for-
mulated as a machine-learning classification problem.
The goals of the ClearTK-TimeML approach were:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991402166666667">
• To use a small set of simple features that can be
derived from either tokens, part-of-speech tags or
syntactic constituency parses.
• To restrict temporal relation classification to a sub-
set of constructions and relation types for which
the models are most confident.

<bodyText confidence="0.998848818181818">
Thus, each classifier in the ClearTK-TimeML
pipeline uses only the features shared by success-
ful models in previous work (Bethard and Martin,
2006; Bethard and Martin, 2007; Llorens et al., 2010;
UzZaman and Allen, 2010) that can be derived from
a simple morpho-syntactic annotation pipeline2. And
each of the temporal relation classifiers is restricted
to a particular syntactic construction and to a partic-
ular set of temporal relation labels. The following
sections describe the models, classifiers and datasets
behind the ClearTK-TimeML approach.

4 Temporal relation models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965090909091">
Three different models, described below, were trained
for temporal relation identification. All models fol-
lowed a multi-class classification approach, pairing
an event and a time or an event and an event, and
trying to predict a temporal relation type (BEFORE,
AFTER, INCLUDES, etc.) or NORELATION if there
was no temporal relation between the pair.
While the training and evaluation data allowed
for 14 possible relation types, each of the temporal
relation models was restricted to a subset of relations,
with all other relations mapped to the NORELATION
type. The subset of relations for each model was
selected by inspecting the confusion matrix of the
model’s errors on the training data, and removing
relations that were frequently confused and whose
removal improved performance on the training data.
Event to document creation time relations were
classified by considering (event, time) pairs where
each event in the text was paired with the document
creation time. The classifier was restricted to the rela-
tions BEFORE, AFTER and INCLUDES. The follow-
ing features were used to characterize such relations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994994">
• The event’s aspect (as classified above)
• The event’s class (as classified above)
• The event’s modality (as classified above)
• The event’s polarity (as classified above)
• The event’s tense (as classified above)
• The text of the event, only if the event was identi-
fied as having class ASPECTUAL

movements through the tree: ˆ((NP|PP|ADVP)↑)*
((VP|SBAR|S)↑)* (S|SBAR|VP|NP) (↓(VP|SBAR|S))*
(↓(NP|PP|ADVP))*$. The classifier relations were re-

The best classifier for each training data set was
selected via a grid search over classifiers and param-

selected to provide several reasonable values for each
classifier parameter. Each (classifier, parameters)

validation on the training data, and the best perform-
ing (classifier, parameters) was selected as the final
model to run on the TempEval 2013 test set.

Training on the AQUAINT (AQ) data in addition to
the TimeBank (TB) hurt times and relations. Adding
the AQUAINT data caused a -2.7 drop in extent preci-
sion, a -8.0 drop in extent recall, a -1.8 drop in value
accuracy and a -0.4 drop in type accuracy, and a -3.6
to -4.3 drop in relation recall.
Training on the “Silver” (SLV) data in addition
to TB+AQ data gave mixed results. There were big
gains for time extent precision (+8.4), time value ac-
curacy (+3.7), event extent recall (+2.5) and event
class accuracy (+2.3), but a big drop for event tense
accuracy (-6.6). Relation recall improved (+2.7 with
system events and times, +6.0 with manual) but pre-
cision varied (-4.4 with system, +1.6 with manual).
Adding verb-clause relations (BMK) and closure-
inferred relations (PM) increased recall but low-
ered precision. With system-annotated events and
times, the change was +2.2/-0.4 (recall/precision)
for verb-clause relations, and +0.7/-1.2 for closure-
inferred relations. With manually-annotated events
and times, the change was +2.2/-0.3 for verb-clause
relations, and (the one exception where recall im-
proved) +1.5/+1.9 for closure-inferred relations.

Overall, the ClearTK-TimeML ranked 1st in relation
F1, time extent strict F1 and event tense accuracy.
Analysis across the different ClearTK-TimeML
runs showed that including annotations from the
AQUAINT corpus hurt model performance across
a variety of tasks. A manual inspection of the
AQUAINT corpus revealed many annotation errors,
suggesting that the drop may be the result of attempt-
ing to learn from inconsistent training data. The
AQUAINT corpus may thus have to be partially re-
annotated to be useful as a training corpus.
Analysis also showed that adding more relation
annotations increased recall, typically at the cost of
precision, even though the added annotations were
highly accurate: (Bethard et al., 2007) reported agree-
ment of 90%, and temporal closure relations were
100% deterministic from the already-annotated re-
lations. One would expect that adding such high-
quality relations would only improve performance.
But not all temporal relations were annotated by the
TempEval 2013 annotators, so the system could be
marked wrong for a finding a true temporal relation
that was not noticed by the annotators. Further analy-
sis is necessary to investigate this hypothesis.
