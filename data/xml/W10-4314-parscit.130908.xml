Temporal analysis of events is a central
problem in computational models of dis-
course. However, correctly recognizing
temporal aspects of events poses serious
challenges. This paper introduces a joint
modeling framework and feature set for
temporal analysis of events that utilizes
Markov Logic. The feature set includes
novel features derived from lexical on-
tologies. An evaluation suggests that in-
troducing lexical relation features im-
proves the overall accuracy of temporal

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999935857142857">
Reasoning about the temporal aspects of events
is a critical task in discourse understanding.
Temporal analysis techniques contribute to a
broad range of applications including question
answering and document summarization, but
temporal reasoning is complex. A recent series of
shared task evaluation challenges proposed a
framework with standardized sets of temporal
analysis tasks, including identifying the temporal
entities mentioned in text, such as events and
time expressions, as well as identifying the tem-
poral relations that hold between those temporal
entities (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009).
Our previous work (Ha et al., 2010) addressed
modeling temporal relations between temporal
entities and proposed a supervised machine-
learning approach with Markov Logic (ML)
(Richardson and Domingos, 2006). As novel fea-
tures, we introduced two types of lexical rela-
tions derived from VerbOcean (Chklovski and
Pantel, 2004) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). A
preliminary evaluation showed the effectiveness
of our approach. In this paper, we extend our
previous work and conduct a more rigorous
evaluation, focusing on the impact of joint opti-
mization of the features and the effectiveness of
the lexical relation features for modeling tempo-
ral relations.

Recently, data-driven approaches to modeling
temporal relations for written text have been
gaining momentum. Boguraev and Ando (2005)
apply a semi-supervised learning technique to
recognize events and to infer temporal relations
between time expressions and their anchored
events. Mani et al. (2006) model temporal rela-
tions between events as well as between events
and time expressions using maximum entropy
classifiers. The participants of TempEval-1 in-
vestigate a variety of techniques for temporal
analysis of text (Verhagen et al., 2007).
While most data-driven techniques model
temporal relations as local pairwise classifiers,
this approach has the limitation that there is no
systematic mechanism to ensure global consis-
tencies among predicted temporal relations (e.g.,
if event A happens before event B and event B
happens before event C, then A should happen
before C). To avoid this drawback, a line of re-
search has explored techniques for the global
optimization of local classifier decisions. Cham-
bers and Jurafsky (2008) add global constraints
over local classifiers using Integer Linear Pro-
gramming. Yoshikawa et al. (2009) jointly model
related temporal classification tasks using ML.
These approaches are shown to improve the ac-
curacy of temporal relation models.
Our work is most closely related to Yoshikawa
et al. (2009) in that ML is used for joint model-

in three primary respects. First, we introduce
new lexical relation features. Second, our model

Third, we employ phrase-based syntactic features

3 Data and Tasks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763128205128">
We use the TempEval-2 data for English for both
training and testing of our temporal relation
models. The data includes 162 news articles (to-
taling about 53,000 tokens) as the training set
and another 11 news articles as the test set. The
corpus is labeled with events, time expressions,
and temporal relations. Each labeled event and
time expression is further annotated with seman-
tic and syntactic attributes. Six types of temporal
relations are considered: before, after, overlap,
before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after, and vague.
Consider the following example from the
TempEval-2 data, marked up with a time expres-
sion t1 and three events e1, e2, and e3, where e1
and e2 are the main events of the first and the
second sentences, respectively, and e3 is syntac-
tically dominated by e2.
But a [minute and a half]t1
later, a pilot from a nearby
flight [calls]e1 in. Ah, we
just [saw]e2 an [explosion]e3
up ahead of us here about
sixteen thousand feet or
something like that.
In the first sentence, t1 and e1 are linked by a
temporal relation overlap. Temporal relation af-
ter holds between the two consecutive main
events: e1 occurs after e2. The main event e2 of
the second sentence overlaps with e3, which is
syntactically dominated by e2.
In this paper, we focus on three subproblems
of the temporal relation identification task as de-
fined by TempEval-2: identifying temporal rela-
tions between (1) events and time expressions in
the same sentence (ET); (2) two main events in
consecutive sentences (MM); and (3) two events
in the same sentence when one syntactically
dominates another (MS), which is a new task in-
troduced in TempEval-2.

4 Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988515151515">
Surface features include the word tokens and
stems of the words. In the TempEval-2 data, an
event always consists of a single word token, but
time expressions often consist of multiple tokens.
We treat the entire string of words in a given
time expression as a single feature.
Semantic features are the semantic attributes
of individual events and time expressions de-
scribed in Section 3. In this work, we use the
gold-standard values for these features that were
manually assigned by human annotators in the
training and the test data.
Syntactic features include three features
adopted from Bethard and Martin (2007): gov-
prep, any prepositions governing the event or
time expression (e.g., Ôfor’ in ‘for ten years’);
gov-verb, the verb governing the event or time
expression; gov-verb-pos, the part-of-speech
(pos) tag of the governing verb. We also consider
the pos tag of the word in the event and the time
expression.
Lexical relations are the semantic relations be-
tween two events derived from VerbOcean
(Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998). VerbOcean contains five types
of relations (similarity, strength, antonymy, en-
ablement, and happens-before) that commonly
occur between pairs of verbs. To overcome data
sparseness, we expanded the original VerbOcean
database by calculating symmetric and transitive
closures of key relations. With WordNet, a se-
mantic distance between the associated tokens of
each target event pair was computed.

5 Modeling Temporal Relations with
Markov Logic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996534142857143">
ML is a statistical relational learning framework
that provides a template language for defining
Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). A MLN is a
set of weighted first-order clauses constituting a
Markov network in which each ground formula
represents a feature (Richardson and Domingos,
2006).
Our MLN consists of a set of formulae com-
bining two types of predicates: hidden and ob-
served. Hidden predicates are those that are not
directly observable during test time. A hidden
predicate is defined for each task: relEventTimex
(temporal relation between an event and a time
expression), relMainEvents (temporal relation
between two main events), and relMainSub
(temporal relation between a main and a domi-
nated event). Observed predicates are those that
can be fully observed during test time and repre-
sent each of the features described in Section 4.
The following is an example formula used in
our MLN:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.736399666666667">
76
eventTimex(d, e, t) eventWord(d, e, w)
relEventTimex(d, e, t, r) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665909090909">
The predicate eventTimex(d, e, t) represents the
existence of a candidate pair of event e and time
expression t in a document d. Given this candi-
date pair, formula (1) assigns weights to a tem-
poral relation r whenever it observes a word to-
ken w in the given event from the training data.
This formula is local because it considers only
one hidden predicate (relEventTimex).
In addition to local formulae, we also define a
set of global formulae to ensure consistency be-
tween local decisions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9982955">
relEventTimex(d, e1, t, r1) relEventTimex(d,
e2, t, r2) relMainSub(d, e1, e2, r3) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981688">
Formula (2) is global because it jointly concerns
more than one hidden predicate (relEventTimex
and relMainSub) at the same time. This formula
ensures consistency between the predicted tem-
poral relations r1, r2, and r3 given a main event
e1, a syntactically dominated event e2, and a time
expression t shared by both of these events. Two
additional global formulae (3) and (4) are simi-
larly defined to ensure consistency as below.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911909090909">
To evaluate the proposed approach, we built and
compared two models: one model (NoLex) used
all of the features described in Section 4 except
for the lexical relation features, and the other
model (Full) included the full set of features. The
features were generated using the Porter
Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer in NLTK
(Loper and Bird, 2002) and the Charniak Parser
(Charniak, 2000). The semantic distance between
two word tokens was computed using the path-
similarity metric provided by NLTK. All of the
models were constructed using Markov TheBeast
(Riedel, 2008)
The feature set was optimized for each task on
a held-out development data set consisting of
approximately 10% of the entire training set (Ta-
ble 1). Our previous work (Ha et al., 2010) ob-
served that a local optimization approach that
selects for each individual task (i.e., each hidden
predicate in the given MLN) in isolation from the
other tasks could harm the overall accuracy of a
joint model because of resulting inconsistencies

among individual tasks. In the new experiment
described in this section, features were selected
for each task to improve overall accuracy of the
joint model combining all three tasks, similar to
Yoshikawa et al. (2009).
Table 2 reports the resulting performance (F1
scores) of the models. To isolate the potential
effects of global constraints, we first compare the
accuracies of the Full and the NoLex model, av-
eraged from a ten-fold cross validation on the
training data before global constraints are added.
Full achieves relative 12% and 3% improve-
ments over NoLex for temporal relation between
events and time expressions (ET) and between
two main events (MM), respectively. The im-
provement for MM was statistically significant
(p&lt;0.05) from a two-tailed paired t-test. Note
that the ET task itself does not use lexical rela-
tion features but still achieves an improved result
in Full over NoLex. This is an effect of joint
modeling. There is a slight degradation (relative
2%) in the accuracy for temporal relations be-
tween main and syntactically dominated events
(MS). Overall, Full achieves relative 5% im-
provement over NoLex. A similar trend of per-
formance improvement in Full over NoLex was
observed when the global formulae were added
to each model. The second column (Global Con-
straints) of Table 2 compares the two models
trained on the entire training set and tested on the
test set after the global formulae were added.
However, no statistical significance was found
on these improvements. Compared to the state-

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
Temporal relations can be modeled with Markov
Logic using a variety of features including lexi-
cal ontologies. Three tasks relating to the Tem-
pEval-2 data were addressed: predicting tempo-
ral relations between (1) events and time expres-
sions in the same sentence, (2) two main events
in consecutive sentences, and (3) two events in
the same sentence when one syntactically domi-
nates the other. An evaluation suggests that util-
izing lexical relation features within a joint mod-
eling framework using Markov Logic achieves
state-of-the-art performance.
The results suggest a promising direction for
future work. The proposed approach assumes
events and time expressions are already marked
in the data. To construct a fully automatic tempo-
ral relation identification system, the approach
needs to be extended to include models that rec-
ognize events and time expressions in text as
well as their semantic attributes. A data-driven
approach similar to the one described in this pa-
per may be feasible for this new modeling task. It
will entail exploring a variety of features to fur-
ther understand the complexity underlying the
problem of temporal analysis of events.

We also consider the pos tag of the word in the event and the time expression. Lexical relations are the semantic relations between two events derived from VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). VerbOcean contains five types of relations (similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement, and happens-before) that commonly occur between pairs of verbs. To overcome data sparseness, we expanded the original VerbOcean database by calculating symmetric and transitive closures of key relations. With WordNet, a semantic distance between the associated tokens of each target event pair was computed. 5 Modeling Temporal Relations with Markov Logic ML is a statistical relational learning framework that provides a template language for defining Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)</context>

A MLN is a set of weighted first-order clauses constituting a Markov network in which each ground formula represents a feature (Richardson and Domingos, 2006). Our MLN consists of a set of formulae combining two types of predicates: hidden and observed. Hidden predicates are those that are not directly observable during test time. A hidden predicate is defined for each task: relEventTimex (temporal relation between an event and a time expression), relMainEvents (temporal relation between two main events), and relMainSub (temporal relation between a main and a dominated event). Observed predicates are those that can be fully observed during test time and represent each of the features described in Section 4. The following is an example formula used </context>
