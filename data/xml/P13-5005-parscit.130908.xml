1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753076923077">
This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a clear
notion of the linguistic and distributional charac-
teristics of multiword expressions (MWEs), their
relevance for robust automated natural language
processing and language technology, what meth-
ods and resources are available to support their
use, and what more could be done in the future.
Our target audience are researchers and practition-
ers in language technology, not necessarily experts
in MWEs, who are interested in tasks that involve
or could benefit from considering MWEs as a per-
vasive phenomenon in human language and com-
munication.

2 Topic Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976201923077">
Multiword expressions (MWEs) like break down,
bus stop and make ends meet, are expressions con-
sisting of two or more lexical units that correspond
to some conventional way of saying things (Sag et
al., 2001). They range over linguistic construc-
tions such as fixed phrases (per se, by and large),
noun compounds (telephone booth, cable car),
compound verbs (give a presentation), idioms (a
frog in the throat, kill some time), etc. They are
also widely known as collocations, for the frequent
co-occurrence of their components (Manning and
Sch¨utze, 2001).
From a natural language processing perspective,
the interest in MWEs comes from the very im-
portant role they play forming a large part of hu-
man language, which involves the use of linguistic
routines or prefabricated sequences in any kind of
text or speech, from the terminology of a specific
domain (parietal cortex, substantia nigra, splice
up) to the more colloquial vocabulary (freak out,
make out, mess up) and the language of the social
media (hash tag, fail whale, blackbird pie). New
MWEs are constantly being introduced in the lan-
guage (cloud services, social networking site, se-
curity apps), and knowing how they are used re-
flects the ability to successfully understand and
generate language.
While easily mastered by native speakers, their
treatment and interpretation involves consider-
able effort for computational systems (and non-
native speakers), due to their idiosyncratic, flexi-
ble and heterogeneous nature (Rayson et al., 2010;
Ramisch et al., to appear). First of all, there is
the task of identifying whether a given sequence
of words is an MWE or not (e.g. give a gift vs.
a presentation) (Pecina, 2008; Green et al., 2013;
Seretan, 2012). For a given MWE, there is also the
problem of determining whether it forms a com-
positional (take away the dishes), semi-idiomatic
(boil up the beans) or idiomatic combination (roll
up your sleeves) (Kim and Nakov, 2011; Shutova
et al., 2013). Furthermore, MWEs may also be
polysemous: bring up as carrying (bring up the
bags), raising (bring up the children) and men-
tioning (bring up the subject). Unfortunately, so-
lutions that are successfully employed for treating
similar problems in the context of simplex works
may not be adequate for MWEs, given the com-
plex interactions between their component words
(e.g. the idiomatic use of spill in spilling beans
as revealing secrets vs. its literal usage in spilling
lentils).

This tutorial consists of four parts. Part I starts
with a thorough introduction to different types of
MWEs and collocations, their linguistic dimen-
sions (idiomaticity, syntactic and semantic fixed-
ness, specificity, etc.), as well as their statisti-
cal characteristics (variability, recurrence, associa-
tion, etc.). This part concludes with an overview of
linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of MWEs
to date.
For MWEs to be useful for language tech-
nology, they must be recognisable automatically.

Hence, Part II surveys computational approaches
for MWEs recognition, both manually-authored
approaches and using machine learning tech-
niques, and for modeling syntactic and semantic
variability. We will also review token identifica-
tion and disambiguation of MWEs in context (e.g.
bus stop in Does the bus stop here? vs. The bus
stop is here) and methods for the automatic detec-
tion of the degree of compositionality of MWEs
and their interpretation. Part II finishes with a dis-
cussion of evaluation for MWE tasks.
Part III of the tutorial describes resources made
available for a wide range of languages as well
as MWE-related multi-level annotation platforms
and examples of where MWEs treatment can con-
tribute to language technology tasks and appli-
cations such as parsing, word sense disambigua-
tion, machine translation, information extraction
and information retrieval. Part IV concludes with
a list of future possibilities and open challenges in
the computational treatment of MWEs in current
NLP models and techniques.
