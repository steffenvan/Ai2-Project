A computer program for synthesizing Japanese fundamental
frequency contours implements our theory of Japanese intonation.
This theory provides a complete qualitative description of the
known characteristics of Japanese intonation, as well as a
quantitative model of tone-scaling and timing precise enough to
translate straightforwardly into a computational algorithm. An
important aspect of the description is that various features of the
intonation pattern are designated to be phonological properties of
different types of phrasal units in a hierarchical organization.
This phrasal organization is known to play an important role in
parsing speech. Our research shows it also to be one reflex of
intonational prominence, and hence of focus and other discourse
structures. The qualitative features of each phrasal level and their
implementation in the synthesis program are described.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990978125">
In this paper, we will present a computer program for
synthesizing fundamental frequency contours for standard
Japanese. Fundamental frequency (M) is the paramount physical
correlate of the sensation of pitch, and, in many languages, the
time course of f0 is one of the primary phonetic manifestations of
intonation. This is especially true in Japanese, where duration
and amplitude do not have the consequential role in
communicating intonational structure that they do in English
(Beckman, 1986). Accordingly, a program for synthesizing
Japanese f0 contours is tantamount to a computational
implementation of a theory of Japanese intonation.
The theory that we have implemented in our synthesis
program is based on a review of the literature in English and
Japanese, and on the results of an extensive series of experiments
in which we examined and made f0 measurements of about 2500
intonation contours in order to resolve some of the many problems
not answered in the literature. These experiments have uncovered
important facts about the hierarchical structure underlying
Japanese prosody and about the manifestations of focus in
Japanese. We have incorporated these discoveries in our synthesis
program, which, we believe, covers all known qualitative
characteristics of Japanese intonational melody. Informal
listening tests by Japanese speakers indicate that the 1.0 contours
which the program produces sound quite natural. In some cases,
the synthesized contours were even preferred to the genuine
human intonation contours on which they are modeled.
Although the main concern of our research was to provide an
accurate phonological and phonetic characterization of Japanese
intonational structure that could be used in the automatic
computation of f0 contours, our description of Japanese prosodic
phrasing and intonation synthesis is also of direct relevance to
issues in several other areas, including the role of prosodic

phrasing in the parsing of speech, the relationship between
intonational patterns and discourse phenomena such as focus, and
the development of a more accurate understanding of the
phonological mechanisms of intonation as a universal component
of human speech. The computer implementation of the theory in
turn should provide a practical tool for further research in these
areas. These other background issues are discussed in Sections
1.1-1.3. Section 2 then summarizes the characteristics of Japanese
intonation that we have incorporated in our synthesis program,
and Section 3 gives a detailed account of the program itself.

1.1 Prosodic Phrasing and Syntactic Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821375">
Prosodic organization of the sort that we discovered for
Japanese bears strongly on current issues in syntactic parsing. It
is well known that intonational phrase boundaries can play a
crucial role in parsing speech. For example, if the sentence in (1)
is said without any internal phrase boundaries, it produces a
garden path; the human parser interprets several bugs as the
object of left, and then is unable to arrive at a syntactic role for
the final verb phrase.

<listItem confidence="0.5457615">
(1) When we left several bugs in the program still hadn&apos;t been
corrected.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98476975">
On the other hand, if the sentence is produced with the intonation
break indicated by the comma in (2), several bugs is readily
interpreted as the subject of the main clause.
(2) When we left, several bugs in the program still hadn&apos;t been
corrected.
Intonation breaks can also be used to disambiguate sentences
with ambiguous scope of negation or conjunction. Thus in
example (3), the break represented by the comma forces the
reading in which the scope of negation is the main verb clause
(Because they were mad, they didn&apos;t leave), as opposed to the
reading in which the scope of negation is the subordinate clause (It
was not because they were mad that they left).
(3) They didn&apos;t leave, because they were mad.
Similarly in (4), the break after mnemonic rhyme prevents sublime
from modifying free meter, whereas under the alternative phrasing
in (5), sublime is taken to modify both conjuncts.

In reviewing these examples, we have spoken as if there were
only one type of intonational phrase boundary. And the most
substantial current proposal about the role of intonational
phrasing in the parsing of Japanese (Marcus and Hindle, 1985)
takes into account only a single level of phrasing. In actuality,
however, Japanese and English both have several different types
of intonational phrase, which are related to each other
hierarchically.2 As Marcus and Hindle point out to us, major
modifications to their proposal will be necessary to accommodate
the role of the complete hierarchical intonational structure in
parsing.

1.2 Focus and Discourse Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974642857143">
Another major result of our experiments was to be able to
describe the manifestations of focus in terms of the phonological
structures we discovered. We use the word focus here in the sense
of Chomsky (1971), to characterize words or phrases which are
intonationally marked as prominent. This contrasts with usage in
the Al literature, where the focus space is used to describe entities
which are assumed to be salient with respect to a given discourse
segment. However, the concepts are related to each other via the
broader concept of the attentional structure, as described in Grosz
and Sidner (1985).
Broadly speaking, intonational prominence is used to modify
the attentional state. A word or phrase that is marked by
intonational prominence is made phonetically more salient; its
prosodic coloring is more attention-demanding than it otherwise
would be. One reason for a word or phrase to receive intonational
prominence is that it refers to something which is being added to
the focus space. Or, if the entity referred to is already in the
focus space, the word or phrase may be made intonationally
prominent because the referent is under contrast or in some other
way plays a marked role in the utterance. The presence or
absence of intonational prominence is thus very much analogous
to the use of full referring expressions versus pronominal forms.
The analogy breaks down, however, when the range of possible
use is considered. Pronominal forms and other sorts of anaphora
can be used in place of full referring expressions only in some
syntactic categories and positions. Intonational prominence, by
contrast, can be absent or present on any word. Therefore, the
study of how intonational prominence is used promises to make
crucial contributions to developing a theory of attentional
structure. But an accurate controlled study of the use of
intonational prominence is impossible without an exact
characterization of the form of intonational prominence. A precise
phonological and phonetic description of intonational structure is
thus an important prerequisite to the development of theories of
discourse structure.
We also note that it is crucial to take focus, in the linguistic
sense, into account in addressing the role of intonational phrasing
in parsing. One of the main results of our experiments was the
discovery that focus systematically affects prosodic phrasing in
Japanese. Any parser intended for use with real speech must be
able to accommodate the way in which focus and syntactic
structure interact to determine the observed phrasing.

1.3 Japanese and English Intonation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991496722222222">
A final motivation for our description of Japanese was to
contribute to a more universal understanding of intonational
structure. Our work is in some sense an extension of work on an
earlier model of English intonation (Pierrehumbert, 1980, 1981;
Liberman and Pierrehumbert, 1984; Anderson, Pierrehumbert,
and Liberman, 1984). We first became interested in synthesizing
f0 contours in Japanese because there are known to be formal
differences between Japanese and English prosody. We wished to
discover what aspects of a theory developed for English prosody
would carry over to a language which differed in many ways, and
how such shared principles would interact with language-specific
principles.
1.3.1 Basic Principles — One principle that can be assumed to
be universal is the notion that intonation is separable from the
text of an utterance not just physically but also linguistically.
When a speaker produces an utterance with a give intonation
pattern, he is implementing two separate strings of phonological
elements in parallel. The textual string of distinctive segmental

<bodyText confidence="0.995630678571429">
events that is realized in the spectral patterns of the utterance is
conceptually distinct from the string of distinctive melodic events
that is realized in the f0 contour. The physical implementations
of these two representational strings are coordinated by a
phonological specification of the alignment between the textual
events (phonemic segments and phrasal groups of segments) and
the melodic events (tones and tone configurations).
1.3.2 English Tone Configurations — In English, as is well
known, there are two types of basic tone configurations. Some
tone configurations, which are called pitch accents, are placed on
especially prominent syllables in a phrase. If the placement of the
special prominences shifts because of emphasis or focus, the pitch
accents move along with them. Other tone configurations are
placed at the edges of phrases without regard for the locations of
the prominent syllables within the phrases. If the phrasing
changes, these tones must also move. For both types of tone
configuration, the speaker can select among several different
patterns. His choice appears to convey a message about
propositional attitude. For example, one pattern might suggest
that the speaker is impatiently repeating what he feels should be
obvious to the listener while another would imply that he is
uncertain about the relevance of what he is saying, as illustrated
in Figure 1.
1.3.3 Stress — Japanese phrasal prosody differs from English in
several crucial ways. First, Japanese does not have lexical stress
as English does. The prominent syllables that carry pitch accents
in English are marked also by a rhythmic salience — an extra
duration and loudness that adds another sort of prosodic

prominence to the intonational prominence of the pitch accent.
Especially prominent elements in a Japanese utterance can also be
longer and louder, but unlike in English, this rhythmic
prominence is not a lexical feature. That is, words in Japanese do
not have the lexical markings of stress that in English give a
rhythmic prominence to the first syllable in seven and the second
syllable in eleven even in the absence of a pitch accent. Instead,
Japanese has a lexical distinction between accented and
unaccented words.
1.3.4 Japanese Lexical Accent — Accented words have a
fundamental frequency fall at some designated syllable; around
the lexically designated location there is a sharp descent from a
relatively higher pitch level to a relatively lower one. We
represent this fall as a sequence of a high tone and a low tone, or
H L, as illustrated in the following schematization of the accented
word yamaza&apos;kura:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9593285">
(6) ya ma za&apos; ku ra
Fll
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909555555555">
Here the line coming up from the H indicates that the high tone is
associated to the designated syllable za&apos;. That is, the realization
of the H tone in the resulting f0 contour must occur concurrently
with the production of the syllable&apos;s segments. The relatively
lower pitch level of the L immediately following the associated H
results in the pitch fall of the accent.
Unaccented words differ from accented words in having no
syllable designated to carry the H of the accent fall, and hence no
lexically associated tone, as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.684831">
(7) mu ra sa ki i ro
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999482565217392">
Since the presence or absence of an accent HL sequence is a
property of the component lexical items, an entire sentence may
have no accents; this contrasts with the situation in English,
where it is impossible to utter a sentence without placing a pitch
accent on at least one syllable.
1.3.5 Choice of Tune and Phrasing — Another important
difference is that, utterance-internally in Japanese, there is no
paradigmatic choice among different tone patterns to express
differences in meaning such as uncertainty or impatient rejoinder.
In other words, the shape of the accent HL contour is a property
of the lexical feature accented, and there is nothing corresponding
to the choice of tone pattern for the pitch accent in English. At
the end of the phrase, however, there is a distinction between
rising and falling contours, which can convey the sort of meanings
expressed by the choice of tone patterns at the edges of phrases in
English. Because of the lexical origin of the phrase-internal tone
features in Japanese, the system of phrasal intonation is relatively
impoverished compared to English. Other than the limited choice
of pattern type at the end of the phrase, the only dimensions of
variation seem to be different choices of phrasing and of pitch
range. Our experiments were designed to explore how phrasing is
conveyed and what the consequences of local manipulations of
pitch range are.

2. THE HIERARCHY OF PHRASE LEVELS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977666666667">
In our data, we have found evidence for three levels of phrasing
marked by f0 features. We call these three types of phrases the
accentual phrase, the intermediate phrase, and the utterance.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.562445">
2.1 The Accentual Phrase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992">
The lowest level, the accentual phrase, is a phrasal unit
containing at most one accent. This unit may be a single word.
However, when words are combined into sentences, it is quite
usual for some to lose their status as separate accentual phrases.
Noun-noun compounds typically form a single accentual phrase, as
do adjective-noun sequences or sequences of direct object and
governing verb.
Apart from the possible occurrence of an accent, the hallmark
of an accentual phrase is an f0 rise at its beginning. We account
for this rise by positing a L% tone (the boundary Lffl3 marking
the phrase boundary, and a H tone (the phrasal II) associated with
a designated syllable near the beginning of the phrase. If the
sample accented and unaccented words shown above in (6) and (7)
were produced as complete accentual phrases, they might be
represented as in (8):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.506706">
(8) ya ma za&apos; ku ra mu ra sa ki i ro
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.958833">
I
(L%) H111, L% (L%) H L%
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999750739130435">
The tones that we have represented here are the only ones we
posit for the accentual phrase.&apos; We interpret f0 patterns at places
not occupied by the indicated tones as arising from a phonetic
process which interpolates between the assigned target values for
these tones.
This notion of phonetic interpolation differs radically from
more traditional representations of the accentual phrase. Studies
of Japanese in the school of modern generative phonology have
asserted that the accentual phrase is the domain of a process
called tone spreading, whereby tones are copied from their
originally specified places to associate to every syllable in the
phrase. Thus in accented phrases, the L tone of the accent is
made to associate with all syllables following the accent in the
phrase. The H tone, conversely, is made to associate with all
syllables preceding the accent, except possibly for the first, which
might be associated instead to a L tone (corresponding to the L%
that we take as marking the preceding phrase boundary). In
unaccented phrases, similarly, the phrasal H tone is thought to be
associated to all the syllables after the first. These assumptions
give rise to representations like those in (9). The phonetic
prediction of such a representation is that a spread tone will be
realized as a sustained pitch level over the syllables to which it is
copied.

<equation confidence="0.6145565">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957764705882">
Our data, however, demonstrate that Japanese actually has no
such rules of tone spreading. For example, in an utterance-medial
unaccented phrase, there is a smooth fall from the phrasal H tone
near the beginning of the phrase to the L% at the boundary
before the next accentual phrase. The slope of this fall varies
inversely with the separation of the two tones, as would be
expected if a simple linear interpolation between fixed end point
values were stretched to occupy a larger and larger distance. This
generalization is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows f0 contours
for segmentally matched unaccented sentence-medial phrases with
1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 syllables intervening between the phrasal H and
the boundary L% for the next accentual phrase. Slopes of
regression lines fit over the H-L% transition are indicated. The
inverse correlation between these slopes and the number of
syllables in the phrase is not compatible with the notion that the
phrasal H tone has spread to associate with all following syllables
up to the boundary L%. It would arise naturally, however, by a
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9703966">
3 Here we use the % notation used by Pierrehumbert (1980) to designate a
boundary tone.
4 Note that we put the first L% tone in each phrase in parentheses, because we
consider it to be an edge feature of the preceding accentual phrase rather than
of the accentual phrase being represented.

<bodyText confidence="0.999936764705882">
phonetic process which interpolates linearly between the values of
the H on the second syllable and the L%.
The finding that Japanese has no tone spreading is particularly
significant, since most modern theories of phonology assume that
surface phonological representations (those which are interpreted
phonetically) are fully specified, meaning that a specific feature
&apos;value must be assigned wherever a feature of some sort could be
assigned a value. There has been considerable controversy about
what phonological rules are necessary to generate the correct fully
specified representations. Our results show, however, that at least
for tone, the surface representations are only partially specified.
That is, only some of the syllables that could in theory be assigned
tonal values actually have associated tones. This is consistent
with a view in which the surface representations are merely
descriptions of the phonetic form, in a spirit similar to what
Marcus et al. (1983) have proposed for surface syntactic
representation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970937">
2.2 The Intermediate Phrase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97389012244898">
The partially specified tone patterns at the accentual phrase
level are grouped together prosodically into units at the next
higher level of phrasing, that of the intermediate phrase. An
intermediate phrase consists of one or more accentual phrases
(only rarely more than three). An intermediate phrase boundary
is often marked by a pause or pseudo-pause (a pre-pausal &amp;quot;winding
down&amp;quot; of production speeds unaccompanied by any actual
momentary cessation of production). Also, the L% boundary tone
for the last accentual phrase in an intermediate phrase is
markedly lower than at a medial accentual phrase boundary.
Perhaps the most salient and systematic characteristic of the
intermediate phrase, however, is that it is the domain of a process
known as catathesis. Catathesis compresses the pitch range
following an accent. This compression affects all tones up to the
intermediate phrase boundary, but it does not propagate to the
tones belonging to the following intermediate phrase.6 If an
intermediate phrase contains more than one accent, the multiple
applications of catathesis cumulate, so that the pitch range can be
extremely compressed by the end of the phrase.
An important finding of our experiments is that phrasing at
this level is a fairly reliable indicator of focus. Even in syntactic
structures where no phrase break is normally expected in neutral
renditions, focus will introduce an intermediate phrase boundary
right before the focused word or phrase. For example, in one of
our experiments, subjects consistently introduced an intermediate
phrase boundary between the words in an adjective-noun sequence
when the discourse context gave the noun a contrastive emphasis.
Often this striking use of phrasing was accompanied by local
expansion of the pitch range on the focused item, affecting the f0
values of its phrasal H, accent tones, and boundary L%. In a
sizeable number of utterances, however, the change in phrasing
was the only consequence of focus.
We suspect that this relationship between phrasing and focus
reveals something about the prominence structure internal to the
intermediate phrase. In English, the last accented item in a
phrase is generally agreed to be the strongest one. If, in Japanese,
the strongest item in a phrase is instead in first position, one
strategy for marking intonational prominence would be to
structure the phrasing of the utterance so as to place the focused
item at the beginning of an intermediate phrase. In English,
focused items are sometimes set off by phrase boundaries in this
way, but this use of phrasing is not nearly as characteristic as the
manipulation of local pitch range and of syllable duration and
amplitude to put a stronger rhythmic &amp;quot;beat&amp;quot; on the lexically
stressed syllable. We believe that this contrast between English
5. Catathesis does affect the L% at the boundary between two intermediate
phrases. This is why we consider the L% to be a property of the end of the
preceding accentual phrase rather than of the beginning of the next accentual
phrase, as shown above in representation M.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970082">
2.3 The Utterance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9856609">
Our third level of phrasing is the utterance. The phonological
mark of an utterance is that it has an initial L% boundary tone.
It is also the type of phrase which can be ended with a question
rise, a pattern which we account for by the insertion of a
boundary following the L% ending the last accentual phrase.
In our experiments, the utterance also seemed to be the
domain for two phonetic processes affecting the pitch range. One
is declination, which gradually lowers the pitch range as a
function of distance from the beginning of the utterance. Unlike
catathesis, it operates without regard to what tones are present.
The other is final towering, which further lowers the pitch range in
anticipation of the end of the utterance. Questions exhibit
declination but not final lowering. There is some reason to
suppose that they are subject to final raising, which expands the
pitch range at the end of the utterance. In particular, the H%
boundary tone ending a question is considerably higher than H
tones elsewhere in the sentence.
Final lowering is seen in English as well as in Japanese, and
was originally supposed to define a comparable utterance level
there. More recently, Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1988) have

focused item in Japanese cannot be made more prominent by
manipulating the rhythmic prominence of the stressed syllable,
because Japanese does not have stress in the sense that English
does.

proposed that final lowering is not a prosodic property specific to
a particular phonological phrase level in English, but rather is a
more direct phonetic expression of discourse structure. We now
suspect that final lowering in Japanese is similar, and in Beckman
and Pierrehumbert (forthcoming), we suggest that declination also
is such a paralinguistic discourse phenomenon. In the current
implementation of the intonation synthesizer we treat final
lowering and declination as utterance-level properties. On the
other hand, we do make the amount of lowering in each utterance
a user-controllable variable, so that it should not be difficult to
test these more recent suggestions.

2.4 Other Miscellaneous Effects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998699">
In addition to the various phrase-specific f0 features discussed
so far, there are certain other qualitative differences among tones.
For example, our experiments showed that the H tone of the
lexical accent is generally higher than the phrasal H of the
accentual phrase. We account for this difference by giving the
accent H intrinsically more tonal prominence. That is, we
automatically assign it a higher target value within the local pitch
range.
Another important effect is that when the initial syllable in the
following accentual phrase is lexically long or accented, the
preceding boundary L% is weak. That is, it undergoes a phonetic
lenition that causes the tone to be realized in the f0 contour with
only a very short duration and with a target f0 value that is
relatively higher than it otherwise would be. (As in English, low
tones are made more tonally prominent by lowering.)
Finally, the tonal prominence of a boundary L% reflects the
boundary strength; the L% boundary tone is more tonally
prominent (lower) at an intermediate phrase than at a mere
accentual phrase boundary, and still more prominent at an
utterance boundary.

3. THE FO SYNTHESIZER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994470588235">
The phrasal f0 features outlined thus far are generated
automatically by our synthesis program from a user-provided
script that identifies the locations of the appropriate phrase
boundaries and lexically determined accents in the time pattern of
speech segments for an utterance. Thus at the accentual phrase
level, the synthesizer inserts the phrasal H and boundary L% at
the appropriate places relative to the phrase ends, and assigns the
H of the accent to the designated syllable along with the accent L
at the appropriate time delay. At the intermediate phrase level,
the program triggers a compression of the pitch range at each
accent, lowering the values of all subsequent tones until the end of
the phrase. And at the utterance level, it sequentially lowers the
f0 values of the tones to generate the rule-prescribed time courses
of declination and final lowering. The techniques used to
implement these effects are quite similar to those used in the
English synthesizer developed earlier by Anderson, Pierrehumbert,
and Liberman (1984), and are applied in the same order.

3.1 The Schematized M Contour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977355625">
First, the input routines parse the user-provided script, filling
in system defaults for unspecified values to produce a set of values
for speaker variables and phrasal structures. Once the the script
has been interpreted, the next step is to construct a schematic
version of the 93 contour in which tones appear as level stretches.
The values that must be computed in constructing the schematic
are the temporal location of each stretch and its duration and f0
value.
3.1.1 Timing — The location and duration of each tone is
determined by the time pattern of the speech segments, and by
our theory of the rules which align tones with segments. For
example, the stretch for a medial L% begins at the end of the last
segment before the relevant phrasal boundary. The difference in
timing between a weak L% and a strong L% (see Section 2.4) is
accomplished by giving a weak L% only a point duration and a
strong L% the &amp;quot;standard tone duration&amp;quot; (a speaker- and rate-
specific value roughly the length of a short syllable). The
beginning of the following phrasal H can then be located
immediately after the end of the L%.
In the present version of the synthesizer, the &amp;quot;standard tone
duration&amp;quot; is the only possible duration for a tone that is not a
point. The user can specify its actual millisecond value in his
script for the utterance, or he can include it in a file of user-
defined defaults for the speaker, or, if the system-provided default
is appropriate for the speaker and rate, he can leave the value
unspecified.° The locations and types of the various phrase
boundaries and the location of the accent, on the other hand, are
specific to an utterance, and must be specified by the user in the
utterance script.
3.1.2 Rules for the ID Value — The f0 value of each tone is
determined by the interaction of relationships such as the
following:
High versus Low: A low tone is lower than a high tone in the
same local pitch range setting.
Intrinsic prominence of accents: The H in an accent is higher
than the phrasal H tone.
Boundary tone weakening: The L% boundary tone is higher if
the first syllable of the upcoming phrase is long or accented.
Boundary strength: The L% boundary tone is lower at an
intermediate phrase boundary than at an accentual phrase
boundary, and lower yet at an utterance boundary.
In the synthesizer, all of these qualitative differences have been
made precise, with numerical values for the various relations
estimated from the results of our experiments. Obviously, several
rules interact to control the value for any single tone. For
instance, a boundary tone might be raised because the following
phrase begins with a long syllable, but lowered because it is at an
intermediate phrase boundary.

3.1.3 The Tone-Scaling Domain — The tone-scaling domain
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979016">
within which these rules operate is a normalized transformed hertz
domain, which reflects the overall choice of pitch range and the
intonational prominence of each accentual phrase. The lower
bound of the tone-scaling domain is defined by a reference line (r),
which is set to the lowest value in the speaker&apos;s range. The upper
bound of the overall pitch range is a high-tone line for the
intermediate phrase (h), which is set to the highest possible H tone
value in that phrase. The size of the overall pitch range is thus
h— r. By raising h, this overall pitch range is expanded for
&amp;quot;speaking up&amp;quot; (as it would be in natural speech if the speaker is
excited or projecting his voice).
Various uses of this tone-scaling domain are illustrated in
Figure 3. For example, catathesis is realized as a proportional
compression of the overall pitch range that reduces the value of h
at each accent according to the formula:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.424752">
(10) hnetv * (hold- r) r [c &lt;1]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970545">
Note that in this equation the proportional reduction of h is
normalized to the overall pitch range, so that it can be expressed
as a constant value c.
The prominences of different accentual phrases relative to the
strongest element in the intermediate phrase are also normalized
to this overall pitch range, so as to be readily interpretable and
easily specified by the user. A local tone-scaling domain is
calculated for each accentual phrase on the basis of its relative
prominence. (This can be thought of as setting a local accentual-
phrase value for the high-tone line ha, as illustrated in Figure 3.)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9351785">
6. These three options are available also for other underived variables such as the
position relative to the end of the utterance where final lowering should begin.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.995994">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996569470588235">
The relations among tones described above are then similarly
expressed as prominence values normalized to this local tone-
scaling domain. In this way the relationships can be expressed as
speaker-specific constants despite changes in overall pitch range
and local focus, and interactions among them can be
multiplicative within the tone-scaling domain. Within the local
tone-scaling domain, H tones are scaled upward and L tones are
scaled downwards. That is, prominence values for H tones
increase from 0 to 1 as f0 goes up from r to h, whereas those for L
tones decrease from 1 to 0, as indicated by the different
prominence scales to the right of the transformed hertz domain in
Figure 3.
Our use of this transformed hertz domain follows broadly the
conceptual structure for English tonal scaling developed in
Liberman and Pierrehumbert (1984). Differences between the two
models appear to reflect differences between Japanese and
English. For example, many English L tones appear below the
reference line whereas Japanese L tones are all realized above it, in
the same overall region as H tones.
Of the various quantitative values used in tone scaling, those
of the reference line, of the high-tone line, of the catathesis ratio
constant, and of the other constants for the relations among tones
are all speaker variables like the &amp;quot;standard tone duration&amp;quot; for
timing. Therefore, they are implemented in the synthesizer as
variables that can be specified in the utterance script or in a
separately provided defaults file, and which revert to the system
default value if left unspecified by the user. The prominence

3.2 The Finished f0 Contour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999888">
When the tones have been located in time and frequency,
several adjustments are made to produce a finished natural
intonation contour from the schematized f0 contour. First, the
tones are connected by linear interpolation, as shown in Figure 4a.
Declination now applies, as well as final lowering in declaratives
(Figure 4b). The resulting contour is then smoothed by
convolution with a square window of roughly syllable width.7 Step
functions in f0 now appear more realistically as gradual rises
(Figure 4c). Finally, a small amount of random jitter is added to
prevent the occurrence of unnaturally flat sections and
unnaturally smooth ramps, and the f0 value is set to zero during
portions corresponding to voiceless segments (Figure 4d). In order
to listen to the results, the computed f0 contour is then
substituted for the natural contour in an LPC-coded version of
the utterance, and the speech is resynthesized.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983647058823">
The model of Japanese intonation implemented in the
synthesis program accounts for all of the characteristics of
Japanese intonational structure that we have been able to
document in our experiments. Some future modifications to the
model will probably be necessary as we learn more about how the
highest level of phrasing behaves in long connected passages. For
example, as noted above, we suspect on the basis of recent work
on English (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986) that some of the
characteristics that we have identified with the utterance in the
present model are actually reflections of discourse structure rather
than features specific to a well-defined type of unit within the
hierarchy of prosodic phrases.
Constructing the f0 synthesizer has been useful in confirming
our phonological and phonetic model of Japanese intonation. We
believe that the synthesizer will also be useful in generating
controlled materials for investigating the use of intonational
prominence and the role of phrasing in parsing speech.

catathesis. A sudden compression of pitch range that is
triggered by a particular tonal configuration, and that lowers
all tones following the trigger within some phrasal unit. In
Japanese, catathesis is triggered by every accent, and in
English, by every bitonal pitch accent.
declination. A gradual lowering of the pitch range that is
effected as some function of time from the beginning of an
utterance without regard to the tonal structure.
final lowering. A gradual lowering of the pitch range starting at
some distance from the end of the utterance.
fundamental frequency. The reciprocal of the period in a
periodic signal, and the main physical correlate of pitch.
Fundamental frequency is abbreviated JO and is measured in
periods per second (unit hertz). In speech, f0 corresponds to
the frequency of vibration of the vocal cords during voiced
segments.

least squares estimation of successive samples within an
analysis frame from the linear combination of the last n
samples. The set of predictor coefficients for each analysis
frame can then be used as a filter for an input pulse train to
synthesize a new signal with the same spectral pattern and an
arbitrarily different 10 pattern.
pitch accent. A tonal configuration that is associated to a
designated syllable in an utterance, and that marks the
syllable (or the word containing the syllable) as accented or
intonationally prominent. In Japanese, accent consists of a
pitch fall from H tone to L at a lexically designated syllable in
a word. In English, an accent is any one of six tonal patterns
(H*, L*, H*+L, L*+H, H+L*, L+H*) that can be associated to
a lexically designated syllable.
pitch range. The spread of fundamental frequency between the
&amp;quot;floor&amp;quot; of a speaker&apos;s voice and the highest f0 appropriate to
the occasion. Linguistic factors such as prominence or
intonational focus (see Section 1.2) can locally affect pitch
range, but it is determined overall by paralinguistic factors
such as degree of animation and projection; the overall pitch
range is raised or expanded when the speaker &amp;quot;speaks up&amp;quot; to
project his voice, or when he is excited.
prosody. The rhythm and melody of speech as specified
phonologically in the representation of its phrasal organization
and intonational structure, and as realized phonetically in
duration and loudness and pitch patterns.
reference line. In Japanese tone-scaling, the bottom of the pitch
range, corresponding to the lowest possible 10 value for a tone
in a speaker&apos;s pitch range.
standard Japanese. The speech of educated Tokyo speakers, as
prescribed by the Japanese Broadcasting Corporation.
stress. A local non-tonal prominence on a lexically designated
syllable in an English word, which is realized phonetically in
the rhythmic pattern of relative lengths and loudnesses, and
also by certain segmental patterns such as vowel and
consonant lenition.
tone. The basic phonological element representing distinctive
events in the melody — i.e., the melodic counterpart of a
phonemic segment in the text string. We believe that these
melodic segments are target pitch level specifications such as
&amp;quot;high&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; rather than specifications of pitch change
such as &amp;quot;rise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot;. (See Pierrehumbert and Beckman
(forthcoming) for detailed arguments on this point.) In both
English and Japanese, there are two tone types — H and L —
and the type of each tone in an utterance, and its temporal
location and 1.0 value reflect the prosodic phrasing and
intonational focus structure of the utterance.

INTRODUCTION In this paper, we will present a computer program for synthesizing fundamental frequency contours for standard Japanese. Fundamental frequency (M) is the paramount physical correlate of the sensation of pitch, and, in many languages, the time course of f0 is one of the primary phonetic manifestations of intonation. This is especially true in Japanese, where duration and amplitude do not have the consequential role in communicating intonational structure that they do in English (Beckman, 1986). Accordingly, a program for synthesizing Japanese f0 contours is tantamount to a computational implementation of a theory of Japanese intonation. The theory that we have implemented in our synthesis program is based on a review of the literature in English and Japanese, and on the results of an extensive series of experiments in which we examined and made f0 measurements of about 2500 intonation contours in order to resolve some of the many problems not answered in the literature. These experiments have uncovered important facts about the hierarchical structure underlying Japanese prosody and</context>

We use the word focus here in the sense of Chomsky (1971), to characterize words or phrases which are intonationally marked as prominent.

However, the concepts are related to each other via the broader concept of the attentional structure, as described in Grosz and Sidner (1985).

A word or phrase that is marked by intonational prominence is made phonetically more salient; its prosodic coloring is more attention-demanding than it otherwise would be. One reason for a word or phrase to receive intonational prominence is that it refers to something which is being added to the focus space. Or, if the entity referred to is already in the focus space, the word or phrase may be made intonationally prominent because the referent is under contrast or in some other way plays a marked role in the </context>

CONCLUSION The model of Japanese intonation implemented in the synthesis program accounts for all of the characteristics of Japanese intonational structure that we have been able to document in our experiments. Some future modifications to the model will probably be necessary as we learn more about how the highest level of phrasing behaves in long connected passages. For example, as noted above, we suspect on the basis of recent work on English (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986) that some of the characteristics that we have identified with the utterance in the present model are actually reflections of discourse structure rather than features specific to a well-defined type of unit within the hierarchy of prosodic phrases. Constructing the f0 synthesizer has been useful in confirming our phonological and phonetic model of Japanese intonation. We believe that the synthesizer will also be useful in generating controlled materials for investigating the use of intonational prominence and the role of phrasing in parsing speech.

One of the main results of our experiments was the discovery that focus systematically affects prosodic phrasing in Japanese. Any parser intended for use with real speech must be able to accommodate the way in which focus and syntactic structure interact to determine the observed phrasing. 1.3 Japanese and English Intonation A final motivation for our description of Japanese was to contribute to a more universal understanding of intonational structure. Our work is in some sense an extension of work on an earlier model of English intonation (Pierrehumbert, 1980, 1981; Liberman and Pierrehumbert, 1984; Anderson, Pierrehumbert, and Liberman, 1984). We first became interested in synthesizing f0 contours in Japanese because there are known to be formal differences between Japanese and English prosody. We wished to discover what aspects of a theory developed for English prosody would carry over to a language which differed in many ways, and how such shared principles would interact with language-specific principles. 1.3.1 Basic Principles — One principle that can be assumed to be universal is the notion that intonation is separable from the text of an utterance not just physically but also lin</context>

Within the local tone-scaling domain, H tones are scaled upward and L tones are scaled downwards. That is, prominence values for H tones increase from 0 to 1 as f0 goes up from r to h, whereas those for L tones decrease from 1 to 0, as indicated by the different prominence scales to the right of the transformed hertz domain in Figure 3. Our use of this transformed hertz domain follows broadly the conceptual structure for English tonal scaling developed in Liberman and Pierrehumbert (1984). Differences between the two models appear to reflect differences between Japanese and English. For example, many English L tones appear below the reference line whereas Japanese L tones are all realized above it, in the same overall region as H tones. Of the various quantitative values used in tone scaling, those of the reference line, of the high-tone line, of the catathesis ratio constant, and of the other constants for the relations among tones are all speaker variables like the &amp;quot;standard tone duration&amp;quot; for timing. Therefore, they are implemented in the synthesizer as variables that can b</context>

There has been considerable controversy about what phonological rules are necessary to generate the correct fully specified representations. Our results show, however, that at least for tone, the surface representations are only partially specified. That is, only some of the syllables that could in theory be assigned tonal values actually have associated tones. This is consistent with a view in which the surface representations are merely descriptions of the phonetic form, in a spirit similar to what Marcus et al. (1983) have proposed for surface syntactic representation. 2.2 The Intermediate Phrase The partially specified tone patterns at the accentual phrase level are grouped together prosodically into units at the next higher level of phrasing, that of the intermediate phrase. An intermediate phrase consists of one or more accentual phrases (only rarely more than three). An intermediate phrase boundary is often marked by a pause or pseudo-pause (a pre-pausal &amp;quot;winding down&amp;quot; of production speeds unaccompanied by any actual momentary cessation of production). Also, the L% boundary tone for the last accentual </context>

And the most substantial current proposal about the role of intonational phrasing in the parsing of Japanese (Marcus and Hindle, 1985) takes into account only a single level of phrasing. In actuality, however, Japanese and English both have several different types of intonational phrase, which are related to each other hierarchically.2 As Marcus and Hindle point out to us, major modifications to their proposal will be necessary to accommodate the role of the complete hierarchical intonational structure in parsing. 173 1.2 Focus and Discourse Structure Another major result of our experiments was to be able to describe the manifestations of focus in terms of the phonological structures we discovered.
