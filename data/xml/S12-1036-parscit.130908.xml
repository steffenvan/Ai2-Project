<bodyText confidence="0.999981533333333">
This paper describes our participation in the
closed track of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task
of finding the scope of negation. To perform
the task, we propose a system that has three
components: negation cue detection, scope of
negation detection, and negated event detec-
tion. In the first phase, the system creates a
lexicon of negation signals from the training
data and uses the lexicon to identify the nega-
tion cues. Then, it applies machine learning
approaches to detect the scope and negated
event for each negation cue identified in the
first phase. Using a preliminary approach, our
system achieves a reasonably good accuracy
in identifying the scope of negation.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925371428571">
All human language samples, either written or spo-
ken, contain some information in negated form. In
tasks such as information retrieval, sometimes, we
should consider only the positive information of an
event and disregard its negation information, and
vice versa. For example, while searching for the pa-
tients with diabetes, we should not include a patient
who has a clinical report saying No symptoms of di-
abetes were observed. Thus, finding the negation
and its scope is important in tasks where the nega-
tion and assertion information need to be treated dif-
ferently. However, most of the systems developed
for processing natural language data do not consider
negations present in the sentences. Although various
works (Morante et al., 2008; Morante and Daele-
mans, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Councill et al., 2010;
Apostolova et al., 2011) have dealt with the identifi-
cation of negations and their scope in sentences, this
is still a challenging task.
The first task in *SEM 2012 Shared
Task (Morante and Blanco, 2012) is concerned
with finding the scope of negation. The task
includes identifying: i) negation cues, ii) scope of
negation, and iii) negated event for each negation
present in the sentences. Negation cue is a word,
part of a word, or a combination of words that
carries the negation information. Scope of negation
in a sentence is the longest group of words in
the sentence that is influenced by the negation
cue. Negated event is the shortest group of words
that is actually affected by the negation cue. In
Example (1) below, word no is a negation cue, the
discontinuous word sequences ‘I gave him’ and
‘sign of my occupation’ are the scopes, and ‘gave’
is the negated event.

In this paper, we propose a system to detect the
scope of negation for the closed track of *SEM 2012
Shared Task. Our system uses a combination of
a rule based approach, and a machine learning ap-
proach. We use a rule based approach to create a
lexicon of all the negation words present in the train-
ing data. Then we use this lexicon to detect the
negation cues present in the test data. We do a pre-
liminary analysis of finding the scope of negation
and the negated events by applying a machine learn-
ing approach, and using basic features created from
the words, lemmas, and parts-of-speech (POS) tags
of words in the sentences. The F-measure scores

cue detection, 65% in full scope identification, 48%
in negated event detection, and 39% in identifying
full negation. Our error analysis shows that the use
of lexicon is not very appropriate to detect the nega-
tion cues. We also describe the challenges in identi-
fying the scope and the negated events.

2 Problem Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999710727272727">
The *SEM 2012 shared task competition provided
three data sets: training, development, and test data
set. Each sentence in each data set is split into
words. The dataset contains the information such
as lemma, part of speech, and other syntactic infor-
mation of each word. Each sentence of training and
development data is annotated with negation cues,
scopes and negated events. Using the training and
the development data, the task is to identify negation
cues, scopes and negated events in all unannotated
sentences of the test data.

A sentence can contain more than one negation
cue. Negation cues in the data set can be i) a sin-
gle word token such as n&apos;t, nowhere, ii) a contin-
uous sequence of two or more words, such as no
more, by no means or iii) two or more discontinu-
ous words such as ..neither...nor... A negation cue
is either a part or same as its corresponding nega-
tion word. This corresponding negation word is re-
ferred as a negation signal in the remaining sections
of the paper. For example, for a negation signal
unnecessary, the negation cue is un, and similarly,
for a negation signal needless, the negation cue is
less.
Scope of a negation in a sentence can be a con-
tinuous sequence of words or a discontinuous set
of words in the sentence. Scope of negation some-
times includes the negation word. A negation word
may not have a negated event. Presence of a negated
event in a sentence depends upon the facts described
by the sentence. Non-factual sentences such as in-
terrogative, imperative, and conditional do not con-
tain negated events. Morante and Daelemans (2012)
describe the details of the negation cue, scope, and
negated event, and the annotation guidelines. An ex-
ample of the task is shown in Table 1.

3 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993935">
We decompose the system to identify the scope of
negation into three tasks. They are:
</bodyText>

1. Finding the negation cue
2. Finding the scope of negation
3. Finding the negated event
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929380952381">
The scope detection and the negated event de-
tection tasks are dependent on the task of finding
the negation cue. But the scope detection and the
negated event detection tasks are independent of
each other.
We identify the negation cues present in the test
data based on a lexicon of negation signals that
are present in the training and the development
data. The tasks of identifying scope of negation and
negated event are modeled as classification prob-
lems. To identify scope and negated event, we train
classifiers with the instances created from the train-
ing data provided. We create test instances from the
test data annotated with negation cues predicted by
our cue detection component. Due to the use of test
data annotated by our cue detection component, the
false negative rate in predicting the negation cues is
propagated to the scope detection as well as negated
event detection components. The details of all the
three components are described in the subsections
below.

In the training and development data, multiword
negation cues account for only 1.40% of the total
negation cues. At this stage, we decided to focus
on identifying the single word negation cues. The
system first creates a lexicon that contains the pairs
of negation cues and their corresponding negation
signals for all the single word negation cues present
in the training and the development datasets. In or-
der to identify a negation cue in the test set, the sys-
tem searches all the words in the sentences of the
test data that match the negation signals of the lexi-
con. For each word that matches, it assigns the cor-
responding cue of the signal from the lexicon as its
negation cue.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999552">
3.2 Identifying the scope of negation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955346153846">
We apply a machine learning technique to identify
the scope of negation. For each negation cue present
in a sentence, we create the problem instances as the
tuple of the negation signal and each word present
in the same sentence. To create the instances, we
use only those sentences having at least one nega-
tion. For training, we create instances from the train-
ing data, but we consider only those words that are
within a window of size 20 from the negation signal
and within the sentence boundary. We restricted the
words to be within the window in order to minimize
the problem of imbalanced data. This window was
chosen following our observation that only 1.26%
of the scope tokens go beyond the 20 word win-
dow from the negation signal. Including the words
beyond this window causes a major increase in the
negative instances resulting in a highly imbalanced
training set. While creating test instances, we do not
restrict the words by window size. This restriction is
not done in order to include all the words of the sen-
tences in the test instances. An instance is labeled
as positive if the word used to create the instance is
the scope of the negation signal; else it is labeled as
negative.
We extract 10 features to identify the scope of
negation as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9971975">
1. Negation signal in the tuple
2. Lemma of the negation signal
3. POS tag of the negation signal
4. Word in the tuple
5. Lemma of the word in the tuple
6. POS tag of the word in the tuple
7. Distance between the negation signal and the
word in terms of number of words
8. Position of the word from the negation signal
(left, right)
9. Whether a punctuation character (‘,’, ‘:’,‘;’) ex-
ists between the word and the negation signal
10. Sequence of POS tags in between the negation
signal and the word
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999196818181818">
After the classification, if an instance is predicted
as positive, the word used to create the instance is
considered as the scope of the negation signal. If a
negation signal has prefix such as ‘dis’, ‘un’, ‘in’,
‘ir’, or ‘im’, the scope of negation includes only the
part of word (signal) excluding the prefix. Thus, for
each negation signal having these prefix, we remove
the prefix from the signal and consider the remain-
ing part of it as the scope, regardless of whether the
classifier classifies the instance pair as positive or
negative.

3.3 Identifying the negated event
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999305">
The task of identifying the negated event is simi-
lar to the task of identifying the scope of negation.
The process of creating the instances for this task
is almost the same to that of finding the scope of
negation, except that, we limit the window size to
4 words from the negation signal. 4.24% of the
negated events lie away from the 4 word window.
Beyond this window, the events are very sparse and
a small increment in the window size leads to abrupt
increase in negative instances and creates an imbal-
ance in the data. The 4 word window size was se-
lected based on the best result obtained among var-
ious experiments performed with different window
sizes greater than and equal to 4. The same rule
applies while creating instances for training data as
well as test data. We use only nine features in this
step, excluding the 9th feature used in the scope de-
tection. We also apply the same rule of mapping the
negation signals starting with ‘dis’, ‘un’, ‘in’, ‘ir’,
and ‘im’ to the negated event as in the previous step.

4 Experimental Settings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998675692307692">
We evaluated our system only on the test data of the
shared task. For the machine learning tasks, we used
the SVM light classifier (Joachims, 1999) with 4th
degree polynomial kernel and other default param-
eters. The identification of cues, scopes, negated
events, and full negation are evaluated on the basis
of the F-measures. We also use ‘B’ variant for cues,
scopes, negated events and the full negation for eval-
uation. The precision of ‘B’ variant is calculated as
the ratio of true positives to the system count. Iden-
tification of cues and negated events are measured
independent of any other steps. But the identifica-
tion of the scopes is measured depending upon the
correct identification of cues in three different ways
as follows:
i) scopes (cue match): the cue has to be correct
for the scope to be correct
ii) scopes (no cue match): the system must iden-
tify part of the cue for the scope to be correct
iii) scope tokens (no cue match): a part of the sys-
tem identified cue must overlap with the gold stan-
dard cue for the scope tokens to be correct
The F1 score of the full negation detection was
used to rank the systems of the participants. The
details about the evaluation measures can be found
in Morante and Blanco (2012).

5 Results Analysis

The results obtained by our system over the test data
are shown in Table 3. The results obtained by each
component, and their analysis are described in the
subsections below.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994577">
5.1 Identifying the negation cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939074074074">
The system is able to achieve an 85.77% F1 score in
the task of identifying the negation cues using a sim-
ple approach based on the lexicon of the negation
signals. Because of the system’s inability to iden-
tify multiword negation cues, it could not detect the
multiword cues such as ..neither..nor.., ..absolutely
nothing.., ..far from.., ..never more.., that account for
3.5% of the total negation cues present in the test
data.
The accuracy of the system is limited by the cov-
erage of the lexicon. Due to the low coverage of the
lexicon, the system fails to identify signals such as
ceaseless, discoloured, incredulity, senseless,
and unframed that are present only in the test data.
These signals account for 4.5% of the total negation
signals present in the test data. Some words such
as never, nothing, not, n&apos;t, no, and without are
mostly present as the negation signals in the data.
But these words are not always the negation signals.
The phrase no doubt is present nine times in the test
data, but the word no is a negation signal in only
four of them. This accounts for 1.89% error in the
negation cue detection. The word save is present
once as a negation signal in the training data, but it
is never a negation signal in the test data. Therefore,
our lexicon based system invariably predicts two oc-
currences of save in the test data as negation signals.

earlier, the negation cues identified in the first task
are used to identify the scope of negation and the
negated events. Using the test data with 15% error
in negation cues as the input to this component and
some of the wrong predictions of the scope by this
component led to a low recall value in the scope de-
tection.
The results show that the system works well when
a negation signal has fewer scope tokens and when
the scope tokens are closer to the negation signal.
There are some cases where the system could not
identify the scope tokens properly. It is unable to de-
tect the scope tokens that are farther in distance from
the negation signals. The system is not performing
well in predicting the discontinuous scopes. When
a negation cue has discontinuous scope, mostly the
system predicts one sequence of words correctly but
could not identify the next sequence. In sentence
(2) in the example below, the underlined word se-
quences are the discontinuous scopes of the nega-
tion cue not. In the sentence, our system predicts
only the second sequence of scope, but not the first
sequence. In some cases, our system does not have a
good coverage of scope tokens. In sentence (3), the
underlined word sequence is the scope of the signal
no, but our system detects only at ninety was hard-
ship as its scope. These inabilities to detect the full
scope have led to have a higher accuracy in predict-
ing the partial scope tokens (76.23%) than predicting
the full scope (64.76%).

Analyzing the results, we see that the error in pre-
dicting the scope of the negation is high when the
scope is distributed in two different phrases. In the
example (2) above, does not help us in any way is
a single verb phrase and all the scope within the
phrase is correctly identified by our system. The
box being a separate phrase, it is unable to identify
it. However, in some cases such as example (4), the
system could not identify any scope tokens for nega-
tion cue not.
Some of the findings of previous works have
shown that the features related to syntactic path are
helpful in identifying the scope of negation. Li et
al. (2010) used the syntactic path from the word to
the negation signal and showed that this helped to
improve the accuracy of scope detection. Similarly,
work by Councill et al. (2010) showed that the ac-
curacy of scope detection could be increased using
the features from the dependency parse tree. In our
experiment, there was a good improvement in the
scope detection rate when we included “sequence
of POS tags” between the negation signal and the
word as a feature. This improvement after including
the sequence of POS tags feature and its consistency

lated features might help to improve the accuracy in
scope detection.

We are able to achieve an F1 score of 48.33% in pre-
dicting the negated events, which is the lowest score
among all three components. As in the scope de-
tection task, error in negation cue detection led to
lower the recall rate of the negated event detection
system. The accuracy of full negation is based on
the correct identification of the negation cues, scope
and the negated events of all the negations present
in the sentences. The output shows that there are
many cases where negation cues and the scope are
correctly identified but there is an error in identify-
ing the negated events. The higher error in predict-
ing the negated events led to reduce the score of full
negation and achieve an F1 score of 39.04%.
Our system is unable to detect some negated
events even though they are adjacent to the nega-
tion signal. This shows that the use of simple fea-
tures extracted from words, lemmas, and POS tags
is not enough to predict the negated events properly.
Adding features related to words in left and right of
the negation signal and the path feature may help to
improve the detection of negated events.
In order to analyze the impact of error in the nega-
tion cue detection component upon the scope and
negated event detection components, we performed
an experiment using the gold standard negation cues
to detect the scope and the negated events. F1 scores
achieved by this system are 73.1% in full scope de-
tection, 54.87% in negated event detection, 81.46%
in scope tokens detection, and 49.57% in full nega-
tion detection. The result shows that there is al-
most 10% increment in the F1 score in all the com-
ponents. Thus, having an improved cue detection
component greatly helps to improve the accuracy of
scope and negated event detection components.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999715">
In this paper we outline a combination of a rule
based approach and a machine learning approach to
identify the negation cue, scope of negation, and the
negated event. We show that applying a basic ap-
proach of using a lexicon to predict the negation cues
achieves a considerable accuracy. However, our sys-
tem is unable to identify the negation cues such as
never, not, nothing, n’t, and save that can appear
as a negation signal as well as in other non-negated
contexts. It also cannot cover the negation cues of
the signals that are not present in the training data.
Moreover, in order to improve the overall accuracy
of the scope and negated event detection, we need an
accurate system to detect the negation cues since the
error in the negation cue detection propagates to the
next steps of identifying the scope and the negated
event. It is difficult to identify the scope of nega-
tions that are farther in distance from the negation
signal. Detecting the tokens of the scope that are
discontinuous is also challenging.
As future work, we would like to extend our task
to use a machine learning approach instead of the
lexicon of negation signals to better predict the nega-
tion cues. The system we presented here uses a pre-
liminary approach without including any syntactic
information to detect the scope and negated events.
We would also incorporate syntactic information to
identify the scope and negated events in our future
work. To improve the accuracy of identifying the
scope and the negated events, adding other features
related to the neighbor words of the negation signal
might be helpful. In our tasks, we limit the scope
and negated event instances by the window size in
order to avoid imbalance data problem. Another in-
teresting work to achieve better accuracy could be to
use other approaches of imbalanced dataset classifi-
cation instead of limiting the training instances by
the window size.

<abstract confidence="0.9991973125">This paper describes our participation in the closed track of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task of finding the scope of negation. To perform the task, we propose a system that has three components: negation cue detection, scope of negation detection, and negated event detection. In the first phase, the system creates a lexicon of negation signals from the training data and uses the lexicon to identify the negation cues. Then, it applies machine learning approaches to detect the scope and negated event for each negation cue identified in the first phase. Using a preliminary approach, our system achieves a reasonably good accuracy in identifying the scope of negation.</abstract>

We also apply the same rule of mapping the negation signals starting with ‘dis’, ‘un’, ‘in’, ‘ir’, and ‘im’ to the negated event as in the previous step. 4 Experimental Settings We evaluated our system only on the test data of the shared task. For the machine learning tasks, we used the SVM light classifier (Joachims, 1999) with 4th degree polynomial kernel and other default parameters. The identification of cues, scopes, negated events, and full negation are evaluated on the basis of the F-measures. We also use ‘B’ variant for cues, scopes, negated events and the full negation for evaluation. The precision of ‘B’ variant is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the system count. Identification of cues and negated events are measured independent of any other steps. But the identification of the scopes is measured depending upon the correct identification of cues in three different ways as follows: i) scop</context>

For example, for a negation signal unnecessary, the negation cue is un, and similarly, for a negation signal needless, the negation cue is less. Scope of a negation in a sentence can be a continuous sequence of words or a discontinuous set of words in the sentence. Scope of negation sometimes includes the negation word. A negation word may not have a negated event. Presence of a negated event in a sentence depends upon the facts described by the sentence. Non-factual sentences such as interrogative, imperative, and conditional do not contain negated events. Morante and Daelemans (2012) describe the details of the negation cue, scope, and negated event, and the annotation guidelines. An example of the task is shown in Table 1. 3 System Description We decompose the system to identify the scope of negation into three tasks. They are: 1. Finding the negation cue 2.
