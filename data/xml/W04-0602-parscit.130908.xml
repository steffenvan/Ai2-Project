Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999928958333333">
Within two European projects metadata
interoperability is one of the central top-
ics. While the INTERA project has as
one of its goals to achieve an interopera-
bility between two widely used metadata
sets for the domain of language re-
sources, the ECHO project created an in-
tegrated metadata domain of in total nine
data providers from five different disci-
plines from the humanities. In both pro-
jects ad hoc techniques are used to
achieve results. In the INTERA project,
however, machine readable and ISO
compliant concept definitions are created
as a first step towards the Semantic Web.
In the ECHO project a complex ontology
was realized purely relying on XML. It is
argued that concept definitions should be
registered in open Data Category Reposi-
tories and that relations between them
should be described as RDF assertions.
Yet we are missing standards that would
allow us to overcome the ad hoc solu-
tions.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998566">
Metadata is a key source of information towards
realization of the Semantic Web that could be
exploited in many different ways. Several pro-
jects are starting to focus on exploiting rich
metadata in and between projects and disciplines.
For instance, the ECHO (European Cultural
Heritage Online)1 project brings together meta-
data for resources from the History of Arts, His-
tory of Science, Linguistics, Ethnology and
Philosophy. One aspect of the work in ECHO is
to create a cross-disciplinary domain for resource
discovery. In the INTERA (Integrated European
Language Resource Area)2 project one of the

tasks is to establish a foundation for a more
flexible definition and use of metadata for lan-
guage resources.
We can distinguish two types of metadata. The
first one concerns its use as “data about data”.
This definition of metadata includes for example
text that describes images, sounds, videos and
other texts. Such metadata can exist in different
forms like complex annotations of media re-
cordings as discussed for example by Bird (2001)
and Brugman (2001). A second type of metadata
consists of keywords describing objects that form
the catalogues of the increasingly large digital
collections, e.g., of linguistic data. This type of
metadata was introduced by initiatives such as
Dublin Core3 for general type web-resources,
OLAC4 for general type linguistic resources and
IMDI5 for more elaborate linguistic resource de-
scriptions that are useful not only for discovery
but also for management purposes.
Although the first type of metadata is very im-
portant for the above mentioned use in content
descriptions, in this paper we will focus on as-
pects that are related to the second, keyword type
of metadata. It is obvious that this type of meta-
data

from its content;

management of multimedia resources since
speech and image recognition are still far
away from being applicable in most cases;
• includes a reduced set of descriptive ele-
ments and requires classification such that
content information in many cases is richer;
• offers a limited set of semantically well-
defined data categories (ISO 12620) that can
be related with other concepts.

were chosen to solve the tasks and the solutions
we are aiming at in the long run. In this context

2 Current tasks
The INTERA task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829121951219">
One focus of the work in the INTERA project is
on the integration of metadata elements that are
used in describing language resources for open
data category repositories. Two metadata sets are
being used currently for the discovery and man-
agement of language resources. The OLAC set is
used for discovery purposes and aims to be used
for all kinds of language resources. The set was
derived from the Dublin Core set, i.e., on pur-
pose it only includes a limited set of elements.
The IMDI set was designed bottom-up and is
used for discovery and management purposes. It
is a rich and structured set especially derived for
annotated resources and lexica. The distributed
IMDI domain was extended in the INTERA and
ECHO projects to more than 27 participating
European institutions sees itself as an OLAC data
provider, i.e., the OLAC harvester can read all
IMDI records that are offered via the Open Ar-
chives Initiative metadata harvesting protocol7
(OAI MHP). A wrapper is used to map the IMDI
elements to the OLAC elements, i.e., the map-
ping relations are hardwired into a server-based
program.
Recently, a new version of the IMDI metadata
set (version 3.0.3) was provided. In parallel, also
the new version of the OLAC metadata set (Au-
gust 2003) was worked out. Both metadata sets
are described by human readable definition docu-
ments available in the web. New mapping rules
have to be constructed which for short-term
needs will again be hard-wired into a server-
based program.
But this is not seen as being sufficient to serve
future needs. New ways have to be developed for
making the mapping more transparent and to pre-
pare the metadata domain for Semantic Web ap-
plications. Therefore, as a first step, the IMDI
metadata concepts are entered into the open data
category registry that is currently emerging
within ISO TC37/SC4.

In the ECHO project one of the tasks is to create
a metadata domain that covers five disciplines
and several institutions within each discipline. In
total we were confronted with nine different
metadata sets.
The table below gives an overview of the meta-
data types that we were confronted with. One of
the sets is DC compliant, two produce descrip-
tions that are close to DC, two provide true OAI
compliance including the delivery of DC records.
Most of the data is extracted from relational da-
tabases, encoding other types of data as well. In

Also the way in which the content of resources is
described differs substantially. In Fotothek the
IconClass thesaurus is used to categorize the con-
tent of photos and images. In the RMV catalogue
the OVM thesaurus is used which is similar to
the AAT thesaurus. Some use the subject field
from the DC element set with all its weaknesses,
others have an unconstrained keyword field and
the elaborate IMDI set has a couple of elements
that describe the content such as “task”, “genre”,
“subgenre”, “language” and “modalities”.
A variety of description options is used for the
indication of geographic regions. In the RMV
case a geographic thesaurus is used. Others use
descriptors such as “country” and “region”. In
some instances language names have to be used
to indicate a geographical overlap.
When creating an interoperable metadata domain
one has to cope with problems at each layer:
character encoding, data harvesting, syntactical
aspects and semantic integration. Only the last
point is of relevance in the context of this paper.
To enable semantic integration an ontology was
built that covers
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.940861565217391">
• nine metadata repositories;
• a file where all metadata concepts rele-
vant for the integrated domain ECHO
domain are listed including their descrip-
tion in a number of major languages (the
setup is similar to the one used within
ISO TC37/SC4);
• a file that includes all mappings between
these concepts where each individual set
presents a view that is mapped to all oth-
ers;
• two geographic thesauri containing dif-
ferent types of geographic information
with cross-links between them;
• two category thesauri describing the con-
tent of the resources;
• two mapping files containing one-
directional cross-links between the two
thesauri;
• a file that contains all content type of de-
scriptions that occur in the metadata re-
cords and which do not use one of the
big thesauri with mappings to these two.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993269230769">
As we are currently using the existing files sim-
ply as exchange formats they have been repre-
sented in XML (rather than RDF for instance).
To implement fast search, specially optimized
internal representations are chosen and combined
with fast indexes. The representations are such
that all occurring references are expanded in
preparation time and not during execution time.
A special engine was programmed that can oper-
ate on these extended representations.
To illustrate this we use an example with geo-
graphic thesaurus information. A search for
“Country=Italy” should result in hits for all ob-
jects that have to do with “Italy” either as the
creation site or as the site where the scene takes
place. The metadata records are now extended
such that for all locations that are within “Italy”
the nodes appearing higher up in the thesaurus
hierarchy are added. This assures that a record
containing for example “Rome” will also be in-
dicated as a hit when “Italy” was entered in the
query.
Exploiting all repositories during run-time by
intelligent crawlers would require fast parallel
algorithms. Only parallelism would yield the
execution speed needed to satisfy the users.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.639939">
Relation types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837583333333">
We have discovered different types of relations
between the concepts used in the INTERA and
ECHO projects.
In the INTERA project we can indicate internal
relations within the structured IMDI metadata
set, i.e., structure conveys semantic relations. An
example can be given by the many attributes of a
participant. A certain participant has a “name” as
an identifier and various attributes such as “age”,
“role” and “education”. Between the IMDI and
OLAC concepts there are three types of relations:
(1) For some concepts one can speak of equality
and it was agreed that the controlled vocabularies
will be unified where possible. (2) There are also
hierarchical relations such as “subClass” and
“superClass” between some of the concepts. (3)
There is a type of relation where we can speak
about a semantic overlap that we cannot specify
in more detail. Finally, there are concepts such as
“age” or “education” of a participant that do not
map at all.
For the mappings in ECHO we have identified
four useful types of relations: (1) “isEqualTo”
defines semantic equivalence, (2) “isSubclassOf”
defines a hyponymy relation, (3) “isSuperclas-
sOf” defines the inverse and (4) “mapsTo” is
used to express a semantic overlap. In most
cases, the “mapsTo” relation type was used – a
one-directional relation indicating semantic over-
lap that should be exploitable. It is not clear yet
in how far it makes sense to define the fuzzy
“mapsTo” relation in terms of the standard types
provided by RDF(S)8 and/or OWL9. All concepts
that do not map to others or that are too special
(for example “size of an image”) were excluded
in the ontology definition process.

Examples from ECHO

<bodyText confidence="0.992215">
Using the described ECHO interoperability
framework a number of experiments were carried
out for evaluation purposes. A few examples will
be discussed here.

Example 1
Simple Search “dogon”
1 match was found: NECEP: 1

View Language - language: 1 in NECEP
Complex Search “mali”
View Language - country: 1 in NECEP
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.947193909090909">
This example demonstrates the effect of the
mapping between the metadata sets and of the
geographical thesaurus. The language element is
mapped to the society name element in NECEP
although this is semantically not correct. Enter-
ing “mali” in the country specification yields a
hit since “mali” is seen as a superclass to
“dogon”. Here a relation type such as
“has_language” would be semantically more ap-
propriate.

These results are misleading and demonstrate the
weakness of simple search. The 73 hits for lan-
guage result from matching with the recording
place (“southern agriculture kindergarten”) and
the affiliation of an actor (“ministry of agricul-
ture”). These results obviously do not refer to
documents the user was serching for. In the case
of Fotothek the hits make sense since it is about
“harvesting”. The mapping in complex leads to
the expected results, the misleading hits from the
language domain are not found.

Again the rich annotations that are used in vari-
ous free-text fields in the language domain lead
to wrong hits. They are about chats at the bakery
shop and the clothes people are wearing – so it’s
not about clothing as an object which may be
intended by the person specifying the search. The
results for complex search from different do-
mains shows the correctness of the mappings.

This example clearly indicates the strength of
simple search and the weakness of complex
search. The pattern used by complex search can
be compared with a narrow path in the complex
semantic space. If selecting the title element the
hits of IMSS are found, if the content element is
chosen the Fotothek hits are found. Both, how-
ever, are leading to useful hits where “horses”
are central concepts in the resources. The reason
for the indicated results are partly caused by very
sparsely encoded metadata. In the case of IMSS
the term “horses” is only mentioned in the title,
the content element is yet not used. In the lan-
guage case thesaurus information is used to infer
from the string found in the title element (“spa-
tial layout task, farm scenarios”) to “horses”.

Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982578947368">
Only the first three relations (equality, hypo-
nomy, hyperonomy) can be used in a strictly
logical way. The fourth relation type is of a fuzzy
nature but occurs most frequently. To prevent a
semantic cycle during searching, the specially
tailored inference engine is restricted to one in-
ference step over this fuzzy relation and exploits
all relations only in one direction10. It is evident
that the existing ontology does not describe a
complete logical system.
In case of the INTERA project we will continue
to rely on a wrapper that will map IMDI to
OLAC records to allow OAI style of harvesting.
In the ECHO project we created optimized in-
dexes such that searching can be executed fast,
i.e., the knowledge components in XML are sim-
ply used as interchange formats allowing for the
easy identification of all structural components
and for their validation.

In the previous sections we described the current

<listItem confidence="0.982827823529412">
• In the ECHO project there are no con-

10 It should be noted, however, that advanced infer-
ence systems can handle semantic cycles of this na-
ture.
• The current definitions do not contain
hierarchical relations, which could be
part of the concept definitions if agreed
upon by the community.
• A contribution from other experts, for
example to improve the definitions and
to add other language specific aspects, is
largely excluded.
• The representation of the semantic rela-

tions between concepts is partly encapsu-
lated in a program preventing any
flexibility. In the ECHO case they are
structurally described with the help of
XML tags, however, it would be much
better to provide them in a way that in-
ference engines relying on RDF(S) and
OWL could operate on them.
From the practical work we learned that often the
semantic scope of the metadata elements is not
specified as precisely as seems possible and also
necessary. This will allow for a spectrum of us-
age that will have effects not only on human in-
terpretation, but especially on the way of
mapping relations to chose. It is obvious from
this experience that users will not always agree
on the interpretation of the definitions and on the
types of mappings applied. At this moment we
cannot make final statements in how far hierar-
chical relations will be effected by this that
would constitute an implicit thesaurus as is ex-
pected within ISO TC37/SC4.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.879516">
Open Data Category Repositories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999405882353">
Based on the experience so far it can be recom-
mended to include into open repositories only
concepts that have been used for a while and
therefore have shown their semantic stability
within a certain community. For the area of lan-
guage resources ISO TC37/SC4 is on the way to
create such a repository, which is compliant with
widely recognized standards such as ISO 11179
and ISO 12620. Therefore, it makes sense to reg-
ister all elements used within IMDI and OLAC
as data categories in this repository.
This will open up several new possibilities for
projects and initiatives: (1) IMDI and OLAC can
create schemas that define their sets by referring
to machine-readable definitions. For instance, an
equality relationship can be directly indicated by
referring to the same data category registry
(DCR) entry. Search engines could make use of
this information. (2) It is our experience that pro-
jects often like to tailor their own metadata sets
due to their specific needs. In this case an open
registry would simply allow to create a new
schema and to re-use existing definitions as
much as possible11. By referring to DCR entries
again a direct form of interoperability is
achieved.
We assume that we will have widely recognized
DCRs as currently defined within ISO
TC37/SC4. They should contain the concepts
that are based on a wide agreement within com-
munities. However, due to the slow acceptance
processes within standardization bodies and the
different needs that result for example from dif-
ferent languages there could be a need for re-
searchers to set up their own temporary DCRs.
We therefore foresee a large number of data
category repositories.
For the ECHO project the usage of an open DCR
is not yet an option. To be of use for the commu-
nity there has to be a wide acceptance. The do-
main of “cultural heritage” addressed within
ECHO covers too many different disciplines and
the concepts are semantically mostly too differ-
ent. Disciplines such as history of arts, history of
science and ethnology have to start their disci-
pline oriented discussion process to define useful
concepts and to start building widely recognized
registries. What seems necessary is to start creat-
ing files with concept definitions that can be eas-
ily integrated later into open registries and that
are compliant to emerging standards.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.902089">
Open Relation repositories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888923076923">
Concept definitions in DCRs are one important
aspect in defining metadata ontologies. Another
aspect are repositories that store relations be-
tween these concepts. From our experience in the
two projects mentioned, it seems required to
separate these two types of information in order
to achieve a high degree of independence and
flexibility. However, other experiences as that of
the GOLD initiative (Farrar, 2005) indicate that
opinions on this vary largely.
Theoretically, it is possible to include all infor-
mation that defines a concept into the DCR. The
concept “country” that is used within IMDI is

11 IMDI already provides a step towards this kind of
flexibility by allowing projects to define profiles or
individuals to define new key-value pairs.

typically a sub-part of a “continent”. However,
the proper definition of the concept “country” in
the context of language resources is not depend-
ent on the availability of this hierarchical rela-
tion. But this again may be completely different
for abstract linguistic concepts such as “transitive
verb” where we know that the class relation
“transitive-verb isSubClassOf verb” is part of the
definition.
In general, we argue that whenever it is not
strictly necessary for the proper definition of a
concept, relation aspects should be kept outside
of DCRs as much as possible, since they often
form a constraint with only little agreement.
For the represention of relations in a machine-
readable format, RDF(S) seems to be the most
suitable choice. In RDF, all relations are repre-
sented as tertiary assertions as indicated in Figure
1. Actually, each of these RDF assertions defines
a relation between two resources, since the value
can be an arbitrary web-resource as well.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.84077">
Figure 1 shows a basic RDF assertion specifying that
a (web) resource identified by a URI has properties
that may have values.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.992432076923077">
Obviously, this simple mechanism allows us to
create complex repositories of semantic relations.
Since all objects of such an assertion can be web-
resources we can for example point to concepts
defined in a DCR and relate them with each
other.
From the two mentioned projects we can give
two typical examples. From the INTERA project
we notice that according to our interpretation the
concept “IMDI:Participant.Role=Collector” is a
sub-class of “OLAC:Creator” (Figure 2).

would first have to write a wrapper that converts
XML structure information into RDF assertions.
We can imagine that RDF will be used by some
projects, initiatives and institutions to establish
widely recognized and used repositories with
mapping relations.
We also assume that many persons, projects and
institutions will create their own mappings to
tune their operations like searching according to
their specific needs, i.e., a large variety of “prac-
tical ontologies” will emerge. These practical
ontologies may re-use most of the semantics
found in a repository, or they overwrite a certain
number of relations or they introduce new rela-
tions that are not yet defined elsewhere.
In contrast to the ISO data category repository
that is based on the experiences of the work
about ISO 11179 and ISO 12620, there is no
work yet of how to represent relations for the
domain of language resources. For INTERA this
creates the need of using ad hoc solutions. ISO
TC37/SC4 should urgently take up this issue.

Given the discussion above, we can expect the
Semantic Web era to produce a large number of
data category definitions stored in different
DCRs and mapping relations between these
stored in other repositories. Amongst these com-
ponents there will be some that deserve a larger
interest by the language resource community,
since they are maintained by recognized experts,
but there will also be many others created within
projects and institutions or even by individuals to
satisfy only ad-hoc purposes. Therefore, we need
an infrastructure for registering these compo-
nents for making them visible and searchable.
Current inference engines such as provided by
Jena12 assume that there is one database of mean-
ingful RDF triples. This would allow us to inte-
grate all our mapping relations from the INTERA
or ECHO ontologies (such as “Country isSub-
ClassOf Continent” and “Place isSubClassOf
Country”), that is currently part of an XML-
based thesaurus. To arrive at an RDF-based da-
tabase instead, we would need to harvest meta-
data from the XML-based thesaurus, i.e., we

Further, we would like to harvest RDF triples
from different sites, since we need to integrate
already existing knowledge. Two problems can
be foreseen here: (1) How do we know where to
find useful RDF triple instances? We need
mechanisms to register the existence of sites with
that type of information and to semi-formally
describe the content. (2) When we harvest triples
from such a site we may include knowledge –
metadata ontologies defined in RDF(S) - that is
conflicting with what is already available. How
can we deal with this and how can we be selec-
tive?
Currently, there are no answers to these ques-
tions. But they have to be addressed soon. Also
here ISO TC37/SC4 could play an important
role, since it is about infrastructure aspects that
have to be worked out for the language resource
community.

5 XML vs RDF

We explained why XML was chosen in repre-
senting the knowledge involved in the projects
mentioned. Mainly short-term arguments guided
us to take this decision. This may not be the cor-
rect decision in the long-term. Nevertheless, also
ISO TC37/SC4 has chosen to represent data
category definitions as XML structures including
hierarchical references needed to properly define
a concept.
The underlying data models of XML and RDF
are very different. XML is based on a tree model,
i.e., it has a strong bias towards hierarchies. All
expressive power is gained from structural rela-
tions, which to a certain extent allow for the rep-
resentation of semantic relations.
In contrast to this, RDF is based on a loose col-
lection of relations. It is therefore very simple to
combine relations from different RDF reposito-
ries into larger collections. Although implicit
hierarchies will be difficult to recover.
Semantically, RDF Schema offers the user the
option to define the value range of any user-
defined relation (property) used in an RDF file
with user-defined classes, while XML only offers
basic data types. OWL has even more expressive
power. A good overview is given by Gil and
Ratnaker, 2001.
Summarizing, we would like to emphasize the
following two points that need to be taken into
account by any follow-up projects of INTERA
and ECHO. Such a project should:

<listItem confidence="0.953934181818182">
• represent all concept definitions of a resource
metadata set in an ISO DCR compliant way
and turn them over to RDF-based reposito-
ries that may emerge within the disciplines in
the coming years;
• represent relations as much as possible in
external RDF(S)-based metadata ontologies
using all needed expressional power of
RDF(S) and OWL so that users can easily
add their own relations or reformulate exist-
ing ones.

6 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999988111111111">
The work on metadata interoperability in the two
projects mentioned clearly indicate that this type
of work is in its beginning phase. Ad hoc meth-
ods are used to achieve high speed and to guaran-
tee efficient exchange of knowledge components,
but they form obstacles on the way towards a
flexible and open Semantic Web type of infra-
structures. The examples indicate that the chosen
mapping strategies lead to the expected results in
many cases. They also indicate some of the prob-
lems that are associated with using specific ele-
ments for searching. Amongst others these are
caused by sparsely filled in metadata descrip-
tions, unawareness about the underlying element
semantics, insufficient mappings between meta-
data elements and thesaurus concepts.
The usage of ISO 11179 and ISO 12620 compli-
ant open Data Category Registries for machine
readable definitions of metadata concepts within
INTERA is a first step in the right direction.
However, other disciplines than linguistics lack
such a widely agreed registry type. For building
up and combining repositories of RDF-based
relations between registered concepts there is yet
no infrastructure. Even in the linguistics domain
yet there is no suggestion for standards. ISO
TC37/SC4 should take up this issue, since Data
Category repositories with concept definitions
and relation repositories are mutually dependent
on each other to form exploitable knowledge
bases. Due to the many contributions from pro-
jects, institutions and even individuals that will
disagree with proposed definitions and relations
we will need an efficient infrastructure for dis-
covering and combining useful knowledge com-
ponents.

<abstract confidence="0.99551604">Within two European projects metadata interoperability is one of the central topics. While the INTERA project has as one of its goals to achieve an interoperability between two widely used metadata sets for the domain of language resources, the ECHO project created an integrated metadata domain of in total nine data providers from five different disciplines from the humanities. In both projects ad hoc techniques are used to achieve results. In the INTERA project, however, machine readable and ISO compliant concept definitions are created as a first step towards the Semantic Web. In the ECHO project a complex ontology was realized purely relying on XML. It is argued that concept definitions should be registered in open Data Category Repositories and that relations between them should be described as RDF assertions. Yet we are missing standards that would allow us to overcome the ad hoc solutions.</abstract>
