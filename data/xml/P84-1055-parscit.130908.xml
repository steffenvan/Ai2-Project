argument dialogues. These are special words and
phrases directly indicating the structure of the
argument to the hearer. Two main conclusions are
drawn: 1) clue words can occur in conjunction with
coherent transmissions, to reduce processing of the
hearer 2) clue words must occur with more complex
forms of transmission, to facilitate recognition of
the argument structure. Interpretation rules to
process clues are proposed. In addition, a
relationship between use of clues and complexity of
processing is suggested for the case of exceptional
transmission strategies.

I Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97252496969697">
In argument dialogues, one often encounters words
which serve to indicate overall structure - phrases
that link individual propositions to form one
coherent presentation. Other researchers in
language understanding have acknowledged the
existence of these &amp;quot;clue words&amp;quot;. Birnbaum
[Birnbaum 82] states that in order to recognize
argument structures it would be useful to identify
typical signals of each form.
In [Cohen 83] we develop a computational model for
argument analysis. The setting is a dialogue where
the speaker tries to convince the hearer of a
particular point of view; as a first step, the
hearer tries to construct a representation for the
structure of the argument, indicating the
underlying claim and evidence relations between
propositions. Within this framework, a theory of
linguistic clues is developed which categorizes the
function of different phrases, presenting
interpretation rules.
What we have done is develop a model for argument
analysis which is sufficiently well-defined in
terms of algorithms, with measurable complexity, to
allow convenient study of the effect of clue words
on processing. Two important observations are
made: (1) clue words cut processing of the hearer
in recognizing coherent transmissions (2) clue
words are used to allow the recognition of
transmissions which would be incoherent (too
complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues.
Considering arguments as goal-oriented dialogues,
the use of clue words by the speaker can be
construed as attempts to facilitate the hearer&apos;s

plan reconstruction process. Thus, there exist
words and even entire statements with the sole
function of indicating structure (vs. content) in
the argument. The importance of structure to
argument understanding is first of all a by-product
of our imposed pragmatic approach to analysis. To
understand the argument intended by the speaker,
the hearer must determine, for each proposition
uttered, both where it fits with respect to the
dialogue so far and how, in particular, it relates
to some prior statement. In addition, it is
precisely the expected form of arguments which can
be used to control the analysis (since content
can&apos;t be stereotyped as in the case of stories).
It is this importance of form which necessitates
clue words and presents the research problem of
specifiying their function precisely.

<bodyText confidence="0.980933740740741">
II Background
To understand the role of clue words in
facilitating analysis, some detail on the overall
argument understanding model is required. (For
further reference, see [Cohen 80], [Cohen 81],
[Cohen 83.1). Each proposition of the argument is
analyzed, in turn, with respect to the argument so
far. A proposition is interpreted by determining
the claim and evidence relations it shares with the
rest of the argument&apos;s propositions. Leaving the
verification of evidence to an oracle, the main
analysis task is determining where a current
proposition fits.
To understand the examples introduced in this
paper, it is useful to present the starting
definition of evidence, as used in the model. A
proposition P is evidence for a proposition Q if
there is some rule of inference such that P is
premise to Q&apos;s conclusion. The rule most often
observed is modus ponens, with missing major
premise - i.e. P, Q are given and one must fill
P --&gt; Q to recognize the support intended from P to
Q. More detail on the definition of evidence is
presented in [Cohen 837.
Determining an interpretation for a proposition is
restricted to a computationally reasonable task by
characterizing possible coherent transmission
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999788454545455">
strategies on the part of the speaker and reducing
analysis to a recognition of these forms. These
algorithms are outlined in detail in LCohen 83].
The basic restrictions yield a limited set of
propositions to search. The representation is a
tree of claim and evidence relations where evidence
are sons to the father claim. Essentially, the
last proposition eligible to relate to the current
is tracked (called LAST). LAST and its ancestors
in the tree are all eligible relatives and each is
tested in turn, to set the interpretation of the
current proposition. The analysis algorithm is
termed &amp;quot;hybrid reception&amp;quot; because it is designed to
recognize transmission strategies where each
constituent sub—argument is presented either claim
first or claim last. Complexity analysis of this
algorithm indicates that it works in linear time
(i.e. it takes a linear factor of the number of
nodes of the tree to locate all propositions in the
representation).
A sample tree and the processing required for the
current proposition is illustrated below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998218166666667">
initial: ; final:
1\,_
-)N, /1\
2 3 6‘/1
2/ N.,&apos;■6
7 -) ■,,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.88473006060606">
With the initial argument above, a new proposition
(8) would be checked to be evidence for 7, 6, 5 and
1 in turn. If these tests fail, it is then
attached as a son to the dummy root (expecting a
father in upcoming propositions). The final tree
above, for example, may result if the next
proposition (9) is processed and succeeds as father
to 8. Note that in processing 8 initially, 4, 3.
and 2 were not eligible relatives. This is because
an earlier brother to a subsequent proposition is
closed off from consideration according to the
specifications of the hybrid algorithm. See
Appendix I for a detailed description of possible
coherent transmission strategies and their
&amp;quot;reception&amp;quot; algorithms.
III Clues to reduce processing (Helpfulness)
With coherent transmissions characterized, the
role of clue words can be investigated more
closely. Note first that the restrictions of the
analysis algorithms are such that the proposition
to which the current one relates is not always the
immediate prior proposition. In fact, sometimes
the claim is located far back in the dialogue.
Consider the following example:
EX1: 1)The city is a mess
2)The parks are a disaster
3)The playground area is all run down
24)The sandboxes are dirty
5)The swings are broken
6)The highway system also needs
revamping
Here, the representation for the argument is the
following tree:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7422945">
7.1,6
4 5
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.92252226">
The last proposition, 6, is evidence for 1, one of
the claims higher up in the tree. Many arguments
which re—address earlier claims assist the hearer
by specifically including a clue of re—direction as
in EX2 below.
EX2: 1)The city is a mess
2)The parks are a disaster
3)The playground area is all run down
4)The swings are broken
5)The sandboxes are dirty
6)Returning to city problems, the highway
system needs revamping
Here, the search up the right border of the tree
(from 5, 3, 2 to 1) for a possible claim to the
current proposition 6 is cut short and the correct
father (1) indicated directly. One can hypothesize
a general reduction on processing complexity from
linear to real—time, if clues are consistently used
by the speaker to re—direct the hearer with chains
that are sufficiently long.
Connectives are another type of clue word, used
extensively. Hobbs (LHobbs 76J) attempts a
characterization with respect to his coherence
relations for a couple of words. Reichman
(LReichman 81J) associates certain expressions with
particular conversational moves, but there is no
unified attempt at classification. We develop a
taxonomy so that clues of the same semantic
function are grouped to assign one interpretation
rule for the dominated proposition within the claim
and evidence framework. Consider the following
example:
EX3: 1)The city needs help
2)All the roads are ruined
3)The buildings are crumbling
4)As a result, we are asking
for federal support
with the representation:
2 3
The connective in 4, &amp;quot;as a result&amp;quot;, suggests that
some prior proposition connects to 4 and that this
proposition acts as evidence for 4. The relation
of the prior proposition is set out below according
the the interpretation rule for the category that
&amp;quot;as a result&amp;quot; belongs to in the taxonomy. The
particular evidence connection advocated here is of
the form: &amp;quot;If our city needs help, then we will
ask for federal aid&amp;quot;. iNote: Whether 1 is
evidence for 4 is tested by trying a modus ponens
major premise of the form: &amp;quot;(For all cities) if a

.he hybrid specifications. In EX5, however, a
parallel construction is specifically indicated
through clue words, so that the connections can be
recognized by the hearer and the appropriate
representation constructed as below:
city needs help, then it can ask for federal aid&amp;quot;,
and then using &amp;quot;our city&amp;quot; as the specific case).
The taxonomy (drawn from [Quirk 72]) is intended
to cover the class of connectives and presents
default interpretation rules.

inference son as a result
summary multiple sons in sum
reformulation father and son in other words
contrast father or brother conversely
Note that the classification of connectives
provides a reduction in processing for the hearer.
For example, in EX3 with a casual connective, the
analysis for the proposition 4 is restricted to a
search for a son. In short, connective
interpretation rules help specify the type of
relation between propositions; re—direction clues
help determine which prior proposition is related
to the current one. All together, clue words
function to reduce overall processing operations.
See Appendix II for more examples of relations of
the taxonomy.

IV Clues to support complex transmissions (Necessity)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956284945454545">
Clue words also exist in conjunction with
transmissions which violate the constraints of the
hybrid model of expected coherent structure. The
claim is that clues provide a necessary reduction
in complexity, to enable the hearer to recognize
the intended structure. Consider the following
examples:
EX4: 1)The city is a mess
2)The parks are run down
3)The highways need revamping
4)The buildings are crumbling
5)The sandbox area is a mess
EX5: 1)The city is a mess
2)The parks are run down
3)The highways need revamping
4)The buildings are crumbling
5)With regard to parks,
the sandboxes are a mess
6)As for the highways, the gravel is shot
7)And as for the buildings,
the bricks are rotting
The initial tree for the argument is as follows:
1
2 3 4
In EX4, the last proposition cannot be interpreted
as desired; the probable intended father
proposition (2) is not an eligible candidate to
relate to the current proposition (5) according to
It now becomes important to provide a framework
for accommodating &amp;quot;extended&amp;quot; transmission
strategies in the model. First, the complexity of
processing without clues is a good measure for
determining whether a strategy should be considered
exceptional. Then, to be acceptable in the model
the proposed transmission must have some
characterizable algorithm — i.e. still reflect a
coherent plan of the speaker. Further, exceptional
tranmsission strategies must be clearly marked by
the speaker, using clues, in cases where the
transmission can be assigned an alternate reading
according to the basic processing strategy. The
hearer should be expected to expend the minimum
computational effort, so that the onus is on the
speaker to make exceptional readings explicit.
In brief, we propose developing a &amp;quot;clue
interpetation module&amp;quot; for the analysis model, which
would be called by the basic proposition analyzer
to handle extended transmissions in the presence of
clues. Then, complexity of processing should be
used as a guide for determining the preferred
analysis.
To illustrate, consider another acceptable
extended transmission strategy — mixed—mode
sub—arguments, where evidence both precedes and
follows a claim.

<figureCaption confidence="0.549370083333333">
Here, it is preferable to keep 1 and 2 as evidence
for 3, because this requires less computational
effort than the re—attachment of sons which takes
place to construct the other possible
representation. In other words, computational
effort is a good guide for the specification of
processing strategies.
Finally, it is worth noting that the specific clue
word used may influence the processing for these
extended transmissions. In EX6, if the last
proposition (4) was introduced by the clue word &amp;quot;in
addition&amp;quot;, then the alternate tree would not be an

forces 4 to find a brother among the earlier
propositions, according to the interpretation rule

connectives.
In sum, we propose particular extended
transmission strategies for the model, including
(i) parallel (ii) mixed—mode (iii) multiple
relations. [Note: More discussion of (iii) is in
[Cohen 33]. We consider as an acceptable
exceptional strategy the case where one proposition
acts as evidence for an entire set of claims
following it immediately in the stream. Other
configurations of multiple relations seem to
present additional processing problems]. We demand
clue words to facilitate the analysis and we begin
to suggest how to accommodate uses of these
exceptional cases in the overall analysis model.
V Related Topics
A. Nature of clues
The exact specification of a clue is a topic for
further research. Since it is hypothesized that
clues are necessary to admit exceptional
transmissions, what constitutes a clue is a key
issue. Within Quirk&apos;s classification of
connectives ([Quirk 721) both special words and
connecting phrases (&amp;quot;integrated markers&amp;quot;) are
possible. For example, one may say &amp;quot;in conclusion&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;I will conclude by saying&amp;quot;.
Quirk also discusses several mechanisms for
indicating connectives which need to be examined
more closely as candidates for clue words. These
constructions are all &amp;quot;indirect&amp;quot; indications.
a) lexical equivalence: This includes the case
where synonyms are used to suggest a connection to
a previous clause. For example: &amp;quot;The monkey
learned to use a tractor. By age 9, he could work
solo on the vehicle.&amp;quot; In searching for evidence
relations, the hearer may faciltate his analysis by
recognizing this type of connective device. But it
unclear that the construction should be considered
an additional &amp;quot;clue&amp;quot;.
b) substitution, reference, comparison, ellipsis:
Here, the &amp;quot;abbreviated&amp;quot; nature of the constructions
may be significant enough to provide an extra
signal to the hearer. For now, we do not consider
these devices as clues, but examine the relations
between the use of anaphors and clues in the next
section.
Even within the classification of connectives,
there is a question of level of explicitness of the
clues. Consider the example:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.847693666666667">
EX7: 1)The city is dangerous
2a)I will now tell you why this is so
2b)The reason for the danger is...
2c)The reason is...
2d)The problem is ...
2a) is an explicit indication of evidence; b) and
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.990220451612903">
c) have a phrase indicating a causal connection,
but c) requires a kind of referent resolution as
well; d) requires recognizing &amp;quot;the problem&amp;quot; as an
indication of cause. The problem addressed in this
example is similar to the one faced by Allen
([Allen 79]): handling a variety of surface forms
which all convey the same intention. In our case,
the &amp;quot;intention&amp;quot; is that one proposition act as
evidence for another.
Finally, there are different kinds of special
phrases used to influence the credibilty of the
hearer: 1) attitudinal expressions reflecting the
speaker&apos;s beliefs and 2) expressions of emphasis.
Since our model focuses on the first step in
processing of recognizing structural connections,
these clues have not be examined more closely.
However, examples of these expressions are listed
in Appendix III, along with phrases indicating
structure.
B. Relation to reference resolution and focus
There are some important similarities between our
approach to reconstructing argument structure and
the problem of representing focus for referent
resolution addressed in LSidner 79] and LGrosz 77J.
For both tasks, a particular kind of semantic
relation between parts of a dialogue must be found
and verified. In both cases, a hierarchical
representation is constructed to hold structural
information and is searched in some restricted
fashion.
Grosz&apos;s hierarchical model of focus spaces, with
visibility constraints imposed by the task domain,
is maintained in a fashion similar to our tree
model. Information on which of the focus spaces is
&amp;quot;active&amp;quot; and which are &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; (possible to shift
to) is kept; open spaces are determined by the
active space and the visibilty constraints.
Analysis for a problem such as resolving definite
noun phrase referents can be limited by choosing
only those items &amp;quot;in focus&amp;quot;.
In [Sidner 79] focus is introduced to determine
eligible candidates for a co—specification. But
the ultimate choice rests with verification by the
hearer, using inferencing, that the focus element
relates to the anaphor. This is parallel to our
approach of narrowing the search for a
proposition&apos;s intepretation, but requiring testing
of possible relations in order to establish the
desired link. To set the focus, Sidner suggests
either: 1) using special words to signal the
hearer or 2) relying on shared knowledge to
establish an unstated connection. This is
analogous to our cases of processing with and
without clues.
In Sidner&apos;s theory there is also a clear
distinction between returning to an element
previously in focus (one from the focus stack) or
choosing a completely &amp;quot;new topic&amp;quot; from prior
elements (using the alternate focus list). We
distinguish returning to some ancestor of the last
proposition (a choice of eligible proposition) from
the case of re—addressing a &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; proposition.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995829">
254
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9463436">
In this latter case, we require a clue word to
re—direct. What we have tried to do is clearly
separate eligible relatives from exceptional cases
and connect the required use of clues to the
exceptional category. Grosz and Sidner both allow
&amp;quot;focus shifts&amp;quot; and Sidner explicitly discusses uses
of &amp;quot;special phrases&amp;quot;, but we have tried to study
the connections between clues and exceptions more
closely.
Finally, it is worth noting that the problem of
reference resolution is similar to that of evidence
determination, but still distinct. In the example
below, constraints suggested by referent resolution
theories should not be violated by our restricted
processing suggestions:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.7288355">
EX8: 1)The city is a mess
2)The park is ruined
3)The highway is run down
4)Every 3 miles, you find a pothole in it
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.97591178125">
In 4, &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is resolved as referring to &amp;quot;the
highway&amp;quot; in 3; this proposition is eligible and
the closer connection is preferred.
But clue interpretation is not equivalent to
referent resolution. The clue &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; may be
expressed as &amp;quot;one example for this is&amp;quot; but could
also be presented as &amp;quot;one example for this problem
is&amp;quot;. Since the search for a referent may differ
according to the surface form ([Sidner 79]) there
is no clear mapping from processing propositions
with clues to those with referents. For our model,
surface form may vary widely, but the search is
restricted according to interpretation rules for a
taxonomy — according to the semantics of the clue —
and the solution is dictated by the structure of
the argument so far.
C. Necessity in the base case
The main points raised in this paper are that
clues can be used with a basic transmission
strategy to cut processing and must be used in more
complex transmissions. The question of whether
certain basic transmissions still require clues is
worth investigating further. In particular, it has
been suggested (personal communication with
psychologists) that deep stacks require clues to
remind the hearer, due to &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; limitations. It
may be productive to examine the computational
properties of this situation more closely.
Further, clues are often used to delineate
sub—arguments when shifting topics. Again, some
memory limitations for the hearer may be in effect
here.

VI Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999030076923077">
In conclusion, this paper outlines one crucial
component of the computational model for argument
analysis described in [Cohen 83]. It presents a
first attempt at a solid framework for clue
interpretation within argument understanding. The
approach of studying goal—based dialogue and
structure reconstruction also allows us to comment
on the the function of clue words within analysis.
The theory of clue interpretation gives insight
into a known construction within sample dialogues;
examining the computational properties provides a
framework for design of the analysis model. It is
important to note that there has been no effort to
date to study the use of clue words extensively,
distinguishing cases where they occur and
suggesting when clues are necessary. The clue
theory presented here also has possible
implications for other application areas. For
example, in resolving referents Sidner (LSidner
791) has suggested that clues will occur whenever
the alternate focus list is consulted, beyond the
focus stack default. Our claim is that the
necessity for clues is closely tied to the
complexity of processing and the reduction in
processing operations afforded by the additional
structural information provided by the clue words.

Appendix I: Coherent Transmission Strategies
Coherent transmissions are illustrated and
reception algorithms required to recognize these
transmissions outlined. This material is first
introduced in LCohen 81].
a)PRE-ORDER: state claim, then present evidence
EXA1: 1)Jones would make a good president 1
2)He has lots of experience /\
3)He&apos;s been on the board for 10 years 2 4
4)And he&apos;s honest I 1
5)He refused bribes while on the force 3 5
In the above example, each claim consistently
precedes its evidence in the stream of
propositions.
b)POST-ORDER: present evidence, then state claim
EXA2: 1)Jones has been on the board 10 years 5
2)He has lots of experience
3)And he&apos;s refused bribes
4)So he&apos;s honest 1
5)He would really make a good president 1 3
Here, the comparable example in post-order (where
evidence precedes claim in the stream) is still
coherent.
The hearer can construct particular reception
algorithms to recognize either of the transmission
strategies. To interpret a current proposition in
the case of pre-order transmission, the hearer must
simply look for a father; in fact, the test is
performed only on the last proposition and its
ancestors, up the right border of the tree. In
post-order, the algorithm makes use of a stack to
hold potential sons to the current proposition;
the test is to be father to the top of the stack;
if the test succeeds, all sons are popped and the
resulting tree pushed onto the stack; if the test
fails, the current proposition is added to the top
of the stack.
c)HYBRID: any sub-argument may be in pre- or post-
order
EXA3: 1)Jones would make a good president 1
2)He has lots of experience /&apos;\
3)He&apos;s been on the board 10 years 2 5
4)And he&apos;s refused bribes / I
5)So he&apos;s honest 3 4
The above example illustrates a coherent hybrid
transmission. The hybrid reception algorithm is
then a good approximation to a general processing
strategy used by the speaker. Essentially, the
algorithm combines techniques from pre- and post-
order reception algorithms, where both a father and
sons for a current proposition must be found. The
search is still restricted, as certain propositions
are closed off as eligible relatives to the current
one, according to the specifications of the hybrid
transmission. There is an additional problem, due
to the fact that evidence is treated as a
transitive relation. Sons are to be attached to
their immediate father; so, it may be necessary to
relocate sons that have been attached initially to
a higher ancestor. This situation is illustrated
below:
2 3
47 5
Here, 4 an 5 would succeed as evidence for 1
(since they are evidence for 6 and 6 is evidence
for 1); they will initially attach to 1 and
relocate as sons to 6 when 6 attaches as son to 1.
Here is an outline of the proposed hybrid reception
algorithm. It makes uses of a dummy root node, for
which all nodes are evidence. L is a pointer into
the tree, representing the lowest node that can
receive more evidence. For every node NEW in the
input stream:

if NEW evidence for L then
if no sons of L are evidence for NEW then
/* just test lastson for evidence*/
attach NEW below L
set L to NEW
exit forever loop
else
attach all sons of L which are
evidence for L below NEW
/* attach lastson; bump ptr. to lastson */
/* back 1 and keep testing for evidence */
attach NEW below L
exit forever loop
else set L to father (L)

LCohen 81] first suggests using common
interpretation rules for connectives in one
category of a taxonomy. Various examples presented
in that paper are included here as additional
background. In the discussion below, S refers to
the proposition with the clue; P refers to the
prior proposition which connects to S.
1)Parallel: This category includes the most basic
connectors like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; as well as lists of
clues (e.g. &amp;quot;First, secondly, thirdly...&amp;quot;). P
must be brother to S. Finding a brother involves
locating the common father when testing evidence
relations.
EXA4: 1)The city is in serious trouble /1\
2)There are some fires going 2 4
3)Three separate blazes have broken out &apos;3
4)In addition, a tornado is passing through

The parallel category has additional rules for
cases where lists of clues are present. Then,
propositions with clues from the same list must
relate. But note that it is not always a brother
relation between these specific propositions. In
fact, the brothers are the propositions which serve
as claims in each sub—argument controlled by a list
clue.
EXA5: 1)The city is awful /1\
2)First, no one cleans the parks 3 4
3)So the parks are ugly \
4)Then the roads are a mess 2 5
5)There&apos;s always garbage there
Here, 2 and 4 contain the clues; 3 and 4 are
brothers.
2)Inference: There are clues like &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot;
which directly indicate inferences being drawn.
The classification of &amp;quot;result&amp;quot; covers cause and
which contrasts another directly without evidence
presented, is a (counter) claim, and hence S is a
brother to P.

5)Reformulation: The taxonomy rule suggests
looking for a prior proposition to be both father

reformulation is included in [Cohen 83].

complex, for now we interpret a proposition which
offers contrast to some evidence for a claim as

<abstract confidence="0.998341003944773">This paper examines the use of clue words in argument dialogues. These are special words and phrases directly indicating the structure of the argument to the hearer. Two main conclusions are drawn: 1) clue words can occur in conjunction with coherent transmissions, to reduce processing of the hearer 2) clue words must occur with more complex forms of transmission, to facilitate recognition of the argument structure. Interpretation rules to process clues are proposed. In addition, a relationship between use of clues and complexity of processing is suggested for the case of exceptional transmission strategies. I Overview In argument dialogues, one often encounters words which serve to indicate overall structure phrases that link individual propositions to form one coherent presentation. Other researchers in language understanding have acknowledged the existence of these &amp;quot;clue words&amp;quot;. Birnbaum [Birnbaum 82] states that in order to recognize structures it would be useful to typical signals of each form. [Cohen we a computational model for argument analysis. The setting is a dialogue where the speaker tries to convince the hearer of a particular point of view; as a first step, the hearer tries to construct a representation for the structure of the argument, indicating the underlying claim and evidence relations between propositions. Within this framework, a theory of linguistic clues is developed which categorizes the function of different phrases, presenting interpretation rules. What we have done is develop a model for argument analysis which is sufficiently well-defined in terms of algorithms, with measurable complexity, to allow convenient study of the effect of clue words on processing. Two important observations are made: (1) clue words cut processing of the hearer in recognizing coherent transmissions (2) clue words are used to allow the recognition of transmissions which would be incoherent (too complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues. Considering arguments as goal-oriented dialogues, the use of clue words by the speaker can be construed as attempts to facilitate the hearer&apos;s plan reconstruction process. Thus, there exist words and even entire statements with the sole function of indicating structure (vs. content) in the argument. The importance of structure to argument understanding is first of all a by-product of our imposed pragmatic approach to analysis. To understand the argument intended by the speaker, the hearer must determine, for each proposition uttered, both where it fits with respect to the dialogue so far and how, in particular, it relates to some prior statement. In addition, it is precisely the expected form of arguments which can be used to control the analysis (since content can&apos;t be stereotyped as in the case of stories). It is this importance of form which necessitates clue words and presents the research problem of specifiying their function precisely. II Background To understand the role of clue words in facilitating analysis, some detail on the overall argument understanding model is required. (For further reference, see [Cohen 80], [Cohen 81], Each proposition of the argument is analyzed, in turn, with respect to the argument so far. A proposition is interpreted by determining the claim and evidence relations it shares with the rest of the argument&apos;s propositions. Leaving the verification of evidence to an oracle, the main analysis task is determining where a current proposition fits. To understand the examples introduced in this paper, it is useful to present the starting definition of evidence, as used in the model. A proposition P is evidence for a proposition Q if there is some rule of inference such that P is premise to Q&apos;s conclusion. The rule most often observed is modus ponens, with missing major premise i.e. P, Q are given and one must fill P --&gt; Q to recognize the support intended from P to Q. More detail on the definition of evidence is presented in [Cohen 837. Determining an interpretation for a proposition is restricted to a computationally reasonable task by characterizing possible coherent transmission 251 strategies on the part of the speaker and reducing analysis to a recognition of these forms. These algorithms are outlined in detail in LCohen 83]. The basic restrictions yield a limited set of propositions to search. The representation is a tree of claim and evidence relations where evidence are sons to the father claim. Essentially, the last proposition eligible to relate to the current is tracked (called LAST). LAST and its ancestors in the tree are all eligible relatives and each is tested in turn, to set the interpretation of the current proposition. The analysis algorithm is termed &amp;quot;hybrid reception&amp;quot; because it is designed to recognize transmission strategies where each constituent sub—argument is presented either claim first or claim last. Complexity analysis of this algorithm indicates that it works in linear time (i.e. it takes a linear factor of the number of nodes of the tree to locate all propositions in the representation). A sample tree and the processing required for the current proposition is illustrated below: initial: ; final: 3 7 -) ■,, With the initial argument above, a new proposition (8) would be checked to be evidence for 7, 6, 5 and 1 in turn. If these tests fail, it is then attached as a son to the dummy root (expecting a father in upcoming propositions). The final tree above, for example, may result if the next proposition (9) is processed and succeeds as father 8. Note that in processing 8 initially, 4, 3. and 2 were not eligible relatives. This is because an earlier brother to a subsequent proposition is closed off from consideration according to the specifications of the hybrid algorithm. See Appendix I for a detailed description of possible coherent transmission strategies and their &amp;quot;reception&amp;quot; algorithms. III Clues to reduce processing (Helpfulness) With coherent transmissions characterized, the role of clue words can be investigated more closely. Note first that the restrictions of the analysis algorithms are such that the proposition to which the current one relates is not always the immediate prior proposition. In fact, sometimes the claim is located far back in the dialogue. Consider the following example: EX1: 1)The city is a mess 2)The parks are a disaster 3)The playground area is all run down sandboxes are dirty 5)The swings are broken 6)The highway system also needs revamping Here, the representation for the argument is the following tree: The last proposition, 6, is evidence for 1, one of the claims higher up in the tree. Many arguments which re—address earlier claims assist the hearer by specifically including a clue of re—direction as in EX2 below. EX2: 1)The city is a mess 2)The parks are a disaster 3)The playground area is all run down 4)The swings are broken 5)The sandboxes are dirty 6)Returning to city problems, the highway system needs revamping Here, the search up the right border of the tree 3, to 1) for a possible claim to the current proposition 6 is cut short and the correct father (1) indicated directly. One can hypothesize a general reduction on processing complexity from linear to real—time, if clues are consistently used by the speaker to re—direct the hearer with chains that are sufficiently long. Connectives are another type of clue word, used extensively. Hobbs (LHobbs 76J) attempts a characterization with respect to his coherence relations for a couple of words. Reichman (LReichman 81J) associates certain expressions with particular conversational moves, but there is no unified attempt at classification. We develop a taxonomy so that clues of the same semantic function are grouped to assign one interpretation rule for the dominated proposition within the claim and evidence framework. Consider the following example: EX3: 1)The city needs help 2)All the roads are ruined 3)The buildings are crumbling 4)As a result, we are asking for federal support with the representation: The connective in 4, &amp;quot;as a result&amp;quot;, suggests that some prior proposition connects to 4 and that this proposition acts as evidence for 4. The relation of the prior proposition is set out below according the the interpretation rule for the category that &amp;quot;as a result&amp;quot; belongs to in the taxonomy. The particular evidence connection advocated here is of the form: &amp;quot;If our city needs help, then we will ask for federal aid&amp;quot;. iNote: Whether 1 is evidence for 4 is tested by trying a modus ponens major premise of the form: &amp;quot;(For all cities) if a 252 .he hybrid specifications. In EX5, however, a parallel construction is specifically indicated through clue words, so that the connections can be recognized by the hearer and the appropriate representation constructed as below: city needs help, then it can ask for federal aid&amp;quot;, and then using &amp;quot;our city&amp;quot; as the specific case). The taxonomy (drawn from [Quirk 72]) is intended to cover the class of connectives and presents default interpretation rules. (P indicates prior proposition; S has the clue) ,2 5 6 7 CATEGORY RELATION:P to S EXAMPLE parallel brother in addition detail father in particular inference son as a result summary multiple sons in sum reformulation father and son in other words contrast father or brother conversely Note that the classification of connectives provides a reduction in processing for the hearer. For example, in EX3 with a casual connective, the analysis for the proposition 4 is restricted to a search for a son. In short, connective interpretation rules help specify the type of relation between propositions; re—direction clues help determine which prior proposition is related to the current one. All together, clue words function to reduce overall processing operations. See Appendix II for more examples of relations of the taxonomy. IV Clues to support complex transmissions (Necessity) Clue words also exist in conjunction with transmissions which violate the constraints of the hybrid model of expected coherent structure. The claim is that clues provide a necessary reduction in complexity, to enable the hearer to recognize the intended structure. Consider the following examples: EX4: 1)The city is a mess 2)The parks are run down 3)The highways need revamping 4)The buildings are crumbling 5)The sandbox area is a mess EX5: 1)The city is a mess 2)The parks are run down 3)The highways need revamping 4)The buildings are crumbling 5)With regard to parks, the sandboxes are a mess 6)As for the highways, the gravel is shot 7)And as for the buildings, the bricks are rotting The initial tree for the argument is as follows: 1 2 3 4 In EX4, the last proposition cannot be interpreted as desired; the probable intended father proposition (2) is not an eligible candidate to relate to the current proposition (5) according to It now becomes important to provide a framework for accommodating &amp;quot;extended&amp;quot; transmission strategies in the model. First, the complexity of processing without clues is a good measure for determining whether a strategy should be considered exceptional. Then, to be acceptable in the model the proposed transmission must have some characterizable algorithm — i.e. still reflect a coherent plan of the speaker. Further, exceptional tranmsission strategies must be clearly marked by the speaker, using clues, in cases where the transmission can be assigned an alternate reading according to the basic processing strategy. The hearer should be expected to expend the minimum computational effort, so that the onus is on the speaker to make exceptional readings explicit. In brief, we propose developing a &amp;quot;clue interpetation module&amp;quot; for the analysis model, which would be called by the basic proposition analyzer to handle extended transmissions in the presence of clues. Then, complexity of processing should be used as a guide for determining the preferred analysis. To illustrate, consider another acceptable extended transmission strategy — mixed—mode sub—arguments, where evidence both precedes and follows a claim. EX6: 1)The grass is rotting 2)The roads are dusty 3)The city is a mess 4)In particular, the parks are a ruin Preferred rep: Other possible rep: 2 4 1 2 Here, it is preferable to keep 1 and 2 as evidence for 3, because this requires less computational than the re—attachment which takes place to construct the other possible representation. In other words, computational effort is a good guide for the specification of processing strategies. Finally, it is worth noting that the specific clue word used may influence the processing for these extended transmissions. In EX6, if the last proposition (4) was introduced by the clue word &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot;, then the alternate tree would not be an eligible reading. This is because &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; forces 4 to find a brother among the earlier propositions, according to the interpretation rule for the &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; class of the taxonomy of 253 connectives. In sum, we propose particular extended transmission strategies for the model, including (i) parallel (ii) mixed—mode (iii) multiple relations. [Note: More discussion of (iii) is in [Cohen 33]. We consider as an acceptable exceptional strategy the case where one proposition acts as evidence for an entire set of claims following it immediately in the stream. Other configurations of multiple relations seem to present additional processing problems]. We demand clue words to facilitate the analysis and we begin to suggest how to accommodate uses of these exceptional cases in the overall analysis model. V Related Topics A. Nature of clues The exact specification of a clue is a topic for further research. Since it is hypothesized that clues are necessary to admit exceptional transmissions, what constitutes a clue is a key issue. Within Quirk&apos;s classification of connectives ([Quirk 721) both special words and connecting phrases (&amp;quot;integrated markers&amp;quot;) are possible. For example, one may say &amp;quot;in conclusion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I will conclude by saying&amp;quot;. Quirk also discusses several mechanisms for indicating connectives which need to be examined more closely as candidates for clue words. These constructions are all &amp;quot;indirect&amp;quot; indications. a) lexical equivalence: This includes the case where synonyms are used to suggest a connection to a previous clause. For example: &amp;quot;The monkey learned to use a tractor. By age 9, he could work on the vehicle.&amp;quot;In searching for evidence relations, the hearer may faciltate his analysis by recognizing this type of connective device. But it unclear that the construction should be considered an additional &amp;quot;clue&amp;quot;. b) substitution, reference, comparison, ellipsis: Here, the &amp;quot;abbreviated&amp;quot; nature of the constructions may be significant enough to provide an extra signal to the hearer. For now, we do not consider these devices as clues, but examine the relations between the use of anaphors and clues in the next section. Even within the classification of connectives, there is a question of level of explicitness of the clues. Consider the example: EX7: 1)The city is dangerous 2a)I will now tell you why this is so 2b)The reason for the danger is... 2c)The reason is... 2d)The problem is ... 2a) is an explicit indication of evidence; b) and c) have a phrase indicating a causal connection, a kind of referent resolution as well; d) requires recognizing &amp;quot;the problem&amp;quot; as an indication of cause. The problem addressed in this example is similar to the one faced by Allen ([Allen 79]): handling a variety of surface forms which all convey the same intention. In our case, the &amp;quot;intention&amp;quot; is that one proposition act as evidence for another. Finally, there are different kinds of special phrases used to influence the credibilty of the expressions reflecting the speaker&apos;s beliefs and 2) expressions of emphasis. Since our model focuses on the first step in processing of recognizing structural connections, these clues have not be examined more closely. However, examples of these expressions are listed in Appendix III, along with phrases indicating structure. Relationto resolutionand focus There are some important similarities between our approach to reconstructing argument structure and the problem of representing focus for referent resolution addressed in LSidner 79] and LGrosz 77J. For both tasks, a particular kind of semantic relation between parts of a dialogue must be found and verified. In both cases, a hierarchical representation is constructed to hold structural information and is searched in some restricted fashion. Grosz&apos;s hierarchical model of focus spaces, with visibility constraints imposed by the task domain, is maintained in a fashion similar to our tree model. Information on which of the focus spaces is which are &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; (possible to shift to) is kept; open spaces are determined by the active space and the visibilty constraints. Analysis for a problem such as resolving definite noun phrase referents can be limited by choosing only those items &amp;quot;in focus&amp;quot;. 79] focus introduced to determine eligible candidates for a co—specification. But the ultimate choice rests with verification by the hearer, using inferencing, that the focus element relates to the anaphor. This is parallel to our approach of narrowing the search for a proposition&apos;s intepretation, but requiring testing of possible relations in order to establish the desired link. To set the focus, Sidner suggests using special words signal the hearer or 2) relying on shared knowledge to establish an unstated connection. This is analogous to our cases of processing with and without clues. In Sidner&apos;s theory there is also a clear distinction between returning to an element previously in focus (one from the focus stack) or choosing a completely &amp;quot;new topic&amp;quot; from prior elements (using the alternate focus list). We distinguish returning to some ancestor of the last proposition (a choice of eligible proposition) from the case of re—addressing a &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; proposition. 254 In this latter case, we require a clue word to re—direct. What we have tried to do is clearly separate eligible relatives from exceptional cases and connect the required use of clues to the exceptional category. Grosz and Sidner both allow &amp;quot;focus shifts&amp;quot; and Sidner explicitly discusses uses of &amp;quot;special phrases&amp;quot;, but we have tried to study the connections between clues and exceptions more closely. Finally, it is worth noting that the problem of reference resolution is similar to that of evidence determination, but still distinct. In the example below, constraints suggested by referent resolution theories should not be violated by our restricted processing suggestions: EX8: 1)The city is a mess 2)The park is ruined 3)The highway is run down 4)Every 3 miles, you find a pothole in it In 4, &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is resolved as referring to &amp;quot;the highway&amp;quot; in 3; this proposition is eligible and the closer connection is preferred. But clue interpretation is not equivalent to referent resolution. The clue &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; may be expressed as &amp;quot;one example for this is&amp;quot; but could also be presented as &amp;quot;one example for this problem is&amp;quot;. Since the search for a referent may differ according to the surface form ([Sidner 79]) there is no clear mapping from processing propositions with clues to those with referents. For our model, surface form may vary widely, but the search is restricted according to interpretation rules for a taxonomy — according to the semantics of the clue — and the solution is dictated by the structure of the argument so far. Necessityin the base case The main points raised in this paper are that clues can be used with a basic transmission strategy to cut processing and must be used in more complex transmissions. The question of whether certain basic transmissions still require clues is worth investigating further. In particular, it has been suggested (personal communication with psychologists) that deep stacks require clues to remind the hearer, due to &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; limitations. It may be productive to examine the computational properties of this situation more closely. Further, clues are often used to delineate sub—arguments when shifting topics. Again, some memory limitations for the hearer may be in effect here. VI Conclusion In conclusion, this paper outlines one crucial component of the computational model for argument analysis described in [Cohen 83]. It presents a first attempt at a solid framework for clue interpretation within argument understanding. The approach of studying goal—based dialogue and structure reconstruction also allows us to comment on the the function of clue words within analysis. The theory of clue interpretation gives insight into a known construction within sample dialogues; examining the computational properties provides a framework for design of the analysis model. It is important to note that there has been no effort to date to study the use of clue words extensively, distinguishing cases where they occur and suggesting when clues are necessary. The clue theory presented here also has possible implications for other application areas. For example, in resolving referents Sidner (LSidner 791) has suggested that clues will occur whenever the alternate focus list is consulted, beyond the focus stack default. Our claim is that the necessity for clues is closely tied to the complexity of processing and the reduction in processing operations afforded by the additional structural information provided by the clue words.</abstract>

<title confidence="0.818296">Appendix I: Coherent Transmission Strategies</title>
<abstract confidence="0.996436979674797">Coherent transmissions are illustrated and reception algorithms required to recognize these transmissions outlined. This material is first introduced in LCohen 81]. a)PRE-ORDER: state claim, then present evidence EXA1: 1)Jones would make a good president 1 2)He has lots of experience /\ 3)He&apos;s been on the board for 10 years 2 4 4)And he&apos;s honest I 1 5)He refused bribes while on the force 3 5 In the above example, each claim consistently precedes its evidence in the stream of propositions. b)POST-ORDER: present evidence, then state claim EXA2: 1)Jones has been on the board 10 years 5 2)He has lots of experience 3)And he&apos;s refused bribes 4)So he&apos;s honest 1 5)He would really make a good president 1 3 Here, the comparable example in post-order (where evidence precedes claim in the stream) is still coherent. The hearer can construct particular reception algorithms to recognize either of the transmission strategies. To interpret a current proposition in the case of pre-order transmission, the hearer must simply look for a father; in fact, the test is performed only on the last proposition and its ancestors, up the right border of the tree. In the algorithm makes use of stack to hold potential sons to the current proposition; the test is to be father to the top of the stack; if the test succeeds, all sons are popped and the resulting tree pushed onto the stack; if the test fails, the current proposition is added to the top of the stack. c)HYBRID: any sub-argument may be in preor postorder EXA3: 1)Jones would make a good president 1 2)He has lots of experience /&apos;\ 3)He&apos;s been on the board 10 years 2 5 he&apos;s refused bribes / he&apos;s honest The above example illustrates a coherent hybrid transmission. The hybrid reception algorithm is approximation to a general processing strategy used by the speaker. Essentially, the algorithm combines techniques from preand postorder reception algorithms, where both a father and sons for a current proposition must be found. The search is still restricted, as certain propositions are closed off as eligible relatives to the current one, according to the specifications of the hybrid transmission. There is an additional problem, due to the fact that evidence is treated as a transitive relation. Sons are to be attached to their immediate father; so, it may be necessary to relocate sons that have been attached initially to a higher ancestor. This situation is illustrated below: 2 3 5 Here, 4 an 5 would succeed as evidence for 1 (since they are evidence for 6 and 6 is evidence for 1); they will initially attach to 1 and relocate as sons to 6 when 6 attaches as son to 1. Here is an outline of the proposed hybrid reception algorithm. It makes uses of a dummy root node, for which all nodes are evidence. L is a pointer into the tree, representing the lowest node that can receive more evidence. For every node NEW in the input stream: forever do: if NEW evidence for L then if no sons of L are evidence for NEW then /* just test lastson for evidence*/ attach NEW below L set L to NEW exit forever loop else attach all sons of L which are evidence for L below NEW /* attach lastson; bump ptr. to lastson */ /* back 1 and keep testing for evidence */ attach NEW below L exit forever loop else set L to father (L) end forever loop APPENDIX II: Examples of Taxonomic Relations LCohen 81] first suggests using common interpretation rules for connectives in one category of a taxonomy. Various examples presented in that paper are included here as additional background. In the discussion below, S refers to the proposition with the clue; P refers to the prior proposition which connects to S. 1)Parallel: This category includes the most basic connectors like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; as well as lists of clues (e.g. &amp;quot;First, secondly, thirdly...&amp;quot;). P must be brother to S. Finding a brother involves locating the common father when testing evidence relations. 1)The city is in serious trouble 2)There are some fires going 2 4 separate blazes have broken out 4)In addition, a tornado is passing through 256 The parallel category has additional rules for cases where lists of clues are present. Then, propositions with clues from the same list must relate. But note that it is not always a brother relation between these specific propositions. In fact, the brothers are the propositions which serve as claims in each sub—argument controlled by a list clue. 1)The city is awful no one cleans the parks 3)So the parks are ugly \ 4)Then the roads are a mess 2 5 5)There&apos;s always garbage there 2 and 4 contain the clues; 4 are brothers. 2)Inference: There are clues like &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot; which directly indicate inferences being drawn. The classification of &amp;quot;result&amp;quot; covers cause and which contrasts another directly without evidence presented, is a (counter) claim, and hence S is a brother to P. EXA10: 1)The city&apos;s a disaster 1 -parks have uprooted trees 2 3)But at least the playground&apos;s safe EXA11: 1)The city is dangerous parks have muggers 4 3)But the city has no pollution 2 4)And there are great roads 5)So, I think the city&apos;s great In EXA10, the clue signals a son to higher claim; in EXA11, the clue connects two brother claims. APPENDIX III:Sample List of Clue Words This list is drawn from [Quirk 72]. Note that some words may belong to more than one category. effect relations which are of the form: if cause I Coinciding with the connective taxonomy 1: Parallel true then (most likely) effect true. Clues of this 1 first 17 on top of it all type are also included in the inference category. 2 second. .etc. 18 and what is more be son for S. 1)The fire destroyed half the city 2)People are homeless 2 3 secondly. .etc. 19 and 3)As a result, streets are crowded 4 next 20 neither.. .nor 5 then 21 either.. .or 3)Detail: Included in this category are clues of 6 finally 22 as well as example and particularization, where S lends 7 last 23 rather than partial support to P. Here, P will be father to S. 8 in the first place 24 as well 9 for one thing 25 too EXA7: 1)Sharks are not likeable 10 for a start 26 likewise 2)They are unfriendly to humans 2, 11 to begin with 27 similarly 3)In particular, they eat people 3 12 to conclude 28 equally 13 furthermore 29 again 4)Summary: Ordinarily, summary suggests that a set 14 moreover 30 also of sons are to be found. S is father to a set of 15 in addition 31 further P&apos;s. 16 above all EXA8: 1)The benches are broken iNote that 24-31 are appositions; 20 — 23 operate trails are choppy 1 2 clauses in one sentence]. 3)The trees are dying 4)In sum, the park is a mess 2: Summary 5)Reformulation: The taxonomy rule suggests looking for a prior proposition to be both father and son to the one with the clue. To represent this relation our tree model is inadequate. However, reformulations are often seen as additional evidence, adding detail and emphasis, and could then be recorded simply as sons to the prior statement. The example below suggests that interpretation: EXA9: 1)We need more money 1 other words, we are broke Note that additional discussion of the role of reformulation is included in [Cohen 83]. 6)Contrast: Although the notion of contrast is complex, for now we interpret a proposition which offers contrast to some evidence for a claim as providing (counter) evidence for that claim, and hence S is a son of P; likewise, a proposition [Note that 41 and 42 are whole phrases or &amp;quot;Integrated markers&amp;quot;J. 43 namely 45 that is to say 44 in other words 46 alternately 4: Detail 47 for example 49 another instance is 48 for instance 50 in particular 32 altogther sum 39 to conclude 34 therefore 40 to summarize 35 thus 41 I will sum by saying 36 all in all 42 My conclusion is conclusion 257 5: Inference 51 that is 57 if so 52 accordingly 58 if not 53 consequently 59 That implies 54 hence 60 I deduce from that 55 as a consequence 61 You can conclude from that 56 as a result [Note 57 and 58 operate between clauses within one sentence; 60 and 61 are whole phrases]. 6: Contrast 71 in any case 62 otherwise 72 at any rate 63 conversely 73 after all 64 on the contrary 74 in spite of that 65 in contrast 75 meanwhile 66 by comparison 76 rather than 67 however 77 I would rather say 58 nonetheless 78 The alternative is 69 though 70 yet [Note 77 and 78 are whole phrases].
