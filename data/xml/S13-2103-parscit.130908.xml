The domain of DDI identification is
constantly showing a rise of interest from
scientific community since it represents a
decrease of time and healthcare cost. In this
paper we purpose a new approach based on
shallow linguistic kernel methods to identify
DDIs in biomedical manuscripts. The
approach outlines a first step in the usage of
semantic information for DDI identification.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999332157894737">
In recent years a new discipline appeared in the
biomedical domain for processing pharmacological
manuscripts related to drug substances. This
discipline is the so called Pharmacovigilance, and
takes care of the management and control of Drug-
Drug interactions (DDI) among other faculties. A
DDI occurs when one drug influences the effect
level or activity of another drug.
Some events such as BioCreative1 and BioNLP2
establish a benchmark of comparison in the field of
natural language processing applied to biomedical
domain. This is the case of Semeval 2013:
Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from
BioMedical Texts3, where our system has been
evaluated.
The field of DDI extraction from biomedical
text has been faced from different perspectives
such as rule-based approaches, SVM approaches
and kernel-methods approaches, among others.

Segura-Bedmar et al. (2010) proposed an
approach to extract DDI from biomedical texts
based on Shallow Linguistic (SL) Kernel (Giuliano
et al., 2006) methods obtaining an F1 measure of
60,01%. The system was evaluated over a
DrugDDI dataset created in 2010 that contains 579
biomedical documents collected from the
pharmacological database DrugBank4. The dataset
contains a total of 3,160 DDIs.
Recently, the DDIExtraction2011 task5
compared the latest advances in Information
Extraction techniques applied to the DDI
identification. The event provided a benchmark
forum of 10 different approaches. The evaluation
of the systems was made over the DrugDDI
dataset. We now describe the most relevant works.
Thomas et al. (2011) developed a system by
combining a preprocessing phase based on
Charniak-Lease (Lease, Charniak, 2005) and
Stanford (Marneffe et al., 2006) parsers, with a
classification phase based on SL kernel (Giuliano
et al., 2006), k-Band Shortest Path Spectrum
(kBSPS) kernel (Airola et al., 2008), All Path
Graphic (APG) kernel (Tikk et al., 2010) and case-

techniques. The system obtained a F1 measure of
65.7%.
Chowdhury et al. (2011) presented a system
combining a preprocessing phase based on
Stanford parser and SPECIALIST (Browne, 2000)
lexicon tool, with a classification phase based on
Featured-Based kernel such as SL kernel and Tree-
Based kernel such as Dependency tree (DT) kernel
(Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and Phrase Structure
Tree (PST) kernel (Moschitti, 2004). The system
achieved an F1 of 63.7%.

Björne et al. (2011) proposed a different
approach by combining a preprocessing phase
based on a collection of features and n-grams; with
a classification based on support vector machine
(SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). The SVM methods
perform classification tasks by building
hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that
divide cases of different classes (binary
classification). The system yielded an F1 measure
of 62.99%.
Kernel methods seem to be the best choice for
extracting DDI since they obtained the highest
results. Thus, we decided to use kernel methods to
identify and classify DDI in our system.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that using semantic
features of pharmacological substances, can
provide valuable knowledge in the classification
phase. Therefore, we decide to integrate semantic
information in the classification process of kernel
methods.
In this paper we present a kernel-based approach
to identify and classify DDIs in biomedical text by
using SL kernels. In section 2 we describe the
system used for identifying DDIs. Section 3
present the results obtained by the system and a
little comparison with other approaches. In section
4 we expose some conclusions obtained and ideas
for future work.
2 Description of the systems
The system (see figure 1) is divided in three
phases: (i) in the first phase the system makes a
preprocessing of the documents in order to extract
grammatical and semantic information about each
word of the text. (ii) The second phase makes the
classification of whether a pair of drugs is a DDI or
not by using SL kernel methods. (iii) In the third
phase, the system classifies all DDIs into the
purpose type (advice, effect, mechanism, int) using
SL kernel methods.
The corpus is processed sentence by sentence,
using the identification tag provided for each
sentence.

approaches are based on different types of
information, our participation in the task will be
separated in two runs: first run will be based on
linguistic information and second run will be based
on semantic information.
Firstly, we process each sentence and obtain
linguistic information about part-of-speech (PoS)
tagging and lemmatization for each word contained
in the text. To do so we use the Stanford parser6 by
using the GATE analyzer7. The result of this step is
a list of words and PoS tags, but entity concepts
are missing. Therefore, we make a multiword
entities processing to keep the words related to the
same concept together. For example, the entity
beta-adrenergic receptor blocker is processed by
Stanford parser as three different annotations
nodes: beta-adrenergic as type JJ; receptor as type
NN; and blocker as type NNS. Thus we unify the
three words into an only one concept beta-
adrenergic_receptor_blocker as type NNP. This
information corresponds to the linguistic approach
of our participation in the task (see figure 2b).
On the other hand, we process the text and
collect semantic information about Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) identification for
each drug found in the text. The ATC code is a
widely used classification system provided from
WHO collaborating centre for Drug statistics
methodology. The classification divides drugs in
groups at five different levels according to the
organ or system on which they act, and their
therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical
properties. The system obtains the ATC code of
the drugs by searching the drug entities in the ATC
Index resource8. Then, we associate the ATC code
results with the drug entity. This information
corresponds to the semantic approach of our
participation in the task.

2.2 Identification of DDI
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999456090909091">
In this phase the system will predict whether a
pair of drugs is a DDI or not by the use of Shallow
linguistic Kernel methods. To do so we use the
jSRE tool9.
In one hand, the linguistic approach is based on
shallow linguistic information such as PoS tagging
and lemmatization. Therefore, the information
introduced into the SL kernel model consists of:
token_identifier, ATC_code, token_lemmatization,
POS_tag, entity_type and entity_label; as show in
figure 2b.
On the other hand, the semantic approach uses
the semantic information of drugs (ATC codes) to
increase the available knowledge in the kernel
classification process. To do so, we trained a SL
kernel model by replacing the token value with the
ATC code value. In case of a non-drug token, we
replace the token value with 0. This way the
information introduced to the SL kernel model
consists of: token_identifier, ATC_code,
token_lemmatization, POS_tag, entity_type and
entity_label; as show in figure 2c.

2.3 Type classification of DDI
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992823529412">
In the third phase, the system makes a
classification of DDIs to determine the type of the
interaction. To do so, the system face the
classification task as a machine learning task, and
use SL kernel methods. Hence, we train one SL
kernel model for each possible values of DDI type:
advice, effect, mechanism, int. To train the kernel
models we separate by type each DDI of the
training dataset. The result is four groups of
training dataset, where the correspondent type
class value are set to 1, and 0 otherwise. Once we
trained the kernel models, each DDI go through
four different prediction processes. The conflictive
cases are solved by frequency of appearance. This
step is the same for both linguistic and semantic
approach. Finally, we collect the results and
generate the task output format.

3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99963975">
The best result in DDI detection and classification
(macro-average score) were obtained by the
linguistic approach (run 2), achieving a F1 measure
of 0.534.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.998744">
Table 1: Results obtained by the system.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999715954545454">
Focusing on DDI detection results, we can see
that linguistic approach also overcome the
semantic approach, obtaining a F1 score of 0.676
and 0.537 respectively. This can be explained since
the SL kernel optimizes linguistic information
rather than semantic information. Therefore, ATC
code format is not appropriate for SL kernel.
However, the score obtained by the linguistic
approach using SL kernel with multiword entities
processing seems to be higher than the average
results obtained in DDIExtraction 2011 task. This
may be due to the great improvement that
DrugDDI corpus suffered since the last
competition, by enriching the information of each
entity.
Finally, we have a word to notice the decrease
of the results from DDI detection evaluation to
DDI detection and classification evaluation. This
could be due to the complexity of the DDI type
classification task. However, the final result of
macro-average score shows huge margin of
improvement.

4 Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999251294117647">
In this paper we present a kernel based approach to
identify and classify DDIs by using SL kernel. The
result obtained by the system achieves 0.534 F1
measure. From linguistic approach and semantic
approach purposed for the participation in the task,
the linguistic approach shows better results.
However, we can not discard semantic information
since we may have not used the appropriate
semantic information for a shallow linguistic
kernel.
Thus, a possible future work could be the
research in semantic information processing to
help in the classification process. Therefore,
another future work could be the integration of
pharmacological ontologies in the classification
process since they increase the knowledge
available for the classification task.

The SVM methods perform classification tasks by building hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that divide cases of different classes (binary classification). The system yielded an F1 measure of 62.99%. Kernel methods seem to be the best choice for extracting DDI since they obtained the highest results. Thus, we decided to use kernel methods to identify and classify DDI in our system. Furthermore, we hypothesize that using semantic features of pharmacological substances, can provide valuable knowledge in the classification phase. Therefore, we decide to integrate semantic information in th</context>
