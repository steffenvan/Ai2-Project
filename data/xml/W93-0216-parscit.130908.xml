Each utterance of a discourse either bears a semantic relation to a preceding utterance, or constitutes
the onset of a new semantic unit. Thus, a critical task in discourse understanding is determining how
to relate each new utterance to the current representation of the discourse. Sequences of semantically
related utterances are referred to as segments. The discourse intentions of the speaker provide one
basis for determining which utterances belong within one segment [Grosz and Sidner, 1986]. As
discussed in [Passonneau and Litman, 1993], we are conducting an empirical study of the relation
between discourse segments and intentions. We have established that naive subjects can reliably
identify the same discourse segment boundaries, using a commonsense notion of speaker intention as
the segmentation criterion. Briefly, Section 2 describes our study, and Section 3 presents our results
that agreement among subjects on discourse segment boundaries is highly statistically significant.
Taking these results as a starting point, we ask in Section 4 whether subjects also agree on the
intentions they associate with segments. Examination of our data suggests that subjects do agree on
the semantic labels they associate with segments. In Section 5 we discuss the question of how relations
among segments are recognized by looking at a class of cases in which an earlier suspended segment
is resumed (i.e., discourse pops). We hypothesize that in spontaneous oral discourse, relations among
segments are often not directly signaled, but must be inferred.

2 The Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974518">
Our corpus consists of 20 narrative monologues about the same movie (about 14,000 words total),
taken from Chafe&apos;s &amp;quot;Pear Stories&amp;quot; [Chafe, 1980]. Seven subjects per narrative were presented with
a verbatim transcript,1 such that each line of the transcript corresponded to one prosodic phrase
(sentence-final or phrase-final contour, see Chafe [1980] for details). Subjects were instructed to
identify sequential chunks,2 each representing a single intention. Subjects were also instructed to
describe the speaker intention for each discourse segment. Intention was explained in common sense
terms and by example. Subjects were restricted to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases. An
excerpt .from the instructions is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 2 illustrates a portion of an intention-based segmentation produced by 7 subjects. Distinct
subjects are indicated by letters of the alphabet. Prosodic phrases are numbered sequentially; the
We eliminated visually distracting material such as pause locations and durations.

&apos;Grosz and Hirschberg [1992] previously conducted an empirical study of hierarchical, intention-based segmentation.
We have looked at a simpler linear intention-based segmentation task. Our pilot study as well as the work of Rotondo
[1984] indicated that more complex segmentation tasks were too cumbersome given our average narrative length. Hearst
[1993] also examines linear segmentation, based on a notion of topic change.

3 Discourse Segment Boundaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999449176470588">
In [Passonneau and Litman, 1993], we show that our subjects agree with one another at levels
that are statistically significant, thus demonstrating the reliability of intention as a segmentation
criterion. Percent agreement is defined in [Gale et at., 1992] as the ratio of observed agreements with
the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion. We use percent agreement
to measure the ability of subjects to agree with one another on whether there is a segment boundary
between two adjacent prosodic phrases. We find that the average agreement across the 20 narratives
on the status of all potential boundary locations is 89% (with a range from 82%-92%). We then Use
Cochran&apos;s test [Cochran, 1950] to determine if these levels of agreement are statistically significant.
Cochran&apos;s test compares the observed number of subjects placing a boundary at every potential
site with the number predicted by a random distribution; it is assumed that the total number of
boundaries assigned by any one subject is given by that subject&apos;s actual performance. The greater
the difference from randomness, the more unlikely is the observed distribution. For the 20 narratives,
the probabilities of the observed boundary distributions ranged from p = .1 x 10-6 to p &lt; .6 x 10-9,
all very highly significant.
We also show why we consider boundaries agreed upon by a majority of subjects to be empirically
validated. By partioning Cochran&apos;s statistic, we find the threshold for significance across all subjects
and all narratives to be when at least 4 of 7 subjects agree. Using this threshold, we can derive a single

discourse segmentation for each narrative. For the excerpt in Figure 2, this gives two empirically
validated boundaries, represented as ordered pairs of prosodic phrases: (14.1,14.2) and (15.4,16.1).

4 Discourse Segment Intention
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983249210526316">
The 5 prosodic phrases from 14.2 through 15.4 constitute a segment, which we represent as [14.2,15.4].
From Figure 2, we see that 5 different subjects identified exactly this segment. Inspection of sub-
jects&apos; descriptions of speaker intention shows that in such cases of agreement on segments, subjects
also generally agree on the narrator&apos;s intentions for the segment. Figure 3 presents the intentions
attributed to the narrator by the 5 subjects for [14.2,15.4]. The 5 subjects who agreed on the seg-
ment (a-e) all indicate that the speaker&apos;s intentions pertain to describing the audio characteristics
of the movie. The other 2 subjects (f,g) included one or two preceding phrases in the segment (cf.
Figure 2). Subject f characterized the segment purpose as techniques used in the movie, and thus
identifies essentially the same intentional structure. Subject g, who began the segment with 13.1,
characterized the intention as when the boy falls no one else cares about him. Subject g thus not
only identifies a different segment boundary, but also a different overall purpose.
Presumably, the 5 subjects depicted in Figure 3 abstract from the fact that the three full clauses
in the segment all refer to auditory characteristics, as signaled by the lexical items conversation in
the first clause, sounds in the second, and say in the third. Here we have generalized further from
the subjects annotations to note that each asserts something about the movie&apos;s auditory character.
In general, for segments delimited by high agreement boundaries, a single formulation of speaker
purpose can be generalized from the data. provided by the 7 subjects. We believe that such data
provides evidence that when asked to, subjects perform the same kinds of abstraction across related
utterances described in [Polanyi, 1988] and elsewhere.

5 Discourse Segment Pops
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963736842105">
In Figure 2, one of the main characters of the movie (a, boy on a bicycle) is referred to in phrases 13.1
and 14.1. The speaker suspends her description of the boy&apos;s activities throughout the next segment
([14.2,15.4]), but resumes reference to the boy in the first utterance of the following segment (16.1)
using a third person definite pronoun subject (he). This illustrates a specific class of discourse pops,
in which a segment resumes an earlier suspended segment. In particular, this class of resumption
segments begins with an utterance in which a third person definite pronoun refers to an entity that is
not in the focus space [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] associated with the intervening segment. Processing
a clause that signals this type of discourse pop involves several tasks. Resolving the pronoun in the
initial clause of the resumption segment requires shifting the attentional state [Grosz and Sidner,
1986], since the active focus space (corresponding to the intervening segment) does not contain a
representation of the referent. This shift depends on recognizing the termination of the intervening
segment, and a continuation relation between the resumption aud suspended segments, so that the
entities in focus in the suspended segment are again in focus for the resumption segment.
There are 8 discourse pops of the type in Figure 2 in the 10 narratives that we have coded for
referential relations (coding described in [Pa.ssonneati, 1993]). These 8 examples exhibit various
structural and semantic relations to the presumed discourse model. For example, they contain
intervening segments that provide more detail, provide general background, or are digressions. In 7
cases, the resumption segment begins with a word that can function as a cue word,3 but in 4 cases
the cue word is and, a word whose discourse -usage is hard to distinguish and which provides very

little semantic information. The cue words in the remaining 3 cases are so, all right and then, none
of which clearly signal attentional change [Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993].
Non-lexical signals (e.g., uh, tsk, false starts) precede the initial clause of the resumption segment
in 5 cases, and relatively long pauses (&gt; 1.5 sec.) in 6 (cf. [Hirschberg a,nd Grosz, 1992]). This
suggests that in spontaneous oral discourse, instead of giving explicit indicators of the structural
and semantic relations among segments, speakers provide non-lexical and pausal cues to breaks in
segmental structure, relying on the hearer to infer the abstract structural and semantic relations.
For example, the semantics of the predication fall over at the onset of the resumption segment is
arguably very dissimilar to the predications occurring in the intervening segment, possibly supporting
the inference that the new clause is unrelated to the intervening segment. In contrast, the two
clauses which end the suspended segment (at 14.1) and begin the resumption segment (at 16.1)
are semantically identical and structurally parallel, supporting the inference that 16.1 resumes the
segment containing 14.1.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999702">
Our study establishes that a naive notion of speaker intention serves as a reliable criterion for
identifying discourse segments. Qualitative analysis of annotations of speaker intention supports
the conclusion that where subjects agree on segment boundaries, they also agree on the segment&apos;s
intention. Using the empirically validated segments, we can begin to ask specific questions about the
relation between segments and their abstract representation in an evolving discourse model. We note
that for spontaneous oral narrative, discourse pops may not be explicitly signaled by cue words, and
that structural and semantic relations among distinct segments may instead require inference. In
[Passonneau and Litman, 1993], we directly address how explicit devices such as pauses, cue words
and referential noun phrases correlate with segmental structure in order to posit constraints between
surface structure choices and intentional and segmental structure.
