This paper describes the participation of
the SINAI research group in Task 4 of the
2014 edition of the International Work-
shop SemEval. This task is concerned
with Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
and its goal is to identify the aspects of
given target entities and the sentiment ex-
pressed towards each aspect.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954872333333334">
The web has evolved progressively since its be-
ginning in 1990. At first, the user was almost a
passive subject who received the information or
published it, without many possibilities to gener-
ate an interaction. The emergence of the Web 2.0
was a social revolution, because it offered users
the possibility of producing and sharing contents,
opinions, experiences, etc.
Some years ago it was common to ask family
and friends to know their opinion about a particu-
lar topic, but after the emergence of the Web 2.0,
the number of Internet users has been greatly in-
creased. The exponential growth of the subjective
information in the last years has created a great in-
terest in the treatment of this information.
Opinion Mining (OM), also known as Senti-
ment Analysis (SA) is the discipline that focuses
on the computational treatment of opinion, sen-
timent and subjectivity in texts (Pang and Lee,
2008). Currently, OM is a trendy task in the field
of Natural Language Processing due mainly to the
fact of the growing interest in the knowledge of
the opinion of people from different sectors of the
society. However, the study on Opinion Mining
goes back to 2002 when two of the most cited arti-

cles in this task were published (Pang et al., 2002)
(Turney, 2002).
OM or SA can be divided into two subtasks
that are known as subjectivity classification and
polarity classification. Subjectivity classification
is the task concentrated on the identification of
subjectivity in texts, that is, these systems are bi-
nary classifiers that separate the documents in two
classes, objective and subjective ones. On the
other hand, polarity classification is the task of de-
termining the semantic orientation of a subjective
text. The ideal OM system has to be composed
by a subjectivity classifier and a polarity classifier.
However, most of the works in the field of OM are
carried out considering the documents as subjec-
tive, so polarity classification systems have been
more studied than subjectivity classification ones.
The reader can find a complete overview about the
research in OM in (Pang and Lee, 2008) and (Liu,
2012).
As Liu asserts in (Liu, 2012), the polarity clas-
sification systems can be divided into three levels:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992496235294118">
• Document level polarity classification:
This kind of systems assumes that each doc-
ument expresses an opinion on a single entity
(Pang et al., 2002) (Turney, 2002).
• Sentence level polarity classification: In
this case the polarity classification systems
are focused on the identification of the level
of polarity of each sentence of the docu-
ment (Wilson et al., 2005) (Yu and Hatzivas-
siloglou, 2003).
• Entity and Aspect level polarity classifi-
cation: These systems accomplish a finer-
grained sentiment classification. Whereas the
document-level and sentiment-level only dis-
cover the overall sentiment expressed by the
author, the goal of the entity and aspect po-
larity classification is the identification of the

sentiment of the author towards each entity or
aspect.
An entity usually is composed by several as-
pects, for example a telephone is formed by a
headset, which also consists of a speaker and an
earphone. An entity can be regarded as a hierarchy
of all the aspects whose head is the entity, so the
entity can also be considered as an aspect or gen-
eral aspect. Therefore, the task “entity and aspect
level polarity classification” can be called “aspect
polarity classification”.
The main objective of OM at aspect level is to
discover every quintuple (ei, aij, sijkl, hk, tl) in
a given document, where ei is the entity, aij is
one of the aspects of the entity or the entity and
sijkl is the orientation of the opinion expressed
by the opinion holder hk in a certain moment tl.
To achieve the objective of populate the quintu-
ple is needed the splitting of the task into several
subtasks that correspond with the identification of
the aspect, the author or the holder of the opinion
and the moment when the opinion is expressed or
posted. But in a real scenario, OM at aspect level
is also limited like OM at sentence and document
level, and most of the research works are only fo-
cused on the identification of the aspect and in the
calculation of the level of intensity of the senti-
ment stated about the aspect. However, there are
some papers that are closely to the goal of finding
out each of the components of the quintuple (Kim
and Hovy, 2004) (Kim and Hovy, 2006).
The task four of the 2014 edition of SemEval
workshop aims to promote the research polarity
classification systems at aspect level. The task is
divided into four subtasks, two of them related to
the aspect identification and the other with the po-
larity classification. Due to the fact that OM is a
domain-dependent task, the organization proposes
the four subtasks in two different domains, Restau-
rants and Laptops. Task one and three are the
ones linked to the aspect identification. Subtask
one is focused on the identification of the aspects
in each review of the two given corpus. Subtask
three goes one step further, in which the main ob-
jective is for a given predefined set of aspect cate-
gories, identify the aspect categories discussed in
the given sentence. Subtask two proposes the clas-
sification of the sentiment expressed by the author
about each of the aspects extracted, and subtask
four has as challenge the classification of the po-
larity of each of the categories of the aspects. A
wider description of the task and the datasets used
can be found in the task description paper (Pontiki
et al., 2014).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section two outlines the two main parts of our pro-
posed system, firstly the strategy to solve the sub-
task 1 and 2 and then the method used to resolve
the subtask 3 and 4. To sum up the paper, an anal-
ysis of the results and the conclusion of this work
are shown in section three and four respectively.

The guidelines of this task indicate that each team
may submit two runs: constrained (using only the
provided training data and other resources, such as
lexicons) and unconstrained (using additional data
for training). We decided to follow an unsuper-
vised approach that we present below.
Our system is divided into two subsystems (Fig-
ure 1). The aim of the first subsystem is to extract
the aspect terms related to a given target entity
(subtask 1) and calculate the sentiment expressed
towards each aspect in the opinion (subtask 2).
The goal of the second is, for a given set of cat-
egories, to identify the categories discussed in the
review (subtask 3) and determine its polarity (sub-
task 4).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937133333333">
To identify the aspects related with the target en-
tity (laptops or restaurants) we decided to use
a bag of words built from all the aspect terms
present in the training data. But this method
only detects previously tagged aspect in the train-
ing data, so, we enriched the list of words with
data automatically extracted from the collabora-
tive knowledge base Freebase1, in order to im-
prove the identification. For this, we obtained
all categories in restaurants domain and in com-
puters domain2 (types in a domain) using MQL3
(Metaweb Query Language) (Figure 2).
Then, for each domain category we extracted all
terms (instances of a type) to enrich the bag. In
Figure 3 we can see an example to get all terms of

2Nowadays, Freebase has more than 70 different domains.
But, for this task, we are only interested in these two.
3MQL is a language which is used to express Metaweb
queries. This allows you to incorporate knowledge from the
Freebase database into your own applications and websites.

In this way, given a review of the test data, the
first step is to tokenize it to get a vector of uni-
grams with all single words in the text (we do not
divide the reviews into sentences because there is
only one sentence per review). The second step
is to represent each review as a list of n lists of
unigrams, bigrams, ... , n-grams where n is the
number of tokens in the sentence. This is because
an aspect term can be a nominal phrase, a word
formed from a verb but functioning as a different
part of speech (e.g. gerunds and participles) or a
simple term. For example, the review “The salad
was excellent as was the lamb chettinad” is repre-
sented as shown in Figure 4.
After obtaining the possible terms of a review,
the next step is to go over the list of lists to ex-
tract the aspects. Each list is traversed backwards
matching each term with each aspect from the bag.
When an aspect is found or the top of the list is
reached the search begins in the next list. In the
review showed in Figure 4, the system will iden-
tify two aspects: salad and lamb chettinad. The
search in this example begins in the list 1 with
“The salad was excellent as was the lamb chetti-
nad”, ends with “The” and continues with the next
list, because the top of the list is reached. The
search in the list 2 begins with “salad was excel-
lent as was the lamb chettinad”, ends with “salad”
because it is an aspect and continues with the list
3 and so on. At last, the search in the list 8 be-
gins with the term “lamb chettinad”, ends with it
because it is an aspect presents in the bag of words
and continues with the list 9.
Once extracted the aspects related with the tar-
get entity, the next step is to determine the words
that modify each aspect. For this, we have used
the Stanford Dependencies Parser4. This parser

was designed to provide a simple description of
the grammatical relationships in a sentence that
can easily be understood and effectively used by
people without linguistic expertise who want to
extract textual relations (De Marneffe and Man-
ning, 2008). It represents all sentence relation-
ships uniformly as typed dependency relations. In
this work, we have considered the main relation-
ships for expressing opinion about an aspect: us-
ing a verb (“nsubj” or “nsubjpass”), an adjectival
modifier (“amod”) or a dependency relation with
another word (“dep”). In the review “The salad
was excellent as was the lamb chettinad”, the sys-
tem will identify two modifiers words: the ad-
jective excellent that expresses how is the salad
through the relationship “nsubj” and the adjective
excellent that also modified the aspect lamb chet-
tinad through the relationship “dep” Figure 5.
To determine the sentiment expressed over an
aspect we have calculated the polarity of each
word that modifies it through a voting system
based on three classifiers: Bing Liu Lexicon (Hu
and Liu, 2004), SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al.,
2010) and MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005). The Bing
Liu Lexicon is a list of 2006 positive words and
another with 4783 negative ones. MPQA is also
a subjectivity lexicon with positive and negative
words and has extra information about each one:
the part-of-speech, the strength, etc. Finally, Sen-
tiWordNet is a lexical resource that assigns to each
synset of WordNet three sentiment scores: positiv-
ity, negativity and objectivity. Therefore, an aspect
is positive/negative if there are at least two clas-
sifiers that tag it as positive/negative and neutral
in another case. It may happen that a word is af-
fected by negation, to treat this problem we have
used a straightforward method, the fixed window
size method. We have considered the negative par-
ticles: “not”, “n’t”, “no”, “never”. So if any of the
preceding or following 3 words to one aspect is
one of these negative particles, the aspect polarity
is reversed (positive —&gt; negative, negative —&gt;
positive, neutral —&gt; neutral).
In the example showed in Figure 5, the aspect
salad is modified by the word excellent that also
modified the aspect lamb chettinad. This adjective
is part of the Bing Liu positive list, MPQA classi-
fies it as positive and SentiWordNet assigns it the
scores: 1 (positivity), 0(objectivity), 0 (objectiv-
ity). Then, the aspects salad and lamb chettinad
are classified as positive by the voting system.

2.2 Subsystem 2: Categories Identification
and Polarity Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982096774194">
As we have mentioned above, this subsystem fo-
cuses on the treatment of the categories and has
been used only with the dataset of restaurants.
On the one hand, we have built a bag of words
for each of the given categories related to the tar-
get entity (restaurants). We have tagged manu-
ally each aspect of the bag of words, built for the
first subsystem, in one of the categories of the
given set (food, service, price, ambience, anec-
dotes/miscellaneous). Thus, to determine the cat-
egories that are referenced in a review we have
searched each aspect identified with the first sub-
system in each bag, if the aspect belongs to any
category then this category is identified. If any as-
pect belongs to a category, then the category allo-
cated is “anecdotes/miscellaneous”.
On the other hand, the sentiment expressed
about each category has been calculated as the
most frequent polarity of the aspects that belongs
to this category. In case of a tie between positive
and negative values, the polarity value conflict is
assigned to the category. If any aspect belongs to
the category, then the polarity value of the review
is assigned to the category.
In the above example, the aspects salad and
lamb chettinad belong to food’s bag of words, so
that the system will identify that the category food
is discussed in this review and will assign it the
polarity value positive, because the sentiment ex-
pressed about the two aspects that belongs to this
category is positive.

3 Analysis of the results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997608125">
The aim of this section is to provide a meaningful
report of the results obtained after participation in
the task related to Aspect Based Sentiment Anal-
ysis (ABSA). Table 1 shows the evaluation results
for the aspect extraction subtask. As we can see,
the recall overcomes the mean value of results of
participants in both domains (laptops and restau-
rants), that is, the system identifies quite aspects
of the corpus. However, the precision is lower
because the system identifies aspects that are not
considered by the organization, due to the fact that
our bag of words contains more aspects than the
tagged by the organization.
The results reached in the aspect term extraction
subtask are similar (Table 2). It should be taken
into account that the system is a general-domain

knowledge for each of the domains. This fact can
be shown in the results reached in the task of po-
larity classification for the two domains, which are
similar. Therefore, this subtask could be improved
by taking into account the domain and other rela-
tionships for expressing opinion about an aspect
apart from that we have treated (“nsubj”, “nsubj-
pass”, “amod”, “dep”).

In SA can be differentiated three levels of study of
a text: document level, sentence level and aspect
level. The document level analysis determines the
overall sentiment expressed in a review, while the
sentence level analysis specifies for each sentence
of a text, whether express a positive, negative or
neutral opinion. However, these two types of anal-

ysis do not reach the level of detail that an user
wants when searches for information about a prod-
uct. The fact that the overall sentiment of a prod-
uct is positive does not mean that the author has a
positive opinion about all aspects of that product,
or the fact that is negative does not involve that
everything about the product is bad.
In addition, the large amount of sources and
the high volume of texts with reviews, make dif-
ficult for the user to select information of interest.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop classification
systems at aspect level that help users to make de-
cisions and, on the other hand, that show compa-
nies the opinion that consumers have about their
products, in order to help them to decide what to
keep, what to delete and what to improve.
In this paper we have presented our first ap-
proach for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
that has been developed for the task four of the
2014 edition of SemEval workshop. After analyz-
ing the evaluation results we consider that is pos-
sible to introduce some improvements we are cur-
rently working: domain adaptation in the polarity
calculation, consideration of other relationships
to determine which words modify an aspect and
treatment of negation (in the system proposed we
have used the fixed window size method). Also, in
a near future we will try to extrapolate it to Span-
ish reviews.

MPQA is also a subjectivity lexicon with positive and negative words and has extra information about each one: the part-of-speech, the strength, etc. Finally, SentiWordNet is a lexical resource that assigns to each synset of WordNet three sentiment scores: positivity, negativity and objectivity. Therefore, an aspect is positive/negative if there are at least two classifiers that tag it as positive/negative and neutral in another case. It may happen that a word is affected</context>

The exponential growth of the subjective information in the last years has created a great interest in the treatment of this information. Opinion Mining (OM), also known as Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the discipline that focuses on the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in texts (Pang and Lee, 2008). Currently, OM is a trendy task in the field of Natural Language Processing due mainly to the fact of the growing interest in the knowledge of the opinion of people from different sectors of the society.

A wider description of the task and the datasets used can be found in the task description paper (Pontiki et al., 2014). The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
