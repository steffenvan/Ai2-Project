1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866">
While communicative intention certainly plays a role in language generation, we have found that there is a
need for textual and rhetorical relations as well in our document generation system, PLANDoc. PLAN-
Doc will produce multi-page narratives describing the activities of telephone network planning engineers.
These narratives will be read by managers and auditors as well as other planning engineers.
Since the reports contain summaries, sometimes determining what information to include and how to
organize it is based solely on textual constraints. Summaries must be concise and information can be
packed in using constructions such as ellipsis, conjunction and modification. Thus, textual constraints that
rely on syntactic structure, lexical information, and parallels in the semantic types of the underlying infor-
mation must play a role in organizing a summary.
Since the intended audience of the narratives is broad, we often need to determine what information to
include in the narrative based on general presentational factors that aim to improve the clarity of the text.
Rhetorical relations are useful for modelling this sort of constraint.
There are also cases where it is necessary to communicate the planning engineer&apos;s intent in taking a
specific action. However, we cannot model this computationally since we have no access to information
about intention. While we cannot automatically generate information based on intent, we do allow the
engineer to enter statements that describe her reasons for an action. These user-authored statements can
be interspersed with machine-generated text.
In the following sections, we first give some background on the PLANDoc system and the narratives that
we are aiming to generate. We follow this with examples that illustrate why different types of constraints
are needed in determining the content and organization of a PLANDoc narrative. All examples are taken
from a set of narratives written by an experienced planning engineer for actual runs of the underlying
planning system that PLANDoc is based on.

2. PLANDoc Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999532">
Currently, planning engineers use a powerful software tool, the PLAN system, that helps them derive
20-year relief plans optimizing the timing, placement and cost of new facilities in a route in the telephone
network. Documentation of relief plans is needed to justify their implied expenditures to managers,
auditors, and regulators as well as to provide a record of the engineer&apos;s reasoning for future network
studies. PLANDoc will generate documentation using a trace of an engineer&apos;s interaction with PLAN.
Given a model of the current configuration of a route along with ftwecasts of future service demands, the
planning engineer first calls upon PLAN to generate a Base relief plan for the route. Although the Base
plan is the most economical long-term solution, it generally needs to be refined to account for practical
and intangible factors known to the engineer but unknown to the computer. For example, the engineer
may need to postpone the placement of equipment in a certain CSA (Carrier Serving Area) due to a fixed
cap on near-term expenditures, or she may decide to activate DLC (Digital Loop Carrier) equipment in
another CSA because small manholes in that area make the placement of additional copper cables imprac-
tical. For this reason PLAN includes a powerful Interactive Refinement Module that allows the engineer
to do &apos;what-if modeling to explore the effects of various refinements to the Base plan. The engineer
draws upon her expertise to determine what refinements to try, often including some that she fully expects

to be sub-optimal, if only for the purpose of proving the point to managers, auditors and regulators. In the
end, some subset of refinements is selected as the final Proposed Relief Plan.

3. PLANDoc Narratives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998815">
We employed an experienced planning engineer to write sample PLANDoc narratives based on actual
PLAN runs. These manually-written narratives serve as models for our system development. The open-
ing and closing paragraphs of PLANDoc narratives are summaries of the Base Plan and the final Proposed
Relief Plan. The main body of PLANDoc narratives is a sequence of one-paragraph descriptions of each
refinement scenario the engineer chooses to include. In addition to the machine-generated refinement
paragraphs, the engineer is given the opportunity to enter a manually-written Engineer&apos;s Note for each
refinement. The purpose the Engineer&apos;s Note is to provide motivation or to describe the reasoning behind
the refinement. Thus, the main body of the narrative consists of alternating refinement paragraphs and
engineering notes.
The Engineer&apos;s Notes are clearly meant to communicate intentions. In contrast, we have observed that
some of our model refinement paragraphs (to be generated automatically): 1) appear to be organized by
textual relations that govern their discourse structure; 2) include sentences that seem to be motivated by
rhetorical relations; and 3) include sentences that require access to communicative goals in order to be
generated. We provide examples of each.

3.1. Evidence of Textual Constraints in PLANDoc Paragraphs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997688">
In the following refinement paragraph, 8 messages have been grouped together based on textual con-
straints. Because of the similarity of each individual message and resulting sentence, the messages can be
combined using conjunction to produce a very concise sentence.

1) This refinement demanded the following changes: denied DLC activations to CSA 2119, 2653, 2755,
and 2757; used a cutover strategy of &amp;quot;ALL&amp;quot; for CSA 2605 and 2713; changed the &amp;quot;ALL&amp;quot; DLC system to
&amp;quot;id1c96&amp;quot; for CSA 2605; and demanded DLC activation for CSA 2651 in 1994Q1.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950438133333333">
In a second summary example shown below, the sentence in italics appears to have been placed in this
position based on its relation to the previous sentences. In the body of the narrative, the date is usually
included with each separate activation. To generate a summary like this, PLANDoc would have to note
that it could group a series of activations initially and delay mentioning the date since it can refer back to
them using a phrase such as &amp;quot;All these new activations.&amp;quot; Such a decision can only be opportunistically
based on similarities between data that can be grouped together and the available of an appropriate means
for referring back to them.
2) The BASE plan for this route called for activating new DLC sites with fiber T- l support in CSA 2117,
CSA 2651, CSA 2105, CSA 2113, CSA 2115, CSA 2703, CSA 2755 and CSA 2757. DLC activations
with copper conditioned pairs for T-1 support included CSA 2119, CSA 2653, CSA 2713, CSA 2523 and
CSA 2451. Fiber was activated to CSA 2605. All these new activations are in the first 10 years of the
study.
The use of constraints such as these thr organizing content, which are opportunistically based on the
surrounding text, seem only remotely related to rhetorical relations and communicative intentions, at least
relative to the following examples. Such constraints are more textual in nature.

3.2. Evidence of Rhetorical Structure Relations in PLANDoc Paragraphs

<bodyText confidence="0.9445975">
Unlike the previous examples, some PLANDoc narrative paragraphs include sentences that appear to be
motivated by rhetorical structure relations. Examples include the following:

<listItem confidence="0.63368875">
3) This refinement demanded that fiber be activated to CSA 2907 in 1996. This CSA was activated for
DLC in 1994Q4 in RUNID &apos;dlc_2907&apos;.
4) This refinement denied activation of CSA 2119 and CSA 2120 (the 2 DLC sites activated in the BASE
plan).
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.940566">

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.83794">
5) This refinement demands DLC activation of CSA 2551 in 1996 with 40 pairs cutover from copper to
DLC at that time. CSA 2551 was activated in 1997 in the BASE plan with no cutover.
6) This refinement denied the new DLC activation in the BASE plan of CSA 4704.

<bodyText confidence="0.999783545454546">
These paragraphs require intelligent content planning because the italicized sentences refer not to actions
in the current refinement scenario but to actions in some previous scenarios, in the Base plan or input data.
Their underlying propositions are not among those passed to the text generator for the current refinement
paragraph. Hence, a content planner capable of exploiting factors such as rhetorical relations is needed in
order to seek out those propositions for inclusion. We take the rhetorical structure relation underlying all
of the above examples to be that of CONTRAST since in each case the italicized sentence explicitly
contrasts old information with new information.
One might surmise that the author had the communicative goal of calling the reader&apos;s attention to the
contrast between the actions in the current refinement and previous information. However, for implemen-
tation purposes it seems sufficient for the content planning module to operate based on the inferred
rhetorical relation of CONTRAST.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999179">
3.3. Evidence of Communicative Intentions in PLANDoc Paragraphs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965069875">
Although intentional relations are evident in the previous examples, it can be characterized as a general
intention that might be attributed to any author. There is nothing specific to the individual planning situa-
tion that causes the information to be added as in every report the difference between new refinements and
the base plan must be clear. Thus, existing rhetorical relations are sufficient to make computational im-
plementation possible. In contrast, the following examples embody some intentional relations that are
beyond our capacity to implement.
7) This refinement activates CSA 4111 for DLC in 1994(24. CSA 4111 was activated in 1997 in the BASE
plan and 24 gauge cable was placed in section 4109 in 1994Q.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.525464" genericHeader="method">
ENGR NOTE: This is an attempt to defer/eliminate the coarse gauge cable. It doesn&apos;t.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953414866666667">
8) This refinement demands the activation of fiber to CSA 2168b in 1996 and to CSA 2115 in 1994Q4.
These fiber activations eliminate manhole rebuilds in sections 2111, 2112 and 2115. Ducts and coarse
gauge cable in sections 2165 and 2117 are also eliminated or deferred. Plus, they get fiber turned up in
business areas at a lower cost than serving the DLC on copper.
The first example includes both the refinement paragraph and the its accompanying engineering note. In
both examples, neither the italicized nor the bold sentences refer to actions in the current refinement
scenario, so all would require the effort of an intelligent content planner in order to be included.
Note that the italicized sentences in these examples are similar to the ones in the previous examples in that
an intelligent content planner could exploit the rhetorical relation CONTRAST as a basis for their inclu-
sion. The bold sentences are far more problematic in that their only basis for inclusion appears to be a
communicative intention that can only be revealed in an engineering note. Note also that the communica-
tive intention is related to a domain-specific telephone engineering principle. This principle is specific to
the current planning problem and not to all planning problems. Unless we can discover and explicitly
represent a finite set of such principles, it will not be possible to include such sentences in our machine-
generated refinement paragraphs.

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988166666667">
In written reports such as the ones PLANDoc will generate, communicative intent is not sufficient for
determining the content and organization of the report. Since the audience is broad and planning scenarios
are numerous, we cannot reason about the individual intentions and knowledge of writer and reader in
determining what should go into the report. Often knowledge about the general kind of information that is
needed is sufficient for determining what to include. This can be implemented using rhetorical relations.

tent. However, this capability seems crucial when summaries are required.
