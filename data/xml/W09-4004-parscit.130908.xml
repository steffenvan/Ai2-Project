In this paper we present a versatile language processing tool
that can be successfully used for many Balkan languages. For
its work, this tool relies on several sophisticated textual and
lexical resources that have been developed for most Balkan
languages. These resources are based on several de facto
standards in natural language processing.

<bodyText confidence="0.999956022727273">
The software tool WS4LR (shortened for WorkStation for
Language Resources) has been developed by the Language
Technology Group organized at the Faculty of
Mathematics for several years now. Its first version was
introduced in 2004 [8] and it dealt mainly with
harmonizing various heterogeneous lexical resources.
Subsequently, many new features have been added,
particularly those that have helped in the production and
exploration of aligned texts on the basis of the lexical
resources incorporated [9]. The new tool WS4QE
(shortened for Work Station for Query Expansion) was
developed on the basis of WS4LR that enables the
expansion of queries submitted to the Google search engine
[10]. The integrated lexical resources enable modifications
of users’ queries for both monolingual and multi lingual
searches.
When presenting WS4LR and WS4QE, we have
always stressed that, although they have been mainly used
for Serbian, they are by no means language dependent as
long as compatible lexical resources exist for any two
languages. Nevertheless, the full potential of these tools
was until now used only for Serbian, and in bilingual
context, for Serbian and English.
In this paper we will show that the tools WS4LR and
WS4QE are truly independent both from Serbian, for
which they were initially developed, and from English
which seems to be in the background of many natural
language processing tools. The main presupposition for the
usage of these tools for other languages is the existence of
textual and lexical resources developed in the same
methodological framework. Since this prerequisite has
been satisfied for Bulgarian, and, to some extent, for some
other Balkan languages (Greek, Romanian, etc...), we will
therefore show that WS4LR and WS4QE can be
successfully used for these languages.
WS4LR, written in C#, is organized in modules which
perform different functions. The core of the system
WS4LR_Core comprises four .Net libraries, used by two
components: the stand-alone windows application
WS4LR.exe and the web service wsQueryExpand.asm.
Web application WS4QE.asp manages user query request,
than uses web service in order to expand user query,
submits the expanded query to Google search engine and
finally presents retrieved result.

In order to prove the usability of WS4LR and WS4QE for
languages other than Serbian and English, we have used
various resources, both textual and lexical. In the following
sections we will briefly present these resources, what
methodological framework was used for their development,
and how they were integrated for their successful usage.

2.1 Textual Resources – Aligned Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999196">
The aligned texts as a special form of multilingual corpora
were the focus of many projects in the past few decades. A
systematic approach to the development of multilingual
corpora was initiated within the Multext project, which
subsequently included East-European languages through
the Multext-East project [5]. In the meantime, many
multilingual corpora have been compiled from large
corpora, usually fully automatically prepared, which have a
range comprised from texts in the limited technical domain
[18] to more versatile literary corpora [5] that are often
more modest in size but minutely prepared.
The main textual resource used to explore WS4LR is
Jules Verne’s novel Around the World in Eighty Days. This
text was chosen for various reasons. First of all, the text is
available in digital form for the majority of European
languages, including Balkan languages. Regarding its
content, it represents a suitable text for different types of
analysis, especially in the domain of named entity
recognition (geographical concepts and different
measures). Besides this, it has already been used for some
interesting research, e.g. multi-word tagging [13] and
building models for machine translation [21]. Finally, from
a practical point of view, its suitability stems from the fact
that it presents a sample text for the French distribution of
the Unitex system [15].

Versions of the novel in fifteen different languages
have been acquired, but not all of these texts have yet been
aligned. Among the already aligned texts are the French
original and translations in English and four Balkan
languages – Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek, and Romanian.
In the preparatory phase each translation was marked
in accordance with the TEI-standard in XML, and the title
(&lt;head&gt;), paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) and segments (&lt;seg&gt;) were
included as units of a text logical layout. At the beginning
of the alignment process, all segments coincided with
sentences automatically tagged by Unitex. The XAlign
system [1] was used for the alignment process. Starting
from the French version, the goal of the alignment was to
establish 1:1 relations with all other languages on the
segmental level. In order to achieve this goal and after
manually checking all aligned segments, some of them had
to be divided into smaller units, and some were grouped
into larger units. Thus, we arrived at the total of 4,409
segments in all texts. This way, the missing segments or the
inconsistencies between the source text and its translations
were identified in most of the cases. In the following
example the English segment is given only for the sake of
translation.

2.2 Morphological Dictionaries in LADL
Format
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996230769231">
Morphological dictionaries are a necessary resource in
various phases of the automatic analysis of a text. The tool
WS4LR expects morphological dictionaries to be in the
format known as DELAS/DELAF presented in [2] that was
developed in LADL (Laboratoire d&apos;Automatique
Documentaire et Linguistique) under the guidance of
Maurice Gross. The format of a DELAS-type dictionary
basically consists of simple word lemmas accompanied
with inflectional class codes which allow for the
production of a DELAF-type dictionary, which consists of
all inflectional forms with their grammatical information.
In the Unitex environment, one finite-state transducer
responsible for the generation of all inflectional forms of
each DELAS lemma corresponds to each inflectional class
code. The Serbian morphological dictionary of simple
words contains 121,000 lemmas which yield the production
of approximately 1,450,000 different lexical words. Close
to 87,000 simple lemmas belong to the general lexica,
while the remaining 34,000 lemmas represent various kinds
of simple proper names [11]. The Bulgarian Grammar
dictionary (DELAS dictionary) consists of 127,000 lemmas
distributed as follows: app. 85,000 simple lemmas belong
to the general lexis, app. 6,000 lemmas represent domain
specific lexis and app. 36,000 lemmas are simple proper
names. The corresponding DELAF dictionary consists of
app. 1,260,000 entries [7].

2.3 Semantic Networks - Wordnet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982">
Semantic networks, seen as one important node in the
hierarchy of ontologies, are used more and more in various
phases of the automatic analysis of texts. The tool WS4LR
expects them to be in the form of wordnets, that is, nodes
representing sets of synonymous words (synsets) which are
linked by various semantic relations. The first built
wordnet was an English wordnet, the so-called Princeton
Wordnet (PWN), having today approximately 140,000
synsets. Due to its remarkable size and successful inclusion
in various computer-based applications, it is considered as
the de facto standard upon which wordnets for many other
languages have been built. One successful application of
this concept was achieved by the Balkanet project which
was funded by the European Commission from (2001-
2004). In the scope of this project, the development of
wordnets for the following Balkan languages was initiated
[20]: Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbian, and Turkish.
The important feature of these wordnets is that they are all
aligned with PWN via the Interlingual index (ILI) [22].
Namely, ILI consists of concepts, while wordnets represent

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872466666667">
the lexicalization of concepts in various languages and the
way which they are connected.
The Serbian wordnet today consists of more than
15,000 synsets built by app. 25,000 literals. All of them are
linked to PWN, except for 532 Balkan specific concepts
that are connected with other Balkan languages, and 155
Serbian specific concepts that remain unconnected with
other languages. The Bulgarian wordnet consists of more
then 31,000 synsets built by more than 66,000 literals. The
synsets are linked with the PWN as well; again there are
436 Balkan specific concepts shared with other Balkan
languages and 182 Bulgarian language specific concepts.
Both Serbian and Bulgarian wordnets, as well as wordnets
for other Balkan languages, are represented in WS4LR
using common XML schema.

2.4 The Prolex Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994777476190476">
The Prolex project was initiated in the 1990’s with the
study of toponyms in French and had the aim of
appropriately processing proper names in natural language
applications [16]. This work was followed by the
development of a Serbian version, which finally led to the
design and construction of a relational multilingual
dictionary of Proper Names, the Prolexbase, in the form of
a relational database [19]. This model is based on two main
concepts: the pivot (that represents the conceptual proper
name) at a language independent level and the prolexeme
(the projection of the pivot onto a particular language)
which is a set of lemmas that includes the name, but also its
aliases (variations in orthography, abbreviated forms,
acronyms, etc.) and its derivatives. For instance, if a
meronymy relation is established between the concepts
“New York” and “the United States of America”, then their
Serbian Latin equivalents Njujork and Sjedinjene Americke
Države, their Serbian Cyrillic equivalents ILyjopx and
Cjedurseue Amepuuxe )Tparcaee, and their Bulgarian
equivalents Hio Ilopx and Cbedunenu auepuxaucxu uFamu
are all connected automatically.

3. Using WS4LR with Aligned Texts
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878363636364">
The WS4LR module that works with aligned texts expects
them to be in the Translation Memory eXchange (TMX)
format1. It can transform texts previously aligned by
XAlign into this format as well as into several other
formats: textual, XML and tabular. This is particularly
important since XAlign has been integrated into Unitex
software starting from its version 2.1. In addition, the user
can also produce various visualizations of aligned texts by
applying appropriate XSLT transformations. Thus, the user
can freely browse with such visualized texts. One such
visualization is represented in Figure 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999358257142857">
User queries can be semantically expanded by the wordnets
and by the Prolex database. WS4LR obtains the semantic
expansion of a query by means of the wordnet of the first
language (the Serbian wordnet – SWN, as is the case in our
examples), selecting all synsets containing a given word
and offering them to the user. This provides the user with
an insight into all the concepts the keyword pertains to,
through sets of synonyms used for these concepts. A user
then gains the possibility to delete some of these synsets if
he or she decides that they pertain to concepts which are
not of interest at that particular moment. Also, the user can
formulate a bilingual query by adding a second language to
it. Namely, WS4LR can, for a given set of concepts,
identify all corresponding concepts in the second language
wordnet by using ILI. Thus, for an expanded Serbian
query, one could obtain the corresponding expanded query
in Bulgarian. The form used to bilingually expend a simple
query glava “head” with the Bulgarian znaea is presented
in Figure 2. The semantic expansion is obtained by
Browsing, however, is not a particularly successful
form of text exploration. The WS4LR module for aligned
texts offers the user the ability to posit different forms of
queries that can be automatically expanded by using
various bilingual lexical resources presented in the
previous section. WS4LR offers the user the possibility to
expand the query not only morphologically and
semantically, but also to another language. If the first
language is Serbian, the second language can be English,
Bulgarian, or any other. A user can choose two working
languages by adjusting the parameters in the “Preferences”
menu of WS4LR. Besides this, WS4LR provides further
possibilities for the user to control their query formulation,
since in addition to expansion it also offers the query to be
narrowed. Namely, a user can reject some of the
automatically offered query expansions.

checking the box “Semantic extension” in this form and by
choosing the appropriate resource (Wordnet in this case),
while the bilingual expansion is obtained by checking the
box “Another language extension”.
In the same form, the user can choose to
morphologically inflect all chosen keywords in both
languages. If he or she wishes to do so the box “With
inflection” should be checked. Morphological expansion is
performed by Unitex modules that use morphological
dictionaries of simple words as well as inflectional
transducers. This options works only if a particular query
keyword is listed in the morphological dictionary of the
corresponding language. If this is not so, the aligned text
will be searched only with the original keyword. As shown
in Figure 2, the automatically added inflected forms of
chosen keywords are presented in an editable form in
which some of these inflected forms can be deleted or
modified. For instance, the Serbian word put “path” has
two plural forms: putevi and puti. The second one is
restricted to poetical usage and a user can choose to delete
it from the expended query if the working text is not of that
kind.

Figure 2. The original query keyword glava is shown in the
upper left corner. The chosen query expansions are shown on

obtained list of inflected forms that can be edited. The two
fields at bottom show the final query set.

<bodyText confidence="0.999535294117647">
Finally, when a query is launched, the result is obtained
with all the retrieved occurrences highlighted (see Figure
3).
The query can be further semantically expanded by the
choice of a particular semantic relation (e.g.
hypernymy/hyponymy), in which case synsets pertaining to
hypernyms/hyponyms of concepts from the initial group
will also appear among the query set. This feature will be
illustrated by a query which starts with the Serbian
keyword brodic “small boat”. We would like to perform a
bilingual search with a semantic expansion. The chosen
Serbian keyword belongs to only one synset {brodica:1,
brodic:1} whose corresponding Bulgarian synset is
{n0gKa:1, nagm:1}. Figure 4 shows that these synsets are
deep in the hypernymy/hyponymy hierarchy. In such a
situation, expending query with hypernym synsets can be
useful.

from its corresponding synset brodica, but also with the
literals from synsets belonging to the hypernym branch of
the length two, that are {barka:1, 6amac:1, 6un:1} “boat”

Since in this case a bilingual search is initiated, the user can
perform the same semantic expansion for the second
language, presented in Figure 6. The two Bulgarian literals
thus obtained are nnaeamenen cbd and manbx xopa6 which
are multi-word units. Since inflection of multi-word units
for Bulgarian is not yet integrated in WS4LR, as will be
explained in the final section, the user can choose to delete
it from the final query set or to keep only the nouns cbd
and xopa6, as we have done in our example search.

The results obtained by this query are very interesting and,
show the potential this tool offers for various linguistic and
literary researches on their own. This query retrieved 129
aligned segments, each of which contained at least one of
the keywords from the produced query set in at least one of
the languages. It comes as a surprise that only 8 of these
segments contained query keywords in both languages.
This is mainly due to the fact that adjectives nnaeamenen
and manbx were omitted from the Bulgarian keywords thus
broadening the query on the Bulgarian side too much.
There were 5 segments with the keyword cbd, with two
occurrences of maeamenen cbd “vessel”; none of them
corresponded to the Serbian wordnet equivalent lada.
There were also 90 occurrences of xopa6 among which
there was not one .Manbx xopa6; in this case, however, the
Serbian equivalent for xopa6 was almost unmistakably
brod, as suggested by both wordnets.
Figure 7 shows some examples of a partial retrieval.
The first (n1616) and third (n2286) segments in this sample
occur due to the fact that the reference to a “boat” is
missing in one of the languages. The other segments show
that the Serbian brod, besides corresponding to the English
ship and the Bulgarian xopa6, is also a generic notion and
should probably be added to the hypernym synset
(segments n2274, n2356 and n2439). On the other hand,
Serbian jedrilica and jedrenjak “sailing vessel” are
translated in Bulgarian with the “sister” synsets xopa6 or
xopa6ue instead of using a more specific Bulgarian word
mamnoxod (segments n2299 and n2323). In the last
example (n3707), in Bulgarian a rather arbitrary choice
nodxa is made for a more specific type of a vessel referred
to in Serbian as kuter “cutter”.

Figure 8 shows eight examples of the full retrieval. In one
of these examples (n1972) for the Serbian camac the near
synonym in Bulgarian xopa6uemo is used (as determined
by wordnets). In two cases (n2267 and n2294) for the
Serbian brodic the near hypernym xopa6uemo is used,
while in five cases (n514, n518, n586, n3827, n4049) for
the Serbian camac and barka the near hyponym nodxa is
used. This is not an unexpected result; rather it only proves
that searching with the help of semantic networks, on the
web for instance, can be useful, which is the ultimate goal
of our experiments.

When a search is performed not with common keywords
but with proper nouns then a query expansion with Prolex
database offers more possibilities. Semantic relations
incorporated into this database are adapted to proper
names. Here, the user can choose to expand his query both
on the conceptual and the linguistic level. It can be seen in
Figure 9 how a query launched with a pivot Paris is

4. Additional Possibilities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999313">
We have illustrated the functions of WS4LR for working
with aligned texts in the previous section by using the
Serbian and Bulgarian pair. This can be successfully used
for other Balkan languages as well. Wordnets have been
being developed through the Balkanet project for Greek,
Romanian and Turkish, which have enabled the
experiments to have semantic query expansions for those
languages as well. For Greek [12] and Romanian [3],
morphological dictionaries in the LADL format have also
been developed – however, these resources were not at our
disposal so we have not been able to experiment with
morphological expansion for these languages.
The possibility and the need for some of the functions
developed within WS4LR to become available also on the
web have led to the development of the WS4QE web
application for lexical resources. This application is still
under development, but some of its functions can already
be used. Numerous user functions are envisaged for this
tool, but the largest set is related to the expansion of
queries submitted to the Google search engine, and they
have already been implemented. In fact, they are very
similar to those presented in the previous section. The only
difference is that expanded queries are not applied to an
aligned text but are rather forwarded to the search engine.
Figure 10 shows such a retrieval that starts with the
Serbian keyword barka “boat” and is further expended by
the Serbian synset {barka:1, camac:1, cun:1} and Greek
corresponding synset {p(xpxa:0, MµpOq:0}. Figure 11
represents the first results retrieved with such an expanded
query by Google.

5. Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883722222222">
Our main concern for our future work is the adequate
processing of multi-word units. That is, we would like our
tool to treat multi-word units in the same way as simple
words and to inflect them correctly upon request. The first
version of this approach was presented in [10]. Although
this version gave promising results for Serbian, it was
hardwired into the tool itself so that it was not easy to
modify the Serbian module or to apply it to other
languages. With a new approach that relies on the feature
structure description of a particular language’s morphology
[6] and widely uses XML technology, the portability to
other languages will be much easier [17]. On a more
practical level, our aim is enrich our lexical resources, first
of all to enrich the Prolex database, as we plan to use it in a
translation environment [14]. It is our wish to work in a
future with a true aligned Balkan text – that is, a text
originally written in a Balkan language and translated into
other Balkan languages.

In the preparatory phase each translation was marked in accordance with the TEI-standard in XML, and the title (&lt;head&gt;), paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) and segments (&lt;seg&gt;) were included as units of a text logical layout. At the beginning of the alignment process, all segments coincided with sentences automatically tagged by Unitex. The XAlign system [1] was used for the alignment process. Starting from the French version, the goal of the alignment was to establish 1:1 relations with all other languages on the segmental level. In order to achieve this goal and after manually checking all aligned segments, some of them had to be divided into smaller units, and some were grouped into larger units. Thus, we arrived at the total of 4,409 segments in all texts. This way, the missing segments or the inconsistencies between the source text and its translations were identified in most of the cases.

The format of a DELAS-type dictionary basically consists of simple word lemmas accompanied with inflectional class codes which allow for the production of a DELAF-type dictionary, which consists of all inflectional forms with their grammatical information.

In the following sections we will briefly present these resources, what methodological framework was used for their development, and how they were integrated for their successful usage. 2.1 Textual Resources – Aligned Texts The aligned texts as a special form of multilingual corpora were the focus of many projects in the past few decades. A systematic approach to the development of multilingual corpora was initiated within the Multext project, which subsequently included East-European languages through the Multext-East project [5]. In the meantime, many multilingual corpora have been compiled from large corpora, usually fully automatically prepared, which have a range comprised from texts in the limited technical domain [18] to more versatile literary corpora [5] that are often more modest in size but minutely prepared. The main textual resource used to explore WS4LR is Jules Verne’s novel Around the World in Eighty Days. This text was chosen for various reasons. First of all, the text is available in digital form for the majority of European languages, including Balkan languages. Regarding its content, it represents a</context>

Figure 11 represents the first results retrieved with such an expanded query by Google. 5. Further Work Our main concern for our future work is the adequate processing of multi-word units. That is, we would like our tool to treat multi-word units in the same way as simple words and to inflect them correctly upon request. The first version of this approach was presented in [10]. Although this version gave promising results for Serbian, it was hardwired into the tool itself so that it was not easy to modify the Serbian module or to apply it to other languages.

A systematic approach to the development of multilingual corpora was initiated within the Multext project, which subsequently included East-European languages through the Multext-East project [5]. In the meantime, many multilingual corpora have been compiled from large corpora, usually fully automatically prepared, which have a range comprised from texts in the limited technical domain [18] to more versatile literary corpora [5] that are often more modest in size but minutely prepared. The main textual resource used to explore WS4LR is Jules Verne’s novel Around the World in Eighty Days. This text was chosen for various reasons.

The first built wordnet was an English wordnet, the so-called Princeton Wordnet (PWN), having today approximately 140,000 synsets. Due to its remarkable size and successful inclusion in various computer-based applications, it is considered as the de facto standard upon which wordnets for many other languages have been built. One successful application of this concept was achieved by the Balkanet project which was funded by the European Commission from (2001- 2004). In the scope of this project, the development of wordnets for the following Balkan languages was initiated [20]: Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbian, and Turkish.
