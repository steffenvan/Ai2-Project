ABSTRACT
In a well-structured Lexical Data Base, a
number of relations among lexical entries can be
interactively evidenced. The present article
examines hyponymy, as an example of paradigmatic
relation, and &amp;quot;restriction&amp;quot; relation, as a
syntagmatic relation. The theoretical results of
their implementation are illustrated.
For both relations, the paper presents the
different procedures by which they are
automatically recognized and extracted from the
natural language definitions, the degree of
reliability of their automatic labeling, the use
of these labels in interactive queries on the
lexical data base, and finally the theoretical
results of their implementation in a
Machine-Dictionary.

II THE LANGUAGE OF DEFINITIONS AS A SUBLANGUAGE
I INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996792061538462">
In previous papers it has been pointed out
that in a well-structured Lexical Data Base it
becomes possible to detect automaticaliy. and to
evidence through interactive queries a number of
morphological, syntactic, or semantic
relationships between lexical entries, such as
synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy. derivation.
case-argument, lexical field, etc.
The present article examines hyponymy, as an
example of paradigmatic relation, and what can be
called &amp;quot;restriction or modification&amp;quot; relation, as
a syntagmatic relation. by restriction or
modification relation, i mean that part of a
so-called &amp;quot;aristotelian&amp;quot; definition which has the
function of linking the &amp;quot;genus&amp;quot; and the
&amp;quot;differentia specifica&amp;quot;.
When evidenced in a lexicon, the hyponymy
relation produces hierarchical trees partitioning
the lexicon in many semantically coherent
subsets. These trees are not created once and
for all, but it is important that they are
procedurally activated at the query moment..
While evidencing the second relation
considered, one can investigate as to whether it
is possible to discover any correlation between
lexical or grammatical features in definitions
and particular kinds of &amp;quot;definienda&amp;quot;, and thus
try to answer questions such as the following:
&amp;quot;Are there any connections between these
restriction relations and the fundamental ways of
definition, i.e. the criterial parameters by
which people defines things?&amp;quot;
I am trying to develop and exploit the idea of
considering the language of dictionary
definitions as a particular sublanguage within
natural language. This perspective cannot
obviously be adopted for subject matter
restrictions in definitions, but only for the
purpose of the text, i.e. the specific
communicative goal. From this restriction on the
purpose of the text, certain lexico-grammatical
restrictions do result, which prove to be very
useful.
As to the restrictions on the lexical richness
of definitions, these are not due to the fact
that they relate to a specific domain of
discourse, but only to the property of closure
(although not satisfied at 100%) that the
defining vocabulary should in principle be
simpler and more restricted than the defined set
of lemmas, i.e. the former should be a proper
subset of the latter.
This kind of quantitative restriction on the
vocabulary of definitions would not be of any
interest in itself, if it were not accompanied by
other kinds of constraints both on a) the
lexical, and on b) the grammatical side.
a) From the frequency list of the words used
in definitions (about 800,000 word-occurrences,
and 75,000 word-types), it appears in fact that
some words have a much greater importance than in
normal language, as evidenced by a comparison
with the data of the Lessico di Frequenza della
Lingua Italiana Conterporanea (Bortolini et al.,
1971). These are the defining generic terms

<bodyText confidence="0.9996971">
which are traditionally used by lexicographers,
such as ACT, EFFECT, PERSON, OBJECT, WHO,
PROCESS, CAUSE, etc. It is not by chance that
these same concepts are of relevance in many
Artificial Intelligence systems.
b) Not only single words, or classes of words,
are particularly relevant in the defining
sublanguage. There are also lexical patterns and
syntactic patterns which occur with great
frequency, and which play a very special role in
defining sentences.
The combination of these constraints can be
and actually is very useful, when trying to
exploit the information contained in definitions,
and when transforming an archive of natural
language definitions into a knowledge base.
structured as a network. Some important parts of
knowledge are in fact already retrievable in
interactive mode from the Italian Lexical Data
Base, which has recently been restructured.
Analyses on large corpora of definitions,
carried out on many dictionaries (Amsler, 1980;
Calzolari, 1983a, 1983b; Michiels, Noel. 1982)
have in fact shown that the definitions
sublanguage displays several regularities of
lexical and syntactic occurrences and patterns.
These general lexical classes and the classes of
recurrent patterns can be more or less easily
captured for instance by pattern-matching rules,
and if possible characterized with formal rules.

II] HYPONYMY RELATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943">
Hyponymy is the most important relation to be
evidenced in a lexicon. Due to its taxonomic
nature, it gives the lexicon, when implemented, a
particular hierarchical structure: its result is
obviously not a tree, but many tangled
hierarchies (Amsler, 1980).
Instead of evidencing and labelling this
relation by hand, I have tried to characterize it
procedurally. The procedure which automatically
coded (with a precision of more than 90%
calculated on a random sample of 2000
definitions) true superordinates in all the
definitions (approx. 185.000 for 103,000 lemmas).
was based almost exclusively on the position of
the &amp;quot;genus&amp;quot; term at the beginning of the
definitional phrases, giving Nouns, Verbs, and
Adjectives as superordinates of defined entries
of the same lexical category. Ad hoc subroutines
solved exceptional cases where a) quantifiers, or
other modifiers preceded the genus term (e.g.
aletta ---&gt; piccolo gruppo di penne dietro
l&apos;angolo dell&apos;ala), or b) more than one genus was
present in the definition (e.g. assordare
attutire, smorzarsi detto di suono), or c) a
prepositional phrase, usually of locative type,
was at the beginning of the phrase (e.g. piazzato
---&gt; nel rugby, ca/do al pallone collocato sul
terreno).
Even though the first immediate purpose of
this procedure is of classificational nature, the
ultimate goal is the extraction and formalization
of the most relevant relationship between lexical
items which is implicitly stored in any standard
printed dictionary. It is in fact now possible
to retrieve in the lexical data base not only all
the definitions in which any possible word-form
appears, together with the defined lemmas (e.g.
SUONO appears in 328 definitions), but also to
retrieve on-line, if desired, only the
definitions in which the given word-form is used
as a superordinate, therefore with the list of
its hyponyms (e.g. the same word SUONO is used as
superordinate of only 65 words, i.e. of a subset
of the preceding set containing MUSICA, RUMORE,
SQUILL°, SUSSURRO, etc.).
The query-language so far implemented for the
lexical data base permits therefore to retrieve
information on this hierarchical relation.
identifying on-line the allowable
interconnections within the entire lexicon. The
links produced can be analyzed, evaluated, and,
if necessary, interactively corrected.
From explorations on the trees thus obtained,
we can also try to set up classes and subclasses
of superordinates, on the basis of the upper
nodes to which many other nodes are connected as
descendants. Only as an example, the
identification criterion for the noun-class
&amp;quot;SET-OF&amp;quot; containing 1NSIEME, GRUPPO, COLLEZIONE,
COMPLESSO, AGGREGATO. etc., among the set of
noun-superordinates, is the fact that they are
linked one to the other in the tree which results
from querying the data base. Their hyponyms will
obviously be for the most part collective nouns.
The identification of word-classes like this
one leads to the next step in the formalization
of the hyponymy relation, which will consist in
the insertion of a label indicating a semantic
class to these sets of superordinates. It will
thus be possible to retrieve, for example, all
the nouns generically definable as &amp;quot;SET-OF&amp;quot;,
independently of the particular word denoting a
set used in definitions. Since it is already
possible to trace these chains of hyponyms going
upwards or downwards for more than one level, one
can immediately ask whether, for example,
MASSERIA belongs to the set of collectives even
if it is defined as MANDRIA. because MANDRIA is
defined as BRANCO, which is in turn defined as
INSIEME, which finally is one of the nouns
belonging to the class &amp;quot;SET-OF&amp;quot;.

IV RESTRICTION RELATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999670065573771">
Even though some refinements are still
required in order to improve the reliability of
the automatic recovery of ISA-related terms
chains, this kind of structural relation within
the lexicon, that is hyponymy, is at a good stage
of implementation in the Italian lexical data
base.
Much still remains to be done as far as other
very interesting relationships between the
entries are concerned. I am now considering what
could be called &amp;quot;restriction or modification&amp;quot;
relation, since its purpose is to restrict or
modify the meaning of the genus term. It is
exemplified in the following definitions by the
words in italics:
stannite calcopirite contenente stagno
arricciolare ---&gt; modellare a forma di ricciolo
risonatore dispositivo otto a generare
risonanza
I wish to evaluate what could be done with
respect to this kind of relation, starting from
the available definitional data. One of the
first aims of this lexicological research is to
analyze, by means of computational tools. and LO
use the information contained in the different
definitional formats and structures. The
implementation of a number of procedures which
convert the natural language information conveyed
by definitions into processable formats, made up
by structured relational links between lexical
items or classes of lexical items, is now taken
into consideration.
These formats can be made traceable e.g. in an
Information Retrieval system on definitions, like
the one actually implemented, on the entire
corpus, for the taxonomic part of the lexical
structure. But these formatted relational
structures can also be used as starting points
for a computationally exploitable reorganization
of the definitional content. One of the
characteristics of the definitional sublanguage,
i.e. the presence of recurrent patterns such as
proprio di, relativo a, prodotto do, originario
di, etc.), enables, at least in certain cases, to
produce a constant mapping from certain variable
types of more frequently detected definitional
phrases to constant underlying relational
structures.
Using rather simple pattern-matching
procedures some classes and subclasses of
definitions can be separated, and a small number
of simpler types of definitions have already been
converted into a formalized coded format also
with regard to this restriction relation. A new
virtual Relation is thus added to the original
data base. The distinguished elements of a
number of simple natural language patterns are
mapped into some general structured information
formats. Up to now, some of the definitions
displaying the following restriction relations
have been treated:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.859696666666667">
REL.FORM (e.g. a forma di)
REL.PROV (e.g. provvisto 07)
REL.APT (e.g. atto a)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982639307692308">
and the corresponding relational links generated.
Among the lexical variants of REL.PROV there
are fornito di, dotato di, nrynito di, plena di,
ricco di, etc.; while REL.FORM groups the
following variants of a different type: in forma
di, che ha (la) forma (di), di forma, di forma
simile a (quella di), sotto forma di, ovente forma
di, etc. It is thus possible. for example, to
retrieve, among the 1271 definitions in which the
word FORMA appears, only those defining something
as &amp;quot;having the shape of something else&amp;quot;. The
implementation of these links allows to produce
another kind of partitioning within the lexical
system, and permits to better investigate the
internal structure of words.
A procedure of the kind exemplified above,
based on pattern-matching, is possible for a good
number of definition types: for example, with a
different format, for many adjectives:
def NP 7
Adj RELY
&apos; VP
where several groups of definitions are found to
share a common underlying structure in terms of
the restriction relation involved, in spite of
other lexical and syntactic_ differences.

V FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958571428571">
A comparison with the definitional corpora of
other dictionaries, also of other languages, will
certainly prove to be useful in establishing the
Set of the most general or primitive Relations,
used for definition in lexicographical practice,
often overlapping with the primitive Relations
stated in many Al systems. These relations,
mapped into a formal link in the data base, can
then be paraphrased in each language, in the
standard language.
The data base structure envisaged does permit
both to maintain at a lower level (the starting
level), and to eliminate at an upper level, many
peculiarities and variations in the linguistic

expression of the same or of similar concepts or
relations; their effect is to facilitate the
comprehension by the users of the printed
dictionary, inhibiting however immediate
comprehension by procedural routines in the
mechanical processing of dictionary data.
By applying similar methods of automatic
conversion and mapping into suitable formats, as
extensively as possible throughout the lexicon,
many definitional expressions can be submitted to
an attempt of standardization, thus achieving
major precision, which gives a considerable
improvement when performing, for example,
information retrieval operations on the content
of a dictionary.
This more structured, but, in another sense.
simplified version of definitions, which also
accounts for their relational nature, provides an
excellent basis for testing and studying the
&amp;quot;knowledge of the world&amp;quot; which underlies the
structure of a dictionary.
