This paperl decribes a computational treatment of
the semantics of relational nouns. It covers relational
nouns such as &amp;quot;sister and &amp;quot;commander&amp;quot;, and focuses
especially on a particular subcategory of them, called
function nouns (&amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;). Rela-
tional nouns are usually viewed as either requiring
non-compositional semantic interpretation, or causing
an undesirable proliferation of syntactic rules. In con-
trast to this, we present a treatment which is both
syntactically uniform and semantically compositional.
The core ideas of this treatment are: (1) The recog-
nition of different levels of semantic analysis; in par-
ticular, the distinction between an English-oriented
and a domain-oriented level of meaning represen-
tation. (2) The analysis of relational nouns as denoting
relation-extensions.
The paper shows how this approach handles a
variety of linguistic constructions involving relational
nouns. The treatment presented here has been im-
plemented in BBN&apos;s Spoken Language System, an
experimental spoken language interface to a
database/graphics system.

When Jean Piaget faced his nine year old subject
Hal with the question &amp;quot;What&apos;s a brother?&amp;quot;, the answer
was: &amp;quot;When there&apos;s a boy and another boy, when
there are two of them.&amp;quot; And, with a greater degree of
formal precision, ten year old Bern replied to the same
question: &amp;quot;A brother is a relation, one brother to
another. &amp;quot;[2] [8] What these children are beginning to
be able to articulate is that there is something wrong
with the experimenter&apos;s question as it is posed: it talks
about &amp;quot;brothers&amp;quot; as if they constituted a natural kind,
as if there is a way of looking at an individual to find
out whether he is a brother. But &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; is normally
not used that way â€” a property which it shares with
words like &amp;quot;co-author&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;commander&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;.

we shall see in a moment, their semantic properties
differ significantly from those of other nouns, so that
the standard treatments of nominal semantics don&apos;t
apply to them. The problem of the semantic inter-
pretation of relational nouns constitutes the topic of
this paper. We shall argue that this problem is indeed
a semantic one, and should preferably not be treated
in the syntax. The semantic treatment that we present
uses a multilevel semantics framework, and is based
on the idea of assigning relation extensions as
denotations to relational nouns.
Relational nouns are semantically unsaturated.
They are normally used in combination with an implicit
or explicit argument: &amp;quot;John&apos;s brother&amp;quot;. The argument
of a relational noun, if overtly realized in the sentence,
is connected to the noun by means of a relation-
denoting lexical element: the verb &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; or one of its
semantic equivalents (the genitive and the preposi-
tions &amp;quot;or and &amp;quot;with): &amp;quot;John has a sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;John&apos;s
sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a sister of John&apos;s&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a boy with a sister&amp;quot;. It has
been noted that these lexical items interact differently
with relational nouns than they do with other nouns.
[7] Compare, for instance, the noun &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; in
(1)/(1abcd) with the relational noun &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; in the
parallel sentences (2)/(2abcd): (1) entails (1abcd),
but the corresponding (2) does not entail (2abcd).2

A particular subcategory of the relational nouns,
that we shall consider in some detail, is constituted by
the function nouns; they are semantically distinct in
that for every argument they refer to exactly one en-
tity, which is an element of a linear ordering: a num-
2We refrain from saying that (2abcd) are ungrammatical. Because
of the semantic open-endedness of &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; and the genitive, these
sentences can certainly be wellformed and meaningful, if uttered in
an appropriate context. The issue at stake is that the interpretation
which is the salient one for the genitive in (2) is not available for the
corresponding elements in (2abcd). Sentences displaying this
property have been marked with the 4-sign (rather than the
ungrammaticality-asterisk) in this paper.

ber, an amount, or a grade. Examples are &amp;quot;length&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;. Function nouns can be
used in constructions which exclude other nouns,
relational as well as non-relational. Compare, for in-
stance:

The examples above show that there are sig-
nificant semantic differences between phrases con-
necting relational nouns to their functions/values, and
the corresponding, similarly structured phrases built
around other nouns. This suggests that the standard
treatment of ordinary nouns cannot be applied directly
to relational nouns and yield correct results. To con-
clude this introductory section, we investigate this is-
sue in a little more detail.
Assume a semantic framework with the following,
not very unusual, features. Nouns are analyzed as
set-denoting constants; concomitantly, adjectives are
analyzed as one-place predicates, prepositions as
two-place predicates, verbs as n-place predicates.
Plural noun phrases with &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; or a possessive denote
sets which have the same semantic type as the noun
around which they are built &amp;quot;John&apos;s cars&amp;quot; denotes a
particular set of cars. In this approach, the represen-
tation of the noun phrase &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sisters&amp;quot;would be:
(x e SISTERS f POSSESS(PETER,x)),
where SISTERS denotes the set of persons who are a
sister, and POSSESS represents the possessive rela-
tion indicated by the genitive construction.
Now this expression does not have the right
properties. It lacks necessary information: the predi-
cate (X x: POSSESS(PETER,x)) applies to elements
of the extension of SISTERS; it cannot take into ac-
count how this extension was defined. For instance, if
in a particular world the set of sisters is co-extensional
with the set of co-authors, the approach just outlined
would incorrectly assign to &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sisters&amp;quot; the same
denotation as to &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s co-authors&amp;quot;.
It is clear what the source of the problem is: the
semantic representations for relational nouns con-
sidered above denote simple sets of individuals, and
do not contain any information about the relation in-
volved. To salvage a uniform compositional treatment,
a richer representation is needed. One might think of
invoking Montague&apos;s individual concepts [3] [6], or en-
riching one&apos;s ontology with qua-individuals
(distinguishing between Mary qua sister and Mary qua
aunt) [4]. In section 4 we will present our solution to
this problem. First, we discuss why we didn&apos;t choose
for a more syntactically oriented approach.

2 AGAINST SYNTACTIC TREATMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938239130435">
Often, the complexities mentioned above are
taken to require a distinction between intransitive
common nouns and transitive common nouns in the
syntax, with a concommittant proliferation of syntactic
rules. Instead, we have chosen to extend a treatment
of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns only at the semantic processing
stage. We shall now indicate some of the reasons for
this choice.
Relational nouns are semantically dependent on
an argument. In this respect, they are more reminis-
cent of verbs than of standard nouns like &amp;quot;boy&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;chair&amp;quot;. Most verbs of English have one or more ar-
gument places that must be filled for the verb to be
used in a syntactically/semantically felicitous way; this
property of verbs is probably an important reason for
the persisting tendency to analyze them as n-place
predicates rather than sets of situations. The semantic
similarity between relational nouns and verbs has
given rise to treatments which model the syntactic
treatment of nouns on the treatment of verbs: one
introduces lexical subcategories for nouns which in-
dicate how many arguments they take and how these
arguments are marked; the syntactic rules combine
N-bars or noun-phrases with genitive phrases and
preposition-phrases, taking these subcategorizations
into account. [15] We will now argue, however, that
from a syntactic point of view such a move is unattrac-
tive.
Syntactically, relational nouns do not behave very
differently from &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns. They combine with
adjectives, determiners, preposition phrases and rela-
tive clauses to form noun phrases with a standard
X-bar structure; and the noun phrases thus con-
stituted can participate in all sentence-level structures
that other noun phrases partake in.
Also, no nouns have syntactic properties that
would be analogous to the sentence-level
phenomenon of a verb obligatorily taking one or more
arguments. The overt realization of the arguments of
a &amp;quot;transitive noun&amp;quot; is always optional.
Finally, we may note that relational nouns can be
connected to their arguments/values by a variety of
verbs and prepositions, which constitute a semantic
complex that is also used, with exactly the same
structure but with a different meaning, to operate on
non-relational nouns. Compare, for instance:

ownership relation, for the part-whole relation, and for
the relation between a function and its argument
These terms (like &amp;quot;or, &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;with&amp;quot;) are highly
polysemous, and any language processing system
must encompass mechanisms for disambiguating
their intended meaning in any particular utterance.
To summarize: relational nouns do not distinguish
themselves syntactically from other nouns, and they
mark their function-argument structures by means of
polysemous descriptive terms. We therefore conclude
that it would be theoretically elegant as well as com-
putationally effective to treat relational and non-
relational nouns identically at the syntactic level, and
to account for the semantics of relational noun con-
structions by exploiting independently motivated dis-
ambiguation mechanisms. The remainder of this
paper describes such a treatment.
First, Section 3 discusses the multilevel semantics
architecture which constitutes the framework for our
approach. Section 4 presents our answer to a basic
question about relational nouns: what should their
denotations be? This section then goes on to
describe the semantic transformations which derive
the desired analyses of constructions involving rela-
tional nouns. Section 5 briefly discusses the interface
with a Discourse Model, which is necessary to recover
arguments of a relation that are left implicit in an ut-
terance. Section 6 shows that our treatment is useful
for the purpose of response-formulation in question-
answering.

3 MULTILEVEL SEMANTICS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999315904761905">
Our approach to the problem of relational nouns is
based on the idea of multilevel semantics: the distinc-
tion between different levels of semantic analysis.
[1] [10] In this approach, interpreting a natural lan-
guage sentence is a multi-stage process, which starts
out with a high-level meaning representation which
reflects the semantic structure of the English sentence
rather directly, and then applies translation rules
which specify how the English-oriented semantic
primitives relate to the ones that are used at deeper
levels of analysis.
At every level of analysis, the meaning of an input
utterance is represented as an expression of a logical
language.3 The languages used at the various levels
of analysis differ in that at every level the descriptive
constants are chosen so as to correspond to the
semantic primitives which are assumed at that level.
At the highest semantic level, the meaning of an
input utterance is represented as an expression of the
English-oriented Formal Language (EFL). The con-
stants of EFL correspond to the descriptive terms of

English. A feature of ER which is both unusual and
important, is the fact that descriptive constants are
allowed to be ambiguous. Within each syntactic cate-
gory, every word is represented in ER by a single
descriptive constant, no matter how many senses the
word may have. An ER expression can thus be seen
as an expression schema, where every constant can
be expanded out in a possibly large number of dif-
ferent ways. (See [5] for details on the model theory
of such a logic.)
The ambiguity of ER_ follows from its domain-
independence. All descriptive words of a language are
polysemous, and only when used in the context of a
particular subject domain do they acquire a single
precise meaning â€” a meaning which cannot be articu-
lated independently of that subject domain. Even
within one subject domain, many words have a range
of different meanings. Joint representations for such
sets of possible expansions are computationally ad-
vantageous; and when the range of possibilities is
defined in an open-ended way. they are even neces-
sary. Such cases occur when we attempt to account
for the interpretation of metonymy, metaphor and
nominal compounds [12], or the interpretation of mul-
tilevel plural noun phrases [11].
The logical language used at the domain-
dependent level of representation is called the World
Model Language (WML). This is an unambiguous lan-
guage, with an ordinary model-theoretic interpretation.
Its constants are chosen to correspond to the con-
cepts which constitute the domain of discourse.4
We can illustrate the distinction between ER and
WML by means of an example involving relational
nouns. Compare (4) and (5) below. Sentence (4) will
usually be translated into something like (4a):3
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.882318333333333">
(4) &amp;quot;John has a house in Hawaii.&amp;quot;
(4a) 3 h e (he HOUSES! IN(h,HAWAII)):
HAVE(JOHN,h)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999514">
Now consider (5) instead; a single-level architecture
would have to analyse this sentence as (5b) rather
than (5a), since (5b) is the representation one would
prefer to end up with.

<listItem confidence="0.872592">

(5a) 3 c (cc SPEEDS

I OF(c, amounte15, KNOTS))):
HAVE(FREDERICK,c)
4To provide a smooth interface with underlying application sys-
tems, there is a third level of semantic interpretation. The language
used at this level is called the Data Base Language (DBL). Its
constants stand for the files and attributes of the database to be
accessed, and the available graphics system operations and their
parameters.
5Accommodating discourse anaphora may motivate a different
treatment of the indefinite noun phrase. representing its semantics by
a Skolefr-constant or a similar device, rather than by the traditional
existential quantifier. For the present discussion we may ignore this
issue.

In a multilevel semantics architecture, however,
one would prefer to maintain a completely uniform first
stage in the semantic interpretation process, where
(5) would be treated exactly as (4), and therefore be
analyzed as (5a). By applying appropriate EFL-to-
WML translation rules, the EFL expression (5a) would
then be transformed into the WML expression (5b).
Taking natural language at semantic face value thus
simplifies the process of creating an initial meaning
representation. The remaining question then is,
whether one can in fact write EFL-to-WML translation
rules which yield the desired results. This is the ques-
tion we will come back to in section 4. In the
remainder of the present section, we first give some
more detail on the general properties of the translation
rules and the logical languages.
The interpretive rules which map syntactic struc-
tures onto EFL expressions are compositional, i.e.,
they correspond in a direct way to the syntactic rules
which define the legal input strings. There is a
methodological reason for this emphasis on corn-
positionality: it makes it possible to guarantee that all
possible combinations between syntactic rules are in
fact covered by the interpretive rules, and to minimize
surprises about the way the rules interact. Similar
considerations apply when we think about the defini-
tion of the EFL-to-WML translation: we wish to
guarantee that the WML translations of every EFL
expression are defined in an effectively computable
way, and that the different rules which together
specify the translation interact in a predictable fash-
ion. This is achieved by specifying the EFL-to-WML
translation using strictly local rules: rules operating
only on constants, which specify for every ER. con-
stant the WML expressions that it translates into.
Translation by means of local rules, which expand
constants into complex expressions, tends to create
fairly large and complicated formulas. The result of
the EFL-to-WML translation is therefore processed by
a logical simplification module; this keeps formulas
from becoming too unwieldy to handle and impossible
to evaluate.
Local rules by themselves do not specify what
combinations between them will lead to legitimate
results. Since the rules can be applied independently
of each other, we need a separate mechanism for
checking the meaningfulness of their combined opera-
tion. This mechanism is the semantic type system.
EFL, WML and DBL are typed languages. This
means that for every expression of these languages,
a semantic type is defined. The denotation of an ex-
pression is guaranteed to be a member of the set
denoted by its type. In WML, for instance,
FREDERICK has the type SHIPS which denotes the
set of all ships; GUAM and INDIAN-OCEAN have the
type LOCATIONS which denotes the set of all loca-
tions; CARRIERS and SHIPS both have the type
SETS (SHIPS) which denotes the powerset of the set
of all ships; F-SPEED has the type
FUNCTIONS(U(SHIPS,PLANES, LAND-VEHICLES),
AMOUNTS(SPEED-UNITS)),
which denotes the set of functions whose domain is
the union of the sets of ships, of planes and of land
vehicles, and whose range is the set of amount-
expressions whose units are members of the set of
speed-units.
Given the types of the constants occurring in it,
the type of a complex expression is determined by
formal rules. For instance, the expression
F-SPEED(FREDERICK) would have the type
AMOUNTS(SPEED-UNITS). The rules which define
the types of complex expressions also define when an
expression does not have a legitimate type, and is
therefore not considered to be a bona fide member of
the language. For instance, F-SPEED(GUAM) does
not have a legitimate type, because the type-
computation rule for function-application expressions
requires that the type of the argument not be disjoint
with the domain of the function.
The semantic type constraints make it possible to
express the possible interpretations of ambiguous
ER. constants by means of local translation rules,
without running the danger of creating spurious non-
sensical combinations. For instance, if &amp;quot;Guam&amp;quot; were
the name of a ship as well as the name of a location,
there could be one ER. constant GUAM-EFL with
two WML-expansions: GUAM-LOC with type
LOCATIONS and GUAM-SHIP with type SHIPS. Ap-
plying the EFL-to-WML rules to
F-SPEED(GUAM-EFL) would nevertheless yield only
one result, since the other combination would be
deemed illegitimate.
In the next section we show how relational noun
denotations and EFL-to-WML translations may be
chosen in such a way that sentences involving rela-
tional nouns after an initially uniform treatment end up
with plausible truth conditions â€” so that, for instance,
(5) above can be initially analyzed as (5a) and then
translated into (5b) in a principled way.

4 MULTILEVEL SEMANTICS FOR

The treatment we propose is based on a simple,
yet powerful idea: analyse a relational noun as denot-
ing the extension of the corresponding relation R (i.e.,
the set of pairs &lt;x,y&gt; such that R(x,y)), and allow
predicates to apply not only to individuals but also to
such pairs.6
As an example, consider again the phrase
Peter&apos;s sisters.&amp;quot; that we discussed in section 1
above. In the treatment we propose, this phrase
would get the ER. analysis (6a).
&apos;Terminology: We assume directed relations. If &lt;x,y&gt; is a pair in a
relation-extension, we call x the argument and y the value.

<bodyText confidence="0.99935721875">
Thus, we see that by allowing the semantic trans-
lation of &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s&amp;quot; to select over pairs consisting of a
person and the sister of that person, we can end up
with a representation of &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sisters&amp;quot; which comes
close to having the right denotation: it denotes the
correct set of persons, but they are still paired up with
Peter. This &amp;quot;extra information&amp;quot; is of course a problem.
For instance, &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sisters are Mary&apos;s aunts.&amp;quot; as-
serts the equality of two sets of persons, not two sets
of pairs of persons.
It turns out that we have two distinct cases to deal
with: to account for the interaction between a rela-
tional noun and the phrases which indicate its ar-
guments and values, we would like to treat it as
denoting a relation-extension; but to account for its
interaction with everything else, we would like to treat
it as denoting a set of individuals. In order to make the
relational treatment yield the right results, we must
assume that part of the meaning of ordinary descrip-
tive predicates is an implicit projection-operator, which
projects tuples onto their value-elements. This is the
solution we adopt. We formalize it by means of a
meaning-postulate schema which applies to every
function F which is not among a small number of ex-
plicitly noted exceptions: V x,y: F(x) Ffry,x&gt;)
The copula &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; is not an exception to this mean-
ing postulate schema: it operates on values rather
than relation-elements. This is the reason why &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;
is not available as an argument for &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; in (2ac)
above (&amp;quot;Some punks of John&apos;s are brothers.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some
brothers are John&apos;s&amp;quot;)

translation rules which handle the relational nouns in
a little more detail. The EFL relations have many
different translations into WML; which ones are
relevant in a given case, is decided by considering the
semantic types of the arguments to which they are
applied. Consider again, for example, the part of the
EFL-to-WML translation rules that deals with the inter-
pretation of the possessive relation as specifying a
relational argument, as in &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Frederick&apos;s
speed&amp;quot;:
POSSESS =&gt; (A. u,v: u v[11)
where u has type THINGS and v has type THINGS X
THINGS. Being a local translation rule, this rule could
be applied to any occurrence of POSSESS in an EFL
formula. However, many such applications would give
rise to semantically anomalous WML formulas (with
necessarily denotationless sub-expressions) which
are filtered out if there are any other non-anomalous
interpretations. For instance, the above rule for
POSSESS would yield an anomalous expression if
applied to the representation of &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s cars&amp;quot;, be-
cause the ER_ constant CARS does not denote a set
of pairs but a set of individual entities. It would also
yield an anomalous expression if applied to &amp;quot;The USS
Frederick&apos;s sisters*, because the type of the EFL con-
stant FREDERICK, which is SHIPS, is disjoint with the
argument type of R-SISTER, which is
U(MALES,FEMALES).
To avoid spurious generation of anomalous ex-
pressions, the semantic types of the arguments of an
ER. function or EFL relation are checked before the
EFL-to-WML rule for that function or relation is ap-
plied. For instance, the above rule for POSSESS will
only be applied to an expression of the form
POSSESS(A,B), if A and B have types a and p such
that

As noted above, the interdefinability which exists
between &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;, the genitive, and &amp;quot;with&amp;quot;, when
they are used, for instance, in reference to ownership,
carries over to their use for indicating the relation be-
tween a relational noun and its argument. Thus, the
EFL representations of &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; have
WML translations which, modulo the order of their ar-
guments, are all identical to the rule for POSSESS
discussed above.
Function nouns, like &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;length&amp;quot;, induce
a special interpretation on preposition phrases with
&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;. Such phrases can be used to connect the func-
tion noun with its value. The treatment of relational
nouns sketched in the previous section can also ac-
commodate this phenomenon, as we shall show now.
Consider example (7) below, which is identical to
(5) above. It gets, in the treatment we propose, the
ER. analysis (5a); this analysis is exactly analogous
to the one that a syntactically similar sentence involv-
ing a non-relational noun would get. (Cf. (4) and (4a).)

To achieve the desired result, we need a rule for

not analogous to the rule for POSSESS above: &amp;quot;a
speed of 15 knots&amp;quot; is unlike &amp;quot;the speed of the USS
Frederick&amp;quot; in that in the former case we must connect
the relation with its value rather than its argument.

Note that different rules for one EFL constant can
coexist without conflict, because of the assumption of
lexical ambiguity in EFL. (In the general case, an EFL
expression will have several WML expansions for this
reason; often, many rule-applications will be blocked
by semantic type-checking.)
This basic approach makes it possible to trans-
form the EFL representation of any of the construc-
tions shown in the examples in section 1 into reason-
able World Model Language and Data Base Lan-
guage formulations of the intended query. We shall
illustrate the process of applying the EFL-to-WML
translations and logical simplifications in a little more
detail while showing how to extend this treatment to
function nouns which can take more than one ar-
gument. Such nouns interact with specific kinds of
preposition phrases to pick up their arguments. For
instance: &amp;quot;Frederick&apos;s distance to Hawaii&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the dis-
tance from Hawaii to Guam&amp;quot;. As an example, we will
now discuss the noun &amp;quot;readiness&amp;quot; as used in the U.S.
Navy, which designates a two-argument function.
&amp;quot;Readiness&amp;quot;, as used in the Navy battle manage-
ment domain, refers to the degree to which a vessel -
to be more precise, a unit- is prepared for combat or
for a specific mission. This degree is indicated on a
five-point scale, using either c-codes (Cl to C5), if
referring to combat readiness, or m-codes (M1 to M5),
if referring to mission readiness. The readiness for
combat can furthermore be the overall readiness (the
default case) or the readiness with respect to one of
the four resource readiness areas: personnel, train-
ing, equipment or supplies. Therefore,
READINESS-OF is a function which maps two ar-
guments, an element of SHIPS and an element of

Consider as an example the noun phrase &amp;quot;the
readiness of Frederick&amp;quot;. If we ignore for the moment
the effect of the &amp;quot;singular the&amp;quot; operator (see section
5), its initial translation is:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.542717">

(Me actual system may apply further transformations
(from WML into DBL), if it has to account for dis-
crepancies between the database structure and the
canonical domain model, possibly followed by further
optimizations at the DBL level.)
Other restrictions on &amp;quot;readiness&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;the readi-
ness on personnel&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the personnel readiness, or &amp;quot;a

where PREMOD is the EFL translation of the elided
relation in a noun-noun compound. (Note that if the
same preposition is used with different nouns to mark
different argument places, we need a more elaborate
notation which identifies the arguments of a function

5 IMPLICIT ARGUMENTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991841066666667">
One or more of the arguments of a relation may
be unspecified in the input sentence, while the intent
of the utterance is nevertheless that a particular ar-
gument should be filled in. The present section dis-
cusses briefly how this issue can be dealt with during
a phase of semantic processing which follows the
EFL-to-WML translation.
The most important case arises from the use of
definite descriptions in the English input sentence.
The phrase &amp;quot;the readiness of Frederick&amp;quot;, for instance,
leads to an expression which has the operator &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;
wrapped around the expression which represents
&amp;quot;readiness(es) of Frederick&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; is a pragmatic
operator, which selects the single most salient ele-
ment out of the set that it operates on.
Where the expression representing &amp;quot;readiness of
Frederick on personnel&amp;quot; would denote a set contain-
ing exactly one tuple, the expression representing
&amp;quot;readiness of Frederick&amp;quot; denotes a set containing a
number of different tuples: ones with EQUIPMENT,
PERSONNEL, OVERALL, etc., filled in as the second
argument. Eliminating the &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; operator consists in
accessing a Discourse Model to find out which of the
fillers of the second argument place is contextually
most accessible. (We assume that available discourse
referents are stored at every level of embedding in a
recursive model of discourse surface structure, such
as [9]). If none of the readiness areas were mentioned
in an accessible discourse constituent, the system
defaults to the &amp;quot;unmarked&amp;quot; readiness area. i.e..
OVERALL
Plural definite noun phrases are treated in a
similar fashion. For instance, &amp;quot;the readinesses of
Frederick&amp;quot; leads to an expression in which a prag-
matic operator selects the contextually salient multiple
element subset of the tuples in the extension of
READINESS-OF which have FREDERICK as a first
argument. In this case, if no particular subset of the
readiness areas can be construed as a discourse
referent, the system defaults to the assumption that
here the overall readiness plus the four resource
readinesses are intended. (Another possibility being
the reference to the ship&apos;s readiness history a se-
quence of past, current and projected future
readinesses.)

6 RELATION EXTENSIONS AS
ANSWERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992722">
The decision to treat relational nouns as denoting
relation extensions has an immediate consequence,
of some practical importance for question-answering
systems, concerning the way in which wh-questions
involving relational nouns are answered. For ex-
ample, the request &amp;quot;List the speeds of the ships in
the Indian Ocean.&amp;quot; could be answered in three ways,
of ascending informativeness: 1) with a set of speed
values (possibly of smaller cardinality than the set of
ships in the Indian Ocean) 2) with a bag of speed
values (of the same cardinality as the set of ships)
and 3) with a set of &lt;ship, speed&gt; ordered pairs, such
that each ship is paired off with its speed.
Clearly, 3) is most likely to be the desired
response (although it is possible to envision situations
where reponses 1) and 2) are desired). One cannot
obtain this response, however, if the semantic trans-
lation of the noun phrase &amp;quot;the speeds of the ships in
the Indian Ocean&amp;quot; does not retain the information of
which speed goes with which ship. An important ad-
vantage of our approach to the relational noun
problem is that it preserves this information, making 3)
the normal reponse and 1) and 2) derivable from it.
This may be compared to the &amp;quot;procedural
semantics&amp;quot; approach to this same problem, as found
in the work on LUNAR [14]. In this work, meaning is
regarded as procedural in nature, and quantifications
are represented in terms of nested iterations. The
request &amp;quot;List the speeds of the ships in the Indian
Ocean&amp;quot; would be represented as:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.827811666666667">
(FOR ALL X / SNIPS
: (IN X IND7.AN-OC2AN)
; (PRINT (SPRRD X) ) )
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985785714286">
where the action of this representation would be to
iterate over the class SHIPS, for each member
checking to see if it is IN the INDIAN-OCEAN, and if
so, printing its speed. The PRINT operator is made
&amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; enough to detect the occurrence of the free
variable in its argument and to add in a printout the
value of this variable for each iteration.
Note that while this representation provides for the
tuple response (3), and perhaps, if the &amp;quot;smartness&amp;quot; is
made optional, for the bag response (2), the set
response (1) would seem out of reach. In contrast,
the approach this paper presents allows for all three,
by generating as a default response the tuple set, and
then optionally &amp;quot;projecting&amp;quot; on its second column.

<bodyText confidence="0.999667333333333">
Relational nouns are of primary importance for
natural language interfaces to databases and expert
systems, since they are commonly used to refer to
database relations and to arithmetical functions. This
paper has presented a treatment of relational nouns
which manages to maintain uniformity and generality
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999515">

<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
at the level of syntactic analysis and initial semantic
interpretation. This treatment has been incorporated
into the semantic framework of BBN&apos;s Spoken Lan-
guage System without writing additional LISP code.
The semantic transformations necessary for the treat-
ment are all carried out by general algorithms which
were part of the pre-existing semantic framework. Im-
plementing the treatment consisted in writing descrip-
tive (EFL to WML) translation specifications for the
ER_ relations involved with function nouns, and a few
dozen logical transformations to supplement the exist-
ing set of simplifications.
Further work on this topic should investigate how
our perspective on relational nouns carries over to an
account of the temporal and spatial modifiers that can
be used with any noun. This will then make it possible
to explore its connections with the work on the
semantics of time-dependent nouns that has been
done in the Montague-tradition. [3] [13]

<abstract confidence="0.994011325">decribes a computational treatment of semantics of nouns. covers relational such as focuses especially on a particular subcategory of them, called nouns (&amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;). Relational nouns are usually viewed as either requiring non-compositional semantic interpretation, or causing an undesirable proliferation of syntactic rules. In contrast to this, we present a treatment which is both syntactically uniform and semantically compositional. The core ideas of this treatment are: (1) The recognition of different levels of semantic analysis; in parthe distinction between an of meaning representation. (2) The analysis of relational nouns as denoting relation-extensions. The paper shows how this approach handles a variety of linguistic constructions involving relational nouns. The treatment presented here has been implemented in BBN&apos;s Spoken Language System, an experimental spoken language interface to a database/graphics system. 1 RELATIONAL NOUNS AND THEIR DENOTATIONS When Jean Piaget faced his nine year old subject with the question a brother?&amp;quot;, answer there&apos;s a boy and another boy, when are two of them.&amp;quot; with a greater degree of formal precision, ten year old Bern replied to the same brother is a relation, one brother to &amp;quot;[2] What these children are beginning to be able to articulate is that there is something wrong with the experimenter&apos;s question as it is posed: it talks about &amp;quot;brothers&amp;quot; as if they constituted a natural kind, as if there is a way of looking at an individual to find whether he is a brother. But normally not used that way â€” a property which it shares with like &amp;quot;commander&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, of this sort are called nouns.</abstract>

The problem of the semantic interpretation of relational nouns constitutes the topic of this paper. We shall argue that this problem is indeed semantic and should preferably treated in the syntax. The semantic treatment that we present a semantics and is based the idea of assigning extensions denotations to relational nouns. Relational nouns are semantically unsaturated. They are normally used in combination with an implicit explicit &amp;quot;John&apos;s brother&amp;quot;. argument of a relational noun, if overtly realized in the sentence, is connected to the noun by means of a relationdenoting lexical element: the verb &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; or one of its semantic equivalents (the genitive and the preposi- &amp;quot;John has a sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;John&apos;s &amp;quot;a sister of John&apos;s&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a boy with a sister&amp;quot;. It been noted that these lexical items interact differently with relational nouns than they do with other nouns. Compare, for instance, the noun with the relational noun the parallel sentences (2)/(2abcd): (1) entails (1abcd), the corresponding (2) does not entail (1) &amp;quot;John&apos;s cars are wrecks.&amp;quot; wrecks of John&apos;s are cars.&amp;quot; (Ib) &amp;quot;Some wrecks are John&apos;s.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some cars (1d) &amp;quot;John has wrecks.&amp;quot; (2) &amp;quot;John&apos;s brothers are punks.&amp;quot; A particular subcategory of the relational nouns, that we shall consider in some detail, is constituted by nouns; are semantically distinct in that for every argument they refer to exactly one enwhich is an element of a linear ordering: a numrefrain from saying that (2abcd) are ungrammatical. Because the semantic open-endedness of the genitive, these sentences can certainly be wellformed and meaningful, if uttered in an appropriate context. The issue at stake is that the interpretation which is the salient one for the genitive in (2) is not available for the corresponding elements in (2abcd). Sentences displaying this property have been marked with the 4-sign (rather than the ungrammaticality-asterisk) in this paper. 25 ber, an amount, or a grade. Examples are &amp;quot;length&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;. Function nouns can be used in constructions which exclude other nouns, relational as well as non-relational. Compare, for instance: &amp;quot;The USS Frederick has of 15 knots.&amp;quot; The examples above show that there are significant semantic differences between phrases connecting relational nouns to their functions/values, and the corresponding, similarly structured phrases built around other nouns. This suggests that the standard treatment of ordinary nouns cannot be applied directly to relational nouns and yield correct results. To conclude this introductory section, we investigate this issue in a little more detail. Assume a semantic framework with the following, not very unusual, features. Nouns are analyzed as set-denoting constants; concomitantly, adjectives are analyzed as one-place predicates, prepositions as two-place predicates, verbs as n-place predicates. Plural noun phrases with &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; or a possessive denote sets which have the same semantic type as the noun which they are built denotes a particular set of cars. In this approach, the represenof the noun phrase sisters&amp;quot;would e SISTERS fPOSSESS(PETER,x)), the set of persons who are a and the possessive relation indicated by the genitive construction. Now this expression does not have the right properties. It lacks necessary information: the predi- (X POSSESS(PETER,x)) to elements the it take into acextension was defined. For instance, if in a particular world the set of sisters is co-extensional with the set of co-authors, the approach just outlined incorrectly assign to sisters&amp;quot; same as to co-authors&amp;quot;. It is clear what the source of the problem is: the semantic representations for relational nouns considered above denote simple sets of individuals, and not contain any information about the involved. To salvage a uniform compositional treatment, a richer representation is needed. One might think of Montague&apos;s concepts [6], or enriching one&apos;s ontology with qua-individuals between Mary and Mary aunt) [4]. In section 4 we will present our solution to this problem. First, we discuss why we didn&apos;t choose for a more syntactically oriented approach. 2 AGAINST SYNTACTIC TREATMENTS Often, the complexities mentioned above are taken to require a distinction between intransitive common nouns and transitive common nouns in the syntax, with a concommittant proliferation of syntactic rules. Instead, we have chosen to extend a treatment of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns only at the semantic processing stage. We shall now indicate some of the reasons for this choice. Relational nouns are semantically dependent on an argument. In this respect, they are more reminisof verbs than of standard nouns like verbs of English have one or more arplaces that filled for the verb to be used in a syntactically/semantically felicitous way; this property of verbs is probably an important reason for the persisting tendency to analyze them as n-place predicates rather than sets of situations. The semantic similarity between relational nouns and verbs has given rise to treatments which model the syntactic treatment of nouns on the treatment of verbs: one introduces lexical subcategories for nouns which indicate how many arguments they take and how these arguments are marked; the syntactic rules combine N-bars or noun-phrases with genitive phrases and preposition-phrases, taking these subcategorizations into account. [15] We will now argue, however, that from a syntactic point of view such a move is unattractive. Syntactically, relational nouns do not behave very differently from &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns. They combine with adjectives, determiners, preposition phrases and relative clauses to form noun phrases with a standard X-bar structure; and the noun phrases thus constituted can participate in all sentence-level structures that other noun phrases partake in. Also, no nouns have syntactic properties that would be analogous to the sentence-level of a verb one or more arguments. The overt realization of the arguments of a &amp;quot;transitive noun&amp;quot; is always optional. Finally, we may note that relational nouns can be connected to their arguments/values by a variety of verbs and prepositions, which constitute a semantic complex that is also used, with exactly the same structure but with a different meaning, to operate on non-relational nouns. Compare, for instance: &amp;quot;The Chevrolet of Or. Johnson&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;The speed of Frederick&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Dr. Johnson&apos;s Chevrolet&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Frederick&apos;s speed&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Chevrolet that Dr. Johnson has&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;The speed that Frederick has&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Dr. Johnson acquired a rusty Chevrolet&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Frederick acquired a formidable speed&apos; &amp;quot;A philosopher with a rusty Chevrolet&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;A ship with a formidable speed&amp;quot; The same set of terms is used in English for the 26 ownership relation, for the part-whole relation, and for the relation between a function and its argument terms (like highly polysemous, and any language processing system must encompass mechanisms for disambiguating their intended meaning in any particular utterance. To summarize: relational nouns do not distinguish themselves syntactically from other nouns, and they mark their function-argument structures by means of polysemous descriptive terms. We therefore conclude that it would be theoretically elegant as well as comeffective to treat relational nonrelational nouns identically at the syntactic level, and to account for the semantics of relational noun constructions by exploiting independently motivated disambiguation mechanisms. The remainder of this paper describes such a treatment. Section 3 discusses the semantics architecture which constitutes the framework for our approach. Section 4 presents our answer to a basic question about relational nouns: what should their denotations be? This section then goes on to describe the semantic transformations which derive the desired analyses of constructions involving relational nouns. Section 5 briefly discusses the interface with a Discourse Model, which is necessary to recover arguments of a relation that are left implicit in an utterance. Section 6 shows that our treatment is useful for the purpose of response-formulation in questionanswering. 3 MULTILEVEL SEMANTICS. Our approach to the problem of relational nouns is on the idea of semantics: distinction between different levels of semantic analysis. [1] [10] In this approach, interpreting a natural language sentence is a multi-stage process, which starts out with a high-level meaning representation which reflects the semantic structure of the English sentence rather directly, and then applies translation rules which specify how the English-oriented semantic primitives relate to the ones that are used at deeper levels of analysis. At every level of analysis, the meaning of an input utterance is represented as an expression of a logical The languages used at the various levels of analysis differ in that at every level the descriptive constants are chosen so as to correspond to the semantic primitives which are assumed at that level. At the highest semantic level, the meaning of an input utterance is represented as an expression of the Formal Language The constants of EFL correspond to the descriptive terms of Spoken Language System uses a higher-order intensional logic based on Church&apos;s lambda-calculus. combining features from PHLICA&apos;s logical language (51 with kiontague&apos;s Intensional Logic (6]. English. A feature of ER which is both unusual and important, is the fact that descriptive constants are to be each syntactic category, every word is represented in ER by a single descriptive constant, no matter how many senses the word may have. An ER expression can thus be seen an expression every constant can be expanded out in a possibly large number of different ways. (See [5] for details on the model theory of such a logic.) The ambiguity of ER_ follows from its domainindependence. All descriptive words of a language are polysemous, and only when used in the context of a particular subject domain do they acquire a single precise meaning â€” a meaning which cannot be articulated independently of that subject domain. Even within one subject domain, many words have a range of different meanings. Joint representations for such sets of possible expansions are computationally advantageous; and when the range of possibilities is defined in an open-ended way. they are even necessary. Such cases occur when we attempt to account for the interpretation of metonymy, metaphor and nominal compounds [12], or the interpretation of multilevel plural noun phrases [11]. The logical language used at the domainlevel of representation is called the Language This is an unambiguous language, with an ordinary model-theoretic interpretation. Its constants are chosen to correspond to the conwhich constitute the domain of We can illustrate the distinction between ER and WML by means of an example involving relational nouns. Compare (4) and (5) below. Sentence (4) will be translated into something like (4) &amp;quot;John has a house in Hawaii.&amp;quot; e (he HOUSES! IN(h,HAWAII)): HAVE(JOHN,h) Now consider (5) instead; a single-level architecture would have to analyse this sentence as (5b) rather than (5a), since (5b) is the representation one would prefer to end up with. &amp;quot;Frederick has of 15 knots.&amp;quot; OF(c, HAVE(FREDERICK,c) smooth interface with application systems, there is a third level of semantic interpretation. The language at this level is called the Base Language Its constants stand for the files and attributes of the database to be and the available graphics system operations parameters. discourse anaphora may motivate a different treatment of the indefinite noun phrase. representing its semantics by a Skolefr-constant or a similar device, rather than by the traditional quantifier. For discussion we may ignore this issue. 27 F-SPEED(FREDERICK) In a multilevel semantics architecture, however, one would prefer to maintain a completely uniform first stage in the semantic interpretation process, where (5) would be treated exactly as (4), and therefore be analyzed as (5a). By applying appropriate EFL-to- WML translation rules, the EFL expression (5a) would then be transformed into the WML expression (5b). Taking natural language at semantic face value thus simplifies the process of creating an initial meaning representation. The remaining question then is, whether one can in fact write EFL-to-WML translation rules which yield the desired results. This is the question we will come back to in section 4. In the remainder of the present section, we first give some more detail on the general properties of the translation rules and the logical languages. The interpretive rules which map syntactic struconto EFL expressions are they correspond in a direct way to the syntactic rules which define the legal input strings. There is a methodological reason for this emphasis on cornpositionality: it makes it possible to guarantee that all possible combinations between syntactic rules are in fact covered by the interpretive rules, and to minimize surprises about the way the rules interact. Similar considerations apply when we think about the definition of the EFL-to-WML translation: we wish to guarantee that the WML translations of every EFL expression are defined in an effectively computable way, and that the different rules which together specify the translation interact in a predictable fashion. This is achieved by specifying the EFL-to-WML using strictly rules operating on specify for every ER. constant the WML expressions that it translates into. Translation by means of local rules, which expand constants into complex expressions, tends to create fairly large and complicated formulas. The result of the EFL-to-WML translation is therefore processed by a logical simplification module; this keeps formulas from becoming too unwieldy to handle and impossible to evaluate. Local rules by themselves do not specify what combinations between them will lead to legitimate results. Since the rules can be applied independently of each other, we need a separate mechanism for checking the meaningfulness of their combined opera- This mechanism is the type system. WML and DBL are This means that for every expression of these languages, a semantic type is defined. The denotation of an expression is guaranteed to be a member of the set denoted by its type. In WML, for instance, the type denotes the of all ships; the denotes the set of all locahave the type (SHIPS) denotes the powerset of the set all ships; the type FUNCTIONS(U(SHIPS,PLANES, LAND-VEHICLES), AMOUNTS(SPEED-UNITS)), which denotes the set of functions whose domain is the union of the sets of ships, of planes and of land vehicles, and whose range is the set of amountexpressions whose units are members of the set of speed-units. Given the types of the constants occurring in it, the type of a complex expression is determined by formal rules. For instance, the expression have the type rules which define the types of complex expressions also define when an does a legitimate type, and is therefore not considered to be a bona fide member of language. For instance, not have a legitimate type, because the typecomputation rule for function-application expressions requires that the type of the argument not be disjoint with the domain of the function. The semantic type constraints make it possible to express the possible interpretations of ambiguous ER. constants by means of local translation rules, without running the danger of creating spurious nonsensical combinations. For instance, if &amp;quot;Guam&amp;quot; were the name of a ship as well as the name of a location, could be one ER. constant WML-expansions: type type Applying the EFL-to-WML rules to nevertheless yield only since the other combination would be deemed illegitimate. In the next section we show how relational noun denotations and EFL-to-WML translations may be chosen in such a way that sentences involving relational nouns after an initially uniform treatment end up with plausible truth conditions â€” so that, for instance, (5) above can be initially analyzed as (5a) and then translated into (5b) in a principled way. 4 MULTILEVEL SEMANTICS FOR RELATIONAL NOUNS The treatment we propose is based on a simple, yet powerful idea: analyse a relational noun as denotthe the corresponding relation set of pairs that allow predicates to apply not only to individuals but also to As an example, consider again the phrase sisters.&amp;quot; we discussed in section 1 above. In the treatment we propose, this phrase would get the ER. analysis (6a). We assume relations. &lt;x,y&gt; is a pair in a we call y the 28 (6) &amp;quot;Peter&apos;s sisters&amp;quot; (6a) (x e R-SISTER POSSESS(PETER,x)), the denotes the extension of the sister-relation, and as one of its types: ((U(MALES,FEMALES) TRUTH VALUES). (6a) can be transformed into a plausible expression for (6) by applying the translation rule: POSSESS =&gt; (X u,v: u = v(1 j) type v has type this rule to (6a) yields after 13-reduction: (6b) (x e R-SISTER I PETER a 41J), which is equivalent to: (6c) (u,v u = PETER &amp; R-S1STER(u,v)) Thus, we see that by allowing the semantic transof select over pairs consisting of a person and the sister of that person, we can end up a representation of sisters&amp;quot; comes close to having the right denotation: it denotes the correct set of persons, but they are still paired up with Peter. This &amp;quot;extra information&amp;quot; is of course a problem. instance, sisters are Mary&apos;s aunts.&amp;quot; asserts the equality of two sets of persons, not two sets of pairs of persons. It turns out that we have two distinct cases to deal with: to account for the interaction between a relational noun and the phrases which indicate its arguments and values, we would like to treat it as denoting a relation-extension; but to account for its interaction with everything else, we would like to treat it as denoting a set of individuals. In order to make the relational treatment yield the right results, we must assume that part of the meaning of ordinary descriptive predicates is an implicit projection-operator, which projects tuples onto their value-elements. This is the solution we adopt. We formalize it by means of a meaning-postulate schema which applies to every is not among a small number of exnoted exceptions: V F(x) Ffry,x&gt;) copula not an exception to this meaning postulate schema: it operates on values rather relation-elements. This is the reason why available as an argument for (2ac) punks of John&apos;s are brothers.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some brothers are John&apos;s&amp;quot;) We shall now consider the actual EFL-to-WML the set of pairs that in denotation of y is in the denotation of a translation rules which handle the relational nouns in a little more detail. The EFL relations have many different translations into WML; which ones are relevant in a given case, is decided by considering the semantic types of the arguments to which they are applied. Consider again, for example, the part of the EFL-to-WML translation rules that deals with the interpretation of the possessive relation as specifying a argument, as in sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Frederick&apos;s speed&amp;quot;: =&gt; u,v: u v[11) type v has type a local translation rule, this rule could applied to any occurrence of an EFL formula. However, many such applications would give rise to semantically anomalous WML formulas (with necessarily denotationless sub-expressions) which are filtered out if there are any other non-anomalous interpretations. For instance, the above rule for yield an anomalous expression if to the representation of bethe ER_ constant not denote a set of pairs but a set of individual entities. It would also an anomalous expression if applied to USS sisters*, the type of the EFL conis disjoint with the type of is U(MALES,FEMALES). To avoid spurious generation of anomalous expressions, the semantic types of the arguments of an ER. function or EFL relation are checked before the EFL-to-WML rule for that function or relation is ap- For instance, the above rule for only be applied to an expression of the form A types a and that P,0: P). As noted above, the interdefinability which exists &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;, genitive, and they are used, for instance, in reference to ownership, carries over to their use for indicating the relation between a relational noun and its argument. Thus, the representations of &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;, WML translations which, modulo the order of their arare all identical to the rule for discussed above. nouns, a special interpretation on preposition phrases with phrases can be used to connect the funcnoun with its treatment of relational nouns sketched in the previous section can also accommodate this phenomenon, as we shall show now. Consider example (7) below, which is identical to (5) above. It gets, in the treatment we propose, the ER. analysis (5a); this analysis is exactly analogous to the one that a syntactically similar sentence involving a non-relational noun would get. (Cf. (4) and (4a).) 29 has a speed of 15 knots.&amp;quot; 3 e (s e F-SPEED I OF(s,amount(15, KNOTS))): HAVE(FREDERICK,$) It is the task of the EFL-to-WML translation rules to define a transformation on ER_ expressions which would turn (5a) into (5b) or a logically equivalent formula. (7b) F-SPEED(FREDERICK) . KNOTS) To achieve the desired result, we need a rule for is precisely analogous to the rule for and we need a rule for is to the rule for of 15 knots&amp;quot; unlike speed of the USS that in the former case we must connect relation with its than its argument. rule for we need here is as follows: ..&gt; (X u,v: up) = Note that different rules for one EFL constant can coexist without conflict, because of the assumption of lexical ambiguity in EFL. (In the general case, an EFL expression will have several WML expansions for this reason; often, many rule-applications will be blocked by semantic type-checking.) This basic approach makes it possible to transform the EFL representation of any of the constructions shown in the examples in section 1 into reasonable World Model Language and Data Base Language formulations of the intended query. We shall illustrate the process of applying the EFL-to-WML translations and logical simplifications in a little more detail while showing how to extend this treatment to function nouns which can take more than one argument. Such nouns interact with specific kinds of preposition phrases to pick up their arguments. For distance to Hawaii&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the disfrom Hawaii to Guam&amp;quot;. As example, we will discuss the noun used in the U.S. Navy, which designates a two-argument function. used in the Navy battle management domain, refers to the degree to which a vessel to be more precise, a unitis prepared for combat or for a specific mission. This degree is indicated on a five-point scale, using either c-codes (Cl to C5), if referring to combat readiness, or m-codes (M1 to M5), if referring to mission readiness. The readiness for can furthermore overall readiness (the default case) or the readiness with respect to one of four resource readiness areas: personnel, training, equipment or supplies. Therefore, a function which maps two aran element of and element of as an example the noun phrase of Frederick&amp;quot;. we ignore for the moment the effect of the &amp;quot;singular the&amp;quot; operator (see section 5), its initial translation is: OF(x, FREDERICK)) The parts of this expression are translated as follows. A logical transformation translates the functionthe following equivalent expression, which will be convenient for subsequent processing: e (READINESS-OF) I READINESS-OF(411). 42)) which in its turn is equivalent to I READINESS-OF(41J) . 4211 relation eliminated in the EFL-to-WML by a of the translation rule mentioned above. It transforms FREDERICK) The net result of these logical and descriptive transformations is the following expression: e (z e (SHIPS I READINESS-OF(41J) . 421) I 41l11 . FREDERICK) This expression is then simplified to: e I READINESS-OF(41j) . 421) which in its turn can be transformed into a logically but more optimally evaluable (A. &lt;x, READINESS-OF(x)&gt;)) (Me actual system may apply further transformations (from WML into DBL), if it has to account for discrepancies between the database structure and the canonical domain model, possibly followed by further optimizations at the DBL level.) restrictions on in readion personnel&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;the personnelreadiness, readiness&amp;quot;, handled in an analogous manner: ON .&gt; (X u,v: 411(2). v) PREMOD .&gt; (A, u,v: Wig . v) .&gt; (X u,v: u(21. the EFL translation of the elided relation in a noun-noun compound.

(for: A, apply: F) denotes the beg containing the results of all applications of the function F to elements of the set A. 30 Because of the essentially local character of the transformations on OF, ON, and the completely general character of the simplifications dealing with intersections of sets and tuples, a small number of transformations (a few for each EFL relation) covers a wide variety of expressions. 5 IMPLICIT ARGUMENTS. One or more of the arguments of a relation may be unspecified in the input sentence, while the intent of the utterance is nevertheless that a particular argument should be filled in. The present section discusses briefly how this issue can be dealt with during a phase of semantic processing which follows the EFL-to-WML translation. The most important case arises from the use of descriptions the English input sentence. The phrase &amp;quot;the readiness of Frederick&amp;quot;, for instance, leads to an expression which has the operator &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; wrapped around the expression which represents &amp;quot;readiness(es) of Frederick&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; is a pragmatic operator, which selects the single most salient element out of the set that it operates on. Where the expression representing &amp;quot;readiness of Frederick on personnel&amp;quot; would denote a set containing exactly one tuple, the expression representing &amp;quot;readiness of Frederick&amp;quot; denotes a set containing a of different tuples: ones with OVERALL, filled in as the second argument. Eliminating the &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; operator consists in a Model find out which of the fillers of the second argument place is contextually most accessible. (We assume that available discourse referents are stored at every level of embedding in a recursive model of discourse surface structure, such as [9]). If none of the readiness areas were mentioned in an accessible discourse constituent, the system defaults to the &amp;quot;unmarked&amp;quot; readiness area. i.e.. OVERALL definite noun phrases treated in a similar fashion. For instance, &amp;quot;the readinesses of Frederick&amp;quot; leads to an expression in which a pragoperator selects the contextually salient subset the tuples in the extension of have a first argument. In this case, if no particular subset of the readiness areas can be construed as a discourse referent, the system defaults to the assumption that here the overall readiness plus the four resource readinesses are intended. (Another possibility being reference to the ship&apos;s readiness sequence of past, current and projected future readinesses.) 6 RELATION EXTENSIONS AS ANSWERS. The decision to treat relational nouns as denoting relation extensions has an immediate consequence, of some practical importance for question-answering systems, concerning the way in which wh-questions involving relational nouns are answered. For exthe request the speeds of the ships in Indian Ocean.&amp;quot; be answered in three ways, of ascending informativeness: 1) with a set of speed values (possibly of smaller cardinality than the set of ships in the Indian Ocean) 2) with a bag of speed values (of the same cardinality as the set of ships) and 3) with a set of &lt;ship, speed&gt; ordered pairs, such that each ship is paired off with its speed. Clearly, 3) is most likely to be the desired response (although it is possible to envision situations where reponses 1) and 2) are desired). One cannot obtain this response, however, if the semantic transof the noun phrase speeds of the ships in Indian Ocean&amp;quot; not retain the information of which speed goes with which ship. An important advantage of our approach to the relational noun problem is that it preserves this information, making 3) the normal reponse and 1) and 2) derivable from it. This may be compared to the &amp;quot;procedural semantics&amp;quot; approach to this same problem, as found in the work on LUNAR [14]. In this work, meaning is regarded as procedural in nature, and quantifications are represented in terms of nested iterations. The the speeds of the ships in the Indian would represented as: (FOR ALL X / SNIPS : (IN X IND7.AN-OC2AN) ; (PRINT (SPRRD X) ) ) where the action of this representation would be to over the class each member to see if it is if so, printing its speed. The PRINT operator is made &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; enough to detect the occurrence of the free variable in its argument and to add in a printout the value of this variable for each iteration. Note that while this representation provides for the tuple response (3), and perhaps, if the &amp;quot;smartness&amp;quot; is made optional, for the bag response (2), the set response (1) would seem out of reach. In contrast, the approach this paper presents allows for all three, by generating as a default response the tuple set, and then optionally &amp;quot;projecting&amp;quot; on its second column. Relational nouns are of primary importance for natural language interfaces to databases and expert systems, since they are commonly used to refer to database relations and to arithmetical functions. This paper has presented a treatment of relational nouns which manages to maintain uniformity and generality 31 at the level of syntactic analysis and initial semantic interpretation. This treatment has been incorporated into the semantic framework of BBN&apos;s Spoken Language System without writing additional LISP code. The semantic transformations necessary for the treatment are all carried out by general algorithms which were part of the pre-existing semantic framework. Implementing the treatment consisted in writing descriptive (EFL to WML) translation specifications for the ER_ relations involved with function nouns, and a few dozen logical transformations to supplement the existing set of simplifications. Further work on this topic should investigate how our perspective on relational nouns carries over to an account of the temporal and spatial modifiers that can be used with any noun. This will then make it possible to explore its connections with the work on the semantics of time-dependent nouns that has been done in the Montague-tradition.

It is clear what the source of the problem is: the semantic representations for relational nouns considered above denote simple sets of individuals, and do not contain any information about the relation involved. To salvage a uniform compositional treatment, a richer representation is needed. One might think of invoking Montague&apos;s individual concepts [3] [6], or enriching one&apos;s ontology with qua-individuals (distinguishing between Mary qua sister and Mary qua aunt) [4]. In section 4 we will present our solution to this problem. First, we discuss why we didn&apos;t choose for a more syntactically oriented approach. 2 AGAINST SYNTACTIC TREATMENTS Often, the complexities mentioned above are taken to require a distinction between intransitive common nouns and transitive common nouns in the syntax, with a concommittant proliferation of syntactic rules. Instead, we have chosen to extend a treatment of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns only at the semantic processing stage. We shall now indicate some of the reasons for this choice.

They are normally used in combination with an implicit or explicit argument: &amp;quot;John&apos;s brother&amp;quot;. The argument of a relational noun, if overtly realized in the sentence, is connected to the noun by means of a relationdenoting lexical element: the verb &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; or one of its semantic equivalents (the genitive and the prepositions &amp;quot;or and &amp;quot;with): &amp;quot;John has a sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;John&apos;s sister&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a sister of John&apos;s&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a boy with a sister&amp;quot;. It has been noted that these lexical items interact differently with relational nouns than they do with other nouns. [7] Compare, for instance, the noun &amp;quot;car&amp;quot; in (1)/(1abcd) with the relational noun &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; in the parallel sentences (2)/(2abcd): (1) entails (1abcd), but the corresponding (2) does not entail (2abcd).2 (1) &amp;quot;John&apos;s cars are wrecks.&amp;quot; (/a) &amp;quot;Some wrecks of John&apos;s are cars.&amp;quot; (Ib) &amp;quot;Some wrecks are John&apos;s.&amp;quot; (1c) &amp;quot;Some cars are John&apos;s.&amp;quot; (1d) &amp;quot;John has wrecks.&amp;quot; (2) &amp;quot;John&apos;s brothers are punks.&amp;quot; #(2a) *Some punks of John&apos;s are brothers.&amp;quot; #(2b) &amp;quot;Some punks are John&apos;s.&amp;quot; #(2c) &amp;quot;Some brothers are John&apos;s.&amp;quot; #(2d) &amp;quot;John has punks.&amp;quot; A particular subcategory of the relational nouns, that we shall consider in some </context>

But &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; is normally not used that way â€” a property which it shares with words like &amp;quot;co-author&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;commander&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;rating&amp;quot;.

Eliminating the &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; operator consists in accessing a Discourse Model to find out which of the fillers of the second argument place is contextually most accessible. (We assume that available discourse referents are stored at every level of embedding in a recursive model of discourse surface structure, such as [9]). If none of the readiness areas were mentioned in an accessible discourse constituent, the system defaults to the &amp;quot;unmarked&amp;quot; readiness area. i.e.. OVERALL Plural definite noun phrases are treated in a similar fashion. For instance, &amp;quot;the readinesses of Frederick&amp;quot; leads to an expression in which a pragmatic operator selects the contextually salient multiple element subset of the tuples in the extension of READINESS-OF which have FREDERICK as a first argument.

This section then goes on to describe the semantic transformations which derive the desired analyses of constructions involving relational nouns. Section 5 briefly discusses the interface with a Discourse Model, which is necessary to recover arguments of a relation that are left implicit in an utterance. Section 6 shows that our treatment is useful for the purpose of response-formulation in questionanswering. 3 MULTILEVEL SEMANTICS. Our approach to the problem of relational nouns is based on the idea of multilevel semantics: the distinction between different levels of semantic analysis. [1] [10] In this approach, interpreting a natural language sentence is a multi-stage process, which starts out with a high-level meaning representation which reflects the semantic structure of the English sentence rather directly, and then applies translation rules which specify how the English-oriented semantic primitives relate to the ones that are used at deeper levels of analysis. At every level of analysis, the meaning of an input utterance is represented as an expression of a logical language.3 The languages used at the various levels of analysis differ in that at every level the descriptive con</context>

One cannot obtain this response, however, if the semantic translation of the noun phrase &amp;quot;the speeds of the ships in the Indian Ocean&amp;quot; does not retain the information of which speed goes with which ship. An important advantage of our approach to the relational noun problem is that it preserves this information, making 3) the normal reponse and 1) and 2) derivable from it. This may be compared to the &amp;quot;procedural semantics&amp;quot; approach to this same problem, as found in the work on LUNAR [14]. In this work, meaning is regarded as procedural in nature, and quantifications are represented in terms of nested iterations. The request &amp;quot;List the speeds of the ships in the Indian Ocean&amp;quot; would be represented as: (FOR ALL X / SNIPS : (IN X IND7.AN-OC2AN) ; (PRINT (SPRRD X) ) ) where the action of this representation would be to iterate over the class SHIPS, for each member checking to see if it is IN the INDIAN-OCEAN, and if so, printing its speed.

The semantic similarity between relational nouns and verbs has given rise to treatments which model the syntactic treatment of nouns on the treatment of verbs: one introduces lexical subcategories for nouns which indicate how many arguments they take and how these arguments are marked; the syntactic rules combine N-bars or noun-phrases with genitive phrases and preposition-phrases, taking these subcategorizations into account. [15] We will now argue, however, that from a syntactic point of view such a move is unattractive. Syntactically, relational nouns do not behave very differently from &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; nouns. They combine with adjectives, determiners, preposition phrases and relative clauses to form noun phrases with a standard X-bar structure; and the noun phrases thus constituted can participate in all sentence-level structures that other noun phrases partake in. Also, no nouns have syntactic properties that would be analogous to the sentence-level phenomenon of a verb obligatorily taking one or more arguments. The over</context>
