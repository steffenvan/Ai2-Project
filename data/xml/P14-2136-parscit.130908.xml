Event extraction generally suffers from the
data sparseness problem. In this paper, we
address this problem by utilizing the labeled
data from two different languages. As a pre-
liminary study, we mainly focus on the sub-
task of trigger type determination in event
extraction. To make the training data in dif-
ferent languages help each other, we pro-
pose a uniform text representation with bi-
lingual features to represent the samples and
handle the difficulty of locating the triggers
in the translated text from both monolingual
and bilingual perspectives. Empirical studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed approach to bilingual classification on
trigger type determination.

Event extraction is an increasingly hot and chal-
lenging research topic in the natural language
processing (NLP) community (Ahn, 2006; Saun
et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008). It aims to automat-
ically extract certain types of events with the ar-
guments to present the texts under a structured
form. In event extraction, there are four primary
subtasks, named trigger identification, trigger
type determination, argument identification, and
argument role determination (Chen and NG,
2012). As an important technology in infor-
mation extraction, event extraction could be ap-
plied to many fields such as information retrieval,
summarization, text mining, and question an-
swering.
Recently, the dominative approach to event
extraction is based on supervised learning where
a set of labeled samples are exploited to train a
model to extract the events. However, the availa-

ble labeled data are rather sparse due to various
kinds of event categories. For example, the event
taxonomy in ACE 2005 1 (Automatic Content
Extraction) includes 8 types of events, with 33
subtypes, such as “Marry/Life” (subtype/type),
and “Transport/Movement”. Moreover, some
subtypes such as “Nominate/Personnel” and
“Convict/Justice” contain less than 10 labeled
samples in the English and Chinese corpus re-
spectively. Apparently, such a small scale of
training data is difficult to yield a satisfying per-
formance.
One possible way to alleviate the data sparse-
ness problem in event extraction is to conduct
bilingual event extraction with training data from
two different languages. This is motivated by the
fact that labeled data from a language is highly
possible to convey similar information in another
language. For example, E1 is an event sample
from the English corpus and E2 is another one in
the Chinese corpus. Apparently, E1 and the Eng-
lish translation text of E2, share some important
clues such as meet and Iraq which highly indi-
cates the event type of “Meet/Contact”.
E1: Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Sat-
urday, when he also briefly met German chancel-
lor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to the
Iraq war had soured his relationship with Wash-
ington, at a dinner hosted by Putin.

talks the two sides.)

cessing approach which aims to exploit bilingual
training data to enhance the extraction perfor-
mance in each language. As a preliminary work,
we mainly focus on the subtask of trigger type
determination. Accordingly, our goal is to design
a classifier which is trained with labeled data
from two different languages and is capable of
classifying the test data from both languages.
Generally, this task possesses two main chal-
lenges.
The first challenge is text representation,
namely, how to eliminate the language gap be-
tween the two languages. To tackle this, we first
employ Google Translate2, a state-of-the-art ma-
chine translation system, to gain the translation
of an event instance, similar to what has been
widely done by previous studies in bilingual
classification tasks e.g., Wan (2008); Then, we
uniformly represent each text with bilingual
word features. That is, we augment each original
feature vector into a novel one which contains
the translated features.
The second challenge is the translation for
some specific features. It is well-known that
some specific features, such as the triggers and
their context features, are extremely important
for determining the event types. For example, in
E3, both trigger “left” and named entity “Sad-
dam” are important features to tell the event type,
i.e., &amp;quot;Transport/Movement&amp;quot;. When it is translated
to Chinese, it is also required to know trigger “离
开”(left) and named entity “萨达姆” (Saddam)
in E4, the Chinese translation of E3.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96464925">
However, it is normally difficult to know
which words are the triggers and surrounding
entities in the translated sentence. To tackle this
issue, we propose to locate the trigger from both
monolingual and bilingual perspectives in the
translation text. Empirical studies demonstrate
that adding the translation of these specific fea-
tures substantially improves the classification
performance.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 overviews the related work on
event extraction. Section 3 proposes our ap-

In the NLP community, event extraction has
been mainly studied in both English and Chinese.
In English, various supervised learning ap-
proaches have been explored recently. Bethard
and Martin (2006) formulate the event identifica-
tion as a classification problem in a word-
chunking paradigm, introducing a variety of lin-
guistically motivated features. Ahn (2006) pro-
poses a trigger-based method. It first identifies
the trigger in an event, and then uses a multi-
classifier to implement trigger type determina-
tion. Ji and Grishman (2008) employ an ap-
proach to propagate consistent event arguments
across sentences and documents. Liao and
Grishman (2010) apply document level infor-
mation to improve the performance of event ex-
traction. Hong et al. (2011) leverage cross-entity
information to improve traditional event extrac-
tion, regarding entity type consistency as a key
feature. More recently, Li et al. (2013) propose a
joint framework based on structured prediction
which extracts triggers and arguments together.
In Chinese, relevant studies in event extraction
are in a relatively primary stage with focus on
more special characteristics and challenges. Tan
et al. (2008) employ local feature selection and
explicit discrimination of positive and negative
features to ensure the performance of trigger type
determination. Chen and Ji (2009) apply lexical,
syntactic and semantic features in trigger label-
ing and argument labeling to improve the per-
formance. More recently, Li et al. (2012) and Li
et al. (2013) introduce two inference mechanisms
to infer unknown triggers and recover trigger
mentions respectively with morphological struc-
tures.
In comparison with above studies, we focus on
bilingual event extraction. Although bilingual
classification has been paid lots of attention in
other fields (Wan 2008; Haghighi et al., 2008;
Ismail et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011;Li et al.,
2013), there is few related work in event extrac-
tion. The only one related work we find is Ji
(2009) which proposes an inductive learning ap-
proach to exploit cross-lingual predicate clusters
to improve the event extraction task with the
main goal to get the event taggers from extra re-
sources, i.e., an English and Chinese parallel
corpus. Differently, our goal is to make the la-

without any other extra resources, which is origi-
nal in the study of event extraction.

<bodyText confidence="0.999881">
Trigger type determination aims to determine the
event type of a trigger given the trigger and its
context (e.g., a sentence). Existing approaches to
trigger type determination mainly focus on mon-
olingual classification. Figure 1 illustrates the
framework for Chinese and English.
In comparison, our approach exploits the cor-
pora from two different languages. Figure 2 illus-
trates the framework. As shown in the figure, we
first get the translated corpora of Chinese and
English origin corpora through machine transla-
tion. Then, we represent each text with bilingual
features, which enables us to merge the training
data from both languages so as to make them
help each other.

In a supervised learning approach, labeled data is
trained to obtain a classifier. In this approach, the
extracted features are the key components to
make a successful classifier. Table 1 shows some
typical kinds of features in a monolingual classi-
fication task for trigger type determination. To
better understand these features, the real feature

<bodyText confidence="0.9779999375">
Without loss of generality, we consider the case
of translating a Chinese event sample into an
English one. Formally, the word sequence of a
Chinese event sample is denoted as
sc _ (cl, cz, ,c„) , while the sequence of the
translated one is denoted as se = (e1, e2 ,em) .
Then, the objective is to get the English trigger

Trig in . The objective function is given as fol-
lows:

In this paper, the above function could be
solved in two perspectives: monolingual and bi-
lingual ones. The former uses the English train-
ing data alone to locate the trigger while the lat-
ter exploit the bilingual information to get the
translated counterpart of the Chinese trigger.
The monolingual perspective: The objective
is to locate the trigger with the monolingual in-
formation. That is,

this can be solved from a standard word align-

In this section, we evaluate the performance of
our approach to bilingual classification on trigger
type determination. For comparison, following
approaches are implemented:
➢ Monolingual: perform monolingual classi-
fication on the Chinese and English corpus
individually, as shown in Figure 1.
➢ Bilingual: perform bilingual classification
with partial bilingual features, ignoring the
context features (e.g., context words, con-
text entities) under the assumption that the
trigger location task is not done.
➢ Bilingual_location: perform bilingual clas-
sification by translating each sample into
another language and using a uniform repre-
sentation with all bilingual features as
shown in Section 3.2. This is exactly our
approach. The number of the context words
and entities before or after the trigger words

Figure 3 shows the classification results of the

bilingual corpus. Specifically, the improvement
by our approach in Chinese is impressive, reach-
ing 7.6%. The results also demonstrate the im-
portance of the operation of the trigger location,

without which, bilingual classification can only
slightly improve the performance, as shown in
the English test data.
The results demonstrate that our bilingual
classification approaches are more effective for
the Chinese data. This is understandable because
the size of English data is much larger than that
of Chinese data, 5285 vs. 2710, as shown in Ta-
ble 2. Specifically, after checking the results in
each subtype, we find that some subtypes in Chi-
nese have very few samples while corresponding
subtypes in English have a certain number sam-
ples. For example, the subtype of
“Elect/Personnel” only contains 30 samples in
the Chinese data while 161 samples can be found
in the English data, which leads a very high im-
provement (15.4%) for the Chinese test data. In
summary, our bilingual classification approach
provides an effective way to handle the data
sparseness problem in even extraction.

This paper addresses the data sparseness problem
in event extraction by proposing a bilingual clas-
sification approach. In this approach, we use a
uniform text representation with bilingual fea-
tures and merge the training samples from both
languages to enlarge the size of the labeled data.
Furthermore, we handle the difficulty of locating
the trigger from both the monolingual and bilin-
gual perspectives. Empirical studies show that
our approach is effective in using bilingual cor-
pus to improve monolingual classification in
trigger type determination.
Bilingual event extraction is still in its early
stage and many related research issues need to be
investigated in the future work. For example, it is
required to propose novel approaches to the bi-
lingual processing tasks in other subtasks of
event extraction. Moreover, it is rather challeng-
ing to consider a whole bilingual processing
framework when all these subtasks are involved
together.

<abstract confidence="0.999484529411765">Event extraction generally suffers from the data sparseness problem. In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing the labeled data from two different languages. As a preliminary study, we mainly focus on the subtask of trigger type determination in event extraction. To make the training data in different languages help each other, we propose a uniform text representation with bilingual features to represent the samples and handle the difficulty of locating the triggers in the translated text from both monolingual and bilingual perspectives. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to bilingual classification on trigger type determination.</abstract>

Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to bilingual classification on trigger type determination. 1 Introduction Event extraction is an increasingly hot and challenging research topic in the natural language processing (NLP) community (Ahn, 2006; Saun et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008). It aims to automatically extract certain types of events with the arguments to present the texts under a structured form. In event extraction, there are four primary subtasks, named trigger identification, trigger type determination, argument identification, and argument role determination (Chen and NG, 2012). As an important technology in information extraction, event extraction could be applied to many fields such as information retrieval, summarization, text mining, and question answering.

The only one related work we find is Ji (2009) which proposes an inductive learning approach to exploit cross-lingual predicate clusters to improve the event extraction task with the main goal to get the event taggers from extra resources, i.e., an English and Chinese parallel corpus. Differently, our goal is to make the la843 beled data from two languages help each other without any other extra resources, which is original in the study of event extraction. 3 The Proposed Approach Trigger type determination aims to determine the</context>

Then, we estimate P( e, , = Tri ) as follows: 1 5 k, l m ( ek l =Trie |se,Re) Where 0.9 is an empirical value which makes the translation probability become a dominative factor when the translation of the trigger is found in the translated sentence. is a small value which makes the sum of all probabilities equals 1.

Accordingly, our goal is to design a classifier which is trained with labeled data from two different languages and is capable of classifying the test data from both languages. Generally, this task possesses two main challenges. The first challenge is text representation, namely, how to eliminate the language gap between the two languages. To tackle this, we first employ Google Translate2, a state-of-the-art machine translation system, to gain the translation of an event instance, similar to what has been widely done by previous studies in bilingual classification tasks e.g., Wan (2008); Then, we uniformly represent each text with bilingual word features. That is, we augment each original feature vector into a novel one which contains the translated features. The second challenge is the translation for some specific features. It is well-known that some specific features, such as the triggers and their context features, are extremely important for determining the event types. For example, in E3, both trigger “left” and named entity “Saddam” are important features to tell the event type, i.e., &amp;quot;Transport/Movement&amp;quot;.

To make the training data in different languages help each other, we propose a uniform text representation with bilingual features to represent the samples and handle the difficulty of locating the triggers in the translated text from both monolingual and bilingual perspectives. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to bilingual classification on trigger type determination. 1 Introduction Event extraction is an increasingly hot and challenging research topic in the natural language processing (NLP) community (Ahn, 2006; Saun et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008). It aims to automatically extract certain types of events with the arguments to present the texts under a structured form. In event extraction, there are four primary subtasks, named trigger identification, trigger type determination, argument identification, and argument role determination (Chen and NG, 2012). As an important technology in information extraction, event extraction could be applied to many fields such as information retrieval, summarization, text mining, and question answering. Recently, the dominative approach to event extraction is based on supervised learning where a set of</context>
