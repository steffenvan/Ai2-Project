We present a city navigation and tourist
information mobile dialogue app with in-
tegrated question-answering (QA) and ge-
ographic information system (GIS) mod-
ules that helps pedestrian users to nav-
igate in and learn about urban environ-
ments. In contrast to existing mobile apps
which treat these problems independently,
our Android app addresses the prob-
lem of navigation and touristic question-
answering in an integrated fashion using
a shared dialogue context. We evaluated
our system in comparison with Samsung
S-Voice (which interfaces to Google nav-
igation and Google search) with 17 users
and found that users judged our system to
be significantly more interesting to inter-
act with and learn from. They also rated
our system above Google search (with the
Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist in-
formation tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999904857142857">
We present a mobile dialogue system (an Android
app) called Spacebook that addresses the problem
of pedestrian navigation and tourist information in
urban environments. There has been little prior
work that addresses these two problems - naviga-
tion and tourist information provision - in an inte-
grated way. By navigation, we refer to the prob-
lem of finding appropriate destinations to go to
and the task of wayfinding to reach them and by
tourist information provision we refer to the prob-
lem of meeting the informational needs of a user
about entities such as museums, statues and fa-
mous personalities. A dialogue system such as this
could serve as a personal tour guide to pedestrian
tourists as they walk around unknown cities. With
the proliferation of smartphones, there has been a
number of mobile apps developed to address these
problems. However these apps have the following
problems: first, they demand the user’s visual at-
tention because they predominantly present infor-
mation on a mobile screen. This can be dangerous
in urban environments, as well as being distract-
ing. Second, these apps address the problems of
navigation and tourist information independently
and therefore do not have a shared interaction con-
text. This means that users cannot switch between
information and navigation tasks in a natural and
fluid manner.

In contrast to many existing mobile apps,
Spacebook has a speech-only interface and ad-
dresses both problems in an integrated way. We
conjecture that with a speech-only interface, users
can immerse themselves in exploring the city,
and that because of the shared context they can
switch between navigation and tourist information
tasks more easily. Using the navigational context,
Spacebook pushes point-of-interest information
which can then initiate tourist information tasks
using the QA module. Table 1 presents an example

ities. Utterances System4-8 show the system’s ca-
pability to push information about nearby points-
of-interest (PoI) during a navigation task and an-
swer followup questions using the QA system (in
utterances User2 and User3). The final 3 utter-
ances show a natural switch between navigation to
an entity and QA about that entity.
We investigate whether our system using a com-
bination of geographical information system (GIS)
and natural language processing (NLP) technolo-
gies would be a better companion to pedestrian
city explorers than the current state-of-the-art mo-
bile apps. We hypothesize that, (1) users will find
our speech-only interface to navigation efficient as
it allows them to navigate without having to re-
peatedly look at a map and (2), that users will
find a dialogue interface which integrates touris-
tic question-answering and navigation within a
shared context to be useful for finding information
about entities in the urban environment. We first
present some related work in section 2. We de-
scribe the architecture of the system in section 3.
We then present our experimental design, results
and analysis in sections 5, 6 and 7.

Mobile apps such as Siri, Google Maps Naviga-
tion, Sygic, etc. address the problem of naviga-
tion while apps like Triposo, Guidepal, Wikihood,
etc. address the problem of tourist information by
presenting the user with descriptive information
about various points of interest (PoI) in the city.
While some exploratory apps present snippets of
information about a precompiled list of PoIs, other
apps dynamically generate a list of PoIs arranged
based on their proximity to the users. Users can
also obtain specific information about PoIs using
Search apps. Also, since these navigation and ex-
ploratory/search apps do not address both prob-
lems in an integrated way, users need to switch
between them and therefore lose interaction con-
text.
While most apps address these two problems
independently, some like Google Now, Google
Field Trip, etc, mix navigation with exploration.
But such apps present information primarily vi-
sually on the screen for the user to read. Some
of these are available for download at the Google
Play Android app store1. Several dialogue and
natural language systems have addressed the issue

of pedestrian navigation (Malaka and Zipf, 2000;
Raubal and Winter, 2002; Dale et al., 2003; Bar-
tie and Mackaness, 2006; Shroder et al., 2011;
Dethlefs and Cuay´ahuitl, 2011). There has also
been recent interest in shared tasks for generat-
ing navigation instructions in indoor and urban en-
vironments (Byron et al., 2007; Janarthanam and
Lemon, 2011). Some dialogue systems deal with
presenting information concerning points of inter-
est (Ko et al., 2005; Kashioka et al., 2011) and in-
teractive question answering (Webb and Webber,
2009).
In contrast, Spacebook has the objective of
keeping the user’s cognitive load low and prevent-
ing users from being distracted (perhaps danger-
ously so) from walking in the city (Kray et al.,
2003). Also, it allows users to interleave the two
sub-tasks seamlessly and can keep entities dis-
cussed in both tasks in shared context (as shown
in Table 1).

The architecture of the Spacebook system is
shown in figure 1. Our architecture brings to-
gether Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), Geo-
graphic Information Systems (GIS) and Question-
Answering (QA) technologies (Janarthanam et al.,
2012). Its essentially a spoken dialogue system
(SDS) consisting of an automatic speech recog-
niser (ASR), a semantic parser, an Interaction
Manager, an utterance generator and a text-to-
speech synthesizer (TTS). The GIS modules in
this architecture are the City Model, the Visibility
Engine, and the Pedestrian tracker. Users commu-
nicate with the system using a smartphone-based
client app (an Android app) that sends users’ po-
sition, pace rate, and spoken utterances to the sys-
tem, and delivers synthesised system utterances to
the user.

3.1 Dialogue interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981020833333">
The dialogue interface consists of a speech recog-
nition module, an utterance parser, an interaction
manager, an utterance generator and a speech syn-
thesizer. The Nuance 9 speech recogniser with
a domain specific language model was used for
speech recognition. The recognised speech is cur-
rently parsed using a rule-based parser into dia-
logue acts and semantic content.
The Interaction Manager (IM) is the central
component of this architecture, which provides
the user with navigational instructions, pushes PoI
information and manages QA questions. It re-
ceives the user’s input in the form of a dialogue
act (DA), the user’s location (latitude and longi-
tude) and pace rate. Based on these inputs and the
dialogue context, it responds with system output
dialogue act, based on a dialogue policy. The IM
initiates the conversation with a calibration phase
where the user’s initial location and orientation are
obtained. The user can then initiate tasks that in-
terest him/her. These tasks include searching for
an entity (e.g. a museum or a restaurant), request-
ing navigation instructions to a destination, ask-
ing questions about the entities in the City Model,
and so on. When the user is mobile, the IM iden-
tifies points of interest2 on the route proximal to
the user. We call this “PoI push”. The user is en-
couraged to ask for more information if he/she is
interested. The system also answers adhoc ques-
tions from the user (e.g. “Who is David Hume?”,
“What is the Old College?”, etc) (see section 3.4).
Navigation instructions are given in-situ by ob-
serving user’s position continuously, in relation
to the next node (street junction) on the current
planned route, and they are given priority if in con-
flict with a PoI push at the same time. Navigation
instructions use landmarks near route nodes when-
ever possible (e.g. “When you reach Clydesdale
Bank, keep walking forward”). The IM also in-
forms when users pass by recognisable landmarks,
just to reassure them that they are on track (e.g.
“You will pass by Tesco on the right”). In addition
to navigation instructions, the IM also answers
users’ questions concerning the route, his/her lo-
cation, and location of and distance to the various
entities. Finally, the IM uses the city model’s Vis-
ibility Engine (VE) to determine whether the des-
tination is visible to the user (see section 3.3).

The shared spatial and dialogue context em-
ploys a feature-based representation which is up-
dated every 1 second (for location), and after every
dialogue turn. Spatial context such as the user’s
coordinates, street names, PoIs and landmarks
proximal to the user, etc are used by PoI push-
ing and navigation. The dialogue context main-
tains the history of landmarks and PoIs pushed,
latest entities mentioned, etc to resolve anaphoric
references in navigation and QA requests, and to
deliver coherent dialogue responses. The IM re-
solves anaphoric references by keeping a record
of entities mentioned in the dialogue context. It
also engages in clarification sub-dialogues when
the speech recognition confidence scores are low.
The IM stores the name and type information for
each entity (such as landmark, building, etc) men-
tioned in navigation instructions and PoI pushes.
Subsequent references to these entities using ex-
pressions such as “the museum”, “the cafe” etc
are resolved by searching for the latest entity of
the given type. Pronouns are resolved to the last
mentioned entity.
The IM also switches between navigation, PoI
push, and QA tasks in an intelligent manner by
using the shared context to prioritise its utterances
from these different tasks. The utterance genera-
tor is a Natural Language Generation module that
translates the system DA into surface text which is
converted into speech using the Cereproc Text-to-
Speech Synthesizer using a Scottish female voice.
The only changes made were minor adjustments
to the pronunciation of certain place names.

<bodyText confidence="0.999931090909091">
Urban environments can be challenging with lim-
ited sky views, and hence limited line of sight
to satellites, in deep urban corridors. There is
therefore significant uncertainty about the user’s
true location reported by GNSS sensors on smart-
phones (Zandbergen and Barbeau, 2011). This
module improves on the reported user position
by combining smartphone sensor data (e.g. ac-
celerometer) with map matching techniques, to
determine the most likely location of the pedes-
trian (Bartie and Mackaness, 2012).

ing resources such as Ordnance Survey, Open-

Scotland. It includes the location, use class, name,
street address, and where relevant other properties
such as build date and tourist ratings. The model
also includes a pedestrian network (streets, pave-
ments, tracks, steps, open spaces) which is used
by an embedded route planner to calculate min-
imal cost routes, such as the shortest path. The
city model also consists of a Visibility Engine
that identifies the entities that are in the user’s
vista space (Montello, 1993). To do this it ac-
cesses a digital surface model, sourced from Li-
DAR, which is a 2.5D representation of the city
including buildings, vegetation, and land surface
elevation. The Visibility Engine uses this dataset
to offer a number of services, such as determining
the line of sight from the observer to nominated
points (e.g. which junctions are visible), and de-
termining which entities within the city model are
visible. Using these services, the IM determines if
the destination is visible or not.

3.4 Question-Answering server
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999494472222222">
The QA server currently answers a range of def-
inition and biographical questions such as, “Tell
me more about the Scottish Parliament”, “Who
was David Hume?”, “What is haggis?”, and re-
quests to resume (eg. “Tell me more”). QA
is also capable of recognizing out of scope re-
quests, that is, either navigation-related questions
that can be answered by computations from the
City Model and dealt with elsewhere in the sys-
tem (“How far away is the Scottish Parliament?”,
“How do I get there?”), or exploration queries
that cannot be handled yet (“When is the can-
non gun fired from the castle?”). Question clas-
sification is entirely machine learning-based using
the SMO algorithm (Keerthi et al., 1999) trained
over 2013 annotated utterances. Once the question
has been typed, QA proceeds to focus detection
also using machine learning techniques (Mikhail-
sian et al., 2009). Detected foci include possi-
bly anaphoric expressions (“Who was he?”, “Tell
me more about the castle”). These expressions
are resolved against the dialogue history and ge-
ographical context. QA then proceeds to a tex-
tual search on texts from the Gazetteer of Scotland
(Gittings, 2012) and Wikipedia, and definitions
from WordNet glosses. The task is similar to TAC
KBP 2013 Entity Linking Track and named en-
tity disambiguation (Cucerzan, 2007). Candidate
answers are reranked using a trained confidence
score with the top candidate used as the final an-
swer. These are usually long, descriptive answers
and are provided as a flow of sentence chunks that
the user can interrupt (see table 2). The Interaction
Manager queries the QA model and pushes infor-
mation when a salient PoI is in the vicinity of the
user.

The baseline system chosen for evaluation was

to use the functionalities of device using a speech
interface. For example, the user can say “Call
John” and it will dial John from the user’s con-

users request directions and it activates Google

tions. The Navigation app is capable of providing
instructions in-situ using speech. We used the S-
Voice system for comparison because it provided
an integrated state-of-the-art interface to use both
a navigation app and also an information-seeking
app using the same speech interface. Users were
encouraged to use these apps using speech but
were allowed to use the GUI interface when us-
ing speech wasn’t working (e.g. misrecognition of
local names). Users obtained the same kind of in-

Spacebook and the baseline were evaluated in the
summer of 2012. We evaluated both systems with
17 subjects in the streets of Edinburgh. There
were 11 young subjects (between 20 and 26 years,
mean=22 ± 2) and 6 older subjects (between 50
and 71 years, mean=61 ± 11). They were mostly
native English speakers (88%). 59% of the users
were regular smartphone users and their mean
overall time spent in the city was 76 months. The
test subjects had no previous experience with the
proposed system. They were recruited via email
adverts and mail shots. Subjects were given a task
sheet with 8 tasks in two legs (4 tasks per leg).
These tasks included both navigation and tourist
information tasks (see table 3). Subjects used our
system for one of the legs and the baseline system
for the other and the order was balanced. Each leg
took up to 30 mins to finish and the total duration
including questionnaires was about 1.5 hours. Fig-
ure 2 shows the route taken by the subjects. The
route is about 1.3 miles long. Subjects were fol-
lowed by the evaluator who made notes on their
behaviour (e.g. subject looks confused, subject
looks at or manipulates the phone, subject looks
around, etc).
Subjects filled in a demographic questionnaire
prior to the experiment. After each leg, they filled
in a system questionnaire (see appendix) rating
their experience. After the end of the experi-
ment, they filled out a comparative questionnaire
and were debriefed. They were optionally asked
to elaborate on their questionnaire ratings. Users
were paid £20 after the experiment was over.

Subjects were also asked to choose between the
two systems given a number of requirements such
as ease of use, use for navigation, tourist infor-

the same requirements as the system questionnaire
with one additional question - “Overall which sys-
tem do you prefer?” (CQ0). Users’ choice of sys-
tem based on a variety of requirements is shown
in table 6. Users’ choice counts were tested us-
ing Chi-square test. Significant differences were
found in users’ choice of system for navigation
and tourist information requirements. Users pre-
ferred the baseline system for navigation (CQ2)
and our system for touristic information (CQ3) on
the city. Although there was a clear choice of sys-
tems based on the two tasks, there was no signifi-
cant preference of one system over the other over-
all (CQ0). They chose our system as the most in-
teresting system to interact with (CQ11) and that
it was more informative than the baseline (CQ12).

users noted that a visual map and the directional
arrow in the baseline system was helpful for nav-
igation. In addition, they noted that our system’s
navigation instructions were sometimes not satis-
factory. They observed that there weren’t enough
instructions coming from the system at street junc-
tions. They needed more confirmatory utterances
(that they are walking in the right direction) (5
users) and quicker recovery and notification when
walking the wrong way (5 users). They observed
that the use of street names was confusing some-
times. Some users also wanted a route summary
before the navigation instructions are given.
The problem with Spacebook’s navigation pol-
icy was that it did not, for example, direct the
user via easily visible landmarks (e.g. “Head to-
wards the Castle”), and relies too much on street
names. Also, due to the latency in receiving GPS
information, the IM sometimes did not present in-
structions soon enough during evaluation. Some-
times it received erroneous GPS information and
therefore got the user’s orientation wrong. These

(CQ are the same questions as SQ but requesting
a ranking of the 2 systems)
as KFC, Tesco, etc. (popular chain stores). Some
users also suggested that our system should have
a map and that routes taken should be plotted on
them for reference. Based on the ratings and ob-
servations made by the users, we conclude that our
first hypothesis that Spacebook would be more ef-
ficient for navigation than the baseline because of
its speech-only interface was inconclusive. We be-
lieve so because users’ poor ratings for Spacebook
may be due to the current choice of dialogue pol-
icy for navigation. It may be possible to reassure
the user with a better dialogue policy with just the
speech interface. However, this needs further in-
vestigation.
Users found the information-search task inter-
esting and informative when they used Spacebook
(see sample user comments in table 8). They
also found push information on nearby PoIs un-
expected and interesting as they would not have
found them otherwise. Many users believed that
this could be an interesting feature that could help
tourists. They also found that asking questions and
finding answers was much easier with Spacebook
compared to the baseline system, where some-
times users needed to type search keywords in.
Another user observation was that they did not
have to stop to listen to information presented
by our system (as it was in speech) and could
carry on walking. However, with the baseline sys-
tem, they had to stop to read information off the
screen. Although users in general liked the QA
feature, many complained that Spacebook spoke
too quickly when it was presenting answers. Some
users felt that the system might lose context of the
navigation task if presented with a PoI question.
In contrast, some others noted Spacebook’s ability
to interleave the two tasks and found it to be an
advantage.
Users’ enthusiasm for our system was observed
when (apart from the points of interest that were
in the experimental task list) they also asked spon-
taneous questions about James Watt, the Talbot
Rice gallery, the Scottish Parliament and Edin-
burgh Castle. Some of the PoIs that the system
pushed information about were the Royal College
of Surgeons, the Flodden Wall, the Museum of
Childhood, and the Scottish Storytelling Centre.
Our system answered a mean of 2.5 out of 6.55
questions asked by users in leg 1 and 4.88 out of
8.5 questions in leg 2. Please note that an utter-
ance is sent to QA if it is not parsed by the parser
and therefore some utterances may not be legit-
mate questions themselves. Users were pushed a
mean of 2.88 and 6.37 PoIs during legs 1 and 2.
There were a total of 17 “tell me more” requests
requesting the system to present more information
(mean=1.35 ± 1.57).
Evaluators who followed the subjects noted that
the subjects felt difficulty using the baseline sys-
tem as they sometimes struggled to see the screen

identifying which way to go based on the route
plotted on the map. In comparison, subjects did
not have to look at the screen when they used
our system. Based on the ratings and observa-
tions made by the users about our system’s tourist
information features such as answering questions
and pushing PoI information, we have support for
our second hypothesis: that users find a dialogue
interface which integrates question-answering and
navigation within a shared context to be useful for
finding information about entities in the urban en-
vironment.

8 Future plans
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958315789474">
We plan to extend Spacebook’s capabilities to ad-
dress other challenges in pedestrian navigation and
tourist information. Many studies have shown
that visible landmarks provide better cues for nav-
igation than street names (Ashweeni and Steed,
2006; Hiley et al., 2008). We will use visible
landmarks identified using the visibility engine to
make navigation instructions more effective, and
we plan to include entities in dialogue and visual
context as candidates for PoI push, and to imple-
ment an adaptive strategy that will estimate user
interests and push information that is of interest
to them. We are also taking advantage of user’s
local knowledge of the city to present navigation
instructions only for the part of the route that the
user does not have any knowledge of. These fea-
tures, we believe, will make users’ experience of
the interface more pleasant, useful and informa-
tive.

9 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999952">
We presented a mobile dialogue app called Space-
book to support pedestrian users in navigation
and tourist information gathering in urban envi-
ronments. The system is a speech-only interface
and addresses navigation and tourist information
in an integrated way, using a shared dialogue con-
text. For example, using the navigational context,
Spacebook can push point-of-interest information
which can then initiate touristic exploration tasks
using the QA module.
We evaluated the system against a state-of-the-
art baseline (Samsung S-Voice with Google Navi-
gation and Search) with a group of 17 users in the
streets of Edinburgh. We found that users found
Spacebook interesting to interact with, and that
it was their system of choice for touristic infor-
mation exploration tasks. These results were sta-
tistically significant. Based on observations and
user ratings, we conclude that our speech-only
system was less preferred for navigation and more
preferred for tourist information tasks due to fea-
tures such as PoI pushing and the integrated QA
module, when compared to the baseline system.
Younger users, who used Spacebook, even felt that
they learned new facts about the city.

In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</abstract>
