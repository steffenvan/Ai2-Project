My term came at the time of the New York
World Fair. The Association, still of MT as well
as CL, was trying to crash the club that shared
profits from the annual meetings of AFIPS. These
were producing something over $20,000, a sum which
in those days would do more than pay a fraction of
one&apos;s annual overhead on an NSF grant. ACM of
course was grabbing the bulk of this, but IEEE
wasn&apos;t doing badly, to judge by the magnificence
of its journal. I attended the pow-wows of the
powers national and international. In spite of
our run-down heels, they treated me courteously.
Among other activities we journeyed out for a
preview of the World Fair exhibits.
IBM&apos;s massive show, with a queition-answer
demonstration as its highlight, didn&apos;t absorb all
that much attention from a group, all of whom may
have shaken the hand of Seymour Cray and pondered
at his hilltop. Convention memories fade after so
long a time. I remember best a conversation from
a representative from Japan. He expressed great
wonder at all things and beings American. The
head of our computation center was a tall tennis-
buff. When I gave my new friend the name his
response was: &amp;quot;Oh the great ...?&amp;quot; I still haven&apos;t
reconciled the possible interpretations on his use
of the adjective.
A couple of the more prominent members of the
hardware crowd offered me a ride back to town
after our group had paid its respects to a few
more pavilions of the Fair. When we located their
car it turned out to be an old four-door Buick,
barely hanging together. The back seat was
clogged with computer parts, an overflow from the
trunk; I made a bit of room for myself among the
pirated splendors and listened to the hopeful
chatter on the wonders of the new world, hoping
both the Buick and the absorbed driver would
preserve me for it.
Thanks to a successful outcome of the ride no
doubt, I received issues of the elegant IEEE
journal for a few years. The Association did get
a cut out of the AFIPS pot, as I recall, but since
it was distributed in accordance with membership,
our 600 didn&apos;t stack up too well against the
20,000 of ACM.
The rest of my year was more routine.
