Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997513125">
In this paper, we present our system descrip-
tion in task of Cross-lingual Textual Entail-
ment. The goal of this task is to detect
entailment relations between two sentences
written in different languages. To accomplish
this goal, we first translate sentences written
in foreign languages into English. Then, we
use EDITS1, an open source package, to rec-
ognize entailment relations. Since EDITS only
draws monodirectional relations while the task
requires bidirectional prediction, thus we ex-
change the hypothesis and test to detect en-
tailment in another direction. Experimental
results show that our method achieves promis-
ing results but not perfect results compared to
other participants.

In Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task (CLTE)
of 2012, the organizers hold a task for Cross-
Lingual Textual Entailment. The Cross-Lingual
Textual Entailment task addresses textual entail-
ment (TE) recognition under a new dimension
(cross-linguality), and within a new challenging
application scenario (content synchronization)
Readers can refer to M. Negri et al. 2012.s., for
more detailed introduction. 1
Textual entailment, on the other hand, recog-
nize, generate, or extract pairs of natural language
expressions, and infer that if one element is true,
whether the other element is also true. Several
methods are proposed by previous researchers.
There have been some workshops on textual en-
tailment in recent years. The recognizing textual
entailment challenges (Bar-Haim et al. 2006;
Giampiccolo, Magnini, Dagan, &amp; Dolan, 2007;
Giampiccolo, Dang, Magnini, Dagan, &amp; Dolan,
2008), currently in the 7th year, provide additional
significant thrust. Consequently, there are a large
number of published articles, proposed methods,
and resources related to textual entailment. A spe-
cial issue on textual entailment was also recently
published, and its editorial provides a brief over-
view of textual entailment methods (Dagan, Dolan,
Magnini, &amp; Roth, 2009).
Textual entailment recognizers judge whether
or not two given language expressions constitute a
correct textual entailment pair. Different methods
may operate at different levels of representation of
the input expressions. For example, they may treat
the input expressions simply as surface strings,
they may operate on syntactic or semantic repre-
sentations of the input expressions, or on represen-
tations combining information from different

levels. Logic-based approach is to map the lan-
guage expressions to logical meaning representa-
tions, and then rely on logical entailment checks,
possibly by invoking theorem provers (Rinaldi et
al., 2003; Bos &amp; Markert, 2005; Tatu &amp; Moldovan,
2005, 2007). An alternative to use logical meaning
representations is to start by mapping each word of
the input language expressions to a vector that
shows how strongly the word co-occurs with par-
ticular other words in corpora (Lin, 1998b), possi-
bly also taking into account syntactic information,
for example requiring that the co-occurring words
participate in particular syntactic dependencies
(Pad´o &amp; Lapata, 2007). Several textual entailment
recognizing methods operate directly on the input
surface strings. For example, they compute the
string edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) of the two
input strings, the number of their common words,
or combinations of several string similarity
measures (Malakasiotis &amp; Androutsopoulos, 2007).
Dependency grammar parsers (Melcuk, 1987; Ku-
bler, McDonald, &amp; Nivre, 2009) are popular in
textual entailment research. However, cross-lingual
textual entailment brings some problems on past
algorithms. On the other hand, many methods can’t
be applied to it directly.
In this paper, we propose a translation based
method for cross-lingual textual entailment, which
has been described in Mehdad et al. 2010. First, we
translate one part of the text, which termed as “t1”
and written in one language, into English, which
termed as “t2”. Then, we use EDITS, an open
source package, to recognize entailment relations
between two parts. Large-scale experiments are
conducted on four language pairs, French-English,
Spanish-English, Italian-English and German-
English. Although our method achieves promising
results reported by organizers, it is still far from
perfect compared to other participants.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. We describe our system framework in
section 2. We report experimental results in section
3 and draw our conclusions in the last section.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall framework of our
system, where a machine translation model is em-
ployed to translate foreign language into English,
since original EDITS could only deal with the text
in the same language pairs.
In the following of this section, we will de-

EDITS in details.

2.1 Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998698826086956">
Recently, machine translation has attracted inten-
sive attention and has been well studied in natural
language community. Effective models, such as
Phrase-Based model (Koehn et al., 2003), Hierar-
chical Phrase-Based model (HPB) (Chiang, 2005),
and Syntax-Based (Liu et al., 2006) model have
been proposed to improve the translation quality.
However, since current translation models require
parallel corpus to extract translation rules, while
parallel corpus on some language pairs such as
Italian-English and Spanish-English are hard to
obtain, therefore, we could use Google Translation
Toolkit (GTT) to generate translation.
Specifically, WMT2 released some bilingual
corpus for training, thus we use some portion to
train a French-English translation engine using
hierarchical phrase-based model. We also exploit
system combination technique (A Rosti et al., 2007)
to improve translation quality via blending the
translation of our models and GTT’s. It is worth
noting that GTT only gives 1-best translation, thus
we duplicate 50 times to generate 50-best for sys-
tem combination.

2.2 Textual Entailment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99935844">
Many methods have been proposed to recognize
textual entailment relations between two expres-
sions written in the same language. Since edit dis-
tance algorithms are effective on this task, we
choose this method. And we use popular toolkit,
EDITS, to accomplish the textual entailment task.
EDITS is an open source software, which is
used for recognizing entailment relations between
two parts of text, termed as “T” and “H”. The sys-
tem is based on the edit distance algorithms, and
computes the “T”-“H” distance as the cost of the
edit operations (i.e. insertion, deletion and substitu-
tion) that are necessary to transform “T” into “H”.
EDITS requires that three modules are defined: an
edit distance algorithm, a cost scheme for the three
edit operations, and a set of rules expressing either
entailment or contradiction. Each module can be
easily configured by the user as well as the system
parameters. EDITS can work at different levels of
complexity, depending on the linguistic analysis
carried on over “T” and “H”. Both linguistic pro-
cessors and semantic resources that are available to
the user can be integrated within EDITS, resulting
in a flexible, modular and extensible approach to
textual entailment.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9835335">
Figure 2: An Example of two expressions
EDITS can recognize.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.97369275">
Figure 2 shows an example of two expressions
that EDITS can recognize. EDITS will give an an-
swer that whether expression “H” is true given that
expression “T” is true. The result is a Boolean val-
ue. If “H” is true given “T” is true, then the result
is “YES”, otherwise “NO”.
EDITS implements a distance-based frame-
work which assumes that the probability of an en-
tailment relation between a given “T”-“H” pair is
inversely proportional to the distance between “T”
and “H” (i.e. the higher the distance, the lower is
the probability of entailment). Within this frame-
work the system implements and harmonizes dif-
ferent approaches to distance computation,
providing both edit distance algorithms, and simi-
larity algorithms. Each algorithm returns a normal-
ized distance score (a number between 0 and 1). At
a training stage, distance scores calculated over
annotated “T”-“H” pairs are used to estimate a
threshold that best separates positive from negative
examples. The threshold, which is stored in a
Model, is used at a test stage to assign an entail-
ment judgment and a confidence score to each test
pair.

Figure 4 shows our training and decoding
procedure. As EDITS can only recognize textual
entailment from one part to the other, we manually
change the tag “H” with “T”, and generate the re-
sults again, and then compute two parts’ entailment
relations. For example, if “T”-“H” is “YES”, and
“H”-“T” is “NO”, then the entailment result be-
tween them is “forward”; if “T”-“H” is “NO”, and
“H”-“T” is “YES”, then the entailment result be-
tween them is “backward”; if both “T”-“H” and
“H”-“T” are “YES”, the result is “bidirectional”;

Since organizers of SemEval 2012 task 8 supply a

timize parameters for EDITS. Table 1 shows the F-
measure score of training set analyzed by EDITS,

resents Spanish-English, “IE” represents Italian-

From Table 1, we can see that the perfor-
mance of “forward” prediction is lower than others.
One explanation is that the “T” is translated from
foreign language, which is error unavoidable. Thus
some rules used for checking “T”, such as stop-
word list will be disabled. Then it is possible to
induce a “NO” relation between “T” and “H” that
results in lower recall of “forward”.
Since for French-English, we build a system
combination for improving the quality of transla-
tion. Table 2 shows the results of BLEU score of
translation quality, and F-score of entailment
judgment.

model, where COMB represents system com-
bination.
From table 2, we find that the translation qual-
ity slightly affect the correctness of entailment
judgment. However, the difference of performance
in entailment judgment is smaller than that in
translation quality. We explain that the translation
models exploit phrase-based rules to direct the
translation, and the translation errors mainly come
from the disorder between each phrases. While a
distance based entailment model generally consid-
ers the similarity of phrases between test and hy-
pothesis, thus the disorder of phrases influences the
judgment slightly.

rameters, table 3 to table 6 shows the detailed ex-

Results in table 7 and table 8 shows that mod-
els trained on “CLTE” have better performance
than those trained on RTE1 and RTE2, except “bi-
directional” judgment type. In Table 9, all results
decoding by models trained on “CLTE” are the
best. And in Table 10, only a few results decoding
by models trained on “RTE1” and “RTE2” have
higher score. The reason may be that, the test cor-
pora are bilingual, there are some errors in the ma-
chine translation procedure when translate one part
of the test from its language into the other. When
training on these bilingual text and decoding these
bilingual text, these two procedure have error con-
sistency. Some errors may be counteracted. If we
train on RTE, a standard monolingual text, and
decode a bilingual text, more errors may exist be-
tween the two procedures. So we believe that, if
we use translation based strategy (machine transla-
tion and monolingual textual entailment) to gener-
ate cross-lingual textual entailment, we should use
translation based strategy to train models, rather
than use standard monolingual texts.

The goal of this task is to detect entailment relations between two sentences written in different languages. To accomplish this goal, we first translate sentences written in foreign languages into English. Then, we an open source package, to recognize entailment relations. Since EDITS only draws monodirectional relations while the task requires bidirectional prediction, thus we exchange the hypothesis and test to detect entailment in another direction. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising results but not perfect results compared to other participants.</abstract>

In the following of this section, we will describe the translation module and configuration of EDITS in details. Figure 1: The framework of our system. 2.1 Machine Translation Recently, machine translation has attracted intensive attention and has been well studied in natural language community. Effective models, such as Phrase-Based model (Koehn et al., 2003), Hierarchical Phrase-Based model (HPB) (Chiang, 2005), and Syntax-Based (Liu et al., 2006) model have been proposed to improve the translation quality. However, since current translation models require parallel corpus to extract translation rules, while parallel corpus on some language pairs such as Italian-English and Spanish-English are hard to obtain, therefore, we could use Google Translation Toolkit (GTT) to generate translation. Specifically, WMT2 released some bilingual corpus for training, thus we use some portion to train a French-English translation engine using hierarchical phrase-based model.

Experimental results show that our method achieves promising results but not perfect results compared to other participants. 1 Introduction In Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task (CLTE) of 2012, the organizers hold a task for CrossLingual Textual Entailment. The Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task addresses textual entailment (TE) recognition under a new dimension (cross-linguality), and within a new challenging application scenario (content synchronization) Readers can refer to M. Negri et al. 2012.s., for more detailed introduction. 1 Textual entailment, on the other hand, recognize, generate, or extract pairs of natural language expressions, and infer that if one element is true, whether the other element is also true. Several methods are proposed by previous researchers. There have been some workshops on textual entailment in recent years. The recognizing textual entailment challenges (Bar-Haim et al. 2006; Giampiccolo, Magnini, Dagan, &amp; Dolan, 2007; Giampiccolo, Dang, Magnini, Dagan, &amp; Dolan, 2008), currently in the 7th year, provide additional significant thrust. Consequently, ther</context>

In the following of this section, we will describe the translation module and configuration of EDITS in details. Figure 1: The framework of our system. 2.1 Machine Translation Recently, machine translation has attracted intensive attention and has been well studied in natural language community. Effective models, such as Phrase-Based model (Koehn et al., 2003), Hierarchical Phrase-Based model (HPB) (Chiang, 2005), and Syntax-Based (Liu et al., 2006) model have been proposed to improve the translation quality. However, since current translation models require parallel corpus to extract translation rules, while parallel corpus on some language pairs such as Italian-English and Spanish-English are hard to obtain, therefore, we could use Google Translation Toolkit (GTT) to generate translation. Specifically, WMT2 released some bilingual corpus for training, thus we use some portion to train a French-English translation engine using hierarchical phrase-</context>
