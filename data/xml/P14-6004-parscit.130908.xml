<bodyText confidence="0.999977594594595">
Contextual disambiguation and grounding of
concepts and entities in natural language are es-
sential to progress in many natural language un-
derstanding tasks and fundamental to many ap-
plications. Wikification aims at automatically
identifying concept mentions in text and linking
them to referents in a knowledge base (KB) (e.g.,
Wikipedia). Consider the sentence, &amp;quot;The Times
report on Blumenthal (D) has the potential to
fundamentally reshape the contest in the Nutmeg
State.&amp;quot;. A Wikifier should identify the key enti-
ties and concepts and map them to an encyclope-
dic resource (e.g., “D” refers to Democratic Par-
ty, and “the Nutmeg State” refers to Connecticut.
Wikification benefits end-users and Natural
Language Processing (NLP) systems. Readers
can better comprehend Wikified documents as
information about related topics is readily acces-
sible. For systems, a Wikified document eluci-
dates concepts and entities by grounding them in
an encyclopedic resource or an ontology. Wikifi-
cation output has improved NLP down-stream
tasks, including coreference resolution, user in-
terest discovery , recommendation and search.
This task has received increased attention in
recent years from the NLP and Data Mining
communities, partly fostered by the U.S. NIST
Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Pop-
ulation (KBP) track, and several versions of it
has been studied. These include Wikifying all
concept mentions in a single text document;
Wikifying a cluster of co-referential named enti-
ty mentions that appear across documents (Entity
Linking), and Wikifying a whole document to a
single concept. Other works relate this task to
coreference resolution within and across docu-
ments and in the context of multiple text genres. 7

This tutorial will motivate Wikification as a
broad paradigm for cross-source linking for
knowledge enrichment. We will discuss multiple
dimensions of the task definition, present the
building blocks of a state-of-the-art Wikifier,
share key lessons learned from analysis of re-
sults, and discuss recently proposed ideas for
advancing work in this area in response to key
challenges. We will touch on new research areas
including interactive Wikification, social media,
and censorship. The tutorial will be useful for all
those with interests in cross-source information
extraction and linking, knowledge acquisition,
and the use of acquired knowledge in NLP. We
will provide a concise roadmap of recent per-
spectives and results, and point to some of our
available Wikification resources.
