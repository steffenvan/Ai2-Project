Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999962888888889">
We describe a computational framework
for a grammar architecture in which dif-
ferent linguistic domains such as morphol-
ogy, syntax, and semantics are treated not
as separate components but compositional
domains. The framework is based on
Combinatory Categorial Grammars and it
uses the morpheme as the basic building
block of the categorial lexicon.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999172222222222">
In this paper, we address the problem of mod-
elling interactions between different levels of lan-
guage analysis. In agglutinative languages, affixes
are attached to stems to form a word that may cor-
respond to an entire phrase in a language like En-
glish. For instance, in Turkish, word formation is
based on suffixation of derivational and inflectional
morphemes. Phrases may be formed in a similar
way (1).

In Turkish, there is a significant amount of in-
teraction between morphology and syntax. For in-
stance, causative suffixes change the valence of the
verb, and the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb
for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case.
Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modi-
fies may be not its stem but a compound head cross-
ing over the word boundaries, e.g.,

(2) iyi oku-mu§ cocuk
well read-REL child
&apos;well-educated child&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999688105263158">
In (2), the relative suffix -mw (in past form of
subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give the
scope [[[iyi okulmuq] cocukl If syntactic composi-
tion is performed after morphological composition,
we would get compositions such as [iyi [okurnu§
gocuk]J or ffiyi okumu§1 cocuk] which yield ill-formed
semantics for this utterance.
As pointed out by Oehrle (1988), there is no rea-
son to assume a layered grammatical architecture
which has linguistic division of labor into compo-
nents acting on one domain at a time. As a computa-
tional framework, rather than treating morphology,
syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we pro-
pose an integrated model to capture the high level of
interaction between the three domains. The model,
which is based on Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mars (CCG) (Ades and Steedman, 1982; Steedman,
1985), uses the morpheme as the building block of
composition at all three linguistic domains.

When the morpheme is given the same status as
the lexeme in terms of its lexical, syntactic, and
semantic contribution, the distinction between the
process models of morphotactics and syntax disap-
pears. Consider the example in (3).

Two different compositions&apos; in CCG formalism
are given in Figure 1. Both interpretations are plau-
sible, with (la) being the most likely in the absence
of a long pause after the first adjective. To account
for both cases, the suffix -/u must be allowed to mod-
ify the head it is attached to (e.g., lb in Figure 1),
or a compound head encompassing the word bound-
aries (e.g., 11 in Figure 1).

In order to perform morphological and syntactic
compositions in a unified framework, the slash oper-
ators of Categorial Grammar must be enriched with
the knowledge about the type of process and the
type of morpheme. We adopt a representation sim-
ilar to Hoeksema and Janda&apos;s (1988) notation for
the operator. The 3-tuple &lt;direction, morpheme
type, process type&gt; indicates direction2 (left, right,
unspecified), morpheme type (free, bound), and
the type of morphological or syntactic attachment
(e.g., affix, clitic, syntactic concatenation, reduplica-
tion). Examples of different operator combinations
are given in Figure 2.

ments are of the following f (function) sign:
res-op-arg is the categorial notation for the ele-
ment. phon represents the phonological string. Lex-
ical elements may have (a) phonemes, (b) meta-
phonemes such as H for high vowel, and D for a dental
whose voicing is not yet determined, and (c) optional
segments, e.g., -(01A, to model vowel/consonant
drops, in the phon feature. During composition,
the surface forms of composed elements are mapped
and saved in phon. phon also allows efficient lexicon
search. For instance, the causative suffix -DHr has
eight different realizations but only one lexical entry.
Every res and arg feature has an f or p (property)
sign:

sign) and semantic (s sign) properties, respectively.

A special feature value called none is used for
imposing certain morphotactic constraints, and to
make sure that the stem is not inflected with the
same feature more than once. It also ensures,
through syn constraints, that inflections are marked
in the right order (cf., Figure 3).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996575">
Turkish is a language in which grammatical func-
tions can be marked morphologically (e.g., case),
or syntactically (e.g., indirect objects). Semantic
composition is also affected by the interplay of mor-
phology and syntax, for instance the change in the
scope of modifiers and genitive suffixes, or valency
and thematic role change in causatives. To model
interactions between domains, we propose a catego-
rial approach in which composition in all domains
proceed in parallel. As an implementation, we have
been working on the modelling of Turkish causatives
using this framework.
