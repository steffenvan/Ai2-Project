INTRODUCTION

Although funding for Machine Translation (MT) research
virtually ended in the U.S. with the release of the
ALPAC report [1] in 1966, there has been a continuing
interest in this field. Rapid evolution of science and
technology, coupled with increased world-wide exposure
of their products, demands more and more speed in trans-
lation (e.g., in the case of operation and maintenance
manuals). Unfortunately, this rapid evolution has made
translation an even more difficult and time-consuming
task. The large surplus of (presumably qualified)
translators cited by the ALPAC report simply does not
exist in many technical areas; the current state of
affairs finds instead a critical shortage. In addition,
the proportion of scientific and technical literature •
published in English is diminishing. As qualified human
translators become more scarce and costs of human trans-
lation rise while costs of purchase and operation of
powerful computer systems fall, there must come a time
when, if MT is feasible at all, it will be cost-effec-
tive. It is appropriate, then, to investigate the
state-of-the-art in MT with respect to two central ques-
tions: is high-quality MT feasible (and in what sense);
and if feasible, is it cost-effective?
This paper reports the results of an experiment in
highly automatic, high-quality machine translation. The
LRC&apos;s MT system, METAL (for Mechanical Translation and
Analysis of Languages), is an advanced, &apos;third genera-
tion system incorporating proven Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) techniques, both syntactic and semantic,
and stands at the forefront of the MT research frontier.
In the experiment, METAL was employed in the translation
of a 50-page text from German into English in order to
determine whether the system as it exists can be effec-
tively applied to current translation needs, effective-
ness to be determined by some objective measure of the
quality and cost of machine (i.e., METAL) vs. human
translation.
EARLIER MT EFFORTS
Since Bruderer [2] has recently published a complete
survey of MT projects, and Hutchins [3] reviews the
most important developments through 1977, we will men-
tion only a few of the major efforts. The first popular
demonstration of the possibilities in MT was provided by
IBM and the Georgetown University group in 1954 [4].
With a vocabulary of about 250 words and a grammar com-
prising some six rules in what was called an &amp;quot;operation-
al syntax&amp;quot;, the system demonstrated some rudimentary
capability in Russian to English translation. This in-
stigated a massive government funding effort over the
next decade, and some 20 million dollars was invested in
17 different projects. By 1965 the Mark II Russian-
English system [5] had been installed at the Foreign
Technology Division of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-
Patterson AFB, and the Georgetown system had been deli-
vered to the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory and to EURATOM in Ispra, Italy. Re-
viewing MT systems such as these at the request of the
National Science Foundation, the Automatic Language Pro-
cessing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) reported in 1966 that
MT was slower, less accurate, and more expensive than
human translation; further, that there was no predicta-
ble prospect of improvement in MT capability. Though
strongly and perhaps justifiably criticized (6], this
report soon resulted in the virtual elimination of MT
funding in the U.S., and a sizeable reduction in foreign
efforts as well.
Peter Tome, who was responsible for the installations at
Oak Ridge and Ispra cited above, soon began private ef-
forts at improving the Georgetown system. This culmina-
ted in SYSTRAN [7], which replaced Mark II at WPAFB in
1970 and the Georgetown system at EURATOM in 1976.
SYSTRAN was also used by NASA during the Apollo-Soyuz
mission. In 1976 the Commission of European Communities
adopted SYSTRAN for English to French translation; how-
ever, an evaluation of its translations by the EEC post-
editors in Brussels found the results to be far from sat-
isfactory: all the revisors had exhausted their patience
before the end&amp;quot; [8]. Despite its generally low transla-
tion quality, SYSTRAN is the most widely used MT system
to date. Its chief commercial competitor, LOGOS [9], is
another example of a &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; MT system. As in SYSTRAN,
the analysis and synthesis components are separated but
the linguistic procedures are designed for a specific
source-language (SL) and target-language (TL) pair. In
an evaluation by Sinaiko and Klare (10], LOGOS did not
fare well. Bruderer [2] reports further development for
translation into Russian, and experiments on French, Ger-
man and Spanish, but provides few details.
In an effort to correct the obvious inadequacies of
these and other &apos;first generation&apos; systems, which essen-
tially translate word-for-word with no attempt at a uni-
fied analysis at the sentence level, and which were de-
veloped ab initio for a specific SL-TL pair, researchers
began to investigate methods of analyzing sentences into
structures from which in theory any TL could be genera-
ted. There are two broad types of such &apos;second genera-
tion&apos; systems. One type produces analyses in a &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot;
structure, or &apos;interlingua&apos;; the other produces SL syn-
tactic structures which are transformed via a process
called &apos;transfer&apos; into a syntactic structure for the IL
sentence. One example of the former approach is the
system produced by the Centre d&apos;gtudes pour Is Traduc-
tion Automatique (CETA) at the University of Grenoble
[11]. During the period from 1961 to 1971 this group
developed a Russian to French MT system. An evaluation
at the end of that period revealed that only 42% of the
sentences were being correctly translated. Some fail-
ures were due to errors in the input, but the majority
were due to programming errors, failure to produce a
lexical analysis of a word or a syntactic analysis of a
sentence, inefficiencies in the parser causing it to ap-
ply too many rules, etc. The Traduction Automatique de
l&apos;Universit6 de Montr6a1 (TAUM) project [12] is an exam-
ple of the transfer approach. There are five grammars
called &amp;quot;Q-systems&amp;quot; to effect morphological and syntactic
analysis of English, then transfer, then syntactic and
morphological synthesis of French. Each such stage con-
sists of a series of generalized tree-structure transfor
mations. The significance of TAUM is that, of the sec-
ond-generation systems, it is the nearest to operational
implementation: it is to be applied to the translation
of aircraft maintenance manuals.
In 1978 the European project EUROTRA was initiated, ap-
parently adopting the newer Grenoble system ARIANE, in
order to produce an advanced, second generation MT sys-
tem for the eventual replacement of the first genera-
tion system (SYSTRAN) currently,in use [8]. The Greno-
ble group, now titled Groupe d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduc-
tion Automatique (GETA), abando ed their earlier ap-
proach in light of its deficiencies and produced a sys-
tem to translate in six passes: morphological analysis,
multi-level (syntactic and semantic) analysis, lexical
transfer, structural transfer, syntactic generation,and
morphological generation. Multi-level analysis, struc-
tural transfer, and syntactic generation are all effec-
ted N..a a general tree-to-tree transducer program, some-

what less powerful hoc perhaps more efficient tnan the Q-
systems transduce, in TAUM; the other components have spe-
cial orograms suited to their function. The emphasis in
this project is apparently twofold: increased efficiency
and reliability through adoption of components with the
minimum necessary power, and decreased sensitivity to
failure in individual stages through the expedient of in-
suring that every component has some output, even if
such output is nothing more than the original input. If
we have interpreted the Vauquois mimeo [8] properly, this
must be the largest and most comprehensive MT project yet
undertaken.

DESCRIPTION OF METAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999624327868853">
There are two different classifications of &amp;quot;generations&amp;quot;
in MT systems. The first posits three generations (cur-
rently) according to the following criteria: (1) trans-
lation is word-for-word, with no significant syntactic
analysis; (2) translation proceeds after obtaining a
complete syntactic analysis of an input, with no signifi-
cant semantic analysis; (3) translation proceeds after
obtaining a complete semantic analysis of an input. The
definition of &apos;third generation says nothing about ex-
tra-sentential information, and one might posit a
&apos;fourth generation&apos; which employs such information. The
other classification proceeds according to the following
criteria: (1) translation proceeds &amp;quot;directly&amp;quot; from the
SL to the TL, and the SL is analyzed only to the minimum
extent necessary to generate TL equivalents; (2) trans-
lation proceeds &amp;quot;indirectly&amp;quot; by deriving a more-or-less
standard analysis of the input, independent of the TL in-
volved (but not necessarily of the SL), and then genera-
ting TL output based on the standard analysis. Within
this definition of &apos;second generation&apos;, as noted above,
there are the &apos;transfer&apos; vs. &apos;interlingua&apos; approaches.
We prefer to characterize METAL as a &apos;third generation&apos;
system according to the first classification given above
because this makes it clear that METAL derives a sub-
stantial semantic analysis, whereas the second definition
of &apos;second generation&apos; does not necessarily imply that
semantic analysis of any kind is performed.
METAL comprises two distinct components: the linguistic
and the computational. The linguistic component con-
sists of lexicons, phrase-structure grammar rules, case
frames and transformations. SL and TL lexical entries
include feature-value pairs encoding syntactic and sem-
antic information such as grammatical category, inflec-
tional class, semantic type, and case information (see
Figure 1). Transfer lexical entries indicate how and
under what conditions words or idioms in one language
translate into words or idioms in another (see Figure
2). The phrase-structure rules may be augmented with
procedures to determine their application via feature/
value tests, to add or copy features and values in the
interpretation being constructed, to invoke case-frame
routines, and to invoke specific or general transforma-
tions. Case-frame routines determine semantic case re-
lationships between verbs and nouns on the basis of syn-
tactic and semantic features, and produce their output
in the form of propositional trees. Transformatio.- are
pattern-pairs that specify old and new tree structures;
when invoked, a transformation attempts to match its
&amp;quot;old&amp;quot; side against the current structural descriptor,
and if successful converts it into one matching its
&amp;quot;new&amp;quot; side. In the process, features and values may be
tested and set arbitrarily. This provides the grammar.
with virtually unlimiteo -ontext sensitivity, but since
no interpretation can affect the operation of the parser
it still enjoys the advantages of context-free opera-
tion. Finally, there is a method for scoring, or rating,
interpretations; this allows the system to determine the
&amp;quot;best&amp;quot; interpretation for translation, and also provides
another mechanism for rejecting the application of any
rule, viz, a score below cutoff. Figure 3 illustrates a
typical grammar rule.
