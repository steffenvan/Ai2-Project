Automatic evaluation of translation qual-
ity has proved to be useful when the target
language is English. In this paper the eval-
uation of translation into Japanese is stud-
ied. An existing method based on n-gram
similarity between translations and refer-
ence sentences is difficult to apply to the
evaluation of Japanese because of the ag-
glutinativeness and variation of semanti-
cally similar expressions in Japanese. The
proposed method applies a set of para-
phrasing rules to the reference sentences
in order to increase the similarity score
for the expressions that differ only in their
writing styles. Experimental results show
the paraphrasing rules improved the cor-
relation between automatic evaluation and
human evaluation from 0.80 to 0.93.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999950373333333">
Evaluating natural language processing applica-
tions’ output is important both for users and devel-
opers. Tasks such as sentential parsing, morpho-
logical analysis and named entity recognition are
easy to evaluate automatically because the “right an-
swer” can be defined deterministically under a spe-
cific grammar or assumed criterion.
The evaluation of machine translation is not so
straightforward since there are infinite ways to out-
put similar meanings and one can not enumerate the
right answers exhaustively. In spite of that, auto-
matic translation evaluation is practically important
because the evaluation is laborious work for humans
and evaluation by humans tends to be arbitrary. Au-
tomatic evaluation is more reliable than human eval-
uation because of its consistency for the same trans-
lations.
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002b) is one of the meth-
ods for automatic evaluation of translation quality.
It uses the ratio of co-occurring n-grams between
a translation and single or multiple reference sen-
tences. High correlation is reported between the
BLEU score and human evaluations for translations
from Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish to En-
glish (Papineni et al., 2002a).
This paper investigates how to apply BLEU to the
evaluation of English-to-Japanese translation. The
main goal of this paper is to design a reliable method
of evaluation for translations from another language
to Japanese (henceforth we call this Japanese trans-
lation evaluation). There are some difficulties in ad-
justing BLEU for Japanese: BLEU uses n-grams of
words, so words in a sentence are assumed to be sep-
arated by spaces, while Japanese does not use spaces
between words. Moreover, Japanese has more vari-
ation in writing styles than English. A major differ-
ence in these languages is that Japanese has polite
forms expressed by inflections or auxiliary verbs. If
the style of the translations is not the same as that
of the reference sentences, the evaluation score be-
comes low even though the translations are accurate
in their meanings and grammar. To solve these prob-
lems, we apply paraphrasing rules to the reference
sentences so that the differences in writing styles do
not affect the evaluation score.
Another goal is derived from this application
of paraphrasing: to define a “good paraphrase”.
Here paraphrasing means rewriting sentences with-
out changing their semantics. Several methods of
paraphrasing have been studied. Some of them aim
at the preprocessing of machine translation (Mita-
mura and Nyberg, 2001; Takahashi et al., 2001).
They use paraphrasing to transform the input sen-
tences so that the language-transferring routines
can handle them easily. Another application of
paraphrasing is to canonicalize many expressions
that have the same semantics, supporting informa-
tion retrieval or question answering (Zukerman and
Raskutti, 2002; Torisawa, 2002). Paraphrasing tech-
niques in these studies are considered to be useful,
but they are difficult to evaluate.
Machine translation evaluation requires methods
to judge whether two sentences have the same
meaning even when they are syntactically different.
Therefore if a set of paraphrasing rules contributes
to more reliable translation evaluation, it can be said
to be “good” paraphrasing. Thus the study in this
paper also presents a new paradigm for evaluating
paraphrases.
Section 2 overviews the BLEU metric. Section 3
presents the proposed method of Japanese transla-
tion evaluation, and its performance is evaluated in
Section 4. Based on the experimental results, Sec-
tion 5 discusses qualitative and quantitative features
of paraphrasing.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99817825">
This section briefly describes the original BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002b)1, which was designed for
English translation evaluation, so English sentences
are used as examples in this section.

<bodyText confidence="0.960452666666666">
BLEU evaluation uses a parallel corpus which con-
sists of sentences in the source language and their
translations to the target language by professional
translators. We call the professional translations ref-
erence sentences. It is preferable if the corpus has
multiple reference sentences translated by multiple
translators for each source sentence.
Sentences in the source language are also trans-
lated by the translation systems to be evaluated. The

is an example.

Reference 1
I had my watch repaired by an office worker.
Reference 2

Candidate 1
I had a man in the office repair a watch.
Candidate 2

<bodyText confidence="0.9603475">
I had the person of an office correct a clock.
The BLEU score is based on n-gram precision
shown in Equation (1). It is the ratio of n-grams
which appear both in the candidate sentence and in
at least one of the reference sentences, among all n-
grams in the candidate sentence.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.94248975">

C : count in the candidate sentence
Cr : count in a corresponding reference sentence
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996163125">
Candidate 1 in Example 1 contains 11 unigrams
including punctuation. 8 unigrams out of these also
appear in Reference 1 or Reference 2: ‘I’, ‘had’, ‘a’,
‘in’, ‘the’, ‘office’, ‘watch’ and ‘.’, therefore, the un-
igram precision of Candidate 1 is 8/11. The bigram
precision is 4/10 since ‘I had’, ‘in the’, ‘the office’
and ‘watch .’ are found. The only matched trigram
is ‘in the office’, so the trigram precision is 1/9.
On the other hand, the unigram, bigram, and tri-
gram precisions of Candidate 2 are 8/11, 2/10, 0/9,
respectively, which are lower than those of Candi-
date 1. Indeed Candidate 1 is a better English trans-
lation than Candidate 2.
In practice the n-gram precision is calculated not
for each sentence but for all of the sentences in the
corpus.

2.2 Brevity Penalty

candidate sentence which consists only of frequently
used words can score a high n-gram precision. For
example, if the candidate sentence is just “The”, its
unigram precision is 1.0 if one of reference sen-
tences contains at least one ‘the’, and that is usually
true.
To penalize such a meaningless translation, the
BLEU score is multiplied by the brevity penalty
shown in (2).

2.3 BLEU score
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986166666667">
The BLEU score is calculated by Equation (3) be-
low. It is the geometric average of the n-gram pre-
cisions multiplied by the brevity penalty. The geo-
metric average is used because pn decreases expo-
nentially as n increases. The BLEU score ranges
between 0 and 1.

The evaluations use unigrams up to N-grams. If a
large n is used, the fluency of the sentences becomes
a more important factor than the correctness of the
words. Empirically the BLEU score has a high cor-
relation with human evaluation when N = 4 for En-
glish translation evaluations (Papineni et al., 2002b).

This section describes how to adapt BLEU for
Japanese translation evaluation. The adaptation con-
sists of three steps.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998864">
3.1 Use of Morphological Analyzer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.894605666666667">
The first modification is mandatory for using the n-
gram metric as in the original BLEU implementa-
tion. Since Japanese has no spaces between words,
the words have to be separated by morphological
analysis as in Example 2.
Example 2
Kare ga hon wo yo mi mashi ta .
He SUBJ book ACC read INF POLITE PAST .
‘He read a book.’
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972994">
3.2 Distinguish between Different
Parts-of-speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963227272727">
Many English words can be used as various parts-
of-speech (POSs), but BLEU doesn’t distinguish be-
tween the words with the same surface form in terms
of their POSs, since the sentences are not processed
by a tagger, so the system can’t handle POSs. This
doesn’t cause a problem because most of the multi-
POS words have conceptually similar meanings, as
exemplified by the adverb ‘fast’ and the adjective
‘fast’ which have the same basic concept, so match-
ing them between the candidate and references rea-
sonably reflects the quality of the translation.
On the other hand, Japanese homonyms tend to
be completely different if their POSs are different.
For example, the postpositional phrasal particle ‘ga’
and the connective particle ‘ga’ should be distin-
guished from one another since the former acts as
a subject case marker, while the latter connects two
clauses that normally contradict each other. Fortu-
nately the morphological analyzer outputs POS in-
formation when the sentence is separated into words,
and therefore the words are also distinguished by
their POSs in the described method.

Example 3 is another possible translation of the
source sentence of Example 2.
Example 3

‘He read a book.’
The only difference here is the ending of the sen-
tence has a less polite form. However, when Ex-
ample 2 is the only reference sentence, the BLEU
evaluation of Example 3 does not score high: 6/8 for
unigrams, 4/7 for bigrams, 3/6 for trigrams, and 2/5

for 4-grams, while its meaning is same as that of the
reference sentence.
Basically BLEU copes with this problem of varia-
tion in writing styles by relying on the number of ref-
erence sentences available for each source sentence
and by reflecting the total size of corpus. That is,
if the corpus has multiple reference sentences trans-
lated by different translators, multiple writing styles
will tend to be included, and if the corpus is very
large, such inconsistencies of writing style are sta-
tistically not a problem.
In Japanese translation evaluation, however, this
problem can not be resolved using such a quantita-
tive solution because the influence of the differences
in writing styles are too large. For example, whether
or not the translation is given in the polite form de-
pends on the translation system2, so the evaluation
score is strongly affected by the degree of matching
of the writing styles between the translation system
and the reference sentences.
To cancel out the differences in writing styles,
we apply some paraphrasing rules to the reference
sentences to generate new sentences with different
writing styles. The generated sentences are added
to the reference sentences, and therefore, n-grams
in the candidate sentences can match the reference
sentences regardless of their writing styles. Table 1
shows examples of paraphrasing rules.
These rules are applied to the reference sentences.
If a reference sentence matches to a paraphrasing
rule, the sentence is replicated and the replica is
rewritten using the matched rule. For example, the
Japanese sentence in Example 2 matches Rule 1 in
Table 1 so the Japanese sentence in Example 3 is

produced. In this case, the evaluation is done as if
there are two reference sentences, therefore, a can-
didate sentence gets the same score regardless of its
politeness.
To avoid applying the same rules repeatably, the
rules are applied in a specific order. How to generate
the rules is described in Section 4.1.

To see how much the three extensions above con-
tribute to the evaluation of translation, the correla-
tion between the automatic evaluation and the hu-
man evaluation is calculated. We used a bilingual
corpus which consists of 6,871 English sentences
on a technical domain and their translations into
Japanese.
100 sentences were randomly selected and trans-
lated by 5 machine translation systems S1-S5 and
a human H1 who is a native Japanese speaker but
does not have strong knowledge of the technical do-
main. These 6 translations were evaluated by five
methods: B1 to B4 are Japanese versions of BLEU
with the extension described in Section 3 and M1 is
a manual evaluation.
B1: Morphological analysis is applied to translated
Japanese sentences. Only the technique de-
scribed in Section 3.1 is used.
B2: Functional words are distinguished by their
POSs. This corresponds to the technique in
Section 3.1 and 3.2.
B3: Paraphrasing rules are applied to the reference
sentences as described in Section 3.3. Here
the applied rules are limited to 51 rules which
rewrite polite forms (e.g. 1 and 2 in Table 1).
B4: All 88 paraphrasing rules including other types
(e.g. 3 and 4 in Table 1) are applied.
M1: Average score of the manual evaluation of all
translations in the corpus. The sentences were
scored using a 5-level evaluation: 1 (poor) to
5 (good). The evaluator was different from the
translator of H1.

The paraphrasing rules used in B3 and B4 were
prepared manually by comparing the candidate sen-
tences and the reference sentences in the reminder of
the corpus which are not used for the evaluation. The
application of the rules are unlikely to produce in-
correct sentences, because the rules are adjusted by
adding the applicable conditions, and the rules that
may have side effects are not adopted. This was con-
firmed by applying the rules to 200 sentences in an-
other corpus. A total of 189 out of the 200 sentences
were paraphrased in at least a part, and all of the
newly created sentences were grammatically correct
and had the same meaning as the original sentences.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999229117647059">
Table 2 shows the result of evaluation using the five
methods. Comparing the correlation with M1, B2
slightly outperformed B1, thus the POS information
improves the evaluation. B3 was better than B2 in
correlation by 0.06. This is because the scores by the
B3 evaluation were much higher than the B2 evalu-
ation except for S5, since only S5 tends to output
sentences in polite form while the most of reference
sentences are written in polite form. Further im-
provement was observed in B4, by applying other
types of paraphrasing rules.
Figure 1 graphically illustrates the correlation be-
tween the BLEU evaluations and the human evalua-
tions, by normalizing the results so that S1 is 0, H1
is 1, and the rest of scores are linearly interpolated.
We can see that only B4 ranks all six systems in the
same order as the manual evaluation.

5.1 Lexical or Structural Paraphrasing Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955914363636364">
The paraphrasing rules used here have no lexical
rules that rewrite content words into other expres-
sions as in Example 4.
Example 4
dokusho : suru ↔ hon : wo : yo : mu
‘read’ ‘read a book’
The main reason why we don’t use such rules is
that this type of rules may produce incorrect sen-
tences. For instance, (a) in Example 5 is rewritten
into (b) by the rule in Example 4, but (b) is not cor-
rect.

This error can be decreased if the paraphrasing
rules have more strict conditions about surrounding
words, however, using such lexical rules contradicts
the original BLEU’s strategy that the differences in
expressions should be covered by the number of ref-

cause complicated rules tend to make the evaluation
arbitrary, that is, the evaluation score strongly de-
pends on the lexical rules. To verify that the lex-
ical rules are unnecessary, we added 17,478 word-

This result implies the differences in content
words do not affect the evaluations. More specifi-

in content words occur with almost equal probabil-
ity for each translation system. Thus it is enough
to use the structural (i.e. non-lexical) paraphrasing
rules which rewrite only functional words.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979166666667">
This paper has proposed an automatic translation
evaluation method applicable to Japanese translation
evaluation. The paraphrasing rules that cancel out
the differences in writing styles contributed to im-
prove the reliability of the automatic evaluation. The
proposed evaluation method with paraphrasing rules
achieved a high correlation of 0.93 with the human
evaluation, while the correlation was 0.80 without
the rules.
The experiments clarified how much the para-
phrasing rules improved the evaluation by compar-
ing the correlations. This means our system can
evaluate not only the translation quality but also
the paraphrasing rules under the assumption that the
more properly the semantically similar sentences are
judged as close sentences the more reliable the trans-
lation evaluation is. Therefore the translation evalu-
ation gives us an objective evaluation method of the
paraphrasing quality that has been difficult to evalu-
ate.
This paper focuses on non-lexical paraphrasing
since lexical paraphrasing rules make the translation
evaluation inconsistent, but if an exhaustive and pre-
cise set of paraphrasing rules can be generated, it
will be useful for translation evaluation, and its ap-
propriateness should be shown by the reliability of
the translation evaluation. In order to develop such
desirable paraphrasing rules, the automatic acquisi-
tion of paraphrasing rules will be our next research
direction.

An existing method based on n-gram similarity between translations and reference sentences is difficult to apply to the evaluation of Japanese because of the agglutinativeness and variation of semantically similar expressions in Japanese. The proposed method applies a set of paraphrasing rules to the reference sentences in order to increase the similarity score for the expressions that differ only in their writing styles. Experimental results show the paraphrasing rules improved the correlation between automatic evaluation and human evaluation from 0.80 to 0.93.</abstract>

To solve these problems, we apply paraphrasing rules to the reference sentences so that the differences in writing styles do not affect the evaluation score. Another goal is derived from this application of paraphrasing: to define a “good paraphrase”. Here paraphrasing means rewriting sentences without changing their semantics. Several methods of paraphrasing have been studied. Some of them aim at the preprocessing of machine translation (Mitamura and Nyberg, 2001; Takahashi et al., 2001). They use paraphrasing to transform the input sentences so that the language-transferring routines can handle them easily. Another application of paraphrasing is to canonicalize many expressions that have the same semantics, supporting information retrieval or question answering (Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002; Torisawa, 2002). Paraphrasing techniques in these studies are considered to be useful, but they are difficult to evaluate.

The evaluation of machine translation is not so straightforward since there are infinite ways to output similar meanings and one can not enumerate the right answers exhaustively. In spite of that, automatic translation evaluation is practically important because the evaluation is laborious work for humans and evaluation by humans tends to be arbitrary. Automatic evaluation is more reliable than human evaluation because of its consistency for the same translations. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002b) is one of the methods for automatic evaluation of translation quality. It uses the ratio of co-occurring n-grams between a translation and single or multiple reference sentences. High correlation is reported between the BLEU score and human evaluations for translations from Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish to English (Papineni et al., 2002a). This paper investigates how to apply BLEU to the evaluation of English-to-Japanese translation.

Section 3 presents the proposed method of Japanese translation evaluation, and its performance is evaluated in Section 4.

We call the professional translations reference sentences. It is preferable if the corpus has multiple reference sentences translated by multiple translators for each source sentence. Sentences in the source language are also translated by the translation systems to be evaluated. The 1See the c</context>

It is the geometric average of the n-gram precisions multiplied by the brevity penalty. The geometric average is used because pn decreases exponentially as n increases. The BLEU score ranges between 0 and 1. N 1 BLEU = BP · 11 pn I (n=1 / The evaluations use unigrams up to N-grams. If a large n is used, the fluency of the sentences becomes a more important factor than the correctness of the words. Empirically the BLEU score has a high correlation with human evaluation when N = 4 for English translation evaluations (Papineni et al., 2002b). 3 Japanese Version of BLEU and Its Extension This section describes how to adapt BLEU for Japanese translation evaluation. The adaptation consists of three steps. 3.1 Use of Morphological Analyzer The first modification is mandatory for using the ngram metric as in the original BLEU implementation. Since Japanese has no spaces between words, the words have to be separated by morphological analysis as in Example 2. Example 2 Kare ga hon wo yo mi mashi ta .
