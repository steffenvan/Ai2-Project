Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999968045454545">
The purpose of this study is to get a
working definition that matches people’s
intuitive notion of gossip and is suffi-
ciently precise for computational imple-
mentation. We conducted two experi-
ments investigating what type of conver-
sations people intuitively understand and
interpret as gossip, and whether they
could identify three proposed constitu-
ents of gossip conversations: third per-
son focus, pejorative evaluation and sub-
stantiating behavior. The results show
that (1) conversations are very likely to
be considered gossip if all elements are
present, no intimate relationships exist
between the participants, and the person
in focus is unambiguous. (2) Conversa-
tions that have at most one gossip ele-
ment are not considered gossip. (3) Con-
versations that lack one or two elements
or have an ambiguous element lead to
inconsistent judgments.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999212137254902">
We are interested in creating believable charac-
ters, i.e. “characters that provide the illusion of
life” (Bates, 1994). Since people engage exten-
sively in gossip, such characters also need to be
able to understand and engage in gossip in or-
der to be believable in some situations. To en-
able characters to engage in gossip, we need a
computational model of gossip that can be ap-
plied in the authoring of such characters and/or
by the characters themselves. Unfortunately,
such a model does not yet exist.
Moreover, there is not yet a clear consensus
on how gossip should be defined, and most of
the definitions are too vague or too general to
be useful. Merriam-Webster online dictionary,
for example, defines gossip as “rumor or report
of an intimate nature” and “chatty talk”, neither
of which is specific enough. What we need is a
working definition that (a) matches people’s
intuitive notion of gossip to the extent possible,
given that the notion itself is somewhat vague,
and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis
for computational implementation.
More recent definitions (e.g. Eder and Enke,
1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al.,
2009) have been derived from analyzing tran-
scriptions of real gossip conversations. These
definitions have only minor individual differ-
ences and can in essence be formulated as
“evaluative talk about an absent third person”.
We have chosen to use this definition as a start-
ing point since it currently is the most specific
one and since it is based on the observed struc-
ture of naturally occurring gossip conversa-
tions.
This paper reports the results from two ex-
periments on gossip conversations. The first
experiment aimed at investigating what type of
conversations people intuitively perceive as
gossip. In the second study we also wanted to
find out whether the subjects would accept a
given definition and could apply it by identify-
ing three specified gossip elements.
The paper is structured as follows. In sec-
tion 2 we give a background to gossip with re-
spect to both its social function as well as its
conversational structure. Section 3 introduces
the experimental method. In sections 4 and 5
we present the two experiments and discuss the
results. In section 6, finally, we give some final
remarks and suggestions for future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.931125">
Gossip has been described as a mechanism for
social control (e.g. Gluckman, 1963; Fine and

Slade, 1997) that maintains “the unity, morals
and values of social groups” (Gluckman, 1963).
It has furthermore been suggested that gossip is
a form of “information-management”, primar-
ily to improve one’s self-image and “protect
individual interests” (Paine, 1967), but also to
influence others (Szwed, 1966; Fine and Ros-
now, 1978). Gossip can furthermore be viewed
as a form of entertainment (Abrahams, 1970) –
“a satisfying diversion from the tedium of rou-
tine activities” (Fine and Rosnow, 1978:164).
Recent studies have used a sociological ap-
proach focusing on analyzing the structure of
gossip conversations (e.g. Bergmann, 1993;
Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997;
Hallett et al., 2009). Rather than observing and
interviewing people in a certain community
about their gossip behavior, they have analyzed
transcripts of naturally occurring gossip con-
versations. Their studies show that gossipers
collaborate in creating the gossip, making it a
highly interactive genre. They also identified
two key elements of gossip:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.880209833333333">
• Third person focus – the identification
of an absent third person that is ac-
quainted with, but emotionally disjoint
from the other participants (Bergmann
(1993) refers to this as being “virtually”
absent, while Goodwin (1980) labels it
“symbolically” absent).
• An evaluation of the person in focus or
of his or her behavior. Eggins and
Slade (1997) propose that the evaluation
necessarily is pejorative to separate gos-
sip from other types of chat.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936049461538462">
Hallett et al. (2009) found that the gossipers
often use implicit evaluations to conceal the
critique, suggesting that the gossipers either
speak in general terms about something that
implicitly is understood to be about a certain
person, or that the gossipers avoid evaluating
the behavior under the assumption that the
evaluation is implicit in the behavior itself. In-
stead of specifying the evaluation as being pe-
jorative, they say it is “unsanctioned”.
In addition to the two elements described
above, Eggins and Slade (1997) propose a third
obligatory element:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7382208">
• Substantiating behavior – An elabora-
tion of the deviant behavior that can ei-
ther be used as a motivation for the nega-
tive evaluation, or as a way to introduce
gossip in the conversation. Eder and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901769230769">
Enke (1991) use a different model, but
the substantiating behavior component
corresponds roughly to their optional
Explanation act.
There seems to be a consensus that gossip
conversations have third person focus. The
question is whether a gossip conversation nec-
essarily has both a substantiating behavior
component as well as a pejorative evaluation
component, and if they do, can they be identi-
fied? In the experiments presented later in this
paper, we hope to shed light on whether these
components are necessary or not.

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992">
During the fall 2009, we conducted two ex-
periments about gossip conversations. The aim
of the experiments was to verify to what extent
the definition of gossip accords with intuitive
recognition of gossip episodes, and secondly
whether people could reliably identify constitu-
ent elements.
The data was collected using online ques-
tionnaires1 that were distributed through differ-
ent email-lists mainly targeting researchers and
students within game design, language technol-
ogy, and related fields, located primarily in
North America and Europe. The questionnaires
had the following structure: The first page con-
sisted of an introduction, including instructions,
and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt
retrieved from a screenplay followed by the
question and/or task.

<bodyText confidence="0.98811875">
Based on the previous studies presented earlier
(in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke,
1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the
following hypotheses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9979303">
• The more gossip elements present in the
text, the more likely the conversation
will be considered gossip.
• Third person focus is a necessary (but
not sufficient) element of gossip.
• Conversations in which the participants
(including the target) are intimately re-
lated will be rated lower than those in
which all participants are emotionally
separated.

terpret gossip conversations.

4.1 Material and procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.933976558823529">
The questionnaire contained 16 different dia-
logue excerpts retrieved from transcripts of the
famous sitcoms Desperate Housewives 2 and
Seinfeld3. The excerpts were selected to cover
different combinations of the elements pre-
sented in the previous section (third person fo-
cus, an evaluation, and a motivation for the
evaluation), as in the following dialogue4:
B: Tisha. Tisha. Oh, I can tell by that look
on your face you’ve got something good.
Now, come on, don’t be selfish.
T: Well, first off, you’re not friends with
Maisy Gibbons, are you?
B: No.
T: Thank god, because this is too good.
Maisy was arrested. While Harold was at
work, she was having sex with men in her
house for money. Can you imagine?
B: No, I can’t.
T: And that’s not even the best part. Word
is, she had a little black book with all her
clients’ names.
R: So, uh É you think that’ll get out?
T: Of course. These things always do.
Nancy, wait up. I can’t wait to tell you
this. Wait, wait.
A preliminary analysis to determine whether
the elements were present or not, was made by
the first author. The instructions contained no
information about the elements and no defini-
tion was given. To each excerpt we provided
some contextual information, such as the inter-
personal relationship between the speakers and
other people mentioned in the dialogue, e.g.:

The married couple, Bree (B) and Rex (R)
Van de Kamp, is having lunch at the club.
Some women laughing at the next table cause
the two of them to turn and look. One of their
acquaintances, Tisha (T), walks away from
that table and heads to another one. Maisy
Gibbons is another woman in their neigh-
borhood, known to be very dominant and
judgmental towards the other women.

It is apparent from the table that a few ex-
cerpts are clearly gossip or clearly not gossip,
but there is much disagreement on other ex-
cerpts. Inter-rater reliability is α = 0.437: well
above chance, but not particularly high6. Only
7 of the 16 excerpts (ID #2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15)
were clearly rated as gossip or not gossip by
more than half of the subjects, and only 5 of
those have a mean rating below 0.5 or above
2.5.
5 Presentation was ordered by ID, same for all subjects.
6 The reported value is Krippendorff’s α with the interval
distance metric (Krippendorff 1980). Interval α is defined
as 1 – Do/De, where Do (observed disagreement) is twice
the mean variance of the individual item ratings, and De
(expected disagreement) is twice the variance of all the
ratings. For the above table, Do = 1.327 and De = 2.585.

Despite the apparently low agreement, the
results correspond fairly well with our expecta-
tions. The 3 excerpts with a mean value below
0.5 had no gossip elements at all and the other
two excerpts with a median value of 0 had only
one gossip element. Similarly, the two excerpts
rated highest clearly had all gossip elements.
The rest of the excerpts, however, either lacked
one element or had one element that was un-
clear in some regard (see discussion, below).
Conversations between family members or
partners also caused higher disagreements,
which seem to support Bergmann’s (1993) re-
mark: “[É] we can ask whether we should call
gossip the conversations between spouses [É]
alone. This surely is a borderline case for which
there is no single answer” (p. 68).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.937715">
4.3 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865777777778">
Among the nine excerpts with a mean value
approximately between 1 and 2 (ID #1, 3, 4, 9,
10, 12, 13, 14, and 16), we made the following
observations: 3 excerpts lacked one element; in
2 of them, the gossipers were family members
or partners; 3 excerpts had an ambiguous focus,
among which one also possibly was perceived
as a warning.
By “ambiguous focus” we mean that it is un-
clear whether the person in focus is the speaker,
the addressee or the absent third person. In-
stead, the absent third person seems to play a
sub-ordinate role rather than focused role, for
instance as part of a self-disclosure or a con-
frontation. If the conversation is the least bit
confrontational, the addressee tends to go into
defense rather than choosing a more typical
gossip response, such as support, expansion, or
challenge (Eder and Enke, 1991) in order to
protect the face. Hence, no “gossip fuel” is
added to the conversation.
The result of the remaining excerpt7 is how-
ever more difficult to explain. One possible
explanation is that the initiator was unac-
quainted with the target, but perhaps more
likely is that some of the subjects interpreted
the conversation as mocking rather than gossip:

5 Experiment II: Identifying gossip
elements in a text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958611111111">
The aim of the second experiment was to inves-
tigate whether the subjects could accept and
apply a given definition by identifying the three
obligatory elements of gossip according to
Eggins and Slade (1997) (see section 2); third
person focus, pejorative evaluation, and sub-
stantiating behavior. In addition to the ele-
ments, we provided the more general definition
presented in section 1 (“evaluative talk about
an absent third person”).
The results from the first experiment indi-
cated that conversations that seemingly had all
the elements but in which the person in focus
was ambiguous, received a lower gossip rating
than those having an unambiguous third person
focus. So an additional goal was to investigate
whether changing the relationship between the
participants would affect the gossip rating.

We used excerpts from Seinfeld8, Desperate

which 8 also occurred in the first experiment.
Two of the recurring excerpts were used both
in their original versions as well as in modified
versions, in which we had removed the emo-
tional connections between the participants.

changing the interpersonal relationship would

conversation to be gossip or not gossip. If their
rating disagreed with the definition, i.e. if they
had found all the elements but still rated the
conversation as not gossip, or if one or more
elements were lacking but the conversation was
considered gossip anyway, they were asked to
specify why.

5.3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973976842105263">
We analyzed the results from the 19 subjects
who completed ratings for all 21 excerpts. This
gave a total of 399 yes/no judgments on 4 at-
tributes. Inter-coder reliability12 is shown in
Table 2. The easiest attribute to interpret is
third person focus. All but three of the subjects
marked either 4 or 5 excerpts as not having
third person focus, with the remaining subjects
not deviating by much (marking 3, 6, and 7
excerpts). Moreover, the subjects agree on
which excerpts have third person focus: only
one excerpt gets a substantial number of con-
flicting ratings (see the analysis given below in
section 5.4), while the remaining 20 excerpts
get consistent ratings from all subjects with
only occasional deviation by one or two of the
deviant subjects. This accounts for the high
observed agreement on this feature (94.9%).
Expected agreement is high because the corpus
is not balanced (16 of 21 excerpts display third
person focus), but even so, chance-corrected
agreement is high (85.1%), showing that third
person focus is an attribute that participants can
readily and reliably identify.
The remaining attributes, including gossip,
are less clear. Agreement on all of them is
clearly above chance, but is not particularly
high, showing that these notions are either not
fully defined, or that the excerpts are ambigu-
ous. Gossip itself is identified somewhat more
reliably than either substantiating behavior or
pejorative evaluation; this casts doubt about the
ability to use the latter two as defining features

tance metric. Observed agreement is defined as Ao = 1 –

features, we looked for co-occurrences among
the individual judgments. We have a total of
399 ratings (21 excerpts times 19 judges), each
with 4 attributes; these are distributed as shown
in Table 313. We can see that third person focus
is an almost necessary condition for classifying
a screenplay conversation as gossip, though it
is by no means sufficient. Tables 4–6 show the
co-occurrences of individual features to gossip;
the association is strongest between gossip and
third person focus and weakest between gossip
and pejorative evaluation.

be partly a reflection of awareness on their part
that the features are expected to go together,

we see that the subjects themselves differ in

<bodyText confidence="0.999977681818182">
We wanted to find out whether the subjects
would accept, understand and be able to apply a
given definition. The results from the experi-
ment showed that the subjects accepted the
given definition to some extent and managed to
apply it. When the subjects disagreed they were
asked to say why. One of the subjects, for ex-
ample, explicitly disagreed with the definition
given in the introduction and provided a
counter definition: “Gossip is idle talk or ru-
mor, especially about the personal or private
affairs of others”. Yet another subject was un-
certain about which definition to use: “Depends
what you mean by gossip. It can either mean
malicious, behind the back talk of other people
or idle chat. If you mean ‘idle chat’ with gos-
sip then this is also gossip”. A possible expla-
nation could be that the subjects refer to differ-
ent forms of gossip (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978)
and therefore apply different definitions (such
as the lexical definition presented earlier) than
the one that was given in the experiment.

Several subjects stated that they judged the
conversation as gossip even if they did not
identify any pejorative evaluation, and they
also questioned whether the evaluation had to
be negative or even present at all, or as one of
the subjects put it: “Although there is no pejo-
rative evaluation (at least not clearly) I believe
this is gossip”. These subjects thus explicitly
reject Eggins and Slade’s (1997) requirement
that the evaluation has to be pejorative.
The examples above show that people have
variable intuitions of gossip and consequently
the concept of gossip is somewhat vague. Even
so, the experiment also showed that people to a
large degree are in agreement when the exam-
ples according to the given definition clearly
are gossip or not gossip. Meaning that even
though the definition does not capture all types
of (potential) gossip conversations, it captures
those episodes that most people agree to be
gossip, which for our purpose is sufficient.

5.5 Effect of interpersonal relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999583396226415">
In some particular cases, the subjects did not
choose gossip even if all elements had been
found. The results from the first experiment
indicated that this deviation either was related
to the interpersonal relationship between the
gossip participants or that the focus was am-
biguous. In order to test whether changing the
inter-personal relationship between the partici-
pants would change the gossip rating, we com-
pared the results from the conversations we had
modified with their original counterparts. In
one of the original excerpts, the addressee was
romantically involved with the man that the
speaker was talking about. The speaker formu-
lated the negative assessment and deviant be-
havior in a way that for most people would be
interpreted as a warning, which probably ex-
plains why only 7 of the 19 subjects rated the
original conversation as gossip. The modified
version on the other hand, was rated as gossip
by all subjects.
In the second dialogue, the speaker questions
the addressee’s choice of person to date, and
does this by both evaluating the person nega-
tively as well as providing evidence for the
evaluation. It turns out, however, that the ad-
dressee thinks she is going out for a date with
someone else, so a large part of the conversa-
tion deals with trying to identify the target. 15
of 19 subjects rated the original conversation as
gossip, while all subjects rated it as gossip in
the modified version. These comparisons indi-
cate that the status of the relationship between
the gossipers and the gossip target affects
whether the dialogue is considered gossip or
not. In the original version of both these exam-
ples, the focus was ambiguous, i.e. the focus
was as much on the addressee as on the absent
third person.
We have shown that third person focus is a
key element of gossip. The correlation was fur-
thermore confirmed by the subjects themselves
in their comments, where the lack of third per-
son often was listed as a reason for not choos-
ing gossip. In one example, the respondent re-
garded the conversation as gossip even if it
really was an insult directed towards the ad-
dressee, but explained it as its “...almost like
he’s forgotten he’s talking to the person he’s
giving this opinion/gossip about”.
The highest disagreement concerning third
person focus was found in the following ex-
cerpt15:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.6696884">
Karen: Okay, what is it?
Gretchen: Regina says everyone hates you
because you’re such a slut.
Karen: She said that?
Gretchen: You didn’t hear it from me.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934130434783">
The dialogue contains an ambiguous focus in
that it both includes a quote as well as a con-
frontational insult. By using the third person
reference, Gretchen avoids taking responsibility
for the insult. In some sense both Karen and
Regina are in focus, where Karen is the target
of the pejorative evaluation and Regina can be
interpreted as being the focus of the substantiat-
ing behavior component. How Regina’s role is
interpreted is determined by the respondents’
personal attitude towards gossiping in general
(i.e. whether they interpret Gretchen’s utterance
as containing an implicit evaluation of Regina’s
behavior or not), and how they perceive the
interpersonal relationship between Karen and
Gretchen. Gossip has an inherent contradiction
in that it both has a function of negotiating the
accepted way to behave while it at the same
time often is considered an inappropriate activ-
ity that can have serious negative consequences
for both the gossipers as well as the gossip tar-
get (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978; Bergmann, 1993;
Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al., 2009).

6 Final remarks and future work want to avoid taking part in gossip conversa-

<bodyText confidence="0.999990346153846">
The aim of these studies has been to get a
workable definition of gossip that people can
agree upon and that is sufficiently precise to
provide a basis for computational implementa-
tion.
We conducted two experiments to investi-
gate people’s intuitive notion of gossip and the
results show that (1) conversations in which all
elements are present, where no intimate rela-
tionships exist between the participants, and in
which the person in focus is unambiguous, are
very likely to be considered gossip. (2) Conver-
sations that have at most one gossip element
are not considered gossip. (3) Inconsistencies
are mainly found in conversations that lack one
or two elements or have at least one element
that is ambiguous, or are taking place between
gossipers that have an intimate relationship.
We have suggested that third person focus is
a necessary, but not sufficient, element of gos-
sip, but the other elements are less clear even if
their co-occurrence in a conversation clearly
affects the gossip score. In the second experi-
ment this might be due to the instructions, but it
does not explain the unbiased results from the
first experiment. So on the one hand we can
clearly see that all three elements are important
for the understanding of gossip, but on the
other hand, the subjects’ had trouble in identi-
fying them. This suggests that we need to fur-
ther investigate these elements to see how they
can be specified more clearly.
We have taken a first step toward a computa-
tional account of gossip, by empirically verify-
ing the extent to which the given definition can
be applied and the components recognized by
people. Some of our next steps to further this
program include authoring content for believ-
able characters that follow this definition, as
well as attempting to automatically recognize
these elements.
Among the possible applications of gossip
we can think of game characters and virtual
humans that are capable of engaging in gossip
conversations to share information and create
social bonds with a human user or its avatar.
This involves being able to both generate gos-
sip on basis of the interpersonal relationship
and selecting content that could be regarded as
gossip, as well as to automatically detect gossip
occurring in a conversation. The latter use
could also be used for characters that actively

Since people engage extensively in gossip, such characters also need to be able to understand and engage in gossip in order to be believable in some situations. To enable characters to engage in gossip, we need a computational model of gossip that can be applied in the authoring of such characters and/or by the characters themselves. Unfortunately, such a model does not yet exist. Moreover, there is not yet a clear consensus on how gossip should be defined, and most of the definitions are too vague or too general to be useful.

Section 3 introduces the experimental method. In sections 4 and 5 we present the two experiments and discuss the results. In section 6, finally, we give some final remarks and suggestions for future work. 2 Background Gossip has been described as a mechanism for social control (e.g. Gluckman, 1963; Fine and Rosnow, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; Eggins and Proceedings of SIGDIAL 2010: the 11th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 193–200, The University of Tokyo, September 24-25, 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics 193 Slade, 1997) that maintains “the unity, morals and values of social groups” (Gluckman, 1963).

Eggins and Slade (1997) propose that the evaluation necessarily is pejorative to separate gossip from other types of chat. Hallett et al. (2009) found that the gossipers often use implicit evaluations to conceal the critique, suggesting that the gossipers either speak in general terms about something that implicitly is understood to be about a certain person, or that the gossipers avoid evaluating the behavior under the assumption</context>

The questionnaires had the following structure: The first page consisted of an introduction, including instructions, and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt retrieved from a screenplay followed by the question and/or task. 3.1 Hypotheses Based on the previous studies presented earlier (in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke, 1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the following hypotheses: • The more gossip elements present in the text, the more likely the conversation will be considered gossip. • Third person focus is a necessary (but not sufficient) element of gossip. • Conversations in which the participants (including the target) are intimately related will be rated lower than those in which all participants are emotionally separated. 1 Created using http://www.surveygizmo.com/ 194 4 Experiment I: Identifying gossip text The aim of the first experiment was to investigate how people intuitivel</context>

Moreover, there is not yet a clear consensus on how gossip should be defined, and most of the definitions are too vague or too general to be useful. Merriam-Webster online dictionary, for example, defines gossip as “rumor or report of an intimate nature” and “chatty talk”, neither of which is specific enough. What we need is a working definition that (a) matches people’s intuitive notion of gossip to the extent possible, given that the notion itself is somewhat vague, and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis for computational implementation. More recent definitions (e.g. Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al., 2009) have been derived from analyzing transcriptions of real gossip conversations. These definitions have only minor individual differences and can in essence be formulated as “evaluative talk about an absent third person”. We have chosen to use this definition as a starting point since it currently is the most specific one and since it is based on the observed structure of naturally occurring gossip conversations. This paper reports the results from two experiments on gossip conversations. The first experiment aimed at investigating what type of conv</context>

It has furthermore been suggested that gossip is a form of “information-management”, primarily to improve one’s self-image and “protect individual interests” (Paine, 1967), but also to influence others (Szwed, 1966; Fine and Rosnow, 1978). Gossip can furthermore be viewed as a form of entertainment (Abrahams, 1970) – “a satisfying diversion from the tedium of routine activities” (Fine and Rosnow, 1978:164).

Their studies show that gossipers collaborate in creating the gossip, making it a highly interactive genre. They also identified two key elements of gossip: • Third person focus – the identification of an absent third person that is acquainted with, but emotionally disjoint from the other participants (Bergmann (1993) refers to this as being “virtually” absent, while Goodwin</context>

Instead of specifying the evaluation as being pejorative, they say it is “unsanctioned”. In addition to the two elements described above, Eggins and Slade (1997) propose a third obligatory element: • Substantiating behavior – An elaboration of the deviant behavior that can either be used as a motivation for the negative evaluation, or as a way to introduce gossip in the conversation. Eder and Enke (1991) use a different model, but the substantiating behavior component corresponds roughly to their optional Explanation act. There seems to be a consensus that gossip conversations have third person focus. The question is whether a gossip conversation necessarily has both a substantiating behavior component as well as a pejorative evaluation component, and if they do, can they be identified? In the experiments presented later in this paper, we hope to shed light on whether these components are necessary or not. 3 Method During the fall 2009, we conducted two experiments about gossip conversations.</context>

The questionnaires had the following structure: The first page consisted of an introduction, including instructions, and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt retrieved from a screenplay followed by the question and/or task. 3.1 Hypotheses Based on the previous studies presented earlier (in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke, 1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the following hypotheses: • The more gossip elements present in the text, the more likely the conversation will be considered gossip. • Third person focus is a necessary (but not sufficient) element of gossip. • Conversations in which the participants (including the target) are intimately related will be rated lower than those in which all participants are emotionally separated. 1 Created using http://www.surveygizmo.com/ 194 4 Experiment I: Identifying gossip text The aim of the first experiment was to investigate how people intuitively understand and inte</context>

By “ambiguous focus” we mean that it is unclear whether the person in focus is the speaker, the addressee or the absent third person. Instead, the absent third person seems to play a sub-ordinate role rather than focused role, for instance as part of a self-disclosure or a confrontation. If the conversation is the least bit confrontational, the addressee tends to go into defense rather than choosing a more typical gossip response, such as support, expansion, or challenge (Eder and Enke, 1991) in order to protect the face. Hence, no “gossip fuel” is added to the conversation. The result of the remaining excerpt7 is however more difficult to explain. One possible explanation is that the initiator was unacquainted with the target, but perhaps more likely is that some of the subjects interpreted the conversation as mocking rather than gossip: E: Who’s that? D: That’s Sam, the new girl in accounting. W: What’s with her arms? They just hang like salamis. D: She walks like orangutan. E: Better call the zoo. 7 ID #14.

One of the subjects, for example, explicitly disagreed with the definition given in the introduction and provided a counter definition: “Gossip is idle talk or rumor, especially about the personal or private affairs of others”. Yet another subject was uncertain about which definition to use: “Depends what you mean by gossip. It can either mean malicious, behind the back talk of other people or idle chat. If you mean ‘idle chat’ with gossip then this is also gossip”. A possible explanation could be that the subjects refer to different forms of gossip (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978) and therefore apply different definitions (such as the lexical definition presented earlier) than the one that was given in the experiment. 198 Several subjects stated that they judged the conversation as gossip even if they did not identify any pejorative evaluation, and they also questioned whether the evaluation had to be negative or even present at all, or as one of the subjects put it: “Although there is no pejorative evaluation (at least not clearly) I believe this is gossip”.

Merriam-Webster online dictionary, for example, defines gossip as “rumor or report of an intimate nature” and “chatty talk”, neither of which is specific enough. What we need is a working definition that (a) matches people’s intuitive notion of gossip to the extent possible, given that the notion itself is somewhat vague, and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis for computational implementation. More recent definitions (e.g. Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett et al., 2009) have been derived from analyzing transcriptions of real gossip conversations. These definitions have only minor individual differences and can in essence be formulated as “evaluative talk about an absent third person”. We have chosen to use this definition as a starting point since it currently is the most specific one and since it is based on the observed structure of naturally occurring gossip conversations. This paper reports the results from two experiments on gossip conversations. The first experiment aimed at investigating what type of conversations people intuitively perceive as gossip</context>

Inter-rater reliability is α = 0.437: well above chance, but not particularly high6. Only 7 of the 16 excerpts (ID #2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15) were clearly rated as gossip or not gossip by more than half of the subjects, and only 5 of those have a mean rating below 0.5 or above 2.5. 5 Presentation was ordered by ID, same for all subjects. 6 The reported value is Krippendorff’s α with the interval distance metric (Krippendorff 1980). Interval α is defined as 1 – Do/De, where Do (observed disagreement) is twice the mean variance of the individual item ratings, and De (expected disagreement) is twice the variance of all the ratings. For the above table, Do = 1.327 and De = 2.585. 195 Despite the apparently low agreement, the results correspond fairly well with our expectations. The 3 excerpts with a mean value below 0.5 had no gossip elements at all and the other two excerpts with a median value of 0 had only one gossip element.
