<bodyText confidence="0.99973">
Crowd-sourcing approaches such as Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) make it pos-
sible to annotate or collect large amounts of
linguistic data at a relatively low cost and high
speed. However, MTurk offers only limited
control over who is allowed to particpate in
a particular task. This is particularly prob-
lematic for tasks requiring free-form text en-
try. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no
correct answer, and therefore control items
for which the correct answer is known can-
not be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no ef-
fective built-in mechanism to guarantee work-
ers are proficient English writers. We de-
scribe our experience in creating corpora of
images annotated with multiple one-sentence
descriptions on MTurk and explore the effec-
tiveness of different quality control strategies
for collecting linguistic data using Mechani-
cal MTurk. We find that the use of a qualifi-
cation test provides the highest improvement
of quality, whereas refining the annotations
through follow-up tasks works rather poorly.
Using our best setup, we construct two image
corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive
captions for 9000 images.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999779578947368">
Although many generic NLP applications can be de-
veloped by using existing corpora or text collections
as test and training data, there are many areas where
NLP could be useful if there was a suitable corpus
available. For example, computer vision researchers
are becoming interested in developing methods that
can predict not just the presence and location of cer-
tain objects in an image, but also the relations be-
tween objects, their attributes, or the actions and
events they participate in. Such information can
neither be obtained from standard computer vision
data sets such as the COREL collection nor from
the user-provided keyword tag annotations or cap-
tions on photo-sharing sites such as Flickr. Simi-
larly, although the text near an image on a website
may provide cues about the entities depicted in the
image, an explicit description of the image content
itself is typically only provided if it is not immedi-
ately obvious to a human what is depicted (in which
case we may not expect a computer vision system
to be able to recognize the image content either).
We therefore set out to collect a corpus of images
annotated with simple full-sentence descriptions of
their content. To obtain these descriptions, we used
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).1 MTurk is
an online framework that allows researchers to post
annotation tasks, called HITs (“Human Intelligence
Task”), then, for a small fee, be completed by thou-
sands of anonymous non-expert users (Turkers). Al-
though MTurk has been used for a variety of tasks in
NLP, our use of MTurk differs from other research
in NLP that uses MTurk mostly for annotation of
existing text. Similar to crowdsourcing-based an-
notation, quality control is an essential component
of crowdsourcing-based data collection efforts, and
needs to be factored into the overall costs. For us,
the quality of the text produced by the Turkers is
particularly important since we are interested in us-

ing this corpus for future research at the intersection
of computer vision and natural language processing.
However, MTurk provides limited ways to imple-
ment such quality control directly. For example, our
initial experiments yielded a data set that contained
many sentences that were clearly not written by na-
tive speakers. We learned that several steps must be
taken to ensure that Turkers both understand the task
and produce quality data.
This paper describes our experiences with Turk
(based on data collection efforts in spring and sum-
mer 2009), comparing two different approaches to
quality control. Although we did not set out to run a
scientific experiment comparing different strategies
of how to collect linguistic data on Turk, our expe-
rience points towards certain recommendations for
how to collect linguistic data on Turk.
2 The core task: image annotation
The PASCAL Data Set Every year, the Pat-
tern Analysis, Statistical Modeling, and Computa-
tional Learning (PASCAL) organization hosts the
Visual Object Classes Challenge (Everingham et al.,
2008). This is a competition similar to the shared
tasks familiar to the ACL community, where a com-
mon data set of images with classification and de-
tection information is released, and computer vision
researchers compete to create the best classification,
detection, and segmentation systems. We chose to
use this collection of images because it is a standard
resource for computer vision, and will therefore fa-
ciliate further research.
The VOC2008 development and training set con-
tains around 6000 images. It is categorized by ob-
jects that appear in the image, with some images ap-
pearing in multiple categories.2. The images con-
tain a wide variety of actions and scenery. Our cor-
pus consists of 1000 of these images, fifty randomly
chosen from each of the twenty categories.
MTurk setup We asked Turkers to write one de-
scriptive sentence for each of ten images. An ex-
ample annotation screen is shown in Figure 1. We

2The twenty categories include people, various animals,
vehicles and other objects: person, bird, cat, cow,
dog, horse, sheep, aeroplane, bicycle,
boat, bus, car, motorbike, train, bottle,
chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa,
tv/monitor

first showed the Turkers a list of instructive guide-
lines describing the task (Figure 6). The instruc-
tions told them to write ten complete but simple sen-
tences, to include adjectives if possible, to describe
the main characters, the setting, or the relation of
the objects in the image, to pay attention to gram-
mar and spelling, and to try to be concise. These
instructions were meant to both explain the task and
to prepare Turkers to write quality sentences. We
then showed each Turker a set of ten images, chosen
randomly from the 1000 total images, and displayed
one at a time. The Turkers navigated using “Next”
buttons through the ten annotation screens, each dis-
playing one image and one text-box. We allowed
Turkers ten minutes to complete one task.3 We re-
stricted the task to Turkers who have previously had
at least 95% of their results approved. We paid $0.10
to complete one task. The total cost for all 5000 de-
scriptions was $50 (plus Amazon’s 10% fee).

<bodyText confidence="0.998826066666667">
On average, Turkers wrote the ten sentences in a to-
tal of four minutes. The average pay rate was $1.30
per hour, and the whole experiment finished in under
two days. Five different people described each im-
age, and in the end, most of the Turkers completed
the task successfully, although 2.5% of the 5000 sen-
tences were empty strings. Turkers varied in the time
they took to complete the experiment, in the length
of their sentences, and in the level of detail they in-
cluded about the image. An example captioned im-
age is shown in Figure 2.
Problems with the data The quality of descrip-
tions varied greatly. We were hoping to collect sim-
ple sentences, written in correct English, describ-
ing the entities and actions in the images. More-

over, these are explicitly the types of descriptions we
asked for in the MTurk task instructions. Although
we found the descriptions acceptable more than half
of the time, a large number of the remaining descrip-
tions had at least one of the following two problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.725425777777778">
1. Some descriptions did not mention the salient
entities in the image, some were simply noun
phrases (or less), and some were humorous or
speculative.4 We find all of these to be prob-
lems because future computer vision and nat-
ural language processing research will require
accurate and consistent image captions.
2. A number of Turkers were not sufficiently pro-
ficient in English. Many descriptions contained

<bodyText confidence="0.888976888888889">
grammar and spelling errors, and some in-
cluded very awkward constructions. For exam-
ple, the phrase “X giving pose” showed up sev-
eral times in descriptions of images containing
people (e.g. “The lady and man giving pose.”).
Such spelling and grammar errors will pose dif-
ficulties for any standard text-processing algo-
rithms trained on native English.
Spell checking Due to the large number of mis-
spellings in in the initial data set, we first ran the sen-
tences first through our spell checker before putting
them up on Turk to assess their quality. We tok-
enized the captions with OpenNLP, and first checked
a manually created list of spelling corrections for
each token. These included canonicalizations (cor-
recting “surf board” as “surfboard”), words our au-
tomatic spell checker did not recognize (“mown”),
and the most common misspellings in our data set
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.95644425">
4For example, some Turkers commented on the feelings of
animals (e.g. “the dog is not very happy next to the dumpster”),
and others made jokes about the content of the image (e.g. “The
goat is ready for hair cut”)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.940025333333333">
(“shepard” to “shepherd”). If the token was not in
our manual list, we passed the word to aspell. From
aspell’s candidate corrections, we selected the most
frequent word that appeared either in other captions
of the same image, of images of the same topic, or
any caption in our data set.

3 Post-hoc quality control
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965391304348">
Because our initial data collection efforts resulted in
relatively noisy data, we created a new set of MTurk
tasks designed to provide post-hoc quality control.
Our aim was to filter out captions containing mis-
spellings and incorrect grammar.
MTurk setup Each HIT consisted of fifty differ-
ent image descriptions and asked Turkers to decide
for each of them whether they contained correct
grammar and spelling or not. At the beginning of
each HIT, we included a brief training phase, where
we showed the Turkers five example descriptions la-
beled as “correct” or “incorrect” (Figure 7). In the
HIT itself, the fifty descriptions were displayed in
blocks of five (albeit not for the same image) , and
each description was followed by two radio buttons
labeled “correct” and “incorrect”. We did not show
the corresponding images. A screenshot is shown in
Figure 3. Each block of five captions contained one
control item that we use for later assessment of the
Turkers’ spell-checking ability. We wrote these con-
trol captions ourselves, modeling them after actual
image descriptions. We paid $0.08 for one task, and
three people completed each task.

in under two days, at a total cost of $28.80 (plus
Amazon’s 10% fee). We also selected randomly
600 spell-checked sentences for expert annotation.
Three members of our team (all native speakers of
English) judged each of these sentences in the same
manner as the Turkers. Each sentence could there-
fore get between 0 and 3 Turker votes and between
0 and 3 expert votes for good English. The top two
rows of Table 1 show the distribution of votes in
each of the two groups. We also assess whether the
judgments of the Turkers correlate with our own ex-
pert judgments. Table 2(a) shows the overall agree-
ment between Turkers and expert annotators. The
rest of Table 2 shows how performance of the Turk-
ers on the control items affected agreement with ex-
pert judgments. We define the performance of a
Turker in terms of the average the number of con-
trol items that they got right in each HIT they took.
For each threshold in Tables 2(a)-(d), we considered
only those images for which we have three quality
judgments by workers whose performance is above
the specified threshold.
Our results show that the effectiveness of using
Turkers to filter for grammar and spelling issues is
limited. Overall, the Turker judgments were overly
harsh. The majority Turker vote agrees with the ma-
jority vote of the trained annotators on only 65.1%
of the sentences. Manual inspection of the differ-
ences reveals that the Turkers marked many per-
fectly grammatical English sentences as incorrect
(although they also marked a few which we had
missed). Agreement with experts decreases among
those Turkers that performed better on the control
sentences, with only 56.7% agreement for Turkers
that got all the controls right. In addition, the Turk-
ers are significantly more likely to report false nega-
tives over false positives and this also increases with
performance on the control sentences. (Overall, the
Turkers marked 29.9% of the sentences as false neg-
atives, whereas the Turkers that scored perfectly on
the controls marked 39.3% as false negatives.) Ex-
amination of the areas of high disagreement reveal
that the Turkers were much more likely to vote down
noun phrases than the experts were. The correct ex-
ample captions provided in the instructions of the
quality control test were complete sentences. Some
of the control captions were noun phrases, but all
of the noun phrase controls had some other error
in them. Thus it was possible to either believe that
noun phrases were correct or incorrect, and still be
consistent with the provided examples, and provide
correct judgments on the control sentences.

4 Quality control through pre-screening
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995694">
Quality control can also be imposed through a pre-
screening of the Turkers allowed to take the HIT. We
collected another set of five descriptions per image,
but restricted participation to Turkers residing in the
US5, and created a brief qualification test to check
their English. We would like to be able to restrict our
tasks to Turkers who are native speakers and com-
petent spellers and writers of English, regardless of
their country of residence. However, this seems to
be difficult to verify within the current MTurk setup.
Qualification Test Design The qualification test
consists of forty binary questions: fifteen testing
spelling, fifteen testing grammar, and ten testing the
ability to identify good image descriptions.
In all three cases, we started the section with a
set of instructions displaying examples of positive
and negative answers to the tasks. Each spelling
question consisted of a single sentence, and Turk-
ers were asked to determine if all of the words in
the sentence were spelled correctly and if the correct
word was being used (“lose” versus “loose”). Each
grammar question consisted of a single sentence that
was either correct or included a grammatical error.
Both spelling and grammar checking questions were
based on common mistakes made by foreign English

speakers and on grammatical or spelling errors that
occurred in our initial set of image captions. The
grammar and spelling questions are listed in Table
3. The image description questions consisted of one
image shown with two actual captions, and the Turk-
ers were asked which caption better described the
image. In order to pass the qualification test, we
required each annotator to correctly answer at least
twenty-four spelling and grammar questions and at
least eight image description questions. To prevent
Turkers from using the number of question they got
correct to do a brute force search for the correct an-
swers, we simply told them if they passed (“1”) or
failed (“0”). Currently, 1504 people have taken the
qualification test, with a 67.2% passing rate. Since
this qualification test was only required for our HITs
that were restricted to US residents, we assume (but
are not able to verify) that most, if not all, of the
people who took this test are actually US residents.

MTurk Set-up We use the same MTurk set-up as
before, but to encourage Turkers to complete the
task even though they first have to pass a qualifica-
tion test, we pay them $0.10 to annotate five images.

matically correct but useless fragments such as “very
dark” and “peace” only appear without a test. After
requiring the qualification test, the major reasons for
rejection by Turkers are typos such as in “The two
dogs blend in with the stuff animals” or missing de-
terminers such as in “a train on tracks in town”.
We found that the Turkers who passed the qualifica-
tion provided much better captions for the images.
The average time spent on each image was longer
(four minutes per ten images for the non-qualified
workers versus five minutes per ten images for the
qualified workers). On average, qualified Turk-
ers produced slightly longer sentences (avg. 10.7
words) than non-qualified workers (avg. 10.0 words)
(Figure 4), and the awkward constructions produced
by the unqualified workers were mostly absent. The
entire corpus was annotated in 253 hours at a cost of
$100.00 (plus Amazon’s 10% fee).
We also looked at the rate of misspellings (ap-
proximated by how often our spell-checker indicated
a misspelling). Without the qualification test, Out
of the 600 sentences produced without the qualifica-
tion test, 78 contained misspellings, whereas only 25
sentences out of the 600 produced by the qualified
workers contained misspellings. Furthermore, mis-
spellings in the no-qualification group include many
genuine errors (“the boys are playing in tabel”,
“bycycles“, “eatting”), whereas misspellings in the
qualification group are largely typos (e.g. Ywo for
Two, tableclothe, chari for chair). Furthermore, the
spell checker corrected all 25 misspellings in the
qualified data set to the intended word, but 27 out of
the 78 misspellings in the data produced by the un-
qualified workers got changed to some other word.
The same three members of our team rated again
the English of 600 randomly selected sentences writ-
ten by Turkers residing in the US who passed our
test. We found a significant improvement in quality
(Table 1, bottom row), with the majority expert vote
accepting over 97% of the sentences. This is also
corroborated by qualitative analysis of the data (see
Figure 5 for examples). Inspection reveals that sen-
tences that are deemed ungrammatical by the experts
typically contain some undetected typo, and would
be correct if these typos could be fixed. Without a
qualification test, there is a significantly greater per-
centage of nonsensical responses such as: “Is this a
bird squirrel?” and “thecentury”. In addition, gram-
Overall cost effectiveness Using the no qualifica-
tion test approach, we first paid $50.00 to get 5000
sentences written by unqualified Turkers (which re-
sulted in 4851 non-empty sentences). This resulted
in low-quality data which required further verifica-
tion. Since this is too time-consuming for expert an-
notators, we then paid another $28.80 to get each of
these sentences subsequently checked by three Turk-
ers for grammaticality, resulting in 2222 sentences
which received at least two positive votes for gram-
maticality. With the qualification test approach, we
paid $100.00 to get 5000 sentences written. Based
on our experiments on the set of 600 sentences, ex-
perts would judge over 97% of these sentences as
correct, thus obviating the immediate need for fur-
ther control. That is, it effectively costs more for
non-qualified Turkers to produce sentences that are
judged to be good than for qualified Turkers. Fur-
thermore, their sentences will probably be of lower
quality even after they have been judged acceptable.

Related work MTurk has been used for many dif-
ferent NLP and vision tasks (Tietze et al., 2009;
Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2009; Snow et al., 2008;
Sorokin and Forsyth, 2008). Due to the noise in-
herent in non-expert annotations, many other at-
tempts at quality control have been made. Kit-
tur et al. (2008) solicit ratings about different as-
pects of Wikipedia articles. At first they receive
very noisy results, due to Turkers’ not paying at-
tention when completing the task or specifically try-
ing to cheat the requester. They remade the task,
this time starting by asking the Turkers verifiable
questions, speculating that the users would produce
better quality responses when they suspect their an-
swers will be checked. They also added a question
that required the Turkers to comprehend the con-
tent of the Wikipedia article. With this new set-
up, they find that the quality greatly increases and
carelessness is reduced. Kaisser and Lowe (2008)
7Our final data set consists of 1482 pictures from action pho-
tography, 1904 from dogs, 776 from flickr-social, 916 from out-
door, 1257 from strangers and 1773 from wild-child.
8Note that the annotation process scaled pretty well, con-
sidering that annotating more than eight times the number of
images took only 31 hours longer.
collected question and answer pairs by presenting
Turkers with a question and telling them to copy and
paste from a document of text they know to contain
the answer. They achieve a good but far from per-
fect interannotator agreement based on the extracted
answers. We speculate that the quality would be
much worse if the Turkers wrote the sentences them-
selves. Callison-Burch (2009) asks Turkers to pro-
duce translations when given reference sentences in
other languages. Overall, he finds find that Turk-
ers produce better translations than machine transla-
tion systems. To eliminate translations from Turkers
who simply put the reference sentence into an online
translation website, he performs a follow-up task,
where he asks other Turkers to vote on if they believe
that sentences were generated using an online trans-
lation system. Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009) ask
Turkers to produce 4-5 sentence opinion paragraphs
about the death penalty, about abortion and describ-
ing a friend. They report that aside from a small
number of invalid responses, all of the paragraphs
were of good quality and followed their instructions.
Their success is surprising to us because they do not
report using a qualification test, and when we did
this our responses contained a large amount of in-
correct English spelling and grammar.
The TurKit toolkit (Little et al., 2009) provides
another approach to improving the quality of MTurk
annotations. Their iterative framework allows the
requester to set up a series of tasks that first solic-
its text annotations from Turkers and then asks other
Turkers to improve the annotations. They report suc-
cessful results using this methodology, but we chose

to stick with simply using the qualification test be-
cause it achieves the desired results already. Fur-
thermore, although using TurKit would have proba-
bly done away with our few remaining grammar and
spelling mistakes, it may have caused the captions
for an image to be a little too similar, and we value
a diversity in the use of words and points of view.
Our experiences We have described our experi-
ences in using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in the
first half of 2009 to create a corpus of images anno-
tated with descriptive sentences. We implemented
two different approaches to quality control: first, we
did not impose any restrictions on who could write
image descriptions. This was then followed by a sec-
ond set of MTurk tasks where Turkers had to judge
the quality of the sentences generated in our initial
Turk experiments. This approach to quality control
would be cost-effective if the initial data were not
too noisy and the subsequent judgments were ac-
curate and cheap. However, this was not the case,
and quality control on the judgments in the form of
control items turned out to result in even lower ac-
curacy. We then repeated our data collection effort,
but required that Turkers live in the US and take a
brief qualification test that we created to test their
English. This is cost-effective if English proficiency
can be accurately assessed in such a brief qualifica-
tion test. We found that the latter approach was in-
deed far cheaper, and produced significantly better
data. We did not set out to run a scientific experi-
ment comparing different strategies of how to col-
lect linguistic data on Turk, and therefore there may
be multiple explanations for the effects we observe.
Nevertheless, our experience indicates strongly that
even very simple prescreening measures can provide
very effective quality control.
We also extended our corpus to include 8000 im-
ages collected from Flickr. We hope to release this
data to the public for future natural language pro-
cessing and computer vision research.
Recommended practices for using MTurk in NLP
Our experience indicates that with simple prescreen-
ing, linguistic data can be elicited fairly cheaply and
rapidly from crowd-sourcing services such as Me-
chanical Turk. However, many applications may re-
quire more control over where the data comes from.
Even though NLP data collection differs fundamen-
tally from psycholinguistic experiments that may
elicit production data, our community will typically
also need to know whether data was produced by na-
tive speakers or not. Until MTurk provides a better
mechanism to check the native language of its work-
ers, linguistic data collection on MTurk will have to
rely on potentially very noisy input.

<abstract confidence="0.997174851851852">Crowd-sourcing approaches such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) make it possible to annotate or collect large amounts of linguistic data at a relatively low cost and high speed. However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images.</abstract>

At first they receive very noisy results, due to Turkers’ not paying attention when completing the task or specifically trying to cheat the requester. They remade the task, this time starting by asking the Turkers verifiable questions, speculating that the users would produce better quality responses when they suspect their answers will be checked.
