This paper presents preliminary
experiments in the use of translation
equivalences to disambiguate
prepositions or case suffixes. The core
of the method is to find translations of
the occurrence of the target preposition
or case suffix, and assign the
intersection of their set of
interpretations. Given a table with
prepositions and their possible
interpretations, the method is fully
automatic. We have tested this method
on the occurrences of the Basque
instrumental case -z in the definitions of
a Basque dictionary, looking for the
translations in the definitions from 3
Spanish and 3 English dictionaries. The
results have been that we are able to
disambiguate with 94.5% accuracy
2.3% of those occurrences (up to 91).
The ambiguity is reduced from 7
readings down to 3.1. The results are
very encouraging given the simple
techniques used, and show great
potential for improvement.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940666666667">
This paper presents some preliminary experiments
in the use of translation equivalences to
disambiguate the interpretations of case suffixes in
Basque. Basque is an agglutinative language, and
its case suffixes are more or less equivalent to
prepositions, but are also used to mark the subject
and objects of verbs. The method is general, and
could be as easily applied to prepositions in any
other language. The core of the method is to find a
preposition in the translation of an occurrence of
the target case suffix, and select the
interpretation(s) in the intersection of both as the
valid interpretation(s). At this point, we have not
used additional sources for the disambiguation,
e.g. governing verbs, nouns, etc., but they could
complement the technique here presented.
In this particular experiment, the method was
tested on the definitions of a Basque monolingual
dictionary, using the -z instrumental as the target
case suffix. The main reason is that we are in the
process of building a Lexical Knowledge Base out
of dictionary definitions, and the disambiguation
of case suffixes and other semantic dependencies
is of great interest.
The method searches for the respective
definitions in English and Spanish monolingual
dictionaries and tries to find a preposition that is
the translation of the target case suffix. Once the
preposition is found, the intersection of the set of
interpretations of both the source case suffix and
the translated preposition is taken, and the
outcome is stored.
The resources needed to perform this task are
the following: lemmatizers, bilingual dictionaries
and monolingual dictionaries, as well as a table of
possible interpretations of prepositions and case
suffixes. In our case, we have used Basque,
English and Spanish lemmatizers, Basque/English
and Basque/Spanish bilingual dictionaries, a target
Basque monolingual dictionary, 3 Spanish and 3
English monolingual dictionaries.
The method is fully automatic; the Spanish and
English monolingual dictionaries are accessed
from the Internet, and the rest are local, installed
in our machines. The manual work has been to
build the table with possible interpretations of the
prepositions and case suffixes.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
presents the method for disambiguation in detail.
Section 3 introduces the interpretations for the
case suffix and the prepositions. The results are
shown in Section 4, which are further discussed in
Section 5. Finally, section 6 presents the
conclusions and future work.

2 Method for disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998815857142857">
The goal of the method is to disambiguate
between the possible interpretations of a case
suffix appearing in any text. We have taken as the
target text the definitions from a monolingual
Basque dictionary Euskal Hiztegia, EH in short
(Sarasola, 1996). The method consists on five
steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9863172">
• Extraction of the definitions in EH where the
target case suffix occurs.
• Search of on-line Spanish and English
dictionaries to obtain the translation
equivalent of the definitions.
• Extraction of the target preposition from the
translation definitions.
• Disambiguation based on the intersection of
the interpretations of case suffix and
prepositions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994411">
We will explain each step in turn.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999631">
2.1 Extraction of relations from EH
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982591133333333">
Given a case suffix, in this step we will search the
EH dictionary for occurrences of the case suffix.
We first lemmatize and perform morphological
analysis of the definitions (Aduriz et. al, 1996).
The definitions that contain the target case suffix
in a morphological analysis are extracted, storing
the following information: the Basque dictionary
entry of the definition, the lemma that has the case
suffix, the case suffix, and the following lemma.
Below we can see a sample definition, its
lemmatized version, and the two triples extracted
from this definition. The occurrences of the
instrumental -z are shown in bold.

Extracting lemma-suffix-lemma triples in this
simple way leads to some errors (cf. section 5.1).
For instance, the first triple should rather be the
dependency golde#INS#irauli (plow#with#turn, to
be read in reverse order). We will see that even in
this case we will be able to obtain correct
translations and disambiguate the preposition
correctly. Nevertheless, in the future we plan to
use a syntactic parser to identify better the lemmas
that are related by the case suffix.

2.2 Search for Spanish/English

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998773425">
After we have a list of entries in the Basque
dictionary that contain the lemma-suffix-lemma
triple, we search for their equivalent definitions in
Spanish and English. We first look up the entry in
the bilingual dictionary, and then retrieve the
over the ground with a plow.
2 The translation of the first triple is plow#with#ground,
to be read on reverse. The translation of the second is
turn#NULL#produce, to be also read on reverse. In this
second triple the instrumental case suffix is not
translated explicitly by a preposition, but by a syntactic
construct.
definitions for each of the possible translations
from the monolingual dictionaries.
We use two bilingual and 6 monolingual
Machine Readable Dictionaries: Morris
Basque/English dictionary (Morris, 1998) Elhuyar
Basque/Spanish dictionary (Elhuyar, 1996);
English monolingual on-line dictionaries are:
Cambridge (online), Heritage (online), and
Wordsmyth (online); and Spanish monolingual
on-line dictionaries are: Colmex (online), Rae
(online), and Vox (online). The Basque dictionary
and the bilingual dictionaries are stored in a local
server, while the monolingual dictionaries are
accessed from the Internet using a wrapper.
The incomplete list of the translation of ildo
(furrow in English, surco in Spanish) is shown
below. Note that we got two different definitions
for surco, coming from different Spanish
dictionaries.

2.3 Extraction of Spanish/English
equivalent relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9949215">
Given a list of definitions in Spanish and English,
we search in the definition the translation of the
Basque triple found in step 2.1, that is, we look for
a triple of consecutive words where the first word
is the translation of the last word in the Basque
triple, the second word is a preposition (which
corresponds to the Basque suffix) and the third
word is the translation of the first word in the
Basque triple. Between the preposition and the last
word in the triple we allow for the presence of a
determiner or an adjective in the text. More
complex patterns could be allowed, up to full
syntactic analyses, but at this point we follow this
simple scheme.
Below we can find the triples for
golde#INS#lur, obtained from the three definitions
above. One triple is obtained twice from two
different definitions.
furrow#ground#by#plow
surco#tierra#con#arado
surco#tierra#con#arado
Definitions that do not have a matching triple
are discarded, leaving Basque triples without
matching triple ambiguous. For instance we could
not find triples for irauli#INS#egin(cf. example in
section 2.1). The instrumental suffix is sometimes
translated without prepositions (in this case “...
made turning ...”).
Looking up the bilingual dictionaries for
translation requires lemmatization and Part of
Speech tagging. For English we use the TnT PoS
tagger (Brants, 2000) and WordNet for
lemmatization (Miller et al., 1990). For Spanish
we use (Atserias et al., 1998).

2.4 Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.89934452631579">
For each Basque case suffix, Spanish preposition
and English preposition we have a list of
interpretations (cf. Table 1). We assign the
interpretations of the preposition to each
Spanish/English triple. The intersection of all the
interpretations is assigned to it.
Continuing with out example, we can see that
the intersection between the interpretations of the
English by preposition (three interpretations) and
the interpretations of the Spanish con preposition
(four interpretations) are manner and instrument.
Therefore, we can say that the Basque
instrumental case interpretation in this case will
be manner or instrument.

The method explained in the previous section is
fully automatic, and it only requires the list of
interpretations for each case suffix and
preposition. In this work, we want to evaluate if
the overall approach is feasible, so we selected
Basque as the target language and a single case
suffix, -z the instrumental case. Table 1 shows the
list of possible interpretations and Table 2 and 3
examples for each interpretation.
The sources for the interpretations of the
instrumental case have been a grammar of Basque
(Euskaltzaindia, 1985) and a bilingual dictionary
(Elhuyar, 1996). Possible interpretations for
Spanish and English prepositions have been taken
from an English dictionary (Cambridge, online), a
Spanish dictionary (Vox, online) and a Spanish
grammar (Bosque &amp; Demonte, 1999).
For this work we have taken a descriptive
approach, but other more theoretically committed
approaches are also possible. The overall method
is independent of the set of interpretations, as it
only needs a table of possible interpretations in the
style of Table 1. Section 5.4 further discusses
other alternatives.
In order to disambiguate the occurrences of the
instrumental case suffix we have taken the
Spanish and English translations for this case
suffix. The list of possible translations is
preliminary and covers what we found necessary
to make this experiment. Table 1 shows the list of
prepositions and interpretations for Spanish and
English. Examples of the interpretations can be
found in Table 2. The Spanish preposition de had
the same interpretations as the instrumental case
suffix (cf. Table1), so it was discarded.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999355461538461">
The instrumental case occurs in 4,004 different
definitions in the EH dictionary. The algorithm in
Section 2 was applied to all these definitions,
yielding a result for 125 triples, 3.1% of the total.
The triples for which we had an answer were
tagged by hand independently, i.e. not consulting
the results output by the algorithm. The hand-
tagged set constitutes what we call the gold
standard.
A single linguist made the tagging, consulting
other teammates when in doubt. Apart from
marking the interpretation, there were some other
special cases.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969344444444444">
1. In some of the examples, the instrumental
case was part of a more complex scheme, and
was tagged accordingly:
• Part of a postposition (XPOST), e.g. -en
bidez (by means of) or -en ordez (instead
of).
• Part of a conjunction (XLOK), e.g. batez
ere (specially).
• Part of a compounded suffix –zko
(XZKO), which results from the
aggregation of the instrumental –z with
the location genitive -ko.
2. There were three errors in the lemmatization
process (XLEM), due to lexicalized items, e.g.
gizonezko (meaning male person).
3. Finally, the relation in the definition was
sometimes wrongly retrieved, e.g.
• The triple would contain the determiner or
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982103782608696">
an adjective instead of the dependencies.
We thought that the algorithm would be
able to work well even with those cases,
so we decided to keep them.
• The triple contains a conjunction (X) :
these were tagged as incorrect.
Table 4 shows the amount of such cases,
alongside the frequency of each interpretation.
The most frequent interpretation is instrument. In
seven examples, the linguist decided to keep two
interpretations: instrument and manner. In a single
example, the linguist was unable to select an
interpretation, so this example was discarded.
The output of the algorithm was compared
with the gold standard, yielding the accuracy
figures in Table 5. An output was considered
correct if it yielded at least one interpretation in
common with the gold standard. The accuracy is
given for each dictionary in isolation, or merging
all the results (as mentioned in section 2, when
two dictionaries propose interpretations for the
same triple, their intersection is taken). The
remaining ambiguity is 3.1 overall.

The obtained results show a very good accuracy,
leaving a remaining ambiguity of 3.1 results per
example. This means that we were able to discard
an average of 4 readings for each of the examples,
introducing only 5.5% of error. The results are
practically equal to the most frequent baseline,
which is usually hard to beat using knowledge-
based techniques.
Coverage of the method is very low, only
2.3%, but this was not an issue for us, as we plan
to couple this method with other Machine
Learning techniques in a bootstrapping
framework. Nevertheless, we are still interested in
increasing the coverage, in order to obtain more
training data.
Next, we will analyze more in depth the causes
of the low coverage, the sources of the errors and
ambiguity and the interpretations of case suffixes
and prepositions.

5.1 Sources of low coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996394117647">
As soon as we started devising this method, it was
clear to us that the coverage will be rather low.
The main reason is that different dictionaries tend
to give different details in their definitions, or use
differing paraphrases. This fact is intrinsic to our
method, and accounts for the large majority of
missing answers.
On the other hand, the simple method used to
find triples means that a change in the order of the
complements will cause our method to fail
looking for a translation triple. Syntactic analysis,
even shallow parsing methods, will help increase
the coverage.
Another source of discarded triples are the
cases where the suffix is not translated by a
preposition, e.g. the relation is carried out by a
subject or direct object. When syntactic analysis is

- luma/feedle: odi batez osatua/wake made by

residual ambiguity. Alternative sets of
interpretations (cf. Section 5.4) with coarser

Different authors give differing interpretations for

descriptive list of possible interpretations from a
set of sources, mainly dictionaries and grammar
books.
This work covers only the instrumental case
suffix and its translations to English and Spanish.
If tables for all case suffixes and prepositions were
built, the method could be applied to all case
suffixes and prepositions, yielding disambiguated
relations in all three languages.
More theoretically committed lists of
interpretations (Dorr et al., 1998; Civit et al.,
2000; Sowa, 2000) should also be considered, but
unfortunately we have not found a full account for
all prepositions. If such a full table of
interpretations existed, it could be very easy to
apply our method, and obtain the outcome in

6 Conclusion and further work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984265306122">
This paper presents preliminary experiments in the
use of translation equivalences to disambiguate
prepositions or case suffixes. The core of the
method is to find translations of the occurrence of
the target preposition or case suffix, and assign the
intersection of their set of interpretations. The
method is fully automatic, given a table with
prepositions and their possible interpretations.
We have tested this method on the occurrences
of the Basque instrumental case -z in the
definitions of a Basque dictionary. We have
searched the translations in the definitions from 3
Spanish and 3 English dictionaries.
The results have been that we are able to
disambiguate with 94.5% accuracy 2.3% of those
occurrences (up to 91). The ambiguity is reduced
from 7 readings down to 3.1. We think that these
are very good results, especially seeing that there
is room for improvement.
More specifically, we plan to apply surface
syntactic analysis to better extract the dependency
relations, which is the main source of errors. We
would like to study other inventories of
preposition interpretations, both in order to have
better theoretical foundations as well as to
investigate whether coarser grained distinctions
would lead to a reduction in the ambiguity.
In the future, we plan to explore the possibility
to feed a Machine Learning algorithm with the
automatically disambiguated examples, in order to
construct a full-fledged disambiguation algorithm
following a bootstrapping approach. On the other
hand, we would like to apply the method to the set
of all prepositions and case suffixes, and beyond
that to all syntactic dependencies. The results will
be directly loaded in a Lexical Knowledge Base
extracted from the Basque dictionary (Ansa et al.,
in prep.).
We also plan to explore whether this method
can be applied to free running text, removing the
constraint that the translations have to be
definitions of the equivalent word.
Finally, this technique could be coupled with
techniques that make use of the semantic types of
the words in the context.
Overall, we found the results are very
encouraging given the simple techniques used,
and we think that it shows great potential for
improvement and interesting avenues for research.

<abstract confidence="0.999468736196319">This paper presents experiments in the use of translation equivalences to prepositions or case suffixes. The core of the method is to find translations of the occurrence of the target preposition or case suffix, and assign the intersection of their set of interpretations. Given a table with prepositions and their possible interpretations, the method is fully automatic. We have tested this method on the occurrences of the Basque case the definitions of a Basque dictionary, looking for the translations in the definitions from 3 Spanish and 3 English dictionaries. The results have been that we are able to disambiguate with 94.5% accuracy 2.3% of those occurrences (up to 91). The ambiguity is reduced from 7 readings down to 3.1. The results are very encouraging given the simple techniques used, and show great potential for improvement. This paper presents some preliminary experiments in the use of translation equivalences to disambiguate the interpretations of case suffixes in Basque. Basque is an agglutinative language, and its case suffixes are more or less equivalent to prepositions, but are also used to mark the subject and objects of verbs. The method is general, and could be as easily applied to prepositions in any other language. The core of the method is to find a preposition in the translation of an occurrence of the target case suffix, and select the interpretation(s) in the intersection of both as the valid interpretation(s). At this point, we have not used additional sources for the disambiguation, e.g. governing verbs, nouns, etc., but they could complement the technique here presented. In this particular experiment, the method was tested on the definitions of a Basque monolingual using the as the target case suffix. The main reason is that we are in the process of building a Lexical Knowledge Base out of dictionary definitions, and the disambiguation of case suffixes and other semantic dependencies is of great interest. The method searches for the respective definitions in English and Spanish monolingual dictionaries and tries to find a preposition that is the translation of the target case suffix. Once the preposition is found, the intersection of the set of interpretations of both the source case suffix and the translated preposition is taken, and the outcome is stored. The resources needed to perform this task are the following: lemmatizers, bilingual dictionaries and monolingual dictionaries, as well as a table of possible interpretations of prepositions and case suffixes. In our case, we have used Basque, English and Spanish lemmatizers, Basque/English and Basque/Spanish bilingual dictionaries, a target Basque monolingual dictionary, 3 Spanish and 3 English monolingual dictionaries. The method is fully automatic; the Spanish and English monolingual dictionaries are accessed from the Internet, and the rest are local, installed in our machines. The manual work has been to build the table with possible interpretations of the prepositions and case suffixes. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the method for disambiguation in detail. Section 3 introduces the interpretations for the case suffix and the prepositions. The results are shown in Section 4, which are further discussed in Section 5. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions and future work. for disambiguation The goal of the method is to disambiguate between the possible interpretations of a case suffix appearing in any text. We have taken as the target text the definitions from a monolingual dictionary short (Sarasola, 1996). The method consists on five steps: Extraction of the definitions in the target case suffix occurs. • Search of on-line Spanish and English dictionaries to obtain the translation equivalent of the definitions. • Extraction of the target preposition from the translation definitions. • Disambiguation based on the intersection of the interpretations of case suffix and prepositions. We will explain each step in turn. Extraction of relations from Given a case suffix, in this step we will search the for occurrences of the case suffix. We first lemmatize and perform morphological analysis of the definitions (Aduriz et. al, 1996). The definitions that contain the target case suffix in a morphological analysis are extracted, storing the following information: the Basque dictionary entry of the definition, the lemma that has the case suffix, the case suffix, and the following lemma. Below we can see a sample definition, its lemmatized version, and the two triples extracted from this definition. The occurrences of the shown in bold. Ildo iz. A1 Goldeaz lurra irauliz den irekidura literal translation of the definition is the : a long trench produced turning /&lt;@@lema ildo&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;/ /&lt;@@Adiera_string A1.&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;/ /&lt;@@Kategoria iz. &amp;quot;&lt;Goldeaz&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;golde&amp;quot; IZE ARR DEK INS NUMS MUGM &amp;quot;&lt;lurra&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lur&amp;quot; IZE ARR DEK ABS NUMS MUGM &amp;quot;&lt;irauliz&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;irauli&amp;quot; ADI SIN AMM PART DEK INS MG &amp;quot;&lt;egiten&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;egin&amp;quot; ADI SIN AMM ADOIN ASP EZBU &amp;quot;&lt;den&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;izan&amp;quot; ADL A1 NOR NR_HU ERL MEN ERLT &amp;quot;&lt;irekidura&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;irekidura&amp;quot; IZE ARR DEK ABS MG &amp;quot;&lt;luzea&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;luze&amp;quot; ADJ IZO DEK ABS NUMS MUGM &amp;quot;&lt;$.&gt;&amp;quot; PUNT_PUNT irauli#INS#egin Extracting lemma-suffix-lemma triples in this simple way leads to some errors (cf. section 5.1). For instance, the first triple should rather be the to be read in reverse order). We will see that even in this case we will be able to obtain correct translations and disambiguate the preposition correctly. Nevertheless, in the future we plan to use a syntactic parser to identify better the lemmas that are related by the case suffix. 2.2 Search for Spanish/English translations After we have a list of entries in the Basque dictionary that contain the lemma-suffix-lemma triple, we search for their equivalent definitions in Spanish and English. We first look up the entry in the bilingual dictionary, and then retrieve the the ground with a translation of the first triple is to be read on reverse. The translation of the second is to be also read on reverse. In this second triple the instrumental case suffix is not translated explicitly by a preposition, but by a syntactic construct. definitions for each of the possible translations from the monolingual dictionaries.</abstract>

Note that we got two different definitions from different Spanish dictionaries. furrow#A long , narrow , shallow trench made in the ground by a plow surco#Excavación alargada , angosta y poco profunda que se hace paralelamente en la tierra con el arado , para sembrarla después surco#Hendedura que se hace en la tierra con el arado 2.3 Extraction of Spanish/English equivalent relations Given a list of definitions in Spanish and English, we search in the definition the translation of the Basque triple found in step 2.1, that is, we look for a triple of consecutive words where the first word is the translation of the last word in the Basque triple, the second word is a preposition (which corresponds to the Basque suffix) and the third word is the translation of the first word in the Basque triple. Between the preposition and the last word in the triple we allow for the presence of a determiner or an adjective in the text. More complex patterns could be allowed, up to full syntactic analyses, but at this point we follow this simple scheme. Below we can find the triples for obtained from the three definitions above. One triple is obtained twice from two different definitions. furrow#ground#by#plow surco#tierra#con#arado surco#tierra#con#arado Definitions that do not have a matching triple are discarded, leaving Basque triples without matching triple ambiguous. For instance we could find triples for example in section 2.1). The instrumental suffix is sometimes without prepositions (in this case turning Looking up the bilingual dictionaries for translation requires lemmatization and Part of Speech tagging. For English we use the TnT PoS tagger (Brants, 2000) and WordNet for lemmatization (Miller et al., 1990). For Spanish we use (Atserias et al., 1998). 2.4 Disambiguation For each Basque case suffix, Spanish preposition and English preposition we have a list of interpretations (cf. Table 1). We assign the interpretations of the preposition to each Spanish/English triple. The intersection of all the interpretations is assigned to it. Continuing with out example, we can see that the intersection between the interpretations of the (three interpretations) and interpretations of the Spanish interpretations) are Therefore, we can say that the Basque interpretation in this case will furrow#ground#by a#plow# manner instrument during-time surco#tierra#con el#arado# manner instrument cause containing golde#INS#lur#instrument manner for the instrumental case suffix and equivalent prepositions The method explained in the previous section is fully automatic, and it only requires the list of interpretations for each case suffix and preposition. In this work, we want to evaluate if the overall approach is feasible, so we selected Basque as the target language and a single case instrumental case. Table 1 shows the list of possible interpretations and Table 2 and 3 examples for each interpretation. The sources for the interpretations of the instrumental case have been a grammar of Basque (Euskaltzaindia, 1985) and a bilingual dictionary (Elhuyar, 1996). Possible interpretations for Spanish and English prepositions have been taken from an English dictionary (Cambridge, online), a Spanish dictionary (Vox, online) and a Spanish grammar (Bosque &amp; Demonte, 1999). For this work we have taken a descriptive approach, but other more theoretically committed approaches are also possible. The overall method is independent of the set of interpretations, as it only needs a table of possible interpretations in the style of Table 1. Section 5.4 further discusses other alternatives. In order to disambiguate the occurrences of the instrumental case suffix we have taken the Spanish and English translations for this case suffix. The list of possible translations is preliminary and covers what we found necessary to make this experiment. Table 1 shows the list of prepositions and interpretations for Spanish and English. Examples of the interpretations can be in Table 2. The Spanish preposition the same interpretations as the instrumental case suffix (cf. Table1), so it was discarded. The instrumental case occurs in 4,004 different in the The algorithm in Section 2 was applied to all these definitions, yielding a result for 125 triples, 3.1% of the total. The triples for which we had an answer were tagged by hand independently, i.e. not consulting the results output by the algorithm. The handtagged set constitutes what we call the gold standard. A single linguist made the tagging, consulting other teammates when in doubt. Apart from marking the interpretation, there were some other special cases. 1. In some of the examples, the instrumental case was part of a more complex scheme, and was tagged accordingly: Part of a postposition (XPOST), e.g. means of) or ordez of). Part of a conjunction (XLOK), e.g. Part of a compounded suffix (XZKO), which results from the of the instrumental location genitive 2. There were three errors in the lemmatization process (XLEM), due to lexicalized items, e.g. male person). 3. Finally, the relation in the definition was sometimes wrongly retrieved, e.g. • The triple would contain the determiner or an adjective instead of the dependencies. We thought that the algorithm would be able to work well even with those cases, so we decided to keep them. • The triple contains a conjunction (X) : these were tagged as incorrect. Table 4 shows the amount of such cases, alongside the frequency of each interpretation. most frequent interpretation is In seven examples, the linguist decided to keep two In a single example, the linguist was unable to select an interpretation, so this example was discarded. The output of the algorithm was compared with the gold standard, yielding the accuracy figures in Table 5. An output was considered correct if it yielded at least one interpretation in common with the gold standard. The accuracy is given for each dictionary in isolation, or merging all the results (as mentioned in section 2, when two dictionaries propose interpretations for the same triple, their intersection is taken). The remaining ambiguity is 3.1 overall.

Table 4 also shows the most frequent baseline (MF), constructed as follows: for each occurrence of the suffix, the three most frequent interpretations are chosen. The accuracy of this baseline is practically equal to that of the algorithm. Note that the frequency is computed on the same sample where it is applied, yielding better results than it should. The obtained results show a very good accuracy, leaving a remaining ambiguity of 3.1 results per example. This means that we were able to discard an average of 4 readings for each of the examples, introducing only 5.5% of error. The results are practically equal to the most frequent baseline, which is usually hard to beat using knowledgebased techniques. Coverage of the method is very low, only 2.3%, but this was not an issue for us, as we plan to couple this method with other Machine Learning techniques in a bootstrapping framework. Nevertheless, we are still interested in increasing the coverage, in order to obtain more training data. Next, we will analyze more in depth the causes of the low coverage, the sources of the errors and ambiguity and the interpretations of case suffixes and prepositions. 5.1 Sources of low coverage As soon as we started devising this method, it was clear to us that the coverage will be rather low. The main reason is that different dictionaries tend to give different details in their definitions, or use differing paraphrases. This fact is intrinsic to our method, and accounts for the large majority of missing answers. On the other hand, the simple method used to find triples means that a change in the order of the complements will cause our method to fail looking for a translation triple. Syntactic analysis, even shallow parsing methods, will help increase the coverage. Another source of discarded triples are the cases where the suffix is not translated by a preposition, e.g. the relation is carried out by a subject or direct object. When syntactic analysis is 8 XPOST 1 XLOK 12 XZKO 3 XLEM 9 X 1 No interpretation 34 Total discarded 37 instrument 35 containing 7 instrument manner 6 manner 5 theme 1 cause 0 matter 0 during-time 91 Total kept 4: of tags in gold standard.

Examples: xixta/prick: punta by needle luma/feedle: odi made by There errors could be avoided using a syntactic parser. Other wrong pairings were caused by errors in the English PoS tagger, or chance made the algorithm find an unrelated definition. 5.3 Remaining ambiguity The amount of readings left by our method in this experiment is rather high, around 3.1 readings compared to 7 possible readings for the instrumental. This is a strong reduction but we would like to make it even smaller. We plan to study which is the source of the residual ambiguity. Alternative sets of interpretations (cf. Section 5.4) with coarser grained differences and smaller ambiguity, could yield better results. Another alternative is to explore more infrequent translations of the case suffixes, which might yield a narrower overlap. This is the case for the instrumental case suffix translated with etc. 5.4 Interpretations of case suffixes and prepositions Different authors give differing interpretations for prepositions. It has been our choice to take a descriptive list of possible interpretations from a set of sources, mainly dictionaries and grammar books. This work covers only the instrumental case suffix and its translations to English and Spanish. If tables for all case suffixes and prepositions were built, the method could be applied to all case suffixes and prepositions, yielding disambiguated relations in all three languages. More theoretically committed lists of interpretations (Dorr et al., 1998; Civit et al., 2000; Sowa, 2000) should also be considered, but unfortunately we have not found a full account for all prepositions. If such a full table of interpretations existed, it could be very easy to apply our method, and obtain the outcome in terms of these other interpretations. and further work This paper presents preliminary experiments in the use of translation equivalences to disambiguate prepositions or case suffixes. The core of the method is to find translations of the occurrence of the target preposition or case suffix, and assign the intersection of their set of interpretations. The method is fully automatic, given a table with prepositions and their possible interpretations. We have tested this method on the occurrences the Basque instrumental case the definitions of a Basque dictionary. We have searched the translations in the definitions from 3 Spanish and 3 English dictionaries. The results have been that we are able to disambiguate with 94.5% accuracy 2.3% of those occurrences (up to 91). The ambiguity is reduced from 7 readings down to 3.1. We think that these are very good results, especially seeing that there is room for improvement. More specifically, we plan to apply surface syntactic analysis to better extract the dependency relations, which is the main source of errors. We would like to study other inventories of preposition interpretations, both in order to have better theoretical foundations as well as to investigate whether coarser grained distinctions would lead to a reduction in the ambiguity. In the future, we plan to explore the possibility to feed a Machine Learning algorithm with the automatically disambiguated examples, in order to construct a full-fledged disambiguation algorithm following a bootstrapping approach. On the other hand, we would like to apply the method to the set of all prepositions and case suffixes, and beyond that to all syntactic dependencies. The results will be directly loaded in a Lexical Knowledge Base extracted from the Basque dictionary (Ansa et al., in prep.). We also plan to explore whether this method can be applied to free running text, removing the constraint that the translations have to be definitions of the equivalent word. Finally, this technique could be coupled with techniques that make use of the semantic types of the words in the context. Overall, we found the results are very encouraging given the simple techniques used, and we think that it shows great potential for improvement and interesting avenues for research.</abstract>

Section 2 presents the method for disambiguation in detail. Section 3 introduces the interpretations for the case suffix and the prepositions. The results are shown in Section 4, which are further discussed in Section 5. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions and future work. 2 Method for disambiguation The goal of the method is to disambiguate between the possible interpretations of a case suffix appearing in any text. We have taken as the target text the definitions from a monolingual Basque dictionary Euskal Hiztegia, EH in short (Sarasola, 1996). The method consists on five steps: • Extraction of the definitions in EH where the target case suffix occurs. • Search of on-line Spanish and English dictionaries to obtain the translation equivalent of the definitions. • Extraction of the target preposition from the translation definitions. • Disambiguation based on the intersection of the interpretations of case suffix and prepositions. We will explain each step in turn. 2.1 Extraction of relations from EH Given a case suffix, in this step we will search the EH dictionary for occurrences of the case suffix.
