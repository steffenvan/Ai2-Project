This paper presents the current results of
an ongoing research project on corpus
distribution of prepositions and pronouns
within Polish preposition-pronoun con-
tractions. The goal of the project is to pro-
vide a quantitative description of Polish
preposition-pronoun contractions taking
into consideration morphosyntactic prop-
erties of their components. It is expected
that the results will provide a basis for a re-
vision of the traditionally assumed inflec-
tional paradigms of Polish pronouns and,
thus, for a possible remodeling of these
paradigms. The results of corpus-based in-
vestigations of the distribution of preposi-
tions within preposition-pronoun contrac-
tions can be used for grammar-theoretical
and lexicographic purposes.

As (´Swidzi´nski and Derwojedowa, 2004) and
(Trawi´nski, 2005) have observed, preposition-
pronoun contraction (PPC) in Polish (cf. (1)) is a
highly idiosyncratic phenomenon.
(1) a. na niego ‘on him’ na´n ‘on—him’
b. w niego ‘in him’ we´n ‘in—him’
On the one hand, not just any pronoun can occur
in a PPC, on the other hand, the set of prepositions
which are able to contract with pronouns involves
a very limited number of elements.1
The distribution of pronouns and prepositions
within Polish PPCs has not yet been discussed

in detail. There are, however, several traditional
approaches to Polish third person personal pro-
nouns (TPPPs) which provide some relevant infor-
mation.2 In the following, the approach to TPPPs
of (Saloni, 1981), adopted in our research project,
will be presented.
According to (Saloni, 1981), the inventory of
Polish TPPPs comprises masculine human, mas-
culine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine,
and neuter pronouns, inflecting for case (nomina-
tive, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental and
locative), number (singular and plural), postprepo-
sitionality (yes or no) and accentability (yes or no).
The inflectional paradigms of TPPPs proposed by
(Saloni, 1981), and adopted in most Polish gram-
mars, indicate that only genitive and accusative
masculine human, masculine animate and mascu-
line inanimate singular TPPPs possess unaccented
postprepositional realizations, i.e., are able to con-
tract with prepositions.3 However, corpus evi-
dence indicates that there may be many further
possibilities of the realization of unaccented post-
prepositional pronouns, i.e., pronouns contractible
with prepositions.
Corpus data also provide interesting informa-
tion about the distribution of prepositions within
PPCs. Only some PPCs found in the corpus cor-
respond with respect to the form of prepositions
contained in those PPCs, to dictionary data.
The goal of this research project is to character-
ize the corpus distribution of TPPPs and preposi-
tions occurring within PPCs and to quantitatively
analyze the results. While the first part of the

claim that unaccented postprepositional pronouns are possi-
ble only in the accusative.

For the corpus-based investigation of the distribu-
tion of pronouns and prepositions within Polish
PPCs, the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish was used.4
Because of their very low frequency, the PPCs
were searched for in the largest of the available IPI
PAN subcorpora, i.e., the automatically annotated
wstepny corpus (over 70 million segments).
PPCs had to be identified manually, as they
were not recognized in the wstepny corpus
as consisting of multiple segments, instead be-
ing identified as unknown forms (tagged by ign).
Thus, in the first instance, a search was performed
for all unknown forms ending in -(e)´n.5 Next,
a total of 1193 PPCs were manually extracted
from 3308 result matches. Later, an interpreta-
tion in terms of grammatical features was assigned
to each contracted pronoun by identifying its an-
tecedent. The antecedent identification proceeded
manually as well. Finally, the set of the acquired
PPCs was verified by querying the corpus for all
potential contractions of unaccented postpreposi-
tional pronouns with each particular Polish prepo-
sition.
As a result, genitive and accusative masculine
human plural, locative masculine inanimate sin-
gular, genitive and accusative masculine inani-
mate plural, genitive and accusative neuter singu-
lar, genitive, accusative and locative neuter plu-
ral, genitive and accusative feminine singular, and
genitive, accusative and locative feminine plural
pronominal forms within PPCs were recorded in
addition to the masculine human, masculine ani-
mate and masculine inanimate singular pronomi-

4The IPI PAN Corpus is a large (over 300 million seg-
ments), morphosyntactically annotated corpus of Polish, de-
veloped at the Institute of Computer Science at the Polish
Academy of Sciences (cf. (Przepiórkowski, 2004)). The cor-
pus web page is located at http://korpus.pl. For quan-
titative information about the corpus, see Przepiórkowski (to

alized by the syncretic form -(e)´n.

nal forms.
A further observation that was made on the
basis of corpus data was that the set of prepo-
sitions detected in contractions with unaccented
postprepositional pronouns involves a very lim-
ited number of elements, more precisely dla ‘for’,
do ‘to’, na ‘on’, od ‘from’, po ‘after’, przez
‘by’, w ‘in’, za ‘behind’, z ‘with’, and przed ‘in
front of’. No occurrences of contractions con-
taining other prepositions were found in the cor-
pus. While the absence of contractions involving
secondary prepositions, such as ponad ‘above’,
poprzez ‘through’, mi˛edzy ‘between’, etc. corre-
sponds to dictionary data, the non-appearance of
contractions containing prepositions such as bez
‘without’, o ‘about’, nad ‘above’, or pod ‘under’,
provided in Polish dictionaries such as (Dubisz,
2003) or (Banko, 2000), does not.6
Figure 1 on the next page presents an overview
of the distribution of all unaccented postprepo-
sitional pronouns and prepositions within PPCs
found in the IPI PAN Corpus. For each pronoun
form, the context in which it occurs is specified,
i.e., the contraction of that form with a particu-
lar preposition, and the total number of times this
form occurred together with the percentage of the
total frequency of all unaccented postprepositional
forms is recorded. In addition, the total of all oc-
currences of each contraction found in the corpus
is indicated, as well as the percentage of the total
frequency of all preposition-pronoun contractions
occurring in the corpus.7

To determine whether the distribution of the un-
accented postprepositional pronouns and prepo-
sitions within PPCs found in the IPI PAN Cor-
pus may be considered linguistically significant
and, in consequence, may establish the basis for
a revision of the traditionally assumed inflectional
paradigms, a number of quantitative procedures
must be performed.
First of all, it must be determined whether the
frequency of each unaccented postprepositional
6Note, however, that in spite of the fact that contractions
such as o´n ‘for_TPPP’ or we´n ‘in_TPPP are included in dic-
tionaries of contemporary Polish, these expressions are not
accepted by all native speakers of Polish.
7The specifications m1, m2 and m3 refer to masculine
human, masculine animate and masculine inanimate respec-
tively. The minus signs indicate the absence of particular
forms by means of the case government properties of the par-
ticular preposition.

pronoun form in the corpus is statistically signif-
icant. For this purpose, the distribution of all ac-
cented postprepositional pronouns must be com-
piled. On the basis of the total frequency of
accented and unaccented postprepositional pro-
nouns, the statistical significance can be calcu-
lated using the test, for instance. If one deter-
mines that the frequency of unaccented postprepo-
sitional pronouns in the corpus is statistically sig-
nificant, ratios of the total number of particular
accented postprepositional pronouns to the total
number of their unaccented counterparts can be as-
certained. These ratios can then be compared.8 If
the ratios of accented postprepositional pronouns
to their unaccented counterparts not included in
the traditionally assumed inflectional paradigms
correlate with the ratios of accented postpreposi-
tional pronouns to their unaccented counterparts
contained in the traditionally assumed inflectional
paradigms, the distribution of the unaccented post-
prepositional pronouns in the corpus may be con-
sidered linguistically important.
In our ongoing study, the distribution of
accented postprepositional pronouns combining
with the prepositions dla ‘for’, do ‘to’, na ‘on’,
w ‘in’, z ‘with’, od ‘from’, przez ‘by’, po ‘af-
ter’, za ‘behind’, and przed ‘in front of’ has
been ascertained. These pronouns correspond
to their unaccented counterparts occurring as
parts of the contractions dla´n ‘for_TPPP’, do´n
‘to_TPPP’, na´n ‘on_TPPP’, we´n ‘in_TPPP’, ze´n
‘with_TPPP’ / ‘from_TPPP’, ode´n ‘from_TPPP’,
przeze´n ‘by_TPPP’, po´n ‘after_TPPP’, za´n ‘be-
hind_TPPP’, and przede´n ‘in front of_TPPP respec-
tively. Note that assigning interpretations to pro-
nouns must proceed manually on the basis of their
antecedents, as a vast number of pronouns in the
IPI PAN Corpus are resolved incorrectly. Figure 2
on the next page provides the current results.9
8Alternatively, the percentage of occurrences of each un-
accented postprepositional pronoun of the total number of
occurrences of unaccented postprepositional pronouns and
the percentage of occurrences of each accented postprepositi-
nal pronoun of the total number of occurrences of accented
postprepositional pronouns can be ascertained and the results
compared.
9Note that in some cases, assigning an interpretation to a
given pronoun was impossible, which is indicated in Figure 2
by the question mark (?). In some cases, identification of an
antecedent was not possible, more than one antecedent can-
didate bearing different features came into question, or some
features provided by an antecedent and a given pronoun were
inconsistent with one another. In the majority of cases, mor-
phosyntactic features clashed with contextual / pragmatic /
natural features.
Currently, only the distributional characteri-
zation of genitive and accusative feminine sin-
gular postprepositional pronouns is available for
analysis. It has been ascertained that genitive
unaccented postprepositional feminine pronouns
are used significantly less frequently in the IPI
PAN Corpus than are genitive accented postprepo-
sitional feminine pronouns ( =101.76 (df=1),
p&lt;0.001), and accusative unaccented postprepo-
sitional feminine pronouns are used significantly
less frequently in the IPI PAN Corpus than are ac-
cusative accented postprepositional feminine pro-
nouns ( =36.95 (df=1), p&lt;0.001). The per-
centage of genitive unaccented postprepositional
feminine singular pronouns of the total of all
unaccented postprepositional pronouns amounted
to 2.06 , while the percentage of genitive ac-
cented postprepositional feminine singular pro-
nouns amounted to 11.41 . The percentage of
accusative unaccented postprepositional feminine
singular pronouns of the total of all unaccented
postprepositional pronouns was 1.59 , while the
percentage of accusative accented postpreposi-
tional feminine singular pronouns was 5.68 . The
ratios of the totals of genitive and accusative ac-
cented postprepositional feminine singular pro-
nouns to the totals of their unaccented counter-
parts are given in Figure 3. Additionally, Figure 3
provides the ratio of the total of all accented plu-
ral pronouns occurring in the contexts indicated
in Figure 2, to the total of the unaccented forms.
For the final conclusions, however, the distribution
patterns of particular plural pronouns must be de-
scribed.

cant differences between particular ratios, an at-
tempt will be made to ascertain possible reasons
for these differences (e.g., ungrammaticality, pro-
duction errors, meta data, etc.) and conclusions
will be made. If there are no significant differ-
ences between the particular ratios, it will be con-
cluded that the distribution patterns of pronouns
and prepositions within PPCs found in the corpus
are also linguistically significant and that the tradi-
tionally assumed inflectional paradigms of TPPPs,
as well as previous dictionary specifications of
PPCs, may have to be revised.

In this paper, the current results of our ongoing
corpus-based study on the distribution of preposi-
tions and pronouns within Polish PPCs were pre-
sented. At this point, conclusions can be drawn
that, according to corpus evidence, there seem to
exist more pronominal forms being able to con-
tract with prepositions than traditionally assumed.
On the other hand, corpus data provide fewer
prepositions contracting with pronouns than do
Polish dictionaries. To verify these results for the
purpose of a possible revision of the traditionally
assumed inflectional paradigms of TPPPs, as well
as for lexicographic purposes, a quantitative anal-
ysis was proposed which draws on the calculation
and comparison of ratios of the total frequency of
all accented postprepositional forms to the total
frequency of their unaccented counterparts. The
analysis will be completed within the next project
phase.
In future work, other corpora of Polish, such
as the PWN Corpus of Polish11 or the PELCRA
Corpus12 will be examined with respect to the
distribution of pronouns and prepositions within
PPCs, and the results will be compared with those
achieved using the IPI PAN Corpus.13 Further on,

<abstract confidence="0.99959152631579">This paper presents the current results of an ongoing research project on corpus distribution of prepositions and pronouns within Polish preposition-pronoun contractions. The goal of the project is to provide a quantitative description of Polish preposition-pronoun contractions taking into consideration morphosyntactic properties of their components. It is expected that the results will provide a basis for a revision of the traditionally assumed inflectional paradigms of Polish pronouns and, thus, for a possible remodeling of these paradigms. The results of corpus-based investigations of the distribution of prepositions within preposition-pronoun contractions can be used for grammar-theoretical and lexicographic purposes.</abstract>

There are, however, several traditional approaches to Polish third person personal pronouns (TPPPs) which provide some relevant information.2 In the following, the approach to TPPPs of (Saloni, 1981), adopted in our research project, will be presented. According to (Saloni, 1981), the inventory of Polish TPPPs comprises masculine human, masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter pronouns, inflecting for case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental and locative), number (singular and plural), postprepositionality (yes or no) and accentability (yes or no).
