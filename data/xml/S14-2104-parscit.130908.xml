In this paper, we present our contribution in
SemEval2014 ABSA task, some supervised
methods for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of
restaurant and laptop reviews are proposed, im-
plemented and evaluated. We focus on determin-
ing the aspect terms existing in each sentence,
finding out their polarities, detecting the catego-
ries of the sentence and the polarity of each cate-
gory. The evaluation results of our proposed
methods exhibit a significant improvement in
terms of accuracy and f-measure over all four
subtasks regarding to the baseline proposed by
SemEval organisers.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9994840625">
The increasing amount of user-generated textual
data has increased the need of efficient tech-
niques for analysing it. Sentiment Analysis (SA)
has become more and more interesting since the
year 2000 (Liu 2012), many techniques in Natu-
ral Language Processing have been used to un-
derstand the expressed sentiment on an entity.
Many levels of granularity have been also distin-
guished: Document Level SA considers the
whole document is about an entity and classifies
whether the expressed sentiment is positive, neg-
ative or neutral; Sentence Level SA determines
the sentiment of each sentence, some works have
been done on Clause Level SA but they are still
not enough; Entity or Aspect-Based SA performs
finer-grained analysis in which all entities and

their aspects should be extracted and the senti-
ment on them should also be determined.
Aspect-Based SA task consists of several sub-
problems, the document is about many entities
which could be for example a restaurant, a lap-
top, a printer. Users may refer to an entity by
different writings but normally there are not a lot
of variations to indicate the same entity, each
entity has many aspects which could be its parts
or attributes, some aspects could be another enti-
ty such as screen of laptop, but most works did
not take this case into account. Therefore, we
could define the opinion by the quintuple (Liu
2012) (ei, aij, sijkl, hk, tl) where ei is the entity i, aij
are the aspects of the entity i, sijkl is the ex-
pressed sentiment on the aspect at the time tl, hk
the holder which created the document or the
text.
This definition does not take into account that the
entity has aspects that could have also other as-
pects which leads to an aspect hierarchy, in order
to avoid this information loss, few works have
handled this issue, they proposed to represent the
aspect as a tree of aspect terms (Wei and Gulla
2010; Kim, Zhang et al. 2013).
Supervised and unsupervised methods have been
used for handling this task, in this paper, we pro-
pose supervised methods and test them over two
datasets related to laptop reviews and restaurant
reviews provided by the ABSA task of
SemEval2014 (Pontiki, Galanis et al. 2014). We
tackle four subtasks:

Several methods concerning the ABSA have
been proposed, some of them are supervised, and
others unsupervised. The earliest work on aspect
detection from on-line reviews presented by Hu
and Liu used association rule mining based on
Apriori algorithm to extract frequent noun
phrases as product features, they used two seed
sets of 30 positive and negative adjectives, then
WordNet has been used to find and add the seed
words synonyms. Infrequent aspects had been
processed by finding the noun related to an opin-
ionated word (Hu and Liu 2004).
Opinion Digger (Moghaddam and Ester 2010)
used also Apriori algorithm to extract the fre-
quent aspects then it filters the non-aspects by
applying a constraint -learned from the training
data- on the extracted aspects. KNN algorithm is
applied to estimate the aspect rating scaling from
1 to 5 stands for (Excellent, Good, Average,
Poor, Terrible), assuming that the sentiment is
expressed by the nearest adjectives to the aspect
term in the sentence segment, WordNet is used
for finding the synonyms of sentiment word in
order to use them to estimate the distance be-
tween it and the words of rating scale.
Some unsupervised methods based on LDA
(Latent Dirichlet allocation) were proposed.
Brody and Elhadad used LDA to find the as-
pects, determined the number of topics by apply-
ing a clustering method (Brody and Elhadad
2010), then they used a similar method proposed
by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997) to extract
the conjunctive adjectives but not the disjunctive
due to the specificity of the domain, seed sets
were used and assigned scores, these scores were
propagated using propagation method through
the aspect-sentiment graph building from the
pairs of aspect and related adjectives.
Other works make one LDA based model for
the aspect and sentiment extraction. Lin and He

(Lin and He 2009)proposed Joint model of Sen-
timent and Topic (JST) which extends the state-
of-the-art topic model, Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) by adding a sentiment layer, this
model is fully unsupervised and it can detect sen-
timent and topic simultaneously.
Wei and Gulla (Wei and Gulla 2010) modelled
the hierarchical relation between product aspects.
They defined SOT Sentiment Ontology Tree to
formulate the knowledge of hierarchical relation-
ships among product attributes and tackle the
problem of sentiment analysis as a hierarchical
classification problem. Unsupervised hierarchical
aspect
Sentiment model (HASM) was proposed by Kim
et al (Kim, Zhang et al. 2013) to discover a hier-
archical structure of aspect-based sentiments
from unlabelled online reviews.
Supervised methods uses normally a CRF or
HMM models. Jin and Ho (Jin and Ho 2009)
applied a lexicalized HMM model to extract as-
pects using the words and their part-of-speech
tags in order to learn a model, then unsupervised
algorithm for determining the aspect sentiment
using the nearest opinion word to the aspect and
taking into account the polarity reversal words
(such as not). CRF model was used by Jakob and
Gurevych (Jakob and Gurevych 2010) with these
features: tokens, POS tags, syntactic dependency
(if the aspect has a relation with the opinionated
word), word distance (the distance between the
word in the closest noun phrase and the opinion-
ated word), and opinion sentences (each token in
the sentence containing an opinionated expres-
sion is labelled by this feature), the input of this
method is also the opinionated expressions, they
use these expressions for predicting the aspect
sentiment using the dependency parsing for re-
trieving the pair aspect-expression from the train-
ing set.
Our method for aspect extraction is closed to
(Jakob and Gurevych 2010), where we used CRF
model with different features for aspect extrac-
tion, but another method for sentiment detection.
The second and fourth subtasks are concerning
the polarity detection, so besides to all previous
discussed works, we can handle them as sentence
level SA. We choose to use Multinomial Naive
Bayes with some features (POS, Z-score, pre-
polarity). The most related work is (Hamdan,
Béchet et al. 2013) where they used Naive Bays
with WordNet, DBpedia and SentiWordNet fea-
tures.

3 The System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.869985">
Our system is composed of four subtasks:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.910981">
3.1 Subtask1: Aspect Terms Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978014791666667">
The objective of this subtask is to extract all
aspect terms in the review sentence, aspect terms
could be a word or multiple words. For this pur-
pose we have used CRF (Conditional Random
Field) which have been used for information ex-
traction. We choose the IOB notation, therefore
we distinguish the terms at the Beginning, the
Inside and the Outside of aspect term expression.
Then, we propose 16 features, for each term we
extract the following features:
- Its root (Porter Stemmer);
- Its POS tag;
-The stemming roots for all three words before
and after the term;
-The POS tags for all three words before and
after the term;
- A feature indicates if the word starts with
capital letter;
-A feature indicates if the word is capitalised.
For example, for this review “But the staff was
so horrible to us.” Where staff is the aspect term,
the target of each word will be:
But:O the:O staff:B was:O so:O horrible:O to:O
us:O.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982185">
3.2 Subtask2: Aspect Term Polarity Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999765222222222">
This subtask can be seen as sentence level or
phrase level sentiment Analysis, the first step (1)
we should detect the context or the words related
to the aspect term, then to compute its polarity
according to these words. Dependency parsing
could be used to determine these words or simple
distance function. We extract the context of as-
pect term according to the syntax and other as-
pect terms. Therefore, the context is the term it-
self and all the surrounding terms enclosed be-
tween two separators (commas in general), if
another aspect is also enclosed by these separa-
tors we consider it as a separator instead of the
comma, and we do not take the terms after it or
before it (according to its direction to the aspect
term). If the sentence has only an aspect term the
separators will be the beginning and the end of
the sentence. For example, for this review “It
took half an hour to get our check, which was
perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!”
where we have two aspect terms drinks and
check, the context of check will be “It took half
an hour to get our check” and the context of
drinks will be “have drinks and talk!”. Another
example, ”All the money went into the interior
decoration, none of it went to the chefs.” The
context for interior decoration will be “All the
money went into the interior decoration” and the
context for chefs will be “none of it went to the
chefs”.
The second step (2) we should determine the
polarity, which could be positive, negative, neu-
tral or conflict. We propose to use Multinomial
Naive-Bayes for learning a classifier based on
different features:
- The terms in the sentence (term frequency);
- The POS features (the number of adjectives,
adverbs, verbs, nouns, connectors)
- The pre-polarity features (the number of pos-
itive and negative words in the sentence ex-
tracted from Subjectivity lexicon and Bing
Liu&apos;s Opinion Lexicon);
- Z-score features (the number of words which
have Z-score more than three in each senti-
ment class), Z_score is described in 3.3.

3.3 Subtask3: Category Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998017388888889">
Determining the categories of each sentence
can be seen as a multi-label classification prob-
lem at sentence level.
We propose to use Z-score which is capable of
distinguishing the importance of a term in a cate-
gory. The more the term is important in a catego-
ry the more its Z-score is high in this category
and low in other categories in which it is not im-
portant. Thus, we compute the Z-score for all
terms using the annotated data, then for each
given sentence, the sum of Z-score over each
category is computed if the Z-score of term in a
category is less than zero, we ignore it in this
category because it is not important, the sentence
will be attributed to the category having the
highest Z-score, if some categories have the
same Z-scores the sentence will be attributed to
the both. The algorithm steps:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9957698">
For each tem t in the sentence:
For each category c:
If z-score(t,c)&gt;0:
Z_sc[c]+= z-score(t,c)
Categories=max(Z_sc)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849">
We assume that the term frequency follows the
multinomial distribution. Thus, Z_score can be
seen as a standardization of the term frequency.
We compute Z score for each term ti in a class Cj
(tij) by calculating its term relative frequency tfrij
in a particular class Cj, as well as the mean

whole corpus multiplied by nj the number of
terms in the class Cj, and standard deviation (sdi)

Eq. (1,2)).

Z_score was exploited for SA by (Zubaryeva
and Savoy 2010), they choose a threshold (Z&gt;2)
for selecting the number of terms having Z_score
more than the threshold, then they used a logistic
regression for combining these scores. We use
Z_score as added features for multinomial Naive
Bayes classifier.

3.4 Subtask4: Category Polarity Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997714285714">
We have used Multinomial Naive-Bayes as in
the subtask2 step (2) with the same features, but
the different that we add also the name of the
category as a feature. Thus, for each sentence
having n category we add n examples to the
training set, the difference between them is the
feature of the category.

We have built a system for Aspect-Based Sen-
timent Analysis; we proposed different super-
vised methods for the four sub-tasks. Our results
are always above the baseline proposed by the
organiser of SemEval. We proposed to use CRF
for aspect term extraction, Z-score model for cat-
egory detection, Multinomial Naive-Bayes with
some new features for polarity detection. We
find that the use of Z-score is useful for the cate-
gory and polarity detection, we are going to test
it in another sentiment analysis tasks of another
domains.

We focus on determining the aspect terms existing in each sentence, finding out their polarities, detecting the categories of the sentence and the polarity of each category. The evaluation results of our proposed methods exhibit a significant improvement in terms of accuracy and f-measure over all four subtasks regarding to the baseline proposed by SemEval organisers. 1 Introduction The increasing amount of user-generated textual data has increased the need of efficient techniques for analysing it. Sentiment Analysis (SA) has become more and more interesting since the year 2000 (Liu 2012), many techniques in Natural Language Processing have been used to understand the expressed sentiment on an entity. Many levels of granularity have been also distinguished: Document Level SA considers the whole document is about an entity and classifies whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative or neutral; Sentence Level SA determines the sentiment of each sentence, some works have been done on Clause Level SA but they are still not enough; Entity or Aspect-Based SA performs finer-grained analysis in which all entities and This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution </context>

Aspect-Based SA task consists of several subproblems, the document is about many entities which could be for example a restaurant, a laptop, a printer. Users may refer to an entity by different writings but normally there are not a lot of variations to indicate the same entity, each entity has many aspects which could be its parts or attributes, some aspects could be another entity such as screen of laptop, but most works did not take this case into account. Therefore, we could define the opinion by the quintuple (Liu 2012) (ei, aij, sijkl, hk, tl) where ei is the entity i, aij are the aspects of the entity i, sijkl is the expressed sentiment on the aspect at the time tl, hk the holder which created the document or the text. This definition does not take into account that the entity has aspects that could have also other aspects which leads to an aspect hierarchy, in order to avoid this information loss, few works have handled this issue, they proposed to represent the aspect as a tree of aspect terms (Wei and Gulla 2010; Kim, Zhang et al. 2013).
