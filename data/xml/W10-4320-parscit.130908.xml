In this paper we examine the influence of
dimensionality on natural language route
directions in dialogue. Specifically, we
show that giving route instructions in a
quasi-3d environment leads to experiential
descriptive accounts, as manifested by a
higher proportion of location descriptions,
lack of chunking, use of 1st person singular
personal pronouns, and more frequent use of
temporal and spatial deictic terms. 2d scen-
arios lead to informative instructions, as
manifested by a frequent use of motion ex-
pressions, chunking of route elements, and
use of mainly 2nd person singular personal
pronouns.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919304347826">
In order to build artificial agents that are com-
petent in creating and understanding natural
language route directions in situated discourse,
it is necessary to explore how situatedness af-
fects the communication of humans about
routes. The current study aims at exploring in
which ways dimensionality influences the
choice of communicative strategies for route
directions in discourse.
Previous research about route directions
mostly deals with monologues or pretend dia-
logue (e.g. Rehrl et al., 2009; Klippel et al.,
2003), and concerns two-dimensional stimuli,
such as map-based tasks (Klippel et al., 2003;
Goschler et al., 2008).
The study presented here examines pairs of
participants collaborating on a route instruction
task in a naturalistic discourse setting under
two conditions: In the 2d condition, the in-
structor was shown a two-dimensional map
with the route drawn into it. In the 3d condition
however, the instructor navigated along a pre-
set route in Google Maps Street View.

2 Route Instruction Strategies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994375">
Route directions consist of procedures and de-
scriptions that combine to a step-by-step pre-
scription of the actions that are necessary for
executing the given course (Michon and Denis,
2001; Longacre, 1983). Since spatial linguistic
expressions reflect the mental model already
existing on the part of the instructor, the di-
mensions in which route instructors experience
an environment (2d or 3d) may have a system-
atic impact on the discourse strategies they use.
In the following we analyze a range of spatial
descriptions, focusing on aspects known to be
crucial for spatial interaction, such as descrip-
tions of locations and motion, the use of per-
spective expressions, chunking of route ele-
ments, and personal and spatiotemporal deixis.

2.1 Static and Dynamic Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805461538462">
Since route directions deal with a static envir-
onment in which a movement takes place, they
usually include a high proportion of dynamic
descriptions of actions (procedures in Michon
and Denis&apos; (2001) terms), and additional static
information about the surroundings (descrip-
tions). In our analysis, we distinguished speak-
ers’ utterances as motion descriptions if they
described or requested the literal motion of an
entity. In contrast, an utterance was marked as
location if it described a static spatial relation,
for example the position of the speaker or an
object at a certain point in time.

person traveling along the route, or the survey
perspective, where the description is based on
cardinal directions, or directions as they are
defined by the map as a whole (Taylor and
Tversky, 1996). Previous research has indic-
ated that perspective choice can be influenced
by the specific situation, and by the coordina-
tion between speakers in natural discourse
(Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Watson et al.,
2006). In the present study, we test the hypo-
thesis that navigating a route in a 3d perspect-
ive makes it more difficult for the instructor to
use the survey perspective, leading to a prefer-
ence for the route perspective. Further we as-
sume that the follower will adapt to the in-
structor’s perspective choice in terms of lan-
guage use.

2.3 Chunking of Route Segments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982388888889">
In a study examining online route descriptions
to an imaginary follower based on a two-di-
mensional map, Klippel et al. (2003) found
that participants tended to chunk decision
points without directional change together. For
example, a speaker could say “turn right at the
second intersection” instead of “Go straight on,
and then turn right”. This occurred even when
the route was shown as a moving dot on the
map. In our study, we address the question
whether this also holds for instructors with a
three-dimensional view. We expected a fre-
quent usage of chunking in the 2d condition, in
which the participants have access to compre-
hensive structural information, as opposed to a
higher degree of separate references in the 3d
condition, in which participants experience the
environment incrementally.

3 Experiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976063829787">
22 students (average age 25, 14 male and 8 fe-
male) volunteered to participate in the experi-
ment. They formed 11 pairs that each com-
pleted one test run and three permuted critical
trials. Instructor and follower were placed in
different rooms and interacted via telephone
software.
The four predetermined routes were identic-
al for all participants, and they differed mildly
in complexity, ranging from 9 to 14 decision
points. All routes were located in San Fran-
cisco and were specifically designed such that,
at most decision points, descriptions would be
unambiguous with respect to perspective use.
In the 2d condition (5 pairs), instructors
were given a map that showed mostly street
names and major landmarks such as parks,
schools, restaurants, etc., as they appear in the
standard Google Maps map view. The route
consisted of a marked starting and end point,
and was signaled by a thick blue line with ar-
rows indicating the direction. In the 3d condi-
tion (6 pairs), instructors interacted directly
with Google Street View which had a photo-
graphic quasi-3d view and allowed them to ob-
serve the surroundings as if navigating on the
roads, seeing a vast amount of details of the
environment. Street names were clearly read-
able as an overlay on top of the photographic
imagery. The route was indicated by fat blue
arrows that the instructors could click on, in
order to move in the given direction.
In both conditions, the followers were asked
to draw the route on a map that only contained
the starting point. The task instruction was the
same for both conditions, priming for proced-
ural discourse yet ambiguous with respect to
perspective use: “Now you have to tell your
partner where you are going. Please do this by
giving instructions via the microphone.” (trans-
lated from German). In the 3d condition in-
structors were informed that the follower had a
different view of the same surroundings.
Taken together this setup differs from pre-
vious studies in that it features unconstrained
spoken dialogue and is set in a realistic use-
case with a three-dimensional setting.

The participants in the 3d condition took signi-

Chunking of route elements did not occur at
all in the 3d condition. In the 2d condition
there were 29 intersections that were skipped
through chunking, as shown in line 2.3 in Fig-

Instructors in the 2d condition strongly pre-
ferred 2nd person singular pronouns, whereas
instructors in the 3d condition showed a prefer-
ence - though not as strong - for 1st person sin-
gular (see Figure 2). Instructors in the 3d con-
dition also used the German formal pronoun es
‘it’ more frequently than those in the 2d condi-
tion. This preference is usually displayed in ut-
terances noting the presence of landmarks in
the surroundings (e.g. “Da gibt es eine Hal-

Our comparison of route directions given while
perceiving an environment either as a 2d map
or in a 3d view revealed that dimensionality
has systematic consequences for discourse
strategies on various levels. Location descrip-
tions, route perspective expressions, 1st person
singular personal pronouns, impersonal es ‘it’,
as well as temporal and spatial deictic terms
occurred more frequently in the instructors’
discourse in the 3d condition than in the 2d
condition. Also, in the 3d condition, instructors
did not chunk route elements together. These
findings reflect the fact that the instructors

consistently chose a different discourse
strategy in this condition. Instead of producing
procedural step-by-step instructions, they gave
descriptions of the events happening to them
and accounts of their surroundings, whereas in-
structors in the 2d condition gave typical route
directions for their partner to follow.
There are three aspects that may be respons-
ible for the different discourse strategies. First,
it can be assumed that there is a habitual pref-
erence, due to the fact that people providing
route directions usually have a 2d representa-
tion available to them, or prior knowledge of
the relevant route, whereas someone navigat-
ing new surroundings would not normally be
expected to provide efficient procedural in-
structions. Second, the lack of structural in-
formation in the 3d condition makes it difficult
for instructors to describe the route from a sur-
vey perspective, or to deliver precise goal-ori-
ented instructions. Third, in the 3d condition,
progress for the instructor was slow - compar-
able to riding a bicycle along the route at mod-
erate speed - due to the technical properties of
Google Maps Street View This severed the ef-
fect of the inherent lack of structural informa-
tion, and most probably led the participants to
verbalize their progress more frequently than
necessary, in order to keep the conversation
flowing, instead of to waiting until they
reached a point where more efficient instruc-
tions would be possible. This factor is also re-
flected in the number of utterances per trial:
The higher number of utterances per trial in the
3d condition (see section 4) is at least partly a
result of the technical setup.
In the case of chunking, time does not seem
to be the only relevant factor. Klippel et al.
(2003) showed that in a 2d scenario in which
the route was only gradually revealed in the
form of a moving dot on a map, participants
still made use of chunking. It remains to be in-
vestigated whether the lack of chunking in the
present scenario occurred due to the differing
dimensionality, or resulted from the uncon-
strained real dialogue situation, in contrast to
the pretend-dialogue used in Klippel et al.
(2003).
Further research should differentiate the role
of time in the choice of strategy from the im-
pact of perspective. This requires experimental
setups that allow for the systematic variation of
the speed of the navigation, as well as for bet-
ter control of such factors as previous know-
ledge and information density on the route. It
would also be necessary to examine two fur-
ther conditions (instructor: 3d, follower: 2d
and instructor: 2d, follower: 3d).

It remains to be investigated whether the lack of chunking in the present scenario occurred due to the differing dimensionality, or resulted from the unconstrained real dialogue situation, in contrast to the pretend-dialogue used in Klippel et al. (2003). Further research should differentiate the role of time in the choice of strategy from the impact of perspective. This requires experimental setups that allow for the systematic variation o</context>

The current study aims at exploring in which ways dimensionality influences the choice of communicative strategies for route directions in discourse. Previous research about route directions mostly deals with monologues or pretend dialogue (e.g. Rehrl et al., 2009; Klippel et al., 2003), and concerns two-dimensional stimuli, such as map-based tasks (Klippel et al., 2003; Goschler et al., 2008). The study presented here examines pairs of participants collaborating on a route instruction task in a naturalistic discourse setting under two conditions: In the 2d condition, the instructor was shown a two-dimensional map with the route drawn into it. In the 3d condition however, the instructor navigated along a preset route in Google Maps Street View. 2 Route Instruction Strategies Route directions consist of procedures and descriptions that combine to a step</context>
