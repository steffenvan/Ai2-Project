There have been a number of workshops in recent years on collocations, terminology and named
entity recognition. However, multiword expressions (MWEs) that encompass all of these subtypes
remain a real challenge for natural language processing (NLP) despite several decades of research
effort. The aim of this SIGLEX workshop is to bring together NLP researchers working on all
areas of MWEs. The objectives are to summarise what has been achieved in the area, to establish
common themes between different approaches and to discuss future trends, with particular emphasis
on addressing the problems that MWEs pose for real-world NLP applications. We welcomed
submissions on all aspects of analysis, acquisition and treatment of these ‘words with spaces’ which
often require special semantic interpretation and may have peculiar syntactic behaviour.
We received 30 submissions (8 from Asia, 14 from Europe and 8 from the Americas), and
accepted 13 of them for presentation. Each submission was reviewed by three members of the
program committee, who not only judged each submission but also gave detailed comments to the
authors. The overall quality of submissions was high, making the final selection very difficult. The
papers in these proceedings are those which were finally selected for presentation. Many of the
papers deal with MWEs in general, rather than aiming at specific subtypes, with several papers
on detection and extraction using a variety of methods: one using semantics and the rest relying
on statistics and syntax. There are papers dealing with particular subtypes of MWEs, of which
three papers specifically target phrasal verbs. Some papers address compositionality and semantic
interpretation and a couple look at MWEs in the context of real applications, namely Question
Answering and Machine Translation. Apart from English, other languages are also investigated,
with proposals for both French and Japanese.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers. We also thank all the members of
the program committee for their time and effort in ensuring that the papers were fairly assessed.
