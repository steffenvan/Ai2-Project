<bodyText confidence="0.999657592592593">
This paper presents the construction of a
manually annotated Chinese shallow Treebank,
named PolyU Treebank. Different from
traditional Chinese Treebank based on full
parsing, the PolyU Treebank is based on
shallow parsing in which only partial syntactical
structures are annotated. This Treebank can be
used to support shallow parser training, testing
and other natural language applications.
Phrase-based Grammar, proposed by Peking
University, is used to guide the design and
implementation of the PolyU Treebank. The
design principles include good resource sharing,
low structural complexity, sufficient syntactic
information and large data scale. The design
issues, including corpus material preparation,
standard for word segmentation and POS
tagging, and the guideline for phrase bracketing
and annotation, are presented in this paper.
Well-designed workflow and effective
semiautomatic and automatic annotation
checking are used to ensure annotation accuracy
and consistency. Currently, the PolyU Treebank
has completed the annotation of a
1-million-word corpus. The evaluation shows
that the accuracy of annotation is higher than
98%.

A Treebank can be defined as a syntactically
processed corpus. It is a language resource
containing annotations of information at various
linguistic levels such as words, phrases, clauses and
sentences to form a ‘bank of linguistic trees’. There
are many Treebanks built for different languages
such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus 1993), ICE-GB
(Wallis 2003), and so on. The Penn Chinese
Treebank is an important resource (Xia et al. 2000;
Xue et al. 2002). Its annotation is based on
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).

The corpus of 100,000 Chinese words has been
manually annotated with a strict quality assurance
process. Another important work is the Sinica
Treebank at the Academic Sinica, Taiwan ( Chen et
al. 1999; Chen et al. 2003). Information-based Case
Grammar (ICG) was selected as the language
framework. A head-driven chart parser was
performed to do phrase bracketing and annotating.
Then, manual post-editing was conducted.
According to the report, The Sinica Treebank
contains 38,725 parsed trees with 329,532 words.
Most reported Chinese Treebanks, including the
two above, are based on full parsing which requires
complete syntactical analysis including determining
syntactic categories of words, locating chunks that
can be nested, finding relations between phrases and
resolving the attachment ambiguities. The output of
full parsing is a set of complete syntactic trees.
Automatic full parsing, however, is difficult to
achieve good performance. Shallow parsing (or
partial parsing) is usually defined as a parsing
process aiming to provide a limited amount of local
syntactic information such as non-recursive noun
phrases, V-O structures and S-V structures etc. Since
shallow parsing can recognize the backbone of a
sentence more effectively and accurately with lower
cost, people has in recent years started to work using
results from shallow parsing. A shallow parsed
Treebank can be used to extract information for
different applications especially for training shallow
parsers.
Different from full parsing, annotation to a
shallow Treebank is only targeted at certain local
structures in a sentence. The depth of “shallowness”
and the scope of annotation vary from different
reported work. Thus, two issues in shallow Treebank
annotation is (1) what information and (2) to what
depths the syntactic information should be annotated.
Generally speaking, the degree of “shallowness” and
the syntactical labeling are determined by the
requirement of the serving applications. The choice
of full parsing or shallow parsing is dependent on
the need of the application including resources and
the capability of system to be developed (Xia et al.
2000; Chen et al. 2000; Li et al. 2003). Currently,
there is no large-scale shallow annotated Treebank
available as a publicly resource for training and
testing.
In this paper, we present a manually annotated
shallow Treebank, called the PolyU Treebank. It is
targeted to contain 1-million-word contemporary
Chinese text. The whole work on the PolyU
Treebank follows the Phrase-based Grammar
proposed by Peking University (Yu et al. 1998). In
this language framework, a phrase, lead by a lexical
word(or sometimes called a content word) as a head,
is considered the basic syntactical unit in a Chinese
sentence. The building of the PolyU Treebank was
originally designed as training data for a shallow
parser used for Chinese collocation extraction. From
linguistics viewpoint, a collocation occurs only in
words within a phrase, or between the headwords of
related phrases (Zhang and Lin 1992). Therefore, the
use of syntactic information is naturally considered
an effective way to improve the performance of
collocation extraction systems. The typical problems
like doctor-nurse (Church and Hanks 1990) could be
avoided by using such information. When
employing syntactical information in collocation
extraction, we restrict ourselves to identify the stable
phrases in the sentences with certain levels of
nesting. Thus it has motivated us to produce a
shallow Treebank.
A natural way to obtain a shallow Treebank is
through extracting shallow structures from a fully
parsed Treebank. Unfortunately, all the available
fully parsed Treebank, such as the Penn Treebank
and the Sinica Treebank, are annotated using
different grammars than our chosen Phrase-based
Grammar. Also, the sizes of these Treebank are
much smaller in scale to be useful for training our
shallow parser.
This paper presents the most important design
issues of the PolyU Treebank and the quality control
mechanisms. The rest of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 introduces the overview and
design principles. Section 3 to Section5, present
the design issues on corpus material preparation, the
standard for word segmentation and POS tagging,
and the guideline for phrase bracketing and labeling,
respectively. Section 6 discusses the quality
assurance mechanisms including a carefully
designed workflow, parallel annotation, and
automatic and semi-automatic post-annotation
checking. Section 7 gives the current progress and
future work.

2 Overview and Design Principles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927897435898">
The objective of this project is to manually
construct a large shallow Treebank with high
accuracy and consistency.
The design principles of The PolyU Treebank are:
high resource sharing ability, low structural
complexity, sufficient syntactic information and
large data scale. First of all, the design and
construction of The PolyU Treebank aims to provide
as much a general purpose Treebank as possible so
that different applications can make use of it as a
NLP resource. With this objective, we chose to
follow the well-known Phrase-based Grammar as
the framework for annotation as this grammar is
widely accepted by Chinese language researchers,
and thus our work can be easily understood and
accepted.
Due to the lack of word delimitation in Chinese,
word segmentation must be performed before any
further syntactical annotation. High accuracy of
word segmentation is very important for this project.
In this project, we chose to use the segmented and
tagged corpus of People Daily annotated by the
Peking University. The annotated corpus contains
articles appeared in the People Daily Newspaper in
1998. The segmentation is based on the guidelines,
given in the Chinese national standard GB13715,
(Liu et al. 1993) and the POS tagging specification
was developed according to the ‘Grammatical
Knowledge-base of contemporary Chinese’.
According to the report from Peking University, the
accuracy of this annotated corpus in terms of
segmentation and POS tagging are 99.9% and 99.5%,
respectively (Yu et al. 2001). The use of such mature
and widely adopted resource can effectively reduce
our cost, ensure syntactical annotation quality. With
consistency in segmentation, POS, and syntactic
annotation, the resulting Treebank can be readily
shared by other researchers as a public resource.
The second design principle is low structural
complexity. That means, the annotation framework
should be clear and simple, and the labeled syntactic
and functional information should be commonly
used and accepted. Considering the characteristics of
shallow annotation, our project has focused on the
annotation of phrases and headwords while the
sentence level syntax are ignored.
Following the framework of Phrase-based
Grammar, a base-phrase is regarded as the smallest
unit where a base-phrase is defined as a ‘stable’ and
‘simple’ phrase without nesting components. Study
on Chinese syntactical analysis suggests that phrases
should be the fundamental unit instead of words in a
sentence. This is because, firstly, the usage of
Chinese words is very flexible. A word may have
different POS tags serving for different functions in
sentences. On the contrary, the use of Chinese
phrases is much more stable. That is, a phrase has
very limited functional use in a sentence. Secondly,
the construction rules of Chinese phrases are nearly
the same as that of Chinese sentences. Therefore, the
analysis of phrases can help identifying POS and
grammatical functions of words. Naturally, it should
be regarded as the basic syntactical unit. Usually, a
base-phrase is driven by a lexical word as its
headword. Examples of base-phrases include base
NP, base VP and so on, such as the sample shown
below.
Using base-phrases as the start point, nested levels
of phrases are then identified, until the maximum
phrases (will be defined later) are identified. Since
we do not intend to provide full parsing information,
there has to be a limit on the level of nesting. For
practical reasons, we choose to limit the nesting of
brackets to 3 levels. That means, the depth of our
shallow parsed Treebank will be limited to 3. This
restriction can limit the structural complexity to a
manageable level.
Our nested bracketing is not strictly bottom up.
That is we do not simply extend from base-phrase
and move up until the 3rd level. Instead, we first
identify the maximal-phrase which is used to
identify the backbone of the sentence. The
maximal-phrase provides the framework under
which the base-phrases of up to 2 levels can be
identified. The principles for the identification of
scope and depth of phrase bracketing are briefly
explained below and the operating procedure is
indicated by the given order in which these
principles are presented. More details is given in
Section 5.
Step 1: Annotation of maximal-phrase which is
the shortest word sequence of maximally
spanning non-overlapping edges which plays a
distinct semantic role of a predicate. A
maximal-phrase contains two or more lexical
words.
Step 2: Annotation of base-phrases within a
maximal-phrase. In case a base-phrase and a
maximal-phrase are identical and the
maximal-phrase is already bracketed in Step 1, no
bracketing is done in this step. For each identified
base-phrase, its headword will be marked.
Step 3: Annotation of next level of bracketing,
called mid-phrase which is expended from a
base-phrase. A mid-phrase is annotated only if it is
deemed necessary. The process starts from the
identified base-phrase. One more level of
syntactical structure is then bracketed if it exists
within the maximal-phrase.
The third design principle is to provide sufficient
syntactical information for natural language
application even though shallow annotation does not
necessarily contain complete syntactic information
at sentence level. Some past research in Chinese
shallow parsing were on single level base-phrases
only (Sun 2001). However, for certain applications,
such as for collocation extraction, identification of
base-phrases only are not very useful. In this project,
we have decided to annotate phrases within three
levels of nesting within a sentence. For each phrase,
a label is be given to indicate its syntactical
information, and an optional semantic or structural
label is given if applicable. Furthermore, the
headword of a base-phrase is annotated. We believe
these information are sufficient for many natural
language processing research work and it is also
manageable for this project within its working
schedule.
Fourthly, aiming to support practical language
processing, a reasonably large annotated Treebank is
expected. Studies on English have shown that
Treebank of word size 500K to 1M is reasonable for
syntactical structure analysis (Leech and Garside
1996). In consideration of the resources available
and the reference of studies on English, we have set
out our Treebank size to be one million words. We
hope such a reasonably large-scale data can
effectively support some language research, such as
collocation extraction.
We chose to use the XML format to record the
annotated data. Other information such as original
article related information (author, date, etc.),
annotator name, and other useful information are
also given through the meta-tags provided by XML.
All the meta-tags can be removed by a program to
recover the original data.
We have performed a small-scale experiment to
compare the annotation cost of shallow annotation
and full annotation (followed Penn Chinese
Treebank specification) on 500 Chinese sentences
by the same annotators. The time cost in shallow
annotation is only 25% of that for full annotation.
Meanwhile, due to the reduced structural complexity
in shallow annotation, the accuracy of first pass
shallow annotation is much higher than full
annotation.

3 Corpus Materials Preparation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951166666667">
The People Daily corpus, developed by PKU,
consists of more than 13k articles totaling 5M words.
As we need one million words for our Treebank, we
have selected articles covering different areas in
different time span to avoid duplications due to
short-lived events and news topics. Our selection
takes each day’s news as one single unit, and then
several distant dates are randomly selected among
the whole 182 days in the entire collection. We
have also decided to keep the original articles’
structures and topics indicators as they may be
useful for some applications.

Tagging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856166666667">
The articles selected from PKU corpus are already
segmented into words following the guidelines
given in GB13715. The annotated corpus has a basic
lexicon of over 60,000 words. We simply use this
segmentation without any change and the accuracy
is claimed to be 99.9%.
Each word in the PKU corpus is given a POS tag.
In this tagging scheme, a total of 43 POS tags are
listed (Yu et al. 2001). Our project takes the PKU
POS tags with only notational changes explained as
follows:
The morphemes tags including Ag (Adjectives
morphemes), Bg, Dg, Ng, Mg, Rg, Tg, Qg, and Ug
are re-labeled as lowercase letters, ag, bg, dg, ng, mg,
rg, tg, qg and ug, respectively. This modification is
to ensure consistent labeling in our system where the
lower cases are used to indicate word-level tags and
upper cases are used to indicate phrase-level labels.

5 Phrase Bracketing and Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953788461539">
Phrase bracketing and annotation is the core part
of this project. Not only all the original annotated
files are converted to XML files, results of our
annotations are also given in XML form. The meta
tags provided by XML are very helpful for further
processing and searching to the annotated text. .
Note that in our project, the basic phrasal analysis
looks at the context of a clause, not a sentence. Here,
the term clause refers the text string ended by some
punctuations including comma (,), semicolon (;),
colon (:), or period (.). Certain punctuation marks
such as ‘ ’, ‘&lt;’, and ’&gt;’ are not considered clause
separators. For example,
is considered having two clauses and thus will be
bracketed separately. It should be pointed out that he
set of Chinese punctuation marks are different from
that of English and their usage can also be different.
Therefore, an English sentence and their Chinese
translation may use different punctuation marks.
For example, the sentence
is the translation of the English ‘Tom, John, and
Jack go back to school together’ , which uses ‘ ’
rather than comma(,) to indicate parallel structures,
and is thus considered one clause.
Each clause will then be processed according to
the principles discussed in Section 2. The symbols
‘[’ and ‘]’ are used to indicate the left and right
boundaries of a phrase. The right bracket is
appended with syntactic labels as described in the
general form of [Phrase]SS-FF, where SS is a
mandatory syntactic label such as NP(noun phrase)
and AP(adjective phrase), and FF is an optional label
indicating internal structures and semantic functions
such as BL(parallel), SB(a noun is the object of verb
within a verb phrase). A total of 21 SS labels and
20 FF labels are given in our phrase annotation
specification. For example, the functional label BL
identifies parallel components in a phrase as
indicated in the example .
As in another example shown below,
is a verb phrase, thus it is
labeled as VP. Furthermore, the verb phrase can be
further classified as a verb-complement type. Thus
an additional SBU function label is marked. We
should point out that since the FF labels are not
syntactical information and are thus not expected to
be used by any shallow parsers. The FF labels carry
structural and/or semantic information which are of
help in annotation. We consider it useful for other
applications and thus decide to keep them in the
Treebank. Appendix 1 lists all the FF labels used in
the annotation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998857">
5.1 Identification of Maximal-phrase:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94767612">
The maximal-phrases are the main syntactical
structures including subject, predicate, and objects in
a clause. Again, maximal-phrase is defined as the
phrase with the maximum spanning non-overlapping
length, and it is a predicate playing a distinct
semantic role and containing more than one lexical
word. That means a maximal-phrase contains at least
one base-phrase. As this is the first stage in the
bracketing process, no nesting should occur. In the
following annotated sentence,
(Eg.1)
there are two separate maximal-phrases,
, and
. Note
that is considered a base-phrase, but not a
maximal-phrase because it contains only one lexical
word. Unlike many annotations where the object of
a sentence is included as a part of the verb phrase,
we treat them as separate maximal-phrases both due
to our requirement and also for reducing nesting.
If a clause is completely embedded in a larger
clause, it is considered a special clause and given a
special name called an internal clause . We will
bracket such an internal clause as a maximal phrase
with the tag ‘IC’ as shown in the following example,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999613">
5.2 Annotation of Base-phrases:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998510333333333">
A base-phrase is the phrase with stable, close and
simple structure without nesting components.
Normally a base-phrase contains a lexical word as
the phrase
headword. Taking the maximal-phrase
in
Eg.1 as an example, and
, are base-phrases in this
maximal-phrase. Thus, the sentence is annotated as
base-phrases. is not bracketed because it is a
single lexical word as a base-phrase without any
ambiguity and it is thus by default not being
bracketed. is not further
bracketed because it overlaps with a maximal-phrase.
Our annotation principle here is that if a base-phrase
overlaps with a maximal-phrase, it will not be
bracketed twice.
The identification of base-phrase is done only
within an already identified maximal-phrase. In
other words, if a base-phrase is identified, it must be
nested inside a maximal-phrase or at most overlaps
with it. It should be pointed out that the
identification of a base-phrase is the most
fundamental and most important goal of Treebank
annotation. The identification of maximal-phrases
can be considered as parsing a clause using a
top-down approach. On the other hand, the
identification of a base-phrase is a bottom up
approach to find the most basic units within a
maximal-phrase.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994262">
5.3 Mid-Phrase Identification:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995884">
Due to the fact that sometimes there may be more
syntactic structures between the base-phrases and
maximal-phrases, this step uses base-phrase as the
starting point to further identify one more level of
the syntactical structure in a maximal-phrase. Takes
Eg.1 as an example, it is further annotated as
where the underlined text shows the additional
annotation.
As we only limit our nesting to three levels, any
further nested phrases will be ignored. The
following sentence shows the result of our
annotation with three levels of nesting:
However, a full annotation should have 4 levels of
nesting as shown below. The underlined text is the
4th level annotation skipped by our system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999082">
5.4 Annotation of Headword
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9962404">
In our system, a ‘#’ tag will be appended after a
word to indicate that it is a headword of the
base-phrase. Here, a headword must be a lexical
word rather than a function word.
In most cases, a headword stays in a fixed position
of a base-phrase. For example, the headword of a
noun phrase is normally the last noun in this phrase.
Thus, we call this position the default position. If a
headword is in the default position, annotation is not
needed. Otherwise, a ‘#’ tag is used to indicate the
headword.
For example, in a clause,
,
is a verb phrase, and the headword
of the phrase is , which is not in the default
position of a verb phrase. Thus, this phrase is further
annotated as:
Note that is also a headword, but since it
is in the default position, no explicit annotation is
needed.

6 Annotation and Quality Assurance
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886960000001">
Our research team is formed by four people at the
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, two linguists
from Beijing Language and Culture University and
some research collaborators from Peking University.
Furthermore, the annotation work has been
conducted by four post-graduate students in
language studies and computational linguistics from
the Beijing Language and Culture University.
The annotation work is conducted in 5 separate
stages to ensure quality output of the annotation
work. The preparation of annotation specification
and corpus selection was done in the first stage.
Researchers in Hong Kong invited two linguists
from China to come to Hong Kong to prepare for the
corpus collection and selection work. A thorough
study on the reported work in this area was
conducted. After the project scope was defined, the
SS labels and the FF labels were then defined. A
Treebank specification was then documented. The
Treebank was given the name PolyU Treebank to
indicate that it is produced at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University. In order to validate the
specifications drafted, all the six members first
manually annotated 10k-word material, separately.
The outputs were then compared, and the problems
and ambiguities occurred were discussed and
consolidated and named Version 1.0. Stage 1 took
about 5 months to complete. Details of the
specification can be downloaded from the project
website www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cclab.
In Stage 2, the annotators in Beijing were then
involved. They had to first study the specification
and understand the requirement of the annotation.
Then, the annotators under the supervision of a team
member in Stage 1 annotated 20k-word materials
together and discussed the problems occurred.
In fact, and are also
During this two-month work, the annotators were
trained to understand the specification. The
emphasis at this stage was to train the annotators’
good understanding of the specification as well as
consistency by each annotator and consistency by
different annotators. Further problems occurred in
the actual annotation practice were then solved and
the specification was also further refined or
modified.
In Stage 3, which took about 2 months, each
annotator was assigned 40k-word material each in
which 5k-words material were duplicate annotated
to all the annotators. Meanwhile, the team members
in Hong Kong also developed a post-annotation
checking tool to verify the annotation format, phrase
bracketing, annotation tags, and phrase marks to
remove ambiguities and mistakes. Furthermore, an
evaluation tool was built to check the consistency of
annotation output. The detected annotation errors
were then sent back to the annotators for discussion
and correction. Any further problems occurred were
submitted for group discussion and minor
modification on the specification was also done.
In stage 4, each annotator was dispatched with one
set of 50k-word material each time. For each
distribution, 15k-word data in each set were
distributed to more than two annotators in duplicates
so that for any three annotators, there would be 5K
duplicated materials. When the annotators finished
the first pass annotation, we used the post-annotation
checking tool to do format checking in order to
remove the obvious annotation errors such as wrong
tag annotation and cross bracketing. However, it was
quite difficult to check the difference in annotation
due to different interpretation of a sentence. What
we did was to make use of the annotations done on
the duplicate materials to compare for consistency.
When ambiguity or differences were identified,
discussions were conducted and a result used by the
majority would be chosen as the accepted result. The
re-annotated results were regarded as the Golden
Standard to evaluate the accuracy of annotation and
consistency between different annotators. The
annotators were required to study this Golden
Standard and go back to remove similar mistakes.
The annotated 50k data was accepted only after this.
Then, a new 50k-word materials was distributed and
repeated in the same way. During this stage, the
ambiguous and out-of-tag-set phrase structures were
marked as OT for further process. The annotation
specification was not modified in order to avoid
frequent revisit to already annotated data. About 4
months were spent on this stage.
In Stage 5, all the members and annotators were
grouped and discuss the OT cases. Some typical new
phrase structure and function types were appended
in the specification and thus the final formal
annotation specification was established. Using this
final specification, the annotators had to go back to
check their output, modify the mistakes and
substitute the OT tags by the agreed tags. Currently,
the project was already in Stage 5 with 2 months of
work finished. A further 2 months was expected to
complete this work.
Since it is impossible to do all the checking and
analysis manually, a series of checking and
evaluating tools are established. One of the tools is
to check the consistency between text corpus files
and annotated XML files including checking the
XML format, the filled XML header, and whether
the original txt material is being altered by accident.
This program ensures that the XML header
information is correctly filled and during annotation
process, no additional mistakes are introduced due to
typing errors.
Furthermore, we have developed and trained a
shallow parser using the Golden Standard data. This
shallow parser is performed on the original text data,
and its output and manually annotated result are
compared for verification to further remove errors
Now, we are in the process of developing an
effective analyzer to evaluate the accuracy and
consistency for the whole annotated corpus. For the
exactly matched bracketed phrases, we check
whether the same phrase labels are given. Abnormal
cases will be manually checked and confirmed. Our
final goal is to ensure the bracketing can reach 99%
accuracy and consistency.

For the material annotated by multiple annotators
as duplicates, the evaluation program has reported
that the accuracy of phrase annotation is higher than
99.5% and the consistency between different
annotators is higher than 99.8%. As for other
annotated materials, the quality evaluation program
preliminarily reports the accuracy of phrase
annotation is higher than 98%. Further checking and
evaluation work are ongoing to ensure the final
overall accuracy achieves 99%.
Up to now, the FF labels of 5,255 phrases are
annotated as OT. That means about 1.8% (5,255 out
of a total of 284,665) of them do not fit into any
patterns listed in Table 2. Most of them are proper
noun phrase, syntactically labeled as PP. We are
investigating these cases and trying to identify
whether some of them can be in new function and
structure patterns and give a new label.
It is also our intention to further develop our tools
to improve the automatic annotation analysis and
evaluation program to find out the potential
annotation error and inconsistency. Other
visualization tools are also being developed to
support keyword searching, context indexing, and
annotation case searching. Once we complete Stage
5, we intend to make the PolyU Treebank data
available for public access. Furthermore, we are
developing a shallow parser and using The PolyU
Treebank as training and testing data.

<abstract confidence="0.993039285714286">This paper presents the construction of a manually annotated Chinese shallow Treebank, Treebank. from traditional Chinese Treebank based on full parsing, the PolyU Treebank is based on shallow parsing in which only partial syntactical structures are annotated. This Treebank can be used to support shallow parser training, testing and other natural language applications. Phrase-based Grammar, proposed by Peking University, is used to guide the design and implementation of the PolyU Treebank. The design principles include good resource sharing, low structural complexity, sufficient syntactic information and large data scale. The design issues, including corpus material preparation, standard for word segmentation and POS tagging, and the guideline for phrase bracketing and annotation, are presented in this paper. Well-designed workflow and effective semiautomatic and automatic annotation checking are used to ensure annotation accuracy and consistency. Currently, the PolyU Treebank has completed the annotation of a 1-million-word corpus. The evaluation shows that the accuracy of annotation is higher than 98%.</abstract>

The depth of “shallowness” and the scope of annotation vary from different reported work. Thus, two issues in shallow Treebank annotation is (1) what information and (2) to what depths the syntactic information should be annotated. Generally speaking, the degree of “shallowness” and the syntactical labeling are determined by the requirement of the serving applications. The choice of full parsing or shallow parsing is dependent on the need of the application including resources and the capability of system to be developed (Xia et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2000; Li et al. 2003). Currently, there is no large-scale shallow annotated Treebank available as a publicly resource for training and testing. In this paper, we present a manually annotated shallow Treebank, called the PolyU Treebank. It is targeted to contain 1-million-word contemporary Chinese text. The whole work on the PolyU Treebank follows the Phrase-based Grammar proposed by Peking University (Yu et al. 1998). In this language framework, a phrase, lead by a lexical word(or sometimes called a content word) as a head, is considered the basic syntactical unit in a Chinese sentence.

We believe these information are sufficient for many natural language processing research work and it is also manageable for this project within its working schedule. Fourthly, aiming to support practical language processing, a reasonably large annotated Treebank is expected. Studies on English have shown that Treebank of word size 500K to 1M is reasonable for syntactical structure analysis (Leech and Garside 1996). In consideration of the resources available and the reference of studies on English, we have set out our Treebank size to be one million words. We hope such a reasonably large-scale data can effectively support some language research, such as collocation extraction. We chose to use the XML format to record the annotated data. Other information such as original article related information (author, date, etc.), annotator name, and other useful information are also given through the meta-tags provided by XML. All the meta-tags can be removed by a program to recover the original data. We have pe</context>

A mid-phrase is annotated only if it is deemed necessary. The process starts from the identified base-phrase. One more level of syntactical structure is then bracketed if it exists within the maximal-phrase. The third design principle is to provide sufficient syntactical information for natural language application even though shallow annotation does not necessarily contain complete syntactic information at sentence level. Some past research in Chinese shallow parsing were on single level base-phrases only (Sun 2001). However, for certain applications, such as for collocation extraction, identification of base-phrases only are not very useful. In this project, we have decided to annotate phrases within three levels of nesting within a sentence. For each phrase, a label is be given to indicate its syntactical information, and an optional semantic or structural label is given if applicable. Furthermore, the headword of a base-phrase is annotated.

The building of the PolyU Treebank was originally designed as training data for a shallow parser used for Chinese collocation extraction. From linguistics viewpoint, a collocation occurs only in words within a phrase, or between the headwords of related phrases (Zhang and Lin 1992). Therefore, the use of syntactic information is naturally considered an effective way to improve the performance of collocation extraction systems. The typical problems like doctor-nurse (Church and Hanks 1990) could be avoided by using such information. When employing syntactical information in collocation extraction, we restrict ourselves to identify the stable phrases in the sentences with certain levels of nesting. Thus it has motivated us to produce a shallow Treebank. A natural way to obtain a shallow Treebank is through extracting shallow structures from a fully parsed Treebank. Unfortunately, all the available fully parsed Treebank, such as the Penn Treebank and the Sinica Treebank, are annotated using different grammars than our chosen Phrase-based Grammar.
