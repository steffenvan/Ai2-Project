In this paper, we look into extending stan-

We developed a dialogue move taxonomy&apos; based on
a preliminary analysis of our empirical data on tu-
toring elementary set theory in German (Wolska et
al., 2004). The taxonomy draws on DAMSL (Allen
and Core, 1997), which is an attempt to provide
a standard top-level structure for annotating dia-
logues aiming at enhancing reusability of annotation
schemes. We make use of the DAMSL multiple-level
structure, which allows catering for the various func-
tions an utterance may have in dialogue.
We modified and extended the dialogue moves in
DAMSL with moves from the BE&amp;E (Basic Elec-
tricity &amp; Electronics) annotation scheme (Core et
al., 2002), which was developed for the tutorial dia-
logue genre. The BE&amp;E annotation scheme is based
on DAMSL, however without distinguishing all levels
that DAMSL provides for. It, furthermore, provides
additional dialogue moves, derived from a tutorial
dialogue corpus. We adopt some of these moves, but
in order to cater for more tutorial dialogue genre spe-
cific and domain specific phenomena, we define new
dialogue moves and group them in a separate task
level, following DAMSL. The need for such separa-
tion in dialogue systems has been also advocated by

2 General Description of the
Taxonomy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998335">
Our taxonomy features six dimensions, one for ev-
ery different function that an utterance might have
at the same time. The actual detailed descrip-
tion of what the utterance does in the dialogue at
hand corresponds to one of the categories of dia-
logue moves defined in the dimensions themselves.
In every dimension, there are different levels of de-
scription of the dialogue moves. These are structured
in classes and subclasses, up to three different levels
deep. The current function of an utterance is rep-
resented on the deepest level of subclasses, which
inherit the properties of the respective super-classes.
The six dimensions in the taxonomy are: 1) Forward
Looking, 2) Backward Looking, 3) Task, 4) Conven-
tional task-management, 5) Conventional dialogue-
management, and 6) Communicative status.

3 Task Dimension Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966170731707">
Extending DAMSL, we propose an expanded task
dimension for our multi-dimensional dialogue move
taxonomy. We define dialogue moves in it in a top-
down manner using empirical data that we have col-
lected (cf. (Wolska et al., 2004)). We are additionally
guided by tutorial dialogue specific moves defined in
(Core et al., 2002), as well as by psychological consid-
erations regarding teaching (Wilson and Cole, 1996;
Lim and Moore, 2002; Weiner, 1992). We claim that
adding the task dimension helps separating generic
dialogue management, on the one hand, and manip-
ulating genre and domain specific phenomena, in-
volved in modelling different teaching models and
domains, on the other hand. The latter we view as
only a sub-part of the dialogue manager.
More specifically the expanded task dimension al-
lows clearly separating out and defining the genre
and domain specific characteristics of dialogue,
which further facilitates the original idea of the
DAMSL attempt for reusability and reconfigurabil-
ity. That is, it provides a better framework for cap-
turing what is generic in dialogue management and,
hence, reusable between genres, and, contrary, what
is specific to the genre or even the different domains.
The latter also makes modelling the genre, and the
different domains in it, more straight forward, pro-
viding guidelines for what needs to be considered.
In such a framework, tutorial systems can make
use of the advantages of natural language capabilities
in tutoring, which have been discussed in (Moore,
1993), independently from their preferred teaching
strategies. Teaching models which presuppose dia-
logue interaction have already been demonstrated to
be a beneficial ingredient of tutoring (Chi et al., 1994;
Rosé et al., 2001). Additionally, however, the mod-
elling of such dialogue based teaching strategies can
manipulate psychological aspects of learning, such
as help the student build a deeper understanding of
the domain, eliminate cognitive load, and promote
schema acquisition (Wilson and Cole, 1996; Lim and
Moore, 2002).

3.1 Task Dimension Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913608695652">
In order to effect the above mentioned aims, we
define a task dimension, which captures functions
that are particular to the task at hand and its ma-
nipulation, and hence to the genre. It comprises
mostly newly defined moves. These moves require
special treatment in the tutorial genre or acquire
their specific function only due to the genre. They
can also only be planned by use of special modules
that deal with domain knowledge (cf. (Benzmuller
et al., 2003)) or after consulting information on the
current student progress. Moves in this dimension
are also quite often indirect ones.
The task dimension is divided into two sub-
dimensions in order to distinguish between the
two parallel tasks that are performed while tutor-
ing, namely the proof task and tutoring task. In
the proof task we define the dialogue move do-
main_contribution, which is concerned with resolving
the domain task for the session. In our domain the
task is finding a mathematical proof to a problem.
Example (1) is a domain_contribution, where the stu-
dent tries to perform a step in the proof which they
are expected to complete.

(1) S: K((a u B) n (C U D)) = K(a u B) u K (C u D)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9949678">
The dialogue moves in the tutoring task sub-
dimension are: Hint, domain_contribution_ evalua-
tion (comprises teaching model specific sub-classes),
check_origin_of_problem, request_evaluation, resign,
prompt, encourage, request assistance, and align.
These moves pertain to the tutoring, as they do not
try to resolve the task directly, but rather aim at
helping the student resolve it. This sub-dimension
constitutes the framework for manipulating different
teaching strategies.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999599">
3.2 Task Dimension Use
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989132">
The careful expansion of the task dimension can
prove extremely beneficial in a difficult genre as tu-
torial dialogues. The task level moves can be more
clearly defined for use in tutorial dialogues. Such
definitions facilitate our understanding of the phe-
nomena in tutorial dialogues and their implementa-
tion separately from the general dialogue manage-
ment moves, and in parallel to them.
Let us have a closer look into how the clear separa-
tion of the task level has allowed us the formalisation
of specific tutorial phenomena.
Before any reasonable feedback can be given to the
student, the student&apos;s input needs to be evaluated.
There are, however, two categories of student input
that are relevant to tutoring. There is input that
does not contribute to the task but carries tutoring
relevant information, such as motivation levels. This
aspect of the input is useful for the genre irrespective
of the teaching model implemented. For example, it
is useful to represent the move resign, i.e., the stu-
dent stating that they do not wish to continue with
the task. The way this move will be treated, can be
decided according to the pedagogical model of choice.
Resign is realised, for instance, by the utterance in
Example (2).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.62649">
(2) S3: Gebe auf.
&apos;I give up.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982613636364">
On the other hand, there is task related input
with which the student tries specifically to handle
the task, one way or another. It is characteristic of
this kind of input that it is, first, domain specific and,
second, that it needs to be evaluated with respect to
its success in bringing the task forward. Again the
specific way in which the evaluation will take place is
up to the implementor and dependent on the teach-
ing model assumed and the domain. Nonetheless,
the task dimension expansion which we are propos-
ing and the dialogue moves which we define in it
provide a framework and point to a possible way for
the further formalisation. More specifically, the di-
alogue move domain_contribution must be available
in order to represent an attempt to bring the task
forward. Once this is represented, it is up to the im-
plementor to decide on categories for the evaluation
of this attempt, that is the domain_contributions rel-
evant to the tutoring purposes. This decision is both
domain dependent (different domains might require
divergent evaluation methods) and teaching strat-
egy dependent (the information useful for tutoring
may vary between models). Hence, it lies beyond
the scope of dialogue management. We are currently
formalising such categories and incorporating them
in feedback managing algorithms, either as domain
specific or not, where possible (Tsovaltzi and Fiedler,
2003). These algorithms are external resources for
the dialogue manager.
Yet a third dialogue move related to the previous
two, is the move domain_contribution_evaluation.
This super-class comprises dialogue moves which sig-
nal the domain evaluation of domain_contributions,
and correspond to the above mentioned evaluation
categories. The managing of such dialogue moves,
e.g. generating them or not, and the tutoring situ-
ations which determine such manipulation decisions
are very relevant for pedagogical reasons and differ
for various teaching models. The need for represent-
ing them is , however, common in the genre of tuto-
rial dialogues. The utterance in Example (3) has a
signahirrelevant function at task level, while &apos;irrele-
vant&apos; constitutes an interesting domain_contribution
category in the proving domain.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7454135">
(3) Das ist zwar richtig, aber im Augenblick uninteres-
sant.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99144344">
&apos;That is correct, but at the moment not interesting.&apos;
We have further been able to better formalise the
task dimension move hint, which bares a particular
importance for the socratic teaching method that we
are modelling. More specifically, we were able to for-
malise the very complicated socratic tutoring strat-
egy, which is most appropriate for tutoring proving,
and with it the hinting process that implements it
and focuses on eliciting information and active learn-
ing (Fiedler and Tsovaltzi, 2003). Thus, we defined
hint categories in a hint taxonomy based on the needs
in the domain. Our hint taxonomy captures the un-
derlying function of hints. The latter is mainly re-
sponsible for the educational effect of hints. The
structure of the hint taxonomy also reflects the func-
tion of the hints with respect to the domain informa-
tion that the hint addresses or is meant to trigger.
In order to capture the different underlying func-
tions of a hint in our hint taxonomy we have defined
hint categories across different dimensions. The same
underlying function can be common for different sur-
face realisations. Part of the surface realisation is
captured by the forward and backward-looking di-
mensions and the direct dialogue moves represented
there. In other words, the hint categories are defined
in a taxonomy within the top level dialogue move
taxonomy. This makes it possible to investigate the
underlying function of hints, which is itself a very
complicated issue, separately from their surface real-
isation, whose function can be captured in the spirit
of the more standard dialogue moves. Example (4)
is a hint in the task dimension and it realises a pas-
sive relevant-concept hint function, based on our hint
taxonomy and according to the needs as they arise
from the the current student level. The particular
realisation is an open_option in the forward-looking
dimension. Given a different dialogue context, how-
ever, the same underlying hint function could just
as well be an action_directive without altering the
hint function at the cognitive level, but serving the
dialogue context better. This approach is contrary
to what has been done before in modelling tutorial
dialogues, which do not distinguish between the cog-
nitive and dialogue function of hints and have, thus,
provided no clear account of the status of hints in
the proposed dialogue move taxonomies (Person and
Graesser, 2003; Core et al., 2002). The hint cate-
gories in the hint taxonomy constitute output of a
hinting algorithm which is called upon by the dia-
logue manager (Fiedler and Tsovaltzi, 2003).

<bodyText confidence="0.996078612244898">
&apos;First you have to consider the if-then-relation.&apos;
As mentioned before, another advantage of the ex-
pansion of the task dimension which we are propos-
ing is that it facilitates reusability and easy recon-
figurability. The latter is a counter effect of the ro-
bust definitions of the functions at that level. This
makes it possible to define the manipulation of the
information captured at the task level for serving the
purposes of any teaching model preferred. At the
same time the definition of the task level function
as separate from the function at the most standard
forward and backward-looking levels clarifies exactly
what needs to be manipulated for the tutoring and
task (domain) purposes, as opposed to what can be
reused intact since it pertains to the general dialogue
management attributes. The required manipulation
of the latter is not expected to differ between genres.
Clear distinctions with regard to dialogue move
functions, as we have deliberated, offers itself as a
valuable basis for specifying interfaces between the
dialogue manager and other modules in a system.
Examples of such modules in our genre may be a task
manager, the pedagogical knowledge, the teaching
model, a user model (cf. (Benzmiiller et al., 2003)).
For example, the recognition of the student input
that constitutes a domain_contribution at the task
level, that is it tries to advance the task, also means
that it must be evaluated for the domain knowledge
that it demonstrates. Thus, it has to be sent to the
task manager and the evaluation module. On the
contrary, other kinds of student input do not need
to involve the task manager for their manipulation.
Early realisation of this fact allows valuable speed.
In terms of the inter-relations between this dimen-
sion and moves in other dimensions, it allows us to
capture the special status that moves have for the
tutorial dialogue genre, which are commonly indirect
speech acts, highly unlikely to serve the same pur-
pose in other genres. We can, for instance, recognise
a signal_non_understanding backward-looking func-
tion and read this as the student asking for assis-
tance, that is, as a request_assistance at the task
dimension. This representation facilitates its treat-
ment according to the teaching model each time. It
is, thus, necessary to represent and recognise the
move, albeit not restrictive as to its treatment. Rep-
resenting such indirect dialogue moves, in general,
allows their easy manipulation according to the de-
sired teaching model, without restricting its choice.

4 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986894736842">
We have presented a dialogue move taxonomy, which
attempts to clearly separate the general dialogue
management attributes of utterances from the genre
and domain specific ones. We claim that such a sep-
aration facilitates a deeper understanding for the ap-
propriate manipulation of the genre specific phenom-
ena and allows their formalisation. That in turn, en-
ables building a reusable and easily reconfigurable
dialogue manager, based on such principles.
We are currently testing the taxonomy and our
hypotheses about valuable inter-relations of dialogue
moves through an annotation programme. The re-
sults of the annotations will give us better grounds
for asserting the hypotheses or altering and amend-
ing the taxonomy. We can then extract an advanced
dialogue model and specify it for the dialogue man-
agement and the manipulation of the complex tu-
torial dialogue phenomena, as well as for the genre
independent dialogue phenomena.

Additionally, however, the modelling of such dialogue based teaching strategies can manipulate psychological aspects of learning, such as help the student build a deeper understanding of the domain, eliminate cognitive load, and promote schema acquisition (Wilson and Cole, 1996; Lim and Moore, 2002). 3.1 Task Dimension Description In order to effect the above mentioned aims, we define a task dimension, which captures functions that are particular to the task at hand and its manipulation, and hence to the genre. It comprises mostly newly defined moves. These moves require special treatment in the tutorial genre or acquire their specific function only due to the genre. They can also only be planned by use of special modules that deal with domain knowledge (cf. (Benzmuller et al., 2003)) or after consulting information on the current student progress.

That is, it provides a better framework for capturing what is generic in dialogue management and, hence, reusable between genres, and, contrary, what is specific to the genre or even the different domains. The latter also makes modelling the genre, and the different domains in it, more straight forward, providing guidelines for what needs to be considered. In such a framework, tutorial systems can make use of the advantages of natural language capabilities in tutoring, which have been discussed in (Moore, 1993), independently from their preferred teaching strategies.

The particular realisation is an open_option in the forward-looking dimension. Given a different dialogue context, however, the same underlying hint function could just as well be an action_directive without altering the hint function at the cognitive level, but serving the dialogue context better. This approach is contrary to what has been done before in modelling tutorial dialogues, which do not distinguish between the cognitive and dialogue function of hints and have, thus, provided no clear account of the status of hints in the proposed dialogue move taxonomies (Person and Graesser, 2003; Core et al., 2002). The hint categories in the hint taxonomy constitute output of a hinting algorithm which is called upon by the dialogue manager (Fiedler and Tsovaltzi, 2003).

Once this is represented, it is up to the implementor to decide on categories for the evaluation of this attempt, that is the domain_contributions relevant to the tutoring purposes. This decision is both domain dependent (different domains might require divergent evaluation methods) and teaching strategy dependent (the information useful for tutoring may vary between models). Hence, it lies beyond the scope of dialogue management. We are currently formalising such categories and incorporating them in feedback managing algorithms, either as domain specific or not, where possible (Tsovaltzi and Fiedler, 2003). These algorithms are external resources for the dialogue manager. Yet a third dialogue move related to the previous two, is the move domain_contribution_evaluation. This super-class comprises dialogue moves which signal the domain evaluation of domain_contributions, and correspond to the above mentioned evaluation categories. The managing of such dialogue moves, e.g. generating them or not, and the tutoring situations which determine such manipulation decisions are very relevant for pedagogical reasons and differ for various teaching models. The need for representing them is , however, commo</context>
