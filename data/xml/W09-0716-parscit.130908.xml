This paper presents the Ontology for Ac-
cessing Transcription Systems (OATS), a
knowledge base that supports interopera-
tion over disparate transcription systems
and practical orthographies. The knowl-
edge base includes an ontological descrip-
tion of writing systems and relations for
mapping transcription system segments
to an interlingua pivot, the IPA. It in-
cludes orthographic and phonemic inven-
tories from 203 African languages. OATS
is motivated by the desire to query data in
the knowledge base via IPA or native or-
thography, and for error checking of dig-
itized data and conversion between tran-
scription systems. The model in this paper
implements these goals.

<bodyText confidence="0.999675526315789">
The World Wide Web has emerged as the pre-
dominate source for obtaining linguistic field data
and language documentation in textual, audio and
video formats. A simple keyword search on the
nearly extinct language Livonian [liv]1 returns nu-
merous results that include text, audio and video
files. As data on the Web continue to increase, in-
cluding material posted by native language com-
munities, researchers are presented with an ideal
medium for the automated discovery and analysis
of linguistic data, e.g. (Lewis, 2006). However,
resources on the Web are not always accessible to
users or software agents. The data often exist in
legacy or proprietary software and data formats.
This makes them difficult to locate and access.
Interoperability of linguistic resources has the
ability to make disparate linguistic data accessible
to researchers. It is also beneficial for data aggre-
gation. Through the use of ontologies, applica-

tions can be written to perform intelligent search
(deriving implicit knowledge from explicit infor-
mation). They can also interoperate between re-
sources, thus allowing data to be shared across ap-
plications and between research communities with
different terminologies, annotations, and notations
for marking up data.
OATS is a knowledge base, i.e. a data source
that uses an ontology to specify the structure of
entities and their relations. It includes general
knowledge of writing systems and transcription
systems that are core to the General Ontology of
Linguistic Description (GOLD)2 (Farrar and Lan-
gendoen, 2003). Other portions of OATS, in-
cluding the relationships encoded for relating seg-
ments of transcription systems, or the computa-
tional representations of these elements, extend
GOLD as a Community of Practice Extension
(COPE) (Farrar and Lewis, 2006). OATS provides
interoperability for transcription systems and prac-
tical orthographies that map phones and phonemes
in unique relationships to their graphemic repre-
sentations. These systematic mappings thus pro-
vide a computationally tractable starting point for
interoperating over linguistic texts. The resources
that are targeted also encompass a wide array of
data on lesser-studied languages of the world, as
well as low density languages, i.e. those with few
electronic resources (Baldwin et al., 2006).
This paper is structured as follows: in section
2, linguistic and technological definitions and ter-
minology are provided. In section 3, the theoreti-
cal and technological challenges of interoperating
over heterogeneous transcriptions systems are de-
scribed. The technologies used in OATS and its
design are presented in section 4. In section 5,
OATS’ implementation is illustrated with linguis-
tic data that was mined from the Web, therefore
motivating the general design objectives taken into

2.1 Conventions

<bodyText confidence="0.9999257">
Standard conventions are used for distinguishing
between graphemic &lt; &gt;, phonemic / / and pho-
netic representations [ ].3 For character data infor-
mation, I follow the Unicode Standard’s notational
conventions (The Unicode Consortium, 2007).
Character names are represented in small capi-
tal letters (e.g. LATIN SMALL LETTER SCHWA)
and code points are expressed as ‘U+n’ where n
is a four to six digit hexadecimal number (e.g.
U+0256), which is rendered as &lt;a&gt;.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980793103449">
In the context of this paper, a transcription sys-
tem is a system of symbols and rules for graphi-
cally transcribing the sounds of a language variety.
A practical orthography is a phonemic writing
system designed for practical use by speakers al-
ready competent in the language. The mapping re-
lation between phonemes and graphemes in prac-
tical orthographies is purposely shallow, i.e. there
is a faithful mapping from a unique sound to a
unique symbol.4 The IPA is often used by field
linguists in the development of practical orthogra-
phies for languages without writing systems. An
orthography specifies the symbols, punctuation,
and the rules in which a language is correctly writ-
ten in a standardized way. All orthographies are
language specific.
Practical orthographies and transcription sys-
tems are both kinds of writing systems. A writing
system is a symbolic system that uses visible or
tactile signs to represent a language in a systematic
way. Differences in the encoding of meaning and
sound form a continuum for representing writing
systems in a typology whose categories are com-
monly referred to as either logographic, syllabic,
phonetic or featural. A logographic system de-
notes symbols that visually represent morphemes
(and sometimes morphemes and syllables). A
syllabic system uses symbols to denote syllables.
A phonetic system represents sound segments as

3Phonemic and phonetic representations are given in the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
4Practical orthographies are intended to jump-start written
materials development by correlating a writing system with
its sound units, making it easier for speakers to master and
acquire literacy.

<bodyText confidence="0.997996588235294">
symbols. Featural systems are less common and
encode phonological features within the shapes of
the symbols represented in the script.
The term script refers to a collection of sym-
bols (or distinct marks) as employed by a writ-
ing system. The term script is confused with and
often used interchangeably with ‘writing system’.
A writing system may be written with different
scripts, e.g. the alphabet writing system can be
written in Roman and Cyrillic scripts (Coulmas,
1999). A grapheme is the unit of writing that
represents a particular abstract representation of a
symbol employed by a writing system. Like the
phoneme is an abstract representation of a distinct
sound in a language, a grapheme is a contrastive
graphical unit in a writing system. A grapheme
is the basic, minimally distinctive symbol of a
writing system. A script may employ multiple
graphemes to represent a single phoneme, e.g. the
graphemes &lt;c&gt; and &lt;h&gt; when conjoined in En-
glish represent one phoneme in English, &lt;ch&gt;
pronounced /#/ (or /k/). The opposite is also found
in writing systems, where a single grapheme rep-
resents two or more phonemes, e.g. &lt;x&gt; in En-
glish is a combination of the phonemes /ks/.
A graph is the smallest unit of written language
(Coulmas, 1999). The electronic counterpart of
the graph is the glyph. Glyphs represent the varia-
tion of graphemes as they appear when rendered or
displayed. In typography glyphs are created using
different illustration techniques. These may result
in homoglyphs, pairs of characters with shapes
that are either identical or are beyond differenti-
ation by swift visual inspection. When rendered
by hand, a writer may use different styles of hand-
writing to produce glyphs in standard handwriting,
cursive, or calligraphy. When rendered computa-
tionally, a repertoire of glyphs makes up a font.
A final distinction is needed for interoperating
over transcription systems. The term scripteme
is used for the use of a grapheme within a writ-
ing system with the particular semantics (i.e., pro-
nunciation) it is assigned within that writing sys-
tem. The notion scripteme is needed because
graphemes may be homoglyphic across scripts and
languages, and the semantics of a grapheme is de-
pendent on the writing system using it. For ex-
ample, the grapheme &lt;p&gt; in Russian represents a
dental or alveolar trill; /r/ in IPA. However, &lt;p&gt; is
realized by English speakers as a voiceless bilabial
stop /p/. The defining of scripteme is necessary
</bodyText>

for interoperability because it provides a level for
mapping a writing system specific grapheme to the
phonological level, allowing the same grapheme
to represent different sounds across different tran-
scription and writing systems.

A document refers to an electronic document that
contains language data. Each document is associ-
ated with metadata and one or more transcription
systems or practical orthographies. A document’s
content is comprised of a set scriptemes from its
transcription system. A mapping relation is an
unordered pair of a scripteme in a transcription
system and its representation in IPA.
OATS first maps scriptemes to their grapheme
equivalent(s). Graphemes are then mapped to
their character equivalents. A character in OATS
is a computational representation of a grapheme.
Character encodings represent a range of inte-
gers known as the code space. A code point is
a unique integer, or point, within this code space.
An abstract character is then mapped to a unique
code point and rendered as an encoded charac-
ter and typographically defined by the font used
to render it. A set of encoded characters is a char-
acter set and different character encodings en-
code characters as numbers via different encoding
schemes.

Three genetically related languages spoken in
Northern Ghana, Sisaala Pasaale [sig], Sisaala

slightly in their orthographies for two reasons:
they have slightly divergent phonemic inventories
and their orthographies may differ graphemically
when representing the same phoneme. See Table

The voiceless labial-velar phoneme /kp/ appears
in both Sisaala Tumulung and Sisaala Pasaale, but
has been lost in Sisaala Western. There is a con-

phoneme /d/ in Sisaala Pasaale (Toupin, 1995).5
These three orthographies also differ because of
their authors’ choices in assigning graphemes to
phonemes. In Sisaala Pasaale and Sisaala West-
ern, the phonemes /#/ and /d3/ are written as &lt;ky&gt;
and &lt;gy&gt;. In Sisaala Tumulung, however, these
sounds are written &lt;ch&gt; and &lt;j&gt;. Orthography
developers may have made these choices for prac-
tical reasons, such as ease of learnability or tech-
nological limitations (Bodomo, 1997). During the
development of practical orthographies for Sisaala
Pasaale and Sisaala Western, the digraphs &lt;ky&gt;
and &lt;gy&gt; were chosen because children learn Da-
gaare [dga] in schools, so they are already famil-
iar with their sounds in the Dagaare orthography
(Mcgill et al., 1999) (Moran, 2008).
Another difference lies in the representation of
vowels. Both Sisaala Pasaale and Sisaala West-
ern represent their full sets of vowels orthograph-
ically. These orthographies were developed rela-
tively recently, when computers, character encod-
ings, and font support, have become less problem-
atic. In Sisaala Tumulung, however, the phonemes
/i/ and /I/ are collapsed to &lt;i&gt;, and /u/ and /u/ to
&lt;u&gt; (Blass, 1975). Sisaala Tumulung’s orthog-
raphy was developed in the 1970s and technologi-
cal limitations may have led its developers to col-
lapse these phonemes in the writing system. For
example, the Ghana Alphabet Committee’s 1990
Report lacks an individual grapheme &lt;q&gt; for the
phoneme /q/ for Dagaare. This difficulty of render-
ing unconventional symbols on typewriters once
posed a challenge for orthography development
(Bodomo, 1997).
Tone is both lexically and grammatically con-
trastive in Sisaala languages. In Sisaala Pasaale’s
official orthography tone is not marked and is not
used in native speaker materials. On the other
hand, in linguistic descriptions that use this or-
thography, tone is marked to disambiguate tonal

lographs &lt;d&gt; (word initial) or &lt;r&gt; (elsewhere) (McGill,

minimal pairs in lexical items and grammatical
constructions (McGill, 2004). In the Sisaala
(Tumulung)-English dictionary, tone is marked
only to disambiguate lexical items (Blass, 1975).
In linguistic descriptions of Sisaala Western, non-
contrastive tone is marked. When tone is marked,
it appears as acute (high tone) and grave (low tone)
accents over vowels or nasals.
Language researchers would quickly pick up on
these minute differences in orthographies. How-
ever, what first seem to be trivial differences, illus-
trate one issue of resource discovery on the Web –
without methods for interoperability, even slightly
divergent resources are more difficult to discover,
query and compare. How would someone re-
searching a comparative analysis of /#/ sounds of
languages in Northern Ghana discover that it is
represented as &lt;ky&gt; and &lt;ch&gt; without first lo-
cating the extremely sparse grammatical informa-
tion available on these languages? Furthermore,
automatic phonetic research is possible on lan-
guages with shallow orthographies (Zuraw, 2006),
but crosslinguistic versions of such work require
interoperation over writing systems.

3.2 Technological challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851260869565">
The main technological challenges in interoperat-
ing over textual electronic resources are: encod-
ing multilingual language text in an interoperable
format and resolving ambiguity between mapping
relations. These are addressed below.
Hundreds of character encoding sets for writ-
ing systems have been developed, e.g. ASCII,
GB 180306 and Unicode. Historically, different
standards were formalized differently and for dif-
ferent purposes by different standards commit-
tees. A lack of interoperability between char-
acter encodings ensued. Linguists, restricted to
standard character sets that lacked IPA support
and other language-specific graphemes that they
needed, made their own solutions (Bird and Si-
mons, 2003). Some chose to represent unavailable
graphemes with substitutes, e.g. the combination
of &lt;ng&gt; to represent &lt;q&gt;. Others redefined se-
lected characters from a character encoding to map
their own fonts to. One linguist’s redefined char-
acter set, however, would not render properly on
another linguist’s computer if they did not share
the same font. If two character encodings defined

<bodyText confidence="0.999780857142857">
two character sets differently, then data could not
be reliably and correctly displayed.
To circumvent these problems, OATS uses the
Unicode Standard7 for multilingual character en-
coding of electronic textual data. Unicode en-
codes 76 scripts and includes the IPA.8 In principle
this allows OATS to interoperate over IPA and all
scripts currently encoded in Unicode. However,
writing systems, scripts and transcriptions are of-
ten themselves encoded ambiguously.
Unicode encodes characters, not glyphs, in
scripts and sometimes unifies duplicate characters
across scripts. For example, IPA characters of
Greek and Latin origin, such as &lt;P&gt; and &lt;k&gt;
are not given a distinct position within Unicode’s
IPA character block. The Unicode code space
is subdivided into character blocks, which gener-
ally encode characters from a single script, but as
is illustrated by the IPA, characters may be dis-
persed across several different character blocks.
This poses a challenge for interoperation, particu-
larly with regard to homographs. Why shouldn’t a
speaker of Russian use the &lt;a&gt; CYRILLIC SMALL
LETTER A at code point U+0430 for IPA transcrip-
tion, instead of &lt;a&gt; LATIN SMALL LETTER A at
code point U+0061, when visually they are indis-
tinguishable?
Homoglyphs come in two flavors: linguistic and
non-linguistic. Linguists are unlikely to distin-
guish between the &lt;a&gt; LATIN SMALL LETTER
SCHWA at code point U+0259 and &lt;a&gt; LATIN
SMALL LETTER TURNED E at U+01DD. And non-
linguists are unlikely to differentiate any seman-
tic difference between an open back unrounded
vowel &lt;a&gt;, the LATIN SMALL LETTER ALPHA
at U+0251, and the open front unrounded vowel
&lt;a&gt;, LATIN SMALL LETTER A at U+0061.
Another challenge is how to handle ambigu-
ity in transcription systems and orthographies. In
Serbo-Croatian, for example, the digraphs &lt;lj&gt;,
&lt;nj&gt; and &lt;dz&gt; represent distinct phonemes and
each are comprised of two graphemes, which
themselves represent distinct phonemes. Words
like &lt;nadzivjeti&gt; ‘to outlive’ are composed of
the morphemes &lt;nad&gt;, a prefix, and the verb
&lt;zivjeti&gt;. In this instance the combination of
&lt;d&gt; and &lt;z&gt; does not represent a single digraph
&lt;dz&gt;; they represent two neighboring phonemes
across a morpheme boundary. Likewise in En-

glish, the grapheme sequence &lt;sh&gt; can be both
a digraph as well as a sequence of graphemes,
as in &lt;mishmash&gt; and &lt;mishap&gt;. When pars-
ing words like &lt;mishit&gt; and &lt;mishear&gt; both
disambiguations are theoretically available. An-
other example is illustrated by &lt;h&gt;, &lt;t&gt;, and
&lt;th&gt;. How should &lt;t&gt; be interpreted be-
fore &lt;h&gt; when English gives us both /t�mas/
‘Thomas’ and /9ioudor/ ‘Theodore’? The Sisaala
Western word &lt;niikyuru&gt; ‘waterfall’ could be
parsed as /niik.yuru/ instead of /nii.#uru/ to speak-
ers unfamiliar with the &lt;ky&gt; digraph of orthogra-
phies of Northwestern Ghana.
These ambiguities are due to mapping relations
between phonemes and graphemes. Transcrip-
tion systems and orthographies often have com-
plex grapheme-to-phoneme relationships and they
vary in levels of phonological abstraction. The
transparency of the relation between spelling and
phonology differ between languages like English
and French, and say Serbo-Croatian. The former
represent deep orthographic systems where the
same grapheme can represent different phonemes
in different contexts. The latter, a shallow or-
thography, is less polyvalent in its grapheme-to-
phoneme relations. Challenges of ambiguity reso-
lution are particularly apparent in data conversion.

In Philosophy, Ontology is the study of existence
and the meaning of being. In the Computer and
Information Sciences, ontology has been co-opted
to represent a data model that represents concepts
within a certain domain and the relationships be-
tween those concepts. At a low level an ontol-
ogy is a taxonomy and a set of inference rules.
At a higher-level, ontologies are collections of in-
formation that have formalized relationships that
hold between entities in a given domain. This pro-
vides the basis for automated reasoning by com-
puter software, where content is given meaning
in the sense of interpreting data and disambiguat-
ing entities. This is the vision of the Semantic
Web,9 a common framework for integrating and
correlating linked data from disparate resources
for interoperability (Beckett, 2004). The Gen-
eral Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD)
is grounded in the Semantic Web and provides
a foundation for the interoperability of linguistic

annotation to enable intelligent search across lin-
guistic resources (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003).
Several technologies are integral to the architec-
ture of the Semantic Web, including Unicode,
XML,10 and the Resource Description Framework
(RDF).11 OATS has been developed with these
technologies and uses SPARQL12 to query the
knowledge base of linked data.
The Unicode Standard is the standard text
encoding for the Web, the recommended best-
practice for encoding linguistic resources, and the
underlying encoding for OATS. XML is a gen-
eral purpose specification for markup languages
and provides a structured language for data ex-
change (Yergeau, 2006). It is the most widely
used implementation for descriptive markup, and
is in fact so extensible that its structure does not
provide functionality for encoding explicit rela-
tionships across documents. Therefore RDF is
needed as the syntax for representing informa-
tion about resources on the Web and it is itself
written in XML and is serializable. RDF de-
scribes resources in the form subject-predicate-
object (or entity-relationship-entity) and identi-
fies unique resources through Uniform Resource
Identifiers (URIs). In this manner, RDF encodes
meaning in sets of triples that resemble subject-
verb-object constructions. These triples form a
graph data structure of nodes and arcs that are
non-hierarchical and can be complexly connected.
Numerous algorithms have been written to access
and manipulate graph structures. Since all URIs
are unique, each subject, object and predicate are
uniquely defined resources that can be referred
to and reused by anyone. URIs give users flex-
ibility in giving concepts a semantic representa-
tion. However, if two individuals are using differ-
ent URIs for the same concept, then a procedure
is needed to know that these two objects are in-
deed equivalent. A common example in linguis-
tic annotation is the synonymous use of genitive
and possessive. By incorporating domain specific
knowledge into an ontology in RDF, disambigua-
tion and interoperation over data becomes pos-
sible. GOLD addresses the challenge of inter-
operability of disparate linguistic annotation and
termsets in morphosyntax by functioning as an in-
terlingua between them. In OATS, the interlingua

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.686226">
4.2 IPA as interlingua
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999576875">
OATS uses the IPA as an interlingua (or pivot)
to which elements of systems of transcription are
mapped. The IPA was chosen for its broad cov-
erage of the sounds of the world’s languages, its
mainstream adoption as a system for transcription
by linguists, and because it is encoded (at least
mostly) in Unicode. The pivot component resides
at the Character ID entity, which is in a one-to-one
relationship with a Unicode Character. The Char-
acter ID entity is provided for mapping characters
to multiple character encodings. This is useful for
mapping IPA characters to legacy character encod-
ing sets like IPA Kiel and SIL IPA93, allowing
for data conversion between character encodings.
The IPA also encodes phonetic segments as small
feature bundles. Phonological theories extend the
idea and interpretation of proposed feature sets,
an area of debate within Linguistics. These issues
should be taken into consideration when encoding
interoperability via an interlingua, and should be
leveraged to expand current theoretical questions
that can be asked of the knowledge base. Charac-
ter semantics also require consideration (Gibbon
et al., 2005). Glyph semantics provide implicit in-
formation such as a resource’s language, its lan-
guage family assignment, its use by a specific so-
cial or scientific group, or corporate identity (Trip-
pel et al., 2007). Documents with IPA characters
or in legacy IPA character encodings provide se-
mantic knowledge regarding the document’s con-
tent, namely, that it contains transcribed linguistic
data.

OATS consists of the following ontological

Each TranscriptionSystem is a set of instances
of Scripteme. Every Scripteme instance is in a
Mapping relation with its IPA counterpart. The
MappingSystem contains a list of Transcription-
System instances that have Scripteme instances
mapped to IPA. The Grapheme class provides
the mapping between Scripteme and Character.
The Character class is the set of Unicode char-

5.1 Data

<bodyText confidence="0.9999005">
The African language data used in OATS were
mined from Syst`emes alphab´etiques des langues
africanies,15 an online database of Alphabets des
langues africaines (Hartell, 1993). Additional
languages were added by hand. Currently, OATS
includes 203 languages from 23 language families.
Each language contains its phonemic and ortho-
graphic inventories.

5.2 Query
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999519727272727">
Linguists gain unprecedented access to linguistic
resources when they are able to query across dis-
parate data in standardized notations regardless of
how the data in those resources is encoded. Cur-
rently OATS contains two phonetic notations for
querying: IPA and X-SAMPA. To illustrate the
querying functionality currently in place, the IPA
is used to query the knowledge base of African
language data16 for the occurrence of two seg-
ments. The first is the voiced palatal nasal /ñ/. The
results are captured in table 2.

&lt;p&gt;, &lt;ni&gt;, and interestingly as &lt;q&gt;. The two
languages containing &lt;q&gt;, Koonzime [ozm] and
Akoose [bss] of Cameroon, both lack a phonemic
/q/. In these languages’ orthographies, both &lt;ny&gt;
and &lt;q&gt; are used to represent the phoneme /p/.
With further investigation, one can determine if
they are contextually determined allographs like
the &lt;d&gt; and &lt;r&gt; in Sisaala Pasaale.
The second simple query retrieves the occur-
rence of the voiced alveo-palatal affricate /d3/. Ta-
ble 3 displays the results from the same sample of
languages.

The voiced alveo-palatal affricate /d3/ is ac-
counted for in 92 languages, or 45%, of the 203
languages sampled. The majority, over 92%, use
the same grapheme &lt;j&gt; to represent /d3/. Other
graphemes found in the language sample include
&lt;dz&gt;, &lt;gy&gt;, &lt;dj&gt;, &lt;d3&gt;, and &lt;ˇg&gt;. The &lt;ˇg&gt;
stands out in this data sample. Interestingly, it
comes from Sudanese Arabic, which uses Latin-
based characters in its orthography. It contains the
phonemes /g/, /g/, and /d3/, which are gramphemi-
cally represented as &lt;g&gt;, &lt;gh&gt; and &lt;ˇg&gt;.
These are rather simplistic examples, but the
graph data structure of RDF, and the power of
SPARQL provides an increasingly complex sys-
tem for querying any data stored in the knowledge
base and relationships as encoded by its ontologi-
cal structure. For example, by combining queries
such as ‘which languages have the phoneme /gb/’
and ‘of those languages which lack its voiceless
counterpart /kp/’, 11 results are found from this
sample of African languages, as outlined in Table

same task as querying the knowledge base via
the pivot. In this case, however, a mapping rela-
tion from the language-specific grapheme to IPA
is first established. Since all transcription systems’
graphemes must have an IPA counterpart, this re-
lationship is always available. A query is then
made across all relevant mapping relations from
IPA to languages within the knowledge base.
For example, a user familiar with the Sisaala
Western orthography queries the knowledge base
for languages with &lt;ky&gt;. Initially, the OATS
system establishes the relationship between &lt;ky&gt;
and its IPA counterpart. In this case, &lt;ky&gt; repre-
sents the voiceless alveo-palatal affricate /#/. Hav-
ing retrieved the IPA counterpart, the query next
retrieves all languages that have /#/ in their phone-
mic inventories. In the present data sample, this
query retrieves 99 languages with the phonemic
voiceless alveo-palatal affricate. If the user then
wishes to compare the graphemic distributions of
/#/ and /d3/, which was predominately &lt;j&gt;, these
results are easily provided. They are displayed in
Table 5.
The 97 occurrences of /#/ account for five more
than the 92 languages sampled in section 5.2 that
had its voiced alveo-palatal affricate counterpart.
Such information provides statistics for phoneme
distribution across languages in the knowledge
base. OATS is a powerful tool for gathering such
knowledge about the world’s languages.

using Protege,17 an open source ontology editor
developed by Stanford Center for Biomedical In-
formatics Research. The use of Protege was pri-
marily to jump start the design and implementa-
tion of the ontology. The software provides a user
interface for ontology modeling and development,
and exports the results into RDF. After the archi-
tecture was in place, the second step was the de-
velopment of a code base in Python18 for gather-
ing data and working with RDF. This code base
includes two major pieces. The first was the de-
velopment of a scraper, which was used to gather
phonemic inventories off of the Web by download-
ing Web pages and scraping them for relevant con-
tents. Each language was collected with its ISO
639-3 code, and its orthographic inventory and
the mapping relation between these symbols and
their IPA phonemic symbols. The second chunk of
the code base provides functionality for working
with the RDF graph and uses RDFLib,19 an RDF
Python module. The code includes scripts that add
all relevant language data that was scraped from
the Web to the OATS RDF graph, it fills the graph
with the Unicode database character tables, and
provides SPARQL queries for querying the graph
as illustrated above. There is also Python code for
using OATS to convert between two character sets,
and for error checking of characters within a doc-
ument that are not in the target set.

query, and multilingual character encoding, OATS
is designed to facilitate resource discovery and
intelligent search over linguistic data. The cur-
rent knowledge base includes an ontological de-
scription of writing systems and specifies rela-
tions for mapping segments of transcription sys-
tems to their IPA equivalents. IPA is used as the
interlingua pivot that provides the ability to query
across all resources in the knowledge base. OATS’
data source includes 203 African languages’ or-
thographic and phonemic inventories.
The case studies proposed and implemented in
this paper present functionality to use OATS to
query all data in the knowledge base via stan-
dards like the IPA. OATS also supports query via
any transcription system or practical orthography
in the knowledge base. Another outcome of the
OATS project is the ability to check for incon-
sistencies in digitized lexical data. The system
could also test linguist-proposed phonotactic con-
straints and look for exceptions in data. Data
from grapheme-to-phoneme mappings, phonotac-
tics and character encodings can provide an ortho-
graphic profile/model of a transcription or writing
system. This could help to bootstrap software and
resource development for low-density languages.
OATS also provides prospective uses for docu-
ment conversion and development of probabilistic
models of orthography-to-phoneme mappings.

The knowledge base includes an ontological description of writing systems and relations for mapping transcription system segments to an interlingua pivot, the IPA. It includes orthographic and phonemic inventories from 203 African languages. OATS is motivated by the desire to query data in the knowledge base via IPA or native orthography, and for error checking of digitized data and conversion between transcription systems.

OATS provides interoperability for transcription systems and practical orthographies that map phones and phonemes in unique relationships to their graphemic representations. These systematic mappings thus provide a computationally tractable starting point for interoperating over linguistic texts. The resources that are targeted also encompass a wide array of data on lesser-studied languages of the world, as well as low density languages, i.e. those with few electronic resources (Baldwin et al., 2006). This paper is structured as follows: in section 2, linguistic and technological definitions and terminology are provided. In section 3, the theoretical and technological challenges of interoperating over heterogeneous transcriptions systems are described.

At a low level an ontology is a taxonomy and a set of inference rules. At a higher-level, ontologies are collections of information that have formalized relationships that hold between entities in a given domain. This provides the basis for automated reasoning by computer software, where content is given meaning in the sense of interpreting data and disambiguating entities. This is the vision of the Semantic Web,9 a common framework for integrating and correlating linked data from disparate resources for interoperability (Beckett, 2004).

These are addressed below. Hundreds of character encoding sets for writing systems have been developed, e.g. ASCII, GB 180306 and Unicode. Historically, different standards were formalized differently and for different purposes by different standards committees. A lack of interoperability between character encodings ensued. Linguists, restricted to standard character sets that lacked IPA support and other language-specific graphemes that they needed, made their own solutions (Bird and Simons, 2003). Some chose to represent unavailable graphemes with substitutes, e.g. the combination of &lt;ng&gt; to represent &lt;q&gt;. Others redefined selected characters from a character encoding to map their own fonts to. One linguist’s redefined character set, however, would not render properly on another linguist’s computer if they did not share the same font.

Featural systems are less common and encode phonological features within the shapes of the symbols represented in the script. The term script refers to a collection of symbols (or distinct marks) as employed by a writing system. The term script is confused with and often used interchangeably with ‘writing system’. A writing system may be written with different scripts, e.g. the alphabet writing system can be written in Roman and Cyrillic scripts (Coulmas, 1999). A grapheme is the unit of writing that represents a particular abstract representation of a symbol employed by a writing system. Like the phoneme is an abstract representation of a distinct sound in a language, a grapheme is a contrastive graphical unit in a writing system. A grapheme is the basic, minimally distinctive symbol of a writing system. A script may employ multiple graphemes to represent a single phoneme, e.g. the graphemes &lt;c&gt; and &lt;h&gt; when conjoined in English represent one phoneme in English, &lt;ch&gt; pronounced /#/ (or /k/).

The model in this paper implements these goals. 1 Introduction The World Wide Web has emerged as the predominate source for obtaining linguistic field data and language documentation in textual, audio and video formats. A simple keyword search on the nearly extinct language Livonian [liv]1 returns numerous results that include text, audio and video files. As data on the Web continue to increase, including material posted by native language communities, researchers are presented with an ideal medium for the automated discovery and analysis of linguistic data, e.g. (Lewis, 2006). However, resources on the Web are not always accessible to users or software agents. The data often exist in legacy or proprietary software and data formats. This makes them difficult to locate and access. Interoperability of linguistic resources has the ability to make disparate linguistic data accessible to researchers. It is also beneficial for data aggregation. Through the use of ontologies, applica1ISO 639-3 language codes are in []. tions can be written to perform intelligent search (deriving implicit knowledge from explicit information).

Furthermore, automatic phonetic research is possible on languages with shallow orthographies (Zuraw, 2006), but crosslinguistic versions of such work require interoperation over writing systems. 3.2 Technological challenges The main technological challenges in interoperating over textual electronic resources are: encoding multilingual language text in an interoperable format and resolving ambiguity between mapping relations.
