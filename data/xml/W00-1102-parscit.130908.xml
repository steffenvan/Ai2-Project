This paper describes an experiment aiming at
evaluating the role of NLP based optimizations
(i.e. morphological derivation and synonymy
expansion) in web search strategies. Keywords
and their expansions are composed in two
different Boolean expressions (i.e. expansion
insertion and Cartesian combination) and then
compared with a keyword conjunctive
composition, considered as the baseline.
Results confirm the hypothesis that linguistic
optimizations significantly improve the search
engine performances.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999544724137931">
The purpose of this work was to verify if, and in
which measure, some linguistic optimizations
on the input query can improve the performance
of an existing search engine on the webl.
First of all we tried to determine a proper
baseline to compare the optimized search
strategies. Such a baseline should reflect as
much as possible the average use of the search
engine by typical users when querying the web.
A query is usually composed of a limited
number of keywords (i.e. two or three), in a
lemmatized form, that the search engine
composes by default in a conjunctive
I The results reported in this paper are part of a more
extended project under development at ITC-irst,
which involves a collaboration with Kataweb, an
Italian web portal. We thank both Kataweb and
Inktomi Corporation for kindly having placed the
search engine for the experiments at our disposal.
expression. Starting from this level (we call it
&amp;quot;basic level&amp;quot;) we have designed two more
sophisticated search strategies that introduce a
number of linguistic optimizations over the
keywords and adopt two composition modalities
allowed by the &amp;quot;advanced search&amp;quot; capabilities of
the search engine. One modality (i.e. Keyword
expansion Insertion Search - KIS) first expands
each keyword of the base level with
morphological derivations and synonyms, then
it builds a Boolean expression where each
expansion is added to the base keyword list. The
second modality (i.e. Keyword Cartesian
expansion Search - KCS) adopts the same
expansions of the previous one, but composes a
Boolean expression where all the possible tuples
among the base keywords and expansions are
considered.
The working hypothesis is that the introduction
of lexical expansions should bring an
improvement in the retrieval of relevant
documents. To verify the hypothesis, a
comparative evaluation has been carried out
using the three search modalities described
above over a set of factual questions. The results
of the queries have been manually scored along
a five value scale, with the aim of taking into
account not only the presence in the document
of the answer to the question, but also the
degree of contextual information provided by
the document itself with respect to the question.
Both the presence of the answer and the
contextual information have been estimated by
two relevance functions, one that considers the
document position, the other that does not.
The experiment results confirm that the
introduction of a limited number of lexical
expansions (i.e. 2-3) improves the engine
performance. In addition, the Cartesian

composition of the expansions behaves
significantly better than the search modality
based on keyword insertion.
Some of the problems that we faced with in this
work have been already discussed in previous
works in the literature. The use of query
expansions for text retrieval is a debated topic.
Voorhees (1998) argues that WordNet derived
query expansions are effective for very short
queries, while they do not bring any
improvements for long queries. From a number
of experiments (Mandala et al., 1998) conclude
that WordNet query expansions can increase
recall but degrade precision performances. Three
reasons are suggested to explain this behavior:
(i) the lack of relations among terms of different
parts of speech in WordNet; (ii) many semantic
relations are not present in WordNet; (iii) proper
names are not included in WordNet. (Gonzalo et
al., 1998) pointed out some more weaknesses of
WordNet for Information Retrieval purposes, in
particular the lack of domain information and
the fact that sense distinctions are excessively
fine-grained for the task. A related topic of
query expansion is query translation, which is
performed in Cross-Language Information
Retrieval (Verdejo et al. 2000).
This work brings additional elements in favor of
the thesis that using linguistic expansions can
improve IR in a web search scenario. In addition
we argue that, to be effective, query expansion
has to be combined with proper search
modalities. The evaluation experiment we
carried out, even within the limitations due to
time and budget constraints, was designed to
take into account the indications that came out
at the recent TREC workshop on Question
Answering (Voorhees, 2000).
The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 and
2 respectively present the modalities for the
linguistic expansion and for the query
composition. Section 3 reports the experimental
setting for the comparative evaluation of the
three search modalities. Section 4 describes and
discusses the results obtained, while in the
conclusions we propose some directions for
future work.

1 Lexical expansion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999593285714286">
Two kinds of lexical expansion have been used
in the experiment: morphological derivations
and synonym expansions. Both of them try to
expand a &amp;quot;basic-keyword&amp;quot;, that is a keyword
directly derived from a natural language
question. The language used in the experiments
is Italian.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999282">
1.1 Basic keywords
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995051">
The idea is that this level of keywords should
reflect as much as possible the words used by an
average user to query a web search engine.
Given a question expressed with a natural
language sentence, its basic keywords are
derived selecting the lemmas for each content
word of the question. Verbs are transformed in
their corresponding nominalization. Furthermore
we decided to consider collocations and
multiwords as single keywords, as most of the
currently available search engines allow the user
to specify &amp;quot;phrases&amp;quot; in a very simple way. In the
experiments presented in the paper multiword
expressions are manually recognized and then
added to the basic keyword list.
Figure 1 shows a couple of questions with their
respective basic keywords.

1.2 Morphological derivation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781444444445">
Morphological derivations are considered
because they introduce new lemmas that we
might find in possible correct answers to the
question, improving in this way the engine
recall. For instance, for a question like &amp;quot;Chi ha
inventato la luce elettrica?&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Who invented the
electric light?&amp;quot;) we can imagine different
contexts for the correct answer, such as &amp;quot;la luce
elettrica fu inventata da Edison&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Electric light

electric light was Edison&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;L&apos;invenzione della
luce elettrica e dovuta a Edison&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The invention
of electric light is due to Edison&amp;quot;), where
different morphological derivations of the same
basic keyword &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;inventor&amp;quot;) appear.
Derivations have been automatically extracted
from an Italian monolingual dictionary (Disc,
1997), and collected without considering the
derivation order (i.e. &amp;quot;inventare&amp;quot; belongs to the
derivation set of &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot; even if in the actual
derivation it is the noun that derives from the
verb).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979541">
1.3 Synonyms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926517241379">
Keyword expansion based on synonyms can
potentially improve the system recall, as the
answer to the question might contain synonyms
of the basic keyword. For instance, the answer
to the question &amp;quot;Chi ha inventato la luce
elettrica?&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Who invented the electric light?&amp;quot;)
might be one among &amp;quot;Lo scopritore della luce
elettrica fu Edison&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The discoverer of electric
light was Edison&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;L&apos; inventore della
illuminazione elettrica fu Edison&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The
inventor of electric illumination was Edison&amp;quot;),
&amp;quot;La scopritore della illuminazione elettrica fu
Edison&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The discoverer of electric
illumination was Edison&amp;quot;), where different
synonyms of &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;inventor&amp;quot;) and &amp;quot;luce
elettrica&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;electric light&amp;quot;) appear. In the
experiment reported in section 3 Italian
synonyms have been manually extracted from
the ItalianWordnet database (Roventini et a/.,
2000), a further extension of the Italian Wordnet
produced by the EuroWordNet project (Vossen,
1998). Once the correct synset for a basic
keyword is selected, its synonyms are added to
the expansion list. In the near future we plan to
automate the process of synset selection using
word domain disambiguation, a variant of word
sense disambiguation based on subject field
code information added to WordNet (Magnini
and Cavaglia, 2000).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99276">
1.4 Expansion chains
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950408666666667">
The expansions described in the previous
sections could be recursively applied to every
lemma derived by a morphological or a
synonym expansion. For example, at the first
expansion level we can pass from &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;inventor&amp;quot; to its synonym &amp;quot;scopritore&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;discoverer&amp;quot;, from which in turn we can
morphologically derive the noun &amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot;,
and so on (cfr. Figure 2). This would allow the
retrieval of answers such as &amp;quot;La scoperta della
lampada ad incandescenza è dovuta a Edison&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;The discovery of the incandescent lamp is due
to Edison&amp;quot;).
Although in the experiment reported in this
paper we do not use recursive expansions (i.e.
we stop at the first level of the expansion chain),
a long term goal of this work is to verify their
effects on the document relevance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988153846154">
We wanted to take advantage of the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot;
capabilities of the search engine. In particular
we experimented the &amp;quot;Boolean phrase&amp;quot;
modality, which allows the user to submit
queries with keywords composed by means of
logical operators. However we quickly realised
that realistic choices were restricted to disjoint
compositions of short AND clauses (i.e. with a
limited number of elements, typically not more
than four). This constrained us to two
hypothesis, described in sections 2.2 and 2.3,
which have been compared with a baseline
composition strategy, described in 2.1.

retrieved, both an AND clause with the basic
keywords and all the single basic keywords are
added as disjoint elements. Figure 4 reports an
example. If the AND combination of the basic
keywords produces a non empty set of
documents, then the MS modality should return
the same set of documents rearranged by the
presence of the keyword expansions. What we
expect is an improvement in the position of a
significant document, which is relevant when
huge amounts of documents are retrieved.

Each question was then associated with a
corresponding human-generated set of basic
keywords, resulting in an ordered list of [nl-

maximum of 3 basic keywords for each

evaluation session.
Fifteen researchers at ITC-irst were selected as
assessors in the experiment. They were asked to
judge the web documents returned by the query
generator with respect to a given question,
choosing a value among the following five:
1) answer in_context: The answer
corresponding to the question is recovered and
the document context is appropriate. For
example, if the question is &amp;quot;Who is the inventor
of the electric light?&amp;quot; then &amp;quot;Edison&amp;quot; is reported
in the document, in some way, as the inventor of
the electric light and the whole document deals
with inventors and/or Edison&apos;s life.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969076096774194">
2) answer no_context: The answer to the
question is recovered but the document context
is not appropriate. (e.g. the document does not
deal neither with inventors or Edison&apos;s life).
3) no_answer in_context: The answer
corresponding to the question is not recovered
but the document context is appropriate.
4) no_answer_no_context: The answer
corresponding to the question is not recovered
and the document context is not appropriate.
5) no_document: the requested document is not
retrieved.
The following instructions were provided to
assessors:
• The judgement has to be based on the
document text only, that is no further links
exploration is allowed.
• If a question is considered ambiguous then
give it just one interpretation and use that
interpretation to judge all question-related
documents consistently. For example, if the
question &amp;quot;Chi 6 il vincitore del Tour de
France?&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Who is the winner of the Tour
de France?&amp;quot;) is considered ambiguous
because the answer may change over time,
then the assessor could decide that the
correct interpretation is &amp;quot;Who is the winner
of the 1999 Tour de France?&amp;quot; and judge all
the documents consistently.
• A document contains the answer only if it is
explicitly reported in the text. That is, if the

it is not sufficient that the string &amp;quot;Robert
Sheckley&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sheckley&amp;quot; is in the text, but
the document has to say that Robert
Sheckley is the author of Options.
Each question was judged independently by
three assessors. The number of texts to be
judged for a question ranged from 10 to 18, with
an average of 12. For each question k we
obtained three sets VICAS,k, VKIS,k and VKcs,k of
(pos, assessment) pairs corresponding to the
three search methods, where pos is the position
of the document in the ordered list returned by
the search method, and assessment is the

Table 2 shows the assessments on the KAS
search method, which we consider the baseline
of the experiment, being search by keywords a
standard search method on the Web.
Results are presented for three partitions of the
question set. QS1 is the subset of questions
whose number of morphological derivations and
synonyms is higher than three; QS2 is the subset
whose number of lexical expansions is equal to
two or three; QS3 is the subset whose number of
lexical expansions is lower than two. The table
reports the average values of f (i.e. document
order not considered) and (i.e. order
considered) with respect to each partition. The
obtained values, f 0.23 and f., 0.25, indicate
that, on average, about 2 web documents have
an answer in_context assessment and 7 web
documents have no_answer no_context
assessment out of 10 documents returned by this
method.

Table 3 reports the relevance values for the

remarkable improvement in the KCS

greater than f, meaning that KCS recovers good
web documents in a better position than KAS.
On QS3 there is also a good performance of

From the data presented here it does not emerge
a clear correlation between the performance of a
search method and the number of lexical
expansions. It can be noted that both MS and
KCS perform quite well, compared with KAS,
on the set of questions having no expansions.
This can be explained because MS and KCS
create queries less restrictive than KAS and are
able to recover the same documents of KAS as
well as other documents that can be meaningful.
In case lexical expansions are present, the best
performance compared with KAS is carried out
by KCS method on question 1 (Figure 6), which
have a total of four derivations and four
synonyms. In this case KAS recovered two
documents and KCS more than ten documents,
improving also the answer in_context
assessments thanks to both the morphological
derivation &amp;quot;invenzione&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;invention&amp;quot;) and the
synonym &amp;quot;lampadina_ elettrica&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;electric_lamp&amp;quot;).

It is not clear if synonyms affect search
performance more than morphological
derivation or vice versa. It seems that synonyms
and morphological derivations are significant
expansions in the same way. If we consider the
set of the questions characterised by an
improvement in the KCS and MS performance
compared with KAS performance, then there are
four questions having the number of synonyms
greater than the number of morphological
derivations, three questions having the number
of synonyms lower than the number of
morphological derivations and three questions
having the number of synonyms equal to the
number of morphological derivations (zero
included).
If we consider the set of questions having the
number of synonyms higher than the number of
morphological derivations, then there are four
cases out of eight where MS and KCS enhance
the performance of KAS. If instead we consider
the set of questions having the number of
synonyms lower than the number of
morphological derivations there are three cases
out of six where MS and KCS enhance the
performance of KAS.
Finally, Table 4 synthetically shows how MS
and KCS perform with respect to document
&amp;quot;context retrieval&amp;quot;, that is the degree of
contextual information provided by the
document with respect to the question, no
matter if the answer to the question was present
or not in the document itself. To focus on
context we set the tuning functions a(x) and
0(x) to a(0 )=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=0, a(3)=1/3 and
13(x)=0. The reason for considering a context
retrieval score is that, in case the answer is not
present, context increases the probability that
other relevant documents can be found
following hypertextual links, possibly including
the correct answer to the question.
Results obtained with MS and KCS confirm
that they provide a significant increase (from
31% to 41%) of context retrieval score.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975755555555">
A comparative experiment among three search
strategies has been carried out with the aim of
estimating the benefits of lexical expansions and
of composition strategies over the basic
keywords of a query. Results lead us believe
that search strategies that combine a number of
linguistic optimizations with a proper Boolean
composition can improve the performance of an
existing search engine on the web. In particular
given KAS (no expansions, with AND
composition search) as baseline, MS (expansion
insertion search) performs better but one case
(i.e. with expansions greater than 3) and KCS
(Cartesian composition search) performs better
than MS. Furthermore, KCS has a maximum
performance, with expansions equal to 2 or 3,
significantly higher than MS, probably because
KCS retrieves web documents that are not
retrieved by MS, which basically rearranges the
order of KAS documents.
At present we still have no clear data to
determine which number and which kind (i.e.
morphological derivations and synonyms) of
lexical expansions performs better for a single
question, even if all the three search strategies
definitely perform better with questions with a
limited number of expansions (i.e. two or three).
An evaluation that will take into considerations
such variations is planned for the near future. A
crucial related problem for the future is that of
the automatic evaluation of the search strategies
(see Breck et al., 2000), which will enormously
speed up the design and evaluation cycle.
The experiments reported in this paper are part
of a feasibility study for the realisation of a
Natural Language Based search engine on the
Web. At the present state of development, some
steps in the query expansion (i.e. multiword
recognition and synset selection) have been
done manually, while both the keyword
composition and the actual search are automatic
and very efficient. In order to completely
automate the process, the main source of
inefficiency is likely to be keywords
disambiguation in WordNet. The idea is to use a

In the experiment reported in section 3 Italian synonyms have been manually extracted from the ItalianWordnet database (Roventini et a/., 2000), a further extension of the Italian Wordnet produced by the EuroWordNet project (Vossen, 1998). Once the correct synset for a basic keyword is selected, its synonyms are added to the expansion list. In the near future we plan to automate the process of synset selection using word domain disambiguation, a variant of word sense disambiguation based on subject field code information added to WordNet (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000). 1.4 Expansion chains The expansions described in the previous sections could be recursively applied to every lemma derived by a morphological or a synonym expansion. For example, at the first expansion level we can pass from &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot; &amp;quot;inventor&amp;quot; to its synonym &amp;quot;scopritore&amp;quot; &amp;quot;discoverer&amp;quot;, from which in turn we can morphologically derive the noun &amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot;, and so on (cfr. Figure 2).

Three reasons are suggested to explain this behavior: (i) the lack of relations among terms of different parts of speech in WordNet; (ii) many semantic relations are not present in WordNet; (iii) proper names are not included in WordNet. (Gonzalo et al., 1998) pointed out some more weaknesses of WordNet for Information Retrieval purposes, in particular the lack of domain information and the fact that sense distinctions are excessively fine-grained for the task. A related topic of query expansion is query translation, which is performed in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (Verdejo et al. 2000). This work brings additional elements in favor of the thesis that using linguistic expansions can improve IR in a web search scenario. In addition we argue that, to be effective, query expansion has to be combined with proper search modalities. The evaluation experiment we carried out, even within the limitations due to time and budget constraints, was designed to take into account the indications that came out at the recent TREC workshop on Question Answering (Voorhees, 2000). The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 and 2 respectively present the modalities for the linguistic expansion</context>

The experiment results confirm that the introduction of a limited number of lexical expansions (i.e. 2-3) improves the engine performance. In addition, the Cartesian 13 composition of the expansions behaves significantly better than the search modality based on keyword insertion. Some of the problems that we faced with in this work have been already discussed in previous works in the literature. The use of query expansions for text retrieval is a debated topic. Voorhees (1998) argues that WordNet derived query expansions are effective for very short queries, while they do not bring any improvements for long queries. From a number of experiments (Mandala et al., 1998) conclude that WordNet query expansions can increase recall but degrade precision performances. Three reasons are suggested to explain this behavior: (i) the lack of relations among terms of different parts of speech in WordNet; (ii) many semantic relations are not present in WordNet; (iii) proper names are not included in WordNet.

In the experiment reported in section 3 Italian synonyms have been manually extracted from the ItalianWordnet database (Roventini et a/., 2000), a further extension of the Italian Wordnet produced by the EuroWordNet project (Vossen, 1998). Once the correct synset for a basic keyword is selected, its synonyms are added to the expansion list. In the near future we plan to automate the process of synset selection using word domain disambiguation, a variant of word sense disambiguation based on subject field code information added to WordNet (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000). 1.4 Expansion chains The expansions described in the previous sections could be recursively applied to every lemma derived by a morphological or a synonym expansion. For example, at the first expansion level we can pass from &amp;quot;inventore&amp;quot; &amp;quot;inventor&amp;quot; to its synonym &amp;quot;</context>
