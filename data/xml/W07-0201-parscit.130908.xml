<bodyText confidence="0.999530428571428">
In this paper, we discuss two graphs in
Wikipedia (i) the article graph, and (ii)
the category graph. We perform a graph-
theoretic analysis of the category graph,
and show that it is a scale-free, small
world graph like other well-known lexi-
cal semantic networks. We substantiate
our findings by transferring semantic re-
latedness algorithms defined on WordNet
to the Wikipedia category graph. To as-
sess the usefulness of the category graph
as an NLP resource, we analyze its cover-
age and the performance of the transferred
semantic relatedness algorithms.

Wikipedia1 is a free multi-lingual online encyclo-
pedia that is constructed in a collaborative effort
of voluntary contributors and still grows exponen-
tially. During this process, Wikipedia has proba-
bly become the largest collection of freely available
knowledge. A part of this knowledge is encoded in
the network structure of Wikipedia pages. In par-
ticular, Wikipedia articles form a network of seman-
tically related terms, while the categories are orga-
nized in a taxonomy-like structure called Wikipedia
Category Graph (WCG).
In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of
the WCG by computing a set of graph-theoretic pa-
rameters, and comparing them with the parameters
reported for well-known graphs and classical lexical
semantic networks. We show that the WCG, which
is constructed collaboratively, shares many proper-
ties with other lexical semantic networks, such as

that are constructed by expert authors. This implies
that the WCG can be used as a resource in NLP ap-
plications, where other semantic networks have been
traditionally employed.
To further evaluate this issue, we adapt algorithms
for computing semantic relatedness on classical se-
mantic networks like WordNet to the WCG. We
evaluate their performance on the task of computing
semantic relatedness using three German datasets,
and show that WCG based algorithms perform very
well.
Article graph Wikipedia articles are heavily
linked, as links can be easily inserted while editing
an article. If we treat each article as a node, and
each link between articles as an edge running from
one node to another, then Wikipedia articles form
a directed graph (see right side of Figure 1). The
article graph has been targeted by numerous stud-
ies, and is not addressed in this paper. Buriol et al.
(2006) analyze the development of the article graph
over time, and find that some regions are fairly sta-
ble, while others are advancing quickly. Zlatic et al.

parameters for the largest languages in Wikipedia.
Capocci et al. (2006) study the growth of the article
graph and show that it is based on preferential at-
tachment (Barabasi and Albert, 1999). Voss (2005)
shows that the article graph is scale-free and grows
exponentially.
Category graph Categories in Wikipedia are or-
ganized in a taxonomy-like structure (see left side of
Figure 1 and Figure 2-a). Each category can have an
arbitrary number of subcategories, where a subcate-
gory is typically established because of a hyponymy
or meronymy relation. For example, a category ve-
hicle has subcategories like aircraft or watercraft.
Thus, the WCG is very similar to semantic word-
nets like WordNet or GermaNet (Kunze, 2004). As
Wikipedia does not strictly enforce a taxonomic cat-
egory structure, cycles and disconnected categories
are possible, but rare. In the snapshot of the Ger-
man Wikipedia3 from May 15, 2006, the largest con-
nected component in the WCG contains 99,8% of all
category nodes, as well as 7 cycles.
In Wikipedia, each article can link to an arbitrary
number of categories, where each category is a kind
of semantic tag for that article. A category back-
links to all articles in this category. Thus, article
graph and WCG are heavily interlinked (see Fig-
ure 1), and most studies (Capocci et al., 2006; Zlatic
et al., 2006) have not treated them separately. How-
ever, the WCG should be treated separately, as it
differs from the article graph. Article links are es-
tablished because of any kind of relation between

articles, while links between categories are typically
established because of hyponymy or meronymy re-
lations.
Holloway et al. (2005) create and visualize a cat-
egory map based on co-occurrence of categories.
Voss (2006) pointed out that the WCG is a kind of
thesaurus that combines collaborative tagging and
hierarchical indexing. Zesch et al. (2007a) identified
the WCG as a valueable source of lexical semantic
knowledge, but did not analytically analyze its prop-
erties. However, even if the WCG seems to be very
similar to other semantic wordnets, a graph-theoretic
analysis of the WCG is necessary to substantiate this
claim. It is carried out in the next section.

A graph-theoretic analysis of the WCG is required
to estimate, whether graph based semantic related-
ness measures developed for semantic wordnets can
be transferred to the WCG. This is substantiated in
a case study on computing semantic relatedness in
section 4.
For our analysis, we treat the directed WCG as
an undirected graph G := (V, E),4 as the relations
connecting categories are reversible. V is a set of
vertices or nodes. E is a set of unordered pairs of
distinct vertices, called edges. Each page is treated
as a node n, and each link between pages is modeled
as an edge a running between two nodes.

degree k of a node is the number of edges that are
connected with this node. Averaging over all nodes
gives the average degree k. The degree distribution
P(k) is the probability that a random node will have
degree k. In some graphs (like the WWW), the de-
gree distribution follows a power law P(k) ^ k−γ
(Barabasi and Albert, 1999). We use the power law
exponent -y as a graph parameter.
A path pi,j is a sequence of edges that connects
a node ni with a node nj. The path length l(pi,j)
is the number of edges along that path. There can
be more than one path between two nodes. The
shortest path length L is the minimum of all these
paths, i.e. Li,j = min l(pi,j). Averaging over all
nodes gives the average shortest path length L.
The diameter D is the maximum of the shortest path
lengths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
The cluster coefficient of a certain node ni can
be computed as

<equation confidence="0.940663">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.969583444444445">
where Ti refers to the number of edges between the
neighbors of node ni and ki(ki − 1)/2 is the maxi-
mum number of edges that can exist between the ki
neighbors of node ni.5 The cluster coefficient C for
the whole graph is the average of all Ci. In a fully
connected graph, the cluster coefficient is 1.
5In a social network, the cluster coefficient measures how
many of my friends (neighboring nodes) are friends themselves.
For our analysis, we use a snapshot of the German
Wikipedia from May 15, 2006. We consider only the
largest connected component of the WCG that con-
tains 99,8% of the nodes. Table 1 shows our results
on the WCG as well as the corresponding values for
other well-known graphs and lexical semantic net-
works. We compare our empirically obtained values
with the values expected for a random graph. Fol-
lowing Zlatic et al. (2006), the cluster coefficient C
for a random graph is

<equation confidence="0.824251">
Crandom = |V |k

<bodyText confidence="0.999927764705882">
The average path length for a random network can
be approximated as Lrandom ^ log |V  |/ log k
(Watts and Strogatz, 1998).
From the analysis, we conclude that all graphs
in Table 1 are small world graphs (see Figure 2-c).
Small world graphs (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) con-
tain local clusters that are connected by some long
range links leading to low values of L and D. Thus,
small world graphs are characterized by (i) small
values of L (typically L &gt; Lrandom), together with
(ii) large values of C (C » Crandom).
Additionally, all semantic networks are scale-free
graphs, as their degree distribution follows a power
law. Structural commonalities between the graphs
in Table 1 are assumed to result from the growing
process based on preferential attachment (Capocci
et al., 2006).

Our analysis shows that WordNet and the WCG
are (i) scale-free, small world graphs, and (ii) have a
very similar parameter set. Thus, we conclude that
algorithms designed to work on the graph structure
of WordNet can be transferred to the WCG.
In the next section, we introduce the task of com-
puting semantic relatedness on graphs and adapt ex-
isting algorithms to the WCG. In section 4, we eval-
uate the transferred algorithms with respect to corre-
lation with human judgments on SR, and coverage.

3 Graph Based Semantic Relatedness
Measures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825625">
Semantic similarity (SS) is typically defined via the
lexical relations of synonymy (automobile – car)
and hypernymy (vehicle – car), while semantic re-
latedness (SR) is defined to cover any kind of lexi-
cal or functional association that may exist between
two words (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). Dissimi-
lar words can be semantically related, e.g. via func-
tional relationships (night – dark) or when they are
antonyms (high – low). Many NLP applications re-
quire knowledge about semantic relatedness rather
than just similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).
We introduce a number of competing approaches
for computing semantic relatedness between words
using a graph structure, and then discuss the changes
that are necessary to adapt semantic relatedness al-
gorithms to work on the WCG.

3.1 Wordnet Based Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999273">
A multitude of semantic relatedness measures work-
ing on semantic networks has been proposed.
Rada et al. (1989) use the path length (PL) be-
tween two nodes (measured in edges) to compute
semantic relatedness.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994448">
distPL = l(n1, n2)

Leacock and Chodorow (1998, LC) normalize the

l(n1, n2)
simLC(n1, n2) = − log
2 x depth
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999842857142857">
where depth is the length of the longest path in the
graph.
Wu and Palmer (1994, WP) introduce a measure
that uses the notion of a lowest common subsumer of
two nodes lcs(n1, n2). In a directed graph, a lcs is
the parent of both child nodes with the largest depth
in the graph.

l(n1, lcs) + l(n2, lcs) + 2 depth(lcs)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9848565">
Resnik (1995, Res), defines semantic similarity be-
tween two nodes as the information content (IC)
value of their lcs. He used the relative corpus fre-
quency to estimate the information content value.
Jiang and Conrath (1997, JC) additionally use the
IC of the nodes.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.962384">
distJC(n1, n2) = IC(n1) + IC(n2) − 2IC(lcs)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9931965">
Note that JC returns a distance value instead of a
similarity value.
Lin (1998, Lin) defined semantic similarity using
a formula derived from information theory.

IC(lcs)
simLin(n1, n2) = 2 x IC(n1) + IC(n2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994685">
Because polysemous words may have more than
one corresponding node in a semantic wordnet, the
resulting semantic relatedness between two words
w1 and w2 can be calculated as

3.2 Adapting SR Measures to Wikipedia
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959909090909">
Unlike other wordnets, nodes in the WCG do not
represent synsets or single terms, but a general-
ized concept or category. Therefore, we cannot use
the WCG directly to compute SR. Additionally, the
WCG would not provide sufficient coverage, as it is
relatively small. Thus, transferring SR measures to
the WCG requires some modifications. The task of
estimating SR between terms is casted to the task
of SR between Wikipedia articles devoted to these
terms. SR between articles is measured via the cate-
gories assigned to these articles.

termine the SR value for each category pair (ck, cl)
with ck E C1 and cl E C2. We choose the best

See (Zesch et al., 2007b) for a more detailed descrip-
tion of the adaptation process.
We substitute Resnik’s information content with
the intrinsic information content (IIC) by Seco et
al. (2004) that is computed only from structural in-
formation of the underlying graph. It yields better
results and is corpus independent. The IIC of a node
ni is computed as a function of its hyponyms,

ni and |C |is the number of nodes in the taxonomy.
Efficiently counting the hyponyms of a node re-
quires to break cycles that may occur in a WCG.
We perform a colored depth-first-search to detect cy-
cles, and break them as visualized in Figure 3. A
link pointing back to a node closer to the top of the
graph is deleted, as it violates the rule that links in
the WCG typically express hyponymy or meronymy
relations. If the cycle occurs between nodes on the
same level, we cannot decide based on that rule and
simply delete one of the links running on the same
level. This strategy never disconnects any nodes
from a connected component.

4.1 Datasets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999519375">
To create gold standard datasets for evaluation, hu-
man annotators are asked to judge the relatedness of
presented word pairs. The average annotation scores
are correlated with the SR values generated by a par-
ticular measure.
Several datasets for evaluation of semantic re-
latedness or semantic similarity have been created
so far (see Table 2). Rubenstein and Goodenough
(1965) created a dataset with 65 English noun pairs
(RG65 for short). A subset of RG65 has been
used for experiments by Miller and Charles (1991,
MC30) and Resnik (1995, Res30).
Finkelstein et al. (2002) created a larger dataset
for English containing 353 pairs (Fin353), that has
been criticized by Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003)
for being culturally biased. More problematic is that
Fin353 consists of two subsets, which have been an-
notated by a different number of annotators. We per-
formed further analysis of their dataset and found
that the inter-annotator agreement7 differs consider-
ably. These results suggest that further evaluation
based on this data should actually regard it as two
independent datasets.
As Wikipedia is a multi-lingual resource, we are
not bound to English datasets. Several German
datasets are available that are larger than the exist-
ing English datasets and do not share the problems
of the Finkelstein datasets (see Table 2). Gurevych
(2005) conducted experiments with a German trans-
lation of an English dataset (Rubenstein and Good-
enough, 1965), but argued that the dataset is too
small and only contains noun-noun pairs connected

summarized the values using a Fisher Z-value transformation.

ated a larger German dataset containing 350 word
pairs (Gur350). It contains nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives that are connected by classical and non-
classical relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004). How-
ever, word pairs for this dataset are biased to-
wards strong classical relations, as they were man-

used a semi-automatic process to create word pairs
from domain-specific corpora. The resulting ZG222
dataset contains 222 word pairs that are connected
by all kinds of lexical semantic relations. Hence, it
is particularly suited for analyzing the capability of

4.2 Results and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9632658">
Figure 4 gives an overview of our experimental re-
sults of evaluating SR measures based on the WCG
on three German datasets. We use Pearson’s prod-
uct moment correlation r to compare the results with
human judgments. From each dataset, we only use
word pairs where Wikipedia articles corresponding
to these words are available (see section 4.3 for a de-
tailed discussion of word pair coverage). For com-
parison, we give the best results obtained by Ger-
maNet based measures (abbreviated as GN).8
Our results show that the graph-based SR mea-
sures have been successfully transferred to the
WCG. Results on the Gur65 dataset (containing only
word pairs connected by strong classical relations)
are lower than values computed using GermaNet.
This is to be expected, as the WCG is created col-
laboratively without strictly enforcing a certain type

for each subset. It constitutes an upper bound of a measure’s

of semantic relation between categories, while Ger-
maNet is carefully modelled to represent the strong
classical relations captured by Gur65. Results on the
two other datasets, which contain a majority of word
pairs connected by non-classical semantic relations,
show that the WCG is better suited than GermaNet
to estimate SR.
Performance of WCG based measures depends on
the dataset and the kind of knowledge used. IIC
based measures (Res, JC and Lin) outperform path
based measures (PL, LC and WP) on the Gur65
dataset, while path based measures are clearly bet-
ter on SR datasets (Gur350 and ZG222). The im-
pressive performance of the simple PL measure on
the SR datasets cannot be explained with the struc-
tural properties of the WCG, as they are very similar
to those of other semantic networks. Semantically
related terms are very likely to be categorized un-
der the same category, resulting in short path lengths
leading to high SR. The generalization process that
comes along with classification seems to capture the
phenomenon of SR quite well. As each article can
have many categories, different kinds of semantic
relations between terms can be established, but the
type of relation remains unknown.

4.3 Coverage of Word Pairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991111">
If the WCG is to be used as a lexical semantic re-
source in large scale NLP applications, it should
provide broad coverage. As was described in sec-
tion 3.2, computing SR using the WCG relies on
categories assigned to articles. Thus, we consider
a word to be covered by the WCG, if there is a cate-
gorized article with matching title.
Table 3 gives an overview of the number of word
pairs covered in GermaNet or the WCG. Only few
words from Gur65 were not found in one of the re-
sources. This proportion is much higher for Gur350
and ZG222, as these datasets contain many domain
specific terms that are badly covered in GermaNet,
and many word pairs containing verbs and adjectives
that are badly covered in the WCG.9 A number of
word pairs (mostly containing combinations of verbs
or adjectives) were found neither in GermaNet nor

Wikipedia (see GN U WCG). If we consider only
noun-noun pairs (NN), the coverage of Wikipedia
exceeds that of GermaNet. The high proportion of
word pairs that are either only found in GermaNet
or in the WCG indicates that they are partially com-
plementary with respect to covered vocabulary.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981914285714">
In this paper, we performed a graph-theoretic anal-
ysis of the Wikipedia Category Graph and showed
that it is a scale-free, small-world graph, like other
semantic networks such as WordNet or Roget’s the-
saurus. From this result, we concluded that the
WCG can be used for NLP tasks, where other se-
mantic networks have been traditionally employed.
As Wikipedia is a multi-lingual resource, this en-
ables the transfer of NLP algorithms to languages
that do not have well-developed semantic wordnets.
To substantiate this claim, we described how mea-
sures of semantic relatedness operating on seman-
tic wordnets, like WordNet or GermaNet, can be
adapted to work on the WCG. We showed that the
WCG is well suited to estimate SR between words.
This is due to the categorization process that con-
nects terms which would not be closely related in
a taxonomic wordnet structure. Consequently, Ger-
maNet outperforms the WCG on the task of estimat-
ing semantic similarity. Furthermore, the WCG can-
not be used for tasks that require knowledge about
the exact type of semantic relation.
We performed an analysis of the coverage of
Wikipedia. It covers nouns very well, but is less
suited to compute semantic relatedness across parts-
of-speech. In this case, conventional semantic word-
nets are likely to provide a better knowledge source.
In Zesch et al. (2007b), we show that knowledge
from wordnets and from Wikipedia is complemen-
tary, and can be combined to improve the perfor-
mance on the SR task. As the simple PL measure
performs remarkably well on the SR datasets, in our
future work, we will also consider computing SR us-
ing the path length on the Wikipedia article graph
rather than on the WCG.

Averaging over all nodes gives the average degree k. The degree distribution P(k) is the probability that a random node will have degree k. In some graphs (like the WWW), the degree distribution follows a power law P(k) ^ k−γ (Barabasi and Albert, 1999). We use the power law exponent -y as a graph parameter.

The shortest path length L is the minimum of all these paths, i.e. Li,j = min l(pi,j). Averaging over all nodes gives the average shortest path length L. The diameter D is the maximum of the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.

In section 4, we evaluate the transferred algorithms with respect to correlation with human judgments on SR, and coverage. 3 Graph Based Semantic Relatedness Measures Semantic similarity (SS) is typically defined via the lexical relations of synonymy (automobile – car) and hypernymy (vehicle – car), while semantic relatedness (SR) is defined to cover any kind of lexical or functional association that may exist between two words (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). Dissimilar words can be semantically related, e.g. via functional relationships (night – dark) or when they are antonyms (high – low). Many NLP applications require knowledge about semantic relatedness rather than just similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).

As Wikipedia does not strictly enforce a taxonomic category structure, cycles and disconnected categories are possible, but rare. In the snapshot of the German Wikipedia3 from May 15, 2006, the largest connected component in the WCG contains 99,8% of all category nodes, as well as 7 cycles. In Wikipedia, each article can link to an arbitrary number of categories, where each category is a kind of semantic tag for that article. A category backlinks to all articles in this category. Thus, article graph and WCG are heavily interlinked (see Figure 1), and most studies (Capocci et al., 2006; Zlatic et al., 2006) have not treated them separately. However, the WCG should be treated separately, as it differs from the article graph.

The average annotation scores are correlated with the SR values generated by a particular measure. Several datasets for evaluation of semantic relatedness or semantic similarity have been created so far (see Table 2). Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) created a dataset with 65 English noun pairs (RG65 for short). A subset of RG65 has been used for experiments by Miller and Charles (1991, MC30) and Resnik (1995, Res30). Finkelstein et al.

More problematic is that Fin353 consists of two subsets, which have been annotated by a different number of annotators. We performed further analysis of their dataset and found that the inter-annotator agreement7 differs considerably. These results suggest that further evaluation based on this data should actually regard it as two independent datasets. As Wikipedia is a multi-lingual resource, we are not bound to English datasets.

Category graph Categories in Wikipedia are organized in a taxonomy-like structure (see left side of Figure 1 and Figure 2-a). Each category can have an arbitrary number of subcategories, where a subcategory is typically established because of a hyponymy or meronymy relation. For example, a category vehicle has subcategories like aircraft or watercraft. Thus, the WCG is very similar to semantic wordnets like WordNet or GermaNet (Kunze, 2004). As Wikipedia does not strictly enforce a taxonomic category structure, cycles and disconnected categories are possible, but rare.

Thus, she created a larger German dataset containing 350 word pairs (Gur350). It contains nouns, verbs and adjectives that are connected by classical and nonclassical relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004). However, word pairs for this dataset are biased towards strong classical relations, as they were manually selected. Thus, Zesch and Gurevych (2006) used a semi-automatic process to create word pairs from domain-specific corpora. The resulting ZG222 dataset contains 222 word pairs that are connected by all kinds of lexical semantic relations. Hence, it is particularly suited for analyzing the capability of a measure to estimate SR. 4.2 Results and Discussion Figure 4 gives an overview of our experimental results of evaluating SR measures based on the WCG on three German datasets.

E is a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices, called edges. Each page is treated as a node n, and each link between pages is modeled as an edge a running between two nodes.

For our analysis, we use a snapshot of the German Wikipedia from May 15, 2006. We consider only the largest connected component of the WCG that contains 99,8% of the nodes. Table 1 shows our results on the WCG as well as the corresponding values for other well-known graphs and lexical semantic networks. We compare our empirically obtained values with the values expected for a random graph. Following Zlatic et al. (2006), the cluster coefficient C for a random graph is Crandom = |V |k The average path length for a random network can be approximated as Lrandom ^ log |V |/ log k (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). From the analysis, we conclude that all graphs in Table 1 are small world graphs (see Figure 2-c). Small world graphs (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) contain local clusters that are connected by some long range links leading to low values of L and D. Thus, small world graphs are characterized by (i) small values of L (typically L &gt; Lrandom), together with (ii) large values of C (C » Crandom). Additionally, all semantic networks are scale-free graphs, as their degree distribution follows a power law.

Rada et al. (1989) use the path length (PL) between two nodes (measured in edges) to compute semantic relatedness. distPL = l(n1, n2) Leacock and Chodorow (1998, LC) normalize the path-length with the depth of the graph, l(n1, n2) simLC(n1, n2) = − log 2 x depth where depth is the length of the longest path in the graph. Wu and Palmer (1994, WP) introduce a measure that uses the notion of a lowest common subsumer of two nodes lcs(n1, n2). In a directed graph, a lcs is the parent of both child nodes with the largest depth in the graph. 2 depth(lcs) l(n1, lcs) + l(n2, lcs) + 2 depth(lcs) Resnik (1995, Res), defines semantic similarity between two nodes as the information content (IC) value of their lcs. He used the relative corpus frequency to estimate the information content value. Jiang and Conrath (1997, JC) additionally use the IC of the nodes. distJC(n1, n2) = IC(n1) + IC(n2) − 2IC(lcs) Note that JC returns a distance value i</context>

Thus, she created a larger German dataset containing 350 word pairs (Gur350). It contains nouns, verbs and adjectives that are connected by classical and nonclassical relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004). However, word pairs for this dataset are biased towards strong classical relations, as they were manually selected. Thus, Zesch and Gurevych (2006) used a semi-automatic process to create word pairs from domain-specific corpora.

Hence, it is particularly suited for analyzing the capability of a measure to estimate SR. 4.2 Results and Discussion Figure 4 gives an overview of our experimental results of evaluating SR measures based on the WCG on three German datasets.

Values for Actor (collaboration graph of actors in feature films), Power (the electrical power grid of the western United States) and C.elegans (the neural network of the nematode worm C. elegans) are from Watts and Strogatz (1998). Values for AN (a network of word associations by Nelson et al. (1998)), Roget’s thesaurus and WordNet are from Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005). Values for Wikiart (German Wikipedia article graph) are from Zlatic et al. (2006). We took the values for the page set labelled M on their website containing 190,099 pages for German, as it comes closest to a graph of only articles. Values marked with ‘-’ in the table were not reported in the studies. The values for the WCG are computed in this study. degree k of a node is the number of edges that are connected with this node. Averaging over all nodes gives the average degree k. The degree distribution P(k) is the probability that a random node will have degree k. In some graphs (like the WWW), the degree distribution follows a power law P(k) ^ k−γ (Barabasi and Albert, 19</context>

In a fully connected graph, the cluster coefficient is 1. 5In a social network, the cluster coefficient measures how many of my friends (neighboring nodes) are friends themselves. For our analysis, we use a snapshot of the German Wikipedia from May 15, 2006. We consider only the largest connected component of the WCG that contains 99,8% of the nodes. Table 1 shows our results on the WCG as well as the corresponding values for other well-known graphs and lexical semantic networks. We compare our empirically obtained values with the values expected for a random graph. Following Zlatic et al. (2006), the cluster coefficient C for a random graph is Crandom = |V |k The average path length for a random network can be approximated as Lrandom ^ log |V |/ log k (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). From the analysis, we conclude that all graphs in Table 1 are small world graphs (see Figure 2-c). Small world graphs (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) contain local clusters that are connected by some long range links leading to low values of L and D. Thus, small world graphs are characterized by (i) small values of L (typically L &gt; Lrandom), together with (ii) large values of C (C » Crandom). Additionally, all sem</context>
