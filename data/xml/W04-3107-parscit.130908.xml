The text mining community has shown significant impact for use of text mining in
drug discovery and basic research. So far, there have been a lot of point
solutions that have solved a particular problem or augmented a valuable
database. The next step is integrating text mining as part of the entire literature
analytic solution and delivering it effectively and comprehensively to support
research in academia, biotechs and pharmaceuticals.
