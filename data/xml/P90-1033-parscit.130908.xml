To achieve our goal of building a compre-
hensive lexical database out of various on-line
resources, it is necessary to interpret and
disambiguate the information found in these
resources. In this paper we describe a
Disambiguation Module which analyzes the
content of dictionary definitions, in particular,
definitions of the form &amp;quot;to VERB with Nr.
We discuss the semantic relations holding be-
tween the head and the &apos;Prepositional phrase in
such structures, as well as our heuristics for
identifying these relations and for
disambiguating the senses of the words in-
volved. We present some results obtained by
the Disambiguation Module and evaluate its
rate of success as compared with results ob-
tained from human judgements.

The goal of the Lexical Systems Group at
IBM&apos;s Watson Research Center is to create
COMPLEX, &amp;quot;a lexical knowledge base in
which word senses are identified, endowed
with appropriate lexical information and
properly related to one another&amp;quot; (Byrd 1989).
Information for COMPLEX is denvecl from
multiple lexical sources so senses in one source
need to be related to appropriate senses in the
other sources. Similarly, the senses of defining
words need to be disambiguated relative to the
senses supplied for them by the various
sources. (See Klavans et al, 1990.)
Sense-disambiguation of the words found
in dictionary entries can be viewed as a sub-
problem of sense-disambiguation of text
corpora in general, since dictionaries are large
corpora of phrases and sentences exhibiting a
variety of ambiguities, such as unresolved pro-
nominal references, attachment ambiguities,
and ellipsis. The resolution of these ambiguity
problems in the context of dictionary defi-
nitions would directly benefit their resolution
in other types of text. In order to solve the
problem of lexical.ambiguity in dictionary de-
finitions, we are investigating how to auto-
matically analyze the semantics of these
definitions and identify the relations holding
between genus and differentia. This paper
concentrates on one aspect of the task - the
semantics of one class of verb definitions.

I. DISAMBIGUATING DEFINITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995350020833334">
We have chosen to concentrate initially on
definitions of the form &amp;quot;to VERB with NP&amp;quot; in
Webster&apos;s 7th New Collegiate Dictionary
(Merriam 1963; henceforth W7).
Disambiguating these definitions consists of
identifying the appropriate sense of &amp;quot;with&apos;
(that is, the type of semantic relation linking
the VERB to the NP) and choosing, if possi-
ble, the appropriate senses of the VERB and
the NP-head from among all their W7 senses.
For example, the disambiguation of the defi-
nition of angle(3,v1,1), &amp;quot;to fish with a hook&amp;quot;,
determines that the relation between fish and
hook is use of instrument.&apos; It also determines
that the intended sense of fish is (vi,I)-&amp;quot;to at-
tempt to catch fish&amp;quot; and the intended sense of
hook is (n,1)-&amp;quot;a curved or bent implement for
catching, holding, or pulling&amp;quot;. )V7 lists 4
senses for intransitive fish and 4 for the noun
hook. Together with the five senses of with
(described in the next section), these yield 80
possible sense combinations for &amp;quot;to fish with a
hook&amp;quot;.
In addition to contributing to the creation
of COMPLEX, disambiguating strings of the
form &amp;quot;to VERB with NV&apos; also contributes to
the task of disambiguating prepositional
phrases in free text, an important problem in
lsiL processing. As is well known, parsing
prepositional phrases (PPs) in free text is
problematic because of the syntactic ambiguity
of their attachment. It is usually impossible to
determine on purely syntactic grounds which
head a given PP attaches to from among all
those that precede it in the sentence. Thus,
sentences like &amp;quot;the player hit the ball with the
bat&amp;quot; are usually parsed as syntactically ambig-
uous between &amp;quot;with the bat&amp;quot; as modifying the
verb and its modifying the noun.
One way to resolve the syntactic ambiguity
is to fisrt resolve the semantic ambiguity that
underlies it. To resolve it, we follow the ap-
proach proposed by Jensen &amp; &apos;Knot (1987)
and consult the dictionary definitions of the
words involved. This approach differs from
others that have been proposed for the
Thus we differ From other attempts at disambiguating definitions, (such as Mshawi 1987), which leave these &amp;quot;with&apos;
cases unresolved.

disambiguation of polysemous words in con-
text in that it accesses large published diction-
aries rather than hand-built knowledge bases
(as in Dalhgren &amp; McDowell 1989). More-
over, it parses the information retrieved from
the dictionary. Other approaches apply simple
string matches (Lesk 1987) or statistical meas-
ures (Amster &amp; Walker 1985). Consulting the
dictionary for &amp;quot;the player hit the ball with the
bat&amp;quot;, we identify &amp;quot;with the bat&amp;quot; as meaning,
among other things, the use of an implement
and &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; as a verb that can take a use modifier.
These potential meanings favor an attachment
of the PP to the verb. Furthermore, since no
semantic connection can be established be-
tween &apos;ball&amp;quot; and &apos;with the bat&amp;quot; based on the
dictionary, the likelihood of the verb attach-
ment increases.
Within this approach, we can view the
disambiguation of the text of dictionary defi-
nitions as a subgoal of the general
PP-attachment problem in free text. The
structure of sentences like &amp;quot;he hit the ball with
the bat&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;to VERB NP with NV&apos;, where
syntactic ambiguity arises between attachment
to the verb and attachment to the syntactic
object. These sentences differ from definition
strings, which have the form of &amp;quot;to VERB with
NP&amp;quot;, lacking a syntactic object. Even defi-
nitions of transitive verbs, which are headed
by transitive verbs, typically lack an object, as
in bat (vt,1)-&amp;quot;to strike or hit with or as if with
a bat&apos;. In the absence of an object, there is
no attachment ambiguity, since there is only
one head available (&amp;quot;strike or hit&amp;quot;). However,
semantic ambiguity still remains: lilt- means
both to strike and to score; &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; refers both
to a club and to an animal. We can view such
strings as cases where attachment has already
been resolved, and view their disambiguation
as an attempt to supply the semantic basis for
that attachment. Thus, obtaining the correct
semantic representation for cases where at-
tachment is known directly benefits cases
where attachment is ambiguous.
Our Disambiguation Module (henceforth
DM) selects the most appropriate sense
combination(s) in two parts: first, it tries to
identify the semantic categories or types de-
noted by each sense of the VERB and the
NP-head. It checks if the VERB denotes
change, affliction, an act of covering, marking
or providing. It tests whether the NP-head
reters to an implement, a part of some other
entity, a human being or group, an animal, a
body part, a feeling, state, movement, sound,
etc.2 Then it tries to identify the semantic re-
lation holding between the VERB and
NP-head. In the constructions we are inter-
ested in, the semantic relation between the two
terms depends not only on their semantic cat-
egories but also on the semantics of with,
which we discuss in the following section.3

2. THE MEANING OF WITH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999419254901961">
To investigate the semantics of with, we
turn to the linguistic literature on one hand
and to lexicographical sources on the other.
In the theoretical literature about prepositions
and PPs, a syntactic distinction is made be-
tween PPs as complements of predicates and
PPs as adjuncts. In traditional terms, a
complement-PP is &amp;quot;more closely related to the
[predicate], which determines its choice, than
to the prepositional complement&amp;quot; (Quirk et al.
1972). In current terms, complement-PPs are
determined by the predicate and listed in its
lexical (or thematic) entry, from which syntac-
tic structures are projected. To assure correct
projection, the occurrence of complements in
syntactic structures is subject to various con-
ditions of uniqueness and completeness
(Chomsky 1981; Bresnan 1982). Adjuncts, by
contrast, do not depend on the predicate.
They freely attach to syntactic structures as
modifiers and are not subject to these condi-
tions.
Although the syntactic distinction between
complements and adjuncts is assumed by
many theories, few provide criteria for deciding
whether a given PP is a complement or ad-
junct. (Exceptions are Larson (1988) and
Jackendoff (in preparation).) The theoretical
status of with is particularly interesting in this
context: It is generally agreed that some
with-PPs (such as those expressing manner)
are adjuncts and that others (like those occur-
ring with &amp;quot;spray/load&amp;quot; predicates) are comple-
ments; but there is disagreement about the
status of other classes, such as with-PPs ex-
pressing instruments. See Ravin (in press) for
a discussion of this issue.
The distinction between complements and
adjuncts bears directly on our disambiguation
problem, as we try to match it to our dis-
tinction between NP-based heuristics and
VERB-based ones (see Section 3). In turn, the
results provided by our DM put the various
theoretical hypotheses to test, by applying
them to a large amount of real data.
Dictionaries and other lexicographical
works typically explain the meaning of prep-
ositions in a collection of senses, some involv-
ing semantic descriptions and others expressing
usage comments. W7, for example, defines
with(1) semantically: &apos;in opposition to; against

<footnote confidence="0.9964656">
2 We have defined 16 semantic categories for nouns, so far. A most relevant question is how many such categories need
to be stipulated. For the purpose of the work reported here, these 16 categories suffice. Others, however, will be
needed for the disambiguation of other prepositions and other forms of ambiguity.
3 We concentrate here on with; however, preliminary work indicates that the treatment of other prepositions is quite
similar.

Chad a fight with his brother&apos;)&amp;quot;; it defines
sense 2 by a usage comment: &amp;quot;used as a func-
tion word to indicate one to whom a usu. re-
ciprocal communication is made (&amp;quot;talking with
a friend&amp;quot;)&amp;quot;. W7 lists a total of 12 senses for
with and various sub-senses. The Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English
(Longman 1978; henceforth LDOCE) lists 20.
Quirk et at. (1972) attempt to group the variety
of meanings under a few general categories,
such as means/instrument, accompaniment,
and having. Others (Boguraev &amp; Sparck Jones
1987, Collins 1987) offer somewhat different
divisions into main categories.
After reviewing the different characteriza-
tions of the meanings of with against a small
corpus of verb definitions containing with, we
have arrived at a set of five senses for it, cor-
responding to five semantic relations that can
hold between the VERB and the NP-head in
&amp;quot;to VERB with NP&amp;quot;. Since we are concerned
with verbs only, senses mentioned by our
sources for &amp;quot;NOUN with NP&amp;quot; were not in-
cluded (e.g., the &amp;quot;having&amp;quot; sense of Quirk et al.,
as in &amp;quot;a man with a red nose&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a woman
with a large family&amp;quot;). Moreover, we have ob-
served that certain common meanings of
&amp;quot;VERB with NP&amp;quot; fail to occur in dictionary
definitions. The accompaniment sense, for
example, as in &amp;quot;walk with Peter&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;drink with
friends&amp;quot;, was not found in our corpus of 300
definitio ns .4
The five senses which we have identified
are USE, MANNER, ALTERATION,
CO-AGENCY/PARTICIPATION, and
PROVISION, each including several smaller
sub-classes. Each sense is characterized by a
description of the states of affairs it refers to
and by some criteria which test it. As can be
expected, however, the criteria are not always
conclusive. There exist both unclear and
overlapping cases.
USE - examples are &amp;quot;to fish with a hook&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;to
obscure with a cloud&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;to surround with
an army&amp;quot;. With in this sense can usually be
paraphrased as &amp;quot;by means or or &amp;quot;using&amp;quot;. The
states of affairs in this categont involve three
participants: an agent (usually the missing
subject of the defirution), a patient (the missing
object) and the thing used (the referent of
&amp;quot;with NP&amp;quot;). The agent usually manipulates,
controls or uses the NP-referent and the
NP-referent remains distinct and apart from
the patient at the end of the action. The sub-
classes of USE are USE
-OF-INSTRUMENT, -OF-SUBSTANCE,
-OF-DODYPART,
-OF-ANIMATE _BEING, -OP-OBJECT.
MANNER - some examples are &amp;quot;to examine
with intent to verify&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;to anticipate with anx-
iety&amp;quot;; or &apos;to attack with blows or words&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;With NP&amp;quot; in this sense can be paraphrased
with an adverb (e.g., &apos;anxiously&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;violently&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;verbally&amp;quot;) and it describes the way in which
the agent acts. The MANNER sub-classes are
INTENTION-, SOUND-, MOTION-,
FEELING- or ATTITUDE-AS-MANNER.
The distinction between USE and MANNER
is usually quite straightforward but one class
of overlapping cases we have identified has to
do with verbal entities, such as &amp;quot;retort&apos; in &amp;quot;to
check or stop with a cutting retort&amp;quot;. Since
verbal entities are abstract, they can be viewed
as both being used by the agent as a type of
instrument and describing how the action is
performed.
ALTERATION - examples are &amp;quot;to mark with
bars&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;to impregnate with alcohol&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;to fill
with air&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;to strike with fear&amp;quot;. In some
cases, this sense can be paraphrased with
&amp;quot;make&amp;quot; and an adjective (e.g., &apos;make full&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;make afraid&amp;quot;); in others, with &amp;quot;put into/onto&amp;quot;
(e.g., &amp;quot;put air into&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;put marks onto&amp;quot;). The
states of affairs are ones in which change oc-
curs in the patient and the NP-referent remains
close to the patient or even becomes part of it.
The sub-classes are ALTERATION
-BY-MARKING, -BY-COVERING,
-BY-AFFLICTION, and CAUSAL ALTER-
ATION. Cases of overlap between ALTER-
ATION and USE are abundant. &amp;quot;To spatter
with some discoloring substance&amp;quot; is an exam-
ple of creating a change in the patient while
using a substance. The definition of spatter
itself indicates this overlap: &amp;quot;to splash with or
as if with a liquid; also to spoil in this way&amp;quot;.
CO-AGENCY or PARTICIPATION - as in
&amp;quot;to combine with other parts&amp;quot;. Such strings
can be paraphrased with &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;one part and
other parts combine&amp;quot;). The state of affairs is
one in which there are two agents or partic-
ipants sharing relatively equally in the event.
PROVISION - as in &amp;quot;to fit with clothes&amp;quot;; and
&amp;quot;to furnish with an alphabet&amp;quot;. This sense can
be paraphrased with &apos;give (and sometimes
with &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;to furnish an alphabet to&amp;quot;), and it
applies to states of affairs where the
NP-referent is given to somebody by the agent.
In addition to the five semantic meanings
discussed above, there is also one purely syn-
tactic function, PHRASAL, which with fulfills
in verb-preposition combinations, such as &apos;in-
vest with. authority&amp;quot;. It can be argued that with
in such cases simply serves to link the NP to
the VERB.
The DM disambiguates a given string by
classifying it as an instance of one of these six
categories, and thus selecting the appropriate
sense combination of the words in the string.

3. THE DISAMBIGUATION PROCESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970854700855">
The DM is an extended and modified ver-
sion of an earlier prototype developed by
Jensen and Binot for the resolution of
prepositional-phrase attachment ambiguities
(Jensen &amp; Burnt 1987). It uses a syntactic
parser, PEG (Jensen 1986), and a body of se-
mantic heuristics which operate on the parsed
dictionary definitions of the terms to be
disambiguated. The first step in the
disambiguation process is parsing the ambig-
uous string (e.g., &amp;quot;to fish with a hook&apos;) by
PEG and identifying the two relevant terms,
the VERB and NP-head (fish and hook).
Next, each of these terms is looked up in W7,
its definitions are retrieved and also parsed by
PEG. Heuristics then apply to the parsed de-
finitions of the terms to determine their se-
mantic categories. The heuristics contain a set
of lexical and syntactic conditions to identify
each semantic category. For example, the I
STRUMENT heuristic for nouns checks if the
head of the parsed definition is &amp;quot;instrument&amp;quot;,
implement&apos;, &apos;device ,&amp;quot;tool&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weapon&amp;quot;; if
the head is &amp;quot;part&amp;quot;, post-modified by an of-pp,
whose object is &amp;quot;instrument&amp;quot;, Implement&apos;,
etc.; if the head is post-modified by the
participial &amp;quot;used as a weapon&amp;quot;; etc.. If any of
these conditions apply, that sense of the noun
is marked + INSTRUMENT.&apos;
Next, each of the possible with-relations is
tried. Let us take USE as a first example. To
determine whether a USE relation holds in a
particular string, the DM considers the se-
mantic category of the NP-head. The most
typical case is when the NP-head is + IN-
STRUMENT, as in &amp;quot;to fish with a hook&amp;quot;. In
this case, the relationship of USE is further
supported by a link established between the
NP-head definition and the VERB definition
through catch: a hook is an&amp;quot;... implement for
catching, holding, or pulling&amp;quot; and to fish is &amp;quot;to
attempt to catch fish&amp;quot;. (See Jensen &amp; Binot
1987 for similar examples and discussion.)
Such a link, however, is rarely found. In many
other USE instances, it is the meaning of the
NP-head alone that determines the relation.
Thus, DM determines that USE applies to &amp;quot;to
attack with bombs&apos; based on bomb(n,1)-&amp;quot;an
explosive device fused to detonate under speci-
fied conditions&apos;, although no link is established
between attack and detonate.
USE is also applied regardless of the VERB
when the NP-head is + BODYPART and
certain syntactic conditions (a definite article
or a 3rd-person possessive pronoun) hold of
the string, as in &amp;quot;to strike or push with or as if
with the head&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to write with one&apos;s own
hand&amp;quot;. USE is similarly assigned if the
NP-head is + SUBSTANCE: &amp;quot;to rub with oil
or an oily substance&apos; or &amp;quot;to kill especially with
poison&amp;quot;. MANNER, like USE, is also deter-
mined largely on the basis of the NP-head. It
is assigned if the semantic category of the
NP-head is a state (&amp;quot;to progress with much
tacking or difficulty&amp;quot;); a feeling (&amp;quot;to dispute
with zeal, anger or heat&amp;quot;); a movement (&amp;quot;to
move with a swaying or swinging motion&amp;quot;); an
intention (&amp;quot;to examine with intent to verify&amp;quot;);
etc.
Since USE and MANNER are largely de-
termined on the basis of the semantic category
of the NP, they correspond to adjuncts, in the
theoretical distinction made between adjuncts
and complements. By contrast, AL MR-
ATio N, CO-AGENCY and PROVISION are
determined mostly on the basis of the VERB
and could be said to correspond to comple-
ments. (There are, however, many compli-
cations with this simple division, which we are
currently studying.) To assign an ALTER-
ATION relation to a string, the DM checks
whether the VERB subcategorizes for an (op-
tional) with-complement, based on informa-
tion found in the online version of LDOCE
and whether the VERB denotes change. The
first LDOCE sense of fill, &apos;to make or become
full&amp;quot;, for example, fulfills both conditions.
Therefore, ALTERATION is assigned in &amp;quot;to
become filled with or as if with air&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to fill
with detrital material&apos; and &apos;to become tilled
with painful yearning&apos;. ALTERATION also
applies to other verb classes that are not
marked for with-subcategorization in
LDOCE, such as verbs denoting affliction (&amp;quot;to
overcome with fear or dread&amp;quot;) or actions of
marking (&amp;quot;to mark with an asterisk&amp;quot;). Finally,
PHRASAL is assigned if a separate LDOCE
entry exists for &amp;quot;VERB with&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;to charge
with a crime&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to ply with drink&amp;quot;.
PHRASAL indicates that the semantic relation
between the VERB and the NP is not re-
stricted by the meaning of with but is more like
the relation between a verb and its direct ob-
ject.
Since the heuristics for each semantic re-
lation are independent of each other, conflict-
ing interpretations may arise. There are cases
of unresolved ambiguity, when different senses
of one of the terms give rise to different inter-
pretations. For example, &amp;quot;to write with one&apos;s
own hand&amp;quot; receives a USE
(-OF-BODYPART) interpretation but also a
USE (-OF-ANIMATE BEING), which is in-
correct but due to several W7 senses of hand
which are marked + HUMAN (&amp;quot;one who
performs or executes a particular work&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;one
employed at manual labor or general tasks&amp;quot;;
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4760755">
5 The heuristics appEy to each definition in isolation, retrieving information that is static and unchanging. In the future,
we intend to apply the heuristics to the whole dictionary and store the information in COMPLEX.

&amp;quot;worker, employee&amp;quot;, etc.). A general heuristic
can be added to prefer a + BODYPART in-
terpretation over a + HUMAN one, since this
ambiguity occurs with other body parts too.
Other instances of ambiguity, however, are
more idiosyncratic. &amp;quot;To utter with accent&apos;, for
example, receives a MANNER interpretation
(correct), based on accent(n,I)-&amp;quot;a distinctive
manner of usually oral expression&amp;quot;; but it also
receives USE(-0E-SUBSTANCE) (incorrect),
based on accent(n,7,c)-&amp;quot;a substance or object
used for emphasis&amp;quot;. General heuristics cannot
eliminate all cases of ambiguities of this kind.
Another type of conflict arises when one
semantic relation is assigned on the basis of the
VERB while another is assigned on the basis
of the NP-head. This is the case with &amp;quot;to
overcome with fear or dread&amp;quot;, for which the
DM returns two interpretations: ALTER-
ATION (correct) because the verb denotes af-
fliction and MANNER (incorrect) because the
NP denotes a mental attitude. For &amp;quot;to com-
bine or impregnate with ammonia or an
ammonium compound&amp;quot; DM similarly returns
ALTERATION (correct) because the verb is
a causative verb of change and
USE(-0E-SUBSTANCE) (incorrect) because
the NP refers to a chemical substance. To
handle this type of conflict, we have imple-
mented a &amp;quot;final preference&amp;quot; heuristic which
chooses the VERB-based interpretation over
the NP-based one. Note, however, that this
heuristic has implications for cases of overlap,
such as &amp;quot;spatter with a discoloring substance&amp;quot;,
discussed above. When DM generates both
the VP-based ALTERATION link and the
NP-based link of USE for this string, the for-
mer would be preferred over the latter. Thus
the fact that both links truly apply in this case
will be lost.
A third possible conflict arises between a
PHRASAL interpretation and a semantic one.
The DM returns PHRASAL-VERB (correct)
and ALTERATION (incorrect) for &amp;quot;to charge
with a crime&amp;quot;, based on charge with-&amp;quot;(espe-
cially of an official or an official group) to
bnng a charge against (someone) for (some-
thing wrong); accuse or; and charge(with)-&amp;quot;to
(cause to) take in the correct amount of elec-
tricity&amp;quot;. Since the existence of a PFIRASAL
interpretation is an idiosyncratic property of
verbs, there is no general heuristic for solving
conflicts of this kind.

strings vary as can be seen from the following

vigor, craft, or resources&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;to prevent from in-
terfering with each other (as by a baffler
However, since we submit the strings to the
PEG parser and retrieve the VERB and
NP-head from the parsed structures, we are
able to abstract over most of the variations.
Currently, the DM ignores multiple conjuncts
in coordinate structures and considers only one
VERB and one NP-head. In the future, all
possible pairings should be considered (e.g.
&amp;quot;contend with strength&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;contend with vigor,
&apos;contend with craft&apos;, and so on, for the exam-
ple mentioned above) and the results should
be combined. As mentioned in Section 1, de-
finition strings lack a syntactic object. The few
strings that contain an object include it in pa-
rentheses (lo treat (flour) with nitrogent
trichloride&amp;quot;). This, again, is tolerated by the
PEG parser, and allows us to assume that in
all the strings the with-phrase attaches to the
VERB rather than to the object.
The DM results can be summarized as fol-
lows: The correct&apos; semantic relation, based on
the appropriate semantic category (of the
NP-head or VERB), is assigned to 113 out of
the 170 strings. Here are a few examples:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.360350285714286">
sever with an ax
USE(-0E-INSTRUMENT)
wet with blood
USE(-0E-SUBSTANCE)
inter with full ceremonies
(ACTION-AS-) MANNER
dispute with zeal
(ATTITUDE-AS-) MANNER
ornament with ribbon
ALTERATION (BY-COVERING)
clothe with rich garments
ALTERATION (BY-COVERING)
equip with weapons
PROVISION
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987559253164557">
We consider these 113 results to be completely
satisfactory.
In a second group of cases, the correct se-
mantic relation, based on the appropriate se-
mantic category, is one of 2 (and rarely of 3)
semantic relations assigned to the string. There
are 15 such cases. Here are two examples:
harass with dogs
USE(-0E-ANIMATE BEING) correct
USE(-0E-INSTRUMENT) incorrect
The second interpretation is due to
dog(n,3,a.)-&amp;quot;any of various usually simple me-
chanical devices for holding, gripping, or fas-
tening consisting of a spike, rod, or bar&amp;quot;.
Lacking information about the frequency of
different senses of words, we have at present
no principled way to distinguish a primary
sense (like the animal sense of dog) from more
obscure senses (like the device sense).
Make dirty with grime
USE(-0E-S U BSTA NC E) correct
(STATE-AS) MANNER incorrect
The incorrect interpretation of grime as man-
ner is due to the definition of its hypernym
dirtiness as &apos;the quality or state of being dirty&apos;.
We consider this second group of cases, which
are assigned two interpretations, to be partial
successes, since they represent an improvement
over the initial number of possible sense com-
binations even if they do not fully
disambiguated them.
In 37 cases, DM is unable to assign any
interpretation. One reason is failure to identify
the semantic category of the VERB or
NP-head. For example, to pronounce with a
burr&amp;quot; should be assigned MANNER
(SOUND), but the relevant definitions of burr
read: &amp;quot;a trilled uvular r as used by some
speakers of English especially in northern En-
gland and in Scotland&apos; and &amp;quot;a tongue-point
trill that is the usual Scottish r-, making it im-
possible for DM to identify it as a sound. (See
discussion below) There are other reasons for
failure: occasionally the NP-head is not listed
as an entry in W7 as barking in &amp;quot;to pursue
with barking&amp;quot; or drunkenness in &amp;quot;to muddle
with drunkenness or infatuation&apos;. Even if we
introduced morphological rules, identified the
base of the derivational word and looked up
the meaning of the base, the derived meaning
in these cases would still not be obvious.
Finally, a negligible number of failures is due
to incorrect parsing by PEG, which in turn
provides incorrect input for the heuristics.
Failure to assign any interpretation does
not, of course, count as success; but it does not
produce much harm either. Far more danger-
ous than no assignment is the assignment .of
one incorrect interpretation, since incorrect in-
terpretations cannot be differentiated from
correct ones in any general or automatic way.
Out of the set of 170 strings, only 5 are as-
signed a single incorrect interpretation. These
are:
press with requests
(STATE-AS-) MANNER
based on the fourth definition of request: &amp;quot;the
state of being sought after; demand&amp;quot;.
Seize with teeth
ALTERATION (BY-AFFLICTION)
based on seize(vt,5,a)-&amp;quot;to attack or overwhelm
physically; afflict&amp;quot;.
Speak with a burr
USE(-0E-INSTRUMENT)
based on burr(n,2,b,1)-&amp;quot;a small rotary cutting
tool&amp;quot;.
where the semantic relation may seem correct,
but the sense of light on which it is based (&amp;quot;a
flame for lighting something&apos;) is inappropriate.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4941895">
Possess with a devil
USE(-0E-ANIMATE BEING)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.980408126506024">
where the intended semarTtic relation is unclear
(ALTERATION?) as is the semantic category
of devil. However, the USE interpretation is
clearly based on the several inappropriate
+ HUMAN senses of devil (&amp;quot;an extremely and
malignantly wicked person : fiend&amp;quot;; &apos;a person
of notable energy, recklessness, and clashing
spirit&amp;quot;; and others).
As incorrect interpretations cannot be au-
tomatically identified as such, it is most im-
portant to design .the heuristics so that they
generate as few incorrect interpretations as
possible. One way of restricting the heuristics
is by not considering the meaning of
hypernyms, except in special cases. To return
to &amp;quot;pronounce with a burr&amp;quot;. We prefer to miss
the fact that a burr, which is a trill, is a sound
by ignoring the meaning of the hypernym trill
than to have to take into account the meaning
of all the hypernyms of burr. Considering the
meaning of all the hypemy.ms will yield too
many incorrect semantic interpretations for
&amp;quot;pronounce with a burr&amp;quot;. One hypernym of
burr, weed, has a + HUMAN sense and a
+ ANIMAL sense; ridge, another hypernym,
has a + BODYPART sense.
Since results obtained with the training
corpus were promising, we ran DM on a test-
ing corpus: 132 definitions of the form &amp;quot;to
VERB with NP&amp;quot; not processed by the pro-
gram before. The results obtained with the
testing corpus are compared below with those
of the training corpus. The first column lists
the total number of strings; the second, the
number of strings assigned a single, correct in-
terpretation; the third, the number of strings
assigned two interpretations, one of which is
correct; the fourth column shows the number
of strings for which no interpretation was
found, and the last column lists the number
of strings assigned one or more incorrect in-
terpretations (but no correct ones).
TOT COR 1/2 0 INC
TRAINING 170 113 15 37 5
TESTING 132 75 13 22 22
To measure the coverage of DM, we calculate
the ratio of strings interpreted (correctly and
incorrectly) to the total number of strings:
COVERAGE RATIO
TRAINING 133/170 (or 78.2%)
TESTING 110/132 (or 83.3%)
To measure the reliability of DM, we calculate
the ratio of correct interpretations to incorrect
ones:
Suffuse with light USE 265
COR-TO-INC RATIO
TRAINING 113/133 (or 85%)
TESTING 75/110 (or 68%)
If we include in the correct category those
strings for which two interpretations were
found (only one of which is correct), the reli-
ability measure increases:
COR+ 112-TO-INC RATIO
TRAINING 128/133 (or 96.2%)
TESTING 88/110 (or 80%)
As expected, reliability for the testing material
is lower than for the training set. This is due
to the several iterations of fine-tuning to which
the training corpus has been subjected. The
examination of the testing results suggests
some further fine-tuning, which is currently
being &apos;implemented, and which will reduce the
number of incorrect interpretations.
Finally, we developed a criterion by which
to measure the accuracy of our judgements of
correctness. To ensure that our personal
judgements of the correctness of the DM in-
terpretations as reported above were neither
idiosyncratic nor favorably biased, we com-
pared them with the judgements of other hu-
man subjects, both linguists and non-linguists.
We randomly selected 58 definition strings
whose interpretation we judged to be correct
and assigned each of them to 3-4 different
participants for their judgements. Participants
were asked to perform the same task as the
module&apos;s, namely, for each definition string,
select the relevant with-link from among the
six we have stipulated and choose the relevant
senses of the VERB and the NP-head from
among all their W7 senses. We provided short
explanations of the different with-links (based
on the descriptions found here in Section 2)
with a few examples. We allowed participants
to choose more than one link if necessary, so
that we can detect cases of overlap; we also
allowed the choice of OTHER, if no link
seemed suitable; or a question mark, if the
siring seemed confusing.
In 3 cases there was no consensus among
the human judgements. Either 4 different
choices of with-links or two question marks
were given, as shown below:
Affect with a blighting influence
USE, PHRASAL,
ALTERATION/PHRASAL,?
Fill with bewildered wonder
PROVISION, PHRASAL,
ALTERATION, MANNER
tit to or with a stock
PROVISION, USE, ?, ?
Even though the DM choice for these strings
(deemed correct by us) coincided with one of
the human choices, the variation is too large
to validate the correctness of this choice.
These 3 cases were therefore ignored.
En 44 cases out of the remaining 55, there
was (almost) unanimous agreement (3 or 4)
among the human judgements on a single
with-link. The DM choice was identical to 41
of those 44. That is, in 41 out of 44 cases, our
own judgement of correctness coincides with
that of others. The cases where we differ are:
flavor, blend, or preserve with brandy
4 subjects out of 4: ALTERATION
DM: USE
face or endure with courage
2 subjects out of 3: MANNER
third subject: MANNER/USE
DM: USE
strengthen with or as if with buckram
4 subjects out of 4: ALTERATION
DM: USE
In the remaining 11 strings, there was an even
split in the human judgements between two
with-links, indicative to some extent of genuine
overlap. For example, treat with a bromate&amp;quot;
was interpreted as USE by two participants
and as ALTERATION by two others. One
participant explained that his choice depended
on the implied object: he would categorize
treating a patient with medicine as USE but
treating a metal with a chemical substance as
ALTERATION. The DM choice was identi-
cal to one of the two alternative human
choices in 10 out of these 11 strings. That is,
in 10 out of 11 cases, our judgement of cor-
rectness fits one of the two choices made by
others.
To summarize, our judgements of correct-
ness were validated by others in 51 cases out
of 56 (or 91 %).Our practical conclusion from
this experiment is simply that our semantic
judgements concerning the meaning of with in
context coincides with those of others often
enough to allow us to rely on our intuitions
when informally evaluating the results of our
program.. More generally, this experiment
seems to indicate that people reach consensus
on the meaning of prepositions once they are
given a set of alternatives to choose from, even
though they may find it very difficult to define
the meaning of prepositions themselves. The
significance of the unclear cases and the over-
lap cases in the experiment requires further
study.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999878">
As our evaluations indicate, the DM
which we are developing is quite successful in
identifying the correct semantic relation that
holds between the terms of a definition string.
In identifying this relation, the DM also par-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991192">
266
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965911764706">
tinily disambiguates the senses of the definition
terms. In assigning MANNER, for example,
to &amp;quot;utter with accent&amp;quot;, DM selects two senses
of accent as relevant, from among the nine
listed in its W7 entry. In assigning ALTER-
ATION to &amp;quot;mark with a written or printed
accent&amp;quot;, it selects 3 completely different senses
of accent as relevant. &apos;Thus, the same noun
(accent), occurring in identical syntactic struc-
tures (&amp;quot;VERB with NP&amp;quot;) is assigned different
sense(s), based on its semantic link to its head.
Interpreting the semantic relations between
genus and differentia and disambiguating the
senses of defining terms are both crucial for
our general goal - the creation of a compre-
hensive, yet disambiguated, lexical database.
There are other important applications: the
heuristics that have been developed for the
analysis of dictionary definitions should be
helpful in the disambiguation of PPs occurring
in free text, In cases of syntactic ambiguity,
the need to determine proper attachment is
evident. In addition, we should point out that
there is a need to identify the semantic relation
between a head and a PP, even when attach-
ment is clear. In translation, for example, re-
solving the semantic ambiguity of a source
preposition is needed when ambiguity cannot
be preserved in the target preposition. Finally,
we hope that the computational
disambiguation of the meanings of prep-
ositions will contribute interesting insights to
the linguistic issues concerning the distinction
between adjuncts and complements.

In this paper we describe a Disambiguation Module which analyzes the content of dictionary definitions, in particular, definitions of the form &amp;quot;to VERB with Nr. We discuss the semantic relations holding between the head and the &apos;Prepositional phrase in such structures, as well as our heuristics for identifying these relations and for disambiguating the senses of the words involved.

(1972) attempt to group the variety of meanings under a few general categories, such as means/instrument, accompaniment, and having. Others (Boguraev &amp; Sparck Jones 1987, Collins 1987) offer somewhat different divisions into main categories. After reviewing the different characterizations of the meanings of with against a small corpus of verb definitions containing with, we have arrived at a set of five senses for it, corresponding to five semantic relations that can hold between the VERB and the NP-head in &amp;quot;to VERB with NP&amp;quot;.

In order to solve the problem of lexical.ambiguity in dictionary definitions, we are investigating how to automatically analyze the semantics of these definitions and identify the relations holding between genus and differentia. This paper concentrates on one aspect of the task - the semantics of one class of verb definitions. I. DISAMBIGUATING DEFINITIONS We have chosen to concentrate initially on definitions of the form &amp;quot;to VERB with NP&amp;quot; in Webster&apos;s 7th New Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam 1963; henceforth W7). Disambiguating these definitions consists of identifying the appropriate sense of &amp;quot;with&apos; (that is, the type of semantic relation linking the VERB to the NP) and choosing, if possible, the appropriate senses of the VERB and the NP-head from among all their W7 senses. For example, the disambiguation of the definition of angle(3,v1,1), &amp;quot;to fish with a hook&amp;quot;, determines that the relation between fish and hook is use of instrument.&apos; It also determines that the intended sense of fish is (vi,I)-&amp;quot;to attempt to catch fish&amp;quot; and the intended sense of hook is (n,1)-&amp;quot;a curved or bent impl</context>
