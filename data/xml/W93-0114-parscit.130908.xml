In this paper, we describe the most recent
implementation and evaluation of the proper noun
categorization and standardization module of the DR..
LINK document detection system being developed at
Syracuse University, under the auspices of ARPA&apos;s
TIPSTER program. We also discuss the expansion of
group common nouns and group proper nouns to
enhance retrieval recall. Successful proper noun
boundary identification within the part of speech tagger
is essential for successful categorization. The proper
noun classification module is designed to assign a
category code to each proper noun entity, using 30
categories generated from corpus analysis.
Standardization of variant proper nouns occurs at three
levels of processing. Expansion of group proper nouns
and group common nouns is performed on queries.
Standardization and categorization is performed on
queries and documents. DR-LINK&apos;s overall precision
for proper noun categorization was 93%, based on 589
proper nouns occurring in the evaluation set.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921620689655">
In information retrieval, proper nouns, group proper
nouns, and group common nouns present unique
problems. Proper nouns are recognized as an important
source of information for detecting relevant documents
in information retrieval and extracting contents from a
text (Rau, 1991). Yet most of the unknown words in
texts which degrade the performance of natural language
processing information retrieval systems are proper
nouns. Group proper nouns (e.g., Middle East) and
group common nouns (e.g., third world) will not match
on their constituents unless the group entity is
mentioned in the document. The proper noun processor
herein described is a module in the DR-LINK system
(Liddy et al, in press) for document detection being
developed under the auspices of ARPA&apos;s TIPSTER
program.
Our approach to solving the group common noun and
the group proper noun problem has been to expand the
appropriate terms in a query, such as &apos;third world,&apos; to all
possible names and variants of third world entities. For
all proper nouns, our system assigns categories from a
proper noun classification scheme to every proper noun
in both documents and queries to permit proper noun
matching at the category level. Category matching is
more efficient than keyword matching if the query
requires entities of a particular type. Standardization
provides a means of efficiently categorizing and
retrieving documents containing variant forms of a
proper noun.

2. Proper Noun Boundary
Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996869">
In our most recent implementation, which has improved
from our initial attempt (Paik et al, in press),
documents are first processed using a probabilistic part
of speech tagger (Meeter et al, 1991). Then a proper
noun boundary identifier utilizes proper noun part of
speech tags from the previous stage to bracket adjacent
proper nouns. Additionally, heuristics developed
through corpus analysis are applied to bracket proper
noun phrases with embedded conjunctions and
prepositions as one unit. For example, a list of proper
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999627">
154
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917782608696">
nouns will be bracketed with non-adjacent proper nouns,
if &apos;of is an embedded preposition. Some examples of
preceding proper nouns include Council, Ministry,
Secretary, University, etc.
The success of ratio of our proper noun boundary
identification module is approximately 96% in
comparison to our initial system&apos;s 95% (Paik et al, in
press). This improvement was achieved by the re-
ordering of the data flow. A general-purpose phrase
bracketter, which was applied before the proper noun
boundary identification heuristics for non-adjacent
proper nouns, is now applied to texts after all the proper
noun categorization and standardization steps. Thus, we
have eliminated one major source of error, which is the
conflict between the general-purpose noun phrase
bracketter and the proper noun boundary identification
heuristics. For example, embedded prepositions in a
proper noun phrase are sometimes recognized as the
beginnings of prepositional phrases by the general-
purpose phrase bracketter. The remaining 3% of error is
due mainly to incorrect proper noun tags assigned to the
uncommon first word of a sentence by the part of
speech tagger.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.94634" genericHeader="method">
3. Proper Noun Classification Scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985070175439">
Our proper noun classification scheme, which was
developed through corpus analysis of newspaper texts,
is organized as a hierarchy which consists of 9
branching nodes and 30 terminal nodes. Currently, we
use only the terminal nodes to assign categories to
proper nouns in texts. Based on an analysis of 588
proper nouns from a set of randomly selected documents
from Wall Street Journal, we found that our 29
meaningful categories correctly accounted for 89% of all
proper nouns in texts. We reserve the last category as a
miscellaneous category. Figure 1 shows a hierarchical
view of our proper noun categorization scheme.
The system categorizes all identified proper nouns using
several methods. The first approach is to compare the
proper noun with a list of all identified prefixes, infixes
and suffixes for possible categorization based on these
lexical clues. If the system cannot identify a category
in this stage, the proper noun is passed to an alias
database to determine if the proper noun has an alternate
name form. If this is the case, the proper noun is
standardized and categorized at this point. If there is no
match in the alias database, the proper noun moves to
the knowledge-base look up. These databases have been
constructed using online lexical resources including the
Gazetteer, the World Factbase, and the Executive Desk
Reference. If the knowledge-base look up is not
successful, the proper noun is run through a context
hueristics application developed from corpus analysis,
which suggests certain categories of proper nouns. For
example, if a proper noun is followed by a comma and
another proper noun, which has been identified as a
state, we will label the proper noun as a city name,
e.g., Time, Illinois. Finally, if the proper noun has
still not been categorized, it is compared against a list
of first names generated from the corpus for a final
personal name categorization check. If the proper noun
has not been categorized at this stage, it will be labeled
with the &apos;miscellaneous&apos; category code.
For the categorization system to work efficiently,
variant terms must be standardized. This procedure is
performed at three levels, with the prefixes, infixes and
suffixes standardized first. Next, the proper nouns in
alias forms are standardized into the official form where
available. These standardization techniques improve the
retrieval performance. Finally, if a proper noun was
mentioned at least twice in a document, for instance,
Analog Devices, Inc. and later as Analog Devices, a
partial string match of a proper noun is co-indexed for
reference resolution. This technique allows for a full
representation of a proper noun entity. Figure 2
illustrates the flow of the proper noun categorization
system within the first stages of DR-LINK processing.
When standardization and categorization have been
completed, a new field is added to both the query and the
document containing the proper noun and the
corresponding category codes. These fields are then used
for efficient matching and representation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.487235">
4. Use of Proper Nouns in Matching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951529411765">
Both the lexical entry for the proper noun or the
category code may be used for matching documents to
queries. For example, if a query is about a boarder
incursion, we can limit the potentially relevant
documents to those documents which contain at least
two different country names, flagged by the two country
category codes in the proper noun field. Using the
standardized form of a proper noun reduces the number
of possible variants which the system would otherwise
need to search for.
While the category matching strategy is useful in many
cases, an expansion of a group proper noun such as
&apos;European Community&apos;, which occurs in a query, to
member country names is also beneficial. Relevant
documents for a query about sanctions against Japan by
European Community countries are likely to mention
actions against Japan by member countries by name

rather than the term in the query, European
Community. We are currently using a proper noun
expansion database with 168 expandable entries for
query processing. In addition, certain common nouns or
noun phrases in queries such as &apos;socialist countries&apos; need
to be expanded to the names of the countries which
satisfy the definition of the term to improve
performance in detecting relevant documents. The
system consults a list of common nouns and noun
phrases which can be expanded into proper nouns and
actively searches for these terms during the query
processing stage. Currently, the common noun
expansion database has 37 entries.
The creation and use of proper noun information is first
utilized in the DR-LINK system as an addition to the
subject-content based filtering module which uses a
scheme of 122 subject field codes (SFCs) from a
machine readable dictionary rather than keywords to
represent documents. Although SFC representation and
matching provides a very good first level of document
filtering, not all proper nouns reveal subject
information, so the proper noun concepts in texts are
not actually represented in the SFC vectors.
In our new implementation, categorized and standardized
proper nouns are combined with Text Structure (Liddy
et al, in press-b) information for matching queries
against documents. Text Structure is a recognition of a
discernible, predictable schema of texts of a particular
type. The Text Structurer module in the DR-LINK
system delineates the discourse-level organization of
document content so that processing at later stages can
focus on those components identified by the Text
Structurer as being the most likely location in the
document where the information requested in a query is
to be found.
All proper nouns in a document collection are indexed
in an inverted file with the document accession number,
the Text Structure component in which the proper noun
was located, and the category code. For processing the
queries for their proper noun requirements, we have
developed a Boolean criteria script which determines
which proper nouns or combinations of proper nouns
are needed from certain Text Structure components in
each query. These requirements are then run against the
proper noun inverted file to rank documents according to
the extent to which they match these requirements.
Also, the categorization information of proper nouns is
currently used in a later module of the system, which
extracts concepts and relations from text to produce a
more refined representation. For example, proper nouns
may reveal the location of a company or the nationality
of an individual.
We do not have information retrieval evaluation results
based on the new implementation using the proper noun
information in conjunction with the Text Structure
information. However, in previous testing of our
initial system which did not utilize Text Structure
information (Paik et at, in press), reranking of
documents received from the SFC module, based on the
degree of proper noun requirements matching a set of
queries against a document collection, resulted in
placing all the relevant documents within the top 28%
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.9994845">

<bodyText confidence="0.9999944">
of the document collection. It should also be noted that
the precision figures on the output of the SFC module
plus the proper noun matching module produced very
reasonable precision results (.22 for the 11-point
precision average), even though the combination of
these two modules was never intended to function as a
stand-alone retrieval system.
Finally, the proper noun extraction and categorization
module, although developed as part of the DR-LINK
system, could be used to provide improved document
representation for any information retrieval system.
The standardization and categorization features permit
queries and documents to be matched with greater
precision, while the expansion functions of group
proper nouns and group common nouns improve recall.

5. Performance Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999366875">
While we are currently processing more than one
gigabyte of text using the new version of the proper
noun categorizer for the TIPSTER 24 month testing,
the evaluation of the proper noun categorizer herein
reported is based on 25 randomly selected Wall Street
Journal documents, which were compared to the proper
noun categorization done by a human. This document
set was also used in evaluating our initial version of the
categorizer (Paik et al, in press). Table 1 demonstrates
the performance of the categorizer on 589 proper nouns
occurring in the test set. In addition to 589 proper
nouns, 14 common words were incorrectly identified as
proper nouns due to errors by the part of speech tagger
and typos in the original text; and the boundaries of 11
proper nouns were incorrectly recognized due to unusual
proper noun phrases such as, &apos;Virginia Group to
Alleviate Smoking in Public&apos;, which the proper noun
boundary identification heuristics has failed to bracket.
64 proper nouns were correctly categorized as
miscellaneous as they did not belong to any of our 29
meaningful categories. This may be considered a
coverage problem in our proper noun categorization
scheme, not an error in our categorizer. Some examples
of the proper nouns belonging to the miscellaneous
category are: &apos;Promised Land&apos;, &apos;Mickey Mouse&apos;, and
&apos;IUD&apos;. The last row of Table 1 shows the overall
precision of our categorizer based on the proper nouns
which belong to the 29 meaningful categories.
In our initial implementation (Paik et al, in press),
errors in categorizing person and city names accounted
for 68% of the total errors. To improve performance, we
added a list of common first names, which was semi-

automatically extracted from Associated Press and Wall
Street Journal corpora, as a special lexicon to consult
when there is no match using all categorization
procedures. This addition improved our precision of
categorizing person names from the initial system&apos;s
46% to 90%.
The errors in categorizing city names, in our initial
categorizer, were mainly due to two problems. They are:
1) The locational source of the news, when mentioned
at the beginning of the document, is usually capitalized
in Wall Street Journal. This special convention of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996392">
158
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.912811235294118">
newspaper texts caused miscategorizing the locational
proper nouns (usually city names) as a miscellaneous;
and
2) City names which were not in our proper noun
knowledge base
The first problem was handled in our new proper noun
categorizer by moving the locational information of the
news story to a new, field, &apos;&lt;DATELINE&gt;&apos;, and
normalizing capitalization (from all upper case texts to
mixed case) at the document preprocessing stage before
the part of speech tagging. For example, if a story is
about a company in Dallas then the text will be as
below:
&lt;DOC&gt;
DALLAS: American Medical Insurance Inc. said that ...
&lt;/DOC&gt;
After the new preprocessing module is applied, the text
will be as below:
&lt;DATELINE&gt; Dallas &lt;/DATELINE
&lt;DOC&gt;
American Medical Insurance Inc. said that ...
based on the analysis of randomly selected documents.
We feel the limitations of not manually updating our
proper noun knowledge base for uncommon proper
nouns when confronted with proper nouns such as
Place de la Reunion&apos; and &apos;Pacific Northwest&apos;. Thus, we
are currently developing a strategy based on context
clues using locational prepositions as well as
appositional phrases to improve categorization of
uncommon proper nouns.
Table 2 shows the overall recall figure of our categorizer
which is affected by the proper noun phrase boundary
identification errors caused by the general-purpose
phrase bracketter.

For the second problem, we incorporated a context rule
for identifying city names to our categorizer. The rule is
that city names are followed by a country name or a
province name from the United States and Canada
unless the name is very well known. For example, &apos;Van
Nuys&apos;, can now be categorized as a city name as it is
preceded by a valid United States province name.
... Van Nuys, Calif. ...
By adding the above new procedures to our
categorization system as well as some well known city
names which are not province capitals or heavily
populated places based on IDA&apos;s Gazetteer to our proper
noun knowledge base, the precision of categorizing city
names has improved from initial system&apos;s 25% to
100%.
The overall precision of our new proper noun
categorizer has improved to 93% from 77% based on
our initial attempt (Paik et al, in press) including proper
nouns which are correctly categorized as miscellaneous.
This significant advancement was achieved by adding a

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999169625">
To compare our proper noun categorization results to
the evaluation of a system with similar goals in the
literature, we chose Coates-Stephens&apos; (1992) result on
acquiring genus information of proper nouns to compare
our overall precision. While his approach is to acquire
information about unknown proper nouns&apos; detailed
genus and differentia description, we consider our
approach of assigning a category from a classification
scheme of 30 classes to an unknown proper noun
generally similar in purpose to his acquisition of genus
information. However, it should be noted that our
method for assigning categories to proper nouns is
different from Coates-Stephens&apos; method, as we rely
more on built-in knowledge bases while his approach
relies more on context.
Based on 100 unseen documents which had 535
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995962">

<bodyText confidence="0.99990108">
unknown proper nouns, FUNES (Coates-Stephens,
1992) successfully acquired genus information for 340
proper nouns. Of the 195 proper nouns not acquired, 92
were due to the system&apos;s parse failure. Thus, the success
ratio based on only the proper nouns which were
analyzed by the system, was 77%. DR-LINK&apos;s proper
noun categorizer&apos;s overall precision, which is computed
with the same formula, was 93%, including proper
nouns which were correctly categorized as
miscellaneous.
Katoh&apos;s (1991) evaluation of his machine, translation
system, which was based on translating the 1,000 most
frequent names in the AP news corpus, successfully
analyzed 94% of the 1,000 names. Our precision figure
of categorizing person names was 90%.
Finally, the evaluation result from Rau&apos;s (1991)
company name extractor is compared to the precision
figure of our company name categorization. Both
systems relied heavily on company name suffixes.
Rau&apos;s result showed 97.5% success ratio of the
program&apos;s extraction of company names that had
company name suffixes. Our system&apos;s precision figure
was 88%. However, it should be noted that our result is
based on all company names, including those which did
not have any clear company name suffixes or prefixes.

Expansion of group proper nouns and group common nouns is performed on queries. Standardization and categorization is performed on queries and documents. DR-LINK&apos;s overall precision for proper noun categorization was 93%, based on 589 proper nouns occurring in the evaluation set. 1. Introduction In information retrieval, proper nouns, group proper nouns, and group common nouns present unique problems. Proper nouns are recognized as an important source of information for detecting relevant documents in information retrieval and extracting contents from a text (Rau, 1991). Yet most of the unknown words in texts which degrade the performance of natural language processing information retrieval systems are proper nouns. Group proper nouns (e.g., Middle East) and group common nouns (e.g., third world) will not match on their constituents unless the group entity is mentioned in the document. The proper noun processor herein described is a module in the DR-LINK system (Liddy et al, in press) for document detection being developed under the auspices of ARPA&apos;s TIPSTER program. Our approach to solving the group common noun and the group proper noun problem has been to</context>
