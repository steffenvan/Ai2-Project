<bodyText confidence="0.999837315789474">
The problem of finding lexical alignments for given
sentence pairs is computationally expensive. Fur-
thermore, it is much difficult to find lexical align-
ments between Korean and English since they have
considerably different syntactic structures and the
coverage of word-for-word correspondences is low.
This paper presents a method for extracting struc-
tural features which can reduce mapping space by
allowing only probable alignments. We describe how
the features improve the performance of the lexical
alignment model. The structural features provide
the information for the correspondences of parts-of-
speech (POS) sequences which are useful in transla-
tion. Based on maximum entropy (ME) concept, the
structural features are incrementally selected, which
are later embedded in the lexical alignment model.
It turns out that the features help get better lex-
ical alignments of Korean and English by offering
linguistic knowledge.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.964993294117647">
Aligned bitexts are useful for the derivation of
bilingual lexical resources which are used for ma-
chine translation and cross languages information
retrieval. Thus, a lot of approaches have been sug-
gested to find sets of corresponding word tokens
(Brown et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Melamed,
1997), phrase (Shin et al., 1996), noun phrase (Ku-
piec, 1993), and collocation (Smadja et al., 1996) in
a bitext.
Some works have used lexical association measures
for finding word correspondences (Gale and Church,
1991; Fung and Church, 1994). However, the associ-
ation measures can be misled in cases where a word
in a source language frequently co-occurs with more
than one word in a target language or in cases of
indirect association&apos; (Melamed, 1997).
In other works, iterative parameter re-estimation
&apos;Suppose that Uk and vk are indeed mutual translation
and Uk and Uk-ki often co-occur in text. Then vk and 24+1
will also co-occur more than expected by chance , which is
represented as indirect association.
techniques based on IBM model 1-5 2 have been
employed (Brown et al., 1993). They were usually
incorporated in the EM algorithm (Brown et al.,
1993; Kupiec, 1993; Tillmann and Ney, 2000; Och
et al., 2000). However, we are often faced with some
difficulties as follows, when the IBM model-based
approaches are directly applied to the alignment,
especially on bitext involving a less closely related
language pair.
1. It needs excessive iteration time for parame-
ter estimation and high decoding complexity.
Thus most systems assumed one-to-one corre-
spondence to reduce computational complex-
ity. However, word sequences are not trans-
lated literally word for word. For example, in
cases of collocations, compound nouns, and am-
biguous words with different meaning depen-
dent on the context, they require phrase-level
correspondences.
2. Most systems use little or no linguistic knowl-
edge to structure the underlying models. The
distortion probability and the fertility probabil-
ity for finding word correspondences is a weak
description for word order change between lan-
guages and 1:n mapping modeling. As the re-
sult, lots of ungrammatical sentences and too
many parameters to be estimated are allowed.
In addition, many words are aligned to the
empty word due to the overfitting problem (Och
et al., 2000).

2 The problems of lexical alignment
in Korean and English bitext
Although one-to-one correspondence assumption has
been shown to give highly accurate results in closely
related language pair (Melamed, 1997), it does not
fit in structurally different language pair such as Ko-
rean and English. According to Shin et al. (1996),
the coverage of one-to-one correspondence in Korean
and English bitext is approximately 34% and many-
to-many mappings exceed 40% in lexical alignments.
Besides, Korean and English show much difference
in terms of unit of mutual translation as shown in
Table 1.
Thus, we use structural or linguistic information
to find accurate lexical alignments of bitext. In gen-
eral, structural information can be represented by
the form of bilingual correspondence of phrase struc-
ture (Watanabe et al., 2000) or dependency struc-
ture (Yamamoto, 2000).
To find these structural correspondences between
a language pair, unification-based grammar (Mat-
sumoto, 1993) or bilingual grammar (Wu, 1997) can
be used. That is, if we try to find structural match of
bitext, syntactic analysis of each text should be done
first. However, syntactic analysis of each text(or bi-
text) is also a hard and computationally complicated
problem.
In this paper, we propose POS sequence feature.
We consider correspondences between POS tag se-
quences of bitext as the structural information which
is important in determining structures and reduc-
ing unnecessary parameters of a statistical alignment
model. We induce the correspondences(structural
features) by a feature selection method based on the
ME framework. Finally, the structural features are
embedded in a lexical alignment model of English
and Korean bitext. Our model offers the following
advantages:

correspondences.

eters in statistical machine translation by elim-
inating syntactically unlikely alignments. The

set of probable alignments.

<listItem confidence="0.926676">
3. It is possible to estimate the probability of lex-
ical alignment in a relatively small size of cor-
pora.
4. The structural information is helpful in the con-
struction of a bilingual grammar.
3 Overview of the model
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991459620689656">
In general, there exist constaints among POS se-
quences mapping when aligning bitext. For instance,
in many cases a noun in Korean is translated to a
noun or a noun preceded by an article in English.
This POS constraint would be useful information in
alignment of a closely related pair as well as a less
closely related language pair.
Some approaches design an alignment algorithm
that maximizes the number of matching POS in
aligned segments (Papageorgiou et al., 1994). We
also assume that the mapping information of POS
sequences of a language pair is useful in a model of
statistical machine translation.
If there are similarities between corresponding
POS sequences in bitext, the structural feature
would be easily computed or identified. However,
a POS sequence in English often correspond to a to-
tally different POS sequence in Korean as shown in
the following example:
can/MD eui/ENTR1 sa/NNDE1 &apos;iss/AJMA da/ENTE
It is caused by the discrepancy between two lan-
guages.
Korean is an agglutinative language. A sentence
in Korean consists of a series of syntactic units called
eojeol. An eojeol delimited by whitespace is often
composed of a content word and function words.
Tense markers, clausal connectives, particles and so
forth are contained in an eojeol. Thus, one or more
words in English often correspond to an eojeol, i.e.
a couple of morphemes. For instance, a phrase, &apos;to
the school&apos;, in English corresponds to an eojeol &amp;quot;d4-
2___(haggyo-ro, school-to)&apos; in Korean.
Thus, we need a method for mapping POS se-
quences of bitext. In this paper, the correspondences
of POS tag sequences are obtained by automatic fea-
ture selection based on the ME framework. Here, a
feature is defined as a correspondence of POS tag
sequences in bitext.
The outline of finding correspondences of POS tag
sequences is as follows: First, our model starts with
initial features obtained by a supervision step. The
initial features are extracted from a small portion
of bitext, which of weights are trained by the IIS
algorithm (Berger et al., 1996; Pietra et al., 1997).
These are called initial active features.
In the next step, a feature pool is constructed from
training data. At this time, only features giving a
large gain to the model are selected. The final out-
put of feature selection is the set of active features
and the correspondences of POS tag sequences that
are represented with conditional probabilities.
The resulted features are used for the parameters
of bilingual text alignment. In the process, we look
at the words to ensure a correct alignment. That is,
the POS sequences are in fact encoding particular
words.
The underlying process is as follows:
Input: a set L of POS-labeled sentence pairs.

tures A using HS algorithm.
4. Create a feature pool P which is a set of possi-
ble combinations of tag sequences from sentence
pairs.
5. Filter P using frequency counts and similarity
with A.
6. Compute the approximate gains of the features
in P.
7. Select features(Ai) with large gain values, and
add A.

<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
As mentioned above, features which represent map-
pings of POS sequences in two languages are auto-
matically learned from bitext. The learning consists
of two steps: (1) supervised step and (2) unsuper-
vised feature selection.
In the supervised step, we manually aligned En-
glish and Korean texts. From the manually aligned
text, we consturct a feature pool which has initial
POS sequence correspondence. In the unsupervised
feature selection, the POS sequence correspondeces
are added to the feature pool.

4.1 Supervision Step
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995320210526316">
In the supervision step, a small portion of bi-
text is tagged using Brill&apos;s tagger (Brill, 1995) and
`MORANY&apos; (Yoon et. al., 1999), each of which
is for English and Korean tagging respectively. We
manually aligned each sentence pair in the bitext
and collected their correspondences of tag sequences.
For simplicity, we adjusted some part of Brill&apos;s tag
set.
First of all, we classified sentential patterns of En-
glish and Korean. Then, we aligned English and
Korean sentence pairs on the basis of the patterns.
Also, we made tag sequence construction rules with
respect to each language by analysis of the cases
where the words of one unit are separated and ad-
jacent. The rules are used when making a feature
pool.
After collecting the correspondences of POS tag
sequences, we used them as a set of initial active
features, A.

4.2 Construction of a Feature Pool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998132444444444">
In this chapter, we describe how a feature pool is
constructed. Our task is to construct a probabil-
ity model p that produces a corresponding Korean
tag sequence &amp;quot;Tic for a given English tag sequence
J. As features to represent the model, we use co-
occurrence information of POS tag sequences.
Let Ts be all possible correspondences of tag se-
quences for a specific sentence pair, S. We then
define a feature function (or a feature) as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.984357333333333">
1 x = te &amp; y = tk Sz
fte,t,(x,y) = pair(te,tk) E TS
0 otherwise
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999678">
A feature fte,t,, which indicates co-occurrence be-
tween tags appearing in Ts, expresses information
for predicting that an English POS tag sequence te
maps into a Korean POS tag sequence tk •
In order to make a feature pool, given a sentence
pair, we first construct all possible combinations of
English POS tag sequences and Korean POS tag se-
quences. Among them, only features fte,t, that sat-
isfy the following two conditions are added into the
feature pool P.

4.3 Feature selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999622714285714">
Since the set of P is too vast, a feature selection pro-
cess is needed to select useful features. For this, each
feature is evaluated according to how much they con-
tribute to the likelihood of training data, which is
called gain.
Before explaining feature gain and a process of
feature selection, we will give a brief introduction of
ME. In ME, a feature gives information to a proba-
bility model and it has a weight.
Thus, the model is constrained by features we de-
fined. In general weights of the features are trained
by the improved iterative scaling (IIS) algorithm
that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-
tween the model and the empirical distribution of
the training data.
In fact, our model reduces to a simple type of
probability model that can be derived simply from
a ratio counts since the features do not overlap.
Let pA be the optimal model constrained by a set
of initial active features A, then it can be represented
in (1).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9999635">
pA(ylx) = LAyix)eE fi (x,Y) (1)
zA(x) = Ep(yix)eE
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952545454545">
The weights (A) of active features are computed by
the IIS before feature selection.
Let ,41, be AU L, and pAL be the optimal model
in the space of probability distribution after adding
feature L. The model p.,611 contains another param-
eter a, in addition to the parameters given by active
features, which is a weight for the feature L. In order
to make it tractable to compute feature selection, we
assume that the addition of a feature L affects only
the single parameter a. The only parameter which
distinguishes models of (2) is a.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996204">
The improvement (gain) of a model after adding a
single feature L can be estimated by measuring dif-
ference of maximum log-likelihood between L(pAL)
and L(pA). We denote the gain for feature L by
A(,41), which is represented in (3).

This algorithm is iteratively computed using Net-

ture accords with the model. As a result, we can se-
lect useful features with high gain values and obtain
their conditional probabilities. Put another way, we
can get the correspondence probabilities of POS tag
sequences.

In this section, we describe how the correspondence
probabilities between bilingual POS sequences is em-
bedded in lexical alignment. In Korean-English ma-
chine translation, a translation system finds the cor-
responding sentence e given a Korean sentence k.
The fundamental equation of machine translation
can be represented in (4), where the random vari-
ables K and E are a Korean sentence and a En-
glish sentence making up a translation, and the ran-
dom variable A is an alignment between them. The
equation is related with a language model probabil-
ity, P(e), a translation model probability P(kle). In

English 2149 words and Korean 3317 eojeols with low

eojeols with high frequency (50-300) were found.
For an evaluation, 100 words and 100 eojeols were se-

jeols) were evaluated. As a result, it turns out that
the structural features are effective in rare words.

Another advantage of the use of structural fea-
tures is to reduce parameter space of the lexical
alignment model. To show the impacts on the size of
the parameter space reduced by our model, we com-
pared the results from our model with those from
the IBM 1-model presented by Brown et al. (1993)
on 100 sentence pairs. The number of parameters
obtained means the counts of possible lexical map-
pings.
As shown in Table 8, the number of prameters
were drastically reduced in our model. Considering
the complexity of another models (IBM 2-5) it is
obvious that they have more parameters.

As described before, only n(English):1 and 1:1 map-

comparison, we investigated the alignments of the
English 100 words with high frequency, which were
explained above.
Table 9 shows the accuracy of lexical alignments.
It is shown that the structural features have an effect
on the alignment even though the amount of data
investigated is small.
However, the overall accuracy of the alignment is
somewhat low, which is mainly due to the small size
of training samples. Table 10 shows some results of
mutual translation. We see a considerable improve-
ment when allowing for structural features (corre-
spondences of POS tag sequences) in lexical align-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989904761905">
Because of the considerable difference between En-
glish and Korean, computation cost of lexical align-
ment is very high. One solution of the problem is to
provide mapping information of syntactic structure
between the two languages.
In this paper, we defined the structural feature as
the correspondence of POS tag sequences and pre-
sented a method for extraction of structural features
for Korean-English bilingual alignment. Firstly, the
initial active features were collected from a small
size of manually aligned bitext, which are trained by
IIS which is a training algorithm for ME. Secondly,
extracted from training data, the features giving a
large gain were added to the set of active features.
Furthermore, the features extracted were tested
for lexical alignment of bitext. The experiment
showed that the features are helpful for reducing
the mapping space in alignment. We expect that
the alignment can be more accurate and efficient by
combining the structural features with translation
lexicon in the future.

<abstract confidence="0.99917085">The problem of finding lexical alignments for given sentence pairs is computationally expensive. Furthermore, it is much difficult to find lexical alignments between Korean and English since they have considerably different syntactic structures and the coverage of word-for-word correspondences is low. This paper presents a method for extracting structural features which can reduce mapping space by allowing only probable alignments. We describe how the features improve the performance of the lexical alignment model. The structural features provide the information for the correspondences of parts-ofspeech (POS) sequences which are useful in translation. Based on maximum entropy (ME) concept, the structural features are incrementally selected, which are later embedded in the lexical alignment model. It turns out that the features help get better lexical alignments of Korean and English by offering linguistic knowledge.</abstract>

Based on maximum entropy (ME) concept, the structural features are incrementally selected, which are later embedded in the lexical alignment model. It turns out that the features help get better lexical alignments of Korean and English by offering linguistic knowledge. 1 Introduction Aligned bitexts are useful for the derivation of bilingual lexical resources which are used for machine translation and cross languages information retrieval. Thus, a lot of approaches have been suggested to find sets of corresponding word tokens (Brown et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Melamed, 1997), phrase (Shin et al., 1996), noun phrase (Kupiec, 1993), and collocation (Smadja et al., 1996) in a bitext. Some works have used lexical association measures for finding word correspondences (Gale and Church, 1991; Fung and Church, 1994). However, the association measures can be misled in cases where a word in a source language frequently co-occurs with more than one word in a target language or in cases of indirect association&apos; (Melamed, 1997).

Thus, we need a method for mapping POS sequences of bitext. In this paper, the correspondences of POS tag sequences are obtained by automatic feature selection based on the ME framework. Here, a feature is defined as a correspondence of POS tag sequences in bitext. The outline of finding correspondences of POS tag sequences is as follows: First, our model starts with initial features obtained by a supervision step. The initial features are extracted from a small portion of bitext, which of weights are trained by the IIS algorithm (Berger et al., 1996; Pietra et al., 1997). These are called initial active features. In the next step, a feature pool is constructed from training data. At this time, only features giving a large gain to the model are selected. The final output of feature selection is the set of active features and the correspondences of POS tag sequences that are represented with conditional probabilities. The resulted features are used for the parameters of bilingual text alignment. In the process, we look at the words to ensure a correct alignment. That is, the POS sequences are in fact encoding particular words. The underlyi</context>

A (AL) maxcEGAf, (a) (3) GAfi (a) = L(PAf) L(PA) log PA‘f PA The following algorithm is used to compute the gain of the model with respect to L.

In the unsupervised feature selection, the POS sequence correspondeces are added to the feature pool. 4.1 Supervision Step In the supervision step, a small portion of bitext is tagged using Brill&apos;s tagger (Brill, 1995) and `MORANY&apos; (Yoon et. al., 1999), each of which is for English and Korean tagging respectively. We manually aligned each sentence pair in the bitext and collected their correspondences of tag sequences. For simplicity, we adjusted some part of Brill&apos;s tag set. First of all, we classified sentential patterns of English and Korean. Then, we aligned English and Korean sentence pairs on the basis of the patterns.

The structural information is helpful in the construction of a bilingual grammar. 3 Overview of the model In general, there exist constaints among POS sequences mapping when aligning bitext. For instance, in many cases a noun in Korean is translated to a noun or a noun preceded by an article in English. This POS constraint would be useful information in alignment of a closely related pair as well as a less closely related language pair. Some approaches design an alignment algorithm that maximizes the number of matching POS in aligned segments (Papageorgiou et al., 1994). We also assume that the mapping information of POS sequences of a language pair is useful in a model of statistical machine translation. If there are similarities between corresponding POS sequences in bitext, the structural feature would be easily computed or identified. However, a POS sequence in English often correspond to a totally different POS sequence in Korean as shown in the following example: can/MD eui/ENTR1 sa/NNDE1 &apos;iss/AJMA da/ENTE It is caused by the discrepancy between two languages. Korean is an agglutinative language. A sentence in Korean consists of a series of syntactic u</context>

Thus, we need a method for mapping POS sequences of bitext. In this paper, the correspondences of POS tag sequences are obtained by automatic feature selection based on the ME framework. Here, a feature is defined as a correspondence of POS tag sequences in bitext. The outline of finding correspondences of POS tag sequences is as follows: First, our model starts with initial features obtained by a supervision step. The initial features are extracted from a small portion of bitext, which of weights are trained by the IIS algorithm (Berger et al., 1996; Pietra et al., 1997). These are called initial active features. In the next step, a feature pool is constructed from training data. At this time, only features giving a large gain to the model are selected. The final output of feature selection is the set of active features and the correspondences of POS tag sequences that are represented with conditional probabilities. The resulted features are used for the parameters of bilingual text alignment. In the process, we look at the words to ensure a correct alignment. That is, the POS sequences are in fact encoding particular words. The underlying process is as follo</context>
