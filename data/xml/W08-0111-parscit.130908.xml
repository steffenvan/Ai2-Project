We look at the average frequency of con-
trastive connectives in the SPaRKy Restaurant
Corpus with respect to realization ratings by
human judges. We implement a discriminative
n-gram ranker to model these ratings and ana-
lyze the resulting n-gram weights to determine
if our ranker learns this distribution. Surpris-
ingly, our ranker learns to avoid contrastive
connectives. We look at possible explanations
for this distribution, and recommend improve-
ments to both the generator and ranker of the
sentence plans/realizations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999106875">
Contrastive discourse connectives are words or
phrases such as however and on the other hand.
They indicate a contrastive discourse relation be-
tween two units of discourse. While corpus-based
studies on discourse connectives usually look at nat-
urally occurring human-authored examples, in this
study, we investigate the set of connectives used
in the automatically generated SPaRKy Restaurant
Corpus1. Specifically, we consider the relationship
between connective usage and judges ratings, and
investigate whether our n-gram ranker learns the
preferred connective usage. Based on these findings
and previous work on contrastive connectives, we
present suggestions for modifying both the genera-
tor and the ranker in order to improve the generation
of realizations containing contrastive connectives.

2.1 SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99824275">
The SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus was generated by
the MATCH Spoken Language Generator (Walker et
al., 2007) which consists of a dialog manager, SPUR
text planner (Walker et al., 2004), SPaRKy sentence
planner (Walker et al., 2007), and RealPro surface
realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).
The corpus contains realizations for 3 dialogue
strategies:

<listItem confidence="0.99978">
• RECOMMEND (REC): recommend an entity from
a set of entities
• COMPARE-2 (C2): compare 2 entities
• COMPARE-3 (C3): compare 3 or more entities
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999695928571429">
Each strategy contains 30 content plans from
which either 16 or 20 sentence plans were generated
by the SPaRKy sentence plan generator. 4 sentence
plans were discarded due to duplication upon real-
ization, totaling 1756 realizations in the corpus.2
A content plan consists of several assertions and
the relations which hold between them. Con-
tent plans from the RECOMMEND strategy ex-
clusively employ the Rhetorical Structure Theory
(RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987) relation JUS-
TIFY while those from COMPARE-2 use CONTRAST
and ELABORATION. COMPARE-3 content plans
consists mostly of CONTRAST and ELABORATION
relations, though some use only JUSTIFY. In addi-

this is the case; however, the difference in reported amounts is
quite small, and so should not affect the outcome of this study.

tion, the SPaRKy sentence plan generator adds the
INFER relation to assertions whose relations were
not specified by the content planner.
During the sentence planning phase, SPaRKy or-
ders the clauses and combines them using randomly
selected clause-combining operations. During this
process, a clause-combining operation may insert 1
of 7 connectives according to the RST relation that
holds between two discourse units (i.e. inserting
since or because for a JUSTIFY relation; and, how-
ever, on the other hand, while, or but for a CON-
TRAST relation; or and for an INFER relation).
After each sentence plan is generated, it is real-
ized by the RealPro surface realizer and the result-
ing realization is rated by two judges on a scale of
1-5, where 5 is highly preferred. These ratings are
then averaged, producing a range of 9 possible rat-
ings from 11, 1.5, ..., 51.

2.2 Ratings/Connectives Correlation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966851063829">
From the ratings of the examples in Figure 1, we
can see that some of the SPaRKy sentence plan re-
alizations seem more natural than others. Upon fur-
ther analysis, we noticed that utterances containing
many contrastive connectives seemed less preferred
than those with fewer or no contrastive connectives.
To quantify this observation, we calculated the av-
erage number of connectives (aveci) used per real-
ization with rating i, using aveci = Totalci/Nri,
where Totalci is the total number of connectives in
realizations with rating i, and Nri is the number of
realizations with rating i.
We use Pearson’s r to calculate each correlation
(in each case, df = 7). For both COMPARE strategies
(represented in Figure 2(a) and 2(b)), we find a sig-
nificant negative correlation for the average number
of connectives used in realizations with a given rat-
ing (C2: r = −0.97, p &lt; 0.01; and C3: r = −0.93,
p &lt; 0.01). These correlations indicate that judges’
ratings decreased as the average frequency of the
connectives increased.
Further analysis of the individual correlations
used in the comparative strategies show that there is
a significant negative correlation for however (C2:
r = −0.91, p &lt; 0.01; and C3: r = −0.86,
p &lt; 0.01) and on the other hand (C2: r = −0.89,
p &lt; 0.01; and C3: r = −0.84, p &lt; 0.01) in both
COMPARE strategies. In addition, in COMPARE-3,
the frequencies of while and but are also signifi-
cantly and strongly negatively correlated with the
judges’ ratings (r = −0.86, p &lt; 0.01 and r =
−0.90, p &lt; 0.01, respectively), though there is no
such correlation between the use of these connec-
tives and their ratings in COMPARE-2.
Added together, all the contrastive connectives
show strong, significant negative correlations be-
tween their average frequencies and judges’ ratings
for both comparative strategies (C2: r = −0.93,
p &lt; 0.01; C3:r = −0.88, p &lt; 0.01).
Interestingly, unlike in the COMPARE strategies,
there is a positive correlation (r = 0.73, p &gt; 0.05)
between the judges’ ratings and the average fre-
quency of all connectives used in the RECOMMEND
strategy (see Figure 2(c)). Since this strategy only
uses and, since, and because and does not utilize any
contrastive connectives, this gives further evidence
that only contrastive connectives are dispreferred.

2002). As in Walker et. al (2007), we first pre-
pared the SPaRKy Restaurant Corpus by replacing
named entity tokens (e.g numbers, restaurant names,
etc.) with their corresponding type (e.g. NUM for
61), and added BEGIN and END tokens to mark the
boundaries of each realization. We then trained our
ranker to learn which unigrams, bigrams, and tri-
grams are associated with the ratings given to the
realizations in the training set.
Although we implemented our ranker in order to
carry out an error analysis on the individual fea-
tures (i.e. n-grams) used by the ranker, we also
found that our n-gram ranker performed compara-
bly (REC: 3.5; C2: 4.1; C3: 3.8)3 to the full-featured
SPaRKy ranker (REC: 3.6; C2: 4.0; C3: 3.6) out of
a possible best (human-performance) score of (REC:
4.2; C2: 4.5; C3: 4.2).
Using a perl script4, we extracted feature weights
learned by the ranker from the models built dur-
ing the training phase. After averaging the feature
weights across 10 training partitions, we examined
the top 20% (C2:112/563 features; C3: 192/960
features) most negatively weighted features in each
strategy to see whether our ranker was learning to
avoid contrastive connectives. Table 1 shows that

53.6% of the 20% most negatively weighted features
in COMPARE-2 and 24.0% of the 20% of the most
negatively weighted features used in COMPARE-3.
Interestingly, COMPARE-2 features that contained
either however or on the other hand (o.t.o.h) make
up the bulk of the contrastive connectives found in
the negatively weighted features, mirroring the re-
sults of the correlations for COMPARE-2. This indi-
cates that the discriminative n-gram ranker learns to
avoid using contrastive connectives.

3 Contrastive Connectives Usage
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999824">
3.1 Usage Restrictions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908">
Previous work on contrastive connectives have
found that these connectives often have different re-
strictions on their location in the discourse struc-
ture, with respect to maintaining discourse coher-
ance (Quirk et al., 1972; Grote et al., 1995).
Quirk et. al. (1972) classifies however and on
the other hand as subordinating conjuncts, a class
of connectives that do not allow their clauses to be
reordered without changing the perlocutionary force
of the sentence (e.g. contrast C2: Alts # 11 &amp; 13 in
Figure 1). In addition, on the other hand prompts
readers to regard the 2nd clause as more important
(Grote et al., 1995). Given that both however and
on the other hand contain the same restrictions on
clause ordering, it seems reasonable that they would
pattern the same with respect to assigning clausal
prominence. This predicts that if the human judges
rated the SPaRKy realizations based on the expecta-
tion of a particular perlocutionary act (e.g., that the
comparison highlights the restaurant with the best
decor), they would prefer realizations where how-
ever or on the other hand were attached to the more

desirable of the contrasted qualities. When we ex-
amine the SPaRKy realizations and ratings, this in-
deed seems to be the case – when the better property
is ordered last, the realization was rated very highly
(e.g. Alt 8 &amp; 13 in Figure 1), but when the lesser
property was ordered last, the realization was rated
poorly (e.g. Alt 7 &amp; 11 in Figure 1).
In contrast, while and but are not subordinating
conjuncts and so are not subject to the clause or-
dering restriction. Thus, realizations with their con-
trasted clauses in either order should be rated simi-
larly, and indeed, this is what we find in the corpus
(e.g. Alts 3&amp;10, and 14&amp;15 in Figure 1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996697">
3.2 Other Factors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837954545454">
In addition to clause order, another factor that may
contribute to the awkwardness of however and on
the other hand in some usages is that both of these
connectives seem to be rather “grand” for these sim-
ple contrasts. Intuitively, these connectives seem
to indicate a larger contrast than while and but, so
when they are used to indicate small contrasts (e.g.
contrasting only one quality), or contrasts close to-
gether on the scale (e.g. good vs. decent) instead
of diametric opposites, they sound awkward. In ad-
dition, however and on the other hand may also be
seeking “heavy” arguments that contain more syl-
lables, words, or complex syntax. Lastly, human-
authored comparisons, such as in this example from
CNET.com:
...[it] has two convenient USB ports at the bottom of the
front panel. Its beige predecessor, on the other hand,
supplied these only on the back of the box.
seem to indicate that when our expectations of ar-
gument order are violated, the 2nd clause is often
qualified by words such as “just” or “only”, as if to
acknowledge the flaunted preference.

4 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991724137931">
Due to the poverty of highly rated instances of con-
trastive connective usage (particularly for however
and on the other hand), our ranker learns to avoid
these connectives in most situations. However, the
ratings suggest that people do not dislike these con-
trastives unilaterally, but rather prefer them in spe-
cific usage patterns only. One way to combat this
problem is to modify the sentence planner to take
into account these semantic preferences for argu-
ment ordering when selecting a contrastive connec-
tive. This should produce a wider variety of can-
didates that observe this ordering preference, and
thus provide the ranker with more highly rated can-
diates that use contrastive connectives. This is not
to say that only candidates observing this preference
should be generated, but merely that a wider variety
of candiates should be generated so that the ranker
has more opportunities to learn the restrictions sur-
rounding the use of contrastive connectives.
As for the ranker, we can also identify features
that are sensitive to these linguistic properties. Cur-
rently, n-gram features don’t capture the semantic
nuances such as argument order or the scalar dis-
tance between property values, so identifying fea-
tures that capture this type of information should
improve the ranker. Together, these improvements
to both the quality of the generated candidate space
and the ranking model should improve the accuracy
of the top-rated/selected candidate.

This indicates that the discriminative n-gram ranker learns to avoid using contrastive connectives. 3 Contrastive Connectives Usage 3.1 Usage Restrictions Previous work on contrastive connectives have found that these connectives often have different restrictions on their location in the discourse structure, with respect to maintaining discourse coherance (Quirk et al., 1972; Grote et al., 1995). Quirk et. al. (1972) classifies however and on the other hand as subordinating conjuncts, a class of connectives that do not allow their clauses to be reordered without changing the perlocutionary force of the sentence (e.g. contrast C2: Alts # 11 &amp; 13 in Figure 1). In addition, on the other hand prompts readers to regard the 2nd clause as more important (Grote et al., 1995). Given that both however and on the other hand contain the same restrictions on clause ordering, it seems reasonable that they would pattern the same with respect to assigning clausal prominence.
