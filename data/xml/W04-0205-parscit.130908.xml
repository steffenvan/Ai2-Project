This paper discusses an annotation scheme for
Korean null pronouns, which were used in an-
notating three kinds of Korean text corpora in-
cluding Penn Korean Treebank. In annotat-
ing the corpora, null pronouns and their an-
tecedents were marked up for their type and
reference, with coreference relation tracked by
numeric identifiers. Based on the annotation
scheme, an outline of a potential pronoun res-
olution strategy is also proposed. The result-
ing dataset of annotated text is rather small at
11,834 words; we hope the null pronoun classifi-
cation and annotation scheme proposed in this
study will serve as a basis in developing a large-
scale annotated corpus in the future.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.965393896551724">
Korean is one of the class of languages which
permits extensive use of null arguments. These
zero arguments are believed to be a substi-
tute for pronouns&apos; and have received terms that
reflect such a view throughout the literature,
including zero anaphor, zero pronominal, and
more theory—specific pro. I adopt the term null
pronoun in my paper.
Use of null pronouns in a discourse has been
believed to be largely governed by discourse
principles. In such uses of null pronouns,
saliency of their referents in the discourse con-
text is said to play a major role. However,
null pronouns are not always anaphoric in terms
of the types of reference. In a categorization
proposed by Kameyama (1985) for Japanese
zero anaphora, three subcategories belong to
the type of &amp;quot;text independent use&amp;quot;, which cover
non-anaphoric usage of zero pronouns. This
classification is given in Table 1.
The first category, &amp;quot;discourse anaphoric zero
anaphor&amp;quot;, is where the null pronoun derives
its referents from what has been said earlier in
&apos;Kameyama (1985) chapter 3.3
text dependent discourse anaphoric zero anaphor
text zero deictic and zero indexical
independent
indefinite personal zero anaphor
general situational zero anaphor

the text and is motivated by discourse effects.
The second main category, which represents the
text independent use of null pronouns, is non-
anaphoric in nature: the entities referred to by
null pronouns in the category are not verbally
expressed in the discourse.
Korean null pronouns show the same kind
of usage: it is not difficult to construct exam-
ples for these categories in Korean, as shown
in examples 1-3. Zero deictic and zero indexi-
cal pronouns (in example 1) are null pronouns
that directly refer to an entity in the given spa-
tiotemporal context. Indefinite personal zero
anaphors (in 2) are usually a subject and re-
fer to the people in general, as in some uses of
English they, one and yogi. General situational
zero anaphors (in 3) are zero subjects that refer
to time, weather, and a general situation like
English dummy subject it.

This paper presents a result of preliminary
studies on Korean null pronouns, based on find-
ings from real corpora. The main purpose is to
establish a suitable classification scheme for Ko-
rean null pronouns and propose an annotation
scheme which can serve as a guideline for pro-
ducing an annotated corpus which can eventu-
ally be used in developing a pronoun resolution
system.

2 The Corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999675428571429">
For this study, I used three distinct sources of
corpora: 7 pieces of news and magazine articles,
the novel Little Prince chapters 1 through 8,
and part of the Penn Korean Treebank corpus2.
The entire collection of the corpora consisted of
11,834 words3, with a total of 1,299 sentences.
The average length of sentences is 9.11 words;
the sentences in the article corpus proved to be
the longest, and those in the novel Little Prince
were the shortest. There were 1,028 tokens of
null pronouns identified in total. The article
corpus shows the highest number of null pro-
nouns per sentence, which is largely due to its
longer sentence length overall. When the fre-
quency of the null pronoun occurrence is mea-
sured with the word as the unit, the article cor-
pus in fact scores the lowest among the three
corpus. The statistic facts about the three cor-
pora are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.
Taking the number of null pronoun per word
as the indicator, the frequencies of null pro-
nouns represented in the three corpus are in
the following order: articles &gt; Little Prince
&gt; Penn Korean Treebank. The Penn Korean
Treebank corpus entirely consists of dialogue se-
quences, and the novel Little Prince is intended
for a younger audience with many dialogues
scattered throughout the text. From this, one

From examining the null pronoun cases in the
corpora, I found the classification system in Ta-
ble 1 proposed for Japanese to be largely suit-
able for Korean. However, I would like to in-
troduce a further subcategorization for the class
&apos;Discourse-anaphoric&apos; and propose a revision on
the class &apos;Anonymous&apos;, which is shown in Table

First, I suggest that the &apos;Discourse-anaphoric&apos;
class be subdivided into &apos;Propositional
anaphoric&apos; and &apos;Noun Phrase anaphoric&amp;quot;.
The distinction is a semantic one: Proposi-
tional null pronouns are those that refer to a
propositional content or an event represented
by a sentence, while NP anaphoric null pro-
nouns are those that are coreferential with
other noun phrase arguments mentioned in the
context. The following are examples of each

The rationale behind this distinction comes
not only from their apparent semantic differ-
ences: they show different patterns in terms
of their anaphoric tendencies. From the exam-
ple above, the sentence (4a) serves as the an-
tecedent of the subject null pronoun in (4b),
whereas in the case of NP-anaphoric pronouns,
the subject null pronoun is coreferential with
the subject NP of the preceding sentence. Un-
der an approach that attempts to provide an ex-
planation on their behavioral patterns such as
the Centering Theory, these two types are sub-
ject to different sets of rules. We discuss this
further in a later section.

3.2 Generic vs. Specific Indefinite Null
Pronouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924571428571">
Not all indefinite null pronouns are generic, e.g.
refer to the people in general. Sometimes, it
is understood from the context that there has
to be a specific entity that a null pronoun refers
to, although it is not mentioned anywhere in the
text or not locally accessible. Take the following
sentence, for example:

&apos;Cube is a work that (someone) made the

It is implied that there exists someone who is
the maker of the movie(the director), which is
the referent of the subject null pronoun. How-
ever, a mention of the director occurs only at a
later part of the text, after several intervening
paragraphs. Contrast this case with the follow-
ing example, where the null pronoun is referring
to an indefinite entity:

Notably, the indefiniteness of such null pro-
nouns is closely tied to the semantic interpreta-
tion of the sentence in which they occur. The
sentence often involves modal environment such
as conditionals and irrealis tense. From a theo-
retical linguistic point of view, this type of use of
null pronouns can be treated as involving quan-
tification on the pronoun by an operator resid-
ing outside of the pronoun itself.
Distinguishing such different types of indef-
inite null pronouns lets us extend the well-
studied specific/non-specific dichotomy of the
English indefinite article a to the case of Ko-
rean null pronouns.

4 Annotating the Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898">
The three corpora were annotated using the
proposed classification system for Korean null
pronouns; null pronouns were identified and cat-
egorized in the text, with their potential an-
tecedents identified where applicable. Some is-
sues arose in the course of studying the corpus,
which were reflected in designing the annotation
scheme used for this study.

4.1 Where to Find the Invisibles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979807692308">
Null pronouns, being an invisible linguistic con-
struct, present a fundamental problem to be ad-
dressed prior to their treatment, namely their
identification. In fact, the problem of identi-
fication has direct consequences on the theory
of null pronouns and can be also approached in
a way that facilitates treatment of a particu-
lar problem of null pronouns, for example, null
pronoun resolution.
In order for an unexpressed element to be
identified, it has to be predictable from the
structure of the sentence in which it is con-
tained. Therefore, identification of null pro-
nouns crucially relies on the specific representa-
tion of the clause and sentence structures. The
most significant indicator is, arguably so in any
theory, the predicate. Predicates have their own
subcategorization structure, and when an argu-
ment is missing from this scheme, one can rea-
sonably induce the presence of a null pronoun.
For the purpose of annotation, the syntactic
annotation guidelines built for the Penn Korean
Treebank were assumed. The decision in part
was influenced by the fact that the Treebank
corpus used in this study is already annotated
according to the standards.

4.1.1 Situational Null Pronouns
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999641826086956">
In determining syntactic structures of a sen-
tence, there are cases which require judgment
that draws on a particular linguistic theory one
employs. One such case is the situational null
pronouns. Given they are both phonetically
and semantically null, is it necessary to posit
a null syntactic element for them in the first
place? One can subscribe to a syntactic theory
for Japanese or Korean which, unlike languages
such as English, simply do not require verbs to
have a syntactic subject. I will not pursue this
matter further in this paper, but instead offer
an argument in support of situational null pro-
nouns from a more practical perspective. For
an application dealing with null pronouns, it is
necessary at one stage or another to examine
all possible argument slots of a predicate and
determine whether it is filled or not, before de-
ciding whether the null pronoun is semantically
present. This is true because the subject slot of
those predicates with situational null subjects is
under no syntactic obligation that they should
be empty, as seen in example below:

The hour is 10 o&apos;clock already.&apos;
Therefore, from a practical point of view, it
is more suitable for an application to start with
every argument position that is unfilled and de-
termine whether there is a null element that has
a semantic content. This, in my opinion, can
be achieved without committing to any specific
theory of syntax.

Having the null pronoun as a valid construct in
a syntactic theory offers conflicting takes on two
or more predicates that seemingly share an ar-
gument. A sentence with two predicates which
share one subject can receive two distinct struc-
tural analyses: one with VP coordination with
a shared subject or the other with two coordi-
nated clauses with a null pronoun posited as the
subject in one of them, probably coindexed with
the subject of the other clause.

The Penn Korean Treebank offers strictly de-

tions. It allows for coordination at all levels:
VV, VP and S, whilst recommending coordi-
nation at the lowest level possible for a given
sentence. 4
Still a structural ambiguity remains even af-

sentences: it is yet to be decided which predi-

option of VV coordination is unavailable, will have to be

therefore, a null pronoun in the subject position in one of
the clauses. This annotation decision partly contributed
to a large number of subject null pronouns in a coordi-
nated S structure with intra-sentential coreference.

ture and the other with a subordinate S modi-

nective -.:2A1 -kose: &apos;and then&apos;).
In addition to the coordinated S structure
where the overt subject is associated with the
first predicate of the sequence, associating the
overt subject with the final VP will place the
null subject within an intervening subordinate
clause which modifies the main clause VP. 5

One important implication of these two dis-
tinct structures is the relative placement of the
overt NP and the null pronoun in terms of
clausal depth. Given that the final verb in Ko-
rean projects the matrix clause, the structure in
(10a) places the overt NP subject in the subor-
dinate clause and the null pronoun in the main
clause, while the relation is reversed in (10b).
If one is to view the overt subject NP as the
antecedent of the null pronoun, the analysis in
(10b) will appeal to many since the antecedent
is occupying a structurally higher position than
the bound null pronoun. Adding more sup-
port to this position, clausal depth of an argu-
ment plays a significant role in any theory which
attempts to represent level of saliency or dis-
course accessibility of discourse entities. From
this theoretical stance, it seems more reasonable
to place the full NP subject at the main clause
level for an easy back reference in subsequent
discourse.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.99047375">
5There is an obvious third possibility, where the null
pronoun linearly precedes the overt NP subject. As log-
ical it may be, this option seems highly unintuitive and
therefore is not considered here.

The Guidelines for Penn Korean Treebank
recommends an &amp;quot;incremental parsing&amp;quot; approach
(Chapter 22.3), i.e. associating the overt NP
subject with the lefthand side (subordinate
clause) VP and assigning a null pronoun to the
latter (main-clause) VP. However, it also notes
that this is just a guideline to be followed when
the annotator is in doubt. In a nutshell, I as-
sumed the structure in (10b) wherever possible,
i.e. in the other two corpora that have not been
pre-annotated with syntactic structures as the
Penn Korean Treebank is.

Once a null pronoun is identified, the next step
in corpus annotation is to determine its type,
according to the classification scheme previously

discuss some issues that arise in categorization,
which eventually lead to some design decisions
made for the annotation scheme, to be given in

<bodyText confidence="0.99966475">
Deictic pronouns are those that directly refer to
an entity that is present in the scene of the dis-
course, and anaphoric pronouns are those whose
reference can be determined via an antecedent
expression that is found within the text. Upon
a close look, however, these definitions are not
mutually exclusive: a null pronoun can refer to
an entity present in the discourse scene and have
a coreferential antecedent at the same time.
This is especially true for first and second per-
son pronouns, whose referents are always a part
of the discourse scene. Distinguishing between
the two distinct usages of such null pronouns is
not always straightforward. Consider the sub-
ject null pronoun in the second sentence. Should
it be anaphoric or deictic?

Rather than trying to look into the under-
lying principle that motivated the use of each
deictic/anaphoric null pronoun, my choice was
simply to allow a null pronoun to be anaphoric
and deictic at the same time. Whenever a null
pronoun refers to an entity that is understood
to be present in the discourse scene, mostly in
first person singular/plural and a second per-
son, it will bear a tag linking it to a discourse
entity, in addition to a number which coindexes
it with an antecedent NP in the text, if present.

In these examples, all the null pronouns refer
to generic &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; or anonymous &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot;.
Therefore they can be categorized as an indef-
inite generic use of a null pronoun. However,
note that the two pronouns within each sen-
tence are understood to be coreferential: in ex-
ample (12), the persons who wishes to catch
a tiger and having to go to the mountains are
the same one, whoever it might be. This fact
is expressed in the English translation for each
sentence, where the second occurrence of one is
substitutable with he. Semantically, one of the
two null pronouns is a bound variable, whose
referent is determined through the other one.6
This shows that two or more indefinite generic
null pronouns can share a referent, and there-
fore we need a means to express this fact. It
can be achieved by assigning each of such null

pronoun tokens a shared index, in the same
fashion as antecedent-anaphor resolution is ex-
pressed with coindexation. Therefore, both of
such generic null pronouns will bear two in-
dexes, one for their generic category and the
other expressing coreference relation, as shown
below.

4.3 The Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874947368421">
Annotation of the three corpora on null pro-
noun reference is done in the following manner.
For each null pronoun identified within a text,
all noun phrases with a same referent, in either
a full NP form, a pronominal or even the null
form with a same referent, are identified across
the text and given a unique numerical index.
All non-anaphoric types and propositional type
null pronouns are marked with their category.
For reasons explained in the previous sections,
deictic and generic null pronouns can also bear
numerical indices, further indicating a corefer-
ence relation between them and other NPs. For
anaphoric propositional null pronouns, their po-
tential antecedents are not an NP but rather a
clausal unit, which were identified and marked
with an index.
The following summarizes the coding scheme
used in annotation:

Example (16) shows a sample piece of coref-

rean Treebank style. For each null pronoun, the
coreference indices are given on its phrasal pro-
jection node. Noun phrases which are in a coref-
erence relation with any other null pronouns are
also given a numerical index.

5 A Reference Resolution System: a
Preview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932463682539683">
In most approaches to the resolution of English
pronouns, which usually concern the third per-
son pronouns only, a successful resolution means
locating an antecedent NP in the surrounding
text. However, in the case of Korean null pro-
nouns, the diverse nature of of the null pronouns
makes it necessary for a reference resolution sys-
tem to deal with two disparate tasks: classifica-
tion of the null pronoun and identification of the
referent. Moreover, each type of null pronoun
has a different definition of successful resolution.
For some types, the resolution stops at clas-
sification: once a null pronoun is classified as
an x-type, i.e. an expletive null pronoun, there
is no further step to be taken. Other types in-
volve identification of the referent in some way.
Deictic null pronouns need to be resolved to an
entity present in the discourse scene, in most
cases a discourse participant. Anaphoric pro-
nouns can be treated in the same manner as En-
glish pronouns by resolving to a coreferential
noun phrase in the text, if it is NP-anaphoric;
or by finding a clausal unit which it refers to if
it is propositional.
The cases of indefinite null pronouns are less
clear. From its definition, it is unlikely to be
able to recover the referent of specific indefi-
nites from the environment. One can also argue
that the referent of generic indefinites need not
be further resolved, as they can be left as vague
as required. However, the referent of a generic
indefinite is often restricted by the domain of
discourse, which is often signified in a nearby
context. For now, we will adopt a simple ap-
proach that stipulates that no further resolution
is needed for these types, leaving further discus-
sion to future studies. The resolution strategies
for each type are summarized in (17):
(17) Resolution strategy per null pro-
noun type
i. NP anaphoric: find an NP antecedent
in surrounding text
ii. propositional anaphoric: find a clausal
antecedent in surrounding text
iii. deictic: find the referent among dis-
course entities, usually discourse par-
ticipants
iv. expletive: no further resolution
v. specific indefinite: no further resolution
vi. generic indefinite: no further resolution
We have seen earlier in sections 4.2.1 and
4.2.2 that deictic and generic null pronouns can
be non-anaphoric and anaphoric at the same
time. For such cases, a successful resolution can
occur if such a pronoun is successfully resolved
in either one of the two categories. Take, for
example, the null pronoun subject of the third
sentence in example (16). We can have a res-
olution strategy which views its resolution suc-
cessful (a) if the pronoun is resolved to i (the
speaker), or (b) if the pronoun is resolved to
the subject null pronoun of preceding sentence
2, which is coindexed with the pronoun.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961307692308">
In this paper, I reviewed the cases of dropped
arguments in Korean found in naturally occur-
ring data, and proposed a classification system
and a corresponding annotation scheme. They
are aimed to serve as a basis in creating an an-
notated corpus, which can be used in develop-
ing a reference resolution system for Korean null
pronouns. In particular, a large-scale reference-
annotated corpus built to conform to the syn-
tactic annotation standards of the Korean Tree-
bank will be a valuable resource in developing a
resolution system which employs various statis-
tical techniques.

<abstract confidence="0.99772375">This paper discusses an annotation scheme for Korean null pronouns, which were used in annotating three kinds of Korean text corpora including Penn Korean Treebank. In annotating the corpora, null pronouns and their antecedents were marked up for their type and reference, with coreference relation tracked by numeric identifiers. Based on the annotation scheme, an outline of a potential pronoun resolution strategy is also proposed. The resulting dataset of annotated text is rather small at 11,834 words; we hope the null pronoun classification and annotation scheme proposed in this study will serve as a basis in developing a largescale annotated corpus in the future.</abstract>

These zero arguments are believed to be a substitute for pronouns&apos; and have received terms that reflect such a view throughout the literature, including zero anaphor, zero pronominal, and more theory—specific pro. I adopt the term null pronoun in my paper. Use of null pronouns in a discourse has been believed to be largely governed by discourse principles. In such uses of null pronouns, saliency of their referents in the discourse context is said to play a major role. However, null pronouns are not always anaphoric in terms of the types of reference. In a categorization proposed by Kameyama (1985) for Japanese zero anaphora, three subcategories belong to the type of &amp;quot;text independent use&amp;quot;, which cover non-anaphoric usage of zero pronouns. This classification is given in Table 1.
