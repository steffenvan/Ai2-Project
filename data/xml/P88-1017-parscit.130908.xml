This paper presents a unification-based approach to
Japanese honorifics based on a version of HPSG (Head-driven
Phrase Structure Grammar)111121. Utterance parsing is based
on lexical specifications of each lexical item, including
honorifics, and a few general PSG rules using a parser capable
of unifying cyclic feature structures. It is shown that the
possible word orders of Japanese honorific predicate
constituents can be automatically deduced in the proposed
framework without independently specifying them.
Discourse Information Change Rules (DICRs) that allow
resolving a class of anaphors in honorific contexts are also
formulated.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999519">
Japanese has a rich grammaticalized system of honorifics
to express the speaker&apos;s honorific attitudes toward discourse
agents (i.e. persons who are related to the discourse). As
opposed to such written texts as scientific or newspaper
articles, where the author&apos;s rather &apos;neutral&apos; honorific attitude
is required, in spoken dialogues, an abundant number of
honorific expressions is used and plays an important role in
resolving human zero-anaphors.
In this paper, a unification-based approach to Japanese
honorifics is proposed. First, Mizutani&apos;s theory of honorific
expression actI31 is introduced to define basic honorific
attitude types used in specifying pragmatic constraints on the
use of Japanese honorifics. Then a range of honorifics are
classified into subtypes from a morphological and syntactico-
semantic perspective and examples of their lexical
specifications are shown. The main characteristics of the
utterance parser and an approach to explaining possible
word orders of honorific predicate constituents are described.
Finally, Discourse Information Change Rules are formulated
that resolve a class of anaphors in honorific contexts.

2.1. Grammatical Aspects of Honorifics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974844555555555">
A distinction must be made between the speaker&apos;s
honorific attitude as determined by the utterance situation
(the social relationship between discourse agents, the
atmosphere of the setting, etc), and the honorific attitude as
expressed by special linguistic means independent of the
• utterance situation. For example, by violating a usage
principle for the determination of an honorific attitude (i.e.
one should not exalt oneself in front of others&amp;quot;), uses of an
honorific expression about the speaker himself can function
as a kind of joke. However, without the help of grammatical
properties of honorifics independent of particular utterance
situations, the violation of a usage principle itself could not
be recognized at all, thus the expression could not function as
a joke. Though the former situational determination of
honorific attitude is an interesting subject matter for socio
and psycho-linguistic researchers, the latter grammatical
properties of honorifics are our concern here and what is
described with lexical specifications for honorifics.

2.2. Mizutani&apos;s Theory of Honorific Expression Act
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999477142857143">
Mizutani&apos;s theory of honorific expression act is
introduced to define basic honorific attitude types that
stipulate the pragmatic constraints on Japanese honorifics. In
this model, discourse agents are positioned in an abstract
two-dimensional honorific space (Fig. 1). How they are
positioned is a socio and psycho-linguistic problem, which is
not pursued here.

An honorific expresson act reflects the configuraion of
these discourse agent points. The speaker is set as the point
of origin, and the speaker&apos;s honorific attitude toward a
discourse agent, say P. is defined as the position vector of
point P. The speaker&apos;s honorific attitude toward agent P
relative to agent Q is defined as a vector from point Q to
point P. The value and the direction of the vector are defined
as follows:

dimensional), an across direction can be distinguished from a flat direction.
An across direction of a vector corresponds to the case where no positive
honorific relation between the two agents (i.e. up, clown, or flat) is
recognized by the speaker.
Though the speaker&apos;s honorific attitudes can be
characterized from several viewpoints (e.g. up/down,
distant/close, formal/informal), Mizutani&apos;s model is
appropriate for describing Japanese honorifics because the
up/down aspect most relevantly characterizes Japanese
honorifics. Moreover, it is not clear how the other aspects are
independently grammaticalized in the Japanese honorific
system.
Based on the direction of the vector defined above, the
following four subtypes of honorific attitude relations are
distinguished.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7278599">
In Japanese, words in a wide range of syntactic categories
(i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, nominal-verbs, nominal-
adjectives, etc) are systematically put into their honorific
forms. They are classified into two subtypes according to how
they are derived from their nonhonorific forms.
Classification by the lexical derivation type:
honorific-word =
a. regular-form-honorific-word
(e.g. &amp;quot;o-kak-i&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;kak-i&amp;quot; [writevintli

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998973875">
While regular-form honorific words share a common base
with their nonhonorific forms because they are derived by
the productive honorific-affixation process, irregular-form
honorific words have special word forms that have no direct
connection to their nonhonorific forms. This distiction plays
an important role in the lexical specification of honorifics and
in possible word orders of Japanese honorific predicate
constituents.

3.1.2. Syntactico-Semantic Viewpoint
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996099266666667">
In traditional school grammar, Japanese honorifics have
been classified into three categories: respect words
(&apos;sonkeigo&apos;), condescending words (&apos;kenjougo&apos;), and polite
words (&apos;teineigo&apos;). However, in this traditional tripartite
classification, common features of respect-words and
condescending-words not shared by polite-words are not
explicit That is, while an agent toward whom the speaker&apos;s
honorific attitude is expressed must be grammatically located
in the sentence (i.e. as subject or object) in the case of respect
or condescending words, this requirement does not apply to
polite words. Thus a more elaborate classification is adopted.
Conventional terms are replaced by HaradaI41&apos;s more
syntactico-semantically motivated ones.
Classification by the syntactic role of an aoent to whom the
speaker&apos;s honorific attitude is expressed:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.493996666666667">

(e.g. &apos;sasiage-ru Igivevsenfj)
b. performative-honorific-word (polite-word)
(e.g. &apos;des-u&apos;, &apos;mas-u&apos;)
INA) For example, a verb which takes a nonanimate subject (e.g. &amp;quot;fur-Le
in the sentece &apos;Ame (rain) ga (581) fur-u(fall).° (The rain falls.j) can be put
into its performative honorific form rAme ga fur-i mas-u.&amp;quot;), but not into its
subject honorific form (• &apos;Ame ga o-fur-1 ni nar-u.&amp;quot;). This is in accordance
with the difference between propositional honorifics and performative
honorifics.
(N.B.) There are a class of words which function in between the a.2 and b
types of honorifics (e.g. &amp;quot;mair-u- igokome„,..fl in &apos;8asu ga mair-i mas-u.&amp;quot;
IA bus will come.)). Let us call them propositional-performative-words.
Minus-honorifics are given no place in the traditional
tripartite classification. However, they are classified in our
approach as correponding to the expressed honorific attitude
types.

Because the classfications of honorifics from different
viewpoints as summarized above are cross-categorical, and
thus independent of one another, a single honorific word

irregular-form-honorific-word, subject-honorific-word, and

<listItem confidence="0.721695">

grammatical information is to be specified in a lexicon.
Linguistic word-class generalizations can be formed by
making grammatical categories complex by representing
them with feature-structures.
The specification of verbal category honorifics is
important because the verbal categories are the most
productive in the honorification process, and thus
appropriate to clearly show how diverse aspects of the
Japanese honorific system are described in this approach.

<bodyText confidence="0.999910625">
Regular form honorifics are compositionally analyzed by
giving lexical specifications for each honorific-word
formation formative. For example, most plain-form verbs can
be put into their simple subject-plus-honorific form by
postpositioning the auxiliary verb &amp;quot;(ra)re-rue to them (&amp;quot;re-
ru&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rare-rue are allomorphs of a single morpheme).
Lexical information for these formatives is specified in the

feature-structures. *Speaker is a special global variable bound to a feature
structure representing the speaker&apos;s information.
The &apos;prag&apos; feature describes the pragmatic constraint on
this expression (the &amp;quot;honor-up&apos; relationship from the
speaker to the subject agent of the predicate is required for
this expression to be used in a pragmatically appropriate
way). Description with the &apos;honor-up&apos; honorific attitude
relation shows that this expression is a &apos;plus-honorific&apos;
expression. Structure-sharing of the &apos;goal&apos; feature value of
this honorifc attitude relation with the semantic value of the
predicate&apos;s subject shows that this expression is a &apos;subject-
honorific&apos; expression. The requirement for the &apos;orth&apos; feature
value (lorth) and the &apos;ctype&apos; value in the &apos;subcat&apos; feature
(?predctype) describes the morphophonemic characteristic of
this morpheme by stipulating that &apos;re-(ru)* subcategorize for
either a regular consonant-stem ctype verb or an irregular
ctype verb (&apos;suruldo1), and that &apos;rare-(ru)&apos; subcategorize for
either a regular vowel-stem ctype verb or an irregular ctype

implies that this morph is a bound morph and thus requires its

<bodyText confidence="0.853769342857143">
Next, let us consider a more complicated formation
pattern for deriving a regular object-plus-honorific form. As
productive as the above &amp;quot;Vvong + (ra)re-ru• pattern is, an
&amp;quot;HP + + suru&amp;quot; pattern can put most verbs with two
grammatical human arguments into their corresponding
object honorific forms as follows:
&amp;quot;o + aw-i + sure from &amp;quot;aw-&amp;quot; (meetem),
&amp;quot;go + shoukai + suru&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;shoukai&amp;quot; (introduce-ntem).
KS.) &amp;quot;o-- and &amp;quot;go-&amp;quot; are two forms of a single morpheme (honorific
prefix) that is prefixed to words in a variety of syntactic categories (See
Appendix l). The choice depends on the following element&apos;s origin. If the
element is a Sino-Japanese morpheme (kango). the honorifc prefix takes the
form &amp;quot;go-&amp;quot;; if it is a native one, the honorific prefix is realized as &amp;quot;o-&amp;quot;,
though there are exceptions.
In a naive analysis of Japanese honorifics, these honorific
forms derive from their corresponding plain forms by a simple
object honorification lexical rule that does not take into
account their internal constituent structures (e.g. &amp;quot;aw-u&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;o-aw-i-suru&amp;quot;). Accordingly, this kind of naive analysis is
inadequate for the following reasons:
(a) it is arguable that &amp;quot;HP + Vim&amp;quot; forms a unit in some
structural level before forming the unit &amp;quot;HP + Vmf + sure,
considering the existence of such constructions as
&amp;quot;HP + Vinf ni + nar-u&amp;quot; (normal-sbj-plus-hon-form),
&amp;quot;HP + Vinf negaw-u(request)&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;HP + Vint + itadak-
u(receive-favorirregular-obj-plus-hon-form)&amp;quot;, but this assertion is
not explicitly illustrated in a naive analysis;
(b) though some adverbial postpositions such as &amp;quot;wa&amp;quot;
(contrastive), &amp;quot;mo&amp;quot; (also) and &amp;quot;sae&amp;quot; (even) can appear inside
the object honorific form (e.g. &amp;quot;o-aw-i-WA-suru&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;go-
shoukai-SAE-MO-suru&amp;quot;), it is difficult to derive these forms by
a naive analysis in light of the generalization concerning
adverbial postpositions appearing in other environments
(e.g. &amp;quot;Sensei ga kyoositu DAKE e WA ko rare ta&amp;quot; (the teacher
came only to the classroom));
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.51894875">
(c) a naive analysis fails to explain the kind of the elements
that can operate as a \lin/ element in the pattern, which is
automatically explained in the proposed framework as will be
shown in section S.

The &apos;headlcoh(Category0fHead)&apos; feature of a category
specifies the kind of its head. An HP can take a lexical
infinitive-form verb whose &apos;can-take-hp&apos; value is &apos; +. An HP is
assigned its appropriate realization fore&apos;) (in this case, &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;
form), because its &apos;orth&apos; value and the head&apos;s &apos;hpform&apos; value
are the same. The first equation in the rule statement
prevents a second application of the honorific prefixation
rule to the same verb (&amp;quot;o-o-aw-i&amp;quot;) by specifying that the
mother category&apos;s &apos;can-take-hp&apos; feature value be &apos;-&apos;.&amp;quot;) The
other equations in the rule are ones common to the adjunct-
head structures.
1*NA] A note is needed here concerning the realization of HP. When the
adjacent feature of the second right-hand-side symbol in the CM-part is nil
as in the above case, it is enough just to concatenate both &apos;orth&apos; feature
values of the right-hand-side symbols and make it the &amp;quot;orth&apos; feature value of
the left-hand-side symbol. However, when the head element&apos;s adjacent
feature has a nonnull value (i.e. in the case that the head element is a bound
morph), a more complicted operation is needed. But here we only mention
its necessity and avoid its precise formulation to save space.
1••N.B.) The &apos;can-take-hp&apos; feature is specified as &apos;-&apos; not only for already HP-
prefixed elements, but also for almost all irregular form honorific verbs (e.g.
*&amp;quot;o-osshar-risay1, •&amp;quot;o-itadak-ilreceive-favorl) and most mono-syllablic
infinitive-form verbs that have corresponding irregular-form honorifics (e.g.
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;o-si- Idol, &amp;quot;&apos;&amp;quot;o-mi&amp;quot; hook at1).
Next, the usual complement-head structure rule (Fig 3.d)
is applied to the resulting feature structure for &amp;quot;o-aw-i&amp;quot; and
the feature structure for a normal object-plus honorification
formative (&amp;quot;-suru&amp;quot;, as shown in Fig 3.e). Thus the normal
object plus honorifc form (o-aw-i-(suru)) for &amp;quot;aw-(meet) is
obtained in a compositional way.

Irregular form honorifics share most of their lexical
information with their nonhonorific counterparts. In our
framework, redundant lexical specification for irregular-form
honorifics is avoided by using lexical inheritance mechanism
from their superclasses. For example, the necessary lexical
specification for the irregular subject honorific form &amp;quot;(-
te)itadak- of the donatory auxiliary verb &amp;quot;(-te)moraw-&amp;quot; is
reduced, as shown in Fig 4.a. This turns out to be equivalent
to Fig 4.b by unifying pieces of information from its super-
classes, te-receive-favor and obj-plus-hon.

Fig 5 shows the organization of the unification-based CFG

and unifies feature structures in its completion process. The
description of grammatical rules and lexical items are
complied into feature structures by the rule reader.
Unification of cyclic feature structuers might be necessary
to analyze certain expressions. To give some examples:

(b) the polite form (&amp;quot;gozar-&amp;quot;) of the verb &amp;quot;ar-&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;ir-- (to be)

In describing the above linguistic phenemena, it is convenient
if requirements for its head category can be specified not only
for adjunct elements, but also for complement elements. In
such cases, one more equation as follows needs to be added
to the usual head-complement structure rule statement
shown in Fig 3.d.

5. Word Order of Honorific Predicate Constituents
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.855998615384616">
In Japanese, a verbal predicate is composed of one main
verb and postpositioned auxiliary verbs (though possibly
none exist). Because both main verbs and auxiliary verbs may
have honorific forms, various sequences of honorifics might
be expected to occur in a predicate as a simple matter of
possible combinations. However, their possible word orders
are restricted by a grammatical principles. Traditionally,
possibile word orders were described in detail and the
Fig 6. Cyclic part of the compiled feature structure
explanations for them were given from a rather speculative
perspective. In this research, it is shown how possible word
orders can be deduced from lexical specifications of
honorifics.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.96407">
5.1. Propositional and Performative Honorifics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.929140411764706">
A propositional honorific formative always precedes a
performative honorific formative. For example, though
&apos;awe-re-mane (ffirneetvongl-SbjPlusHonl-PerformativeHon1)
and &apos;o-awi-si-mase (U[HP-meetvind-ObjPlusHonj-
PerformativeHonD are possible expressions, they would be
impossible if their word orders were reversed (i.e.
performative honorific placed before propositional
honorific).
This restriction on word order is considered a
consequence of the lexical specifications for both types of
honorifics. As shown in section 3, propositional
honorification formatives subcategorize a verbal category
whose subject (and object) elements are not filled yet as its
adjacent element. On the other hand, a performative
honorification formative subcategorizes a verbal category
with saturated subcategorization. This represents the lexical
specification for -mane.

honorification formative &amp;quot;-(ra)rerte that requires its object to
be already filled cannot, therefore, precede the normal
subject plus honorification formative on account of
conflicting specifications for the &apos;subcat&apos; value. Otherwise,
no conflict exist.
Other kinds of restrictions on the possible word order of
Japanese honorific predicate constituents can likewise be

6. Anaphora Resolution in Honorific Contexts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999451272727273">
In Japanese honorific contexts, many human anaphors
can be resolved by recourse to pragmatic constraints on the
use of honorifics. This is an attempt to apply DR theory to the
anaphora resolution in Japanse honorific contexts.
Discourse information is represented by a feature
structure consisting of a set of reference markers (Universe)
and a set of conditions, as in the standard version of DR
(Discourse Representation) theory171. Fig 8.a is the initially
posited DRS (Discourse Representation Structure). Addition
of other discourse information to the initial DRS does not
affect the theory.
