In the past few years, knowledge management
(KM) has received increasing attention from
industry, academia, and government. Effective
KM is often cited as a key capability for
competitive advantage for global enterprises.
Human language technology (HLT) plays a
central role in KM, as this article aims to
elucidate.

2 Knowledge Management
Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889">
Knowledge Management is the field of
enhancing organizational performance through
organizational knowledge sharing, learning, and
application of expertise. As an indicator of the
importance of knowledge management, many
corporations that traditionally measured only the
financial aspects of value are beginning to
measure human and intellectual value as well.
Knowledge management can be enabled by a
range of human language technologies including
but not limited to enhanced information
retrieval, extraction, summarization, and
presentation/generation. Moreover, human
language technologies promise to both enhance
human’s access to information as well as to
enhance their interaction with one another such
as by increasing their awareness of knowledge
artifacts or activities intersecting their interests.
Key elements of KM include cataloguing
existing knowledge, discovering expertise, and
creation of new knowledge, which we briefly
discuss in turn.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968999">
2.1 Knowledge Mapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999585">
Often times a primary issue for organizations is
knowing what they know. Even providing easy
access to explicitly captured knowledge in
artifacts such as written policies, strategies,
documents, and presentations can provide
individuals in organizations with tremendous
power and efficiency. Often, however, so much
material is created in an organization that its
effective organization is daunting. Tools are
required that can automatically generate
classifications and/or taxonomies of explicit
corporate and world knowledge. The success of
services such as Yahoo, Northernlight, and
Quiver illustrate the value of (and limitations of)
current classification-based collections and
collaborative filtering approaches.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996096">
2.2 Expert and Community Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808454545455">
Knowing who to call, who knows a key fact, or
who has the know-how or the skill to analyze,
diagnose, or recommend in a particular domain
is a challenge. Traditional manually-created
corporate skills databases are costly,
inconsistent across individuals and disciplines,
and become rapidly obsolete. Finding experts or
communities of experts rapidly can be a
competitive advantage for a company. Indeed, it
is a key function of new business models of
virtual corporations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999836">
2.3 Knowledge Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934375">
Knowledge discovery is the facilitation of end
users or communities of experts directly or
collectively in discovering answers to their
questions. Accomplishing this can include
question answering, discovery of new
knowledge through machine learning or data
mining, and ultimately new knowledge learning,
including ontology induction.
</bodyText>

3 Preliminary Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953471698113">
Human language technologies have already been
applied to some key knowledge management
areas (Bontcheva 2001). For example, Becerra-
Fernandez (2001) reports on NASA’s expert
finder. In our research we have created systems
which automatically extract and correlate
information from human created artifacts to
create assessments of human expertise
(Maybury, D’Amore, House, D., 2000). For
example, Figure 1 illustrates the screen
MITRE’s Expert Finder (also called People
Finder) generates after a user types in the
keywords “machine translation”. Expert Finder
processes employee published resumes and
documents as well as corporate newsletters that
mention individual’s names in the context of this
topic (using named entity extraction) to
automatically create expertise profiles for each
employee. Expert Finder then presents a rank-
ordered list of employees whose expertise
profile best matches this query.
In spite of low inter-human agreement in
determining expertise, an empirical evaluation
comparing ten technical human resource
managers’ performance with Expert Finder on
five specialty areas (data mining, chemicals,
human computer interaction, network security,
and collaboration) demonstrated that Expert
Finder performed at approximately 60%
precision and 40% recall when appropriate data
was available. This is sufficient performance to
find an expert within one phone call, which was
the original knowledge management objective.
While we mentioned in Section 2.1 the value of
taxonomic search engines, another area of
preliminary success is in knowledge discovery.
Several research groups are working to create
more effective means to access multimedia
information sources (Maybury 2000). Figure 2
illustrates MITRE’s Broadcast News Nagivator
(BNN), the culmination of many years of
research and an integration of multiple human
language and other technologies (Merlino et al.
1997). BNN applies speech, language, and
image processing methods to segment, extract,
and summarize broadcast news sources to
enable personalized and targeted search of the
news. Figure 2 shows the user querying stories
from all sources for the last two weeks (19 April
to 3 May 2001 at the time of writing) containing
the keyword &amp;quot;aegis&amp;quot; and the location &amp;quot;Taiwan&amp;quot;.
People, organization, and locations menus are
dynamically generated from extracted entities.

in Figure 3, BNN presents a quick skim
including a keyframe and the top 3 named
entities for each retrieved story. Clicking on any
of the keyframes brings the user to that story.
Clicking on any of the named entities (people,
places, organizations) brings the user to all
stories mentioning that name. Using document
clustering techniques, BNN further provides
users with quick access to related stories. An
extension of this system automatically mines
correlations among named entities that appear
across stories to detect and track novel topics.

4 HLT for KM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999800333333333">
Having considered the needs of knowledge
management and some preliminary promise of
human language technology to provide solutions
to these needs, we now more systematically
analyze how HLT can contribute to KM. Table
1 outlines a range of functional areas of human
language technology that offer potential
solutions to some of the elements required to
enable knowledge management. We consider
the following ten areas in turn: input analysis,
information retrieval, information extraction,
question answering, translation, dialogue
management, user modeling, summarization,
presentation generation and awareness/
collaboration.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988178">
4.1 Input Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891866666667">
Analysis of user spoken language and natural
input is key to knowledge access. This is
essential for applications such as natural
language interfaces to databases, question and
answering, and multimedia interfaces.
Challenges include dealing with imprecise,
ambiguous, and/or partial input. Addressing
these challenges in multimodal (e.g., text,
speech, and gesture) and/or multiplatform
(desktop, kiosk, mobile) interfaces provides
additional challenges. Input mechanisms that are
intuitive as well as user and situation adaptable
or automatically adaptive promise to mitigate
complexity and increase broad availability of
knowledge access.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.899789">
4.2 Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964230769231">
The ability to leverage the above advances in
input processing (especially query processing)
together with advances in content-based access
to multimedia artifacts (e.g., text, audio,
imagery, video) promises to enhance the
richness and breadth of accessible material
while at the same time improving retrieval
precision and recall. Dealing with noisy, large
scale, and multimedia data from sources as
diverse as radio, television, documents, web
pages, and human conversations (e.g., chat
sessions and speech transcriptions) will offer
challenges.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996079">
4.3 Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999720142857143">
Extraction is the ability to identify and cull out
objects and events from multimedia sources
(text, audio, video). An example challenge
includes extracting entities within media and
correlating those across media. For example,
this might include extracting names or locations
from written/spoken sources and correlating
those with associated images. Whereas
commercial products exist to extract named
entities from text with precision and recall in the
ninetieth percentile, domain independent event
extractors work at best in the fiftieth percentile
and performance degrades further with noisy,
corrupted, or idiosyncratic data.

4.4 Question Answering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962825">
Drawing upon techniques from query
processing, retrieval and presentation, an
important new class of systems will move us
from our current form of search on the web
(type in keywords to retrieve documents) to a
more direct form of asking questions which are
then directly responded to with an extracted
answer. Challenges will include source
selection, source segmentation, extraction, and
semantic integration across heterogeneous
sources of unstructured, structured, and semi-
structured data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.937034">
4.5 Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964384615385">
Last year, for the first time, English constituted
less than half the material on the web. Some
predict that Chinese will be the primary
language of the web by 2007. Given that
information on the web will increasingly appear
in foreign languages and not all users will be
fluent in those languages, there will be a need to
gist or skim content for relevance assessment
and/or provide high quality translation for
deeper understanding. New innovative
applications include the translation of
multilingual conversations (e.g., multilingual
chat).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992441">
4.6 Dialogue Management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969">
Knowledge workers will require systems that
can support natural, mixed initiative human
computer interaction that deals robustly with
context shift, interruptions, feedback, and shift
of locus of control. Open research challenges
include the ability to tailor flow and control of
interactions and facilitate interactions including
error detection and correction tailored to
individual physical, perceptual and cognitive
differences. Motivational and engaging life-like
agents offer promising opportunities for
innovation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980745">
4.7 Agent/User Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999253916666667">
Computers can construct models of user beliefs,
goals and plans as well as models of users’
individual and collective skills by processing
materials such as documents or user
interactions/conversations. While raising
important privacy issues, modeling users or
groups of users unobtrusively from public
materials or conversations can enable a range of
important knowledge management capabilities.
For example, this might include expertise
databases which can be used to enhance
organizational awareness and efficiency.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997163">
4.8 Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839307692308">
Summarization aims to select content and
condense it to present a compact form of the
original source or sources. Summaries can be an
extraction of or abstraction from original source
material as well as informative, indicative or
evaluative in purpose. Some challenges include
multimedia, multilingual and cross document
summarization. Addressing scaleability to large
collections and user-tailored or purpose-tailored
summaries are active areas of research.
Summarization will enable knowledge workers
access to larger amounts of material with less
required reading time.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996391">
4.9 Presentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993848">
Effective presentations require the appropriate
selection of content, allocation to media, and
fine grained coordination and realization in time
and space. Discovery and presentation of
knowledge may require mixed media (e.g., text,
graphics, video, speech and non-speech audio)
and mixed mode (e.g., linguistic, visual,
auditory) displays tailored to the user and
context. This might include tailoring content
and form to the specific physical, perceptual, or
cognitive characteristics of the user. It might
lead to new visualization and browsing
paradigms for massive multimedia and
multilingual repositories that reduce cognitive
load or task time, increase analytic depth and
breatdh, or simply increase user satisfaction. A
grand challenge is the automated generation of
coordinated speech, natural language, gesture,
animation, non-speech audio, generation,
possibly delivered via interactive, animated life-
like agents. Preliminary experiments suggest
that, independent of task performance, agents
may simply be more engaging/motivating to
younger and/or less experienced users (André
2000).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.486971">
4.10 Awareness and Collaboration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932545454545">
Our gobal web provides unprecedented
opportunity for world wide collaboration, both
asynchronously and sychronously. Users will
need enhanced awareness of both emerging
knowledge and of one another’s expertise. One
such aid is the detection and tracking of topics
of interest to facilitate discovery and connection
among communities of interest. Another is the
creation of expertise profiles based on publically
available information (e.g., publications,
interviews, public conversations).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999598035714286">
Human language technology promises to deliver
great value to the challenge of knowledge
management. As discussed, many fundamental
scientific and technical challenges will need to
be addressed to ensure that value accrues. These
include:
Heterogeneity – Dealing with the diverse nature
of human language artifacts, both in form and in
(semantic) content.
Scalability – Addressing the size of corporate
collections and global content.
Portability – Creating adaptive methods (e.g.,
corpus-based machine learning approaches) that
enable rapid retargetting of algorithms to new
languages and media.
Complexity – Ensuring that the many content
forms and presentational methods and devices
do not overwhelm end users.
Security – Ensuring authentication to control
access to source materials and/or ensuring the
identity/integrity of source materials.
Privacy – Addressing the legal and social issues
of maintaining privacy and user control of a
user’s model extracted from public user
materials or interactions.
Overcoming these HLT challenges will be
essential to the advancement of knowledge
management.

Facilities include spoken query processing, visual query analysis (e.g., sketching), mixed media query (e.g., text and graphics) Natural (written, spoken, gestural) access to information and knowledge. Decrease in access complexity or user training. Broaden availability of knoweldge to users. Retrieval Natural language processing of queries and documents. Content-based retrieval of text, imagery, audio, video. Enhancements to document retrieval precision and recall. Direct access to media, easing navigational burden of user. Reduction of search time. Extraction Segmentation, object and event identification, and extraction from multimedia sources (text, audio, video). Direct access to information or knowledge elements including specific types that may be user preferred. Reuse of media elements enabling user tailored selection or presentations. Question Answering Question analysis, response discovery and generation from heterogeneous sources. Overcome time, memory or attention limitations required to sift through many returned web pages from a traditional search by providing direct answers to questions. Translation Rapid creation of translingual corpora. Effective translingual retrieval, summarization, and translation. Access Verbalization of graphics, Visualization of text. Cross media/mode information and knowledge access enabling broader access to global information sources using methods such as translingual information retrieval. Dialogue Management Mixed initiative natural interaction that deals robustly with context shift, interruptions, feedback, and shift of locus of control Ability to tailor flow and control of interactions and facilitate interactions. Includes error detection and correction tailored to individual physical, perceptual and cognitive differences. Motivational and engaging life-like agents. Agent/User Modeling Unobtrusive learning, representation, and use of characteristics, beliefs, goals and plans of agents (including the user). Enables tracking of user characteristics, skills and goals in order to enhance interaction as well as discovery of experts by other users or agents. Summarization Scaleability, cross-linguality, multimedia summarization. Increasing speed of reviewing materials. Multimedia summarization, cross-lingual summarization, large multi-document summarization. Presentation Generation Automated generation of coordinated speech, natural language, gesture, animation, non-speech audio, generation, possibly delivered via interactive, animated life-like agents (includes challenges of media selection, allocation, coordination and realization) Mixed media (e.g., text, graphics, video, speech and non-speech audio) and mode (e.g., linguistic, visual, auditory) displays tailored to the user and context. Agents engaging/motivating to younger and/or less experienced users. Awareness and Collaboration Topic detection and tracking, placebased asychronous and sychronous collaboration environments. Enhance awareness of new knowledge as well as other user’s interests and expertise and the ability of experts to exchange/integrate knowledge. 4.4 Question Answering Drawing upon techniques from query processing, retrieval and presentation, an important new class of systems will move us from our current form of search on the web (type in keywords to retrieve documents) to a more direct form of asking questions which are then directly responded to with an extracted answer. Challenges will include source selection, source segmentation, extraction, and semantic integration across heterogeneous sources of unstructured, structured, and semistructured data. 4.5 Translation Last year, for the first time, English constituted less than half the material on the web. Some predict that Chinese will be the primary language of the web by 2007. Given that information on the web will increasingly appear in foreign languages and not all users will be fluent in those languages, there will be a need to gist or skim content for relevance assessment and/or provide high quality translation for deeper understanding. New applications include the translation of multilingual conversations (e.g., multilingual chat). 4.6 Dialogue Management Knowledge workers will require systems that can support natural, mixed initiative human computer interaction that deals robustly with context shift, interruptions, feedback, and shift of locus of control. Open research challenges include the ability to tailor flow and control of interactions and facilitate interactions including error detection and correction tailored to individual physical, perceptual and cognitive differences. Motivational and engaging life-like agents offer promising opportunities for innovation. 4.7 Agent/User Modeling Computers can construct models of user beliefs, goals and plans as well as models of users’ individual and collective skills by processing materials such as documents or user interactions/conversations. While important privacy issues, modeling users or groups of users unobtrusively from public materials or conversations can enable a range of important knowledge management capabilities. For example, this might include expertise databases which can be used to enhance organizational awareness and efficiency. 4.8 Summarization Summarization aims to select content and condense it to present a compact form of the original source or sources. Summaries can be an extraction of or abstraction from original source material as well as informative, indicative or evaluative in purpose. Some challenges include multimedia, multilingual and cross document summarization. Addressing scaleability to large collections and user-tailored or purpose-tailored summaries are active areas of research. Summarization will enable knowledge workers access to larger amounts of material with less required reading time. 4.9 Presentation Effective presentations require the appropriate selection of content, allocation to media, and fine grained coordination and realization in time and space. Discovery and presentation of knowledge may require mixed media (e.g., text, graphics, video, speech and non-speech audio) and mixed mode (e.g., linguistic, visual, auditory) displays tailored to the user and context. This might include tailoring content and form to the specific physical, perceptual, or cognitive characteristics of the user. It might lead to new visualization and browsing paradigms for massive multimedia and multilingual repositories that reduce cognitive load or task time, increase analytic depth and breatdh, or simply increase user satisfaction. A grand challenge is the automated generation of coordinated speech, natural language, gesture, animation, non-speech audio, generation, possibly delivered via interactive, animated lifelike agents. Preliminary experiments suggest that, independent of task performance, agents may simply be more engaging/motivating to younger and/or less experienced users (André 2000). 4.10 Awareness and Collaboration Our gobal web provides unprecedented opportunity for world wide collaboration, both asynchronously and sychronously. Users will need enhanced awareness of both emerging knowledge and of one another’s expertise. One such aid is the detection and tracking of topics of interest to facilitate discovery and connection among communities of interest. Another is the creation of expertise profiles based on publically available information (e.g., publications, interviews, public conversations). and Conclusion Human language technology promises to deliver great value to the challenge of knowledge management. As discussed, many fundamental scientific and technical challenges will need to be addressed to ensure that value accrues. These include: Dealing with the diverse nature of human language artifacts, both in form and in (semantic) content. Addressing the size of corporate collections and global content. Creating adaptive methods (e.g., corpus-based machine learning approaches) that enable rapid retargetting of algorithms to new languages and media. Ensuring that the many content forms and presentational methods and devices do not overwhelm end users. Ensuring authentication to control access to source materials and/or ensuring the identity/integrity of source materials. Addressing the legal and social issues of maintaining privacy and user control of a user’s model extracted from public user materials or interactions. Overcoming these HLT challenges will be essential to the advancement of knowledge management.</abstract>
