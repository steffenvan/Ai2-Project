<bodyText confidence="0.9995625">
Knowledge of the behavior of words and text in other languages has recently been used
to help solving tasks in a first language. An example of such a task is word-sense
disambiguation by using translations in a second language. Another example is verb
classification by studying properties of verbs in several languages.
A second modality of knowledge transfer across languages is to take advantage of
resources already built for English and for a few other resource-rich languages. These resources
have been used to induce knowledge in languages for which few linguistic resources are
available. This was made possible by the wider availability of parallel corpora and better
alignment methods at paragraph, sentence, and word level. Examples of such knowledge
induction tasks are learning morphology, part-of-speech tags and grammatical gender. Cross-
language knowledge transfer has also been possible thanks to the development of wordnets
aligned to the original Princeton WordNet.
This workshop provides a forum for discussion between leading names and researchers
involved in cross-language applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
applications that exploit parallel corpora (learning morphological segmentation; learning part-
of-speech; learning grammatical gender; other applications); induction of knowledge from a
language for which resources are abundant to another language for which fewer resources are
available; using other languages to solve a task in a first language (word-sense disambiguation
by using translations in other languages; verb classification by studying verb properties in
several languages; other tasks of this kind); identifying and using cognate words between
languages; building wordnets by knowledge transfer; and exploiting multi-language wordnets
for NLP applications.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers for the hard work that went
behind their submissions. We express our deepest gratitude to the committee members for their
thorough reviews. We also thank the EACL 2006 organizers for their help with administrative
matters.
