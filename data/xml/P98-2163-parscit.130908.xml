Abstract
This paper describes a method for recognizing coher-
ence relations between clauses which are linked by te
in Japanese — a translational equivalent of English
and. We consider that the coherence relations are
categories each of which has a prototype structure
as well as the relationships among them. By utiliz-
ing this organization of the relations, we can infer an
appropriate relation from the semantic structures of
the clauses between which that relation holds. We
carried out an experiment and obtained the correct
recognition ratio of 82% for the 280 sentences.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98973511904762">
One of the basic requirements for understanding dis-
course is recognizing how each clause coheres with
its predecessor. Our linguistic and pragmatic com-
petence enables us to read in conceivable relations
even when two clauses are copresent without any
overt cues, i.e., in parataxis.
There has been a variety of definitions for coher-
ence relations (see (Hovy and Maier, 1993) for a
survey). However, the definitions are rather vague
and they are often recognized to be underspecified
(Moore and Pollack, 1992; Fukumoto and Tsujii,
1994). This paper attempts to explicate how such
coherence relations arise between segments of dis-
course. We focus on te-linkage in Japanese — a
translational equivalent of English and-linkage, since
mere parataxis ranges over too widely to capture the
underlying principles on the coherence relations.
We consider that coherence relations are cate-
gories each of which has its prototypical instances
and marginal ones. As with all instances of catego-
rizations, the prototypical cases of each relation are
clearly distinguishable from one another. In some
cases, however, it is often hard to make clear argu-
ment for a relation being one rather than another.
In addition, these relations themselves are hierar-
chically organized according to their specificity. By
considering the prototype of each relation, we can in-
fer an appropriate relation from the semantic struc-
tures of the segments between which that relation
holds.
2 Categorization of Te-linkage
Traditionally, te-constructions have been divided
into three categories according to the function of
te: (i) as a non-productive derivational suffix; (ii)
as a linker joining a main verb with a so-called aux-
iliary to form a complex predicate; and (iii) as a
linker connecting two phrases or clauses. Since the
derivatives and the auxiliaries are relatively fixed
compared with the third category, we concentrate
on the third category in this paper.
Japanese te, like English and, is used to express a
diverse range of coherence relations as shown belowl.

When such a relation is understood to be intended
by the speaker, it is always inferable solely from the
conjuncts themselves.
Although te-linkage exhibits an extreme degree of
semantic nonspecificity, it is nonetheless very com-
mon in actual usage2and does not cause problem in
communication. We will see how such diversity of
relations arise in the next section.

3 Organization of the Coherence
Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981997952380952">
Although the semantic relations between the te-
linked constituents are diverse, not all relations im-
plicated by parataxis can be expressed by te-linkage
(Hasegawa, 1996). For example, if the clauses equiv-
alent to I sat down and The door opened are pre-
sented paratactically in Japanese, the interpreter
naturally reads in a Temporal Sequence relation, just
as in English. But this relation is not an available in-
terpretation when the clauses are linked by te. That
is, among the relations potentially implicated by two
copresent clauses, some are filtered out by te-linkage.
We presume that the inherent meaning of te is
&amp;quot;togetherness.&amp;quot; The only relations that fit with this
meaning are possible to arise within te-linkage. The
notion of &amp;quot;togetherness&amp;quot; can be divided into two cat-
egories according to the temporal properties of re-
lations. One in parallel and the other in series. In
the former, two events occur simultaneously or two
20n the basis of a corpus of 3,330 multi-predicate sen-
tences sampled from various types of text, Saeki (Saeki,
1975) reports a total of 26 connectives (1,047 tokens al-
together), of which te holds the foremost rank: it occurs
512 times, while the second most frequent connective,
ga, occurs only 141 times. According to Inoue (Inoue,
1983), te appears most frequently in spontaneous speech
(34.5% of all connectives) and in informal writing (27%).
In formal writing such as newspaper editorials, te ranks
second (17.2%) after ren&apos;yoo linkage (36.9%). The actual
occurrence of te is much more frequent than these num-
bers suggest, because these data do not include cases in
which the second predicate is a so-called auxiliary.
states hold at the same time, while in the latter, two
events occur successively.
These two categories are further divided into
smaller categories according to the event structures
of conjuncts. The category of sequential relations
contains both Cause-Effect and Temporal Sequence.
When two events which are linked solely by temporal
sequentiality are expressed via te-linkage, the con-
juncts must share an agentive subject. Thus, causa-
tion and one person&apos;s volitional acts are sufficient to
be recognized as togetherness.
On the other hand, in order for the category of
parallel occurrence of events to be compatible with
te-linkage, they must be homogeneous in some sense.
One such example is the case where a thing has two
different properties (Additive) and another is the
cases where two different things have similar prop-
erties or are engaged in similar events (Contrast).
As for the Additive relation, the subject of the sec-
ond conjunct is often omitted since it is the same as
that of the first. In addition, both predicates of the
conjuncts are stative — adjectives or stative verbs
— because they have no temporal boundaries as op-
posed to events and can easily hold at the same time
within one person. As for the Contrast relation, the
subjects of the conjuncts must be different from each
other and hence both of them are explicitly men-
tioned (often marked with the contrastive wa). In
general, the similarities of the predicates appear as
the syntactic parallelism as the example (6) shows.
The other sub-category of the parallel occurrence
of events is &amp;quot;accompaniment,&amp;quot; where the second
clause is foregrounded and the first backgrounded.
The prototypical instance of this category is the case
where the first clause denotes a state and the second
an event, since we have a tendency to focus on a
changing event rather than stable state. Thus, the
Circumstance relation composes this category. The
cases where the first clause denotes some manner
of event are also contained in this category, since a
manner accompanies an event.
The notion of the manner is continuous to the
means since the means and manner of an event are
often coextensive in that the means of an event often
determines the manner of the event. This is exem-
plified by English with as well as Japanese de, which
are used both as an instrumental or means marker
and as a marker of manner (How is similarly poly-
semous) (Goldberg, 1996).
The Means-End relation is also continuous to cau-
sation, since the means can be interpreted as a kind
of causation. This is exemplified by Japanese doosite
(why/how) as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8182872">
(18) doo-site kitano?
&amp;quot;Why/How did you come?&amp;quot; Answer:
(18a) densya-de (means)

<bodyText confidence="0.993150769230769">
&amp;quot;since (I) want to meet (you)&amp;quot;
(18b) expresses the reason why the speaker came to
the hearer — &amp;quot;the wish to meet the hearer caused
him/her to come.&amp;quot; Thus, this relation associates the
two extremes i.e., parallelism and sequentiality.
Finally, the Concession is closely related to both
Cause and Contrast. In the Concession relation, the
first clause implies something and the second clause
denys it. The implied states or events are often those
to be caused by the events or states denoted by the
first clause, and then denied and contrast with the
second clause.

4.1 Overview

<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
Theoretically, it is more likely that when we have
heard/read the first clause and te, we narrow down
the possible relations by inferring the content of the
second clause. For example, if the first clause de-
notes an action, we will infer what is caused by the
action or another action which may follow the action
— that is, Cause or Temporal Sequence will be ex-
pected. On the other hand, if the first clause denotes
a state, Circumstance or Additive will be expected.
In practice, however, we have both clauses at hand.
Therefore, we adopt the following algorithm:

conjuncts by reverse linking

mapping open arguments — i.e., variables of seman-
tic structures whose referents can be expressed syn-
tactically by a phrase within the same clause as the
predicate — onto grammatical functions or under-
lying syntactic configurations by virtue of thematic
roles (thematic roles are positions in a structured
semantic representation). In the case of Japanese,
they are triggered by case particles. In STEP2,
the verb&apos;s semantic structures are invoked and uni-
fied with the outputs of STEP1. The examples of
the linking rules and verbs&apos; semantic structures are
shown in Figure 2 and 3 respectively.
However, since the real texts contain far more
complexity and ambiguity than the examples given
in this paper, we have to correct the outputs of the
processes manually (the gapped arguments are filled
by hand). We now focus on the processes that cal-
culate the coherence relations.

4.2 The Properties Relevant to the
Coherence Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799857142857">
What is essential for recognizing the coherence rela-
tion between clauses is that the constituents of one
clause bear certain kind of structural relationship to
those of the other. Although there are an infinite
number of situations, there seems to be only a small
number of properties relevant to the coherence rela-
tions that can hold between them. They are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8400315">
1) the identity and agentivity of the subjects in
the two clauses
2) the thematic and aspectual properties of the
event denoted by each clause
3) canonical events associated with the noun that
is relevant to both clauses
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976952">
Before going through the use of these properties,
let&apos;s consider the other information which affects our
construal of the relations.
There are some adverbials or fixed expressions
which coerce the interpretation into the specific re-
lation. In addition, there are narrow-range verb
classes which specialize the implicated relation by
virtue of their inherent meaning. For example,
verbs that take a temporal NP as the subject and
means &amp;quot;the passage of time&amp;quot; such as sugiru(pass
away), tatu(go by), keikasuru(elapse), etc., imply
the Temporal Sequence relation when followed by te.
Verbs that express &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; such as tukau(use), siy-
ousuru(make use of), katuyousuru(apply), etc., im-
ply the Means-End relation. They are summarized
in Table 1. In Table 1, [TE] means temporal ex-
pressions such as days, months, years, centuries, etc.
The verbs and fixed expressions appear in the first
clause, while the adverbials in the second. These
fixed expressions should be listed as a unit in the
lexicon.
When these expressions appear in the test sen-
tences, we can identify the relation regardless of the
procedure described below. Otherwise, we have re-
course to the aforementioned properties.

4.3 The Prototypes and the Extensions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940705882353">
In the previous study, We have classified verbs into
30 semantic categories, and for each category we
have given a lexical conceptual structure (LOS) rep-
resentation (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997). Since the
LCS representation involves lexical decomposition
(Jackendoff, 1990), we can utilize the verb internal
semantic structure so as to calculate coherence rela-
tions in a farely principled way.
As mentioned in the introduction, we consider
each relation as a category. Categories cannot be
defined in terms of necessary and sufficient condi-
tions, but rather each instance is categorized accord-
ing to its similarity to the prototypes of the cate-
gories (Rosch, 1973; Lakoff, 1987; Taylor, 1989).
We define a prototypical structure for each rela-
tion by means of the predicates used in the LCSs as
follows:

Here, WITH, AND, THEN, etc., are mnemonic
names for the relations and each can be considered
as a function that takes two events or states as its
arguments and returns a coherent event or state.
We use the infix notation for each function rather
than prefix. The square brackets identify the se-
mantic structure of a clause and their subscripts de-
notes the surface ordering of the clauses linked by te.
ACT, BE, GO, and BECOME are also functions and
they correspond to actions, states, movement, and
inchoatives respectively. They express broad-range
classes of the events which are constructed by the
previous steps (see Figure 3). The whole structures
incorporate the identity between the subjects of two
clauses by the variables x and y. Agentivity of each
subject is implied by the types of the events: ACT
&gt; GO &gt; BECOME &gt; BE.
Often, these prototypical structures are lexical-
ized and expressed by a single clause. For example,
the Cause-Effect relation is lexicalized into accom-
plishment verbs (Talmy, 1985) and the Means-End
relation can be expressed by an adjunct event noun
followed by the case particle de. They must be ex-
tended so that they can cover wider range of in-
stances of te-linkage. The result of the extension is
shown in Table 2 (for cases each of which shares a
subject) and Table 3 (for cases each of which has
distinct subjects), where each column corresponds
to the type of the event in the first clause and each
row to the second. The prototypes are boldfaced
and they are extended to the other boxes with some
directions and constraints.
For example, the Temporal Sequence relation has
a prototype structure, which is roughly read as
&amp;quot;someone goes to somewhere, and then he/she goes
(from there) to elsewhere.&amp;quot; This expresses our com-
mon sense that one person cannot move along two
different paths at the same time, which implys that
the two movements by a person must be sequential.
This prototype is extended so as to cover such sit-
uations as &amp;quot;someone goes to somewhere, and then
he/she does something/becomes something/stays
there&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;someone does something/become some-
thing/stays somewhere, and then he/she goes to else-
where.&amp;quot; They are expressed by vertical and hori-
zontal extensions of the prototype in Table 2. The

movements involved in these situations are loca-
tional and the other events must be done volitionally
by the same person. Another extension covers sit-
uations where &amp;quot;someone does something, and then
he/she does something else.&amp;quot; This is based on the
fact that one person cannot generally engage in two
actions at the same time. Of course, any type of
events may occur sequentially. However, there ex-
ists the constraint on the fitness with te-linkage as
mentioned in the previous section.
The explanation for the other relations is detailed
in (Oishi, 1998).
As a result of the extensions, many boxes have
two or more relations. Notice that the nearer re-
lations in the organization tend to be in the same
boxes. To discriminate among them, we specify for
each combination of event types such algorithm as
follows (below, /(i,j) means that two clauses share
an subject and D(i,j) means that two clauses have
distinct subjects, where i is the event type of the
first clause and j the second):

On the other hand, there remain some boxes
blank. They should be resolved by using the third
property — the canonical events associated with the
noun that is relevant to both clauses. The generative
lexicon will serve the purpose (Pustejovsky, 1995).
At present, however, we have not yet fully imple-
mented the lexicon for nouns. Therefore, we give
the Circumstance relation as a default.

5 Experiment and Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999717617647059">
An experiment of recognizing coherence relations of
te-linkage were done for 280 sentences which were
randomly extracted from EDR Corpus (EDR, 1995).
The analysis results are shown in Table 4, where the
coherence relations in the sentences were classified
into 7 categories by authors and compared with the
outputs of the program.
The relations are not balanced in number. This
seems to be due to the genre of texts from which the
test sentences were picked up (most of them were
news articles). The numbers in parentheses show
those of test sentences that matched with the fixed
expressions in Table 1.
The precision on the whole is 82%. This shows
that to a large extent we can cope with the problem
to recognize the coherence relations between clauses
(at least when linked by te), given the event types of
the clauses and the fixed expressions in the lexicon.
Most of errors are caused by ambiguity of the rela-
tion. There were many examples which were difficult
even for humans to make clear judgements. This re-
flects the fact that the coherence relations do not
have definite borders.
However, there were some errors which show a
crucial limitation of our method. This appears as the
bad marks in both precision and recall for the Con-
cession relation, even though the number is small.
For example, there is a test sentence such as follows:
(19) ano hito-wa 82sai-ni natte, annani koukisin
ippai-da.
that person-TOP 82-years-old-DAT become- te,
so curiosity be-full-PRES
&amp;quot;Although that person is 82 years old, (he/she)
is full of curiosity.&amp;quot;

Since the combination of the event type here is
I(BECOME,BE), our program gave it the Circum-
stance relation as a default. However, we know that
in general the person who is 82 years old is not
so curious, therefore the Concession relation arises.
Thus, our common sense knowledge is crucial to our
recognition of the coherence relations. In (Hovy and
Maier, 1993), they classified the Concession rela-
tion as interpersonal (i.e., author-and/or addressee-
related) rather than ideational (i.e., semantic), since
they defined it as &amp;quot;one of the text segments raises
expectations which are contradicted/violated by the
other.&amp;quot; The use of interpersonal relations is predi-
cated mainly on the interests, beliefs, and attitudes
of addressee and/or author. To deal with this prob-
lem, we must incorporate the notion of intentional
structure and focus space structure (Grosz and Sid-
ner, 1986).
Since we have focused on te-linkage in this paper,
we need not to consider how clauses are combined.
However, to detect the discourse structure, we need
to extend the method so as to deal with the relations
between sentences. We must estimate some kind of
reliable scores among possible segments and choose
the relation having the maximum score (Kurohashi
and Nagao, 1994). These issues remain to be studied
in the future.

6 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957695652174">
Since the semantic relations exhibited by te-linkage
vary so diversely, it has been claimed that the inter-
preter must infer the intended relationship on the
basis of extralinguistic knowledge. The particulars
of individual common sense knowledge are crucial
to understanding any discourse (Hobbs et al., 1993;
Asher and Lascarides, 1995). Nevertheless, one can,
through the use of the relevant structures of events,
eliminate a very large number of rules for calculating
the plausible relations.
Although we have concentrated on te-linkage in
this paper, we consider that the method can be
applied to pure parataxis with necessary modifica-
tions. For the relations we have examined are not
attributable to the meaning of te itself (though it re-
stricts the range of them), but are implicated by the
linked conjuncts. The same is true of English and.
In both and- and te-linkage, the perceived coherence
relations are present even if the linked constitutes
are in pure parataxis without and or te. Thus, this
approach can be extended so as to detect the whole
discourse structure, though further study must be
done to examine all relations.

Our linguistic and pragmatic competence enables us to read in conceivable relations even when two clauses are copresent without any overt cues, i.e., in parataxis. There has been a variety of definitions for coherence relations (see (Hovy and Maier, 1993) for a survey). However, the definitions are rather vague and they are often recognized to be underspecified (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994). This paper attempts to explicate how such coherence relations arise between segments of discourse. We focus on te-linkage in Japanese — a translational equivalent of English and-linkage, since mere parataxis ranges over too widely to capture the underlying principles on the coherence relations. We consider that coherence relations are categories each of which has its prototypical instances and marginal ones. As with all instances of categorizations, the prototypical cases of each relation are clearly distinguishable from one another. In some cases, however, it is often hard to make clear arg</context>

Thus, the Circumstance relation composes this category. The cases where the first clause denotes some manner of event are also contained in this category, since a manner accompanies an event. The notion of the manner is continuous to the means since the means and manner of an event are often coextensive in that the means of an event often determines the manner of the event. This is exemplified by English with as well as Japanese de, which are used both as an instrumental or means marker and as a marker of manner (How is similarly polysemous) (Goldberg, 1996). The Means-End relation is also continuous to causation, since the means can be interpreted as a kind of causation. This is exemplified by Japanese doosite (why/how) as follows: (18) doo-site kitano? &amp;quot;Why/How did you come?&amp;quot; Answer: (18a) densya-de (means) &amp;quot;by train&amp;quot; (18b) aitakatta-kara (reason) 991 &amp;quot;since (I) want to meet (you)&amp;quot; (18b) expresses the reason why the speaker came to the hearer — &amp;quot;the wish to meet the hearer caused him/her to come.&amp;quot; Thus, this relation associates the two extremes i.e., parallelism and sequentiality. Finally, the Concession is closely related to both Cause and Con</context>

To deal with this problem, we must incorporate the notion of intentional structure and focus space structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). Since we have focused on te-linkage in this paper, we need not to consider how clauses are combined. However, to detect the discourse structure, we need to extend the method so as to deal with the relations between sentences. We must estimate some kind of reliable scores among possible segments and choose the relation having the maximum score (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). These issues remain to be studied in the future. 6 Summary Since the semantic relations exhibited by te-linkage vary so diversely, it has been claimed that the interpreter must infer the intended relationship on the basis of extralinguistic knowledge. The particulars of individual common sense knowledge are crucial to understanding any discourse (Hobbs et al., 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 1995). Nevertheless, one can, through the use of the relevant structures of events, eliminate a very large number of rules for calculating the plausible relations.

Our linguistic and pragmatic competence enables us to read in conceivable relations even when two clauses are copresent without any overt cues, i.e., in parataxis. There has been a variety of definitions for coherence relations (see (Hovy and Maier, 1993) for a survey). However, the definitions are rather vague and they are often recognized to be underspecified (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994). This paper attempts to explicate how such coherence relations arise between segments of discourse. We focus on te-linkage in Japanese — a translational equivalent of English and-linkage, since mere parataxis ranges over too widely to capture the underlying principles on the coherence relations. We consider that coherence relations are categories each of which has its prototypical instances and marginal ones. As with all instances of categorizations, the prototypical cases of each relation are clearly distinguishable from one another. In some cases, however, it is </context>

These fixed expressions should be listed as a unit in the lexicon. When these expressions appear in the test sentences, we can identify the relation regardless of the procedure described below. Otherwise, we have recourse to the aforementioned properties. 4.3 The Prototypes and the Extensions In the previous study, We have classified verbs into 30 semantic categories, and for each category we have given a lexical conceptual structure (LOS) representation (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997). Since the LCS representation involves lexical decomposition (Jackendoff, 1990), we can utilize the verb internal semantic structure so as to calculate coherence relations in a farely principled way. As mentioned in the introduction, we consider each relation as a category. Categories cannot be defined in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, but rather each instance is categorized according to its similarity to the prototypes of the categories (Rosch, 1973; Lakoff, 1987; Taylor, 1989).

Another extension covers situations where &amp;quot;someone does something, and then he/she does something else.&amp;quot; This is based on the fact that one person cannot generally engage in two actions at the same time. Of course, any type of events may occur sequentially. However, there exists the constraint on the fitness with te-linkage as mentioned in the previous section. The explanation for the other relations is detailed in (Oishi, 1998). As a result of the extensions, many boxes have two or more relations. Notice that the nearer relations in the organization tend to be in the same boxes. To discriminate among them, we specify for each combination of event types such algorithm as follows (below, /(i,j) means that two clauses share an subject and D(i,j) means that two clauses have distinct subjects, where i is the event type of the first clause and j the second): • I(ACT,ACT), I(ACT,G0) If either clause contains the expressions which fix the temporal boundary, then Temporal Sequence; else if the verb of the first clause involv</context>

On the other hand, there remain some boxes blank. They should be resolved by using the third property — the canonical events associated with the noun that is relevant to both clauses. The generative lexicon will serve the purpose (Pustejovsky, 1995). At present, however, we have not yet fully implemented the lexicon for nouns. Therefore, we give the Circumstance relation as a default. 5 Experiment and Discussion An experiment of recognizing coherence relations of te-linkage were done for 280 sentences which were randomly extracted from EDR Corpus (EDR, 1995). The analysis results are shown in Table 4, where the coherence relations in the sentences were classified into 7 categories by authors and compared with the outputs of the program. The relations are not balanced in number. This seems to be due to the genre of texts from which the te</context>
