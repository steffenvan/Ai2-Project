<bodyText confidence="0.999944857142857">
In recent years, the development of intelligent tutoring dialogue systems
has become more prevalent, in an attempt to close the performance gap be-
tween human and computer tutors. Tutoring applications differ in many
ways, however, from the types of applications for which spoken dialogue
systems are typically developed. This talk will illustrate some of the op-
portunities and challenges in this area, focusing on issues such as affective
reasoning, discourse and dialogue analysis, and performance evaluation.
