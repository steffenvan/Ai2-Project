<bodyText confidence="0.99992006060606">
An open, extendible multi-dictionary sys-
tem is introduced in the paper. It supports
the translator in accessing adequate entries
of various bi- and monolingual dictionaries
and translation examples from parallel cor-
pora. Simultaneously an unlimited number
of dictionaries can be held open, thus by a
single interrogation step, all the dictionaries
(translations, explanations, synonyms, etc.)
can be surveyed. The implemented system
(called MoBiDic) knows morphological
rules of the dictionaries&apos; languages. Thus,
never the actual (inflected) words, but al-
ways their lemmas — that is, the right dic-
tionary entries — are looked up. MoBiDic
has an open, multimedial architecture, thus
it is suitable for handling not only textual,
but speaking or picture dictionaries, as well.
The same system is also able to find words
and expressions in corpora, dynamically
providing the translators with examples
from their earlier translations or other
translators&apos; works. MoBiDic has been de-
signed for translator workgroups, where the
translators&apos; own glossaries (built also with
the help of the system) may also be dis-
seminated among the members of the
group, with different access rights, if
needed. The system has a TCP/IP-based
client-server implementation for various
platforms and available with a gradually in-
creasing number of dictionaries for numer-
ous language pairs.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891279069767">
&amp;quot;The whole world of translation is opening up, to
new possibilities, and to technological and meth-
odological change&amp;quot; (Kingscott 1993). Some years
after the above claim, we see that software tools
for translators, even the most recent ones, do not
yet guarantee perfect solutions to automatic
translation. More and more systems introduce,
however, new facilities to the translator working
in a computational environment. As Hutchins
says, &amp;quot;the best use must be made of those systems
that are available, and the producers and develop-
ers must be encouraged to improve and introduce
new facilities to meet user needs.&amp;quot; (Hutchins
1996)
It is almost a commonplace that texts — books,
newspapers, letters, official memos, brochures,
any type of publications, reports, etc. — in the
nineties are written, sent, read and translated with
the help of the electronic media. Consequently,
traditional information sources, like paper-based
dictionaries, and lexicons, are no longer as much a
part of the translation environment.
Electronic dictionaries for most developers just
mean, however, to make the well-known paper
dictionary image appear on the computer screen.
It is easy to understand why we say that dictionary
computerization does not mean producing ma-
chine-readable versions of traditional printed dic-
tionaries, but the combination of the existing lexi-
cal resources with up-to-date language technol-
ogy.
On the other hand, there is a question whether
we have to continue in the traditional way of de-
veloping new — and different — lexicons for any
new application/system, starting from scratch
every time and therefore consuming time, money
and manpower, or is it new lexicons.
In what follows, timely to think of the possi-
bility of making the effort to converge, trying to
avoid unnecessary duplications and — where pos-
sible — building on what already exists (Calzolari
1994). Consequently, in the near future we have
to combine the two above needs: making existing

lexical resources computationally accessible and
showing the strategy how to develop we try to ar-
gue for changes in development strategies of
electronic translation dictionaries. Today&apos;s ling-
ware technology can — and must — use dynamic
actions, like morpho-syntactic analysis, lemmati-
zation, spell checking, and so on. On the other
hand, dictionaries can never be full in any sense,
therefore we have to make parallel multi-
dictionary access possible. It means that a single
dictionary look-up should use an unlimited num-
ber of lexical resources that are available for the
translator.

1 The MoBiDic Look-up System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987911764706">
To start with the most natural activity concerning
dictionaries is searching them for a single word.
There is no problem if it can be found among the
headwords of the dictionary, that is, when the in-
put string can match. But sometimes the translator
starts the look-up process by clicking an inflected
word-form of an open document that cannot be
found among the headwords. For the user it is a
boring and time-consuming task to type the lexical
form, that is, the one accepted letter-by-letter by
the dictionary. To make the system able to find
the stem of the input word-form automatically,
MoBiDic uses a lemmatizer that provides the dic-
tionary look-up module with the stem(s) to be
found (Figure 1).
Translators frequently want to find the word as
a part of multi-word expressions or idioms. If the
user does not know whether the actual word is
part of some phrasal compound or idiom, the tra-
ditional paper dictionaries are very difficult to
use. Namely, if the word in question is the so-
called headword of a multi-word expression, it
can be found easily. In case it is not the headword,
one has to know the phrasal compound the word
is a part of, but it is a typical &amp;quot;Catch 22&amp;quot; situation:
if the expression is known why to search the dic-
tionary for it? MoBiDic helps the user to find all
the multi-word expressions containing the actual
word&apos;s stem, independently whether it is a head-
word or not. E.g. not only &apos;lead&apos; but both &apos;dog&apos; and
&apos;life&apos; provide us (among others) with the multi-
word expression &apos;lead a dog&apos;s life&apos; that can be
found under &apos;lead&apos; only in a paper dictionary. In
other words, users of the traditional dictionaries

are supposed to know the expression (what&apos;s
more: the keyword of the expression) to find it in
the lexicon. Search for &apos;lead a dog&apos;s life&apos; through
its components gives the following result in
MoBiDic:

`13i&apos; is somewhat misleading in the name Mo-
BiDic. Bilingual in this sense means that the
source and the target language are not the same
types of object for the program. For MoBiDic,
source language is the language the morphology
of which has to be known, to provide the user
with adequate output. The output is expected to be
in the target language — the characters, the alpha-
betic order, etc. of which has to be known to make
the hits appear on the screen in adequate format.
Of course, the source and target languages can be
the same, e.g. in explanatory or etymological dic-
tionaries (Figure 2).

There is an another sort of monolingual dic-
tionary, the synonym dictionary. The translator
frequently wants to use a synonym (antonym, hy-
pernym, hyponym) of the actual word. An intelli-
gent software tool, like MorphoLogic&apos;s Helyettel,
is the combination of a thesaurus (synonym dic-
tionary), a morphological analyzer and a genera-
tor, because the output is re-inflected according to
the morphological information contained by the
input word-form. The — so-called inflectional —
thesaurus works as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.840944333333333">
INPUT: came
ANALYSIS: came = come + Past
STEM: come
SYNONYM: go
SYNTHESIS: go + Past = went
OUTPUT: went
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999468863636363">
There are special sorts of information in a dic-
tionary. For example, pronunciation is not typi-
cally needed for translation, but can be useful for
language learners. Pronunciation of the word is,
therefore, an information that should be switched
on and off, according to the user&apos;s needs. In an
electronic dictionary it is expected that not only
the written phonetic transcription, but also the
spoken output can be heard. If the dictionary sup-
ports multimedia, explanatory pictures can help
understand the word, even for professionals, not
for language learners only (Fig. 3).
If the translator makes a spelling error, first a
speller starts, and then the corrected word-form is
sent to the dictionary look-up system.
Examples do belong to the entries of large,
professional paper dictionaries. In electronic dic-
tionaries occurrences of the word in texts of other
authors, or wants to see bilingual texts with their
aligned translations: monolingual or aligned bilin-
gual corpus, a free text search module and a lem-
matizer.

2 Dictionaries in MoBiDic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999242487179487">
The lexicographic basis for MoBiDic is sup-
plied by various publishing houses. More pre-
cisely, MorphoLogic has licenses to almost 50
dictionaries already published in paper format of
miscellaneous topics, diverse sizes and many lan-
guage pairs. The user can choose which dictionary
to use in general, and which of them open actu-
ally. Currently, if all the available dictionaries are
open, MoBiDic handles approximately 1 million
lexical entries.
Some of the dictionaries, mainly the termino-
logical ones, have usually a very simple list-based
structure. Dictionaries shown by Figure 1 and
Figure 2, however, appear on the screen with the
traditional paper dictionary image. It is done by
using SGML representations and an on-line
SGML—RTF conversion. MoBiDic can do exact
structural search not influenced by the layout at
all.
Generally, the original lexical resource — even
it has been available in electronic format — did not
use SGML. For this reason, a special system for a
semi-automatic conversion of some formatted text
files containing dictionary data to SGML format
has been developed for the MoBiDic environ-
ment. This system is not available for the end-
users, it serves industrial purposes.2 First, in order
to enable selective access to the information in
dictionary entries, a thorough structural analysis is
done, while inconsistent and faulty entries are
marked. They are corrected later, manually. The
resulting SGML-annotated dictionaries are en-
hanced with the necessary indexes. They are
lemma-variants and expanded sub-entries made
with the help of existing language technology
modules (Proszeky 1994).
Users like to work with their own little vo-
cabularies, glossaries, and the professional trans-
lator is usually asked to use official translation

equivalents provided by the employer. These
glossaries are generally never published, but there
is a need to us them in the same environment.
MoBiDic is able to treat user dictionaries con-
taining any type of information sources (lexicons,
encyclopedias and dictionaries).
Figure 3
&apos;grapes&apos; (from the PicDIC picture dictionary)

The strength of this method is that user dic-
tionaries are looked up for a word exactly when
other dictionaries, thus translator&apos;s remarks can
also be read when other dictionaries provide the
user with their translation equivalents. Here we
have to emphasize again that MoBiDic is not yet
another electronic dictionary, but a multi-
dictionary environment where a single word is
sent to every open dictionary by a single mouse-
click. In Figure 4 the user started from the word-
form &apos;duties&apos;, and eight dictionaries (that are open
and contain English either on the source or the
target side) send translations to the screen.

3 Implementation Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812483870968">
The most recent development is MoBiDic&apos;s cli-
ent—server implementation. Its server side (Win-
dows NT, Unix and Novell) consists, in fact, of
two servers: the linguistic server and the diction-
ary server. The user interface and screen handling
modules will take place on the (Win, Mac, Linux,
Java, etc.) client side.
There are many software modules of other ven-
dors on the market that can also be combined with
MoBiDic through its well-defined application
programming interface (API). With the help of
this API the user can communicate to the other
modules from MoBiDic without leaving it. Be-
cause of technical and legal reasons, it can, of
course, be done in collaboration with the devel-
oper of the product in question. The picture dic-
tionary shown by Figure 4 is a working example:
the vocabulary part of the (also commercial)
CALL program called PicDIC is available for
MoBiDic users from the familiar environment.
Translators who generally use their favorite
word-processor while translating can use Mo-
BiDic from their word-processing tools with the
help of the included macros. Another important
issue is that users can use their CD-ROM drive for
other purposes while translating. Namely, Mo-
BiDic has minimal space requirement because of
its compression method3, therefore the full dic-
tionary system can be copied to the hard disk: thus
the CD drive is freed and can be used for other
purposes.

There are several dictionary programs both in
laboratories and on the market, but only some of
them share the so-called &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; features
with MoBiDic. Rank Xerox developed in the
COMPASS and Locolex projects a prototype that
accesses enhanced and structurally elaborated
dictionaries with an intelligent, context-sensitive

look-up procedure, presenting the information to
the user through an attractive graphical interface.
(Feldweg and Breidt 1996) Unlike MoBiDic, it
does not have access to more than one dictionary
at the same time. Consequently, user dictionaries
are not supported. SGML is, however, used both
in the dictionary and the corpus modules. There is
a focus on the intelligent treatment of multi-word
units in the IDAREX formalism (Breidt et al
1996). Another project with similar aims is
GLOSSER. Its prototype (Nerbonne et al. 1997)
carries out a morphological analysis of the sen-
tence in which the selected word occurs and a sto-
chastic disambiguation of the word class informa-
tion. This information is then matched against a
(single, but SGML) dictionary and corpora. The
GLOSSER prototype displays context dependent
translations and on request, examples from the
available corpora. Neither of the above develop-
ments nor other web dictionary services (e.g.
WordBot) share all the important features with
MoBiDic: client—server architecture, multi-
dictionary access, user dictionary handling, par-
allel (and intelligent) dictionary and corpus look-
up. What&apos;s more, MoBiDic is commercially also
available, that is tested by thousands of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;
end-users.

MoBiDic is a multi-dictionary translation envi-

On the other hand, dictionaries can never be full in any sense, therefore we have to make parallel multidictionary access possible. It means that a single dictionary look-up should use </context>

Consequently, traditional information sources, like paper-based dictionaries, and lexicons, are no longer as much a part of the translation environment. Electronic dictionaries for most developers just mean, however, to make the well-known paper dictionary image appear on the computer screen.

MoBiDic has been designed for translator workgroups, where the translators&apos; own glossaries (built also with the help of the system) may also be disseminated among the members of the group, with different access rights, if needed. The system has a TCP/IP-based client-server implementation for various platforms and available with a gradually increasing number of dictionaries for numerous language pairs.

This system is not available for the endusers, it serves industrial purposes.2 First, in order to enable selective access to the information in dictionary entries, a thorough structural analysis is done, while inconsistent and faulty entries are marked. They are corrected later, manually. The resulting SGML-annotated dictionaries are enhanced with the necessary indexes. They are lemma-variants and expanded sub-entries made with the help of existing language technology modules (Proszeky 1994).
