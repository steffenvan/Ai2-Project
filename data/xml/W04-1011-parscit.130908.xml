Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999743307692308">
Some document genres contain a large number of
figures. This position paper outlines approaches to
diagram summarization that can augment the many
well-developed techniques of text summarization.
We discuss figures as surrogates for entire docu-
ments, thumbnails, extraction, the relations between
text and figures as well as how automation might be
achieved. The focus is on diagrams (line drawings)
because they allow parsing techniques to be used, in
contrast to the difficulties of general image under-
standing. We describe the advances in raster image
vectorization and parsing needed to produce cor-
pora for diagram summarization.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992140625">
Many documents contain figures, both images and
line drawings (diagrams). The Biology literature,
the focus of our group&apos;s work, is replete with fig-
ures. A surprising 50% of the typical Biology pa-
per is figure-related (see Appendix A). A million
or so Biology papers are published each year, most
with abstracts. But given their high figural con-
tent, work on diagram summarization could also
be quite useful. This is a position paper that ex-
plores this topic, outlining a variety of approaches
to the construction of automated diagram summa-
rization systems. System building and use awaits
the creation of the requisite corpora, as explained
in the next section. This paper builds on our ear-
lier, more lengthy work, extending it in various
ways (Futrelle, 1999).

2 The Current State of the Diagrams
Field
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956710526316">
Automated text summarization has at its disposal,
electronic documents that allow the use of all the
techniques of computational linguistics. Dia-
grams in documents are in a more primitive state.
The overwhelming majority of diagrams avail-
able in the electronic forms of the research litera-
ture today are in raster format. What is needed
are diagrams in vector format in which an object
such as a line is represented not by pixels, but as
a line object defined by its endpoints and width.
We found only 52 pages containing vector-based
diagrams in a collection of 20,000 recent Biology
papers in PDF format (Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, &amp;
Grimes, 2003). Vectorization converts raster dia-
grams to vector format, much as OCR converts
rasters to characters. But the resulting vectorized
diagram is an unordered collection of objects in a
two dimensional space. An additional analysis
step of parsing is required. Our system for pars-
ing diagrams (Futrelle &amp; Nikolakis, 1995) pro-
duces descriptions for a data graph, for example,
by discovering structures such as scale lines and
sets of data points.
There appear to be no non-proprietary vectori-
zation systems that are up to the task of vectoriz-
ing the diagrams from the scientific literature, so
our group is currently focused on developing a
system for this in Java. We are also redeveloping
our parsing system in Java. Until this work is
completed, there will be few diagrams available
for the application of diagram summarization
techniques. This notwithstanding, diagram sum-
marization is an interesting and ultimately impor-
tant task, which is why we are discussing it here.
This work is part of our laboratory&apos;s long-term ef-
fort to characterize the conceptual content of the
Biology literature, including the text and figural
content.

3 Figures as Surrogate Documents
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991704">
Some time ago, when Lesk asked chemists what
two parts of Chemistry papers would be most in-
formative, they said they would like to know the
names of the authors and to see the figures (Mi-
chael Lesk, personal communication).
Recently, journals are beginning to implement
approaches in this spirit. The Journal of Proteome
Research lists in the table of contents, in both the
print and online editions, an entry for each paper
that includes the title, authors, abstract and one
uncaptioned figure from the paper, typically in
color. Science and Nature also include some fig-
ures in their contents pages. The new open-access
journal, PLoS Biology, offers five “Views” of a
paper: HTML, Tables, Figures, Print PDF and
Screen PDF. The Figures View is an HTML slide
show of the figures, each including a large version
of the figure, the caption and the article citation.
Figure Views represent a new and important
type of summary of entire articles, allowing the
rapid browsing that such visual displays provide.
One can imagine that authors will adapt to this new
mode, packing the major content of their papers
into the figures and captions, reducing the need to
read the full text.

4 Thumbnail Images are Summaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.912834714285714">
Thumbnails are images that have been reduced in
size and/or cropped to a smaller size. Shrinking an
entire image so that it acts as a summary is an ana-
log operation that has no parallel in text. For some
images, shrinking them too much can produce an
illegible result, a practice that has been roundly
criticized (item 4 in Nielsen, 2003); cropped im-
ages may be useful in such cases.
An example of cropping two very large images
resulting in informative thumbnails appears in the
Figure Gallery item on our site,
http://diagrams.org/fig–pages/f00022.htm.
The thumbnails are reproduced here in Figures 1
and 2.

5 Extraction for Summarization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999002888888889">
One of the most important techniques used in text
summarization, is extraction, typically the extrac-
tion of carefully chosen whole sentences. A simi-
lar approach can be used for diagram
summarization, but some thought needs to be
given to what the sentence-like elements in dia-
grams might be. It is not difficult to give exam-
ples of diagram extraction, but automating it is
difficult.
is not unusual for a caption to explain only the
methods used to produce the data shown.
The independent contribution of diagram con-
tent to a paper is often signaled by cue phrases.
In referring to data graphs, phrases such as
“shows a significant difference” or “are similar”
or “a pronounced effect” require that the reader
examine the data shown in the figure in order to
understand what the phrases refer to.
Fig. 4 (Nijhout, 2003) appeared in the popular
scientific journal, American Scientist, and is more
carefully explained than most. The Fig. 4 caption
text illustrates some limitations of captions. For
example, the phrase, “The possible combina-
tions” does not spell out what combinations are
possible or are illustrated. The reader must study
the figure to discover that there are in fact three
distinct combinations.

retention of one of the two bar graphs in A, one of the
four rows in B and all of C would result in a modest,
indicative summary of the three-part figure. The keys at
the bottom of part A would have to be retained.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995603571428571">
It might be argued that the most salient content of
documents with figures can be found in the text;
that the figures are redundant, merely “illustra-
tive”. This is often not the case. There are queries
to documents that cannot be answered based on the
content of the text or diagrams considered sepa-
rately (Futrelle &amp; Rumshisky, 2001). In Biology it

Figure 4: The original caption for this figure, with
bolding added, was: &amp;quot; Enzyme activity is a function of
allele identity. In this example, the allele A encodes an
enzyme that has three times greater activity than the
enzyme encoded by allele a. The possible combina-
tions of A and a in an individual yield a wide range of
overall activity levels.&amp;quot;
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916769230769">
The references to A and a in Fig. 4, are deictic
references, pointing to objects visible in the con-
text, in the figure. In ordinary conversation, such
a reference would point to some physical object
in the view of the listener.
A summarization of Figure 4 should include
the entire diagram. The last sentence of the cap-
tion would be a suitable summary of the caption.
The non-caption text and the text within fig-
ures play important roles and need to be taken
into account in any attempt to produce a sum-
mary. Space precludes further discussion of
these.

7 Prospects for Automation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937791666667">
Some degree of summarization might be possible
based entirely on the classes of the diagrams or
subdiagrams in a paper. We have been able to lo-
cate subdiagrams in vector-based diagrams in
PDFs and successfully classify them using Support
Vector Machines (Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, &amp;
Grimes, 2003).
But any more detailed summarization decisions
would require parsed representations of the dia-
grams. For example, our parser can discover and
analyze the two bar charts in Fig. 3, allowing a
system to extract only one of them, though without
any knowledge as to which is the most salient.
The parser can also locate keys, such as the ones in
Fig. 3, so they can be extracted also. Standard
strategies from text summarization, such as ex-
tracting the diagrams most often referred to, dia-
grams appearing near the beginning and end of a
paper, etc., are all possible. Clearly, automation of
diagram summarization presents a new set of chal-
lenges and is no easier than text summarization.
Large scale evaluation of diagram summariza-
tion will offer its own challenges, cf. text summa-
rization evaluation (Radev et al., 2003).

<bodyText confidence="0.999832290322581">
Automated text summarization has advanced sub-
stantially in the last decade. See for example, the
major collection of papers, (Mani &amp; Maybury,
1999) and the special journal issue (Radev, Hovy,
&amp; McKeown, 2002). Reviews include (Hovy,
2002; Marcu, 2003). A recent useful monograph is
(Mani, 2001). Another recent work is (Barzilay,
2003), focused on multidocument summarization
and going beyond sentence extraction to consider
phrases.
Paradoxically, work on the summarization of
scientific articles is inhibited by the fact that virtu-
ally all scientific articles have abstracts as a stan-
dard component. But there are other tasks such as
developing user-tailored summaries (Teufel &amp;
Moens, 2002).
The generation of coordinated explanations in-
volving text and graphics offers insight into the
relations between them (Feiner &amp; McKeown,
1990). This task involves dealing with the internal
structure of diagrams, as do problems of image
retrieval, which can be aided by developing ontol-
ogy-based descriptions of the images (Hyvönen,
Styrman, &amp; Saarela, 2002).
Diagrams form a part of a coordinated dis-
course, so that diagram summarization can profit
from the work done on text summarization that
focuses on discourse structure. Examples of dis-
course-related approaches include (Boguraev &amp;
Neff, 2000; Marcu, 1997a, 1997b; Teufel &amp;
Moens, 2002).

We arrived at the 50% figure by sampling a vari-
ety of recent papers in journals including Science,
Nature, PNAS (USA). The column-inches occu-
pied by figures in the hardcopy or equivalent
PDF versions of the papers were measured and
compared to the total column-inches, omitting the
title, abstract and references. Word counts of the
captions and direct running text reference sen-
tences were estimated, e.g., “Fig. 3 shows ...”.
Then estimates were made of the sentences that
indirectly discussed the figures, often the sen-
tences immediately following direct reference
sentences and containing anaphoric and definite
noun phrase references to the figures, often in
deictic form. The total of the figure and figure
reference content consistently amounted to about
50% of the papers sampled.

Fig. 3: from an issue of Science, is typical of diagrams that appear in the Biology research literature. The extraction suggested in our caption picks one item from each of two sets of similar items to produce and indicative summary. 6 Diagram-Related Text It might be argued that the most salient content of documents with figures can be found in the text; that the figures are redundant, merely “illustrative”. This is often not the case. There are queries to documents that cannot be answered based on the content of the text or diagrams considered separately (Futrelle &amp; Rumshisky, 2001). In Biology it Figure 4: The original caption for this figure, with bolding added, was: &amp;quot; Enzyme activity is a function of allele identity. In this example, the allele A encodes an enzyme that has three times greater activity than the enzyme encoded by allele a. The possible combinations of A and a in an individual yield a wide range of overall activity levels.&amp;quot; The references to A and a in Fig. 4, are deictic references, pointing to objects visible in the context, in the figure. In ordinary conversation, such a reference would point to some physical object in the view of the listener. A summ</context>

Diagrams in documents are in a more primitive state. The overwhelming majority of diagrams available in the electronic forms of the research literature today are in raster format. What is needed are diagrams in vector format in which an object such as a line is represented not by pixels, but as a line object defined by its endpoints and width. We found only 52 pages containing vector-based diagrams in a collection of 20,000 recent Biology papers in PDF format (Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, &amp; Grimes, 2003). Vectorization converts raster diagrams to vector format, much as OCR converts rasters to characters. But the resulting vectorized diagram is an unordered collection of objects in a two dimensional space. An additional analysis step of parsing is required. Our system for parsing diagrams (Futrelle &amp; Nikolakis, 1995) produces descriptions for a data graph, for example, by discovering structures such as scale lines and sets of data points. There appear to be no non-proprietary vectorization systems that are up to the task of vectorizing the diagrams from the scientific literature, so our group</context>
<context position="9070" citStr="Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, &amp; Grimes, 2003" startWordPosition="1498" endWordPosition="1503">ization of Figure 4 should include the entire diagram. The last sentence of the caption would be a suitable summary of the caption. The non-caption text and the text within figures play important roles and need to be taken into account in any attempt to produce a summary. Space precludes further discussion of these. 7 Prospects for Automation Some degree of summarization might be possible based entirely on the classes of the diagrams or subdiagrams in a paper. We have been able to locate subdiagrams in vector-based diagrams in PDFs and successfully classify them using Support Vector Machines (Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, &amp; Grimes, 2003). But any more detailed summarization decisions would require parsed representations of the diagrams. For example, our parser can discover and analyze the two bar charts in Fig. 3, allowing a system to extract only one of them, though without any knowledge as to which is the most salient. The parser can also locate keys, such as the ones in Fig. 3, so they can be extracted also. Standard strategies from text summarization, such as extracting the diagrams most often referred to, diagrams appearing near the beginning and end of a paper, etc., are all possible. Clearly, automation of diagram sum</context>

Paradoxically, work on the summarization of scientific articles is inhibited by the fact that virtually all scientific articles have abstracts as a standard component. But there are other tasks such as developing user-tailored summaries (Teufel &amp; Moens, 2002). The generation of coordinated explanations involving text and graphics offers insight into the relations between them (Feiner &amp; McKeown, 1990). This task involves dealing with the internal structure of diagrams, as do problems of image retrieval, which can be aided by developing ontology-based descriptions of the images (Hyvönen, Styrman, &amp; Saarela, 2002). Diagrams form a part of a coordinated discourse, so that diagram summarization can profit from the work done on text summarization that focuses on discourse structure. Examples of discourse-related approaches include (Boguraev &amp; Neff, 2000; Marcu, 1997a, 1997b; Teufel &amp; Moens, 2002). 9 Conclusions Document summarization including diagrams seems both possible and desirable. Work in this area is waiting on the development of a corpus of parsed object-based diagrams. The vectorization and parsing systems required are under development. 10 Acknowledgements This material is based upon work suppo</context>

One can imagine that authors will adapt to this new mode, packing the major content of their papers into the figures and captions, reducing the need to read the full text. 4 Thumbnail Images are Summaries Thumbnails are images that have been reduced in size and/or cropped to a smaller size. Shrinking an entire image so that it acts as a summary is an analog operation that has no parallel in text. For some images, shrinking them too much can produce an illegible result, a practice that has been roundly criticized (item 4 in Nielsen, 2003); cropped images may be useful in such cases. An example of cropping two very large images resulting in informative thumbnails appears in the Figure Gallery item on our site, http://diagrams.org/fig–pages/f00022.htm.

It is not difficult to give examples of diagram extraction, but automating it is difficult. is not unusual for a caption to explain only the methods used to produce the data shown. The independent contribution of diagram content to a paper is often signaled by cue phrases. In referring to data graphs, phrases such as “shows a significant difference” or “are similar” or “a pronounced effect” require that the reader examine the data shown in the figure in order to understand what the phrases refer to. Fig. 4 (Nijhout, 2003) appeared in the popular scientific journal, American Scientist, and is more carefully explained than most. The Fig. 4 caption text illustrates some limitations of captions. For example, the phrase, “The possible combinations” does not spell out what combinations are possible or are illustrated. The reader must study the figure to discover that there are in fact three distinct combinations. Figure 3: A typical diagram that allows summarization by extraction. From (Holtzendorff, 2004).
