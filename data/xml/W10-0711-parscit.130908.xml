<bodyText confidence="0.999602428571429">
This paper describes a semi-automatic para-
phrasing task for English-Arabic machine
translation conducted using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk. The method for automatically
extracting paraphrases is described, as are
several human judgment tasks completed by
Turkers. An ideal task type, revised specif-
ically to address feedback from Turkers, is
shown to be sophisticated enough to identify
and filter problem Turkers while remaining
simple enough for non-experts to complete.
The results of this task are discussed along
with the viability of using this data to combat
data sparsity in MT.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966212121212">
Many language pairs have large amounts of paral-
lel text that can be used to build statistical machine
translation (MT) systems. For such language pairs,
resources for system tuning and evaluation tend to
be disproportionately abundant in the language typ-
ically used as the target. For example, the NIST
Open Machine Translation Evaluation (OpenMT)
2009 (Garofolo, 2009) constrained Arabic-English
development and evaluation data includes four En-
glish translations for each Arabic source sentence,
as English is the usual target language. However,
when considering this data to tune and evaluate
an English-to-Arabic system, each English sentence
has a single Arabic translation and such translations
are often identical. With at most one reference trans-
lation for each source sentence, standard minimum
error rate training (Och, 2003) to the BLEU met-
ric (Papineni et al., 2002) becomes problematic, as
BLEU relies on the availability of multiple refer-
ences.
We describe a semi-automatic paraphrasing
technique that addresses this problem by identifying
paraphrases that can be used to create new reference
translations based on valid phrase substitutions on
existing references. Paraphrases are automatically
extracted from a large parallel corpus and filtered by
quality judgments collected from human annotators
using Amazon Mechanical Turk. As Turkers are
not trained to complete natural language processing
(NLP) tasks and can dishonestly submit random
judgments, we develop a task type that is able to
catch problem Turkers while remaining simple
enough for untrained annotators to understand.

The parallel corpus used for paraphrasing con-
sists of all Arabic-English sentence pairs in the
NIST OpenMT Evaluation 2009 (Garofolo, 2009)
constrained training data. The target corpus to be
paraphrased consists of the 728 Arabic sentences
from the OpenMT 2002 (Garofolo, 2002) develop-
ment data.

ing Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005), we iden-
tify Arabic phrases (a1) in the target corpus that are
translated by at least one English phrase (e). We
identify paraphrase candidates as alternate Arabic
phrases (a2) that translate e. The probability of a2
being a paraphrase of a1 given foreign phrases e is
defined:

<bodyText confidence="0.999972153846154">
A language model trained on the Arabic side of the
parallel corpus is used to further score the possi-
ble paraphrases. As each original phrase (a1) oc-
curs in some sentence (s1) in the target corpus, a
paraphrased sentence (s2) can be created by replac-
ing a1 with one of its paraphrases (a2). The final
paraphrase score considers context, scaling the para-
phrase probability proportionally to the change in
log-probability of the sentence:
These scores can be combined for each pair (a1, a2)
to obtain overall paraphrase scores, however we
use the F scores directly as our task considers the
sentences in which paraphrases occur.

3 Turker Paraphrase Assessment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981941176471">
To determine which paraphrases to use to trans-
form the development set references, we elicit bi-
nary judgments of quality from human annotators.
While collecting this data from experts would be ex-
pensive and time consuming, Amazon’s Mechani-
cal Turk (MTurk) service facilitates the rapid collec-
tion of large amounts of inexpensive data from users
around the world. As these users are not trained
to work on natural language processing tasks, any
work posted on MTurk must be designed such that
it can be understood and completed successfully by
untrained annotators. Further, some Turkers attempt
to dishonestly profit from entering random answers,
creating a need for tasks to have built-in measures
for identifying and filtering out problem Turkers.
Our original evaluation task consists of eliciting
two yes/no judgments for each paraphrase and cor-
responding sentence. Shown the original phrase
(a1) and the paraphrase (a2), annotators are asked
whether or not these two phrases could have the
same meaning in some possible context. Annotators
are then shown the original sentence (s1) and the
paraphrased sentence (s2) and asked whether these
two sentences have the same meaning. This task has
the attractive property that if s1 and s2 have the same
meaning, a1 and a2 can have the same meaning. An-
notators assigning “yes” to the sentence pair should
always assign “yes” to the phrase pair.
To collect these judgments from MTurk, we de-
sign a human intelligence task (HIT) that presents
Turkers with two instances of the above task along
with a text area for optional feedback. The task
description asks skilled Arabic speakers to evalu-
ate paraphrases of Arabic text. For each HIT, we
pay Turkers $0.01 and Amazon fees of $0.005 for
a total label cost of $0.015. For our initial test,
we ask Turkers to evaluate the 400 highest-scoring
paraphrases, collecting 3 unique judgments for each
paraphrase in and out of context. These HITs were
completed at a rate of 200 per day.
Examining the results, we notice that most
Turkers assign “yes” to the sentence pairs more
often than to the phrase pairs, which should not be
possible. To determine whether quality of Turkers
might be an issue, we run another test for the same
400 paraphrases, this time paying Turkers $0.02 per
HIT and requiring a worker approval rate of 98% to
work on this task. These HITs, completed by high
quality Turkers at a rate of 100 per day, resulted
in similarly impossible data. However, we also
received valuable feedback from one of the Turkers.

3.1 Turker Feedback
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993727272727">
We received a comment from one Turker that
our evaluation task was causing confusion. The
Turker would select “no” for some paraphrase in
isolation due to missing information. However, the
Turker would then select “yes” for the paraphrased
sentence, as the context surrounding the phrase
rendered the missing information unnecessary.
This illustrates the point that untrained annotators
understand the idea of “possible context” differently
from experts and allows us to restructure our HITs
to be ideal for untrained Turkers.

3.2 Revised Main Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988272727273">
We simplify our task to eliminate as many sources
of ambiguity as possible. Our revised task simply
presents annotators with the original sentence la-
beled “sentence 1” and the paraphrased sentence la-
beled “sentence 2”, and asks whether or not the two
sentences have the same meaning. Each HIT, titled
“Evaluate Arabic Sentences”, presents Turkers with
2 such tasks, pays $0.02, and costs $0.005 in Ama-
zon fees.
Without additional consideration, this task re-
mains highly susceptible to random answers from
dishonest or unreliable Turkers. To ensure that such
Turkers are identified and removed, we intersperse
absolute positive and negative examples with the
sentence pairs from our data set. Absolute posi-
tives consist of the same original sentence sl re-
peated twice and should always receive a “yes” judg-
ment. Absolute negatives consist of some origi-
nal sl and a different, randomly selected original
sentence si with several words dropped to obscure
meaning. Absolute negatives should always receive
a “no” judgment. Positive and negative control cases
can be inserted with a frequency based either on de-
sired confidence that enough cases are encountered
for normalization or on the availability of funds.
Inserting either a positive or negative control
case every 5th task increases the per-label cost to
$0.0156. We use this task type to collect 3 unique
judgments for each of the 1280 highest-scoring
paraphrases at a total cost of $60.00 for 2400 HITs.
These HITs were completed substantially faster at a
rate of 500-1000 per day. The results of this task are
discussed in section 4.

3.3 Editing Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998897">
We conduct an additional experiment to see if Turk-
ers will fix paraphrases judged to be incorrect. The
task extends the sentence evaluation task described
in the previous section by asking Turkers who select
“no” to edit the paraphrase text in the second sen-
tence such that the sentences have the same mean-
ing. While the binary judgment task is used for fil-
tering only, this editing task ensures a usable data
point for every HIT completed. As such, fewer total
HITs are required and high quality Turkers can be

paid more for each HIT. We run 3 sequential tests
for this task, offering $0.02, $0.04, and $0.10 per
paraphrase approved or edited.
Examining the results, we found that regardless
of price, very few paraphrases were actually edited,
even when Turkers selected “no” for sentence
equality. While this allows us to easily identify and
remove problem Turkers, it does not solve the issue
that honest Turkers either cannot or will not provide
usable paraphrase edits for this price range. A brief
examination by an expert indicates that the $0.02
per HIT edits are actually better than the $0.10 per
HIT edits.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9647048">
Our main task of 2400 HITs was completed through
the combined effort of 47 unique Turkers. As shown
Figure 1, these Turkers have varying degrees of ac-
curacy classifying the control cases. The two most
common classes of Turkers include (1) those spend-
ing 15 or more seconds per judgment and scoring
above 0.9 accuracy on the control cases and (2) those
spending 5-10 seconds per judgment and scoring be-
tween 0.4 and 0.6 accuracy as would be expected by
chance. As such, we accept but do not consider the
judgments of Turkers scoring between 0.7 and 0.9
accuracy on the control set, and reject all HITs for
Turkers scoring below 0.7, republishing them to be
completed by other workers.

After removing judgments from below-threshold
annotators, all remaining judgments are used to
confirm or reject the covered paraphrases. If a
paraphrase has at least 2 remaining judgments, it is
confirmed if at least 2 annotators judge it positively
and rejected otherwise. Paraphrases with fewer than
2 remaining judgments are considered undecidable.
Table 1 shows the distribution of results for the 1280
top-scoring paraphrases. As shown in the table,
726 paraphrases are confirmed as legitimate phrase
substitutions on reference translations, providing
an average of almost one paraphrase per reference.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999103">
We have presented a semi-automatic paraphrasing
technique for creating additional reference transla-
tions. The paraphrase extraction technique provides
a ranked list of paraphrases and their contexts which
can be incrementally filtered by human judgments.
Our judgment task is designed to address specific
Turker feedback, remaining simple enough for
non-experts while successfully catching problem
users. The $60.00 worth of judgments collected
produces enough paraphrases to apply an average

of one phrase substitution to each reference. Our
future work includes collecting sufficient data to
substitute multiple paraphrases into each Arabic
reference in our development set, producing a full
additional set of reference translations for use tuning
our English-to-Arabic MT system. The resulting
individual paraphrases can also be used for other
tasks in MT and NLP.
