<bodyText confidence="0.999893">
In the first part of the paper, I present a
new treatment of THE IMPERFECTIVE PARADOX
(Dowty 1979) for the restricted case of trajectory-
of-motion events. This treatment extends and re-
fines those of Moens and Steedman (1988) and
Jackendoff (1991). In the second part, I describe
an implemented algorithm based on this treatment
which determines whether a specified sequence of
such events is or is not possible under certain sit-
uationally supplied constraints and restrictive as-
sumptions.

Bach (1986:12) summarizes THE IMPERFECTIVE
PARADOX (Dowty 1979) as follows: &amp;quot;...how can
we characterize the meaning of a progressive sen-
tence like (la) [17] on the basis of the meaning of
a simple sentence like (lb) [18] when (la) can be
true of a history without (lb) ever being true?&amp;quot;
(la) John was crossing the street.
(lb) John crossed the street.
Citing parallels in the nominal domain, Bach goes
on to point out that this puzzle is seemingly much
more general, insofar as it appears whenever any
sort of partitive is employed. In support of this
view, we may observe that the siari v-ing con-
struction exhibits the same behavior:

occurrence of the beginning of such an event, leav-
ing open the existential status of its completion.
Capitalizing on Bach&apos;s insight, I present in
the first part of the paper a new treatment of
the imperfective paradox which relies on the pos-
sibility of having actual events standing in the
part-of relation to hypothetical super-events. This
treatment extends and refines those of Moens
and Steedman (1988) and Jackendoff (1991), at
least for the restricted case of trajectory-of-motion
events.&apos; In particular, the present treatment cor-
rectly accounts not only for what (2a) fails to en-
tail — namely, that John eventually reaches the
museum — but also for what (2a) does in fact en-
tail — namely, that John follows (by jogging) at
least an initial part of a path that leads to the
museum. In the second part of the paper, I briefly
describe an implemented algorithm based on this
theoretical treatment which determines whether a
specified sequence of trajectory-of-motion is or is
not possible under certain situationally supplied
constraints and restrictive assumptions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999923461538462">
The present treatment builds upon the ap-
proach to aspectual composition developed in
White (1993), a brief sketch of which follows.
White (1993) argues that substances, processes
and other such entities should be modeled as ab-
stract kinds whose realizations (things, events,
etc.) vary in amount.2 This is accomplished for-
mally through the use of an order-sorted logic
with an axiomatized collection of binary relations.
The intended sort hierarchy is much like those
of Eberle (1990) and Jackendoff (1991); in par-
ticular, both substances and things are taken to
be subsorts of the material entities, and similarly

1These are elsewhere called &apos;directed-motion&apos;
events.
2This move is intended to resolve certain empirical
and computational problems with the view of refer-
ential homogeneity espoused by Krifka (1992) and his
predecessors.
</footnote>

both processes and events are taken to be sub-
sorts of the non-stative eventualities. What is new
is the axiomatization of Jackendoff&apos;s composed-of
relation (comp) — which effects the aforemen-
tioned kind-to-realization mapping — in terms of
Krifka&apos;s (1992) part-of relation (C). Of particular
interest is the following subpart closure property:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.49088">
(3) Vxyi y2[comp(x)(m) A y2CY1 —+ comp(x)(y2)]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984401428571429">
Postulate (3) states that all subparts of a realiza-
tion of a given kind are also realizations of that
kind.&apos; From this postulate it follows, for example,
that if e is a process of John running along the
river which has a realization el lasting ten min-
utes, and if e2 is a subevent of el — the first half,
say — then e2 is also a realization of e. As such,
this postulate may be used to make John ran along
the river for ten minutes entail John ran along the
river for five minutes, in contrast to the pair John
ran to the museum in ten minutes and John ran
to the museum in five minutes.
In order to resolve the imperfective paradox,
we may extend White (1993) by adding a mapping
from events to processes (whose realizations need
not terminate in the same way), as well as a means
for distinguishing actual and hypothetical events.
To do the former, we may axiomatize comp&apos;s in-
verse mapping — Jackendoff&apos;s ground-from (gr)
— again in terms of Krifka&apos;s part-of relation. This
is shown below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992536">
(4) Vxylyz[gr(m.)(x) A comp(x)(y2) Yz.cYi]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99749175">
Postulate (4) simply requires that all the realiza-
tions e2 of a process e which is &apos;ground from&apos; an
event el must be subevents of el (and likewise,
mutatis mutandis, for substances and things). As
the realizations e2 of e may be proper subevents of
el, the relation gr provides a means for accessing
subevents of el with alternate terminations.
To distinguish those events which actually oc-
cur from those that are merely hypothetical, we
may simply introduce a special predicate Actual,
which we require to preserve the part-of relation
only in the downwards direction:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993434">
(5) Vsy[Actual(x) A yEx —+ Actual(y)]
</listItem>
<construct confidence="0.6293106">
Postulate (5) is necessary to get John stopped run-
ning to the museum after ten minutes to entail
John ran for ten minutes as well as John ran for
nine minutes, but not John ran for eleven min-
utes.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.910163285714286">
At this point we are ready to examine in some
detail how the above machinery may be used in
resolving the imperfective paradox. Let us assume
&apos;For the sake of simplicity I will not address the
minimal parts problem here.
that sentences such as (6) receive compositional
translations as in (7):

Actual(e3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935588235294">
In (7), el is an event of John running to the
bridge.&apos; In (7a), this event is asserted to be actual;
in (7b), in contrast, the progressive morphology on
run triggers the introduction of gr, which maps
el to the process e.5 It is this process which e3 is
an event of stopping: following Jackendoff (1991),
this is represented here by introducing an event ez
composed of e which has e3 as its stopping point.
Naturally enough, we may expect the actuality
of e3 to entail the actuality of e2, and thus all
subevents of e2. Nevertheless, the actuality of el
does not follow, as Postulate (4) permits e2 to be
a proper subpart of el (which is pragmatically the
most likely case).
To make the semantics developed so far more
concrete, we may now impose a particular inter-
pretation on trajectory-of-motion events, namely
one in which these are modeled as continuous func-
tions from times to locations of the object in mo-
tion. Depending on how we model objects and
locations, we of course arrive at interpretations of
varying complexity. In what follows we focus only
on the simplest such interpretation, which takes
both to be points.
Note that by assuming the preceding inter-
pretation of trajectory-of-motion events, we may
interpret the relation C as the relation continuous-
subset. Furthermore, we may also interpret pro-
cesses as sets of events closed under the C rela-
tion; this then permits comp to be interpreted
as element-of, and gr (for events) as mapping an
event to the smallest process containing it. Before
continuing, we may observe that this interpreta-
tion does indeed satisfy Postulates (3) and (4).

avoid having an ill-sorted formula.

the manner of motion supplied by a verb, it does
nevertheless permit one to consider factors such as
the normal speed as well as the meanings of the
prepositions to, towards, etc. By making two ad-
ditional restrictive assumptions, namely that these
events be of constant velocity and in one dimen-
sion, I have been able to construct and implement
an algorithm which determines whether a speci-
fied sequence of such events is or is not possible
under certain situationally supplied constraints.
These constraints include the locations of various
landmarks (assumed to remain stationary) and the
minimum, maximum, and normal rates associated
with various manners of motion (e.g. running, jog-
ging) for a given individual.
The algorithm takes an input string and com-
positionally derives a sequence of logical forms
(one for each sentence) using a simple categorial
grammar (most of which appears in White 1993).
A special-purpose procedure is then used to in-
stantiate the described sequence of events as a con-
straint optimization problem; note that although
this procedure is quite ad-hoc, the constraints are
represented in a declarative, hierarchical fashion
(cf. White 1993). If the constraint optimiza-
tion problem has a solution, it is found using a
slightly modified version of the constraint satis-
faction procedure built into SCREAMER, Siskind
and McAllester&apos;s (1993) portable, efficient version
of nondeterministic Common Lisp.6
As an example of an impossible description,
let us consider the sequence of events described
below:
(8) Guy started jogging eastwards along the river.
25 minutes later he reached {the cafe / the
museum).
If we assume that the user specifies the cafe and
the museum to be 5 and 10 km, respectively, from
the implicit starting point, and that the rates spec-
ified for Guy are those of a serious but not super-
human athlete, then the algorithm will only find
a solution for the first case (10 km in 25 minutes
is too much to expect.) Now, by reasoning about
subevents — here, subsegments of lines in space-
time — the program exhibits the same behavior
with the pair in (9):
(9) Guy started jogging to the bar. 25 minutes
later he reached {the cafe / the museum).
Since *Guy jogging to the cafe is accepted as a
possible proper subevent of Guy jogging to the
&apos;The constraint optimization problem is split into
two constraint satisfaction problems, namely find-
ing the smallest consistent value of a cost variable
and then finding consistent values for the rest of the
variables.
bar (assuming the bar is further east than the
other landmarks), example (9) shows how the
present approach successfully avoids the imperfec-
tive paradox; since Guy jogging to the museum (in
25 minutes) is not accepted as a possible subevent,
example (9) likewise shows how the present ap-
proach extends and refines those of Moens and
Steedman and Jackendoff vis-a-vis the subevent
relation .7

The algorithm as implemented functions only un-
der a number of quite restrictive assumptions, and
suffers from a rather ad-hoc use of the derived logi-
cal forms. In future work I intend to extend the al-
gorithm beyond the unidimensional and constant
velocity cases considered so far, and to investigate
incorporating the present treatment into the In-

Hobbs et. al. (1993).

In the second part of the paper, I briefly describe an implemented algorithm based on this theoretical treatment which determines whether a specified sequence of trajectory-of-motion is or is not possible under certain situationally supplied constraints and restrictive assumptions. Theory The present treatment builds upon the approach to aspectual composition developed in White (1993), a brief sketch of which follows. White (1993) argues that substances, processes and other such entities should be modeled as abstract kinds whose realizations (things, events, etc.) vary in amount.2 This is accomplished formally through the use of an order-sorted logic with an axiomatized collection of binary relations. The intended sort hierarchy is much like those of Eberle (1990) and Jackendoff (1991); in particular, both substances and things are taken to be subsorts of the material entities, and similarly 1These are elsewhere called &apos;directed-motion&apos; events. 2This move is intended to re</context>

As such, this postulate may be used to make John ran along the river for ten minutes entail John ran along the river for five minutes, in contrast to the pair John ran to the museum in ten minutes and John ran to the museum in five minutes. In order to resolve the imperfective paradox, we may extend White (1993) by adding a mapping from events to processes (whose realizations need not terminate in the same way), as well as a means for distinguishing actual and hypothetical events. To do the former, we may axiomatize comp&apos;s inverse mapping — Jackendoff&apos;s ground-from (gr) — again in terms of Krifka&apos;s part-of relation. This is shown below: (4) Vxylyz[gr(m.)(x) A comp(x)(y2) Yz.cYi] Postulate (4) simply requires that all the realizations e2 of a process e which is &apos;ground from&apos; an event el must be subevents of el (and likewise, mutatis mutandis, for substances and things). As the realizations e2 of e may</context>

Furthermore, we may also interpret processes as sets of events closed under the C relation; this then permits comp to be interpreted as element-of, and gr (for events) as mapping an event to the smallest process containing it.

The algorithm takes an input string and compositionally derives a sequence of logical forms (one for each sentence) using a simple categorial grammar (most of which appears in White 1993). A special-purpose procedure is then used to instantiate the described sequence of events as a constraint optimization problem; note that although this procedure is quite ad-hoc, the constraints are represented in a declarative, hierarchical fashion (cf. White 1993). If the constraint optimization problem has a solution, it is found using a slightly modified version of the constraint satisfaction procedure built into SCREAMER, Siskind and McAllester&apos;s (1993) portable, efficient version of nondeterministic Common Lisp.6 As an example of an impossible description, let us consider the sequence of events described below: (8) Guy started jogging eastwards along the river. 25 minutes later he reached {the cafe / the museum). If we assume that the user specifies the cafe and the museum to be 5 and 10 km, respectively, from the implicit starting point, and that </context>
