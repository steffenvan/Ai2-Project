The EU Copernicus project Multext-East has
created a multi-lingual corpus of text and speech
data, covering the six languages of the project:
Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian,
Romanian, and Slovene. In addition, wordform
lexicons for each of the languages were
developed. The corpus includes a parallel
component consisting of Orwell&apos;s Nineteen
Eighty-Four, with versions in all six languages
tagged for part-of-speech and aligned to English
(also tagged for POS). We describe the encoding
format and data architecture designed especially
for this corpus, which is generally usable for
encoding linguistic corpora. We also describe the
methodology for the development of a
harmonized set of morphosyntactic descriptions
(MSDs), which builds upon the scheme for
western European languages developed within
the EAGLES project. We discuss the special
concerns for handling the six project languages,
which cover three distinct language families.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908423076923">
In order to provide resources to enable the
efficient extraction of quantitative and
qualitative information from corpora, several
corpus development and distribution efforts have
been recently established. However, few corpora
exist for Central and Eastern European (CEE)
languages, and corpus-processing tools that take
into account the specific characteristics of these
languages are virtually non-existent.
The Multext-East Copernicus project&apos; (Erjavec,
et at., 1997) was a spin-off of the LRE project
Multext2 (Ide and Veronis, 1994) intended to fill
these gaps by developing significant resources
for six CEE languages (Bulgarian, Czech,
Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene) that
follow a consistent and principled encoding
format and are maximally suited to easy
processing by corpus-handling tools. To this
end, Multext-East developed a corpus of parallel
and comparable texts for the six CEE project
languages, together with wordform lexicons and
other language-specific resources. In the
following sections we briefly describe the
Multext-East corpora (text, speech) and the
Mul text-East lexicons and language-specific
resources.

Corpus Encoding Standard (CES)3 (Ide, 1998),
which has been developed to be optimally suited
for use in language engineering and corpus-
based work. The CES is an application of SGML
(ISO-8879, Standard Generalized Markup
Language) and is based on the TEl Guidelines
for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.
In addition to providing encoding conventions
for elements relevant to corpus-based work, the
CES provides a data architecture for linguistic
corpora and their annotations. Each corpus
component, comprising a single text and its
annotations, is organized as a hyper-document,
with various levels of annotation stored in
separate SGML documents (each with a separate
DTD). Low-density (i.e., above the token level)
annotation is expressed indirectly in terms of
inter-document links. Markup for different types
of annotation (e.g., part of speech, alignment,
etc.) is described by a separate Data Type
Definition (DTD) specifically tailored to that
information.

<bodyText confidence="0.994532678571429">
The Multext-East parallel corpus consists of
seven translations of George Orwell&apos;s Nineteen
Eighty-Four: besides the original English
version, the corpus contains translations in the
six project languages. There are three versions
of each text in the parallel corpus, corresponding
to different levels of annotation: a cesDoc
encoding (SGML markup up to the sub-
paragraph level, including markup for sentence
boundaries); and a cesAna encoding, containing
word-level morphosyntactic markup together
with links to each sentence (and in some
versions, to each word) in the cesDoc version. A
fourth document, the cesAlign document, is
associated with each of the non-English
versions, which includes links between
sentences in the cesDoc encoding for each and
the English version, thus providing a parallel
alignment at the sentence level. The cesAna
versions, which are the most linguistically

<bodyText confidence="0.999973708333333">
The texts from the corpora were segmented
using the corpus annotation toolset developed
within the Multext project, augmented by
language-specific resources developed by
Multext-East. The Multext segmenter is a
language-independent and configurable
tokenizer whose output includes token,
paragraph and sentence boundary markers.
Punctuation, lexical items, numbers, and various
alphanumeric sequences (such as dates and
hours) are annotated with tags defined in a
hierarchical, class-structured tagset. The
language-specific behavior of the segmenter is
enabled by its engine-driven design, in which all
language-specific information is provided as
data. Within Multext-East, resource data,
including rules describing the form of sentence
boundaries, word splitting (cliticized forms
decomposition), word compounding, quotations,
numbers, dates, punctuation, capitalization,
abbreviations etc., was developed for the six
project languages.
Once the input text was tokenized, a dictionary
look-up procedure was used to assign each
lexical token all its possible morphosyntactic
descriptors (MSDs). The ambiguously MSD-
annotated texts were then hand-disambiguated
(entirely for some languages and partially for the
others). This time-consuming and error-prone
process was sped up significantly by a special
XEMACS mode, developed within the project,
which is aware of the morphosyntactic
descriptors&apos; significance and allows for natural
language expansion of the linear encoding of the
MSDs. The ambiguously MSD-annotated texts
and the corresponding disambiguated texts
provided the basis for building the cesAna
encoded version of the multilingual parallel
corpus.
The corpus also contains six language pair-wise
alignments between each of the six project
languages and English. The alignments were
performed by three different automatic aligners
(Multext-aligner, &amp;quot;vanilla-aligner&amp;quot;, Silfide-
aligner) with accuracy ranging between 75-90%,
and then hand validated. Table 2 shows the
distribution of sentence alignments for each pair
of languages.

Multext-East also produced a multilingual
comparable corpus, including two subsets of at
least 100,000 words each for each of the six
project languages. The texts include fiction,
comprising a single novel or excerpts from
several novels, and newspaper data.
The data is comparable across the six languages,
in terms of the number and size of texts. The
entire multilingual comparable corpus was
prepared in CES format manually or using ad

Multext-East, in collaboration with EAGLES,
evaluated, adapted and extended the EAGLES
morphosyntactic specifications (rule format,
lexical specifications, anus tape, etc.) to
cover the six Multext-East languages (Erjavec
and Monachini, 1997). Accommodating the
different language families represented among
the Multext-East languages demanded
substantial assessment and modification of the
pre-existing specifications, which were
originally developed for western European
languages only.
For corpus morpho-lexical processing purposes,
the Multext-East consortium developed
language-specific wordform dictionaries, which,
for all languages except Estonian and
Hungarian, contain the full inflectional paradigm
for at least the lemmas appearing in the corpus.
Each dictionary entry has the following
structure:
wordform [TAB] lemma [TAB] MSD [TAB]
where wordform represents an inflected form of
the lemma, characterised by a combination of
feature values encoded by a Morphosyntactic
Description (MSD). The Multext-East lexicons
and MSDs are fully described in Tufis, 1de, and
Erjavec (1998).
A general overview of the lexicons is shown in
Table 3. The Entries column provides the
number of dictionary entries, that is, triplets:
&lt;wordform lemma MSD&gt;. The Wordforms
column gives the number of distinct wordforms
appearing in the lexicon, irrespective of their
lemma and MSD. The Lemma column gives the
number of distinct lemmas in the lexicon,
eliminating duplications that appear due to
lemma homography. The difference between the
Lemma and &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; fields provides an estimate of
the number of homographic lemmas. The MSD
field gives the total number of distinct MSDs
used in the encoding of the lexicon stock.
The last two columns in Table 3 (AMB_POS
and AMB_MSD) provide information about the
number of ambiguity classification clusters. An
ambiguity classification cluster provides the
number of ways a homographic wordform can
be classified. AMB_POS (&amp;quot;part of speech
ambiguity&amp;quot;) and AMB MSD (&amp;quot;MSD-
ambiguity&amp;quot;) provide the classification based on
the part of speech and MSD, respectively. The
number of ambiguity classes (based either on
POS or MSD) is a key figure in estimating the
space needed to construct a statistical language

model (such as HMM) useful for
morphosyntactic disambiguation. This number
was a key factor in the tagset design.
For several of the project languages and for
English, a set of corpus tags has also been
developed which are appropriate for use with
stochastic disambiguators. Where corpus tags
have been developed, mapping rules from MSDs
to corpus tags (n-to-1 mapping) are also
provided as a resource.

The multilingual resources (lexicons, rules,
corpora) developed in Multext-East are among
of the most comprehensive resources currently
available for most of the project languages. In
addition to resource development, the work
carried out in Multext-East has contributed
significantly to defining general mechanisms for
lexical specification, and it has provided a test of
the extensibility of standards and tools beyond
the languages for which they were originally
developed. All Multext-East resources and tools
are distributed, at cost, on CD ROM through the
TELRI project5 (see Erjavec, Lawson, and

<abstract confidence="0.975797636363636">The EU Copernicus project Multext-East has created a multi-lingual corpus of text and speech data, covering the six languages of the project: Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Slovene. In addition, wordform lexicons for each of the languages were developed. The corpus includes a parallel consisting of Orwell&apos;s versions in all six languages tagged for part-of-speech and aligned to English (also tagged for POS). We describe the encoding format and data architecture designed especially for this corpus, which is generally usable for encoding linguistic corpora. We also describe the methodology for the development of a harmonized set of morphosyntactic descriptions (MSDs), which builds upon the scheme for western European languages developed within the EAGLES project. We discuss the special concerns for handling the six project languages, which cover three distinct language families.</abstract>

Accommodating the different language families represented among the Multext-East languages demanded substantial assessment and modification of the pre-existing specifications, which were originally developed for western European languages only. For corpus morpho-lexical processing purposes, the Multext-East consortium developed language-specific wordform dictionaries, which, for all languages except Estonian and Hungarian, contain the full inflectional paradigm for at least the lemmas appearing in the corpus. Each dictionary entry has the following structure: wordform [TAB] lemma [TAB] MSD [</context>

The CES is an application of SGML (ISO-8879, Standard Generalized Markup Language) and is based on the TEl Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange. In addition to providing encoding conventions for elements relevant to corpus-based work, the CES provides a data architecture for linguistic corpora and their annotations. Each corpus component, comprising a single text and its annotations, is organized as a hyper-document, with various levels of annotation stored in separate SGM</context>

Introduction In order to provide resources to enable the efficient extraction of quantitative and qualitative information from corpora, several corpus development and distribution efforts have been recently established. However, few corpora exist for Central and Eastern European (CEE) languages, and corpus-processing tools that take into account the specific characteristics of these languages are virtually non-existent. The Multext-East Copernicus project&apos; (Erjavec, et at., 1997) was a spin-off of the LRE project Multext2 (Ide and Veronis, 1994) intended to fill these gaps by developing significant resources for six CEE languages (Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene) that follow a consistent and principled encoding format and are maximally suited to easy processing by corpus-handling tools. To this end, Multext-East developed a corpus of parallel and comparable texts for the six CEE project languages, together with wordform lexicons and other language-specific resources. In the following sections we briefly describe the Multext-East corpora (text, speech) and the Mul text-East lexicons and language-specific resou</context>
