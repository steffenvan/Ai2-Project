This paper attempts to use an off-the-shelf
anaphora resolution (AR) system for Bengali.
The language specific preprocessing modules
of GuiTAR (v3.0.3) are identified and suitably
designed for Bengali. Anaphora resolution
module is also modified or replaced in order to
realize different configurations of GuiTAR.
Performance of each configuration is evaluat-
ed and experiment shows that the off-the-shelf
AR system can be effectively used for Indic

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999894344827586">
Little computational linguistics research has been
done for anaphora resolution (AR) in Indic lan-
guages. Notable research efforts in this area are
conducted by Shobha et al. (2000), Prasad et al.
(2000), Jain et al. (2004), Agrawal et al. (2007),
Uppalapu et al. (2009). These works address AR
problem in language like Hindi, some South In-
dian languages including Tamil. Dhar et al.
(2008) reported a research on Bengali. Progress
of the research through these works was difficult
to quantify as most of the authors used their self-
generated datasets and in some cases algorithms
lack in required details to make them reproduci-
ble.
First rigorous effort was taken in ICON 2011
(ICON 2011) where a shared task was conducted
on AR in three Indic languages (Hindi, Bengali,
and Tamil). Training and test datasets were pro-
vided, both the machine learning (WEKA and
SVM based classification) and rule-based ap-
proaches are used and the participating systems
(4 teams for Bengali, and 2 teams each for Hindi
and Tamil) were evaluated using five different
metrics (MUC, B3, CEAFM, CEAFE, and
BLANC). However, no team attempted to reuse
any of the off-the-shelf AR systems. This paper
aims to explore this issue to investigate how far
useful such a system is for AR in Indic lan-
guages. Bengali has been taken as the reference

language and GuiTAR (Poesio, 2004) has been
considered as the reference off-the-shelf system.
GuiTAR is primarily designed for English
language and therefore, its direct application for
Bengali is not possible for grammatical varia-
tions and resource limitations. Therefore, the
central contribution of this paper is to develop
required resources for Bengali and thereby
providing them to GuiTAR for anaphora resolu-
tion. Our contribution also includes extension of
the ICON2011 AR dataset for Bengali so that
evaluation could be done on a bigger sized da-
taset. Finally, GuiTAR anaphora resolution
module is replaced by a previously developed
approach (which is primarily rule-based,
Senapati, 2011; Senapati, 2012a) and perfor-
mances of different configurations are compared.
2 Language specific issues in GuiTAR
GuiTAR has two major modules namely, prepro-
cessing and anaphora resolution (Kabadjov,
2007). In both of these modules modifications
are required to fit it to Bengali. Let&apos;s first identify
the components in both of these two modules
where replacement/modifications are needed.
Pre-processing: The purpose of this module is
to make GuiTAR independent from input format
specifications and variations. It takes as input in
XML or text format. In case of text input, XML
file generated by the LT-XML tool. The XML
file contains the information like word bounda-
ries (tokens), grammatical classes (part-of-
speech), and chunking information. From the
XML format MAS-XML (Minimum Anaphoric
Syntax - XML) is produced to include minimal
information namely, noun phrase boundaries,
utterance boundaries, categories of pronoun,
number information, gender information, etc.
All these aspects are to be addressed for Bengali
so that for a given input discourse in Bengali,
MAS-XML file can be generated correctly. Next
section explains how this issue.
Anaphora resolution: The GuiTAR system re-
solves four types of anaphoras. The pronouns
(personal and possessive) are resolved by using

an implementation of MARS (Mitkov, 2002),
whereas different algorithms are used for resolv-
ing definite descriptions, and proper nouns. In
Mitkov’s algorithm whenever a pronoun is to be
resolved, it finds a list of potential antecedents
within a given ‘window’ and checks three types
of syntactic agreements (i.e., person, number and
gender) between an antecedent and the pronoun.
In case of more than one potential antecedent
exists in the list it would be recursively filtered
applying sequentially five different antecedent
indicators (aggregate score, immediate reference,
collocational pattern, indicating verbs and refer-
ential distance) until there is only one element in
the list, i.e., the selected antecedent. We intro-
duce suitable modifications in this module so
that the same implementation of MARS can
work for Bengali. This is explained in Sec. 4.

3.1 Number Acquisition for Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962090909091">
In Bengali, a set of nominal suffixes
(Bhattacharya, 1993) (inflections and classifier)
are used to recognize the number (singu-
lar/plural) of noun. To identify the number of a
noun, we check whether any of the nominal suf-
fixes (indicating plurality) are attached with the
noun. If found, the number of the noun is tagged
as plural. From the corpus, we identified 17 such
suffixes (e.g. ĺদর /der, রা /ra, িদেগর /diger, িদগেক
/digke, গুিল /guli, etc.) which are used for number
acquisition for nouns.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999899">
3.2 Honorificity of Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992676470589">
The honorific agreement exists in Bengali.
Honorificity of a noun is indicated by a word or
expression with connotations conveying esteem
or respect when used in addressing or referring to
a person. In Bengali three degree of honorificity
are observed for the second person and two for
the third person (Majumdar, 2000; Sengupta,
2000). The second and third person pronouns
have distinct forms for different degrees of
honorificity. Honorificity information is applica-
ble for proper nouns (person) and nouns indicat-
ing relations like father, mother, teacher, etc.
The honorificity information is identified by
maintaining a list of terms which can be consid-
ered as honorific addressing terms (e.g.
ভƲেলাক/bhadrolok, বাবু/babu, ডঃ/Dr.,
মহাশয়/mohashoy, ডা./Dr., etc.). About 20 such
terms are there in the list and we get these terms
from analysis of the Bengali corpus. When these
terms are used to add honorificity of a noun they
appear either before or after the noun. Another
additional way for identifying the honorificity
information is to look at the inflection of the
main verb which is inflected with ন/n (i.e.
বেলন/bolen, কেরন/koren etc.).
Honorificity is extracted during the pre-
processing phase and added with the attribute
hon = &lt;value&gt;. The value is set ‘sup’ (superior
i.e. highest degree of honor), ‘neu’ (neutral i.e.
medium degree of honor) or ‘inf’ (inferior i.e.
lowest degree of honor) based on their degree of
honorificity. For pronouns, this information is
available from the pronoun list (honorific singu-
lar and honorific plural) as shown in Table-1.

rule based Bengali chunker (De, 2011) is used to
get chunking information. NEIs and their classes

After adding all these information, the input text
is formatted into GuiTAR specified input XML
file and is converted into MAS-XML. This file
contains other syntactic information: person,
types of pronouns, number and honorificity. In-
formation on person and types of pronouns
comes from Table-1. Number and honorificity
are identified as explained before. Gender infor-
mation has little role in Bengali anaphora resolu-
tion and hence is not considered. Types of pro-
nouns are taken from Table-1.

4.2 GuiTAR-based Pronoun Resolution for
Bengali
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952142857143">
GuiTAR resolves pronouns using MARS ap-
proach (Mitkov, 2002) that makes use of several
agreements (based on person, number and gen-
der). Certain changes are required here as gender
agreement has no role. This agreement has been
replaced by the honorific agreement. Moreover,
the way pronouns are divided in MARS imple-
mentation is not always relevant for Bengali pro-
nouns. For example, we do not differentiate be-
tween personal and possessive pronouns but they
are separately treated in MARS. In our case, we
have only considered the personal and reflexive
pronouns while applying MARS based imple-
mentation for anaphora resolution.
In case of more than one antecedent found,
GuiTAR resolves it by using five antecedent in-
dicators namely, aggregate score, immediate ref-
erence, collocational pattern, indicating verbs
and referential distance. For Bengali, the indicat-
ing verb indicator has no role in filtering the an-
tecedents and hence removed.

<bodyText confidence="0.998223875">
The modified GuiTAR system has been evaluat-
ed by the dataset as described above. The dataset
contains 1647 pronouns out of them 706 are per-
sonal pronouns (including reflexive pronouns).
As the MARS in GuiTAR resolves only personal
pronouns, we have used only these personal pro-
nouns for evaluation. Three different systems are
configured as described below:
System-1 (Baseline): A baseline system is con-
figured by considering the most recent noun
phrase as the referent of a pronoun (the first noun
phrase in the backward direction is the anteced-
ent of a pronoun).
System-2 (GuiTAR with MARS): In this config-
uration, GuiTAR is used with the modifications
(as described in Sec. 4.1) in its preprocessing
module and the modified MARS (as described in
Sec. 4.2) is used for pronominal anaphora resolu-
tion (PAR).
System-3 (GuiTAR with new a PAR module):
Under this configuration, GuiTAR is used with
the modifications (as described in Sec. 4.1) in its
pre-processing module but MARS is replaced by
a previously developed system (Senapati, 2011;
Senapati, 2012a) for pronominal anaphora reso-
lution in Bengali. This is basically a rule-based
system. For every noun phrase (i.e. a possible
antecedent) the method first maintains a list of
possible pronouns which the antecedent could
attach with (note that any noun phrase cannot be
referred by any pronoun). On encountering a
pronoun, the method searches for the antecedents
for which the pronoun is in the respective pro-
noun-lists. If there is more than one such ante-
cedent, a set of rules is applied to resolve. The
approach for applying the rules is similar to the
one proposed by Baldwin (1997).
The evaluation has used five metrics namely,
MUC, B3, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC. The
experimental results are reported in Table 4. Re-
sults show that GuiTAR with MARS gives better
result than the situation where the most recent
antecedent is picked (i.e. the baseline system).
This improvement is statistically significant
(p&lt;0.03 in a two-sided t-test). When MARS is
replaced by system-3, further improvement is
achieved which is also statistically significant
(p&lt;0.01).

6.1 Error analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993836">
Analysis of errors shows that errors in number
acquisition and identification of the honorificity
are two major errors during preprocessing phase.
These errors propagate and result in further er-
rors during resolution. Resolution process itself
introduces some new errors. For example, some
Bengali personal pronouns are ambiguous
(sometimes they are anaphoric whereas in other
cases they may appear as non-anaphoric too).
তার/tar, cস/se are two examples of such pronouns
in Bengali (Senapati, 2012b) and the present res-
olution system is not able to resolve such cases.

<bodyText confidence="0.999931095238095">
The present experiment shows that GuiTAR
which is one of the off-the-shelf anaphora resolu-
tion systems can be effectively configured for
Bengali. Basic NLP information required by
GuiTAR pre-processing module has been sup-
plied mostly through automatic tools. A suitable
tool is needed for NEI in Bengali. This can be
explored in future. It is also revealed that MARS
based implementation in GuiTAR is not very
suitable for Bengali because the antecedent indi-
cators used by MARS are probably not very ef-
fective for Bengali. Suitably designed rule based
system could produce better result as shown in
the experiment. Addition of other resolution al-
gorithms is definitely a future extension of this
study. Resolution of non-personal pronouns
(which were not considered here) would be ad-
dressed next. In future, the similar experiment
can be easily extended to other Indic languages
(especially for Hindi and Tamil for which anno-
tated data is available).

The evaluation has used five metrics namely, MUC, B3, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC. The experimental results are reported in Table 4. Results show that GuiTAR with MARS gives better result than the situation where the most recent antecedent is picked (i.e. the baseline system). This improvement is statistically significant (p&lt;0.03 in a two-sided t-test). When MARS is replaced by system-3, further improvement is achieved which is also statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). 6.1 Error analysis Analysis of errors shows that errors in number acquisition and identification of the honorificity are two major</context>

In case of more than one antecedent found, GuiTAR resolves it by using five antecedent indicators namely, aggregate score, immediate reference, collocational pattern, indicating verbs and referential distance. For Bengali, the indicating verb indicator has no role in filtering the antecedents and hence removed. 5 Data and data format To evaluate the configured GuiTAR system the dataset provided by ICON 2011(ICON 2011) has been used.

Our contribution also includes extension of the ICON2011 AR dataset for Bengali so that evaluation could be done on a bigger sized dataset. Finally, GuiTAR anaphora resolution module is replaced by a previously developed approach (which is primarily rule-based, Senapati, 2011; Senapati, 2012a) and performances of different configurations are compared. 2 Language specific issues in GuiTAR GuiTAR has two major modules namely, preprocessing and anaphora resolution (Kabadjov, 2007). In both of these modules modifications are required to fit it to Bengali. Let&apos;s first identify the components in both of these two modules where replacement/modifications are needed. Pre-processing: The purpose of this module is to make GuiTAR independent from input format specifications and variations. It takes as input in XML or text format. In case of text input, XML file generated by the LT-XML tool. The XML file contains the information like word boundaries (tokens), grammatical classes (part-ofspeech), and chunking information.

In Bengali three degree of honorificity are observed for the second person and two for the third person (Majumdar, 2000; Sengupta, 2000). The second and third person pronouns have distinct forms for different degrees of honorificity. Honorificity information is applicable for proper nouns (person) and nouns indicating relations like father, mother, teacher, etc. The honorificity information is identified by maintaining a list of terms which can be considered as honorific addressing terms (e.g. ভƲেলাক/bhadrolok, বাবু/babu, ডঃ/Dr., মহাশয়/mohashoy, ডা./Dr., etc.).
