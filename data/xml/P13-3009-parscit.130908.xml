Natural language can be easily understood by
everyone irrespective of their differences in
age or region or qualification. The existence
of a conceptual base that underlies all natural
languages is an accepted claim as pointed out
by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency
(CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and
theories in Indian grammatical tradition, we
propose a new set of meaning primitives in
this paper. We claim that this new set of
primitives captures the meaning inherent in
verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and
computable ontological classification of
verbs. We have identified seven primitive
overlapping verb senses which substantiate
our claim. The percentage of coverage of
these primitives is 100% for all verbs in
Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in
English.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996018367347">
Communication in natural language is simple.
Looking at the ease to learn and communicate in
and across natural languages, the claim of
existence of interlingual conceptual base
(Schank, 1972) seems plausible .
Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory tried to
represent a conceptual base using a small set of
meaning primitives. To achieve this goal, they
put forward a proposal consisting of a small set
of 12 primitive actions, a set of dependencies
which connects the primitive actions with each
other and with their actors, objects, instruments,
etc. Their claim was that this small set of
representational elements could be used to
produce a canonical form for sentences in
English as well as other natural languages.
Representational theories like Scripts, Plans,
Goals and Understanding(SPGU) representations
(Schank and Abelson, 1977) were developed
from the CD theory. None of the descendant
theories of CD could focus on the notion of
&apos;primitives&apos; and the idea faded in the subsequent
works.
Identification of meaning primitives is an area
intensely explored and a vast number of theories
have been put forward, namely, (PRO:
Conceptual semantics (Jackendoff, 1976),
Meaning-text theory (Mel’čuk,1981), Semantic
Primes (Wierzbicka, 1996), Conceptual
dependency theory (Schank, 1972) Preference
Semantics (Wilks, 1975) CONTRA: Language of
Thought (Fodor, 1975)). Through our work, we
put forward a set of seven meaning primitives
and claim that the permutation/combination of
these seven meaning primitives along with
ontological attributes is sufficient to develop a
computational model for meaning representation
across languages.
This paper looks at the Conceptual
Dependency Theory created by Roger Schank
(Schank, 1973; Schank, 1975) and compares it
with theories in Indian grammatical tradition. We
discuss these in section 2 and section 3. We then
analyze if we can modify Schank&apos;s approach to
define a more efficient set of primitives. We
conclude by introducing the small set of meaning
primitives which we have found to cover all
verbs in Indian languages like Sanskrit, Hindi
and almost all verbs in English.

is: basis of natural language is conceptual.
According to the theory, during communication,
to-and-fro mapping happens between linguistic
structures and the conceptual base through
concepts. It is due to the existence of this
conceptual base and concept based mapping that
a person, who is multilingual, is able to switch
between languages easily.
The conceptual base consists of concepts and
the relations between concepts. Therefore, it is
responsible for formally representing the
concepts underlying an utterance. There are three
types of concepts: a) nominal; b) action and c)
modifier. We will concentrate only on &apos;action&apos;
since our work is related to verbs.
CD’s basic premise is that the ACTION is the
basis of any proposition that is not descriptive of
a static piece of the world. Conceptualization
consists of action, actors and cases that are
dependent on that action. An ACTOR is defined
as an animate object and an OBJECT as any
concrete physical entity. CD representations use
12 primitive ACTs out of which the meaning of
verbs, abstract and complex nouns are
constructed.
Primitives are elements that can be used in
many varied combinations to express the
meaning of what underlies a given word. In CD,
primitives were arrived at by noticing structural
similarities that existed when sentences were put
into an actor-action-object framework. Using
these acts, set of states and set of conceptual
roles, it is possible to express a large amount of
the meanings expressible in a natural language.

The Nirukta1(Sarup,1920; Kunjunni et. al., 1990)
statement &amp;quot;Verbs have operation as its
predominant element&amp;quot; proposes that “process” is
the most important element in a verb. As all
words can be derived from verbal roots, we can
say that words in a natural language are either
activities (verbs) or derived from some activity
(nouns). For example:

century BC) put forward the bhāva-based
definition to define all types of verbs. According
to Nirukta verse 1.1 (Sarup, 1920) the
characteristic that defines a verb form is its verb
having bhāva as its principal meaning. In
Sanskrit, bhāva is a morphological form of
bhavati and bhavati means &apos;happening&apos;. So
structure of bhāva can be defined as structure of
happening which is explained in section 4.1.
According to sage Vārsyāyá ṇi, Nirukta verse
1.2 (Sarup, 1920), there are 6 variants of bhāva
or verb which, we believe, can be compared to 6
fundamental processes. That is, a process &apos;verb&apos;
consists of six stages. They are:
coming into being - jāyate
&apos;is born, comes into being&apos;
existing - asti &apos;is&apos;
changing - vipariṇamate
&apos;undergoes modification&apos;
increasing - vardhate
&apos;grows, increases&apos;
diminishing - ́apaksIyate &apos;diminishes&apos;

We are trying to use existing theories in the
traditional school of Sanskrit language, namely,
Navya-Nyāya for identification and formal
representation of primitive actions. We work
within the formal framework of Neo- ́Vaisesika
Formal Ontology (NVFO)2.

<bodyText confidence="0.975591789473684">
Happening is formally conceived as punctuation
between two discrete states in a context. Since
every happening consists of minimally two
different states, there is an atomic sense of
movement in it. Movement means whenever an
action takes place two states come into existence.
The initial state, at the beginning of an action and
a final state, after the completion of the action.
The two states can be same or different. Time is
an inseparable part of this structure because
between initial and final states there can be n
number of intermediate states which are
sequential.
Happening (Sanskrit, bhavati) is the change of
state from one to another in a context. According
to Bhartṛihari (5th century CE) every verb has

́astapāda (Hutton, 2010) and Udayana (Ka ṇāda, 1986) has

&apos;sense of sequence&apos; and &apos;state&apos; in it. Hence, every
verb projects a &apos;sense of happening&apos;, making this
sense omnipresent in all verbs. Therefore,
bhavati is a &apos;universal verb&apos;. In the
nominalization of bhavati, &apos;bhāva3&apos; has a formal
structure and has been named &apos;punct&apos;4. The
formal representation of bhāva is shown in
Figure1.
The structure of (universal verb) &apos;punct&apos; is:
&lt; state1  |state2, (Context) Feature Space &gt;
The structure can also be represented in short
format as: &lt; s1 / s2  |FS (C)&gt;

From Sanskritist tradition, we have adopted the
concept of universal verb. Our original
contribution is that we have defined an
ontological structure (see Figure1) to represent
‘universal verb’ and have used it to represent the
seven primary verb senses (primitives) which we
have identified. All verbs in a language can be
represented formally using this structure.

4.2 Identifying Overlapping Verbal
senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.922153058823529">
Can we have a few number of primitive meaning
senses whose permutation / combination will
enable us to explain all meanings in a language?
Primitive verb senses in language were identified
using an approach similar to Lesk’s method
(Lesk, 1986) of finding meaning overlaps for
solving Word Sense Disambiguation problem.
All verbs and definitions of all senses of each
verb in Sanskrit (2500) and 3750 verbs in
English were collected. The verb senses were
collected from various on-line dictionaries in
both the languages. From these definitions, verbs
which are used to explicate defined verbs were
identified. The procedure followed for
3 Bhāva is defined by Patañjali as (1)existence,
(2)something that comes into being, and (3)
something that is brought into being.

an ontological form which is recursive. This form is
called &apos;punct&apos;. Using punct&apos;s categories of ́Vaisesika
ontology can be derived.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997349">
identifying frequent verbs is explained using a
sample verb &apos;fall&apos;:
Definitions of different verb senses of ‘fall’ from
two different sources are given below:
Source 1 (Dictionary.com):
(to drop or descend under the force of gravity,
as to a lower place through loss or lack of
support), (to come or drop down suddenly to a
lower position, especially to leave a standing or
erect position suddenly, whether voluntarily or
not), (to become less or lower; become of a
lower level, degree, amount, quality, value,
number, etc.; decline)
Source 2 (WordNet):
(descend in free fall under the influence of
gravity), (decrease in size, extent, or range),
(move downward and lower, but not necessarily
all the way), (move in a specified direction),
(lose an upright position suddenly), (drop
oneself to a lower or less erect position) are few
senses.
All words in bold represent ‘movement’ in a
negative manner. Since movement is the most
common concept, ‘move’ is taken as an
overlapping primitive verb sense. Other
primitives like know, do, is, have, cut, and cover
were obtained by similar procedure.
In dictionaries, overlapping verb senses used
to explicate meaning of defined verbs, show the
relatedness of two verbs. The phenomenon
known as &apos;Dictionary circularity&apos; (Wierzbicka,
1996) confirms the existence of this claim.
In WordNet, the existence of most frequently
used verbs is represented through 8 ‘common
verbs’ (Miller et. al, 1990): have/ has, be, make,
run, set, go, take and get. State is dealt with
separately in WordNet. We have modified the
‘common verbs’ concept of WordNet to include
the concept of verbiality – the ability to denote a
process developing in time (Lyudmila, 2010).
To analyze the phenomena of overlapping
meanings of verbs, we studied verbs from a
database of 3750 verbs and two other lexical
resources:WordNet, Webster English Dictionary.
From the word frequencies of the verbs in these
three resources, we calculated the percentages5 of
overlapping verb senses used to explicate
meaning of defined verbs. The results are shown
in Table 1. Total verbs (unique word forms) in

4.3 The Seven Puncts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996533272727273">
In order to handle similarities and overlaps in
meaning we have developed the concept of
overlapping verbal sense or &apos;punct&apos;. These
primitive verbal senses are intended to be
building blocks out of which meaning of verbs
can be constructed. We have identified seven
&apos;puncts&apos;. Two works WordNet (8 common verbs)
and Nirukta (6 fundamental processes) were
influential in restricting the number of
overlapping verb senses to 7. We have modified
the 8 common verbs in WordNet (have, be, get,
set, make, do, run, take) in a way that each
primitive meaning sense can be represented as a
combination of ‘state’ and ‘change’. Concepts
like exist and un-exist, join and un-join, know
and un-know, do and un-do, ascribing some
actions to some objects and un-ascribe,
movement / change and possess and un-possess
are the basic meaning senses we have identified.
‘un’ stand for opposite here. Each primitive
meaning sense consists of a sense and its
negation. We have seen that verbs across

Using this set of 7 &apos;puncts&apos; it is possible to
express meaning inherent in verbs in a language
and also to link the related verbs across
languages. We will explain this by a deeper
analysis of the seven &apos;puncts&apos; (see Table 3).
The &apos;punct&apos; can be used for identifying
similarities between verbs like &apos;fall&apos;, &apos;plummet&apos;,
&apos;flow&apos; all of which have &apos;move&apos; as primary sense
and they can be used for finding out different
senses of the same verb like &apos;break&apos;. Thus &apos;break&apos;
can have primary sense of &apos;cut&apos; and secondary
sense of &apos;do&apos; when the meaning is &apos;to destroy or
stop or interrupt or cause something to separate
something&apos;. Similarly, &apos;break&apos; can also have
&apos;move&apos; as primary sense and &apos;is&apos; as secondary
sense when the meaning is &apos;voice change of a
person or day or dawn break or breaking news &apos;.
Though a verb can have two to all seven verbal
senses, we are grouping verbs looking at just the
primary and secondary verb senses. A verb can
be in more than one group. Once they are
classified according to their primary and
secondary meanings we put verbs in groups, say
all verbs having &apos;move&apos; as primary sense and &apos;do&apos;
as secondary sense will be in a group.

We believe that every word is distinct. &apos;There
are no real synonyms and that no two words
have exactly the same meaning&apos; (Palmer, 1986
page-89). If all words are distinct how can we
show its distinctness? We have observed that
there is at least one ontological attribute which
makes each word different from the other. They
are called ontological attributes as they are
concepts like space, time, manner, reason and
sub-features like direction-linear, source,
destination, effect etc. which can be represented
inter-lingually. We have named the set of
attributes as &apos;feature set&apos;. Feature set is a part of
the context C defined in the structure of &apos;punct&apos;.
Verbs with same feature set across languages can
be cross-linked. For example, if we want to
represent verb ‘breathe’ in another language, we
just have to map the attributes identified for
‘breathe’ which are –
breathe1) move, instrument-lungs, object-air,
manner-into and out of
breathe2) say, object-something, manner- very
quietly
breathe3) open, object-wine bottle, duration-

The uniform identification of verb sense means
identifying the most general sense attached to a
verb, as done by an ordinary person. One can see
that more than one verb can be used to explicate
the meaning of a verb and there is an order in
which the verbs are used. This order helps in
finding the primary, secondary and tertiary
meaning senses. The order is found by
nominalizing verbs in a simple sentence. This
method helps in resolving inconsistencies, if any,
while identifying meaning senses. For example:
— you confuse me -&gt; you create {confusion in
me} →
—You create {{confused (state of Knowledge)
about something (object of knowledge)} in me}
→
— {You do creation of} {{‘Confused (state of
Knowledge) about something (object of
knowledge)} in me}.
In the last sentence: ‘do’ is tertiary sense, ‘know’
is secondary sense and ‘is {state of knowledge}
‘is the primary sense of verb ‘confuse’.
The seven verb senses thus identified are the
building blocks out of which meanings of verbs
are constructed. The primary and secondary
senses of all verbs in English and Sanskrit were
identified. For English verbs, the entire verb list
(3750) enlisted by Levin (Levin, 1993) including
extensions (Dang et. al, 1998; Kipper et. al,
2006; Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004) was
classified according to the new classification.
For Sanskrit verbs, data (more than 3000 verbs
(Sanskrit dhātu7) including variations in
accentuation) was collected from various
resources (Palsule, 1955; Palsule, 1961; Liebich,
1922; Varma, 1953; Kale, 1961; Apte, 1998;
Williams, 2008; Capeller, 1891). The meanings
of English verbs were obtained from various
7Patañjali&apos;s basic semantic definition of the term dhātu
is as follows :- An item which denotes by its intrinsic
denotative nature something that is brought into being
- such a thing is referred to by the term bhāva or kriyā
- is called dhātu
dictionaries (on-line English dictionaries) and
the senses were identified based on intuition.
The annotation process was to identify the
primary and secondary meaning senses of all
verbs and ontological attributes of verbs in 7
groups (all verbs with the same primary verb
senses formed one group). The annotation of
verbs was done for four languages: Sanskrit,
English, Hindi and Telugu. Verbs in Sanskrit and
English were compiled and annotated by one
trained annotator and cross-checked by an
equally trained second annotator. The differences
in annotation, around 10%, were resolved by
discussion. Annotation in Hindi and Telugu was
done by 9 and 25 annotators respectively. The
annotators were humans and native speakers of
their languages, having an idea of the new
approach. The average ratio of correctness was
64%. The classification was done manually.
Based on this classification the verb groups
formed have exhibited similarity in syntactic and
semantic behavior. The pattern of Stanford
dependency relations formed among verbs of
same groups showed a similarity of 60%. This
similarity in relations were used to form WSD
rules which helped in increasing the accuracy of
English to Hindi Anusaaraka8 Machine
Translation system output by 36.04%.

1. If two sentences have same meaning they
must have similar representation regardless of
the words used.
2. Information implicitly stated in the sentence
should be stated explicitly.
Our approach is based on two assumptions:

Identification of overlapping verbal sense
enables a classification based on meaning.
Verbal sense identification along with feature

give a better classification and understanding of

<abstract confidence="0.96108355">Natural language can be easily understood by everyone irrespective of their differences in age or region or qualification. The existence of a conceptual base that underlies all natural languages is an accepted claim as pointed out by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and theories in Indian grammatical tradition, we propose a new set of meaning primitives in this paper. We claim that this new set of primitives captures the meaning inherent in verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and computable ontological classification of verbs. We have identified seven primitive overlapping verb senses which substantiate our claim. The percentage of coverage of these primitives is 100% for all verbs in Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in English.</abstract>

In the last sentence: ‘do’ is tertiary sense, ‘know’ is secondary sense and ‘is {state of knowledge} ‘is the primary sense of verb ‘confuse’. The seven verb senses thus identified are the building blocks out of which meanings of verbs are constructed. The primary and secondary senses of all verbs in English and Sanskrit were identified. For English verbs, the entire verb list (3750) enlisted by Levin (Levin, 1993) including extensions (Dang et. al, 1998; Kipper et. al, 2006; Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004) was classified according to the new classification.

Representational theories like Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding(SPGU) representations (Schank and Abelson, 1977) were developed from the CD theory. None of the descendant theories of CD could focus on the notion of &apos;primitives&apos; and the idea faded in the subsequent works. Identification of meaning primitives is an area intensely explored and a vast number of theories have been put forward, namely, (PRO: Conceptual semantics (Jackendoff, 1976), Meaning-text theory (Mel’čuk,1981), Semantic Primes (Wierzbicka, 1996), Conceptual dependency theory (Schank, 1972) Preference Semantics (Wilks, 1975) CONTRA: Language of Thought (Fodor, 1975)). Through our work, we put forward a set of seven meaning primitives and claim that the permutation/combination of these seven meaning primitives along with ontological attributes is sufficient to develop a computational model for meaning representation across languages. This paper looks at the Conceptual Dependency Theory created by Roger Schank (Schank, 1973; Schank, 1975) and compares it with theories in Indian grammatical tradition. We discuss these in section 2 and se</context>

All words in bold represent ‘movement’ in a negative manner. Since movement is the most common concept, ‘move’ is taken as an overlapping primitive verb sense. Other primitives like know, do, is, have, cut, and cover were obtained by similar procedure. In dictionaries, overlapping verb senses used to explicate meaning of defined verbs, show the relatedness of two verbs. The phenomenon known as &apos;Dictionary circularity&apos; (Wierzbicka, 1996) confirms the existence of this claim. In WordNet, the existence of most frequently used verbs is represented through 8 ‘common verbs’ (Miller et. al, 1990): have/ has, be, make, run, set, go, take and get. State is dealt with separately in WordNet. We have modified the ‘common verbs’ concept of WordNet to include the concept of verbiality – the ability to denote a process developing in time (Lyudmila, 2010). To analyze the phenomena of overlapping meanings of verbs, we studied verbs from a database of 3750 verbs and two other lexical resources:WordNet, Webster English Dictionary. From the wor</context>

Movement means whenever an action takes place two states come into existence. The initial state, at the beginning of an action and a final state, after the completion of the action. The two states can be same or different. Time is an inseparable part of this structure because between initial and final states there can be n number of intermediate states which are sequential. Happening (Sanskrit, bhavati) is the change of state from one to another in a context. According to Bhartṛihari (5th century CE) every verb has 2 ́Vaisesika ontology, due to Kaṇāda (Rensink, 2004), Pras ́astapāda (Hutton, 2010) and Udayana (Ka ṇāda, 1986) has been formalized by Navjyoti (Tavva and Singh, 2010). 60 &apos;sense of sequence&apos; and &apos;state&apos; in it. Hence, every verb projects a &apos;sense of happening&apos;, making this sense omnipresent in all verbs. Therefore, bhavati is a &apos;universal verb&apos;.

As all words can be derived from verbal roots, we can say that words in a natural language are either activities (verbs) or derived from some activity (nouns). For example: rājā (king) is derived from (the root) rāj (to shine) vṛkṣa (tree) is derived from (the root) v (to ṛ cover) kṣā (the earth) Verb is called kriyā in Sanskrit. kriyā stands for action or activity. Verbs consists of both action and state verbs. Sage Kātyāyana (3rd 1 Nirukta (Kunjunni et.al., page-88). century BC) put forward the bhāva-based definition to define all types of verbs. According to Nirukta verse 1.1 (Sarup, 1920) the characteristic that defines a verb form is its verb having bhāva as its principal meaning. In Sanskrit, bhāva is a morphological form of bhavati and bhavati means &apos;happening&apos;. So structure of bhāva can be defined as structure of happening which is explained in section 4.1. According to sage Vārsyāyá ṇi, Nirukta verse 1.2 (Sarup, 1920), there are 6 variants of bhāva or verb which, we believe, can be compared to 6 fundamental processes. That is, a process &apos;verb&apos; consists of six stages. They are: coming into being - jāyate &apos;is born, comes into being&apos; existing - asti &apos;is&apos; changing - vipariṇa</context>

Our original contribution is that we have defined an ontological structure (see Figure1) to represent ‘universal verb’ and have used it to represent the seven primary verb senses (primitives) which we have identified. All verbs in a language can be represented formally using this structure. 4.2 Identifying Overlapping Verbal senses Can we have a few number of primitive meaning senses whose permutation / combination will enable us to explain all meanings in a language? Primitive verb senses in language were identified using an approach similar to Lesk’s method (Lesk, 1986) of finding meaning overlaps for solving Word Sense Disambiguation problem. All verbs and definitions of all senses of each verb in Sanskrit (2500) and 3750 verbs in English were collected. The verb senses were collected from various on-line dictionaries in both the languages. From these definitions, verbs which are used to explicate defined verbs were identified. The procedure followed for 3 Bhāva is defined by Patañjali as (1)existence, (2)something that comes into being, and (3) something that is brought into being. 4 The formalization in NVFO is based on the idea of an ontological form whi</context>

We claim that this new set of primitives captures the meaning inherent in verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and computable ontological classification of verbs. We have identified seven primitive overlapping verb senses which substantiate our claim. The percentage of coverage of these primitives is 100% for all verbs in Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in English. 1 Introduction Communication in natural language is simple. Looking at the ease to learn and communicate in and across natural languages, the claim of existence of interlingual conceptual base (Schank, 1972) seems plausible . Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory tried to represent a conceptual base using a small set of meaning primitives. To achieve this goal, they put forward a proposal consisting of a small set of 12 primitive actions, a set of dependencies which connects the primitive actions with each other and with their actors, objects, instruments, etc. Their claim was that this small set of representational elements could be used to produce a canonical form for sentences in English as well as other natural languages.

None of the descendant theories of CD could focus on the notion of &apos;primitives&apos; and the idea faded in the subsequent works. Identification of meaning primitives is an area intensely explored and a vast number of theories have been put forward, namely, (PRO: Conceptual semantics (Jackendoff, 1976), Meaning-text theory (Mel’čuk,1981), Semantic Primes (Wierzbicka, 1996), Conceptual dependency theory (Schank, 1972) Preference Semantics (Wilks, 1975) CONTRA: Language of Thought (Fodor, 1975)). Through our work, we put forward a set of seven meaning primitives and claim that the permutation/combination of these seven meaning primitives along with ontological attributes is sufficient to develop a computational model for meaning representation across languages. This paper looks at the Conceptual Dependency Theory created by Roger Schank (Schank, 1973; Schank, 1975) and compares it with theories in Indian grammatical tradition. We discuss these in section 2 and section 3. We then analyze if we can modify Schank&apos;s approach to define a more eff</context>
