We describe a program for assigning
correct stress contours to nominals in English.
It makes use of idiosyncratic knowledge about
the stress behavior of various nominal types
and general knowledge about English stress
rules. We have also investigated the related
issue of parsing complex nominals in English.
The importance of this work and related
research to the problem of text-to-speech is
discussed.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99561993442623">
We will discuss the analysis of English
expressions consisting of a head noun preceded
by one or more open-class specifiers: rising
prices, horse blanket, mushroom omelet, banana
bread, parish priest, gurgle detector,
quarterback sneak, blind spot, red herring,
bachelor&apos;s degree, Planck&apos;s constant, Madison
Avenue, Wall Street, Washington&apos;s birthday
sale, error correction code logic, steel industry
collective bargaining agreement, expensive toxic
waste cleanup, windshield wiper blade
replacement, computer communications network
performance analysis primer, and so forth. For
brevity, we will call such expressions
`nominals.&apos; Our main aim is an algorithm for
assigning stress patterns to such nominal
expressions; we will also discuss methods for
parsing them.
Nominals are hard to parse, since their
pre-terminal string is usually consistent with
all possible constituent structures, so that we
seem to need an analysis of the relative
plausibility of the various meanings (Marcus,
1980; Finin, 1980). Even when the constituent
structure is known (as trivially in the case of
binary nominals), nominal stress patterns are
hard to predict, and also seem to depend on
meaning (Bolinger, 1972; Fudge, 1984;
Selkirk, 1984). This is a serious problem for
text-to-speech algorithms, since nominal
expressions are common at the ends of
phrases, and the location of a phrase&apos;s last
accent has a large effect on its sound.
Complex nominals are common in most kinds
of text; for example, in the million words of
the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kueera, 1982),
there are over 75,000 nominals containing
more than two words.
However, we have been able to make
some progress on the problems of parsing and
stress assignment for nominals in unrestricted
text. This paper concentrates on the
representation and use of knowledge relevant
to the problem of assigning stress; this same
knowledge turns out to be useful in parsing.
For the purposes of this paper, we will be
dealing with nominals in contexts where the
default stress pattern is not shifted by
phenomena such as as intonational focus or
contrastive stress, exemplified below:
(1) a. We&apos;re only interested in solvable
problems. (words like only depend
on stress to set their scope —
otherwise, this nominal&apos;s main stress
would be on its final word.)
b. He&apos;s a lion-tamer, not a lion-hunter.
(in a non-contrastive context, these
nominals&apos; main stresses would be on
their penultimate words.)
These interesting phenomena rarely&apos; shift
main phrase stress in expository text, and are

nominals in phrase-final position have their main stress

best seen as a modulation of the null-
hypothesis stress patterns.
argue here for this point of view, but some
illustrative examples may help make our
position clearer.
We have argued elsewhere (Liberman and
Sproat, 1987) for the following positions: (i)
the syntax of modification is quite free —
various modifiers of nominal heads (including
adjectives, nouns, and possessives) may occur
as sisters of any X-bar projection of the
nominal head; (ii) modification at different
X-bar levels expresses different types of
meaning relations (see also Jackendoff, 1973);
(iii) the English nominal system includes many
special constructions that do not conform to
the usual specifier-head patterns, such as
complex names, time and date expressions,
and so forth; (iv) the default stress pattern
depends on the syntactic structure.
Points (ii) and (iv) are common opinions
in the linguistic literature. In particular, we
support generative phonology&apos;s traditional
view of phrasal stress rules, which is that
structures of category N° have the pattern
assigned by the compound stress rule, which
makes left-hand subconstituents stress-
dominant unless their right-hand sisters are
lexically complex.2 In simple binary cases, this
amounts to left-hand stress. All other
structures are (recursively) right stressed,
according to what is called the nuclear stress
rule.3
Points (i) and (iii) are less commonplace.
They make it impossible to predict stress from
the preterminal string of a binary nominal,
since the left-hand element may be attached at
any bar level, or may be involved in some
special construction. We do not have space to
2. Various authors (e.g. Liberman &amp; Prince 1977, Hayes
1980) have suggested that the behavior of the
compound stress rule, which in fact applies to
compound nouns but not to compound adjectives or
verbs, is related to the tendency of non-compound
English nouns to have their main stress one syllable
farther back than equivalent verbs or adjectives. This
generalization strengthens the argument that [11 1■11
constituents with left-hand stress are of parent category
No.

(1977), Hayes (1980) for various versions of these

<bodyText confidence="0.997945309523809">
Examples of adjectives and possessives
within N° include sticky bun, black belt, safe
house, straight edge, sick room, medical
supplies, cashier&apos;s check, user&apos;s manual, chefs
knife, Melzer&apos;s solution, etc. We can see that
this is not simply a matter of non-
compositional semantics by contrasting the
stress pattern of red herring, blue moon, Irish
stew, hard liquor, musical chairs, dealer&apos;s
choice, Avogadro&apos; s number, cat&apos;s pajamas. The
N° status of e.g. user&apos;s manual can be seen by
its stress pattern as well as its willingness to
occur inside quantifiers and adjectives: three
new user&apos;s manuals, but *three new John&apos;s
books. In addition, there are several classes of
possessive phrases that take right-hand stress
but pattern distributionally like adjectives, i.e.
occur at NI level, as in three Kirtland&apos; s
Warblers. Examples of nouns at NI level
include the common &apos;material-made-of&apos;
modifiers (such as steel bar, rubber boots,
paper plate, beef burrito,), as well as most time
and place modifiers (garage door, attic roof,
village street, summer palace, spring cleaning,
holiday cheer, weekend news), some types of
modification by proper names (India ink,
Tiffany lamp, Miami vice, Ming vase), and so
on.
Thus a stress-assignment algorithm must
depend on meaning relationships between
members of the nominal, as well as the
collocational propensities of the words
involved.
We have written a program that performs
fairly well at the task of assigning stress to
nominals in unrestricted text. The input is a
constituent structure for the nominal, and the
output is a representation of its stress contour.
Some examples of nominals to which the
program assigns stress correctly are given in
(2), where primary stress is marked by
boldface and secondary stress by italics:

There are two main components to the
program, the first of which deals almost
exclusively with binary nominals and the
second which takes n-ary nominals and figures
out the stress pattern of those. We deal with
each in turn.

2. Binary Nominals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999779">
Much of the work in assigning stress to
nominals in English involves figuring out what
to do in the binary cases, and this section will
discuss how various classes of binary (and
some n-ary nominals, n&gt;2) are handled. For
example, to stress [[Boston University]
[Psychology Department]] correctly it is
necessary to know that Psychology Department
is stressed on the left-hand member. Once
that is known, the stress contour of the whole
four-member nominal follows from general
principles, which will be outlined in the
subsequent section of this paper.
To determine the stress pattern of a
binary nominal, the following procedure is
followed:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.556312">
1. First of all, check to see if the nominal is
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97880156">
listed as being one of those which is
exceptionally stressed. For instance, our list
of some 7000 left-stressed nominals includes
[morning sickness], which will thus get left
stress despite the general preference for right
stress in nominals where the left-hand member
is construed as as describing a location or time
for the right-hand member. [Morning
prayers], which follows the regular pattern, is
stressed correctly by the program. Similarly,
[Easter Bunny] is listed as taking left stress
whereas [Easter feast] is correctly stressed on
the right. There is a common misconception
to the effect that all and only the lexicalized
(i.e. listed) nominal expressions are left-
stressed. This is false: lexicalization is neither
a necessary nor a sufficient condition for left
stress. Dog annihilator is left-stressed
although not a member of the phrasal lexicon,
and red herring is right-stressed although it
must be lexically listed. Such examples abound
(see, also, section 1).
2. If the nominal is not listed, check through
all of the heuristic patterns that might fit it. A
few examples of these patterns are given below
— some of them are semantic or pragmatic in
character, others are syntactic, and others are
simply lexical. Note that there is not an easy
boundary (for such an algorithm) between a
pattern based on meaning and one based on
word identity, since semantic classes
correspond roughly to lists of words.
MEASURE-PHRASE: the left-hand member
describes a unit of measure in terms of which
the right-hand member is valued. Examples:
dollar bill, pint jug, 5 gallon tank... These
normally take right stress.
LOCATION-TIME-OR-SUBSTANCE: the
left-hand member describes the location or
time of the right-hand member, or else a
substance out of which the right-hand member
is made. Location examples: kitchen towel,
downstairs bedroom, city hall... Time
examples: Monday morning, Christmas Day,
summer vacation... Substance examples: wood
floor, china doll, iron maiden. These normally
take right stress.
ING-NOMINAL, AGENT-NOMINAL,
DERIVED-NOMINAL: All of these are cases
&apos;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992292">

<bodyText confidence="0.9978263">
where the right-hand member is a noun
derived from a verb, either by affix -ing
(sewing), -er (catcher) or some other affix
(destruction). Nominals with these typically
have left-hand stress if the left-hand member
can be construed as a grammatical object of
the verb contained in the right-hand member:
dog catcher, baby sitting, automobile
demolition. On the other hand if the left-hand
member is a subject of the verb in the right-
hand member then stress is usually right-hand:
woman swimmer, child dancing, student
demonstration.
NOUN-NOUN: If both elements are nouns,
and no other considerations intervene, left-
hand stress occurs a majority of the time.
Therefore a sort of default rule votes for left-
hand stress when this pattern is matched.
Examples of correct application include: dog
house, opera buff, memory cache. Not much
weight is given to this possibility, since
something which is simply possibly a left-
stressed noun-noun compound may be many
other things as well. Complex typologies of
the meaning relations in noun-noun
compounds can be found in Lees (1960),
Quirk et al. (1972), Levi (1978). These
typologies cross-cut the stress regularities in
odd ways, and are semantically rather
inhomogeneous as well, so their usefulness is
questionable.
SELF: The left-hand member is the word self
(e.g., self promotion, self analysis...). Right-
hand stress is invariably assigned, since self is
anaphoric, hence destressed following the
normal pattern for anaphors.
PLACE-NAME: The right-hand member is a
word like pond, mountain, avenue etc., and the
left-hand member is plausibly a name. These
cases get right-hand stress. Obviously, names
ending in the word Street are an exception
([Madison Avenue] vs. [Wall Street]).
All of the applicable patterns for a given
nominal are collected. Each pattern has a
weight. For instance, as noted above, little
weight is given to the observation that a
particular nominal may be a noun-noun
compound, since the preterminal string (N N]
often belongs to categories that yield right-
hand stress. On the other hand, if the analysis
and its stress pattern are almost certain, as it is
for sequences of the form (self N], then much
weight is given to this pattern. The weights
are tallied up as &apos;votes&apos; for assigning to one
member or the other. The pattern with the
most votes wins. Currently the weights are
assigned in an ad hoc manner by hand; we
plan to replace the manual weight assignment
with the results of a statistical survey of
nominal types in various forms of English.

3. Assigning Stress to N-Ary Nominals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990235294118">
Given the stress pattern of binary cases,
assigning stress to the general n-ary case is
straightforward. The algorithm implemented
is a version of one developed over the years by
various researchers, including Chomsky and
Halle (1968), Liberman and Prince (1977),
Hayes (1980), Prince (1983) and others. Main
stress is assigned to each level of constituent
structure recursively, with relative stress values
normally preserved as larger pieces of
structure are considered. A convenient
representation for tallying stress is the so-
called &apos;metrical grid&apos;; each word is associated
with a set of marks or ticks on a grid whose
higher, sparser levels correspond to metrically
more important positions. For example, dog
catcher would be represented as:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.180376">
(3)
dog catcher
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997937">
The fact that dog has two ticks as opposed
to the one tick assigned to catcher is indicative
of the stress prominence of dog.
When we combine two constituents
together we upgrade the ticks of the highest
tick-column of the weakest member to be the
same as the highest column of the strongest
member. For instance if we combine dog
catcher with training school board meeting we
will proceed by the following method:

<bodyText confidence="0.999264">
As a result, the most stressed element in
each subunit starts out at &apos;tick parity&apos; with the
most stressed element in the other subunit.
We then increment one of these main stresses

Finally the program tests for the
applicability of the so-called Rhythm Rule.
Given the rules so far, for a nominal such as
City Hall parking lot we would expect the
following stress contour:

4. Performance of the Heuristic on 200 Binary
Nominals.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913714285714">
To get a rough idea of how well our
program is doing, we took 200 [N NJ nominals
from the Bell Labs News, and compared the
performance of the current heuristic with two
other procedures: (1) assigning stress
uniformly to the right (which is what all
current text-to-speech systems would do in
such cases) and (2) assigning stress to the left
if and only if the binary nominal can be
analyzed as consisting of a noun followed by a
noun. We had made no previous effort to
develop heuristics appropriate for the content
of this source material. The results were as
follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8588426">
(8) (i) Assigning uniform rightward stress:
45% correct.
(ii) Assigning leftward stress if N-N:
66%.
(iii) Current program: 80%.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999794058823529">
Of our program&apos;s 40-odd failures, the
cause was insufficient information in roughly
30 cases; only 10 were due to misanalysis. We
classified the failure as being due to
insufficient information when the program
could say nothing about the categorization of
either member of the compound, or could only
ascertain that it might be dealing with a noun-
noun sequence (which, the reader will recall,
is given very little weight in making a
decision). For instance, the program knows
nothing about the stress properties of chemical
terms, which invariably have right-hand stress,
and therefore failed on gallium arsenide and
several similar expressions. If the program
had some information about at least one of the
words, but still came up with the wrong
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99589">
144
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936083333333">
answer, then we classified the error as a case
of misanalysis. The fact that most of the
errors were due to insufficient information
suggests that the program can be improved
substantially by increasing its set of heuristic
patterns and its knowledge of word classes.
We guess that 90-95% correct stress is a
plausible goal for [N nominals, even in
technical writing, where our experience
suggests that readers will assign left-hand and
right-hand stress to such constituents with
about equal frequency.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.908622" genericHeader="method">
5. The Parsing Issue.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995319148936">
Our stress assignment program assumes a
parsed input, not a reasonable option for a
working text-to-speech system. There is some
practical value in correct stress assignment to
binary nominals only, since they are
commoner than longer ones in most kinds of
text; in the Tagged Brown Corpus (Francis and
Kueera, 1982) we found that roughly 80% of
the complex nominals were binary, 15% were
ternary, and that therefore only about 5% had
more than three members. Still, a count of
15% for ternary nominals is significant.
Furthermore, higher percentages for complex
nominals with more than two members are
expected for technical writing than are
exhibited in the Brown Corpus. We have
therefore also investigated the use of the
stress-assignment heuristics in parsing nominal
expressions of higher complexity than binary.
How would such patterns be useful? Consider
an expression like water supply control, to
which we would want to assign the structure
[[water supply] control]. Given that we
assume binary branching, we have two
options, namely [water [supply control]] and
[(water supply] control]. While the first
analysis is not impossible, the second analysis
would be favored since one of our patterns
references the word supply, and lists substances
such as water among the types of things that
can have supplies. In effect, supply has a slot
to its left which can optionally be filled by a
noun referring to a substance or commodity of
some kind, among which water is a prominent
example. The word supply is not nearly so
close to the core examples of likely arguments
for control. Of course, listed complex
nominals straightforwardly aid in parsing: a
nominal such as City Hall parking lot is fairly
easy to analyze given that in any case City Hall
and parking lot are in our phrasal lexicon.
It seems clear that substantial amounts of
lexical knowledge are necessary to parse
complex nominals. This comes as no surprise,
in light of much recent linguistic work
suggesting that a substantial portion of
linguistic knowledge resides &apos;in the lexicon.&apos;
