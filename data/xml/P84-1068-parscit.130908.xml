This paper describes the design of a prototype
machine translation system for a sublanguage of
job advertisements. The design is based on the hy-
pothesis that specialized linguistic subsystems may
require special computational treatment and that
therefore a relatively shallow analysis of the text
may be sufficient for automatic translation of the
sublanguage. This hypothesis and the desire to mi-
nimize amputation in the transfer phase has led to
the adoption of a flat tree representation of the
linguistic data.

The most promising results in computational
linguistics and specifically in Machine Translation
(MT) have been obtained where applications were
limited to languages for special purposes and to
restricted text types (Kittredge, Lehrberger, 1982).
In light of these prospects, the prototype MT sys-
tem described below&apos; should be seen as an experi-
ment in the carputational treatment of a particular
sublanguage. The project is meant to serve both as
a didactic tool and as a vehicle for research in
MT. The development of a large-scale operational
system is not envisaged at present. The following
research objectives have been defined for this
project:
- to establish linguistic specifications of the
sublanguage as a basis for automatic processing;
- to develop translation algorithms tailored to a
computational treatment of the sublanguage.
The emphasis of the research lies in defining
the depth of linguistic analysis necessary to ade-
quately treat the complexity of the text type with
a view to acceptable machine translation. It is the
conjecture of our research group that, within the
particular sublanguage defined by our corpus, ac-
ceptable translation does not necessarily depend on
standard linguistic structural analysis but can be
obtained with a relatively shallow analysis. Thus,
as a working hypothesis, the principle of &apos;flat
trees&apos; has been adopted for the representation of
the linguistic data. Flat trees, as opposed to deep
trees, only partially reflect the dependency struc-,

adoption of flat trees goes hand in hand with the
further hypothesis that the sublanguage can be
translated mechanically with only minimal semantic
analysis similarly to the TAUMMETE0 system
(Chevalier, et al., 1978).

2. THE SUBLANGUAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878">
The corpus is taken from a weekly publication
by the Swiss government announcing federal job
openings. The wordload of this publication amounts
to ca. 10,000 words per week; however, many of the
advertisements are carried for several weeks. All
job adds are published in the three national lan-
guages: German, French and Italian, with German
usually serving as the source language (SL),
French and Italian as the target language (TL).
The study is hence based on a collection of texts
already translated by human translators. The ads
are grouped according to profession, e.g. academic,
technical, administrative, etc. At present, the
corpus is limited to the domain of administrative
positions, an example of which is given in figu-
re 1.

The corpus exhibits many of the textual fea-
tures generally used to characterize a sublanguage,
i.e. (i) limited subject matter, (ii) lexical and
syntactic restrictions, and (iii) high frequency
of certain constructions. As can be seen from the
example, the style of the sUblanguage is distin-
guished by complex nominal dependencies with va-
rious levels of coordination. In addition, most
sentences are incomplete in that they consist of a
series of nominal phrases and do not contain a main
verb; no relative phrases nor dependent clauses
occur. The importance of nominal constituents is
reflected in the statistics of the German texts:
over 55% of the words in the corpus are nouns,
11% adjectives, 11% prepositions, 17% conjunctions;
verbs only make up 1% of the corpus. A comparison
with the statistics of the French and Italian
translations reveal approximately the same distri-
bution except for infinitival verbs. The higher
frequency of verbs in French and Italian is due to
a preference for infinitival phrases in place of
devetbal nominal constructions. Apart from this
difference, the major textual characteristics
carry over from source to target sUblanguage there-
by facilitating mechanical translation.

3. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99936075">
Modern transfer-based MT systems are based on
the following design principles : (i) modularity,
e.g. separation of linguistic data and algorithms,
(ii) multilinguality i.e. independent analysis,
transfer, and generation phases, (iii) formalized
specification of the linguistic model (Hutchins,
1982). Although only a prototype, the system was
designed in accordance with these considerations.
As to modularity, the software used is a gene-
ral purpose rule-based transducer especially deve-
loped for MT (Shann, Codhard, 1984). This software
tool not only allows for the separation of data
and algorithms but also provides great flexibility
in the organization of grammars and subgrammars,
and in the control of the oorrtputational processes
applied to them.
As a multilingual system it is not directly
oriented towards any specific language pair; the
same German analysis module serves as input for
the German-French as well as the German-Italian
transfer module. Separate French and Italian gene-
ration modules use only language specific knowledge
to produce the final translation. However, the Ger-
man analysis is indirectly influenced by target
language considerations: the interface structure
between analysis and transfer was defined to take
advantage of the similarities between the three
languages and to accommodate the differences.

4. LINGUISTIC APPROACH: MININAL BUT SUFFICIENT
DEPTH
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999455384615384">
With the sdblanguage investigated displaying
restricted syntactic structures within a limited
semantic domain, a grammar specifically tailored to
these job advertisements can be defined. Moreover,
the linear series of nominal phrases as well as
the almost one-to-one lexical equivalences found
in the SL and TL texts suggest that a shallow ana-
lysis without a semantic carponent is sufficient
for adequate translation. The flat tree represen-
tation resulting from such a minimal depth approach
does not make any claim to linguistic generaliza-
bility for purposes other than the translation of
this particular sublanguage.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.933945">
4.1 Computational considerations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986484810810811">
In a transfer-based MT system, actual trans-
lation takes place in transfer and can be descri-
bed as the computational manipulation of tree
structures. In the absence of any formal theory of
translation for MT, and given the relatively well-
developed analysis techniques currently available,
a major concern in MT research is to minimize the
computation necessary in the transfer phase. A
flat tree representation provides one way of sim-
plifying the structures to be processed; an inter-
face representation defined to accommodate both
SL and TL structures in the same manner, thus
avoiding tree structure manipulation, is yet ano-
ther means. The representation of the linguistic
data in this system is a direct result of these
two considerations.
4.2 Flat trees
The fact that the linearity of the surface
structure constituents carries over from SL to the
TLs justifies the adoption of a minimal depth ana-
lysis. The analysis is restricted to the identifi-
cation of the phrasal constituents and their inter-
nal structure; dependencies holding between consti-
tuents are only partially computed. Thus, the
interface structure resulting fram analysis and
serving as input to transfer does not reflect a
linguistically correct dependency structure.
Instead, the IS respects the linear surface order
of the constituents (with the exception of predi-
cate groups, see below) in a flat tree represen-
tation.
In a flat tree, the major phrasal consti-
tuents, in particular the prepositional phrases,
are not attached at the node from which they de-
pend linguistically but at specified nodes higher.
up in the tree. Schematically, the differences
can be illustrated as follows:

nominal phrases, and (iii) verbal phrases. Samples
taken from the corpus are given below to illustrate
each of the three constituent structures.

sequence of prepositional Phrases. (GN stands for

ocnplement structure accordingly. The complete
linearization of the deverbal complements provides
a format for acconmodating the target language
infinitival construction aimed at in translation.
Structural transfer is thus reduced to renaming
the nodes; the normalized tree structure remains
the same, as can be seen in the SL and TL repre-
sentations Shown below.

4.3 Normalized tree structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958433483870968">
In order to further minimize manipulation of
structure in transfer, the interface representation
is also normalized for two important categories in
the sublanguage, namely deverbal nominal phrases
(Gann and noun and prepositional phrases (CN). The
structures are defined such that they remain valid
for both the source and target language.
4.3.1 Deverbal nominal phrases
A marked stylistic difference between the SL
and the TLs occurring with high frequency in the
corpus is the translation of a German deverbal noun
into an infinitive in French and Italian. With the
deverbal noun in German usually serving as the head
of a complex nominal structure with several comple-
ments, the translation of the noun into an infini-.
Certain noun phrases in German (e.g. genetive
attributes) are translated into prepositional
phrases in French and Italian. In order to avoid
structural transfer of noun phrases into preposi-
tional phrases and vice-versa, a normalized form
for noun phrases has been defined which reserves
a position in the tree for prepositions. For stan-
dard noun phrases a special value =1&apos;4 has been
defined to fill the empty preposition slot. There-
fore, in the transfer phase, a translation from a
noun phrase to a prepositional phrase or vice-
versa is merely a change in the value of the pre-
positional slot without any Change in the tree
structure.

4.4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRANSLATION

general, has to be to carry over the information

in terms of TL conventions, and to respect the
style of the text type. It seems that treating a
well-defined sublanguage enhances the possibili-
ties for an MT system to answer these requirements.
In fact, the sublanguage itself suggests possible
strategies for dealing with some of the classical
translation problems in MT such as (1) lexical
aMbiguity, (2) translation of prepositions, and
(3) treatment of coordination.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.691875">
4.4.1 Lexical problems
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996887137931035">
Two well-known lexical problems in computatio-
nal linguistics are homograph resolution and poly-
semy disambiguation. Given the small nuMber of
possible syntactic structures in the sublanguage,
the few homographs found in the corpus do not pre-
sent any problems for analysis. In turn, the limi-
ted semantic domain of the sublanguage completely
eliminates multiple word senses so that the trans-
fer of lexical meanings. is basically a one-to-one
Napping. Therefore, with the nouns serving as the
major carriers of the textual meaning, lexical
transfer ensures that the information content of
the text is carried over.
4.4.2 Translation of prepositions
The fact that the types of nouns occurring in
the sublanguage are restricted and repetitive and
that the possible prepositions carmanded by any
given noun is small in number (max. 3 in the cor-
pus) allows the adoption of a limited noun-focused
approach for the translation of prepositions. In
such an approach, it is the particular noun or
noun class rather than general semantic features
that determine the translation of pLepusitions.
At present, the information relevant to correct
translation of prepositions is attached to indi-
vidual noun entries in the transfer dictionary;
semantic noun subclassification similar to other
sublanguage resPArch (Sager, 1982) is being
investigated.

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9248553">
With SL and TLs exhibiting parallel surface
syntactic structure, and with inherent aMbiguities
of scope therefore carrying over, analysis of co-
ordination remains shallow. Conjunctions and in-
trasentential punctuation are defined functionally
as coordinators to yield, in keeping with the flat
tree representation, a structure such as the one

<bodyText confidence="0.999799333333333">
The evidence available to-date seems to Show
that, for the particular sublanguage dealt with,
correct translation is feasible under the hypo-
theses described in this paper. The non-generali-
zability of such an approach is quite evident;
however, the fact that such a &apos;minimal depth&apos; ap-
proach seems to work for this particular sublan-
guage gives substance to the impression that spe-
cialized linguistic subsystems differ quite
sharply, both in wriplexity and linguistic fea-
tures, from the standard language and may there-
fore require special computational treatment.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM Modern transfer-based MT systems are based on the following design principles : (i) modularity, e.g. separation of linguistic data and algorithms, (ii) multilinguality i.e. independent analysis, transfer, and generation phases, (iii) formalized specification of the linguistic model (Hutchins, 1982). Although only a prototype, the system was designed in accordance with these considerations. As to modularity, the software used is a general purpose rule-based transducer especially developed for MT (Shann, Codhard, 1984). This software tool not only allows for the separation of data and algorithms but also provides great flexibility in the organization of grammars and subgrammars, and in the control of the oorrtputational processes applied to them. multilingual system it is not directly oriented towards any specific language pair; the same German analysis module serves as input for the German-French as well as the German-Italian transfer module. Separate French and Italian generation modules use only language specific knowledge to produce the final translation. However, the German analysis is indirectly influenced by target language considerations: the interface structure between analysis and transfer was defined to take advantage of the similarities between the three languages and to accommodate the differences. LINGUISTIC APPROACH: MININAL SUFFICIENT DEPTH With the sdblanguage investigated displaying restricted syntactic structures within a limited semantic domain, a grammar specifically tailored to these job advertisements can be defined. Moreover, the linear series of nominal phrases as well as the almost one-to-one lexical equivalences found in the SL and TL texts suggest that a shallow analysis without a semantic carponent is sufficient for adequate translation. The flat tree representation resulting from such a minimal depth approach does not make any claim to linguistic generalizability for purposes other than the translation of this particular sublanguage. considerations MT system, actual translation takes place in transfer and can be described as the computational manipulation of tree structures. In the absence of any formal theory of translation for MT, and given the relatively welldeveloped analysis techniques currently available, a major concern in MT research is to minimize the computation necessary in the transfer phase. A flat tree representation provides one way of simplifying the structures to be processed; an interface representation defined to accommodate both SL and TL structures in the same manner, thus avoiding tree structure manipulation, is yet another means. The representation of the linguistic data in this system is a direct result of these two considerations. trees The fact that the linearity of the surface structure constituents carries over from SL to the TLs justifies the adoption of a minimal depth analysis. The analysis is restricted to the identification of the phrasal constituents and their internal structure; dependencies holding between constituents are only partially computed. Thus, the interface structure resulting fram analysis and serving as input to transfer does not reflect a linguistically correct dependency structure. Instead, the IS respects the linear surface order of the constituents (with the exception of predicate groups, see below) in a flat tree representation. In a flat tree, the major phrasal constituents, in particular the prepositional phrases, are not attached at the node from which they depend linguistically but at specified nodes higher. up in the tree.

The structures are defined such that they remain valid for both the source and target language. nominal phrases A marked stylistic difference between the SL and the TLs occurring with high frequency in the corpus is the translation of a German deverbal noun into an infinitive in French and Italian. With the deverbal noun in German usually serving as the head of a complex nominal structure with several complements, the translation of the noun into an infini-. Certain noun phrases in German (e.g. genetive attributes) are translated into prepositional phrases in French and Italian. In order to avoid structural transfer of noun phrases into prepositional phrases and vice-versa, a normalized form for noun phrases has been defined which reserves a position in the tree for prepositions. For standard noun phrases a special value =1&apos;4 has been defined to fill the empty preposition slot. Therefore, in the transfer phase, a translation from a noun phrase to a prepositional phrase or viceversa is merely a change in the value of the prepositional slot without any Change in the tree structure. 5. of the normalized form for NPs and PPs. TRANSLATION goal of the system, and perhaps of general, has to be to carry over the information content from SL to TL, to produce output acceptable 336 in terms of TL conventions, and to respect the style of the text type. It seems that treating a well-defined sublanguage enhances the possibilities for an MT system to answer these requirements. In fact, the sublanguage itself suggests possible strategies for dealing with some of the classical translation problems in MT such as (1) lexical aMbiguity, (2) translation of prepositions, and (3) treatment of coordination. problems Two well-known lexical problems in computational linguistics are homograph resolution and polysemy disambiguation. Given the small nuMber of possible syntactic structures in the sublanguage, the few homographs found in the corpus do not present any problems for analysis. In turn, the limited semantic domain of the sublanguage completely eliminates multiple word senses so that the transfer of lexical meanings. is basically a one-to-one Napping. Therefore, with the nouns serving as the major carriers of the textual meaning, lexical transfer ensures that the information content of the text is carried over. of prepositions The fact that the types of nouns occurring in the sublanguage are restricted and repetitive and that the possible prepositions carmanded by any given noun is small in number (max. 3 in the corpus) allows the adoption of a limited noun-focused approach for the translation of prepositions. In such an approach, it is the particular noun or noun class rather than general semantic features that determine the translation of pLepusitions. At present, the information relevant to correct translation of prepositions is attached to individual noun entries in the transfer dictionary; semantic noun subclassification similar to other sublanguage resPArch (Sager, 1982) is being investigated. and TLs exhibiting parallel surface syntactic structure, and with inherent aMbiguities of scope therefore carrying over, analysis of coordination remains shallow.

The evidence available to-date seems to Show that, for the particular sublanguage dealt with, correct translation is feasible under the hypotheses described in this paper. The non-generalizability of such an approach is quite evident; however, the fact that such a &apos;minimal depth&apos; approach seems to work for this particular sublanguage gives substance to the impression that specialized linguistic subsystems differ quite sharply, both in wriplexity and linguistic features, from the standard language and may therefore require special computational treatment.</abstract>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM Modern transfer-based MT systems are based on the following design principles : (i) modularity, e.g. separation of linguistic data and algorithms, (ii) multilinguality i.e. independent analysis, transfer, and generation phases, (iii) formalized specification of the linguistic model (Hutchins, 1982). Although only a prototype, the system was designed in accordance with these considerations. As to modularity, the software used is a general purpose rule-based transducer especially developed for MT (Shann, Codhard, 1984). This software tool not only allows for the separation of data and algorithms but also provides great flexibility in the organization of grammars and subgrammars, and in the control of the oorrtputational processes applied to them. As a multilingual system it is not directly oriented towards any specific language pair; the same German analysis module serves as input for the</context>
