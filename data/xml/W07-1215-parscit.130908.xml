We examine the feasibility of harvesting
a wide-coverage lexicon of English verbs
from the FrameNet semantically annotated
corpus, intended for use in a practical natural
language understanding (NLU) system. We
identify a range of constructions for which
current annotation practice leads to prob-
lems in deriving appropriate lexical entries,
for example imperatives, passives and con-
trol, and discuss potential solutions.

Although the lexicon is the primary source of infor-
mation in lexicalised formalisms such as HPSG or
CCG, constructing one manually is a highly labour-
intensive task. Syntactic lexicons have been derived
from other resources — the LinGO ERG lexicon
(Copestake and Flickinger, 2000) contains entries
extracted from ComLex (Grishman et al., 1994),
and Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) acquire a
CCG lexicon from the Penn Treebank. However,
one thing these resources lack is information on how
the syntactic subcategorisation frames correspond to
meaning.
The output representation of many “deep” wide
coverage parsers is therefore limited with respect to
argument structure — sense distinctions are strictly
determined by syntactic generalisations, and are
not always consistent. For example, in the logi-
cal form produced by the LinGO ERG grammar,
the verb end can have one of two senses depend-
ing on its subcategorisation frame: end v 1 rel
or end v cause rel, corresponding to the cel-
ebrations ended and the storm ended the celebra-
tions respectively. Yet a very similar verb, stop, has
a single sense, stop v 1 rel, for both the cele-
brations stopped and the storm stopped the celebra-
tions. There is no direct connection between these
different verbs in the ERG lexicon, even though
they are intuitively related and are listed as belong-
ing to the same or related word classes in semantic
lexicons/ontologies such as VerbNet (Kipper et al.,
2000) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).
If the output of a deep parser is to be used with
a knowledge representation and reasoning compo-
nent, for example in a dialogue system, then we need
a more consistent set of word senses, linked by spec-
ified semantic relations. In this paper, we investi-
gate how straightforward it is to harvest a compu-
tational lexicon containing this kind of information
from FrameNet, a semantically annotated corpus of
English. In addition, we consider how the FrameNet
annotation system could be made more transparent
for lexical harvesting.
Section 2 introduces the FrameNet corpus, and
section 3 discusses the lexical information required
by frame-based NLU systems, with particular em-
phasis on linking syntactic and semantic structure.
Section 4 presents the algorithm which converts the
FrameNet corpus into a frame-based lexicon, and
evaluates the kinds of entries harvested in this way.
We then discuss a number of sets of entries which
are inappropriate for inclusion in a frame-based lex-
icon: (a) ‘subjectless’ entries; (b) entries derived
from passive verbs; (c) entries subcategorising for
modifiers; and (d) entries involving ‘control’ verbs.

FrameNet1 is a corpus of English sentences an-
notated with both syntactic and semantic informa-
tion. Underlying the corpus is an ontology of
795 ‘frames’ (or semantic types), each of which
is associated with a set of ‘frame elements’ (or
semantic roles). To take a simple example, the
Apply heat frame describes a situation involving
frame elements such as a COOK, some FOOD, and
a HEATING INSTRUMENT. Each frame is, in addi-
tion, associated with a set of ‘lexical units’ which
are understood as evoking it. For example, the
Apply heat frame is evoked by such verbs as
bake, blanch, boil, broil, brown, simmer, steam, etc.
The FrameNet corpus proper consists of 139,439
sentences (mainly drawn from the British National
Corpus), each of which has been hand-annotated
with respect to a particular target word in the sen-
tence. Take the following example: Matilde fried
the catfish in a heavy iron skillet. The process of an-
notating this sentence runs as follows: (a) identify a
target word for the annotation, for example the main
verb fried; (b) identify the semantic frame which is
evoked by the target word in this particular sentence
– in this case the relevant frame is Apply heat;
(c) identify the sentential constituents which realise
each frame element associated with the frame, i.e.:
[COOK Matilde] [Apply heat fried] [FOOD the
catfish] [HEATING INSTR in a heavy iron skillet]
Finally, some basic syntactic information about the
target word and the constituents realising the vari-
ous frame elements is also added: (a) the part-of-
speech of the target word (e.g. V, N, A, PREP); (b)
the syntactic category of each constituent realising a
frame element (e.g. NP, PP, VPto, Sfin); and (c)
the syntactic role, with respect to the target word,
of each constituent realising a frame element (e.g.
Ext, Obj, Dep). Thus, each sentence in the corpus
can be seen to be annotated on at least three inde-
pendent ‘layers’, as exemplified in Figure 1.

Deep parsers/grammars such as the ERG, OpenCCG
(White, 2006) and TRIPS (Dzikovska, 2004) pro-
duce more sophisticated representations with scop-
ing and referential information, but still contain a
frame-based representation as their core. The lex-
ical entries necessary for constructing such repre-
sentations specify information about orthography,
part-of-speech, semantic type and subcategorisation
properties, including a mapping between a syntactic
subcategorisation frame and the semantic frame.
An example of a TRIPS lexical entry is presented
in Figure 2, representing the entry for the verb bill
as used in the sentence discussed above. Note that
for each subcategorised argument the syntactic role,
syntactic category, and semantic role are specified.
Much the same kind of information is included in
ERG and OpenCCG lexical entries.
When constructing a computational lexicon, there
are a number of issues to take into account, sev-
eral of which are pertinent to the following discus-
sion. Firstly, computational lexicons typically list
only the ‘canonical’ subcategorisation frames, cor-
responding to a declarative sentence whose main
verb is in the active voice, as in Figure 1. Other vari-
ations, such as passive forms, imperatives and dative
alternations are generated automatically, for exam-
ple by lexical rules. Secondly, parsers that build se-
mantic representations typically make a distinction
between ‘complements’ and ‘modifiers’. Comple-
ments are those dependents whose meaning is com-
pletely determined by the verb, for example the PP
on him in the sentence Mary relied on him, and are
thus listed in lexical entries. Modifiers, on the other
hand, are generally not specified in verb entries —
although they may be associated with the underlying
verb frame, their meaning is determined indepen-
dently, usually by the preposition, such as the time
adverbial next week in I will see him next week.
Finally, for deep parsers, knowledge about which
argument of a matrix verb ‘controls’ the implicit

necessary in order to to build the correct semantic
form. In a unification parser such as TRIPS, control
is usually represented by a relation of token-identity
(i.e. feature structure reentrancy) between the sub-
ject or object of a control verb and the subject of a
verbal complement.

4 Harvesting a computational lexicon from
FrameNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998186255813954">
In order to harvest a computational lexicon from the
FrameNet corpus, we took each of the 60,309 an-
notated sentences whose target word is a verb and
derived a lexical entry directly from the annotated
information. For example, from the sentence in Fig-
ure 1, the lexical entry in Figure 3 is derived.2
In order to remove duplicate entries, we made two
assumptions: (a) the value of the ARGS feature is a
set of arguments, rather than, say, a list or multiset;
and (b) two arguments are identical just in case they
specify the same syntactic role and semantic role.
These assumptions prevent a range of inappropriate
entries from being created, for example entries de-
2Our original plan was to use the automatically generated
‘lexical entry’ files included with the most recent FrameNet re-
lease as a basis for deep parsing. However, these entries contain
so many inappropriate subcategorisation frames, of the types
discussed in this paper, that we decided to start from scratch
with the corpus annotations.
rived from sentences involving a ‘split’ argument,
both parts of which are annotated independently in
FrameNet, e.g. [Ext Serious concern] arose [Ext
about his motives]. A second group of inappropri-
ate entries which are thus avoided are those deriving
from relative clause constructions, where the rela-
tive pronoun and its antecedent are also annotated
separately:
[Ext Perp The two boys] [Ext Perp who] ab-
ducted [Obj Victim James Bulger] are likely to
have been his murderers
Finally, assuming that the arguments constitute a set
means that entries derived from sentences involving
both canonical3 and non-canonical word order are
treated as equivalent. The kinds of construction im-
plicated here include ‘quotative inversion’ (e.g. ”Or
Electric Ladyland,” added Bob), and leftwards ex-
traction of objects and dependents, for example:
Are there [Obj any places] [Ext you] want to praise
[Dep for their special facilities]?
In this paper we are mainly interested in extract-
ing the possible syntax-semantics mappings from
FrameNet, rather than the precise details of their rel-
ative ordering. Since dependents in the harvested

tactic category and syntactic role, post-verbal con-
stituent ordering can-be regulated extra-lexically by
means of precedence rules. For example, for the
TRIPS and LFG formalisms, there is a straightfor-
ward correspondence between their native syntactic
role specifications and the FrameNet syntactic roles.
After duplicate entries were removed from the re-
sulting lexicon, we were left with 26,022 distinct
entries. The harvested lexicon incorporated 2,002
distinct orthographic forms, 358 distinct frames,
and 2,661 distinct orthography-frame pairs, giving
a functionality ratio (average number of lexical en-
tries per orthography-type pair) of 9.8.
Next, we evaluated a random sample of the de-
rived lexical entries by hand. The aim here was to
identify general classes of the harvested verb entries
which are not appropriate for inclusion in a frame-
based verb lexicon, and which would need to be
identified and fixed in some way. The main groups
identified were: (a) entries with no Ext argument
(section 4.1); (b) entries derived from verbs in the
passive voice (section 4.2); (c) entries which subcat-
egorise for modifiers (section 4.3); and (d) entries
for control verbs (section 4.4).

4.1 Subjectless entries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809928571429">
The harvested lexicon contains 2,201 entries (i.e.
9% of the total) which were derived from sentences
which do not contain an argument labelled with the
Ext syntactic role, in contravention of the gener-
ally accepted constraint on English verbs that they
always have a subject.
Three main groups of sentences are implicated
here: (a) those featuring imperative uses of the tar-
get verb, e.g. Always moisturise exposed skin with
an effective emollient like E45; (b) those featuring
other non-finite forms of the target verb whose un-
derstood subject is not controlled by (or even coref-
erential with) some other constituent in the sentence,
e.g. Being accused of not having a sense of humour
is a terrible insult; and (c) those involving a non-
referential subject it, for example It is raining heav-
ily or It is to be regretted that the owner should have
cut down the trees. In FrameNet annotations, non-
referential subjects are not identified on the syntactic
role annotation layer, and this makes it more difficult
to harvest appropriate lexical entries for these verbs
from the corpus.
These entries are easy to locate in the harvested
lexicon, but more difficult to repair. Typically one
would want to discard the entries generated from
(a) and (b) as they will be derived automatically in
the grammar, but keep the entries generated from (c)
while adding a non-referential it as a subject.
Although the FrameNet policy is to annotate the
(a) and (b) sentences as having a ‘non-overt’ real-
isation of the relevant frame element, this is con-
fined to the frame element annotation layer itself,
with the syntactic role and syntactic category lay-
ers containing no clues whatsoever about understood
subjects. One rather roundabout way of differentiat-
ing between these cases would involve attempting to
identify the syntactic category and semantic role of
the missing Ext argument by looking at other en-
tries with the same orthography and semantic type.
However, this whole problem could be avoided if
understood and expletive subjects were identified on
the syntactic layers in FrameNet annotations.

4.2 ‘Passive’ entries

Many entries in the harvested lexicon were derived
from sentences where the target verb is used in the
passive voice, for example:

guards] [Dep PP Time in 1988]
As discussed above, computational lexicons do not
usually list the kinds of lexical entry derived directly
from such sentences. Thus, it is necessary to identify
and correct or remove them.
In FrameNet annotated sentences, the voice of tar-
get verbs is not marked explicitly.4 We applied the
following simple diagnostic to identify ‘passive’ en-
tries: (a) there is an Ext argument realising frame
element e; and (b) there is some other entry with the
same orthographic form and semantic frame, which
has an Obj argument realising frame element e.
Initially we applied this diagnostic to the entries
in the harvested lexicon together with a part-of-
speech tag filter. The current FrameNet release in-
cludes standard POS-tag information for each word
in each annotated sentence. We considered only
those lexical entries derived from sentences whose
target verb is tagged as a ‘past-participle’ form (i.e.
VVN). This technique identified 4,160 entries in the
harvested lexicon (i.e. 16% of the total) as being
‘passive’. A random sample of 10% of these was
examined and no false positives were found.
The diagnostic test was then repeated on the re-
maining lexical entries, this time without the POS-
tag filter. This was deemed necessary in order to
pick up false negatives caused by the POS-tagger
having assigned the wrong tag to a passive target
verb (generally the past tense form tag VVD). This
test identified a further 1007 entries as ‘passive’ (4%
of the total entries). As well as mis-tagged instances
of normal passives, this test picked up a further three
classes of entry derived from target verbs appearing
in passive-related constructions. The first of these
involves cases where the target verb is in the com-
plement of a ‘raising adjective’ (e.g. tough, difficult,
easy, impossible), for example:
[Ext NP Goal Both planning and control] are dif-
ficult to achieve [Dep PP Circs in this form of
production]
The current FrameNet annotation guidelines (Rup-
penhofer et al., 2006) state that the extracted object
in these cases should be tagged as Obj. However,
in practice, the majority of these instances appear to
have been tagged as Ext.
4Whilst there are dedicated subcorpora containing only pas-
sive targets, it is not the case that all passive targets are in these.
The second group of passive-related entries in-
volve verbs in the need -ing construction5, e.g.:
[Ext NP Content Many private problems] need
airing [Dep PP Medium in the family]
The third group involved sentences where the target
verb is used in the ‘middle’ construction:
[Ext Experiencer You] frighten [Dep
Manner easily]
Again, linguistically-motivated grammars generally
treat these three constructions in the rule component
rather than the lexicon. Thus, the lexical entries de-
rived from these sentences need to be located and
repaired, perhaps by comparison with other entries.
Of the 1007 lexical entries identified by the sec-
ond, weaker form of the passive test, 224 (i.e. 22%)
turn out to be false positives. The vast majority
of these involve verbs implicated in the causative-
inchoative alternation (e.g. John’s back arched vs.
John arched his back). The official FrameNet pol-
icy is to distinguish between frames encoding a
change-of-state and those encoding the causation
of such a change, for example Amalgamation
versus Cause to amalgamate, Motion versus
Cause motion etc. In each case, the two frames
are linked by the Causative of frame relation.
Most of the false positives are the result of a fail-
ure to consistently apply this principle in annotation
practice, for example where no causative counterpart
has been defined for a particular inchoative frame,
or where an inchoative target has been assigned to a
causative frame, or a causative target to an inchoa-
tive frame. For example, 94 of the false positives
are accounted for simply by the lack of a causative
counterpart for the Body movement frame, mean-
ing that both inchoative and causative uses of verbs
like arch, flutter and wiggle have all been assigned
to the same frame.
For reasons of data sparsity, it is expected that the
approach to identifying passive uses of target verbs
discussed here will result in false negatives, since it
relies on there being at least one corresponding ac-
tive use in the corpus. We checked a random sample
of 400 of the remaining entries in the harvested lex-
icon and found nine false negatives, suggesting that

4.3 Modifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960742857143">
General linguistic theory makes a distinction be-
tween two kinds of non-subject dependent of a verb,
depending on the notional ‘closeness’ of the seman-
tic relation — complements vs. modifiers. Take for
example the following sentence:
[Ext Performer She]’s [Dep Time currently]
starring [Dep Performance in The Cemetery
Club] [Dep Place at the Wyvern Theatre]
Of the three constituents annotated here as Dep,
only one is an complement (the Performance);
the Time and Place dependents are modifiers.
Frame-based NLU systems do not generally list
modifiers in the argument structure of a verb’s lexi-
cal entry. Thus, we need to find a means of identify-
ing those dependents in the harvested lexicon which
are actually modifiers.
The FrameNet ontology provides some informa-
tion to help differentiate complements and modi-
fiers. A frame element can be marked as Core,
signifying that it “instantiates a conceptually nec-
essary component of a frame, while making the
frame unique and different from other frames”. The
annotation guidelines state that the distinction be-
tween Core and non-Core frame elements cov-
ers “the semantic spirit” of the distinction between
complements and modifiers. Thus, for example,
obligatory dependents are always Core, as are:
(a) those which, when omitted, receive a definite
interpretation (e.g. the Goal in John arrived);
and (b) those whose semantics cannot be predicted
from their form. In the Performers and roles
frame used in the example above, the Performer
and Performance frame elements are marked as
Core, whilst Time and Place are not.
However, it is not clear that the notion of on-
tological ‘coreness’ used in FrameNet corresponds
well with the intuitive distinction between syntactic
complements and modifiers. This is exemplified by
the existence of numerous constituents in the corpus
which have been marked as direct objects, despite
invoking non-Core frame elements, for example:
[Agent I] ripped [Subregion the top]
[Patient from my packet of cigarettes]
The relevant frame here is Damaging, where the
Subregion frame element is marked as non-
Core, based on examples like John ripped his
trousers [below the knee]. Thus in this case, the
decision to retain all senses of the verb rip within
the same frame has led to a situation where seman-
tic and syntactic coreness have become dislocated.
Thus, although the Core vs. non-Core property on
frame elements does yield a certain amount of in-
formation about which arguments are complements
and which are modifiers, greater care needs to be
taken when assigning different subcategorisation al-
ternants to the same frame. For example, it would
have been more convenient to have assigned the verb
rip in the above example to the Removing frame,
where the direct object would then be assigned the
Core frame element Theme.
In the example discussed above, FrameNet does
provide syntactic role information (Obj) allowing
us to infer that a non-Core role is a complement
rather than a modifier. Where the syntactic role is
simply marked as Dep however, it is not possible
to make the decision without recourse to other lexi-
cal resources (e.g. ComLex). Since different parsers
may utilise different criteria for distinguishing com-
plements from modifiers, it might be better to post-
pone this task to the syntactic alignment module.

Unification-based parsers generally handle the dis-
tinction between subject (John promised Mary to
go) and object (John persuaded Mary to go) con-
trol verbs in the lexicon, using coindexation of the
subject/object of the control verb and the understood
subject of the embedded verb. The parser can use
this lexical information to assign the correct refer-
ent to the understood subject in a sentence like John

Content to entertain him]
The lexical entries for transitive control verbs that
we can harvest directly from these annotations thus
fail to identify whether it is the subject or the direct
object which controls the understood subject of the
embedded verb.
We attempted to automatically distinguish subject
from object control in FrameNet by looking for the
annotated sentences that contain independently an-
notated argument structures for both the control verb
and embedded verb. For example, let’s assume the
following annotation also exists in the corpus:
Perhaps we can persuade [Ext NP Agent Tam-
muz] to entertain [Obj NP Experiencer him]
We can then use the fact that it is the object of the
control verb which is coextensive with the Ext of
the embedded verb to successfully identify persuade
as an object-control verb.
The problem with this approach is data sparsity.
The harvested lexicon contains 135 distinct verbs
which subcategorise for both a direct object and
a controlled VP complement. In a random sam-
ple of ten of these none of the annotated sentences
had been annotated independently from the perspec-
tive of the governed verb. As the proportion of the
FrameNet corpus which involves annotation of run-
ning text, rather than cherry-picked example sen-
tences, increases, we would expect this to improve.6

The revised version of the harvested lexicon con-
tains 9,019 entries for 2,626 orthography-frame
pairs, yielding a functionality ratio of 3.4.
This lexicon still requires a certain amount of
cleaning up. For example, the verb accompany is
assigned to a number of distinct lexical entries de-
pending on the semantic role associated with the PP
complement (i.e. Goal, Path or Source). Cases
like this, where the role name is determined by the
particular choice of preposition, could be handled
outside the lexicon. Alternatively, it may be possible
to use the ‘core set’ feature of the FrameNet ontol-

dundancy. Other problems involve sentences where
a possessive determiner has been annotated as the
subject of a verb, e.g. It was [his] intention to aid
Larsen, resulting in numerous spurious entries.
The harvested lexical entries are encoded ac-
cording to a framework-independent XML schema,
which we developed with the aim of deriving lexi-
cons for use with a diverse range of parsers. At the
moment, several additional steps are required to con-
vert the entries we extracted into a format suitable
for a particular parser.
Firstly, the syntactic categories used by FrameNet
and the target lexicon have to be reconciled. While
basic constituent types such as noun and adjective
phrases do not change between the theories, small
differences may still exist. For example, the TRIPS
parser classifies all wh-clauses such as what he did
in I saw what he did and What he did was good as
noun phrases, the LinGO ERG grammar interprets
them as either noun phrases or clauses depending on
the context, and FrameNet annotation classifies all
of them as clauses. The alignment, however, should
be relative straightforward as there is, in general,
good agreement on the basic syntactic categories.7
Secondly, the information relevant to constituent
ordering may need to be derived, as discussed in
Section 4. Finally, the more abstract features such as
control have to be converted into feature structures
appropriate for the unification parsers. Our schema
incorporates the possibility for embedded category
structure, as in the treatment of control verbs in CCG
and HPSG where the verbal complement is an ‘un-
saturated’ category. We plan to use our schema
as a platform for deriving richer lexical represen-
tations from the ‘flatter’ entries harvested directly
from FrameNet.
As part of our future work, we expect to create
generic algorithms that help automate these steps. In
particular, we plan to include a domain-independent
set of constituent categories and syntactic role la-
bels, and add algorithms that convert between a lin-
ear ordering and a set of functional labels, for exam-
ple (Crabb´e et al., 2006). We also plan to develop
algorithms to import information from other seman-

tic lexicons such as VerbNet into the same schema.
Currently, we have implemented an algorithm for
converting the harvested entries into the TRIPS lex-
icon format, resulting in a 6133 entry verb lexicon
involving 2654 distinct orthography-type pairs. This
lexicon has been successfully used with the TRIPS
parser, but additional work remains to be done be-
fore the conversion process is complete. For exam-
ple, we need a more sophisticated approach to re-
solving the complement-modifier distinction, along
with a means of integrating the FrameNet semantic
types with the TRIPS ontology so the parser can use
selectional restrictions to disambiguate.
The discussion in this paper has been mainly fo-
cused on extracting entries for a deep lexicons us-
ing frame-based NLU, but similar issues have been
faced also by the developers of shallow semantic
parsers from semantically annotated corpora. For
example, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) found that
identifying passives was important in training a se-
mantic role classifier from FrameNet, using a parser
trained on the Penn Treebank along with a set of
templates to distinguish passive constructions from
active ones. Similarly, Chen and Rambow (2003)
argue that the kind of deep linguistic features we
harvest from FrameNet is beneficial for the success-
ful assignment of PropBank roles to constituents, in
this case using TAGs generated from PropBank to
generate the relevant features. From this perspec-
tive, our harvested lexicon can be seen as providing a
‘cleaned-up’, filtered version of FrameNet for train-
ing semantic interpreters. It may also be utilised to
provide information for a separate lexical interpreta-
tion and disambiguation module to be built on top of
a syntactic parser.

<bodyText confidence="0.999877">
We have developed both a procedure and a
framework-independent representation schema for
harvesting lexical information for deep NLP systems
from the FrameNet semantically annotated corpus.
In examining the feasibility of this approach to in-
creasing lexical coverage, we have identified a num-
ber of constructions for which current FrameNet an-
notation practice leads to problems in deriving ap-
propriate lexical entries, for example imperatives,
passives and control.

This test identified a further 1007 entries as ‘passive’ (4% of the total entries). As well as mis-tagged instances of normal passives, this test picked up a further three classes of entry derived from target verbs appearing in passive-related constructions. The first of these involves cases where the target verb is in the complement of a ‘raising adjective’ (e.g. tough, difficult, easy, impossible), for example: [Ext NP Goal Both planning and control] are difficult to achieve [Dep PP Circs in this form of production] The current FrameNet annotation guidelines (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) state that the extracted object in these cases should be tagged as Obj. However, in practice, the majority of these instances appear to have been tagged as Ext. 4Whilst there are dedicated subcorpora containing only passive targets, it is not the case that all passive targets are in these. The second group of passive-related entries involve verbs in the need -ing construction5, e.g.: [Ext NP Content Many private problems] need airing [Dep PP Medium in the family] The third group involved sentences where the target verb is used in the ‘middle’ construction: [Ext Experiencer You] frighten [Dep </context>
