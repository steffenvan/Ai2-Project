<bodyText confidence="0.9989635">
Machine translation of locative prepositions is
not straightforward, even between closely re-
lated languages. This paper discusses a sys-
tem of translation of locative prepositions be-
tween English and French. The system is
based on the premises that English and French
do not always conceptualize objects in the
same way, and that this accounts for the major
differences in the ways that locative preposi-
tions are used in these languages. This paper
introduces knowledge representations of con-
ceptualizations of objects, and a method for
translating prepositions based on these con-
ceptual representations.

This paper presents an analysis of the differ-
ences in the uses of locative prepositions in
two languages, and then describes an auto-
matic system of translation that is based on
this analysis.
Our research originated from the observa-
tion that even between two closely related lan-
guages such as English and French, locative
prepositions of even simple sentences do not
seem to be translated from one language to
the other in a clearly systematic and coherent
way. However, the translation becomes more
coherent if we introduce Herskovits&apos; idea of
the ideal meaning of a preposition (Herskovits
1986) and Lakoff&apos;s idea of Idealized Cognitive
Models (ICM&apos;s) (Lakoff 1987). A central part
of our research was to design entities based

on Lakoff&apos;s IOM&apos;s. We call these entities con-
ceptual representations of objects. The main
thesis of this paper is that, even though the
ideal meanings of the locative prepositions we
studied are the same in English and in French,
these two languages do not always conceptual-
ize the objects involved in a scene in the same
way and that this leads to differences in the
translation of locative prepositions. This the-
ory seems suitable to pairs of languages other
than English and French, as well.
In addition, we will also describe how the
system detects abnormalities and ambiguities
using knowledge required for the translation
task.
This paper is organized as follows: section
2 presents an analysis of and a solution to the
problem of translating locative prepositions
from English into French, section 3 presents
the conceptual representations of objects, sec-
tion 4 presents the algorithm we designed and
implemented for translating locative preposi-
tions, section 5 discusses the detection of ab-
normalities and ambiguities, and section 6 is
the conclusion.

<bodyText confidence="0.999876375">
We now describe the differences between En-
glish and French locative expressions and give
a possible analysis of the problem. Specifi-
cally, we concentrate on the translation of the
three locative prepositions &apos;in&apos;, &apos;on&apos;, and &apos;at&apos;,
into the French prepositions &apos;dans&apos;, &apos;sue, and
in the context of simple sentences or ex-
pressions of the form:

While in the most representative uses of loca-
tive prepositions, there is a direct correspon-
dence between English and French (&apos;in&apos; corre-
sponding to &apos;dans&apos;, &apos;on&apos; to &apos;sue, and &apos;at&apos; to

not hold.
The following pairs of sentences illustrate
cases in which the correspondences hold:

seem arbitrary. Our analysis, however, reveals
that coherence might be found.

2.2 Analysis of the problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999544333333333">
Our analysis takes its principal sources in
the works of Herskovits (1986) and Grimaud
(1988).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.678265">
2.2.1 Herskovits&apos; contribution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998853">
Herskovits (1986) contributed to the solution
to our problem by introducing the concept of
the ideal meaning of a locative preposition.
This concept is inspired by Rosch&apos;s (1977) pro-
totype theory, in which human categorization
of objects is viewed as organized around pro-
totypes (best instances of the category) and
distances from these prototypes (the shorter
the distance of an object away from a proto-
type, the more representative of the category
the object is). In the case of prepositions, pro-
totypical or ideal meanings are geometrical re-
lations between the located object, the object
whose location is being specified in the sen-
tence, and the reference object, the object in-
dicating the location of the located object.
A second contribution of Herskovits is her
case study of the three locative prepositions
&apos;in&apos;, &apos;on&apos;, and &apos;at&apos;. Our own study of 35 dif-
ferent cases is heavily based on this part of
Herskovits&apos; work.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.802706">
2.2.2 Grimaud&apos;s contribution
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999721333333333">
Grimaud (1988) presents a linguistic analy-
sis of locative prepositions in English versus
French. His theory is based on Lakoff tz John-
son (1980) and Lakoff (1987) and uses the no-
tion of conceptualizations of objects. A con-
ceptualization is a mental representation of an
object or an idea which takes into considera-
tion not only the &amp;quot;objective truth&amp;quot; about that
object or idea, but also human biological per-
ception and experience.
In his theory, Grimaud suggests that the
cases in which the correspondences described
in section 2.1 do not hold are not simply ex-
ceptional but rather are due to differences
in the ways that English and French concep-
tualize the objects involved in the relation.
The reason why the same object can be con-
ceptualized as different geometrical objects in
different languages, given a particular situa-
tion, is that objects have several properties
(or aspects) and different languages might not
choose to highlight and hide the same proper-
ties (or aspects) of a given object in a given
situation. This happens in (6), for example
(under the interpretation in which the profes-
sor is riding the bus rather than being located
on the roof of the bus)— English conceptu-
alizes the bus as a surface that can support
entities, by highlighting only its bottom plat-
form, while French conceptualizes the bus as a

volume that can contain entities, by highlight-
ing its bottom surface, its sides, and its roof
altogether. This leads to a difference in the
way that English and French express the spa-
tial relation: English uses &apos;on&apos;, the preposition

appropriate for expressing a relation between
a point and a surface, and French uses &apos;dans&apos;
(the French equivalent of the preposition
appropriate for expressing a relation between
a point and a volume. The appropriateness of
a preposition for expressing a certain relation
is determined by its ideal meanings.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.80176">
2.2.3 Our synthesis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980422">
Our task consisted of synthesizing Herskovits&apos;
and Grimaud&apos;s contributions and making this
synthesis suitable for a computational system,
since both Herskovits and Grimaud&apos;s analyses
are mainly linguistic and not directly geared
towards computation.
Our first task was to define the ideal mean-
ings of each preposition:
AT/A.:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993533">
• relation between two points.
ON/SUR:
• relation between a point and a
surface whose boundaries are ir-
relevant.
• relation between a point and a
line.
IN/DANS:
• relation between a point and a
bounded surface.
• relation between a point and an
empty volume.
• relation between a point and a full
volume.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934842105263">
Our next task was to develop a knowledge
representation of a conceptualization of an ob-
ject, that is, a representation of the way an
object can be conceptualized, given a particu-
lar language, a particular situation, etc. Typ-
ically, in our application, these conceptualiza-
tions are geometrical objects, such as points,
lines, surfaces, and volumes.
&apos;Note that Herskovits&apos; notion of ideal meaning in-
volves more information than ours: rather than the
vague term &apos;relation&apos;, Herskovits identifies the specific
sort of relation that holds between the two objects,
such as coincidence, support, and containment. For
the specific problem in translation that we address,
such specifications are unnecessary. They would be
necessary, however, in a system designed for a deeper
understanding than ours is designed to achieve.
Our final task was to design a system of
translation. Our system works as follows:
given the source-language sentence, its objec-
tive meaning (i.e., its language-independent
meaning) is derived. This is done by first us-
ing the ideal meanings of the source-language
preposition to find the conceptualization that
applies to the reference object, and then de-
riving the objective meaning of the sentence
from this conceptualization. (Because each
conceptualization of an object used as a ref-
erence object corresponds to some objective
meaning, this last step is easily performed.)
Given the objective meaning of the sentence,
the conceptualization of the reference object
that should be used in the target language
is then found. Finally, using the list of ideal
meanings of the target-language prepositions
together with the target-language conceptual-
ization, the system derives the preposition to
be used in the target-language sentence.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975190476191">
Independently, Zelinsky-Wibbelt (1990) took
an approach similar to ours to the problem of
translating locative prepositions. She worked
on translation between English and German
rather than English and French. This sup-
ports our hypothesis that the theory we use
can be extended to pairs of languages other
than English and French.
In addition to the types of expressions our
system translates, her system translates sen-
tences with verbs other than &apos;to be&apos;. The
reason why we chose not to process sen-
tences using verbs other than &apos;to be&apos; was to
study the prepositions themselves in detail,
before addressing the more complicated prob-
lem of their interactions with verbs. Zelinsky-
Wibbelt does not refer to any preliminary de-
tailed study of the prepositions themselves.
We carried on a detailed bilingual study of
locative prepositions by adapting and expand-
ing the case studies of Herskovits (1986).

3 The Conceptual Repre-
sentation of Objects
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99916725">
The central entity in our research is the
conceptual representation of objects (or con-
ceptual representation), which represents a
conceptualization together with information

<bodyText confidence="0.999520411764706">
about the conditions necessary for the con-
ceptualization to hold.
A conceptual representation of an object is
composed of a conditional part and a descrip-
tive part. The conditional part is a list of
properties of the object and of its situation
in the sentence. The former kind of prop-
erty is objective information about the ob-
ject, such as its shape, the parts it is made
of, and its function. The latter properties
are whether the object is a located or refer-
ence object, and whether the sentence is in
English or French. The descriptive part is a
description of a conceptualization of that ob-
ject. This part is conceptual, rather than ob-
jective. Here follows a detailed description of
conceptual representations.2
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998452">
3.1 The conditional part
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992856442857143">
The conditional part is made up of the follow-
ing types of properties:
* The role in the sentence of the object being
considered (located or reference object). 3
* The language in which the sentence is ut-
tered (English or French). This condition is
crucial to the system because not all conceptu-
alizations are possible in both languages, and
these differences account for differences in use
of the prepositions. This point is important,
for example, for pairs of sentences (4), where
a picture is conceptualized as a volume in En-
glish and as a surface in French; for pairs of
sentences (5), where the shade is conceptual-
ized as a volume in English and as a point in
French; and for pairs of sentences (6), where
a bus is conceptualized as a surface in English
and as a volume in French.
* The properties of the reference object that
are relevant to the objective spatial relation
expressed in the sentence (these properties are
2Certain aspects of the conceptual representations
were implemented for extensibility or for the purposes
of ambiguity and error detection. For the sake of com-
pleteness, we describe all aspects in this section, even
those not directly related to translation (see Japkowicz
1990 for further explanation of these aspects).
3Note that a located object is always conceptual-
ized as a point. This is so because the conceptualiza-
tion of the located object has no impact on the use
of the prepositions. It is the conceptualization of the
reference object that is relevant.
language independent). This part of the con-
ceptual representation specifies the objective
situation in which the object being conceptu-
alized is involved. It is central to the system
because it is common to English and French
(since it describes an objective situation) and
is the part of the conceptual representation
that allows a matching between English and
French. For example, consider (4). The prop-
erties of a picture that are relevant given the
objective meaning of the sentence are the fact
that it is the re-creator of an environment,
with entities included in that environment,
and that it is an object with a very small,
almost non-existent, width. These properties
are common to English and French. What dif-
fers are the conceptualizations: English high-
lights the first property, conceptualizing the
picture as a volume, while French highlights
the second, considering the width to be non-
existent and conceptualizing the picture as a
surface.
* World-knowledge conditions involving the
located object of the sentence (for example,
whether the located object can be supported
by the reference object). These conditions are
used to check the plausibility of a sentence
with respect to the located object. For exam-
ple, the sentences in (6) are plausible, while
the sentence
(7) The elephant is on the bus
is not, since an elephant is too heavy to be
supported by a bus. In general, this condi-
tion is used to check for abnormalities within
one language rather than to account for dif-
ferences between English and French. Section
5 describes how the system detects such ab-
normalities.

sentential constraints are pragmatic con-
straints, derived from the context in which
the sentence is uttered, that can influence the
choice of preposition. For example:
(8) The gas station is at the freeway. [Her-
skovits 1986, p. 138]
This sentence is valid only when the speaker
pictures himself or herself as being on a tra-

point of focus. At its current state, the sys-
tem deals solely with isolated sentences, so it
is unable to perform this checking.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999158">
3.2 The descriptive part
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99813325">
The descriptive part of a conceptual represen-
tation includes the following three types of in-
formation about the conceptualization: its di-
mension, its fullness, and its width.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9866326">
* Its dimension is the main information
about the conceptualization. The possible val-
ues of the dimension field include point, line,
surface, and volume.
* Its fullness can take the values empty or
full Fullness is important when, for example,
the dimension is volume. Consider the follow-
ing sentences.
(9) The girl is in the tree.
(10) The nail is in the tree.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.834575892857143">
One needs to differentiate between the situ-
ation of (9), in which the located object (the
girl) is located in the tree, and the one of (10),
in which the located object (the nail) is em-
bedded in the tree. This distinction, however,
is not needed to translate between English and
French (it might be needed with other lan-
guages, though); rather, it is needed to un-
derstand the sentence.
* Its width takes the values existent or non-
existent.4 Width is important for sentences
such as those in (4), where the width is con-
ceptualized as being non-existent in French,
and existent in English, this difference lead-
ing to a difference in the use of the locative
prepositions (French uses &apos;sue and English
uses &apos;in&apos;).
4 Remember that the descriptive part describes con-
ceptualizations. Therefore, when we describe the
width to be existent or non-existent, it is the width
in the conceptualization that is in question, not that
of the real object. Objectively, for example, a pic-
ture has a width, but this width is so small that it is
ignored in some of its conceptualizations. Objectively
also, a picture is the re-creator of an environment. The
conceptualizations in which this objective property is
highlighted have an existent width, since environments
can contain 3-dimensional entities.

4 The Algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964387">
4.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988094">
Our method of translation first transforms
the source-language sentence into a source-
language representation (the English con-
ceptual level), and then translates the
source-language representation into a target-
language representation (the French concep-
tual level). This target-language representa-
tion is finally used to generate the target-
language sentence. The algorithm works in
four phases:

4.2 Phases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986655">
In the description that follows, each step is
explained and illustrated with example (6).
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.709083">
4.2.1 Initialization
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973608695652">
The initialization phase is composed of two
steps. The first consists of parsing the in-
put sentence and returning some information
about each noun, such as its role in the sen-
tence (located or reference object), its French
translation, and certain useful French mor-
phological and syntactic information about it.
In sentence (6), for example, this informa-
tion is that &apos;Our professor&apos; is the located ob-
ject, that its French translation is &apos;Notre pro-
fesseur&apos;, and that &apos;professeue is a masculine
common noun in French; and also that &apos;bus&apos;
is the reference object, that its French trans-
lotion is &apos;bus&apos;, and that &apos;bus&apos; is a masculine
common noun in French.
The second step consists of building the
conceptual representations of the located and
reference objects (see Japkowicz 1990 and
Japkowicz &amp; Wiebe 1990). All possible
conceptual representations are built at this
point—the discrimination of those that are
relevant to the sentence from the others is
done in the next phase.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.451343">
4.2.2 Derivation of the objective
meaning of the sentence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957219512195">
This phase is also performed in two steps. The
first step identifies the English conceptual rep-
resentations relevant to the sentence, accord-
ing to the preposition used. That is, given
the ideal meaning of the preposition used in
the English sentence, certain conceptual rep-
resentations that were built in the previous
phase are discarded. In example (6), the only
conceptual representation of a bus that will re-
main is that of a surface, since the ideal mean-
ing of &apos;on&apos; allows the reference object to be a
surface or a line and, while a bus is sometimes
conceptualized as a surface, it is never concep-
tualized as a line.
The second step discards even more concep-
tual representations, this time based on the
type and/or properties of the located object.
In sentence (6), no conceptual representation
is discarded at this point. This is so because
the only condition on the located object is that
it can be supported by the reference object,
and this condition is verified for (6) because a
human being can be supported by a bus. In
sentence (7), however, the conceptual repre-
sentations of a bus as a surface are discarded
because an elephant cannot be supported by
a bus.
The second step also builds the objective
meaning of the sentence. The objective mean-
ing of a sentence is derived from the concep-
tual representation chosen in the first step of
this phase. Its main component is the proper-
ties field. This properties field has the same
type of content as the properties field of the
conceptual representations. It is this shared
field that allows a matching between the En-
glish conceptual representation and an objec-
tive meaning.
In certain cases, in this step, several objec-
tive meanings can be derived. In these cases,
the sentence is ambiguous (see section 5).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990222">
4.2.3 Derivation of the target-
language preposition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901875">
This phase has, once again, two steps. The
first consists of matching the objective mean-
ing of the sentence to a French conceptual-
ization. This can be done in a way similar
to that of the previous step: by matching the
properties field of the objective meaning of the
sentence with the properties field of the French
conceptual representation of the reference ob-
ject.
The second step consists of matching a
French preposition to the French conceptual
representation derived by the previous step.
This is done in a straight-forward way, using
a look-up table. In example (6), the French
conceptualization is matched to the preposi-
tion &apos;dans&apos;.

4.2.4 Finalization

<bodyText confidence="0.999942">
The Finalization phase consists of only one
step: that of generating the French sentence.
In example (6), it is at this point that the
French version, &amp;quot;Notre professeur est dans le

4.3 Coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929">
We implemented the system on a large num-
ber of cases, where each case is an &amp;quot;objective
situation&amp;quot;, such as an object being on a hori-
zontal support or an object being in a closed
environment. There are 35 cases, which can
be divided into the following three categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9557924">
• Specific, i.e., cases in which the ref-
erence object is a given object; the
expressions &apos;on the wall&apos; (meaning
against the wall), &apos;at sea&apos;, and &apos;in the
air&apos; are the specific cases in the system.
• Semi-general, i.e., cases in which the
reference object belongs to a well de-
fined category of objects. Examples are
being in a country (e.g., &apos;in England&apos;
and &apos;in France&apos;) and being in a piece
of clothing (e.g., &apos;in a hat&apos;, &apos;in a shirt&apos;,
and &apos;in a pair of shorts&apos;).
• General, i.e., cases in which the refer-
ence object belongs to an abstract cat-
egory of objects. Examples are being

<bodyText confidence="0.966280454545454">
on a planar surface (e.g., &apos;on the table&apos;,
&apos;on the floor&apos;, &apos;on the chair&apos;, and &apos;on the
roof&apos;) and being at an artifact with a
given purpose (e.g., &apos;at the door&apos;, &apos;at
his books&apos;, &apos;at his desk&apos;, and &apos;at his
typewriter&apos;).
bNote that we are not taking ambiguity into con-
sideration here. If we were, then the sentence &amp;quot;Notre

5 Error and Ambiguity
Detection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999633833333333">
The conceptual representations that were de-
signed for the purpose of translation can also
be used to detect certain kinds of errors and
ambiguities. Below, we describe two kinds
that can be detected by the system: concep-
tual errors and conceptual ambiguity.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979313">
5.1 Conceptual errors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999035333333333">
The system can detect two types of conceptual
errors: conceptualization errors and usage er-
rors or abnormalities.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.864086">
5.1.1 Conceptualization errors
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996274">
Conceptualization errors occur when the
preposition requires the reference object to be
conceptualized in a way that it cannot be in
the language considered. An example of a sen-
tence where such an error occurs is
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.643143">
(11) * The boy is at the shade.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780444444445">
This sentence is erroneous because &apos;at&apos; re-
quires &apos;shade&apos; to be conceptualized as a point,
but &apos;shade&apos; used as a reference object can
never be conceptualized as a point in English.
This error can be detected by the system be-
cause no conceptual representation of shade as
a reference object is built whose conceptual-
ization is point. This error is detected in the
first step of the second phase of the system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.559725">
5.1.2 Usage errors and abnormalities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860571428571">
Usage errors and abnormalities occur when
the demands of the preposition are satisfied
by the reference object, but the conditions re-
quired of the located object by the conceptual
representation, or general conditions required
of all types of relations, are not. Such an error
occurs in the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.482165">
(12) * The man is in the board.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998423909090909">
The use of &apos;in&apos; is fine, considering just the ref-
erence object; for example, a nail can be lo-
cated in a board. The problem is that the
located object is &apos;man&apos;, and a man cannot be
embedded in a board under normal circum-
stances. This error is detected by the system
because the condition on the located object
(in the conditional part of the conceptual rep-
resentation) is not verified. This error is de-
tected in the second step of the second phase
of the system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998871">
5.2 Conceptual ambiguities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999714333333333">
Conceptual ambiguity is ambiguity where the
English preposition has several meanings in
French. The system can detect two types of
conceptual ambiguities: simple and complex.
Both are detected during the first step of the
second phase of the system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.603332">
5.2.1 Simple conceptual ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967771285714286">
In the case of simple conceptual ambiguity, an
ambiguous English preposition is translated
into a single French preposition that is am-
biguous in the same way. For example:
(13) The boy is at the supermarket.
Sentence (13) can be understood to mean ei-
ther that the boy is shopping at the supermar-
ket, or that he is on a trajectory going by the
supermarket, and is currently located at the
supermarket. Its French translation is
(14) Le garcon est au supermarche,
which carries the same ambiguity as the En-
glish sentence. This type of ambiguity is de-
tected when several English conceptual rep-
resentations can be instantiated for a single
sentence. All instantiated English concep-
tual representations have identical descriptive
parts. In the case of simple conceptual am-
biguity, all the French conceptual represen-
tations happen to have the same descriptive
part.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.58745">
5.2.2 Complex conceptual ambiguity
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998848444444445">
The difference between simple and complex
conceptual ambiguity is the following: in the
former, the French sentence carries the same
ambiguity as the English sentence, but in the
latter, the ambiguity is not carried through
the translation (so the English sentence has
two different French translations). Complex
conceptual ambiguity is present in (6), which
is repeated here as sentence (15):
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995328">
159
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9325995">
(15) Our professor is on the bus.
As discussed earlier, this sentence is ambigu-
ous in that the professor could be riding the
bus, or he could be located on the roof of
the bus. This sentence is translated into two
French sentences, one for each case: 6
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.540819">
(16) Notre professeur est dans le bus.
(17) Notre professeur est stir le bus.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981285714286">
In (16), the professor is riding the bus, while
in (17), he is located on the roof of the bus.
This type of ambiguity is detected in the same
way as simple conceptual ambiguity, the only
difference being that in the complex case, all
the French conceptual representations do not
have the same descriptive parts.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999076">
In this paper, we have described a system of
translation for locative prepositions that uses
Herskovits&apos; idea of the ideal meaning of prepo-
sitions and Lakoff&apos;s idea of ICM&apos;s. While our
work does not prove the linguistic and psycho-
logical theories on which it is based, it suggests
that they can be useful in machine transla-
tion. We chose to use conceptual knowledge
to deal with the translation of locative prepo-
sitions, first, because it provides an elegant so-
lution to the problem, and second, because we
believe that conceptual knowledge of the sort
that we use could be useful in other cognitive
tasks such as story understanding, vision, and
robot planning.
