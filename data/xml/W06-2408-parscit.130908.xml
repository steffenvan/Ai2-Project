This paper describes automatic treatment
of multi-word expressions in a
morphologically complex flective
language – Estonian. It focuses on a
special type of multi-word expressions –
the verbal multi-word expressions that
can function as predicates. Authors
describe two language resources – a
database of verbal multi-word
expressions and a corpus where these
items have been annotated manually. The
analysis of the annotated corpus
demonstrates that the Estonian verbal
multi-word expressions alternate in
several grammatical categories. Different
types of the verbal multi-word
expressions (opaque and transparent
idioms, support verb constructions and
collocations) behave differently in the
corpus with regard to the freedom of
alternation. The paper describes main
types of these alternations and the
methods for dealing with them
automatically.

<bodyText confidence="0.999979631578947">
This paper deals with verbal multiword
expressions (VMWE) in real texts of a highly
inflectional language – Estonian. The main
emphasis is on the morphological and syntactic
variability of such constructions with some
implications and recommendations for their
automatic treatment. Once we have a lexicon of
VMWEs, large enough to be used in real-life
applications (to help with morphological
disambiguation, syntactic analysis, machine
translation etc.), we need to devise algorithms to
actually use them. This in turn requires
knowledge about the behavior of VMWEs in real
texts.
Estonian language belongs to the Finnic
group of the Finno-Ugric language family.
Typologically Estonian is an agglutinating
language but more fusional and analytic than the
languages belonging to the northern branch of
the Finnic languages. The word order is
relatively free. One can find a detailed
description of the grammatical system of
Estonian in (Erelt 2003).
In this paper we will focus on a special
type of Estonian multi-word expressions, namely
those that can function as a predicate in a clause.
This paper is organized as follows. In
section 2 we give a brief overview of the
VMWEs in Estonian. Section 3 describes the
database of the VMWEs and the corpus, where
the VMWEs have been manually annotated.
Here we will also present the statistics of the
VMWEs in the corpus. In section 4 we discuss
the variability of these expressions as registered
in our corpus and the consequences of these
variations for the automatic treatment of the
VMWEs. And finally we will make our
conclusions in section 5.

A VMWE consists of a verb and 1) a particle or
2) a nominal phrase (usually, but not always,
consisting of one noun) in more or less frozen
inflectional form, or 3) a non-finite form of a
verb. This last combination – verb plus a non-
finite verb – remains outside the scope of this
paper.

The first combination results in a particle
verb. The particle can express location or
direction (1), perfectivity (2) etc.

The combinations of a verb and a
nominal phrase can be divided into three groups
depending on how the components form the
meaning of the expression: 1) idiomatic
expressions; 2) support verb constructions; 3)
collocations.
Idiomatic expressions are usually
defined as word combinations, the meaning of
which is not the sum or combination of the
meanings of its parts. It is meaningful to
distinguish between opaque (e.g. English idiom
kick the bucket) and transparent idioms (e.g.
English pull strings) as they allow different
degrees of internal variability.
Support verb constructions, sometimes
also called light verb constructions, are
combinations of a verb and its object or, rarely,
some other argument, where the nominal
component denotes an action of some kind and
the verb is semantically empty in this context,
e.g. English make a speech, take a walk.
The collocations are the fuzziest
category. They can be described as VMWEs that
do not fit in the previous categories, but still, for
some reason, have often been included in
dictionaries or are statistically significant
combinations of a verb and its argument(s) in the
corpus.
In all three groups the non-verbal
component is a nominal phrase (not a particle); it

3.1 Database of VMWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823">
Prior to the corpus tagging experiment, a
database of Estonian VMWEs (DB) had been
compiled, with the aim of creating a
comprehensive resource of VMWEs, consisting
of 12,200 entries. First, it contained VMWEs
from six human-created dictionaries: the
Explanatory Dictionary of Estonian (EKSS,
1988-2000), Index of the Thesaurus of Estonian
(Saareste, 1979), a list of particle verbs
(Hasselblatt, 1990), Dictionary of Phrases (Õim,
1991), Dictionary of Synonyms (Õim, 1993) and
the Filosoft thesaurus (http://www.filosoft.ee/
thes_et/). In addition, the database had been
enriched with VMWEs, extracted semi-
automatically from corpora totaling 20 million
words, and missing from any of the
aforementioned human-made dictionaries. This
collocation extraction experiment is described in
(Kaalep, Muischnek 2003).

We have a corpus where all the VMWEs have
been tagged (by hand). Table 1 shows the

The fiction texts are 2000-word excerpts
from Estonian authors from 1980ies. The press
files represent various Estonian newspapers
(nation-wide and local, dailies and weeklies,
quality and tabloid press) from 1995-1999.
Popular science comes from the journal
„Horisont“, from 1996-2003.
Before tagging the VMWEs, the corpus
had been morphologically analyzed and
manually disambiguated (Kaalep, Muischnek
2005), making it possible to pre-process the text
automatically by tagging the candidate VMWEs
in the texts, according to what VMWEs were
present in a database of VMWEs. It was then the
task of a human annotator to select the right
VMWEs, and occasionally to tag new VMWEs,
missing from the database and thus having not
been tagged automatically. The tagged version
was checked by another person, in order to
minimize accidental mistakes.
Table 1 shows that the amount and
proportion of VMWEs depends on the text class.
Table 2 serves to compare the lexicon of
VMWEs based on the corpus with the entries of
the DB (the VMWEs from the corpus have been
converted to the base form they have in the DB).

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997335483871">
First, from rows A, B and D we see that
the intersection of the DB and the corpus lexicon
is surprisingly small.
The small proportion of VMWEs of the
DB that can be found in real texts (compare row
B with row A) may be first explained by the
small size of the corpus. The second reason is
that the human-oriented dictionaries that were
used when building the DB implicitly aimed at
showing the phraseological richness of the
language and thus contained a lot of idiomatic
expressions well known to be rare in real-life
texts.
The fact that so many VMWEs were
missing from the DB was a surprise (compare
row D with row A), because, as mentioned
earlier, the DB had been enriched with VMWEs
from real texts in order to be comprehensive. At
the moment, it is not clear what the exact reason
is.
The size of hapax legomena of new
VMWEs also deserves some explanation
(compare rows B and C versus D and E).
From the literature, one may find a
number of MWU or collocation extraction
experiments from a corpus that show that the
extraction method yields many items, missing
from the available pre-compiled lexicons. Some
of the items may be false hits, but the authors
(whose aim has been to present good extraction
methods) tend to claim that a large number of
those should be added to the lexicon.
(Evert 2005) lists a number of authors,
who have found that lexical resources (machine
readable or paper dictionaries, including
terminological resources) are not suitable for
serving as a gold standard for the set of MWUs
(for a given language or domain). According to
(Evert 2005), manual annotation of MWUs in a
corpus would be more trustworthy, if one wants
to compare the findings of a human (the gold
standard) with those of a collocation extraction
algorithm.
In lexicography, we may find a slightly
conflicting view: not everything found in real
texts deserves to be included in a dictionary.
Producing a text is a creative process, sometimes
resulting in ad hoc neologisms and MWUs that
are never picked up and re-used after the final
full stop of the text they were born in.
Unfortunately these two conflicting
views mean that there is no general, simple
solution for the problem of finding a gold
standard for automatic treatment (extraction or
tagging) of MWUs. It is normal that there is a
discrepancy between a stand-alone lexicon and
the vocabulary of a text.
We believe that the surprisingly high
proportion of hapax legomena in the set of newly
found VMWEs manifests this normal
discrepancy of a precompiled lexicon and a text
corpus, in our case.

4 Behavior of the VMWEs in the corpus
and the problems of their automatic
analysis
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994289">
4.1 Particle verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916808633333333">
There are two main problems encountered in the
automatic identification of the particle verbs.
First, as shown in (6-7), the order of the
components may vary, and the verb and the
particle need not be adjacent to each other,
behaving much like particle verbs in German.
This varying order and disjuncture of the
components is actually characteristic for all the
Estonian VMWEs in the text.
(6)Ma vaatan need paberid
homseks üle.
I look these papers
tomorrow-TR over(particle).
‘I shall look over those
papers by tomorrow.’
(7)Kui sa need paberid
üle vaatad, siis on
kõik valmis
If you these papers
over(particle) look then is
everything ready
‘Once you have looked over
those papers, we will be
done.’
The second main problem is that most of
the particles are homonymous with pre- or
postpositions (Estonian has both of them),
creating a disambiguation problem, similar to the
one concerning the English word over in the
following examples.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9942394">
(8) He looked over the
papers in less than 10
minutes.
(9) He looked over the fence
and saw his neighbor.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98797636">
Just like in English examples the word-
forms look and over form a phrasal verb look
over in example (8), but don’t belong together in
the same way in example (9), the Estonian verb
vaatama ‘to look’ and adverb üle ‘over’ form a
particle verb in the examples (6) and (7), but not
in the following example, where üle is a
preposition:
(10) Ta vaatas üle aia
ja nägi oma naabrit.
s/he looked over fence-GEN
and saw own neighbor-PART
‘S/he looked over the fence
and saw his/her neighbor.’
As a pre- or postposition has to be
adjacent to the noun phrase that is the constituent
of the adpositional phrase, they are usually easier
to detect. In (11), however, the invariable word
üle, that can function both as a particle and a
preposition, is positioned before the noun jõu
‘force’ in genitive, as if üle were a preposition in
prepositional phrase üle jõu ‘exceeding
capabilities’. Actually, it functions as a particle
in this clause, forming a particle verb läks üle
‘went over’.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.799924">
(11) Meelitustelt läks ta
üle jõu kasutamisele.

over force-GEN utilization-
ALL
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988425034482758">
‘S/he switched from
flattery to violence’
Many of these invariable words that can
function either as particles or as pre- and
postpositions are quite frequent in the texts. The
most frequent simplex verbs are also the most
frequent verbal components, forming various
VMWEs. The sentences of the written language
tend to consist of several clauses. All this results
in sentences like (12), where the possible
components of particle verbs are scattered across
several clauses. In this sentence there are four
possible candidate particle verbs: üle jääma ‘to
have no choice but, lit. remain over’, üle tegema
‘to redo, lit. do over’, ära jääma ‘be canceled, lit.
remain away’, ära tegema ‘to accomplish, lit. do
away’
(12) Tal ei jää muud
üle, kui töö ise ära teha.
S/he-ALL not remain else
over(particle)than work-GEN
self away(particle) do-INF
‘S/he has no choice but to
accomplish the work by
her/himself.’
Our preprocessor took only sentence
boundaries into account and that resulted in
serious overgeneration of possible particle verbs.
After experimental tagging of clause boundaries
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996501">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.988095666666667">
in the texts, the precision of pre-processor
improved from 40% to 74% while tagging the
particle verbs.
For other types of VMWEs the clause
boundaries detection is not so essential. The
nominal components of opaque idioms are not so
frequent. Some transparent idioms, all support
verb constructions and collocations can stretch
across clause boundaries, like in (13).
(13) Kõne, mille president
pidas, on mõjutanud meie
välispoliitikat.
Speech that-GEN president
held is influenced our
foreign-policy-PART
‘The speech held by the
president has influenced our
foreign policy.’

4.2 VMWEs consisting of a verb and a
nominal component
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942918032787">
In section 2 we differentiated between three
types of VMWEs consisting of a verb and a
nominal component, namely idioms, support
verb constructions and collocations. All these
constructions show considerable variability in
the manually annotated corpus. Differently from
English, there are no special restrictions on the
morphological or syntactic behavior of the verb
that is part of an idiom. A VP-idiom, for example
the opaque idiom jalga laskma ‘to run off, lit. to
shoot the foot’ combines freely with all the
morphological categories relevant for the verb,
including person, number, tense, mood, non-
finite forms and (impersonal) passive. (The latter
differs from the English passive - it can be
formed from all verbs, having a possible human
agent.) The other types of VMWEs – support
verb constructions and collocations – have also
no restrictions with respect to the verbal
inflection.
In this section we will concentrate on the
variability of the nominal components of
VMWEs – their case and number alternations as
registered in the corpus. The case alternation is
relevant only for the nominal components that
are syntactically in the object position. Our
interest in case alternation is motivated by
observation that multiword units generally and
cross-linguistically tend to be frozen in form.
The less variability there is in form, the easier the
computational treatment is. We may also draw an
analogy between simplex words and multiword
units as items in a lexicon. For an inflectional
language, every word has an inflectional
paradigm, and words with similar paradigms
form an inflectional type or class. Variability of
VMWEs can be analyzed from the same
viewpoint.
From these three types of VMWEs the
variation of idioms has received most attention in
the literature. Idioms have been regarded as units
that can not be given a compositional analysis
(e.g. Katz 1973 among others). This view has
been opposed later (e.g. Nunberg et. al. 1994).
Riehemann (2001) has pointed out that English
idioms show considerable variability in text
corpora. Describing the automatic treatment of
multiword expressions in Basque, Alegria et.al.
(2004) show that the support verb constructions
in Basque can have significant morphosyntactic
variability, including modification of the noun
and case alternation. Similar phenomenon
(number and case alternation) in Turkish is
described in (Oflazer et. al. 2004).
In the following subsections we will
briefly describe the phenomenon of the case
alternation of the object in Estonian and then
discuss the variation of the nominal component
of idioms and support verb constructions. Then
we will describe the number alternations of the
nominal components.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9185">
4.3 The case alternation of the object in
Estonian
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997544045454545">
A VMWE often consists of a verb and a noun
phrase that is its object syntactically. A few
words should be said about the case alternation
of the object in Estonian in general (cf also Erelt
2003: 96-97). Three case forms are possible for
the object – in singular the object can be either in
nominative, genitive or partitive; in plural it can
be either in nominative or in partitive. Often the
nominative and genitive forms are grouped
together under the label ‚total object’.
Partitive is the unmarked form of the
object. The partial object, as it is often called,
alternates with the total object only in the
affirmative clause. In the negative clause only
partial object can be used. In the affirmative
clause the total object is used only if it denotes
definite quantity (is quantitatively bounded) and
the clause expresses perfective activity. So, in
Estonian, the case alternation of the object is
used to express the aspect of the clause – total
object can be used if the action described in the
clause is perfective:

Man built summer-
house-GEN
‘The man built a summer-
house.’ (perfective

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.968456222222222">
In idioms and support verb constructions
the nominal component is only formally or
syntactically the object of the verb, semantically
it is a part of the predicate. So, it would not be
surprising, if such objects wouldn’t undergo the
case alternations characteristic of the object and
would be frozen into the partitive as the
unmarked case for the object. Indeed – that is
true for the opaque idioms. But for transparent
idioms and support verb constructions this is not
the case – our corpus data shows that their
nominal components can alternate between the
forms of total and partial object.
Ca 25% of the transparent idioms in our
corpus have their nominal components in the
case of the total object:
(16) Esinemisele pani punkti
ilutulestik.
Show-ALL put full-stop-
GEN firework
‘The fireworks put an end
to the show.’
In the previous example (16) the
transparent idiom with the nominal component in
the form of the total object was used to describe
a perfective action. But the transparent idioms do
not form a homogenous group with respect to the
case alternation of the nominal component. Some
of them behave like regular verb-object
combinations; others show irregular variation;
and the nominal components of many of them
are frozen in the partitive case.
In support verb constructions the case
alternation of the object is regularly used to
express the aspect of the clause, although the
noun denoting an action is non-referential.

<bodyText confidence="0.95534247368421">
Some support verb constructions are
generally used to refer to the imperfective aspect,
to emphasize the process of the action (atelic
action), not its result. Such expressions are e.g.
tööd tegema ‘to work, lit. do work-PART’ or sõda
pidama ‘fight a war, lit. hold a war-PART’. But,
while the nominal component is modified with
an appropriate attribute, it can also be in the case
of the total object and the support verb
expression as a whole then refers to a perfective
event:

The nominal component of an opaque idiom in
the corpus was always in the same number
(singular or plural) as its base form in the DB.
For the transparent idioms, the picture was
clearly different. Although the nominal
component of many transparent idioms does not
alternate between singular and plural, there are
exceptions, and 14% of the nominal components
in the object position and 4% in some other
position were in plural.
Support verb constructions, in turn,
make extensive use of the number alternations of
the nominal component, whereas the plural form

4.5 The conclusions for the automatic
analysis of VMWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.894562685714286">
The conclusions of the corpus findings for the
automatic detection of the VMWEs are the
following:
1) The free word order requires that, while
detecting automatically the particle verbs in a
text, we should be limited with a clause as
possible context for the co-occurrences. Using
the whole sentence as the possible context would
create too much noise, so the detection of clause
boundaries is a must.
2) We can treat opaque idioms much like the
particle verbs – multi-word units consisting of an
inflecting verb and a frozen nominal component
that don’t cross the clause boundaries.
3) Transparent idioms in the database have to be
divided into those enabling their nominal
component to appear in the cases of the total
object and those, which nominal component is
always in partitive. But can the annotator rely on
her/his intuition while making such decisions?
Rather not, but carrying out corpus research
separately on each item is a time-consuming
task. It could be a better solution for the
transparent idioms to generate all the case forms
possible for the object, as the nouns that are part
of the idioms are not as frequent as the non-
inflecting words that may be particles as well as
pre- and postpositions.
4) The nominal component of the support verb
constructions can under certain circumstances
always be in the form of total object. The nouns
denoting action in support verb constructions can
also be pluralized. So the best solution for them
is to generate all forms of the object, both in
singular and in plural, in the database.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999481363636364">
In this paper we have investigated a subtype of
multiword expressions, namely verbal multi-
word expressions in a flective language –
Estonian.
We have described two linguistic
resources – a database of VMWEs and a corpus
that has been manually annotated for VMWEs.
These expressions exhibit considerable
variation in the corpus. The verb of a VMWE
can combine with all the grammatical categories
relevant for the verb. The nominal component of
a VMWE can alternate in number and case.
However, the nominal components of the
different types of VMWEs (opaque and
transparent idioms, support verb constructions
and collocations) have different degrees of
freedom.
For a morphologically rich flective
language, like Estonian, previous morphological
analysis and disambiguation prior to the
detecting of the multi-word units in a text is
essential.

<abstract confidence="0.99836468">This paper describes automatic treatment of multi-word expressions in a morphologically complex flective language – Estonian. It focuses on a special type of multi-word expressions – the verbal multi-word expressions that can function as predicates. Authors describe two language resources – a database of verbal multi-word expressions and a corpus where these items have been annotated manually. The analysis of the annotated corpus demonstrates that the Estonian verbal multi-word expressions alternate in several grammatical categories. Different types of the verbal multi-word expressions (opaque and transparent idioms, support verb constructions and collocations) behave differently in the corpus with regard to the freedom of alternation. The paper describes main types of these alternations and the methods for dealing with them automatically.</abstract>

The size of hapax legomena of new VMWEs also deserves some explanation (compare rows B and C versus D and E). From the literature, one may find a number of MWU or collocation extraction experiments from a corpus that show that the extraction method yields many items, missing from the available pre-compiled lexicons. Some of the items may be false hits, but the authors (whose aim has been to present good extraction methods) tend to claim that a large number of those should be added to the lexicon. (Evert 2005) lists a number of authors, who have found that lexical resources (machine readable or paper dictionaries, including terminological resources) are not suitable for serving as a gold standard for the set of MWUs (for a given language or domain). According to (Evert 2005), manual annotation of MWUs in a corpus would be more trustworthy, if one wants to compare the findings of a human (the gold standard) with those of a collocation extraction algorithm. In lexicography, we may find a slightly conflicting view: not everything found in real texts deserves to be included in a dictionary. Producing a</context>

The less variability there is in form, the easier the computational treatment is. We may also draw an analogy between simplex words and multiword units as items in a lexicon.

Variability of VMWEs can be analyzed from the same viewpoint. From these three types of VMWEs the variation of idioms has received most attention in the literature. Idioms have been regarded as units that can not be given a compositional analysis (e.g. Katz 1973 among others). This view has been opposed later (e.g. Nunberg et. al. 1994). Riehemann (2001) has pointed out that English idioms show considerable variability in text corpora. Describing the automatic treatment of multiword expressions in Basque, Alegria et.al.
