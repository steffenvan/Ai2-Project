<bodyText confidence="0.999942588235294">
Recent work on automatically predicting the predominant sense of a word
has proven to be promising (McCarthy et al., 2004). It can be applied (as a
first sense heuristic) to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks, without
needing expensive hand-annotated data sets. Due to the big skew in the
sense distribution of many words (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002), the First
Sense heuristic for WSD is often hard to beat. However, the local context
of an ambiguous word can give important clues to which of its senses was
intended. The sense ranking method proposed by McCarthy et al. (2004)
uses a distributional similarity thesaurus. The k nearest neighbours in the
thesaurus are used to establish the predominant sense of a word. In this
paper we report on a first investigation on how to use the grammatical
relations the target word is involved with, in order to select a subset of
the neighbours from the automatically created thesaurus, to take the local
context into account. This unsupervised method is quantitatively evalu-
ated on SemCor. We found a slight improvement in precision over using
the predicted first sense. Finally, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of
the method and suggest ways to improve the results in the future.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995322885714286">
In recent years, a lot of research was done on establishing the predominant sense of
ambiguous words automatically using untagged texts (McCarthy et al., 2004, 2007).
The motivation for that work is twofold: on the one hand it builds on the strength
of the first sense heuristic in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (i.e. the heuristic of
choosing the most commonly used sense of a word, irrespective of the context in which
the word occurs) and on the other hand it recognizes that manually created resources
for establishing word sense distributions are expensive to create and therefore hard
to find. The one resource that is used most widely, SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), is
only available for English and only representative for ’general’ (non domain specific)
text. McCarthy et al’s method was successfully applied to a corpus of modern English
text (the BNC (Leech, 1992)) and the predicted predominant senses compared well
with the gold standard given by SemCor. Other experiments showed that the method
can successfully be adapted to domain specific text (Koeling et al., 2005) and other
languages (for example, Japanese (Iida et al., 2008)).
Even though the first sense heuristic is powerful, it would be preferable to only
use it for WSD, when either the sense distribution is so skewed that the most com-
monly used sense is by far the most dominant, or as a back-off when few other clues
are available to decide otherwise. The use of local context is ultimately necessary to
find evidence for the intended sense of an ambiguous word. In this paper we inves-
tigate how we can exploit results from intermediate steps taken when calculating the
predominant senses to this end.
The work on automatically finding predominant senses1 was partly inspired by the
observation that you can identify word senses by looking at the nearest neighbours of a
target word in a distributional thesaurus. For example, consider the following (simpli-
fied) entry for the word plant in such a thesaurus (omitting the scores for distributional
similarity):
(9) plant : factory, industry, facility, business, company, species, tree, crop, en-
gine, flower, farm, leaf, market, garden, field, seed, shrub...
Just by looking at the neighbours you can identify two main groups of neighbours,
each pointing at separate senses of the word. First there is the set of words consist-
ing of factory, industry, facility, business, company, engine that hint at the ’industrial
plant’ sense of the word and then there is the set consisting of tree, crop, flower, leaf,
species, garden, field, seed, shrub that are more closely related to the ’flora’ sense of
the word. A few words, like farm and possibly market could be associated equally
strongly with either sense. The idea behind ’sense ranking’ is, that the right mix of

1McCarthy et al. (2004) concentrates on evaluating the predominant sense, but the method does in fact
rank all the senses in order of frequency of use.

3. the strength of the distributional similarity of the contributing neighbour and the
target word, will allow us to estimate the relative importance (i.e. frequency of
use) of each sense.
What we want to explore here, is how we can use the local context of an occurrence
of the target word, to select a subset of these neighbours. This subset should consist
of words that are related more strongly to the sense of the word in the target sentence.
For example, consider the word plant in a sentence like:
(10) The gardener grows plants from vegetable seeds.
Plant is used in this sentence as the ’subject of grow’. A simple way of zooming
in on potentially relevant neighbours is by using the most informative contexts shared
between neighbours and the word in the target sentence. This is implemented by
selecting just those words that occur in the same grammatical context (i.e. as subject
of the verb ’grow’) in a reference corpus2. If we apply that to the example in 9, we
end up with the following subset: business, industry, species, tree, crop, flower, seed,
shrub. Even though the first two words are still associated with the ’industrial plant’
sense, we can see that the majority of the words in this subset is strongly associated
with the intended sense.
In the next section we first give a quick introduction to the sense ranking algorithm
introduced in McCarthy et al. (2004). Then we explain how we can use the database of
grammatical relations that we used for creating the thesaurus, for selecting a subset of
neighbours in the thesaurus. The following section describes an evaluation performed
on the SemCor data. In the last two sections we discuss the results and especially
why both recall and precision are lower than we had hoped and what can be done to
improve the results.

For a full review of McCarthy et al’s ranking method, we refer to McCarthy et al.
(2004) or McCarthy et al. (2007). Here we give a short description of the method.
Since we need the grammatical relations used for building the thesaurus, for selecting
a subset of the neighbours, we explain the procedure for building the thesaurus in 2.2.
In the last part of this section we explain how we exploit local context for SD.

2.1 Finding Predominant Senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9816768">
We use the method described in McCarthy et al. (2004) for finding predominant senses
from raw text. It can be applied to all parts of speech, but the experiments in this pa-
per all focus on nouns only. The method uses a thesaurus obtained from the text by
parsing, extracting grammatical relations and then listing each word (w) with its top k
nearest neighbours, where k is a constant. Like McCarthy et al. (2004) we use k = 50
and obtain our thesaurus using the distributional similarity metric described by Lin
(1998). We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory. The senses of a word w are
each assigned a ranking score which sums over the distributional similarity scores of

experiments).

the neighbours and weights each neighbour’s score by a WN Similarity score (Pat-
wardhan and Pedersen, 2003) between the sense of w and the sense of the neighbour
that maximises the WN Similarity score. This weight is normalised by the sum of
such WN similarity scores between all senses of w and and the senses of the neigh-
bour that maximises this score. We use the WN Similarity jcn score on nouns (Jiang
and Conrath, 1997) since this gave reasonable results for McCarthy et al. and it is
efficient at run time given precompilation of frequency information. The jcn measure
needs word frequency information, which we obtained from the British National Cor-
pus (BNC) (Leech, 1992). The distributional thesaurus was constructed using subject,
direct object adjective modifier and noun modifier relations.
Thus we rank each sense wsi ∈ WSw using Prevalence Score wsi =

2.2 Building the Thesaurus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986214285714">
The thesaurus was acquired using the method described by Lin (1998). For input we
used grammatical relation data extracted using an automatic parser (Briscoe and Car-
roll, 2002). For the experiments in this paper we used the 90 million words of written
English from the BNC. For each noun we considered the co-occurring verbs in the
direct object and subject relation, the modifying nouns in noun-noun relations and the
modifying adjectives in adjective-noun relations. This limited set of grammatical rela-
tions was chosen since accuracy of the parser is particularly high for these 4 relations.
We could easily extend the set of relations to more in the future. A noun, w, is thus de-
scribed by a set of co-occurrence triples &lt; w,r,x &gt; and associated frequencies, where
r is a grammatical relation and x is a possible co-occurrence with w in that relation.
For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10
or more, we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin
(1998). If T(w) is the set of co-occurrence types (r,x) such that I(w,r,x) is positive
then the similarity between two nouns, w and n, can be computed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994736666666667">
Y r ET w nT n (I(w,r,x)+I(n,r,x))

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983015">
A thesaurus entry of size k for a target noun w can then be defined as the k most similar
nouns to noun w.

2.3 Local Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97405215">
The basis for building the distributional similarity thesaurus, is the set of grammatical
relations that the target word shares with other words. For example, if we look at
the thesaurus entry for the noun bike, then we see that the closest neighbours are (the
synonym) bicycle and the closely related motorbike (and motorcycle). The next 10
closest neighbours are all other vehicles (car, van, boat, bus, etc.). This is something
From Predicting Predominant Senses to Local Context for WSD 133
we would expect to see, since all these words do occur in similar grammatical contexts.
We travel by bike, as well as by motorcycle, car and bus. We park them, drive_off
with them, hire them, abandon them and repair them. Many of these relations can be
applied to a wide range of vehicles (or even a wider range of objects). However, some
relations are more specific to two-wheeled vehicles. For example, it is quite common
to mount a bike or a motorbike, whereas it is less common to mount a car or a van.
(Motor)bikes are chained to stop people from stealing them and it is probably more
common to ride a (motor)bike as opposed to driving a car or truck. Of course there
are many other more general things you can do with these vehicles: buy, sell, steal
them; there are yellow bikes, cars and boats, just like other objects. Therefore, we can
see many other types of objects lower in the list of neighbours that share these more
general grammatical relations, but not those that are specific to, say, vehicles or even
the sub-category of two-wheeled vehicles.
Consider the following sentence containing the ambiguous noun body:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9946405">
(13) ’Regular exercise keeps the body healthy.’
(14) ’The funding body approved the final report.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999811071428572">
We would like our algorithm to be able to recognize that Wordnet’s first sense of
the word body (the entire physical structure of an organism (especially an animal or
human being)) is the most appropriate for sentence 13 and the third sense (a group
of persons associated by some common tie or occupation and regarded as an entity)
for sentence 14. If we calculate the most likely sense using all of the first 50 nearest
neighbours in the thesaurus, we predict that sense 4 is the most frequently used sense
(the body excluding the head and neck and limbs).
However, the two uses of the target word in 13 and 14 appear each in a very spe-
cific grammatical context. How can we exploit this local context to single out a certain
subset of the 50 nearest neighbours, containing those words that are particularly rel-
evant for (or more closely related to) the grammatical relation that the target word is
involved in this particular sentence. The idea we pursue here is to look at those neigh-
bours in the thesaurus that occur in the same grammatical relation as our target word
and share a high mutual information (i.e. word and grammatical relation do not only
occur frequently together, but also when you see one, there is a high probability that
you see the other).
While creating the thesaurus we consider all the words that co-occur with a certain
target word (where co-occur means that it appears in the same grammatical relation).
We also calculate the mutual information of both the target word and the co-occurring
word and the grammatical relation. Instead of throwing this information away after
finishing an entry in the thesaurus, we now store this information in the grammatical
relation database.
Since this database grows to enormous proportions (in the order of 200GB for the
one built up while processing the BNC), we need to reduce its size to be able to
work with it. If we only keep those entries in the database that involve the words
in the thesaurus and their 50 neighbours, we can reduce the database to manageable
proportions. We experimented with reducing the number of entries in the database
even further by limiting the number of entries per grammatical relations to the ones

with the highest mutual information scores, but this only had a negative effect on the
recall, without improving the precision. As we will see later, data sparseness is a
serious issue and it is therefore not advisable to cut-out any usable information that
we have at our disposal. The word sense disambiguation procedure that uses the local
context is then straightforward:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898721941176471">
1. Parse the sentence with the target word (the word to be disambiguated).
2. If the target word is not involved with any of the 4 grammatical relations we
considered for building up the thesaurus, local context can not be used.
3. Otherwise, consult the database to retrieve the co-occurring words:
• Let GR be the set of triples &lt; w,r,x &gt; from equation 12 in Section 2.2 for
target word w.
• Let NGR be the set of triples &lt; nj,r,x &gt; from equation 12 for any neigh-
bour nj E Nw
• For all w E T and all top 50 n E Nw, keep entries with &lt; *,r,x &gt; in
database.
• Let SGR be the set of relations &lt; r,x &gt; in the target sentence, where I &lt;
w,r,x &gt; and I &lt; n,r,x &gt; are both positive (i.e. r,x are both in the target
sentence and have high MI in BNC for both w and n.)
4. Compute the ranking score for each sense by applying to a modified version of
the ranking equation (15) (compared to the original given in (11)), where the k
nearest neighbours are replaced by the subset found in the step 3.

The fact that a subset of the neighbours in the thesaurus share some specific relations

Word Sense Disambiguation. Let us have a closer look at the two example sentences

Since keep is a fairly general verb, it is not surprising that quite a few of the neighbours
occur as object of keep. As a matter of fact, 28 of the first 50 neighbours share this
relation. However, the good news is, that pretty much all the words associated with
body-parts (such as arm, hand, leg, face and head) are among them.
The two grammatical relations that body is involved with in sentence 14, are more
specific. There are just 6 neighbours that share the ’subject of approve’ relation with
body and another 5 that are used to modify the noun body. Among these words are the
highly relevant words organisation, institution and board.

3 Evaluation on SemCor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969535714286">
The example in the last section shows that in certain cases the method performs the
way we envisaged. However, we need a quantitative evaluation to get a proper picture
of the method’s usefulness. We performed a full evaluation on SemCor. In this experi-
ment we limited our attention to nouns only. We further eliminated Proper Names and
multi-word units from the test set. Since the nouns in both these categories are mostly
monosemous, they are less interesting as test material and apart from that, they intro-
duce problems (mostly parser related) that have little to do with the proposed method.
A total of 73,918 words were left to evaluate. Table 1 summarizes the results. The fig-
ure for recall for the ’First Sense’ method is not given, because we want to contrast the
local context method with the first sense method. Whilst the first sense method will
return an answer in most cases, the local context method proposed in this paper will
not. Here we want to focus on how we can improve on using the first sense heuristic
by taking local context into account, rather than give complete results for a WSD task.
There are several things to say about these results. First of all, even though the
results for ’local context’ are slightly better than for ’first sense’, we expected more
from it. We had identified quite a few cases like 13 and 14 above, where the local
context seemed to be able to help to identify the right neigbours in order to make
the difference. Below, we will discuss a few cases where the grammatical relations
involved are so general, that the subset of neighbours is large and most importantly,
not discriminative enough. It seems to be reasonable to expect that the latter cases will
not influence the precision too much (i.e. a smaller group of neighbours will often give
a different result, but some better, some worse).
The recall is also lower than expected. The first thought was that data sparseness
was the main problem here, but additional experiments showed us that that is unlike to
be the case. In one experiment we took a part of the GigaWord corpus (Graff, 2003),
similar in size to the written part of the BNC (used in our original experiment) and
built our grammatical relation database using the combined corpus. The recall went
up a little, but at the price of a slightly lower precision.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971942857143">
The main problem causing the low recall seems to be the small number of grammatical
relations that we use for building the thesaurus. The four relations used (verb-subject,
verb-object, noun-noun-modifier and adjective-noun-modifier) were chosen because
of the parsers’ high accuracy for these. For building the thesaurus, these grammatical
relations suffice, since every word will occur in one of these relations sooner or later.
However, whenever in a sentence the target word occurs outside these four relations,
we are not able to look it up in our database. Nouns within prepositional phrases seem
to be a major victim here. It should be straightforward to experiment with including
prepositional phrase related grammatical relations. We will have to evaluate the influ-
ence of the introduced noise on creating the thesaurus. Alternatively, it is possible to
use the four relations as before for creating the thesaurus and store the extra relations
in our database just for look-up.
A second cause for missing target words is parser errors. Even though RASP will
produce partial parses whenever a full parse of a sentence is not available, some loss
is inevitable. This is a harder problem to solve. One way of solving this problem
might be by using a proximity thesaurus instead of a thesaurus build using grammat-
ical relatons. McCarthy et al. (2007) reported promising results for using proximity
based thesaurus for predicting predominant senses, with accuracy figures closely be-
hind those achieved with a dependency based thesaurus.
One plausible reason why the method is not working in many cases, is the fact that
the word to be disambiguated in the target sentence often occurs in a very general
grammatical relation. For example, ’subject of’ or ’direct object of’ a verb like have.
In these cases, most of the neighbors in the thesaurus will be selected. Even though it
is clear that that would minimize the positive effect, it is not immediately obvious that
this would have a negative effect. It might therefore be the case that the number of
cases where the grammatical relation is a good selection criterion, is just lower than
we thought (although this is not the impression that you get when you look at the
data). We will need to establish a way of quantitatively evaluating this.
The Mutual Information score gives us a measure of the dependence between the
grammatical relation and the word (neighbour of the target word) we are interested
it. It gives us a handle on ’generality’ of the combination of seeing both events. This
means that for a very common grammatical relation, many words will be expected to
co-occur with a frequency comparable to their general frequency in texts. The contrast
with relation/word combinations for which this is not the case might be usable for
identifying the cases that we want to exclude here.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987152481481482">
In this paper we propose a completely unsupervised method for Word Sense Disam-
biguation that takes the local context of the target word into account. The starting
point for this method is a method for automatically predicting the predominant senses
of words. The grammatical relations that were used to create the distributional simi-
larity thesaurus is exploited to select a subset of the k neighbours in the thesaurus, to
focus on those neighbours that are used in the same grammatical context as the word
we want to disambiguate in the target sentence.
From Predicting Predominant Senses to Local Context for WSD 137
Even though the precision of our proposed method is slightly higher than for the
predominant sense method, we are disappointed by the current results. We do believe
that there is more mileage to be had from the method we suggest. Improvement of both
recall and precision is on the agenda for future research. As we stated in the previous
section, we believe that the lower than expected recall can be addressed fairly easily,
by considering more grammatical relations. This is straightforward to implement and
results can be expected in the near future.
A second approach, involving a thesaurus built on proximity, rather than grammat-
ical relations will also be investigated. Considering the expected lower precision for
this approach, we plan to use the proximity-based thesaurus as a ’back off’ solution
in case we fail to produce an answer with the dependency-based thesaurus. When
the proximity-based thesaurus is in place, we plan to perform a full evaluation of the
dependency versus the proximity approach.
Before we can deal with improving the local context method’s precision, we need
to have a better idea of the circumstances in which the method gets it wrong. We have
identified a large group of examples, where it is unlikely that the method will be suc-
cessful. A first step will be to develop a method to identify these cases automatically
and eliminate those from the targets that we are attempting to try. In the previous
section, we sketched how we think that we can achieve this by applying a Pointwise
Mutual Information threshold. If we are successful, this will at least give us the op-
portunity to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the method. At the moment, the
virtues of the method seem to be obscured too much by dealing with cases that should
not be considered.
More insight in the method can also be gained from trying to identify in which
situations the method is more likely to get it right. At the moment we haven’t broken
down the results yet in terms of the target word’s polysemy and/or frequency of use.
Some grammatical relations might be more useful for identifying the intended sense
than other. A detailed analysis could give us these insights.
We do believe there is a strong case to be made for using unsupervised methods
for Word Sense Disambiguation (apart from McCarthy et al. (2004)’s predominant
sense method, other approaches include e.g. Basili et al. (2006)). The predominant
sense method has proven to be successful. However, applying the first sense heuristic
should be limited to certain cases. We can think of the cases where the dominance
of the predominant sense is so strong, that there is little to gain from doing a proper
attempt to disambiguation or to the cases where ’everything else fails’. Ultimately,
our goal is to find a balance between the dominance of the predominant sense and the
strength of the evidence from the supporting context. If we are able to recognize the
correct clues from the local context and use these clues to focus on those words with
a high distributional similarity to the target word in the context in which the word is
actually used, we can build on work on predicting predominant senses, to rely less on
the first sense heuristic. This would be a good step forward for unsupervised WSD.

<abstract confidence="0.999660222222222">Recent work on automatically predicting the predominant sense of a word has proven to be promising (McCarthy et al., 2004). It can be applied (as a sense heuristic) to Word Sense Disambiguation tasks, without needing expensive hand-annotated data sets. Due to the big skew in the sense distribution of many words (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002), the First Sense heuristic for WSD is often hard to beat. However, the local context of an ambiguous word can give important clues to which of its senses was intended. The sense ranking method proposed by McCarthy et al. (2004) a distributional similarity thesaurus. The neighbours in the thesaurus are used to establish the predominant sense of a word. In this paper we report on a first investigation on how to use the grammatical relations the target word is involved with, in order to select a subset of the neighbours from the automatically created thesaurus, to take the local context into account. This unsupervised method is quantitatively evaluated on SemCor. We found a slight improvement in precision over using the predicted first sense. Finally, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the method and suggest ways to improve the results in the future.</abstract>

It seems to be reasonable to expect that the latter cases will not influence the precision too much (i.e. a smaller group of neighbours will often give a different result, but some better, some worse). The recall is also lower than expected. The first thought was that data sparseness was the main problem here, but additional experiments showed us that that is unlike to be the case. In one experiment we took a part of the GigaWord corpus (Graff, 2003), similar in size to the written part of the BNC (used in our original experiment) and built our grammatical relation database using the combined corpus. The recall went up a little, but at the price of a slightly lower precision. 136 Koeling and McCarthy 4 Discussion The main problem causing the low recall seems to be the small number of grammatical relations that we use for building the thesaurus.

A few words, like farm and possibly market could be associated equally strongly with either sense. The idea behind ’sense ranking’ is, that the right mix of 1. number of neighbours with a strong associations with one or more of the senses, 2. the strength of the association (semantic similarity) between neighbour and sense and 1McCarthy et al.

This is implemented by selecting just those words that occur in the same grammatical context (i.e. as subject of the verb ’grow’) in a reference corpus2. If we apply that to the example in 9, we end up with the following subset: business, industry, species, tree, crop, flower, seed, shrub. Even though the first two words are still associated with the ’industrial plant’ sense, we can see that the majority of the words in this subset is strongly associated with the intended sense. In the next section we first give a quick introduction to the sense ranking algorithm introduced in McCarthy et al. (2004). Then we explain how we can use the database of grammatical relations that we used for creating the thesaurus, for selecting a subset of neighbours in the thesaurus. The following section describes an evaluation performed on the SemCor data. In the last two sections we discuss the results and especially why both recall and precision are lower than we had hoped and what can be done to improve the results. 2 Predominant Senses and Local Context For a full review of McCarthy et al’s ranking method, we refer to McCarthy et al.

Alternatively, it is possible to use the four relations as before for creating the thesaurus and store the extra relations in our database just for look-up. A second cause for missing target words is parser errors. Even though RASP will produce partial parses whenever a full parse of a sentence is not available, some loss is inevitable. This is a harder problem to solve. One way of solving this problem might be by using a proximity thesaurus instead of a thesaurus build using grammatical relatons. McCarthy et al. (2007) reported promising results for using proximity based thesaurus for predicting predominant senses, with accuracy figures closely behind those achieved with a dependency based thesaurus. One plausible reason why the method is not working in many cases, is the fact that the word to be disambiguated in the target sentence often occurs in a very general grammatical relation. For example, ’subject of’ or ’direct object of’ a verb like have. In these cases, most of the neighbors in the thesaurus will be selected. Even though it is clear that that would minimize the positive effect, it is not immedia</context>

The motivation for that work is twofold: on the one hand it builds on the strength of the first sense heuristic in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (i.e. the heuristic of choosing the most commonly used sense of a word, irrespective of the context in which the word occurs) and on the other hand it recognizes that manually created resources for establishing word sense distributions are expensive to create and therefore hard to find. The one resource that is used most widely, SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), is only available for English and only representative for ’general’ (non domain specific) text. McCarthy et al’s method was successfully applied to a corpus of modern English text (the BNC (Leech, 1992)) and the predicted predominant senses compared well with the gold standard given by SemCor. Other experiments showed that the method can successfully be adapted to domain specific text (Koeling et al., 2005) and other languages (for example, Japanese (Iida et al., 2008)). Even though the first sense heuristic is powerful, it would be preferable to only use it for WSD, when either the sense di</context>

Like McCarthy et al. (2004) we use k = 50 and obtain our thesaurus using the distributional similarity metric described by Lin (1998). We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory. The senses of a word w are each assigned a ranking score which sums over the distributional similarity scores of 2We use the same corpus used for generating the thesaurus as for the reference corpus (in all our experiments). 132 Koeling and McCarthy the neighbours and weights each neighbour’s score by a WN Similarity score (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) between the sense of w and the sense of the neighbour that maximises the WN Similarity score. This weight is normalised by the sum of such WN similarity scores between all senses of w and and the senses of the neighbour that maximises this score. We use the WN Similarity jcn score on nouns (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) since this gave reasonable results for McCarthy et al. and it is efficient at run time given precompilation of frequency information. The jcn measure needs word frequency information, which we obtained from the British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992). The distributional thesaur</context>
