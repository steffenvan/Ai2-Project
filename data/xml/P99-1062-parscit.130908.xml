This paper presents a new method of analyz-
ing Japanese noun phrases of the form N1 no
N2. The Japanese postposition no roughly cor-
responds to of, but it has much broader us-
age. The method exploits a definition of N2
in a dictionary. For example, rugby no coach
can be interpreted as a person who teaches tech-
nique in rugby. We illustrate the effectiveness
of the method by the analysis of 300 test noun
phrases.

The semantic analysis of Japanese noun phrases
of the form N1 no N2 is one of the difficult prob-
lems which cannot be solved by the current ef-
forts of many researchers. Roughly speaking,
Japanese noun phrase N1 no N2 corresponds to
English noun phrase N2 of N1. However, the
Japanese postposition no has much broader us-
age than of as follows:
watashi T no kuruma &apos;car&apos; possession
tsukue &apos;desk&apos; no ashi &apos;leg&apos; whole-part
gray no seihuku &apos;uniform&apos; modification
senmonka &apos;expert&apos; no chousa &apos;study&apos;
agent
rugby no coach subject
yakyu &apos;baseball&apos; no senshu &apos;player&apos;
category
kaze &apos;cold&apos; no virus result
ryokou &apos;travel&apos; no jyunbi &apos;preparation&apos;
purpose
toranpu &apos;card&apos; no tejina &apos;trick&apos; instrument
The conventional approach to this problem
was to classify semantic relations, such as pos-
session, whole-part, modification, and others.
Then, classification rules were crafted by hand,
or detected from relation-tagged examples by
a machine learning technique (Shimazu et al.,
1987; Sumita et al., 1990; Tomiura et al., 1995;
Kurohashi et al., 1998).
The problem in such an approach is to set
up the semantic relations. For example, the
above examples and their classification came
from the IPA nominal dictionary (Information-
Technology Promotion Agency, Japan, 1996).
Is it possible to find clear boundaries among
subject, category, result, purpose, instrument,
and others? No matter how fine-grained rela-
tions we set up, we always encounter phrases
which are on the boundary or belong to two or
more relations.
This paper proposes a completely different
approach to the task, which exploits semantic
role information of nouns in an ordinary dictio-
nary.

2 Semantic Roles of Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980277777778">
The meaning of a word can be recognized by
the relationship with its semantic roles. In the
case of verbs, the arguments of the predicates
constitute the semantic roles, and a consider-
able number of studies have been made. For
example, the case grammar theory is a semantic
valence theory that describes the logical form of
a sentence in terms of a predicate and a series
of case-labeled arguments such as agent, object,
location, source, goal (Fillmore, 1968). Further-
more, a wide-coverage dictionary describing se-
mantic roles of verbs in machine readable form
has been constructed by a great deal of labor
(Ikehara et al., 1997).
Not only verbs, but also nouns can have se-
mantic roles. For example, coach is a coach of
some sport; virus is a virus causing some dis-
ease. Unlike the case of verbs, no semantic-

nobel-sho &apos;Nobel prize&apos; no kisetsu &apos;season&apos;
role dictionary for nouns has been constructed
so far. However, in many cases, semantic roles
of nouns are described in an ordinary dictio-
nary for human being. For example, a Japanese
dictionary for children, Reikai Shougaku Koku-
gojiten (abbreviated to RSK) (Tadika, 1997),
gives the definition of the word coach and virus
as followsl:
coach a person who teaches technique in some
sport
virus a living thing even smaller than bacte-
ria which causes infectious disease like in-
fluenza
If an NLP system can utilize these definitions
as they are, we do not need to take the trou-
ble in constructing a semantic-role dictionary
for nouns in the special format for machine-use.

3 Interpretation of N1 no N2 using a
Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997325666666667">
Semantic-role information of nouns in an ordi-
nary dictionary can be utilized to solve the dif-
ficult problem in the semantic analysis of N1
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9720446">
1 Although our method handles Japanese noun
phrases by using Japanese definition sentences, in this
paper we use their English translations for the explana-
tion. In some sense, the essential point of our method is
language-independent.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997139566666667">
no N2 phrases. In other words, we can say the
problem disappears.
For example, rugby no coach can be inter-
preted by the definition of coach as follows: the
dictionary describes that the noun coach has an
semantic role of sport, and the phrase rugby no
coach specifies that the sport is rugby. That is,
the interpretation of the phrase can be regarded
as matching rugby in the phrase to some sport
in the coach definition. Furthermore, based on
this interpretation, we can paraphrase rugby no
coach into a person who teaches technique in
rugby, by replacing some sport in the definition
with rugby.
Kaze &apos;cold&apos; no virus is also easily interpreted
based on the definition of virus, linking kaze
&apos;cold&apos; to infectious disease.
Such a dictionary-based method can handle
interpretation of most phrases where conven-
tional classification-based analysis failed. As a
result, we can arrange the diversity of N1 no N2
senses simply as in Table 1.
The semantic-role relation is a relation that
N1 fills in an semantic role of N2. When N2 is
an action noun, an object-action relation is also
regarded as a semantic-role relation.
On the other hand, in the agent, posses-
sion and belonging relations, N1 and N2 have
a weaker relationship. In theory, any action can
be done by anyone (my study, his reading, etc.);
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997764">
482
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872620689655">
anything can be possessed by anyone (my pen,
his feeling, etc.); and anyone can belong to any
organization (I belong to a university, he be-
longs to any community, etc.).
The difference between the semantic-role re-
lation and the agent, possession, belonging rela-
tions can correspond to the difference between
the agent and the object of verbs. In general,
the object has a stronger relationship with a
verb than the agent, which leads several asym-
metrical linguistic phenomena.
The time and place relations have much
clearer correspondence to optional cases for
verbs. A modification relation is also parallel
to modifiers for verbs. If a phrase has a modi-
fication relation, it can be paraphrased into N2
is N1, like gray no seihuku &apos;uniform&apos; is para-
phrased into seihuku &apos;uniform&apos; is gray.
The last relation, the complement relation is
the most difficult to interpret. The relation be-
tween N1 and N2 does not come from N1&apos;s se-
mantic roles, or it is not so weak as the other
relations. For example, kimono no jyosei &apos;lady&apos;
means a lady wearing a kimono, and nobel-sho
&apos;Nobel prize&apos; no kisetsu &apos;season&apos; means a sea-
son when the Nobel prizes are awarded. Since
automatic interpretation of the complement re-
lation is much more difficult than that of other
relations, it is beyond the scope of this paper.

4 Analysis Method

<bodyText confidence="0.999926">
Once we can arrange the diversity of N1 no N2
senses as in Table 1, their analysis becomes very
simple, consisting of the following two modules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9980248">
1. Dictionary-based analysis (abbreviated to
DBA hereafter) for semantic-role relations.
2. Semantic feature-based analysis (abbrevi-
ated to SBA hereafter) for some semantic-
role relations and all other relations.

<bodyText confidence="0.9184315">
After briefly introducing resources employed,
we explain the algorithm of the two analyses.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.484981">
4.1 Resources
4.1.1 RSK
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999736684210526">
RSK (Reikai Shougaku Kokugojiten), a
Japanese dictionary for children, is used to find
semantic roles of nouns in DBA. The reason
why we use a dictionary for children is that,
generally speaking, definition sentences of such
a dictionary are described by basic words,
which helps the system finding links between
N1 and a semantic role of a head word.
All definition sentences in RSK were analyzed
by JUMAN, a Japanese morphological analyzer,
and KNP, a Japanese syntactic and case ana-
lyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Kurohashi
and Nagao, 1998). Then, a genus word for a
head word, like a person for coach were detected
in the definition sentences by simple rules: in a
Japanese definition sentence, the last word is a
genus word in almost all cases; if there is a noun
coordination at the end, all of those nouns are
regarded as genus words.

4.1.2 NTT Semantic Feature
Dictionary

<bodyText confidence="0.97350435">
NTT Communication Science Laboratories
(NTT CS Lab) constructed a semantic feature
tree, whose 3,000 nodes are semantic features,
and a nominal dictionary containing about
300,000 nouns, each of which is given one or
more appropriate semantic features. Figure 1
shows the upper levels of the semantic feature
tree.
SBA uses the dictionary to specify conditions
of rules. DBA also uses the dictionary to cal-
culate the similarity between two words. Sup-
pose the word X and Y have a semantic feature
Sx and Sy, respectively, their depth is dx and
dy in the semantic tree, and the depth of their
lowest (most specific) common node is dc, the
similarity between X and Y, sim(X, Y), is cal-
culated as follows:
sim(X, Y) = (dc x 2)1(dx dy).
If Sx and Sy are the same, the similarity is 1.0,

Dictionary based-Analysis (DBA) tries to find
a correspondence between N1 and a semantic
role of N2 by utilizing RSK, by the following
process:

<listItem confidence="0.9860662">
1. Look up N2 in RSK and obtain the defini-

2.3. When w is a verb, it has a vacant case
slot, and the semantic constraint for
the slot meets the semantic feature of
N1, give 0.5 to their correspondence.

<listItem confidence="0.988344">
3. If we could not find a correspondence with
0.6 or more score by the step 2, look up the

sentences of it, and repeat the step 2 again.
(The looking up of a genus word is done
only once.)
4. Finally, if the best correspondence score is
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.876443">
0.5 or more, DBA outputs the best corre-
spondence, which can be a semantic-role
relation of the input; if not, DBA outputs
nothing.
For example, the input rugby no coach is ana-
lyzed as follows (figures attached to words indi-
cate the similarity scores; the underlined score
is the best):

in some sport i.o
Rugby, technique and sport have the semantic
feature SPORT, METHOD and SPORT respectively
in NTT Semantic Feature Dictionary. The low-
est common node between SPORT and METHOD
is ABSTRACT, and based on these semantic fea-
tures, the similarity between rugby and tech-
nique is calculated as 0.21. On the other hand,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995844">

<bodyText confidence="0.935263352941177">
the similarity between rugby and sport is calcu-
lated as 1.0, since they have the same seman-
tic feature. The case analysis finds that all case
slots of teach are filled in the definition sentence.
As a result, DBA outputs the correspondence
between rugby and sport as a possible semantic-
role relation of the input.
On the other hand, bunsho &apos;writings&apos; no tat-

to a vacant case slot of the predicate outstand-

relation, which means analysis failure. When
both DBA and SBA output some relations, the
results are integrated as follows (basically, if the
output of the one analysis is more reliable, the
output of the other analysis is discarded):
If a semantic-role relation is detected by SBA,
discard the output from DBA.
Else if the correspondence of 0.95 or more
score is detected by DBA,
discard the output from SBA.
Else if some relation is detected by SBA,
discard the output from DBA if the corre-
spondence score is 0.8 or less.

We have collected 300 test N1 no N2 phrases
from EDR dictionary (Japan Electronic Dic-

dictionary (Information-Technology Promotion

N2 phrases, paying attention so that they had
enough diversity in their relations. Then, we
analyzed the test phrases by our system, and
checked the analysis results by hand.
Table 2 shows the reasonably good result
both of DBA and SBA. The precision of DBA,
the ratio of correct analyses to detected anal-
yses, was 77% (=137/(137+19+21)); the re-
call of DBA, the ratio of correct analyses
to potential semantic-role relations, was 78%

good, excepting modification relation.
Some phrases were given two or more rela-

one phrase. The ratio that at least one correct
relation was detected was 81% (=242/300); the

Mado &apos;window&apos; no curtain must embarrass
conventional classification-based methods; it
might be place, whole-part, purpose, or some
other relation like being close. However, DBA
can clearly explain the relation. Osetuma &apos;liv-

alyzed phrase. DBA not only interprets it in a
simple sense, but also provides us with more in-
teresting information that a curtain might be
being used for partition in the living room.

The analysis result of oya &apos;parent&apos; no isan

correct analysis, but also additional information
was given by DBA. That is, the analysis result
tells us that the parent died. Such information
would facilitate intelligent peformance in a dia-
logue system analyzing:
User : I bought a brand-new car by the legacy
from my parent.
System : Oh, when did your parent die? I
didn&apos;t know that.
By examining these analysis results, we
can conclude that the dictionary-based un-

much richer information than the conventional

(8) shiire &apos;stocking&apos; no saikaku `resoucefulness&apos;
resoucefulness the ability to use one&apos;s
head cog cleverly
Saikaku &apos;resourcefulness&apos; can be the ability for
some task, but the definition says nothing about
that. On the other hand, the definition of
sainou &apos;talent&apos; is clearer about the semantic role
as shown below. Concequently, shiire &apos;stocking&apos;
no sainou &apos;talent&apos; can be interpretted correctly
by DBA.
(9) shiire &apos;stocking&apos; no sainou &apos;talent&apos;
talent power and skill, esp. to do
something 0.90
This represents an elementary problem of our
method. Out of 175 phrases which should be
interpreted as semantic-role relation based on
the dictionary, 13 were not analyzed correctly
because of this type of problem.
However, such a problem can be solved by
revising the definition sentences, of course in
natural language. This is a humanly reason-
able task, very different from the conventional
approach where the classification should be re-
considered, or the classification rules should be
modified.
Another problem is that sometimes the simi-
larity calculated by NTT semantic feature dic-
tionary is not high enough to correspond as fol-
lows:
(10) ume &apos;time flowers&apos; no meisho &apos;famous place&apos;
famous place a place being famous for
scenery 0.20, etc.
In some cases the structure of NTT semantic
feature dictionary is questionable; in some cases
a definition sentence is too rigid; in other cases
an input phrase is a bit metaphorical.
As for SBA, most relations can be detected
well by simple rules. However, it is not possible
to detect a modification relation accurately only
by using NTT semantic feature dictionary, be-
cause modifier and non-modifier nouns are often
mixed in the same semantic feature category.
Other proper resource should be incorporated;
one possibility is to use the dictionary definition
of N1.

From the view point of semantic roles of nouns,
there have been several related research con-
ducts: the mental space theory is discussing
the functional behavior of nouns (Fauconnier,
1985); the generative lexicon theory accounts
for the problem of creative word senses based
on the qualia structure of a word (Pustejovsky,
1995); Dahl et al. (1987) and Macleod et al.
(1997) discussed the treatment of nominaliza-
tions. Compared with these studies, the point
of this paper is that an ordinary dictionary can
be a useful resource of semantic roles of nouns.
Our approach using an ordinary dictionary
is similar to the approach used to creat Mind-
Net (Richardson et al., 1998). However, the se-
manitc analysis of noun phrases is a much more
specialized and suitable application of utilizing
dictionary entries.

The paper proposed a method of analyzing
Japanese N1 no N2 phrases based on a dictio-
nary, interpreting obscure phrases very clearly.
The method can be applied to the analysis of
compound nouns, like baseball player. Roughly
speaking, the semantic diversity in compound
nouns is a subset of that in N1 no N2 phrases.
Furthermore, the method must be applicable to

In the case of verbs, the arguments of the predicates constitute the semantic roles, and a considerable number of studies have been made. For example, the case grammar theory is a semantic valence theory that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a predicate and a series of case-labeled arguments such as agent, object, location, source, goal (Fillmore, 1968). Furthermore, a wide-coverage dictionary describing semantic roles of verbs in machine readable form has been constructed by a great deal of labor (Ikehara et al., 1997). Not only verbs, but also nouns can have semantic roles. For example, coach is a coach of some sport; virus is a virus causing some disease. Unlike the case of verbs, no semantic481 Table 1: Semantic relations in N1 no N2 Relation Noun Phrase N1 no N2 Verb Phrase Semantic-role rugby no coach, kaze &apos;cold&apos; no virus, tsukue &apos;desk&apos; no ashi &apos;leg&apos;, ryokou &apos;travel&apos; no jyunbi &apos;preparation&apos; hon-wo &apos;book-Acc&apos; yomu &apos;read&apos; Agent senm,onk</context>

Other proper resource should be incorporated; one possibility is to use the dictionary definition of N1. 6 Related Work From the view point of semantic roles of nouns, there have been several related research conducts: the mental space theory is discussing the functional behavior of nouns (Fauconnier, 1985); the generative lexicon theory accounts for the problem of creative word senses based on the qualia structure of a word (Pustejovsky, 1995); Dahl et al. (1987) and Macleod et al. (1997) discussed the treatment of nominalizations. Compared with these studies, the point of this paper is that an ordinary dictionary can be a useful resource of semantic roles of nouns. Our approach using an ordinary dictionary is similar to the approach used to creat MindNet (Richardson et al., 1998). However, the semanitc analysis of noun phrases is a much more specialized and suitable application of utilizing dictionary entries. 7 Conclusion The paper proposed a method of analyzing Japanese N1 no N2 phrases based on a dictionary, interpreting obscure phrases very clearly. The method can be appl</context>
