Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896454545455">
As the text databases available to users be-
come larger and more heterogeneous, genre
becomes increasingly important for com-
putational linguistics as a complement to
topical and structural principles of classifi-
cation. We propose a theory of genres as
bundles of facets, which correlate with var-
ious surface cues, and argue that genre de-
tection based on surface cues is as success-
ful as detection based on deeper structural
properties.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932292307692">
Computational linguists have been concerned for the
most part with two aspects of texts: their structure
and their content. That is. we consider texts on
the one hand as formal objects, and on the other
as symbols with semantic or referential values. In
this paper we want to consider texts from the point
of view of genre: that is. according to the various
functional roles they play.
Genre is necessarily a heterogeneous classificatory
principle, which is based among other things on the
way a text was created. the way it is distributed,
the register of language it uses, and the kind of au-
dience it is addressed to. For all its complexity. this
attribute can be extremely important for many of
the core problems that computational linguists are
concerned with. Parsing accuracy could be increased
by taking genre into account (for example, certain
object-less constructions occur only in recipes in En-
glish). Similarly for POS-tagging (the frequency of
uses of trend as a verb in the Journal of Commerce
is 35 times higher than in Sociological Abstracts). In
word-sense disambiguation, many senses are largely
restricted to texts of a particular style, such as col-
loquial or formal (for example the word pretty is far
more likely to have the meaning &amp;quot;rather&amp;quot; in informal
genres than in formal ones). In information retrieval.
genre classification could enable users to sort search
results according to their immediate interests. Peo-
ple who go into a bookstore or library are not usually
looking simply for information about a particular
topic, but rather have requirements of genre as well:
they are looking for scholarly articles about hypno-
tism, novels about the French Revolution, editorials
about the supercollider, and so forth.
If genre classification is so useful, why hasn&apos;t it fig-
ured much in computational linguistics before now?
One important reason is that, up to now, the digi-
tized corpora and collections which are the subject
of much CL research have been for the most part
generically homogeneous (i.e., collections of scientific
abstracts or newspaper articles, encyclopedias, and
so on), so that the problem of genre identification
could be set aside. To a large extent, the problems
of genre classification don&apos;t become salient until we
are confronted with large and heterogeneous search
domains like the World-Wide Web.
Another reason for the neglect of genre. though, is
that it can be a difficult notion to get a conceptual
handle on, particularly in contrast with properties of
structure or topicality. which for all their complica-
tions involve well-explored territory. In order to do
systematic work on automatic genre classification.
by contrast, we require the answers to some basic
theoretical and methodological questions. Is genre a
single property or attribute that can be neatly laid
out in some hierarchical structure? Or are we really
talking about a multidimensional space of properties
that have little more in common than that they are
more or less orthogonal to topicality? And once we
have the theoretical prerequisites in place, we have
to ask whether genre can be reliably identified by
means of computationally tractable cues.
In a broad sense, the word &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot; is merely a
literary substitute for &amp;quot;kind of text,&amp;quot; and discus-
sions of literary classification stretch back to Aris-

totle. We will use the term &amp;quot;genre- here to re-
fer to any widely recognized class of texts defined
by some common communicative purpose or other
functional traits, provided the function is connected
to some formal cues or commonalities and that the
class is extensible. For example an editorial is a
shortish prose argument expressing an opinion on
some matter of immediate public concern, typically
written in an impersonal and relatively formal style
in which the author is denoted by the pronoun we.
But we would probably not use the term &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot;
to describe merely the class of texts that have the
objective of persuading someone to do something,
since that class — which would include editorials,
sermons, prayers, advertisements, and so forth —
has no distinguishing formal properties. At the other
end of the scale, we would probably not use &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot;
to describe the class of sermons by John Donne, since
that class, while it has distinctive formal characteris-
tics, is not extensible. Nothing hangs in the balance
on this definition, but it seems to accord reasonably
well with ordinary usage.
The traditional literature on genre is rich with
classificatory schemes and systems, some of which
might in retrospect be analyzed as simple at-
tribute systems. (For general discussions of lit-
erary theories of genre. see. e.g., Butcher (1932),
Dubrow (1982), Fowler (1982), Frye (1957), Her-
nadi (1972), Hobbes (1908), Staiger (1959), and
Todorov (1978).) We will refer here to the attributes
used in classifying genres as GENERIC FACETS. A
facet is simply a property which distinguishes a class
of texts that answers to certain practical interests,
and which is moreover associated with a characteris-
tic set of computable structural or linguistic proper-
ties, whether categorical or statistical, which we will
describe as &amp;quot;generic cues.&amp;quot; In principle, a given text
can be described in terms of an indefinitely large
number of facets. For example, a newspaper story
about a Balkan peace initiative is an example of a
BROADCAST as opposed to DIRECTED communica-
tion, a property that correlates formally with cer-
tain uses of the pronoun you. It is also an example
of a NARRATIVE, as opposed to a DIRECTIVE (e.g..
in a manual), SUASIVE (as in an editorial), or DE-
SCRIPTIVE (as in a market survey) communication;
and this facet correlates, among other things, with
a high incidence of preterite verb forms.
Apart from giving us a theoretical framework for
understanding genres, facets offer two practical ad-
vantages. First, some applications benefit from cat-
egorization according to facet, not genre. For ex-
ample, in an information retrieval context, we will
want to consider the OPINION feature most highly
when we are searching for public reactions to the
supercollider. where newspaper columns, editorials.
and letters to the editor will be of roughly equal in-
terest. For other purposes we will want to stress
narrativity. for example in looking for accounts of
the storming of the Bastille in either novels or his-
tories.
Secondly. we can extend our classification to gen-
res not previously encountered. Suppose that we
are presented with the unfamiliar category FINAN-
CIAL ANALYSTS. REPORT. By analyzing genres as
bundles of facets, we can categorize this genre as
INSTITUTIONAL (because of the use of we as in edi-
torials and annual reports) and as NON-SUASIVE or
non-argumentative (because of the low incidence of
question marks. among other things), whereas a sys-
tem trained on genres as atomic entities would not
be able to make sense of an unfamiliar category.

1.1 Previous Work on Genre Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998664375">
The first linguistic research on genre that uses quan-
titative methods is that of Biber (1986; 1988; 1992;
1995), which draws on work on stylistic analysis,
readability indexing, and differences between spo-
ken and written language. Biber ranks genres along
several textual &amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot;, which are constructed
by applying factor analysis to a set of linguistic syn-
tactic and lexical features. Those dimensions are
then characterized in terms such as &amp;quot;informative vs.
involved&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;narrative vs. non-narrative.&amp;quot; Factors
are not used for genre classification (the values of a
text on the various dimensions are often not infor-
mative with respect to genre). Rather, factors are
used to validate hypotheses about the functions of
various linguistic features.
An important and more relevant set of experi-
ments, which deserves careful attention, is presented
in Karlgren and Cutting (1994). They too begin
with a corpus of hand-classified texts, the Brown
corpus. One difficulty here. however, is that it is
not clear to what extent the Brown corpus classi-
fication used in this work is relevant for practical
or theoretical purposes. For example, the category
-Popular Lore&amp;quot; contains an article by the decidedly
highbrow Harold Rosenberg from Commentary, and
articles from Model Railroader and Gourmet. surely
not a natural class by any reasonable standard. In
addition, many of the text features in Karlgren and
Cutting are structural cues that require tagging. We
will replace these cues with two new classes of cues
that are easily computable: character-level cues and
deviation cues.

2 Identifying Genres: Generic Cues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753">
This section discusses generic cues. the -observable-
properties of a text that are associated with facets.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986074">
2.1 Structural Cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929">
Examples of structural cues are passives, nominal-
izations. topicalized sentences, and counts of the fre-
quency of syntactic categories (e.g.. part-of-speech
tags). These cues are not much discussed in the tra-
ditional literature on genre. but have come to the
fore in recent work (Biber, 1995; Karlgren and Cut-
ting, 1994). For purposes of automatic classification
they have the limitation that they require tagged or
parsed texts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995571">
2.2 Lexical Cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974375">
Most facets are correlated with lexical cues. Exam-
ples of ones that we use are terms of address (e.g.,
Mr., Ms.). which predominate in papers like the New
York Times: Latinate affixes, which signal certain
highbrow registers like scientific articles or scholarly
works; and words used in expressing dates, which are
common in certain types of narrative such as news
stories.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989307">
2.3 Character-Level Cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990111111111">
Character-level cues are mainly punctuation cues
and other separators and delimiters used to mark
text categories like phrases. clauses, and sentences
(Nunberg, 1990). Such features have not been used
in previous work on genre recognition, but we be-
lieve they have an important role to play, being at
once significant and very frequent. Examples include
counts of question marks, exclamations marks, cap-
italized and hyphenated words, and acronyms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979706">
2.4 Derivative Cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934333333333">
Derivative cues are ratios and variation measures de-
rived from measures of lexical and character-level
features.
Ratios correlate in certain ways with genre, and
have been widely used in previous work. We repre-
sent ratios implicitly as sums of other cues by trans-
forming all counts into natural logarithms. For ex-
ample, instead of estimating separate weights a, 3,
and -y for the ratios words per sentence (average
sentence length). characters per word (average word
length) and words per type (token/type ratio), re-
spectively, we express this desired weighting:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.912483">
C + 1 W + 1
clog
S + 3 log W + 1 +710g T+1
as follows:
&apos;( a — 3 + 7) log( W + 1)—
a log(S + 1) + 3 log(C + 1) — log(T + 1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999779058823529">
(where W = word tokens. S = sentences. C&apos; = char-
acters, T = word types). The 55 cues in our ex-
periments can be combined to almost 3000 different
ratios. The log representation ensures that all these
ratios are available implicitly while avoiding overfit-
ting and the high computational cost of training on
a large set of cues.
Variation measures capture the amount of varia-
tion of a certain count cue in a text (e.g.. the stan-
dard deviation in sentence length). This type of use-
ful metric has not been used in previous work on
genre.
The experiments in this paper are based on 55
cues from the last three groups: lexical, character-
level and derivative cues. These cues are easily com-
putable in contrast to the structural cues that have
figured prominently in previous work on genre.

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.967607">
3.1 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998315625">
The corpus of texts used for this study was the
Brown Corpus. For the reasons mentioned above,
we used our own classification system, and elimi-
nated texts that did not fall unequivocally into one
of our categories. We ended up using 499 of the
802 texts in the Brown Corpus. (While the Corpus
contains 500 samples, many of the samples contain
several texts.)
For our experiments, we analyzed the texts in
terms of three categorical facets: BROW&apos;. NARRA-
TIVE, and GENRE. BROW characterizes a text in
terms of the presumptions made with respect to the
required intellectual background of the target au-
dience. Its levels are POPULAR, MIDDLE, UPPER-
MIDDLE, and HIGH. For example. the mainstream
American press is classified as MIDDLE and tabloid
newspapers as POPULAR. The NARRATIVE facet is
binary, telling whether a text is written in a narra-
tive mode, primarily relating a sequence of events.
The GENRE facet has the values REPORTAGE, ED-
ITORIAL, SCITECH, LEGAL. NONFICTION, FICTION.
The first two characterize two types of articles from
the daily or weekly press: reportage and editorials.
The level SCITECH denominates scientific or techni-
cal writings, and LEGAL characterizes various types
of writings about law and government administra-
tion. Finally, NONFICTION is a fairly diverse cate-
gory encompassing most other types of expository
writing, and FICTION is used for works of fiction.
Our corpus of 499 texts was divided into a train-
ing subcorpus (402 texts) and an evaluation subcor-
pus (97). The evaluation subcorpus was designed
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995509">
34
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997938083333333">
to have approximately equal numbers of all repre-
sented combinations of facet levels. Most such com-
binations have six texts in the evaluation corpus. but
due to small numbers of some types of texts. some
extant combinations are underrepresented. Within
this stratified framework, texts were chosen by a
pseudo random-number generator. This setup re-
sults in different quantitative compositions of train-
ing and evaluation set. For example. the most fre-
quent genre level in the training subcorpus is RE-
PORTAGE, but in the evaluation subcorpus NONFIC-
TION predominates.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997111">
3.2 Logistic Regression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999790857142857">
We chose logistic regression (LR) as our basic numer-
ical method. Two informal pilot studies indicated
that it gave better results than linear discrimination
and linear regression.
LR is a statistical technique for modeling a binary
response variable by a linear combination of one or
more predictor variables, using a logit link function:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.930322">
g(r)= log(7rI(1 — r))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965045454546">
and modeling variance with a binomial random vari-
able, i.e., the dependent variable log(r 1(1 — 7r)) is
modeled as a linear combination of the independent
variables. The model has the form g(r) = xi,3 where
r is the estimated response probability (in our case
the probability of a particular facet value), xi is the
feature vector for text i, and ,3 is the weight vector
which is estimated from the matrix of feature vec-
tors. The optimal value of i3 is derived via maximum
likelihood estimation (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989),
using SPlus (Statistical Sciences, 1991).
For binary decisions, the application of LR was
straightforward. For the polytomous facets GENRE
and BROW, we computed a predictor function inde-
pendently for each level of each facet and chose the
category with the highest prediction.
The most discriminating of the 55 variables were
selected using stepwise backward selection based on
the AIC criterion (see documentation for STEP.GLNI
in Statistical Sciences (1991)). A separate set of
variables was selected for each binary discrimination
task.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.762752">
3.2.1 Structural Cues
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987025">
In order to see whether our easily-computable sur-
face cues are comparable in power to the structural
cues used in Karlgren and Cutting (1994), we also
ran LR with the cues used in their experiment. Be-
cause we use individual texts in our experiments in-
stead of the fixed-length conglomerate samples of
Karlgren and Cutting, we averaged all count fea-
tures over text length.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991981">
3.3 Neural Networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991486486487">
Because of the high number of variables in our ex-
periments. there is a danger that overfitting occurs.
LR also forces us to simulate polytomous decisions
by a series of binary decisions. instead of directly
modeling a multinomial response. Finally, classical
LR does not model variable interactions.
For these reasons, we ran a second set of experi-
ments with neural networks, which generally do well
with a high number of variables because they pro-
tect against overfitting. Neural nets also naturally
model variable interactions. We used two architec-
tures, a simple perceptron (a two-layer feed-forward
network with all input units connected to all output
units), and a multi-layer perceptron with all input
units connected to all units of the hidden layer, and
all units of the hidden layer connected to all out-
put units. For binary decisions, such as determining
whether or not a text is NARRATIVE, the output
layer consists of one sigmoidal output unit: for poly-
tomous decisions, it consists of four (BRow) or six
(GENRE) softmax units (which implement a multi-
nomial response model) (Rumelhart et al., 1995).
The size of the hidden layer was chosen to be three
times as large as the size of the output layer (3 units
for binary decisions, 12 units for BROW, 18 units for
GENRE).
For binary decisions, the simple perceptron fits
a logistic model just as LR does. However, it is
less prone to overfitting because we train it using
three-fold cross-validation. Variables are selected
by summing the cross-entropy error over the three
validation sets and eliminating the variable that if
eliminated results in the lowest cross-entropy error.
The elimination cycle is repeated until this summed
cross-entropy error starts increasing. Because this
selection technique is time-consuming, we only ap-
ply it to a subset of the discriminations.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878461538462">
Table 1 gives the results of the experiments. For each
genre facet, it compares our results using surface
cues (both with logistic regression and neural nets)
against results using Karlgren and Cutting&apos;s struc-
tural cues on the one hand (last pair of columns)
and against a baseline on the other (first column).
Each text in the evaluation suite was tested for each
facet. Thus the number 78 for NARRATIVE under
method &amp;quot;LR (Surf.) All&amp;quot; means that when all texts
were subjected to the NARRATIVE test, 78% of them
were classified correctly.
There are at least two major ways of conceiving
what the baseline should be in this experiment. If
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998396">
35
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961622641509">
the machine were to guess randomly among k cat-
egories. the probability of a correct guess would be
1/k. i.e., 1/2 for NARRATIVE, 1/6 for GENRE, and
1/4 for BROW. But one could get dramatic improve-
ment just by building a machine that always guesses
the most populated category: NONFICT for GENRE.
MIDDLE for BROW, and No for NARRATIVE. The
first approach would be fair, because our machines
in fact have no prior knowledge of the distribution of
genre facets in the evaluation suite. but we decided
to be conservative and evaluate our methods against
the latter baseline. No matter which approach one
takes, however, each of the numbers in the table is
significant at p &lt; .05 by a binomial distribution.
That is, there is less than a 5% chance that a ma-
chine guessing randomly could have come up with
results so much better than the baseline.
It will be recalled that in the LR models, the
facets with more than two levels were computed by
means of binary decision machines for each level,
then choosing the level with the most positive score.
Therefore some feeling for the internal functioning of
our algorithms can be obtained by seeing what the
performance is for each of these binary machines,
and for the sake of comparison this information is
also given for some of the neural net models. Ta-
ble 2 shows how often each of the binary machines
correctly determined whether a text did or did not
fall in a particular facet level. Here again the ap-
propriate baseline could be determined two ways.
In a machine that chooses randomly, performance
would be 50%, and all of the numbers in the table
would be significantly better than chance (p &lt; .05,
binomial distribution). But a simple machine that
always guesses No would perform much better, and
it is against this stricter standard that we computed
the baseline in Table 2. Here, the binomial distribu-
tion shows that some numbers are not significantly
better than the baseline. The numbers that are sig-
nificantly better than chance at p &lt; .05 by the bi-
nomial distribution are starred.
Tables 1 and 2 present aggregate results, when
all texts are classified for each facet or level. Ta-
ble 3, by contrast, shows which classifications are
assigned for texts that actually belong to a specific
known level. For example. the first row shows that
of the 18 texts that really are of the REPORTAGE
GENRE level, 83% were correctly classified as RE-
PORTAGE, 6% were misclassified as EDITORIAL. and
11% as NONFICTION. Because of space constraints,
we present this amount of detail only for the six
GENRE levels, with logistic regression on selected
surface variables.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999685">
The experiments indicate that categorization deci-
sions can be made with reasonable accuracy on the
basis of surface cues. All of the facet level assign-
ments are significantly better than a baseline of al-
ways choosing the most frequent level (Table 1). and
the performance appears even better when one con-
siders that the machines do not actually know what
the most frequent level is.
When one takes a closer look at the performance
of the component machines, it is clear that some
facet levels are detected better than others. Table 2
shows that within the facet GENRE, our systems do
a particularly good job on REPORTAGE and FICTION,
trend correctly but not necessarily significantly for
SCITECH and NONFICTION, but perform less well for
EDITORIAL and LEGAL texts. We suspect that the
indifferent performance in SCITECH and LEGAL texts
may simply reflect the fact that these genre levels are
fairly infrequent in the Brown corpus and hence in
our training set. Table 3 sheds some light on the
other cases. The lower performance on the EDITO-
RIAL and NONFICTION tests stems mostly from mis-
classifying many NONFICTION texts as EDITORIAL.
Such confusion suggests that these genre types are
closely related to each other, as in fact they are. Ed-
itorials might best be treated in future experiments
as a subtype of NONFICTION, perhaps distinguished
by separate facets such as OPINION and INSTITU-
TIONAL AUTHORSHIP.
Although Table 1 shows that our methods pre-
dict BROW at above-baseline levels, further analysis
(Table 2) indicates that most of this performance
comes from accuracy in deciding whether or not a
text is HIGH BROW. The other levels are identified
at near baseline performance. This suggests prob-
lems with the labeling of the BROW feature in the
training data. In particular, we had labeled journal-
istic texts on the basis of the overall brow of the host
publication, a simplification that ignores variation
among authors and the practice of printing features
from other publications. We plan to improve those
labelings in future experiments by classifying brow
on an article-by-article basis.
The experiments suggest that there is only a
small difference between surface and structural cues.
Comparing LR with surface cues and LR with struc-
tural cues as input, we find that they yield about the
same performance: averages of 77.0% (surface) vs.
77.5% (structural) for all variables and 78.4% (sur-
face) vs. 78.9% (structural) for selected variables.
Looking at the independent binary decisions on a
task-by-task basis, surface cues are worse in 10 cases

and better in 8 cases. Such a result is expected if
we assume that either cue representation is equally
likely to do better than the other (assuming a bino-
mial model, the probability of getting this or a more
extreme result is E b(i: 18.0.5) = 0.41). We con-
clude that there is at best a marginal advantage to
using structural cues. an advantage that will not jus-
tify the additional computational cost in most cases.
Our goal in this paper has been to prepare the
ground for using genre in a wide variety of areas in
natural language processing. The main remaining
technical challenge is to find an effective strategy for
variable selection in order to avoid overfitting dur-
ing training. The fact that the neural networks have
a higher performance on average and a much higher
performance for some discriminations (though at the
price of higher variability of performance) indicates
that overfitting and variable interactions are impor-
tant problems to tackle.
On the theoretical side, we have developed a tax-
onomy of genres and facets. Genres are considered
to be generally reducible to bundles of facets, though
sometimes with some irreducible atomic residue.
This way of looking at the problem allows us to
define the relationships between different genres in-
stead of regarding them as atomic entities. We also
have a framework for accommodating new genres as
yet unseen bundles of facets. Finally, by decompos-
ing genres into facets, we can concentrate on what-
ever generic aspect is important in a particular appli-
cation (e.g., narrativity for one looking for accounts
of the storming of the Bastille).
Further practical tests of our theory will come
in applications of genre classification to tagging,
summarization, and other tasks in computational
linguistics. We are particularly interested in ap-
plications to information retrieval where users are
often looking for texts with particular, quite nar-
row generic properties: authoritatively written doc-
uments, opinion pieces. scientific articles, and so on.
Sorting search results according to genre will gain
importance as the typical data base becomes in-
creasingly heterogeneous. We hope to show that the
usefulness of retrieval tools can be dramatically im-
proved if genre is one of the selection criteria that
users can exploit.

By analyzing genres as bundles of facets, we can categorize this genre as INSTITUTIONAL (because of the use of we as in editorials and annual reports) and as NON-SUASIVE or non-argumentative (because of the low incidence of question marks. among other things), whereas a system trained on genres as atomic entities would not be able to make sense of an unfamiliar category. 1.1 Previous Work on Genre Identification The first linguistic research on genre that uses quantitative methods is that of Biber (1986; 1988; 1992; 1995), which draws on work on stylistic analysis, readability indexing, and differences between spoken and written language. Biber ranks genres along several textual &amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot;, which are constructed by applying factor analysis to a set of linguistic syntactic and lexical features. Those dimensions are then characterized in terms such as &amp;quot;informative vs. involved&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;narrative vs. non-narrative.&amp;quot; Factors are not used for genre classification (the values of a text on the various dimensions are often not informative with respect to genre).

An important and more relevant set of experiments, which deserves careful attention, is presented in Karlgren and Cutting (1994). They too begin with a corpus of hand-classified texts, the Brown corpus. One difficulty here. however, is that it is not clear to what extent the Brown corpus classification used in this work is relevant for practical or theoretical purposes. For example, the category -Popular Lore&amp;quot; contains an article by the decidedly highbrow Harold Rosenberg from Commentary, and articles from Model Railroader and Gourmet. surely not a natural class by any reasonable standard.

Examples of ones that we use are terms of address (e.g., Mr., Ms.). which predominate in papers like the New York Times: Latinate affixes, which signal certain highbrow registers like scientific articles or scholarly works; and words used in expressing dates, which are common in certain types of narrative such as news stories. 2.3 Character-Level Cues Character-level cues are mainly punctuation cues and other separators and delimiters used to mark text categories like phrases. clauses, and sentences (Nunberg, 1990). Such features have not been used in previous work on genre recognition, but we believe they have an important role to play, being at once significant and very frequent. Examples include counts of question marks, exclamations marks, capitalized and hyphenated words, and acronyms. 2.4 Derivative Cues Derivative cues are ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level features. Ratios correlate in certain ways with genre, and have been widely used in previous work. We represent ratios implicitly as sums of other cues by transforming all counts into natural log</context>

The optimal value of i3 is derived via maximum likelihood estimation (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989), using SPlus (Statistical Sciences, 1991). For binary decisions, the application of LR was straightforward. For the polytomous facets GENRE and BROW, we computed a predictor function independently for each level of each facet and chose the category with the highest prediction. The most discriminating of the 55 variables were selected using stepwise backward selection based on the AIC criterion (see documentation for STEP.GLNI in Statistical Sciences (1991)). A separate set of variables was selected for each binary discrimination task. 3.2.1 Structural Cues In order to see whether our easily-computable surface cues are comparable in p</context>

Nothing hangs in the balance on this definition, but it seems to accord reasonably well with ordinary usage. The traditional literature on genre is rich with classificatory schemes and systems, some of which might in retrospect be analyzed as simple attribute systems. (For general discussions of literary theories of genre. see. e.g., Butcher (1932), Dubrow (1982), Fowler (1982), Frye (1957), Hernadi (1972), Hobbes (1908), Staiger (1959), and Todorov (1978).) We will refer here to the attributes used in classifying genres as GENERIC FACETS. A facet is simply a property which distinguishes a class of texts that answers to certain practical interests, and which is moreover associated with a characteristic set of computable structural or linguistic properties, whether categorical or statistical, which we will describe as &amp;quot;generic cues.&amp;quot; In principle, a given text can be described in terms of an indefinitely large number of facets. For example, a newspaper story about a Balkan peace initiative is an example of a BROADCAST as opposed to DIRECTED comm</context>
