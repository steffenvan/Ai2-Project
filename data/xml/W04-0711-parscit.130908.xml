The need for associating, or ground-
ing, protein names in the literature with
the entries of proteome databases such
as Swiss-Prot is well-recognized. The
protein names in the biomedical litera-
ture show a high degree of morpholog-
ical and syntactic variations, and vari-
ous anaphoric expressions including null
anaphors. We present a biomedical
anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in or-
der to address the variations of protein
names and to further associate them with
Swiss-Prot entries as the actual entities in
the world. The system shows the per-
formance of 59.5% 75.0% precision and
40.7% 56.3% recall, depending on the
specific types of anaphoric expressions.
We apply BioAR to the protein names
in the biological interactions as extracted
by our biomedical information extraction
system, or BioIE, in order to construct
protein pathways automatically.

<bodyText confidence="0.99951604">
The need for identifying the antecedents of
anaphoric expressions in the literature is well-
recognized. Most previous approaches assume that
anaphoric expressions and their antecedents would
appear in the same documents. However, further
work is called for when such antecedents need to be
associated with actual entities in the world, where
the task of establishing the denotation of a named
entity with respect to the world or a model is known
as named entity grounding (Leidner et al., 2003).
In the biomedical domain where the phrases in the
literature tend to refer to actual biological entities
such as proteins, the phrases should be associated
with the actual entries of external resources (Hachey
et al., 2004). In this paper, we present a biomedi-
cal anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to
identify the actual referents of those phrases in the
biomedical literature and to annotate the phrases, es-
pecially those that refer to proteins, with the entries
of proteome databases such as Swiss-Prot by suit-
able anaphora resolution.
Anaphora resolution indicates the process of de-
termining the antecedent of an anaphoric expres-
sion. Traditional approaches to anaphora resolu-
tion in general domain utilize various constraints
or preferences from the morphological, syntactic,
and semantic points of view. The most promi-
nent proposal for anaphora resolution is a center-
ing theory (Grosz et al. (1995)), which identifies the
antecedents of pronouns with respect to discourse
structures, based on the observation that those en-
tities that have already been mentioned and are
more central than others tend to be referred back
by pronouns subsequently. Byron (2002) proposed
to identify the antecedents of pronominal references
in spoken dialogues by utilizing discourse struc-
tures with discourse entities and semantic filter-
ing. Castano et al. (2002) adopted a knowledge-
poor method, which focuses on resolving pronouns
robustly, for example with part-of-speech informa-
tion, positions of the candidate antecedents, agree-
(1) The yeast and mammalian branchpoint se-
quence binding proteins (BBP and mBBP/
SF1) contain both KH domain and Zn
knuckle RNA-binding motifs. There-
fore, we propose that all three of these
accessory RNA-binding modules bind
the phosphate backbone, whereas the KH
domain interacts specifically with the bases
of the BPS. (PMID:9701290)

ments and lexical features, in addressing problems
in the biomedical domain (cf. Mitkov et al. (1998)).
In the biomedical literature, an anaphoric expres-
sion works as the device of making an abbrevi-
ated and indirect reference to some biological ob-
ject or objects. This notion can be applied to all the
phrases in the literature which refer to proteins, in
that the phrases can be associated (or grounded) with
the protein entries in proteome databases, which bi-
ologists generally regard as the identities of pro-
teins. The protein-referring phrases in the litera-
ture include not only gene/protein names but also
anaphoric expressions and missing arguments of bi-
ological interactions (or null anaphors) which refer
to proteins.1
As for anaphoric expressions, previous ap-
proaches to anaphora resolution often stop at an-
tecedent noun phrases in the same documents, but
we propose to further identify the proteins that
are composed of protein domains referred to by
anaphoric expressions. For example, the anaphoric
expression the KH domain in the last sentence in Ta-
ble 1 refers to the domain shared by the proteins “the
yeast and mammalian branchpoint sequence binding
proteins (BBP and mBBP/SF1).”2
While previous approaches have dealt only with
the resolution of pronouns (e.g. it, they) and sortal
1As for anaphora resolution, there are three related kinds of
objects in biomedical domain, that is, pronouns, antecedents,
and real entities in the world, where pronouns and antecedents
are the phrases in the literature. Among antecedents, there can
be “anaphoric” ones, referring to other antecedents. Both pro-
nouns and antecedents eventually refer to real entities in the
world, so the protein-referring phrases in the literature include
both pronouns and antecedents in the literature.

and the underlined string is its antecedent.

anaphoric noun phrases (e.g. the protein, both en-
zymes), we can also restore the missing arguments of
the biological interactions, mostly represented with
nominal interaction keywords such as interaction
with or without determiners, by utilizing the con-
text (cf. Hong and Park (2004)). For example, the
omitted argument of interaction in the first exam-
ple in Table 2 is the sentential subject, or “MOB1.”
In the second example in Table 2, the two omit-
ted participants of the interaction represented by the
anaphoric expression this interaction are “lamin A”
and “emerin,” which are also the syntactic argu-
ments of the verb binds.
In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora
resolution system, BioAR, to ground the protein-
referring phrases in the biological interactions ex-
tracted by our biomedical information extraction
system, BioIE (Kim and Park, 2004; Park et al.,
2001), with Swiss-Prot entries. BioIE is a sys-
tem that extracts general biological interactions
of arbitrary types from the biomedical literature.
This system shows the performance of 88 92%
precision and 55 57% recall, or the F-scores of
68 70. While the output of BioIE includes com-
plex linguistic phenomena, such as anaphoric ex-
pressions, conjunctions, prepositional phrases, and
relative clauses, many of the noun phrases in the
results of BioIE refer to proteins since the rel-
evant interaction keywords, such as interact and
bind, mostly represent protein-protein interactions

BioAR identifies the antecedents of anaphoric ex-
pressions that appear in the results of BioIE and
annotates the protein-referring phrases with Swiss-
Prot entries. The system first locates pronouns,
noun phrases with determiners (DNPs), and bio-
logical interactions as the candidates of anaphoric
expressions. Table 3 shows the statistics of these
anaphoric expressions.4 The rest of the system is
implemented in the following four steps: 1) pro-
noun resolution, 2) resolution of anaphoric DNPs,
3) restoration of missing arguments in the biological
interactions, and 4) grounding the protein-referring
phrases with Swiss-Prot entries.

<bodyText confidence="0.966337791666667">
We adopt the centering theory of Grosz et al. (1995)
for the anaphora resolution of pronouns. In par-
ticular, we follow the observation that the entities
which have already been mentioned and are more
central than others tend to be referred back by pro-
nouns subsequently. For example, the candidate an-
tecedent in the sentential subject is preferred to that
in the sentential object (cf. Table 4).
As for possessive pronouns such as its and their,
we have found that the antecedents of these posses-
sive pronouns are mostly located in the same or pre-
ceding sentences and that possessive pronouns can
be classified into the following two types accord-
ing to the sentential locations of their antecedents,
3There are 232 noun phrases which can be associated with
Swiss-Prot entries, among 1,645 noun phrases in 516 biological
interactions extracted by BioIE from a subset of yeast corpus.

where 1) the antecedent of a possessive pronoun is
the protein name which is nearest to the left of the
possessive pronoun in the same sentence and 2) the
antecedent of another possessive pronoun is the left-
most protein name in the subject phrase of the same
or preceding sentence (cf. Table 5). We have also
found that the local context of a possessive pronoun
of the second type mostly shows syntactic paral-
lelism with that of its antecedent, as in the two they
of the second example in Table 5, while that of the
first type does not show parallelism where the an-
tecedents of such possessive pronouns are mostly
the protein names nearest to the left of the posses-
sive pronouns.5 Since the antecedents of possessive
pronouns of the second type can be detected with
the patterns that encode the parallelism between the
local context of a possessive pronoun and that of its
antecedent in the same sentence (cf. Table 6),6 we
have set the protein names, those nearest to the left
of the possessive pronouns in the same sentences, as
the default antecedents of possessive pronouns and
utilized the patterns, such as those in Table 6, in rec-
ognizing the possessive pronouns of the second type
and in locating their antecedents.

the noun phrases with definites, the noun phrases
that do not have antecedents in the context, i.e. non-

DNPs belonging to those classes in Table 7, by uti-

identifies the candidate antecedent with the highest
score as the antecedent of the anaphoric DNP (cf.
Castano et al. (2002)). For example, the system as-
signs penalties to the candidate antecedents whose
numbers do not agree with those of anaphoric DNPs.
Among the candidate antecedents of anaphoric
DNPs, the candidate antecedents in the sentential
subjects are preferred to those in the sentential ob-
jects or other noun phrases, following the center-
ing theory (Grosz et al., 1995). We have also
adopted salience measures to score each candidate
antecedent according to the morphological, syntac-
tic, and semantic characteristics of candidate an-
tecedents (cf. Castano et al. (2002)). For example,
when a DNP refers to a protein, its candidate an-
tecedents which refer to protein domains get nega-
tive scores, and when a DNP refers to a protein do-
main, its candidate antecedents which refer to pro-
tein domains get positive scores. Furthermore, when
a DNP refers to an enzyme, its candidate antecedents
which end with ‘-ase’ get positive scores.
In the process of resolving the anaphoric DNPs
referring to protein domains, the system identifies
the proteins which contain the domains referred to
by the anaphoric expressions. We have constructed
several syntactic patterns which describe the rela-

The system locates the coordinate noun phrases
with conjunction items such as ‘and’, ‘or’, and

anaphoric expressions. The system also locates the

antecedent of a plural anaphoric expression such as

BioAR also restores some of the missing argu-
ments of interaction keywords by utilizing the con-
text. When one or more syntactic arguments of
biological interactions in the results of BioIE are
elided, it is essential to identify the antecedents of
the omitted arguments of the interactions, or null
anaphora, as well. We have focused on resolving the
missing arguments of nominal interaction keywords,
such as interaction, association, binding, and co-
immunoprecipitate,10 based on the observation that
those keywords mostly represent protein-protein in-
teractions, and thus their omitted arguments refer to
proteins or protein domains in the previous context.
In case only one argument of an interaction keyword
is elided as in the first example in Table 2, the pro-
teins in the sentential subjects are preferred as an-
tecedents to those in other noun phrases of the sen-
tences which contain the interaction keyword. In
case both arguments of an interaction keyword are
elided as in the second example in Table 2, both the
sentences, whose main verbs are in the verbal form

ciation, binding, and co-immunoprecipitate, indicate physical
binding between two proteins, and thus they can be replaced
with one another. In addition to them, the interaction keywords
phosphorylation and translocation also often indicate protein-
protein interactions.

developed several patterns to deal with the variations

Prot entries actually indicate certain domains of

component (RPM2 YEAST), BioAR grounds the
phrases in the results of BioIE, which refer to pro-
tein domains, with the descriptions of Swiss-Prot
entries, by converting those phrases into the struc-
tures as utilized by Swiss-Prot. For example, the
phrase “the regulatory beta-subunit of casein kinase
II (CKII)” can be grounded with KC2B YEAST,
and the phrase “the individual protein subunits of
eukaryotic RNase P” with RPM2 YEAST. Further-
more, the information about the domains of a pro-
tein is sometimes described in the SUBUNIT field of
Swiss-Prot. For example, the protein domain name
“the RNA subunit of RNase P” can be grounded with
RPM1 in the SUBUNIT field of RPM2 YEAST, i.e.
“Consists of a RNA moiety (RPM1) and the protein
component (RPM2). Both are necessary for full en-
zymatic activity.” We leave the problem of looking
up the SUBUNIT field of Swiss-Prot as future work.
Since a protein name can be grounded with multi-
ple Swiss-Prot entries as shown in Table 12, BioAR
tries to choose only one Swiss-Prot entry, the most
appropriate one for the protein name among the
candidate entries, by identifying the species of the
protein from the context (cf. Hachey et al. (2004)).
For example, while the protein name Rpg1p/Tif32p
can be grounded with two Swiss-Prot entries, or
IF3A SCHPO, IF3A YEAST , the noun phrase
“Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpg1p/Tif32p” should
be grounded only with IF3A YEAST. Similar-
ily, the system grounds the protein name Sla2p
(8) The yeast two-hybrid system was used to
screen for proteins that interact in vivo with
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpg1p/Tif32p,
the large subunit of the translation initia-
tion factor 3 core complex (eIF3). Eight
positive clones encoding portions of the
SLA2/END4/MOP2 gene were isolated.
Subsequent deletion analysis of Sla2p
showed that amino acids 318-373 were
essential for the two-hybrid protein-protein
interaction. (PMID:11302750)

Prot entries, or SLA2 HUMAN, SLA2 MOUSE,

visiae in the same abstract as in Table 13.
In summary, BioAR first locates anaphoric noun
phrases, such as pronouns and anaphoric DNPs, and
interaction keywords that appear in the results of
BioIE, while it filters out non-anaphoric DNPs and
the interaction keywords with two explicit syntac-
tic arguments. The system identifies the antecedents
of pronouns by utilizing patterns for parallelism and
by following the observation in the centering theory.
The system identifies the antecedents of anaphoric
DNPs by utilizing various salience measures. In
particular, the system identifies the proteins which
contain the protein domains referred to by anaphoric
expressions. The system restores the missing argu-
ments of biological interactions from the context.
Finally, the system grounds the protein-referring
phrases in the results of BioIE with the most appro-
priate Swiss-Prot entry or entries.

We have analyzed the errors from each module of
BioAR. All the incorrect antecedents of pronouns
12While the missing arguments of biological interactions of-
ten occur in the training corpus, there was only one missing ar-
gument in the test corpus, which is correctly restored by BioAR.
This result is included into those of noun phrase resolution.
Moreover, the rules and patterns utilized by BioAR show a
low coverage in the test corpus. It would be helpful to uti-
lize a machine-learning method to construct such rules and pat-
terns from the training corpus, though there are few available
anaphora-tagged corpora.
(10) These triterpenoids were not only mam-
malian DNA polymerase inhibitors but
also inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases I
and II even though the enzymic charac-
teristics of DNA polymerases and DNA
topoisomerases, including their modes of
action, amino acid sequences and three-
dimensional structures, differed markedly.
... Because the three-dimensional struc-
tures of fomitellic acids were shown by
computer simulation to be very similar
to that of ursolic acid, the DNA-binding
sites of both enzymes, which compete
for the inhibitors, might be very similar.
(PMID:10970789)
Table 16: Incorrect resolution example of pronoun
resolution module
in the test corpus produced by the pronoun resolu-
tion module are due to incorrect named entity recog-
nition, as in the incorrectly identified named en-
tity “DNA double-strand” from the phrase “DNA
double-strand break (DSB)” and “-II’ in “topo-I or
-II.” This problem can be dealt with by a domain-
specific POS tagger and a named entity recog-
nizer. Further semantic analysis with the help of
the context is needed to deal with the errors of
noun phrase resolution module. For example, “these
triterpenoids” in Table 16 are inhibitors, and thus it
can be a candidate antecedent of the anaphoric DNP
the inhibitors.
In the process of protein name grounding,
BioAR grounds 8 abbreviations among 15 incor-
rectly grounded protein-referring phrases with irrel-
evant Swiss-Prot entries. Furthermore, among 32
protein-referring phrases not grounded by BioAR,
14 phrases are the same as the string topoisomerase
where the string always indicates “DNA topoiso-
merase” in the corpus of topoisomerase inhibitors.
To address this problem, we need domain-specific
knowledge, which we leave as future work.
Castano et al. (2002) presented a knowledge-poor
method to utilize salience measures, including parts-
of-speech, positions of the candidate antecedents,
agreements and lexical features. While the method
reportedly shows a relatively high performance of
77% precision and 71% recall, we note that the
method is unable to deal with domain-specific
anaphora resolution, for example the task of identi-
fying the proteins which contain the protein domains
referred to by anaphoric expressions.
Leidner et al. (2003) presented the method of
grounding spatial named entities by utilizing two
minimality heuristics, that is, that of assuming one
referent per discourse and that of selecting the
smallest bounding region in geographical maps.
Hachey et al. (2004) presented a method for ground-
ing gene names with respect to gene database identi-
fiers by dealing with various kinds of term variations
and by removing incorrect candidate identifiers with
statistical methods and heuristics. These methods
are similar to BioAR in that they also aim to ground
the phrases in texts with respect to the entities in the
real world. However, BioAR further contributes to
biomedical named entity grounding by dealing with
the relationships between proteins and their domains
and by identifying the species information of protein
names from the context.

<bodyText confidence="0.999929782608695">
BioAR identifies the antecedents of anaphoric noun
phrases that appear in the results of BioIE. The sys-
tem further identifies the proteins which contain the
domains referred to by anaphoric expressions by
utilizing several patterns which describe their rela-
tions. The system also identifies the missing argu-
ments of biological interactions by utilizing biologi-
cal interaction patterns. Finally, the system grounds
the protein-referring phrases with the most relevant
Swiss-Prot entries by consulting the species infor-
mation of the proteins.
We believe that anaphora resolution with database
entries may not be addressed in other domains as
straightforwardly as in this paper, since there are
quite few comprehensive resources with actual en-
tities. The task of grounding the protein-referring
phrases in the results of BioIE with Swiss-Prot en-
tries is crucial to building up incorporated protein
pathways consisting of the biological interactions
extracted by BioIE. We are currently working on in-
tegrating BioIE, BioAR, and other systems for on-
tology manipulation and information visualization
for synergistic knowledge discovery.

The protein names in the biomedical literature show a high degree of morphological and syntactic variations, and various anaphoric expressions including null anaphors. We present a anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to address the variations of protein names and to further associate them with Swiss-Prot entries as the actual entities in the world. The system shows the performance of 59.5% 75.0% precision and 40.7% 56.3% recall, depending on the specific types of anaphoric expressions.

The system first locates pronouns, noun phrases with determiners (DNPs), and biological interactions as the candidates of anaphoric expressions.

(1995) for the anaphora resolution of pronouns. In particular, we follow the observation that the entities which have already been mentioned and are more central than others tend to be referred back by pronouns subsequently. For example, the candidate antecedent in the sentential subject is preferred to that in the sentential object (cf. Table 4). As for possessive pronouns such as its and their, we have found that the antecedents of these possessive pronouns are mostly located in the same or preceding sentences and that possessive pronouns can be classified into the following two types according to</context>

Most previous approaches assume that anaphoric expressions and their antecedents would appear in the same documents. However, further work is called for when such antecedents need to be associated with actual entities in the world, where the task of establishing the denotation of a named entity with respect to the world or a model is known as named entity grounding (Leidner et al., 2003). In the biomedical domain where the phrases in the literature tend to refer to actual biological entities such as proteins, the phrases should be associated with the actual entries of external resources (Hachey et al., 2004). In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to identify the actual referents of those phrases in the biomedical literature and to annotate the phrases, especially those that refer to proteins, with the entries of proteome databases such as Swiss-Prot by suitable anaphora resolution.

Both are necessary for full enzymatic activity.” We leave the problem of looking up the SUBUNIT field of Swiss-Prot as future work. Since a protein name can be grounded with multiple Swiss-Prot entries as shown in Table 12, BioAR tries to choose only one Swiss-Prot entry, the most appropriate one for the protein name among the candidate entries, by identifying the species of the protein from the context (cf. Hachey et al. (2004)). For example, while the protein name Rpg1p/Tif32p can be grounded with two Swiss-Prot entries, or IF3A SCHPO, IF3A YEAST , the noun phrase “Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpg1p/Tif32p” should be grounded only with IF3A YEAST. Similarily, the system grounds the protein name Sla2p (8) The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins that interact in vivo with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpg1p/Tif32p, the large subunit of the translation initiation factor 3 core complex (eIF3).

However, further work is called for when such antecedents need to be associated with actual entities in the world, where the task of establishing the denotation of a named entity with respect to the world or a model is known as named entity grounding (Leidner et al., 2003). In the biomedical domain where the phrases in the literature tend to refer to actual biological entities such as proteins, the phrases should be associated with the actual entries of external resources (Hachey et al., 2004). In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to identify the actual referents of those phrases in the biomedical literature and to annotate the phrases, especially those that refer to proteins, with the entries of proteome databases such as Swiss-Prot by suitable anaphora resolution. Anaphora resolution indicates the process of deter</context>

To address this problem, we need domain-specific knowledge, which we leave as future work. Castano et al. (2002) presented a knowledge-poor method to utilize salience measures, including partsof-speech, positions of the candidate antecedents, agreements and lexical features. While the method reportedly shows a relatively high performance of 77% precision and 71% recall, we note that the method is unable to deal with domain-specific anaphora resolution, for example the task of identifying the proteins which contain the protein domains referred to by anaphoric expressions. Leidner et al. (2003) presented the method of grounding spatial named entities by utilizing two minimality heuristics, that is, that of assuming one referent per discourse and that of selecting the smallest bounding region in geographical maps. Hachey et al. (2004) presented a method for grounding gene names with respect to gene database identifiers by dealing with various kinds of term variations and by removing incorrect candidate identifiers with statistical methods and heuristics. These methods are similar to BioAR in that they also aim to ground the phrases in texts with respect to the entities in the real wo</context>

For example, the omitted argument of interaction in the first example in Table 2 is the sentential subject, or “MOB1.” In the second example in Table 2, the two omitted participants of the interaction represented by the anaphoric expression this interaction are “lamin A” and “emerin,” which are also the syntactic arguments of the verb binds. In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, to ground the proteinreferring phrases in the biological interactions extracted by our biomedical information extraction system, BioIE (Kim and Park, 2004; Park et al., 2001), with Swiss-Prot entries. BioIE is a system that extracts general biological interactions of arbitrary types from the biomedical literature. This system shows the performance of 88 92% precision and 55 57% recall, or the F-scores of 68 70. While the output of BioIE includes complex linguistic phenomena, such as anaphoric expressions, conjunctions, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses, many of the noun phrases in the results of BioIE refer to proteins since the relevant interaction keywords, such as interact and bind, mostly represent protein-protein interactions Anaphoric expression Co</context>
