We address the question of why cer-
tain adverb and preposition phrases
are only interpretable with respect to
the discourse, and not just their own
matrix clause. We show that, in many
cases, an adverbial&apos;s compositional se-
mantics explains why. We close by re-
porting on an annotation study aimed
at providing specific evidence for how
adverbials are interpreted with respect
to the discourse.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992419433962264">
Traditionally in linguistics, syntax and se-
mantics provide mechanisms to build the
interpretation of a sentence from its parts.
Although it&apos;s non-controversial that a se-
quence of sentences such as (1) also produces
an interpretation, the mechanisms are less clear.
(1) There is a high degree of stress level from
the need to compete and succeed in this &apos;me
generation&apos;. As a result, people have become
more self-centered over time.
Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) bases sequence interpretations
on &amp;quot;discourse&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;rhetorical&amp;quot;) relations. These
can be used to label interpretations of sentence
sequences, and (Marcu, 2000) shows that an au-
tomated method of labeling can partially repli-
cate human annotation. This automation relies
in part on cue phrases, or discourse connectives,
whose presence is taken to signal the presence
of particular discourse relations. In (1), the rel-
evant phrase is as a result, and the discourse
relation is not surprisingly a result relation.
There have also been several formal attempts
to build a compositional semantics for discourse,
including (van den Berg, 1996; Gardent, 1997;
Schilder, 1997). However, as in RST, this work
assumes all discourse connectives signal a rela-
tion between adjacent discourse units. DLTAG
(Webber et al., 2001), in contrast, proposes a
different role for adverbial phrases. While sub-
ordinating and coordinating conjunctions sig-
nal a relation between the interpretations of the
clauses they structurally connect, adverbials re-
late the interpretation of their matrix clause to
a clausal interpretation available anaphorically
from the discourse context. These distinctions
are based both on considerations of computa-
tional economy and behavioral evidence.
While DLTAG discusses adverbials that func-
tion as discourse connectives, it does not isolate
this subset from the set of all adverbials. In
this paper, we consider the larger class of adverb
(ADVP) and preposition (PP) adverbials. We
investigate the mechanisms that cause certain
adverbials, which we call discourse adverbials,
to be bound by the discourse context, while
other adverbials, which we call clausal adver-
bials, seem fully interpretable with respect to
just their matrix sentence (once anaphoric ref-
erences to entities are resolved&apos;). Clausal adver-
bials are exemplified in (2), and discourse adver-
bials in (3).
&apos;This is (Knott, 1996)&apos;s methodology, see Section 2.

Differences between these two types of adver-
bials cannot be attributed to syntax. Viewed
in terms of a tree structure, both types of ad-
verbials adjoin to the S node, and the resulting
structure is still an 52.

It is in terms of semantics and the argument
structure of adverbials that significant differ-
ences appear. We argue that both the num-
ber of semantic arguments an adverbial has and
the resolution of these arguments determines
whether or not it functions semantically or prag-
matically as a discourse or clause adverbial.
While the semantics and pragmatics discussed
here will not provide a complete account of the
discourse functions of all adverbials, it will show
that the analysis of adverbials can be viewed
modularly: certain functions can be attributed
to the semantic domain, others to the pragmatic
domain, and still others to larger issues of dis-
course structure.
There are numerous benefits of this analy-
sis. First, it is economical, making use of pre-
existing mechanisms to build the interpretation
of discourse, thereby reducing the load on infer-
ence to account for discourse interpretation (c.f.
(Kehler, 1995)). Secondly, it provides a theo-
retical grounding for (Knott, 1996)&apos;s empirical
approach to discourse connectives, in the pro-

cess showing that additional adverbials should
be included in the class, and that some of those
included there don&apos;t really belong. Thirdly, it
expands an existing model of discourse which
argues that discourse structure can be built di-
rectly on top of clause structure. It thereby
bridges the gap between the clause-level struc-
ture and the shallow discourse parse produced
by RST.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. In Section 2 we discuss prior research
into the semantics of adverbials. Section 3
presents our analysis. Section 4 discusses an
annotation project which uses this approach to
provide specific evidence for how adverbials are
interpreted with respect to discourse.

2 Prior Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939379310345">
The semantics of most discourse adverbials has
not been well studied. Work by (Knott, 1996)
is an exception. Although the lexical semantics
he proposes for adverbial cue phrases is orthog-
onal to the issues under discussion in this pa-
per, he developed an experimental methodology
aimed at isolating adverbials and conjunctions
that appear unacceptable outside of a discourse
context. Because his methodology relied com-
pletely on human judgments and did not con-
trol for factors such as intonation, his corpus
contains apparent &amp;quot;errors of omission&amp;quot; as well
as &amp;quot;errors of comission&amp;quot;. For example, his set
of connectives includes surprisingly and clearly
but not in that event or as a consequence (See
(Forbes, 2002) for further discussion).
In general, investigations into PP (Verspoor,
1997) and ADVP (Ernst, 1984) treat issues of
syntactic and semantic ambiguity at the clause
level; when discourse adverbials are mentioned
at all they are called &amp;quot;conjunctive adverbials&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;discourse connectives&amp;quot; and are specified as the
domain of discourse research. We can neverthe-
less use this research as a guide when building
the semantics of discourse adverbials, because
all S-adjoined ADVP and PP can be classified
along two semantic dimensions: (1) the type of
modification they perform; and (2) the type of
semantic object they modify.

<bodyText confidence="0.998256166666667">
(Ernst, 1984)&apos;s classification of modification
that ADVP clausal adverbials perform is shown
in Table 1. While there are no similar classifica-
tions in the literature of PP clausal adverbials,
it is easy to find PP synonyms for these ADVP.
Both are exemplified in the table.

<bodyText confidence="0.999858217391304">
While this classification may be useful for dis-
tinguishing ADVP functions, it does not help to
distinguish discourse from clausal adverbials.
A broader classification of modification type
can be formulated in terms of semantic features
to encompass both the discourse and clausal ad-
verbials. In such terms, adverbials supply man-
ner, spatio-temporal, and/or degree-of-likelihood
features to the semantic objects they modify,
among other features. For example, &amp;quot;clearly&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;generally&amp;quot; may supply both degree-of-
likelihood and spatio-temporal features. Such
features could be helpful for annotations such as
those described in Section 4, and are discussed
in more detail in (Forbes, 2002).
What these features do not capture is that
while adverbials like &amp;quot;tactfully&amp;quot; supply the man-
ner of an agent performing an action, adverbials
like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; supply the manner in which
the modified clause is related to the surround-
ing discourse. Accounting for this requires dis-
cussion of the semantic objects that these ad-
verbials supply features to, as we now discuss.

2.2 Type of Semantic Object
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.926526666666667">
Adverbials can also be classified according to the
type of semantic object they modify. This clas-
sification is described only vaguely in (Ernst,
1984) with respect to ADVP, in (Verspoor,
1997) with respect to PP, and across the adver-
bial literature in general. While (Moore, 1993)
provides a more formal analysis, we believe that
research on discourse deixis provides a better
basis for classification.

As shown in Table 2, Ernst&apos;s semantics makes
three distinctions between the modified clause:
it can be a situation, a state of affairs, or a men-
tal state. Specific properties of each are not dis-
cussed. Note that he makes use of the adjective
(ADJ) derivative of the ADVP. a refers to the
semantic object being modified by the ADVP.

2.3 Abstract Objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999755">
We argue here that the range of semantic ob-
jects evoked when an adverbial modifies a clause
coincides with the range of semantic objects to
which a discourse deictic refers.
Briefly, the term &amp;quot;discourse deixis&amp;quot; applies
to uses of demonstrative pronouns such as
(4)—(7), where their antecedents (derived from
the bracketed material) are interpretations of
entire clauses as in (4), more than one clause
as in (5), discourse relations between clauses,
such as the contrast relation in (6), and inferred
defeasible rules, such as in (7), where &amp;quot;if it&apos;s
raining the sun isn&apos;t shining&amp;quot; is presupposed
and denied (Knott, 1996).

In general, discourse deixis is used to refer
to the interpretation of non-NP consituents, in-
cluding (a set of) tensed or untensed clauses,
verb phrases, and adverbial phrases. The nature
of such interpretations goes under the rubric
Abstract Object (AO). (Asher, 1993) organizes
types of AOs as shown in Figure 2.
</bodyText>

Figure 2: (Asher, 1993) Classes of AOs
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995590909091">
Whether or not this classification of AOs is
complete, we argue that AOs provide an appro-
priate way of understanding adverbial seman-
tics. We end this overview of AOs with a com-
ment on how they can be formalized in the se-
mantics. Traditionally, only the proposition in-
terpretation of S&apos;s is formalized. The seman-
tic type of S is usually a truth value: true or
false. Discourse deictic research and adverbial
research both show that other interpretations
are possible. (Dahl and Hellman, 1995), for ex-
ample, use type coercion to access other AO in-
terpretations. Type coercion is a term taken
from computer science, where it defines an oper-
ation by which an expression which is normally
of one logical type is re-interpreted as another
(e.g., when an integer is understood as a Boolean
value). Type coercion has also been used to
explain linguistic phenomena, such as when an
expression which is indeterminate as to logical
type is &apos;coerced&apos; into one particular interpreta-
tion and thus acquires a fixed type.

Data for the following discussion was drawn
from both the Brown Corpus and WSJ Cor-
pus. Because both clausal and discourse adver-
bials adjoin to the S node, this syntactic prop-
erty was used to extract the data investigated in
this study. Using tgrep, all S-initial, S-adjoined
ADVPs and PPs were collected from the Tree-
bank parses of these corpora3. Counts of types
and tokens for S-initial, S-adjoined ADVPs and
PPs are shown in Table 3.4 For comparison,
counts of those occurring 12 or more times are
shown, labeled &amp;quot;&gt;11&amp;quot;. This comparison shows
that while high frequency S-adjoined ADVP to-
kens occur more frequently than high frequency
S-adjoined PP tokens, overall there are many
more tokens and types of S-adjoined PP in the
combined corpora. This is due to the wide vari-
ability in the internal PP argument; over half of
the PP tokens in these corpora occur only once.

ication on the discourse deictic that determines

example, is a property of events, so the referent
of the discourse deictic is interpreted as an event.

performs the predication, thereby determining
the AO interpretation.

More generally, notice that we can create a
PP adverbial for an AO, simply by inserting it
into the phrase &amp;quot;As a(n) ...&amp;quot;.
We claim that the AO interpretation of the
clause they adjoin to is the only semantic AO
argument of clausal adverbials. In contrast, dis-
course adverbials require more: they either take
a second AO argument or implicate at least
one other AO, thereby rendering them unin-
terpretable with respect to their matrix clause
alone, even after resolution of any NP-referring
constituents.
Discourse adverbials are thus very similar to
discourse deixis in the sense that both require
an AO interpretation from the prior discourse or
spatio-temporal context. (Webber et al., 2001)
provides strong behavioral evidence for this
view. One of their most compelling examples
is shown in (8). Just as in (6) the discourse
deictic takes as its referent the discourse rela-
tion between clauses, so does for example in
(8) select as its prior argument the result re-
lation (imparted by so) between the two clauses.

part as the NP argument of a PP S-modifier,
thereby creating a discourse adverbial which re-
lates two abstract objects. For that reason, in
that case, in this instance, after that are found
in the corpora and exemplify such cases.
Of course, explicit reference is not the only
mechanism by which discourse adverbials are
created. In the following sections we discuss
these and other mechanisms in greater detail.
We use a simplified version of lambda calculus
such as found in (Heim and Kratzer, 1998) to
represent the adverbials and their arguments.

We can represent ADVP as semantically akin
to ADJP and use its ADJP derivative. For ex-

the term itself, and x represents its structural

More generally, notice that a discourse deictic
can always be replaced by its explicit demon-
strative+AO counterpart, e.g.&amp;quot; that text&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;that
speech act&amp;quot;, etc. We can usually supply the de-
51n Bayesian epistemic models, the semantics of such
epistemic expressions is slightly more complex, because
they are interpreted with respect to possible worlds.
Note that many of these clausal adverbials
have a syntactically optional indefinite PP
argument, as exemplified in (11), which does
not resolve to an AO interpretation.
(11) Unfortunately (for John), vandals cov-
ered John&apos;s car in graffiti.
In general, syntactically optional arguments,
also called &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;, fall into two
types (Mittwoch, 1982): definite and indefinite.
Indefinite hidden arguments are not necessarily
anaphoric with anything. Examples include the
VP eat: &amp;quot;Mary ate (the food)&amp;quot;, and the NP
mother: &amp;quot;Mary talked to the mother (of John)&amp;quot;.
Definite hidden arguments are anaphoric to
some salient entity in the discourse context.
For example, the hidden argument in the apply
VP in (12) is the earlier-mentioned grant:
(12) The due date for the grant has passed.
Mary didn&apos;t apply 0.
Some ADVP discourse adverbials, like some
ADVP clausal adverbials, have hidden semantic
arguments. The crucial difference, however, is
that the hidden argument of ADVP discourse
adverbials is definite, and it resolves to an AO
interpretation. Examples are shown in Table 6,
along with their counts.

3.2.2 PP adverbials
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999104">
Structurally, PPs are more complex than
ADVP. A PP is composed of one internal (usu-
ally NP) argument, and one external argument.
Semantically, prepositions are thus binary
predicates. The semantics of prepositions is
represented as in (14), where P represents the
property supplied by the preposition &amp;quot;prep&amp;quot;,
and x and y represent its structural arguments:

<listItem confidence="0.713735">

<bodyText confidence="0.999092833333333">
The semantic interpretation of a PP 5-
modifier has the form of interpretation in (14).
For example, if city&apos; is taken to represent the
interpretation of the NP &amp;quot;the city&amp;quot;, then the
interpretation of the clausal adverbial &amp;quot;in the
city&amp;quot; can be written:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.894442">
(15) [[in]] = Ay.in&apos;(city&apos;,y)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999544833333333">
where y resolves to the interpretation of the
modified clause.
Note that if we exchange &amp;quot;the city&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;conse-
quence&amp;quot;, we produce the discourse adverbial &amp;quot;in
consequence&amp;quot;. What distinguishes PP clausal
adverbials from PP discourse adverbials, there-
fore, is the character of the internal NP argu-
ment.
Many of the PPs found in PP adverbials take
a proper noun as internal argument (Table 7)
and supply a spatio-temporal property to the
event interpretation of the modified clause.

adverbial functions as a discourse adverbial,
relating the AO interpretation of its matrix
clause with that of a previous clause. Note the
potential for ambiguity: In (17), &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; can
refer to the NP &amp;quot;the morning&amp;quot; or to the event
of waking early.

The internal argument of a PP adverbial can
also be a definite NP (Table 10).
Following (Heim and Kratzer, 1998), definite
determiners are partial functions, requiring the
noun they modify to return true for only one en-
tity in the set of individuals, but the resulting
interpretation may or may not be anaphoric, in
the sense that it refers back to an entity in the
prior discourse. Only when they are anaphoric
to an AO interpretation, will these PP adver-
bials function as discourse adverbials.

Returning to the example with which we

sible that the internal PP argument itself has a

These will receive a similar semantic treatment
to corresponding ADVP adverbials such as &amp;quot;ad-
ditionally&amp;quot; which contain hidden arguments.
Note that like definite, demonstrative, and
pronomial arguments, the resolution of hidden
61n many of these examples we can supply the argu-
ment (e.g. &amp;quot;in addition to this&amp;quot;). A reviewer has noted
that in German similar arguments are not optional; they
are either explicit or lexically incorporated into the ad-
verbial. For example, according to a German speaker,
&apos;als Folge&apos; or &apos;als Resultat&apos; is infelicituous, but &apos;als Folge
dessen&apos; (`as a result of that&apos;) is fine, and even better is
`demzufolge&apos;, (&apos;dem&apos; = `that&apos;; `zu&apos; = preposition meaning
&apos; as &apos;; &apos; folge/result at &apos; = &apos; consequence/result &apos;) .
arguments can be ambiguous. Consider (20):
(20) Complications is filled with other stories
demonstrating the capriciousness of medicine.
For example, Gawande once detected a case of
the rare, often fatal infection necrotizing fasci-
itis (flesh-eating bacteria) because he happened
to have seen a case a few weeks before. [The
Nation, 6 May 2002, p.35]
Gawande once detecting a case of necrotizing
fasciitis could be taken to be an example of any
of the following: (1) the fact of Complications
being filled with other stories demonstrating the
capriciousness of medicine, (2) the set of other
stories that demonstrate the capriciousness of
medicine, (3) the event of other stories demon-
strating the capriciousness of medicine, or (4)
the capriciousness of medicine (i.e. the NP).
Moreover, like discourse deixis, adverbial AO
arguments can sometimes be derived from sub-
clausal constituents (e.g. &amp;quot;He was tired and, de-
spite that, happy&amp;quot;.).
The potential for such ambiguities in ADVP
and PP adverbials means that unless the (hid-
den or explicit) anaphor can only be resolved
to a noun phrase rather than equally well to
the AO it participates in, it is likely most effi-
cient to resolve it to the most-inclusive AO that
makes sense in the context and derive more spe-
cific readings from that.
In the case of (20), if something is an example
of a book being filled with stories that demon-
strate X, then one can infer (if no evidence to
the contrary) that it is an example of such sto-
ries, and from that, that it is an example of
demonstrations of X, and from that, that it is
an example of X.
Understanding both the mechanisms that de-
termine which elements are accessible to func-
tion as antecedents and the elements which al-
low an AO interpretation to be derived, will
require the production and analysis of an an-
notated corpus, like the one described in Sec-
tion 4, and should, moreover, consider the anal-
yses already proposed for discourse deixis. (See
(Forbes, 2002) for further discussion.)

We end this discussion of adverbials by noting

to their argument structure that adverbials ap-

In these cases, the semantics contains only one
AO argument, the interpretation of the modified
clause. The truth or fact asserted by this clause
is asserted to be &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sure&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.
Similarly, the PP shown in Table 13 are gener-
ally viewed as discourse connectives. Following
(Heim and Kratzer, 1998), indefinite NPs and
common NPs denote sets of entities, and are
not in and of themselves referential. As such,

We believe that the explanation for why
Knott&apos;s subjects found such adverbials to
require a discourse context comes from se-
mantic mechanisms such as (topic) focus and
Contrastive Theme (Steedman, 2000) and/or
pragmatic mechanisms such as Conversational
Implicature (Grice, 1989). For example, adver-
bials in first position, as in:
(21) Nowadays we eat alot of vegetables.
may receive the same stress as other topicalised
constructions, linking them to what they are be-
ing used to illustrate or contrast with in the dis-
course context.
Focus and implicature can also interact with
discourse adverbials; in the focus literature, for
example, adverbials such as &amp;quot;at least&amp;quot; are gen-
erally viewed as being sensitive to focus, though
discussion is limited to non-clausal modification,
such as &amp;quot;Most of my friends are uneducated.
John at least finished high-school.&amp;quot; For further

4 Annotation Project
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991942955555556">
Because in the clause level parse, only one of the
arguments of discourse adverbials comes compo-
sitionally, the other must be retrieved from the
discourse. DLTAG views this as a problem of
anaphora resolution. As with other anaphora,
developing algorithms capable of resolving them
in way that reflects their actual distribution
in discourse requires developing an annotated
corpus. In this section, we discuss a project
(Creswell et al., ) to develop such a corpus, and
some of our initial results.
The main objective of this project is to build a
corpus with discourse annotation. While not a
complete representation of discourse structure,
it provides a rich intermediate level between
high level discourse structure and clause struc-
ture that can be reliably annotated, namely, the
syntax and semantics associated with discourse
connectives. We use the Penn Treebank anno-
tated corpus, which contains naturally occurring
data from a variety of sources, has been an-
notated for clause structure and part-of-speech,
and is being annotated for predicate-argument
structure. Our annotation schema is designed
to build an additional layer of discourse annota-
tion, with links to the clause level information.
Discourse annotation will occur in two stages.
First, the DLTAG parser (Forbes et al., 2001)
is used to parse the discourse, i.e. the struc-
tural arguments of each discourse connective.
Second, human annotators correct any errors
in the parse, and add annotation tags for the
anaphoric arguments of the discourse adverbials.
This strategy proved successful in the clause-
level annotation of the Penn Treebank corpus
in minimizing human effort.
Preliminary development of the project in-
volves determining an initial set of discourse
connectives to be annotated, building a seman-
tic frame for each connective, and developing
annotation tags. Semantic frames, modeled af-
ter those used in predicate-argument tagging,
are provided to the annotator, along with an-
notation tags and guidelines, to serve as a basic
semantics for each connective and help the an-
notators determine the relevant semantic roles
played by the context around them in the corpus
discourses. Each frame will indicate the num-
ber of arguments each connective takes, the se-
mantic or pragmatic relation it supplies to them,
their relevant semantic or pragmatic properties,
such as AO type, and semantic features of the
connectives such as mentioned in Section 2 and
in (Knott, 1996). The annotation tags so far de-
veloped include a POSITION tag, which records
the position of the adverbial in the clause it
modifies, a COMBINATION tag, which records
any other connectives that co-occur with the ad-
verbial in the clause, a TYPE tag, which records
the syntactic type of the argument, and a NOTE
tag, which records any unexpected behavior. So
far, three annotators have each annotated 75-
100 instances of three different discourse ad-
verbial, each representing one of three types of
discourse relation (concessive, resultative, addi-
tive), yielding a total of nine annotation sets.
A pilot study investigating the reliability of
human annotation of the anaphoric arguments
of discourse adverbials has employed a single
LOC tag with four possible values: SS (ar-
gument is within same main clause as con-
nective), PS (argument is within immediately
prior main clause), PP (argument spans multi-
ple main clause immediately prior), NC (argu-
ment found in non-contiguous prior clause). 25
instances of three adverbials, one from each of
the above-mentioned relation types, have been
inter-annotated by three different annotators.
Results are shown in Table 14, where all three
annotators produced the same tag.
As shown, agreement varies across adverbials,
due in part to the meaning of the adverbial, and
also to the size of its anaphoric argument. In
general, the larger the argument, the harder it
is to determine the exact unit from which it is
drawn. Resolution algorithms will have to take
these issues into account.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999828125">
The underlying theme of our work is that
discourse is not a completely separate category
from semantics and that discourse properties
arise from the same lexico-syntactic substrate
as clause-level semantic properties. Here we
have shown that what have been called &amp;quot;cue
phrases&amp;quot; are not an accidental grouping of
adverbials and PPs: their discourse properties
arise naturally from their semantics. Corpus
annotation and analysis will then allow us to
better understand the empirical realisation
of this view, and to better understand the
correspondences between discourse connectives
and discourse relations, such as when and which
discourse connectives are used, versus when and
which discourse relations are inferred.

Because his methodology relied completely on human judgments and did not control for factors such as intonation, his corpus contains apparent &amp;quot;errors of omission&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;errors of comission&amp;quot;. For example, his set of connectives includes surprisingly and clearly but not in that event or as a consequence (See (Forbes, 2002) for further discussion). In general, investigations into PP (Verspoor, 1997) and ADVP (Ernst, 1984) treat issues of syntactic and semantic ambiguity at the clause level; when discourse adverbials are mentioned at all they are called &amp;quot;conjunctive adverbials&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse connectives&amp;quot; and are specified as the domain of discourse research. We can nevertheless use this research as a guide when building the semantics of discourse adverbials, because all S-adjoined ADVP and PP can be classified along two semantic dimensions: (1) the type of modification they perform; and (2) the type of semantic object they modify. 2.1 Type of Modification (Ernst, 1984)&apos;s classification of modification that ADVP</context>

What these features do not capture is that while adverbials like &amp;quot;tactfully&amp;quot; supply the manner of an agent performing an action, adverbials like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; supply the manner in which the modified clause is related to the surrounding discourse. Accounting for this requires discussion of the semantic objects that these adverbials supply features to, as we now discuss. 2.2 Type of Semantic Object Adverbials can also be classified according to the type of semantic object they modify. This classification is described only vaguely in (Ernst, 1984) with respect to ADVP, in (Verspoor, 1997) with respect to PP, and across the adverbial literature in general. While (Moore, 1993) provides a more formal analysis, we believe that research on discourse deixis provides a better basis for classification. 2.2.1 (Ernst, 1984) As shown in Table 2, Ernst&apos;s semantics makes three distinctions between the modified clause: it can be a situation, a state of affairs, or a mental state. Specific properties of each are not discussed. Note that he makes use of the adjective (ADJ) derivative of the ADVP. a refers to the semantic object being modified by the A</context>

Although the lexical semantics he proposes for adverbial cue phrases is orthogonal to the issues under discussion in this paper, he developed an experimental methodology aimed at isolating adverbials and conjunctions that appear unacceptable outside of a discourse context. Because his methodology relied completely on human judgments and did not control for factors such as intonation, his corpus contains apparent &amp;quot;errors of omission&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;errors of comission&amp;quot;. For example, his set of connectives includes surprisingly and clearly but not in that event or as a consequence (See (Forbes, 2002) for further discussion). In general, investigations into PP (Verspoor, 1997) and ADVP (Ernst, 1984) treat issues of syntactic and semantic ambiguity at the clause level; when discourse adverbials are mentioned at all they are called &amp;quot;conjunctive adverbials&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse connectives&amp;quot; and are specified as the domain of discourse research. We can nevertheless use this research as a guide when building the semantics of discourse adverbials, because all S-adjoined ADVP and PP can be classified along two semantic dimensions: (1) the type of modification they perform; and (2) the type of semantic o</context>

A broader classification of modification type can be formulated in terms of semantic features to encompass both the discourse and clausal adverbials. In such terms, adverbials supply manner, spatio-temporal, and/or degree-of-likelihood features to the semantic objects they modify, among other features. For example, &amp;quot;clearly&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;generally&amp;quot; may supply both degree-oflikelihood and spatio-temporal features. Such features could be helpful for annotations such as those described in Section 4, and are discussed in more detail in (Forbes, 2002). What these features do not capture is that while adverbials like &amp;quot;tactfully&amp;quot; supply the manner of an agent performing an action, adverbials like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; supply the manner in which the modified clause is related to the surrounding discourse. Accounting for this requires discussion of the semantic objects that these adverbials supply features to, as we now discuss. 2.2 Type of Semantic Object Adverbials can also be classified according to the type of semantic object they modify. This classification is described only vaguely in (Ernst, 1984) with respect to ADVP, in (Verspoor, 1997) with </context>

Understanding both the mechanisms that determine which elements are accessible to function as antecedents and the elements which allow an AO interpretation to be derived, will require the production and analysis of an annotated corpus, like the one described in Section 4, and should, moreover, consider the analyses already proposed for discourse deixis. (See (Forbes, 2002) for further discussion.) 3.3 Other Factors We end this discussion of adverbials by noting that we are not claiming that it is only due to their argument structure that adverbials appear to require discourse for their interpretation.

John at least finished high-school.&amp;quot; For further discussion, see (Forbes, 2002). 4 Annotation Project Because in the clause level parse, only one of the arguments of discourse adverbials comes compositionally, the other must be retrieved from the discourse. DLTAG views this as a problem of anaphora resolution. As with other anaphora, developing algorithms capable of resolving them in way that reflects their actual distribution in discourse requires developing an annotated corpus. In this section, we discuss a project (Creswell et al., ) to develop such a corpus, and some of our initial results.

These can be used to label interpretations of sentence sequences, and (Marcu, 2000) shows that an automated method of labeling can partially replicate human annotation. This automation relies in part on cue phrases, or discourse connectives, whose presence is taken to signal the presence of particular discourse relations. In (1), the relevant phrase is as a result, and the discourse relation is not surprisingly a result relation. There have also been several formal attempts to build a compositional semantics for discourse, including (van den Berg, 1996; Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997). However, as in RST, this work assumes all discourse connectives signal a relation between adjacent discourse units. DLTAG (Webber et al., 2001), in contrast, proposes a different role for adverbial phrases. While subordinating and coordinating conjunctions signal a relation between the interpretations of the clauses they structurally connect, adverbials relate the interpretation of their matrix clause to a clausal interpretation available anaphorically from the discourse context. These distinctions are based both on considerations of computational economy and behavioral evid</context>

Of course, explicit reference is not the only mechanism by which discourse adverbials are created. In the following sections we discuss these and other mechanisms in greater detail. We use a simplified version of lambda calculus such as found in (Heim and Kratzer, 1998) to represent the adverbials and their arguments. 3.2.1 ADVP adverbials We can represent ADVP as semantically akin to ADJP and use its ADJP derivative. For example, the interpretation of gray (indicated as [[.1]) is as follows, where gray&apos; distinguishes the semantic property supplied by the term from the term itself, and x represents its structural argument: (9) [[gray]] = Ax[gray&apos;(x)] The interpretation of probably is thus represented as follows, where x resolves to the interpretation of the modified clause5: (10) [[probably]] = Ax[probable&apos;(x)] Common ADVP clausal adverbials are shown in Tab</context>

The internal argument of a PP adverbial can also be a definite NP (Table 10). Following (Heim and Kratzer, 1998), definite determiners are partial functions, requiring the noun they modify to return true for only one entity in the set of individuals, but the resulting interpretation may or may not be anaphoric, in the sense that it refers back to an entity in the prior discourse. Only when they are anaphoric to an AO interpretation, will these PP adverbials function as discourse adverbials.

Briefly, the term &amp;quot;discourse deixis&amp;quot; applies to uses of demonstrative pronouns such as (4)—(7), where their antecedents (derived from the bracketed material) are interpretations of entire clauses as in (4), more than one clause as in (5), discourse relations between clauses, such as the contrast relation in (6), and inferred defeasible rules, such as in (7), where &amp;quot;if it&apos;s raining the sun isn&apos;t shining&amp;quot; is presupposed and denied (Knott, 1996).

Each frame will indicate the number of arguments each connective takes, the semantic or pragmatic relation it supplies to them, their relevant semantic or pragmatic properties, such as AO type, and semantic features of the connectives such as mentioned in Section 2 and in (Knott, 1996). The annotation tags so far developed include a POSITION tag, which records the position of the adverbial in the clause it modifies, a COMBINATION tag, which records any other connectives that co-occur with the adverbial in the clause, a TYPE tag, which records the syntactic type of the argument, and a NOTE tag, which records any unexpected behavior.

Note that many of these clausal adverbials have a syntactically optional indefinite PP argument, as exemplified in (11), which does not resolve to an AO interpretation. (11) Unfortunately (for John), vandals covered John&apos;s car in graffiti. In general, syntactically optional arguments, also called &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;, fall into two types (Mittwoch, 1982): definite and indefinite. Indefinite hidden arguments are not necessarily anaphoric with anything. Examples include the VP eat: &amp;quot;Mary ate (the food)&amp;quot;, and the NP mother: &amp;quot;Mary talked to the mother (of John)&amp;quot;. Definite hidden arguments are anaphoric to some salient entity in the discourse context. For example, the hidden argument in the apply VP in (12) is the earlier-mentioned grant: (12) The due date for the grant has passed. Mary didn&apos;t apply 0.

These can be used to label interpretations of sentence sequences, and (Marcu, 2000) shows that an automated method of labeling can partially replicate human annotation. This automation relies in part on cue phrases, or discourse connectives, whose presence is taken to signal the presence of particular discourse relations. In (1), the relevant phrase is as a result, and the discourse relation is not surprisingly a result relation. There have also been several formal attempts to build a compositional semantics for discourse, including (van den Berg, 1996; Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997). However, as in RST, this work assumes all discourse connectives signal a relation between adjacent discourse units. DLTAG (Webber et al., 2001), in contrast, proposes a different role for adverbial phrases. While subordinating and coordinating conjunctions signal a relation between the interpretations of the clauses they structurally connect, adverbials relate the interpretation of their matrix clause to a clausal interpretation available anaphorically from the discourse context.

Following (Heim and Kratzer, 1998), indefinite NPs and common NPs denote sets of entities, and are not in and of themselves referential. As such, their interpretation should be fully interpretable in isolation. Count Adverbial 24 in any case 21 for one thing 117 of course 105 in fact 49 after all Table 13: Other PP Adverbials We believe that the explanation for why Knott&apos;s subjects found such adverbials to require a discourse context comes from semantic mechanisms such as (topic) focus and Contrastive Theme (Steedman, 2000) and/or pragmatic mechanisms such as Conversational Implicature (Grice, 1989). For example, adverbials in first position, as in: (21) Nowadays we eat alot of vegetables. may receive the same stress as other topicalised constructions, linking them to what they are being used to illustrate or contrast with in the discourse context. Focus and implicature can also interact with discourse adverbials; in the focus literature, for example, adverbials such as &amp;quot;at least&amp;quot; are generally viewed as being sensitive to focus, though discussion is limited to non-clausal modification, such as &amp;quot;Most of my frien</context>

Because his methodology relied completely on human judgments and did not control for factors such as intonation, his corpus contains apparent &amp;quot;errors of omission&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;errors of comission&amp;quot;. For example, his set of connectives includes surprisingly and clearly but not in that event or as a consequence (See (Forbes, 2002) for further discussion). In general, investigations into PP (Verspoor, 1997) and ADVP (Ernst, 1984) treat issues of syntactic and semantic ambiguity at the clause level; when discourse adverbials are mentioned at all they are called &amp;quot;conjunctive adverbials&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse connectives&amp;quot; and are specified as the domain of discourse research. We can nevertheless use this research as a guide when building the semantics of discourse adverbials, because all S-adjoined ADVP and PP can be classified along two semantic dimensions: (1) the type of modification they perform; and (2) the type of semantic object they modify. 2.1 Type of Modification (Ernst, 1984)&apos;s classification of</context>

What these features do not capture is that while adverbials like &amp;quot;tactfully&amp;quot; supply the manner of an agent performing an action, adverbials like &amp;quot;in addition&amp;quot; supply the manner in which the modified clause is related to the surrounding discourse. Accounting for this requires discussion of the semantic objects that these adverbials supply features to, as we now discuss. 2.2 Type of Semantic Object Adverbials can also be classified according to the type of semantic object they modify. This classification is described only vaguely in (Ernst, 1984) with respect to ADVP, in (Verspoor, 1997) with respect to PP, and across the adverbial literature in general. While (Moore, 1993) provides a more formal analysis, we believe that research on discourse deixis provides a better basis for classification. 2.2.1 (Ernst, 1984) As shown in Table 2, Ernst&apos;s semantics makes three distinctions between the modified clause: it can be a situation, a state of affairs, or a mental state. Specific properties of each are not discussed. Note that he makes use of the adjective (ADJ) derivative of the ADVP. a refers to the semantic object being modified by the ADVP.

We claim that the AO interpretation of the clause they adjoin to is the only semantic AO argument of clausal adverbials. In contrast, discourse adverbials require more: they either take a second AO argument or implicate at least one other AO, thereby rendering them uninterpretable with respect to their matrix clause alone, even after resolution of any NP-referring constituents. Discourse adverbials are thus very similar to discourse deixis in the sense that both require an AO interpretation from the prior discourse or spatio-temporal context. (Webber et al., 2001) provides strong behavioral evidence for this view. One of their most compelling examples is shown in (8). Just as in (6) the discourse deictic takes as its referent the discourse relation between clauses, so does for example in (8) select as its prior argument the result relation (imparted by so) between the two clauses.
