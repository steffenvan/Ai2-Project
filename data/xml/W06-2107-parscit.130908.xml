Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999322">
This paper describes ongoing work, aimed
at producing a lexicon of prepositions, i.e.
relations denoted by prepositions, to be
used for information retrieval purposes.
The work is ontology based, which for this
project means that the ontological types of
the arguments of the preposition are con-
sidered, rather than the word forms. Thus,
sense distinctions are made based on onto-
logical constraints on the arguments.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999980434782609">
In traditional web search engines, information re-
trieval relies more or less exclusively on sim-
ple string match. In the OntoQuery project1,
ontology-based search in text databases is per-
formed based on a match between the concep-
tual content of the search phrase and the text seg-
ments in the database.(Andreasen et al., 2002; An-
dreasen et al., 2004). In short, concepts are identi-
fied through their corresponding surface form and
mapped into an ontology. The use of an ontology
makes it possible to introduce the notion of con-
ceptual distance and thereby ranking the search re-
sult by semantic similarity. E.g. “pony” and “ze-
bra” may be more similar concepts than “pony”
and “lion”, because the distance when traversing
a graph representation of the ontology is longer
going from “pony” to “lion” than from “pony” to
“zebra”. See figure 1 for a simplified excerpt of
the ontology.
However, only relatively simple noun phrases
are currently recognized and mapped into the on-
tology, and we are thus investigating the possibil-
ities of expanding the scope of our concept-based

analysis by including the semantic relations that
hold between noun phrases. Our first experiments
in this have been an analysis of prepositions and
their surrounding noun phrases. The immediate
aim is to be able to include a lexicon of preposi-
tions, consisting of a lexicon entry for each sense
of a given preposition (a sense, in this context, is
a relation that it can denote). Each entry has an
argument structure and ontological constraints on
the arguments. Thus, a preposition in a given con-
text will be assigned a pertinent sense based on the
ontological types of its surrounding noun phrases.
If this can be achieved, we will be able to say, e.g.,
that the text segments “she is riding her pony in the
morning” and “he was riding a pony during the
war” are more closely related, i.e. the relational
distance is smaller, than any of the two to “she
was riding her pony in the hall”. The relations that
hold between “pony” and “morning”, and “pony”
and “war”, denoted by in and during respectively,
are of a temporal nature, whereas the relation that
holds between “pony” and “hall”, denoted by in, is
of a locative nature. The notion of relational dis-
tance is similar to that of conceptual distance; the
distance when traversing a graph representation of
the relation ontology. A combined measure, that
takes into account both the conceptual and rela-

tional distance would have to be introduced in or-
der to express the combined distance between such
more complex structures (structures that are more
complex than the simple noun phrases, that is), but
this question is beyond the scope of this paper2.
Initially, we use a predefined set of relations that
was originally proposed in (Nilsson, 2001) (see
table 1). This set is hierarchically unstructured,
which means that per default, the conceptual dis-
tance between any given two pairs of relations is
the same. We will later introduce an ontology of
relations, which will make it possible to express
that the distance between e.g. the partitive and the
locative relation is smaller than the distance be-
tween the locative and the causal relation (see sec-
tion 4.1).

2 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979285714286">
We are using a bottom-up approach, in which we
manually annotate a corpus3 with semantic rela-
tions for all occurences of prepositions that are
surrounded by noun phrases. Further we anno-
tate the heads of the surrounding noun phrases
with their ontological type and subsequently an-
alyze the result in order to produce ontological
constraint rules. The ontology that was used for
the ontological type annotation, is the SIMPLE top
ontology (Pedersen, 1999; Lenci et al., 2000).
Relations exist between the entities referred to in
discourse, and can exist at different syntactic lev-
els; across sentence boundaries as in Peter owns
a pony. It is stubborn , or whithin a sentence, a
phrase or a word. The relations can be denoted by
different parts of speech, such as a verb, a prepo-
sition or an adjective, or they can be implicitly
present in compounds and genitive constructions
as in Peter’s pony.
The following account is based on the work of
(Jensen and Nilsson, 2006): Semantic relations are
n-ary (where n&gt;_1): In the example Peter owns a
pony the verb ’owns’ denotes a binary relation be-
tween Peter and a pony, and in example Peter gave
the pony a carrot, the verb ’give’ denotes a ternary
relation between Peter, the pony and a carrot. In
the example The pony in the field the preposition
’in’ denotes a binary relation between the pony

and the field. In the framework of this project,
however, we will only consider binary relations
denoted by prepositions. Using the algebraic de-
scription language OntoLog (Nilsson, 2001), we
express binary relations as A[REL:BJ, where the
first argument of the relation, A, relates to the sec-
ond argument, B, in the manner REL.
A preposition, however, can be ambiguous in re-
gard to which relation it denotes (we assume a re-
stricted set of possible relations for prepositions,
see table 1). As an example, let us consider the
Danish preposition i (Eng: in): The surface form i
in ‘A i B’ can denote at least five different relations
between A and B:

1. A patient relation PNT; a relation where one of the ar-
guments’ case role is patient, e.g. “ændringer i stof-

2. A locational relation LOC; a relation that denotes the
location/position of one of the arguments compared to
the other argument, e.g. “skader i hjertemuskulaturen”
(injuries in the heart muscle).
3. A temporal relation TMP; a relation that denotes the
placement in time of one of the arguments compared
to the other, e.g. “generalforsamlingen i 1981” (the
general assembly in 1981).

3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768833333333">
Following the initial annotation, we performed an
analysis of all occurences of the relations and the
ontological types of their arguments. Could we
identify patterns that could result in lexical rules
for the lexicon? The limited space here does not
allow us to show the full results of the analysis,
so we will focus on one preposition, the Danish
preposition i (Eng: in) and later focus on one
relation type denoted by that preposition, namely
the locative relation. There are 199 occurences of
the preposition i in the corpus, and the relations
that it denotes are distributed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9898322">
LOC (137/199 : 68,8%)
WRT (25/199 : 12,5%)
TMP (17/199 : 8,5%)
PNT (11/199 : 5.5%)
CHR (9/199 : 4,5%)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828571428572">
If we look at the LOC relation, which is the
most frequent relation denoted by i in the corpus,
we get this distribution of ontological types for the
arguments: Of the 137 instances of i denoting a
locative relation, there are 57 different ontological
type-pairs, if we consider unique occurences of a
given onlogical type-pair (a pair, meaning the on-
tological types of the two arguments combined),
31 different first arguments, and 16 different sec-
ond arguments. The most significant ontological
type for arguments is the type “body part” (BPA),
which occurs 10 times as first argument, and 66
times as second argument. However, in total, the
type occurs 119 times (13 times as first argument
and 106 times as second argument) in the corpus
as a whole. If we were to implement a rule that
would assign the relation LOC to any preposition
that has the ontological type “body part” as any ar-
gument, we would get a precision4 score of 68.9.,
a higher score of 92.3 if we only consider the first
argument, and 66 if we only consider the second
argument.
However, if we limit the rule to assign the relation
LOC only to occcurences of the preposition i, with
arguments of the type BPA, then we get a precision
score of 100. This sounds promising, but it should
be noted that the coverage of the best rule “IF any
argument is BPA AND preposition is ’i’ THEN as-

sign LOC to preposition” is quite low: the recall5
score for the rule is 55.8, which means that we can
correctly assign a relation to 55.8% of the LOC
senses of the preposition i, and these only make
up 68.8% of the total number of i-occurences. In
fact, we can only correctly assign the LOC rela-
tion to 38.7% of the actual relations denoted by i
in the corpus using this rule. Only if we can pro-
duce more rules of this type with high precision
scores, we can be optimistic about the outcome of
the project.

4 Suggestions to improve the results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937764705882">
In the following, we propose a way of improving
the results by introducing a relation ontology, and
further, by either generalizing or specializing the
ontological type level for the arguments. Our
hypothesis is that by doing this, we will end
up with rules that have broader coverage. By
coverage, we mean the number of occurences
that the rule applies to, compared to the number
of occurences that potentially could be covered
by the rule.If the relations are too general, then
we miss out on some of the semantic content of
the relation between the items that we consider,
and we want to capture as much semantics as we
can. On the other hand, in some cases it may be
that we have made distinctions in the relation set
that are not detectable when analyzing the data.
Also, if the ontological type distribution for the

patterns that appear when we analyze the data,
will not be general enough to produce rules from.

4.1 The relation ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987634146341">
The flat list of possible relations, as can be seen
in table 1, that we initially used, now has to be
transformed into a relation ontology. Our heuris-
tics for doing this, in short, is to group relations
that are more closely related than others in sub-
branches, such that the distance between them is
shorter than the distance to other less closely re-
lated relations. In figure 2, the intralocal and ex-
tralocal relations are more closely related than e.g.
the intralocal and dynamic relation, because the
distance when traversing the graph is two archs for
the former, and three arcs for the latter. One way
of deciding relatedness, is to say that if two rela-
tions have proven difficult to differentiate in the
initial annotation process, then they are probably
more closely related. This is the approach we have
chosen. Also, we have grouped together other re-
lations, such as the bidirective relations ’part of’
and ’has parts’, and ’causes’ and ’caused by’, and
other relations that naturally group together, such
as the theta roles ’agent’-’patient’ and ’source’-
’result’.
A possible next step is to specialize the rela-
tions that can be specialized. The relations that
intuitively make sense to specialize are the tem-
poral (as has been done in OWL-Time ontology
(formerly DAML-Time) (Hobbs and Pan, 2004)),
partitive (Winston and Hermann, 1987) and spa-
tial/local relations (e.g. DOLCE Spatialrel ontol-
ogy)6.
Our work with specialisations of the relation
ontology, particularly the local relations, is largely
inspired by Pustejovsky’s work on event struc-
tures (Pustejovsky, 1996). Pustejovsky suggests a
subdivision of complex events into subevents.
However, another way of expressing the dif-
ference between events with one or more
subevents is, as we will do in the following,
static and dynamic relations: static relations only
consist of one subevent, and dynamic relations
have more than one subevent.

<bodyText confidence="0.998678777777778">
Another type of specialisation of the locative re-
lation could be a subdivision into relations con-
cerning area, region, distance, etc. (as it has been
done in DOLCE), but the aforementioned static
and dynamic locative relations appears to be more
appropriate when the subject is relations denoted
by prepositions.
As a possible further specialisation of dynamic
and static relations we suggest:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9895397">
• Intralocal: an intralocal relation denotes a
goal of a process (e.g. into the box), or a
location within a delimited area.
• Extralocal: an extralocal relation denotes a
point of departure of a process (e.g. out of
the box), or a location outside or touching
the outer limitation of a delimited area.
• Translocal: a translocal relation denotes a
location or a process through a delimited
area (e.g. through the box).

<bodyText confidence="0.999996138888889">
We now reannotate the locative relations ac-
cording to these new subtypes of the locative re-
lation; but conforming to the bottom-up approach,
we initially only subdivide into static and dynamic
locative relations. Can we observe a clearer pat-
tern with respect to the ontological types of the
arguments, if we do this? If so, then we try a more
fine grained subdivision.
The results of the LOC dynamic and LOC static
subdivision show that of the original 137 instances
of i that denote a locative relation, 33 denote a
LOC dynamic relation, and 104 denote a LOC
static relation. The patterns that we observe, are
actually clearer: for all, but one, of the dynamic
relations the first arguments denote some kind of
process or event, whereas the second arguments
are all more or less specialized types of concrete
entity. The most prevalent ontological type for the
static local relation is “natural substance”, which
occurs 50 times. For the dynamic local relation,
the most prevalent relation for the first argument is
“change”, which occurs 17 times. The most preva-
lent second argument is again “body part”, which
also occurs 17 times. If we now calculate preci-
sion and recall for rules that constrain arguments
of the static and dynamic locative relations to the
most prevalent ones, we get the results shown in
tables 3 and 4. However, we only calculate scores
for rules constraining the first argument, and only
for the preposition i, because only part of the cor-
pus has been annotated with these relations.
The precision score for the best rule is lower
than for the original LOC-rules (92.1 compared
to 100). However, considering that we capture
more semantics, and the fact that the arguments of
the static and dynamic locative relations are more

Our aim is to show that ontological types can be
used as constraints in a lexicon of semantic rela-
tions denoted by prepositions. In this paper we
have presented our preliminary results, that are
based on an analysis of a Danish corpus, com-
piled of texts from the domain of nutrition. We
have introduced an ontology of relations, which
will make it possible to measure relational dis-
tance between complex structures in addition to
the conceptual distance that we can measure be-
tween concepts. The results are promising: We
can produce rules that have good precision scores
for the locative relation, and we expect to improve
the rules by generalizing the ontological types of
the prepositional arguments. Also, we plan to ex-
pand our research to cover other relations than the

The work is ontology based, which for this project means that the ontological types of the arguments of the preposition are considered, rather than the word forms. Thus, sense distinctions are made based on ontological constraints on the arguments. 1 Introduction In traditional web search engines, information retrieval relies more or less exclusively on simple string match. In the OntoQuery project1, ontology-based search in text databases is performed based on a match between the conceptual content of the search phrase and the text segments in the database.(Andreasen et al., 2002; Andreasen et al., 2004). In short, concepts are identified through their corresponding surface form and mapped into an ontology. The use of an ontology makes it possible to introduce the notion of conceptual distance and thereby ranking the search result by semantic similarity. E.g. “pony” and “zebra” may be more similar concepts than “pony” and “lion”, because the distance when traversing a graph representation of the ontology is longer going from “pony” to “lion” than from “pony” to “zebra”. See figure 1 for a simplified excerpt of the ontology. However, only relatively simple noun phrases</context>

This is the approach we have chosen. Also, we have grouped together other relations, such as the bidirective relations ’part of’ and ’has parts’, and ’causes’ and ’caused by’, and other relations that naturally group together, such as the theta roles ’agent’-’patient’ and ’source’- ’result’. A possible next step is to specialize the relations that can be specialized. The relations that intuitively make sense to specialize are the temporal (as has been done in OWL-Time ontology (formerly DAML-Time) (Hobbs and Pan, 2004)), partitive (Winston and Hermann, 1987) and spatial/local relations (e.g. DOLCE Spatialrel ontology)6. Our work with specialisations of the relation ontology, particularly the local relations, is largely inspired by Pustejovsky’s work on event structures (Pustejovsky, 1996). Pustejovsky suggests a subdivision of complex events into subevents. However, another way of expressing the difference between events with one or more subevents is, as we will do in the following, static and dynamic relations: static relations only consist of one subevent, and dynamic relations have more than one subevent</context>

Initially, we use a predefined set of relations that was originally proposed in (Nilsson, 2001) (see table 1). This set is hierarchically unstructured, which means that per default, the conceptual distance between any given two pairs of relations is the same. We will later introduce an ontology of relations, which will make it possible to express that the distance between e.g. the partitive and the locative relation is smaller than the distance between the locative and the causal relation (see section 4.1). 2 Approach We are using a bottom-up approach, in which we manually annotate a corpus3 with semantic relations for all occurences of prepositions that are surrounded by noun phrases. </context>
