Annotation of discourse phenomena is a notoriously
difficult task which cannot be carried out without the
help of annotation tools. In this paper, we present
an annotation tool successfully employed in three
tasks which capture various discourse phenomena.
In addition it proved useful in several other simpler
tasks. Even though the annotation still needs to be
done by humans, the features of the tool facilitate
the process.
The structure of this paper is as follows: In
Section 2 we discuss some of the requirements of
annotation tools. Several such tools are discussed
in Section 3 explaining why we decided to develop
our own annotator. A brief description of it is
presented in Section 4, followed by a three case
studies briefly showing how the tool was used for
marking different discourse phenomena. The article
finishes with conclusions indicating ways to further
develop the tool.

2 Requirements of annotation tools
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999395625">
In recent years the need to produce reusable corpora
led to an increasing use of XML encoding in
annotation. As a result, the annotation cannot
be applied using simple text editors. In addition,
the discourse annotation is usually complicated
requiring specialised tools. In this section, we
present the most important characteristics of a
discourse annotation tool.
An annotation tool needs to be easy to use; with
a minimum time required to learn how it works.
It should also hide unnecessary details from the
annotator (e.g. XML tags which are not directly
linked to the task).
Usually the annotators are linguists with little or
no experience of computers or annotation schemes.
Because of this, an annotation tool has to be
designed so that humans provide the information in
a very simple and friendly way. In addition, the
tool needs to ensure that no illegal information is
introduced during the process (e.g. illegal XML
constructions, wrong values for the attributes, etc.).
Last, but not least, it is desirable that a tool can
be used for more than one task, so the annotators do
not need to learn a new tool every time the task is
changed. Moreover, in projects which build corpora
in several languages, one way to ensure consistency
between the annotations in the different languages is
by using the same tool. Therefore, it is desired that
a tool is language independent.
PALinkA, the tool presented in this paper
meets all these requirements, being appropriate for
discourse annotation.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.936902" genericHeader="method">
3 Existing annotation tools
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966757575757">
A large number of the existing annotation tools are
for specific purposes only (e.g. for coreference
(Garside and Rayson, 1997; Or˘asan, 2000), for
Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu, RSTTool)).
Due to space limits we will not refer to them. In
this section we briefly present few tools which can
be used for a wide range of annotations tasks.
Day et. al. (1998) present Alembic Workbench,
a tool developed by MITRE Corporation and
used in the MUC conferences. The tool is
highly customisable and features machine learning
algorithms which facilitate the annotation process.
Unfortunately the support seems to be discontinued
and the documentation how to use the machine
learning algorithms is sparse. When we tried to
process texts with rich annotation it became slow.
Other tools which can be used to annotate a
large range of discourse phenomena are MATE
(McKelvie et al., 2001), ATLAS (Laprun et al.,
2002) and MMAX (M¨uller and Strube, 2001).
All these tools provide advanced frameworks for
annotating text and speech, allowing customisation
according to the task. They are very powerful, but
they also require advanced computing knowledge
in order to install and take full advantage of
the facilities they provide. We consider that the
installation and customisation process needs to be
simple, so that people without much knowledge
about computers can use them.
In the next section, we present PALinkA, a tool
which requires little computing knowledge to install
and customise, and can be employed in a large
number of annotation tasks.

4 Perspicuous and Adjustable Links
Annotator (PALinkA)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941615384616">
Our corpus annotated for coreference (Mitkov et
al., 2000) was produced using Coreferential Links
Annotator (CLinkA) (Or˘asan, 2000). Even though
the tool was useful for the annotation, we noticed
that it has limitations. For example it does not allow
to annotate texts which already contained other type
of annotation and the annotation scheme it built in
the tool which means that it cannot be changed.
We started to develop PALinkA as a replacement
of CLinkA, trying to address its shortcomings. Soon
we realised that it is easy to make a multipurpose
annotation tool, which can be adjusted to the
requirements of the task, without losing its ease of
use, keeping it perspicuous.
The underlying idea of PALinkA is that it is
possible to decompose most of the annotation tasks
using three types of basic operations:
Insertion of information not explicitly marked in
the text (e.g. ellipsis, zero pronouns)
Marking of the elements in a text (e.g. noun
phrases, utterances, sentences)
Marking the links between the elements (e.g.
coreferential links)
We should emphasise that these three operation do
not correspond to only three XML tags. The number
of tags which can be inserted in a text is unlimited,
for each one being possible to specify its name and
attributes. However, for each tag it is necessary to
define the type of operation attached to it, so that the
tool will know how to handle it. For example, for
missing information the tool will insert a marker in
the text, whereas for a link it will ask the annotator to
specify the referred element. The set of tags which
can be used to annotate is loaded from a preferences
file. Figure 1 shows a small part of a preferences
file used to annotate coreference. It could look
complicated for a non-expert in computers, but its
syntax relies on a limited number of rules which are
described in the documentation.

As can be seen in Figure 2 in the main screen

text can be easily read. In order to identify the tags
present in the text, the user can specify colours to
display the annotated text and can require to have
the boundaries explicitly marked (in our example

with square brackets). PALinkA can be used to add
annotation to files which already contain some sort
of annotation. However, if the existing annotation is
not relevant for the task, it does not appear on the
screen at all.
The annotation process is kept as simple as
possible; the boundaries of tags and the links
between them being indicated with the help of the
mouse. The tags which need to be linked require a
unique ID. These IDs are generated and managed by
the program allowing the annotator to concentrate
on the annotation process. In addition to this, the
tool has all the normal operations an annotation tool
has: it can insert, delete or change tags.
The output of the program is a well-formed XML,
the tool making sure that the human annotator does
not produce invalid XML constructions. At present
the tool supports only in-line annotation, but in
the long term, we intent to offer the possibility of
producing stand-off annotation.
Given that PALinkA is implemented in Java it
is platform independent, running on any computer
with a Virtual Java Machine installed. The tool is
also language independent. In order to keep the tool
as flexible as possible, it does not has a tokeniser.
Instead, the tokens in the input text have to be
explicitly marked using XML.
Due to space restrictions, we cannot present
all the features of PALinkA and how it
operates in more detail. More information
can be found at the project’s web page:
http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/PALinkA/. At the
same address it is possible to download the tool for
free.

5 Case studies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999466">
In this section, we show how PALinkA was used to
create annotated corpora for coreference resolution,
automatic summarisation and centering theory. We
finish the section with few examples of simpler
annotation tasks where PALinkA proved useful.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996375">
5.1 Coreference annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978315789474">
Annotating coreference is a notoriously time-
consuming and labor-intensive task. In this task,
the annotators have to mark the coreferential links
between entities in a text. Usually, each entity
receives a unique ID, and a link between two
entities is marked using these IDs. These IDs are
automatically managed by PALinkA. Some of the
links refer to more than one entity. This fact can
also be encoded using the tool.
For this annotation we extended the scheme
presented in (Tutin et al., 2000). Even though this
scheme is not similar with the one used in the MUC,
it can be easily converted to the MUC scheme.
PALinkA is currently used in the Alliance Project1
to produce coreferentially annotated corpora for
English and French.
The coreferential chains can be quickly identified
by using the entities’ tree in the right hand side of
the screen (see Figure 2) or by highlighting them.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98839">
5.2 Annotation for automatic summarisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952173913043">
Automatic summarisation is not part of the discourse
analysis field, but it can use discourse information
in order to produce high quality summaries. A
corpus of news was annotated with information
useful for automatic summarisation (Hasler et al.,
2003). In addition to indicating the importance
of each sentence, we enhanced the corpus with
additional information which allows to measure the
conciseness and the coherence of summaries. In
order to be able to measure the conciseness of a
summary, we indicated in the important sentences
which parts can be removed without losing
important information. For coherence, we used
a simplified version of the coreference annotation
task. For each important sentence containing a
referential expression with the antecedent in another
sentence, we indicated the link between sentences.
As for other tasks, the tool eased the annotation
thanks to its friendly interface. In addition,
PALinkA has two features which made the task
much easier. One of these features indicates how
much of the text is marked with a certain tag. We
asked our annotators to mark 15% of the text as

<bodyText confidence="0.999665">
essential and another 15% as important. Using
PALinkA it was possible to keep these length
restrictions.
The time necessary to annotate a text was another
parameter we wanted to record. With PALinkA it is
possible to record this time. If the annotator needs to
take a break during the process, this can be indicated
by pressing the Pause button, in this way recording
the actual time required by the annotation.
The corpus annotated for automatic
summarisation is part of the Computer-Aided
Summarisation Tool (CAST) project.2
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999774">
5.3 Annotating centering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99930309375">
Centering Theory (CT) characterises the local
coherence of a text on the basis of the discourse
entities in a text and the way in which they are
introduced (Grosz et al., 1995). CT was developed
and demonstrated on simple texts. In order to test
if the theory holds for real texts and gain insights
into how the theory can be applied to them, 60
news reports and encyclopedic texts were annotated
by several annotators. The number of annotated
texts may seem small, but given the difficulty of the
annotation and the fact that six versions of Centering
Theory were marked for each text, it is impossible to
produce large corpora.
In Centering Theory the discourse consists of a
sequence of utterances. Each utterance has several
forward looking centers and at most one backward
looking center. One of the forward looking center
is called preferred center and indicates the topic of
the utterance. Due to space limits, Centering Theory
cannot be discussed here, more details can be found
in (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998).
The main difficulty when annotating centering
comes from the number of embedded tags which
have to be marked. Each utterance contains several
centers, some of these also embedding other centers.
Given this richness of tags the main advantage of
using PALinkA is that it hides the XML tags, using
colours for each tag. In addition to this, it is possible
to configure the program to mark the beginning and
end of each tag using a character chosen by the
user. This feature proved also useful for coreference
annotation. It is possible to notice it in Figure 2

where the boundaries of each NP are marked by
square brackets. The user friendly interface facilitate
the annotation process and does not distract the
annotator with technical details.

5.4 Other tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898666666667">
In addition to annotating the aforementioned
discourse phenomena, the tool was also employed
in several other simpler tasks. It proved useful to
annotate named entities in a corpus of Romanian
news, mark noun phrases, prepositional phrases
and their attachment in Romanian texts. The tool
was also used to post-edit the output of automatic
programs which identify the layout of scientific
articles (e.g. headings, footnotes, citations).

6 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973470588235">
In this paper, we briefly presented a multipurpose
annotation tool used in several of our projects
which annotated the structure of the discourse. The
tool is freely available for research purposes at
http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/projects/PALinkA/.
In the future we intend add two new features
to PALinkA. The first one will enable automating
certain tasks with the possibility of post-editing the
output of the automatic methods. We are currently
working on an API which will allow the users to
plug their modules into PALinkA. However, given
that these modules will have to be written in Java,
this function will be available only for programmers.
The second feature which we want to add to the
system is to allow annotation of cross-document
links. Such an option will prove very useful for
cross-document coreference research.

(1998) present Alembic Workbench, a tool developed by MITRE Corporation and used in the MUC conferences. The tool is highly customisable and features machine learning algorithms which facilitate the annotation process. Unfortunately the support seems to be discontinued and the documentation how to use the machine learning algorithms is sparse. When we tried to process texts with rich annotation it became slow. Other tools which can be used to annotate a large range of discourse phenomena are MATE (McKelvie et al., 2001), ATLAS (Laprun et al., 2002) and MMAX (M¨uller and Strube, 2001). All these tools provide advanced frameworks for annotating text and speech, allowing customisation according to the task. They are very powerful, but they also require advanced computing knowledge in order to install and take full advantage of the facilities they provide. We consider that the installation and customisation process needs to be simple, so that people without much knowledge about computers can use them. In the next section, we present PALinkA, a tool which requires little computing knowledge to install and customi</context>
