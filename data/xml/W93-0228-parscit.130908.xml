The TECHDOC system [ROsner, Stede 92b] is an implemented prototype
that starts from a domain knowledge base about maintenance plans, objects
and actions involved, potential hazards etc. and delivers simultaneously
generated instruction texts in - at the moment - three supported languages
(English, German and French). Our approach is best characterized as an
attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of multilingual document generation
from a kb as an alternative to MT approaches starting from a source text.
Empirical investigations: How useful is RST ?
In the analysis phase of the project we carefully worked through a cor-
pus of multilingual documents: primary focus was on automobile main-
tenance manuals. This work was supplemented by instructional texts for
other technical objects (for end consumers as well as technicians, e.g. air-
craft maintenance) , software documentation and other multilingual material
(e.g. tourist information leaflets).1
One of the issues was the question whether an RST 2 representation of
document structure could serve as intermediate, still language independent
level mediating &apos;between&apos; the knowledge base and the texts rendered in
different languages.
The answer was somewhat of a &apos;Yes, but ...&apos;. As reported in more de-
tail in [R,osner, Stede 92a] it was possible to assign identical RST analyses
to corresponding manual sections in English and German, a result again
established in recent work with the French versions. This result is not too
surprising given the fact that multilingual technical documents typically em-
anate from the (more or less adequate) translation of a completely organized
monolingual &apos;master copy&apos;.
In order to achieve this welcome &apos;parallelism&apos; some claims of RST had
to be abandoned (cf. [R6sner, Stede 92a]). One point was the question

and advertisements, cf. [Rosner, Stede 93].
2As others we see the &apos;rhetorical&apos; in RST as a misnomer (cf. e.g. [Dale, this volume])
and prefer to talk about &apos;discourse relations&apos;.

of &apos;minimal units&apos; of an R.ST analysis. Since even closely related lan-
guages differ in their realization potential or their preferred way to express
relations minimal units could no longer be chosen primarily on syntactic
grounds.3 Content that in one language is e.g. expressed in a (sub-)clanse
may preferably be expressed in a PP in another one (and vice versa):
&amp;quot;Check the coolant level in the reserve tank when the engine is at normal
operating temperature.&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Den KiihImittelstand mi Reservetank bei nor-
Dialer Betriebstemperatur.des Motors kontrollieren.&amp;quot;
Other adaptations were necessary for simultaneous analyses (cf. be-
low) and for complex interdependencies like in the following example were
RST&apos;s adjacency restrictions have to be sacrificed in order to get an
acceptable account:4 &amp;quot;[The spark plugs must be securely tightened],,,, [but
not over-tightened]8b. [A plug that&apos;s too loose],â€ž. [can get very hot]91, and
[possibly damage the engineljb,; [one that&apos;s too tight]1oa [could damage the
threads in the cylinder ht%dhob.&amp;quot;

Rhetoric in technical documents ?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992805">
If we take &apos;rhetoric&apos; in the classical sense of &apos;art of persuasion&apos; examples like
the following are rare exceptions in our corpus: &apos;The horn is actuated by
pressing the button fitted in the steering wheel spoke. As a. good driver,
your use or the horn will be minimal.&apos;
The bulk of the material is not directly addressing the reader but oriented
towards the domain and presented ill an impersonal &apos;objective&apos; style. This
is reflected in the relations that we found in the analyses. Around a dozen
of different subject-matter relations were used but only one &apos;rhetorical&apos;
relation: MOTIVATION. 6 MOTIVATION typically showed up in exam-
ples like the following where a recommendation with respect to an action
is enhanced with information about its PURPOSE. Since these relations
belong to different `metafunctions&apos; 7 we deliberately assigned them simul-
taneously: &amp;quot;Replace plugs one at a time, so you don&apos;t get the wires mixed
up.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;...Thread the new spark plug in by hand to prevent crossthreading.&amp;quot;

Intentions in technical documents ?
Technical documentation is provided on purpose: in order to fulfill legal
requirements (e.g. EC product reliability act), as a marketing aid, as a
service to the customer, etc.. In addition to such global motivations other
intentions influence the strategic and tactical decisions of &apos;What should be
communicated ?&apos; and &apos;How should this be done ?&apos;.
The primary strategic intention is &apos;ENABLEMENT to ACT&apos;. The best
way to fulfill this is to provide all information that enables the customer
to make best use of the product., to maintain or troubleshoot, it, to avoid
hazards, etc.. As a tactical issue this information shall be organized to
enhance nnderstandability and ease of access, it shall be presented in a.
concise manner, but nevertheless be complete (at least. when taking &apos;normal&apos;
inferences into account).
Some of these intentions (e.g. ease of processing and understanding) seem
to be &apos;compiled&apos; into the conventional, schematized way to organize mainte-
nance manual texts. A very obvious example is that steps to be performed
are mentioned in the texts in the order of their execution.8 Among other
aspects this allows to easily synchronize reading the text and performing
the actions; although other orders are imaginable these would demand for
explicit signalling and thus increase the effort for both writer and reader.
Discussion: Towards a unified view ?
Although [Mann and Thompson 87] report that &apos;virtually every text has an
R.ST analysis&apos; (p. 20), they frankly admit that &apos;certain text types charac-
teristically do not have RST analyses&apos;. But what, if nwrely being assigned
an RST analysis is not a. sufficient account for a. text. ?
As material for the (liscussion, see the following short paragraph from a.
DOS user guide:
Time IBM personal computer disk operating system (DOS) controls the
movement of habilitation on the computer. You can think of DOS UN a po-
liceman who directs traffic at a busy intersection. In much the sante way
DOS controls the way the coMputer uses programs, games, and applica-
tions.&amp;quot;
If one tries to analyse this paragraph in RST style one probably will have
to introduce two discourse relations that in ight be labelled a.s &amp;quot;Introduction
Another example of the relevance of domain structure, cf. [Sibun, this volume].

of an analogy&amp;quot; (indicated here on the surface by &amp;quot;You can think of ... as
...&amp;quot;) and &amp;quot;Transfer of an analogy&amp;quot; (indicated by &amp;quot;In much the same way
...&amp;quot;). No other example of the well known lists of discourse relations seems
to be adequate enough. But what would we gain from such an analysis ?
We have to look at the example from another angle: the introduction
of the analogy is functional for the writer&apos;s intention that the reader best
understands on a high level what DOS is intended for. To put it in other
words: There is no reason based on mere content to talk about DOS and to
talk about a policeman directing traffic. Only the pedagogical intentions of
making the text understandable give a. reason to make up the analogy arid
to transfer the analogy back to the main topic.
In this sense discourse relations should be interpreted as realizing under-
lying intentions and they are best discussed as a &apos;repertoire&apos; that allows to
pursue intentions. 9
