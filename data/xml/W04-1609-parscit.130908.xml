To date, there are no WSD systems for Arabic. In
this paper we present and evaluate a novel unsuper-
vised approach, SALAAM, which exploits transla-
tional correspondences between words in a parallel
Arabic English corpus to annotate Arabic text using
an English WordNet taxonomy. We illustrate that
our approach is highly accurate in of the
evaluated data items based on Arabic native judge-
ment ratings and annotations. Moreover, the ob-
tained results are competitive with state-of-the-art
unsupervised English WSD systems when evaluated
on English data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998415279411765">
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the process
of resolving the meaning of a word unambiguously
in a given natural language context. Within the
scope of this paper, it is the process of marking text
with an explicit set of sense tags or labels from some
predefined tag set. It is well established that in or-
der to obtain best quality sense annotations of words
in running text, one needs a wide coverage lexicon
and a trained lexicographer to annotate the words
manually with their appropriate senses. Such a task
is very tedious, expensive, and, by many standards,
daunting to the people involved, even when all the
required resources are available (Fellbaum et al.,
2001). The problem becomes ever more challeng-
ing when dealing with a language with virtually no
automated knowledge resources or tools. Like the
majority of natural languages, the Arabic language
happens to fall in this category of languages with
minimal automated resources.
The focus of this paper is the sense disambigua-
tion of Modern Standard Arabic which is the lan-
guage used in formal speech and writing in the Arab
world; Moreover, the script is shared with Urdu,
Farsi, Dari and Pashtu. To our knowledge, there are
no Arabic WSD systems reported in the literature.
Arabic is a Semitic language with rich templatic
morphology. An Arabic word in text or speech
may be composed of a stem, plus affixes and clitics.
The affixes include inflectional markers for tense,
gender, and/or number. The clitics include some
(but not all) prepositions, conjunctions, determin-
ers, possessive pronouns and pronouns. The stems
consist of an underlying consonantal root and a tem-
plate. The root could be anywhere from two to four
consonants devoid of vocalization. Typically text in
Modern Standard Arabic is written in the stem sur-
face form with the various affixes. However, most
Arabic dictionaries list the entries in terms of roots
rather than surface forms.
In this paper, we present an approach, SALAAM
(Sense Annotations Leveraging Alignments And
Multilinguality), to bootstrap WSD for Arabic
text presented in surface form. The approach of
SALAAM is based on work by (Diab and Resnik,
2002) but it goes beyond it in the sense of extending
the approach to the tagging of Arabic as a target lan-
guage.(Diab, 2003) SALAAM uses cross-linguistic
correspondences for characterizing word meanings
in natural language. This idea is explored by several
researchers, (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1998; Chugur
et al., 2002; Ide, 2000; Dyvik, 1998). Basically,
a word meaning or a word sense is quantifiable
as much as it is uniquely translated in some lan-
guage or set of languages. SALAAM is an em-
pirical validation of this very notion of characteriz-
ing word meaning using cross-linguistic correspon-
dences. Since automated lexical resources are vir-
tually non-existent for Arabic, SALAAM leverages
sense ambiguity resolution for Arabic off of exist-
ing English lexical resources and an Arabic English
parallel corpus, thereby providing a bilingual solu-
tion to the WSD problem.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the SALAAM system; Section 3 presents an
evaluation of the approach followed by Section 4
which discusses the chosen sense inventory in rela-
tion to the Arabic data; We conclude with a sum-
mary and some final remarks in Section 6.

2 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984633302325582">
SALAAM exploits parallel corpora for sense anno-
tation. The key intuition behind SALAAM is that
when words in one language, L1, are translated into
the same word in a second language, L2, then the
L1 words are semantically similar. For example,
when the English — L1 — words bank, broker-
age, mortgage-lender translate into the Arabic —
L2 — word bnk ( ) in a parallel corpus,&apos; where
the bank is polysemous, SALAAM discovers that
the intended sense for the English word bank is the
financial institution sense, not the geological forma-
tion sense, based on the fact that it is grouped with
brokerage and mortgage-lender. Two fundamental
observations are at the core of SALAAM:
their translation. The word Dfp ( ), in this
case, is referring to the concept of LAND BY
WATER SIDE, thereby making the correspond-
ing senses in the English words more salient.
It is important to note that the foregrounded
senses of bank and shore are not necessarily
identical, but they are quantifiably the closest
senses to one another among the various senses
of both words.
Given observations TDO and FGO, the crux
of the SALAAM approach aims to quantifiably
exploit the translator’s implicit knowledge of
sense representation cross-linguistically, in effect,
reverse engineering a relevant part of the translation
process.
Translation Distinction Observation (TDO) SALAAM’s algorithm is as follows:
Senses of ambiguous words in one language
are often translated into distinct words in a
second language.
To exemplify TDO, we consider a sentence
such as I walked by the bank, where the word
bank is ambiguous with senses. A trans-
lator may translate bank into Dfp ( ) corre-
sponding to the GEOLOGICAL FORMATION
sense or to bnk ( ) corresponding to the FI-
NANCIAL INSTITUTION sense depending on
the surrounding context of the given sentence.
Essentially, translation has distinctly differen-
tiated two of the possible senses of bank.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.916804">
Foregrounding Observation (FGO)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997669645161291">
If two or more words are translated into the
same word in a second language, then they
often share some element of meaning.
FGO may be expressed in quantifiable terms
as follows: if several words
in L1 are translated into the same word form
in L2, then share some ele-
ment of meaning which brings the correspond-
ing relevant senses for each of these words to
the foreground. For example, if the word Dfp
( ), in Arabic, translates in some instances in
a corpus to shore and other instances to bank,
then shore and bank share some meaning com-
ponent that is highlighted by the fact that the
translator chooses the same Arabic word for
&apos;We use the Buckwalter transliteration scheme for the Ara-
bic words in this paper. http://www.ldc.org/aramorph
SALAAM expects a word aligned parallel cor-
pus as input;
L1 words that translate into the same L2 word
are grouped into clusters;
SALAAM identifies the appropriate senses for
the words in those clusters based on the words
senses’ proximity in WordNet. The word sense
proximity is measured in information theo-
retic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik
(Resnik, 1999);
A sense selection criterion is applied to choose
the appropriate sense label or set of sense la-
bels for each word in the cluster;
The chosen sense tags for the words in the
cluster are propagated back to their respec-
tive contexts in the parallel text. Simultane-
ously, SALAAM projects the propagated sense
tags for L1 words onto their L2 corresponding
translations.
The focus of this paper is on the last point in the
SALAAM algorithm, namely, the sense projection
phase onto the L2 words in context. In this case, the
L2 words are Arabic and the sense inventory is the
English WordNet taxonomy. Using SALAAM we
annotate Arabic words with their meaning defini-
tions from the English WordNet taxonomy. We jus-
tify the usage of an English inventory on both em-
pirical and theoretical grounds. Empirically, there
are no automated sense inventories for Arabic; Fur-
thermore, to our knowledge the existing MRDs for
Arabic are mostly root based which introduces an-
other layer of ambiguity into Arabic processing
since Modern Standard Arabic text is rendered in
a surface form relatively removed from the under-
lying root form. Theoretically, we subscribe to the
premise that people share basic conceptual notions
which are a consequence of shared human experi-
ence and perception regardless of their respective
languages. This premise is supported by the fact
that we have translations in the first place. Accord-
ingly, basing the sense tagging of L2 words with
corresponding L1 sense tags captures this very idea
of shared meaning across languages and exploits it
as a bridge to explicitly define and bootstrap sense
tagging in L2, Arabic.

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934">
In order to formally evaluate SALAAM for Ara-
bic WSD, there are several intermediary steps.
SALAAM requires a token aligned parallel corpus
as input and a sense inventory for one of the lan-
guages of the parallel corpus. For evaluation pur-
poses, we need a manually annotated gold standard
set.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999484">
3.1 Gold Standard Set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939">
As mentioned above, there are no systems that per-
form Arabic WSD, therefore there exist no Ara-
bic gold standard sets as such. Consequently, one
needs to create a gold standard. Since SALAAM
depends on parallel corpora, an English gold stan-
dard with projected sense tags onto corresponding
Arabic words would serve as a good start. A desir-
able gold standard would be generic covering sev-
eral domains, and would exist in translation to Ara-
bic. Finding an appropriate English gold standard
that satisfies both attributes is a challenge. One op-
tion is to create a gold standard based on an exist-
ing parallel corpus such as the Quran, the Bible or
the UN proceedings. Such corpora are single do-
main corpora and/or their language is stylistic and
distant from everyday Arabic; Moreover, the cost of
creating a manual gold standard is daunting. Alter-
natively, the second option is to find an existing En-
glish gold standard that is diverse in its domain cov-
erage and is clearly documented. Fortunately, the
SENSEVAL2 exercises afford such sets.2 SENSE-
VAL is a series of community-wide exercises that
create a platform for researchers to evaluate their
WSD systems on a myriad of languages using dif-
ferent techiques by constantly defining consistent
standards and robust measures for WSD.
Accordingly, the gold standard set used here is
the set of 671 Arabic words corresponding to the
correctly sense annotated English nouns from the

achieved a precision of 64.5% and recall of 53% on
the English test set for that task. SALAAM ranks
as the best unsupervised system when compared to
state-of-the-art WSD systems on the same English
task. The English All Words task requires the WSD
system to sense tag every content word in an English
language text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99954">
3.2 Token Aligned Parallel Corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99815635">
The gold standard set corresponds to the test set
in an unsupervised setting. Therefore the test set
corpus is the SENSEVAL2 English All Words test
corpus which comprises three articles from the
Wall Street Journal discussing religious practice,
medicine and education. The test corpus does not
exist in Arabic. Due to the high expense of man-
ually creating a parallel corpus, i.e. using human
translators, we opt for automatic translation sys-
tems in a fashion similar to (Diab, 2000). To our
knowledge there exist two off the shelf English Ara-
bic Machine Translation (MT) systems: Tarjim and
Almisbar.3 We use both MT systems to translate
the test corpus into Arabic. We merge the outputs
of both in an attempt to achieve more variability
in translation as an approximation to human qual-
ity translation. The merging process is based on the
assumption that the MT systems rely on different
sources of knowledge, different dictionaries in the
least, in their translation process.
Fortunately, the MT systems produce sentence
aligned parallel corpora.4 However, SALAAM ex-
pects token aligned parallel corpora. There are sev-
eral token alignment programs available. We use the
GIZA++ package which is based on the IBM Statis-
tical MT models.5 Like most stochastic NLP appli-
cations, GIZA++ requires large amounts of data to
produce reliable quality alignments. The test corpus
is small comprising 242 lines only; Consequently,
we augment the test corpus with several other cor-
pora. The augmented corpora need to have similar
attributes to the test corpus in genre and style. The
chosen corpora and their relative sizes are listed in
Table 1.
BC-SV1 is the Brown Corpus and SENSEVAL1
trial, training and test data. SV2-LS is the SEN-
SEVAL2 English Lexical Sample trial, training and
test data. WSJ is the Wall Street Journal. Finally
SV2AW is SENSEVAL2 English All Words test
corpus.

3.3 Sense Inventory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997805818181818">
The gold standard set is annotated using the Word-
Net taxonomy, WN1.7pre, for English. Like previ-
ous WordNet editions (Fellbaum, 1998), WN17pre
is a computational semantic lexicon for English. It
is rapidly becoming the community standard lexical
resource for English since it is freely available for
academic research. It is an enumerative lexicon in
a Quillian style semantic network that combines the
knowledge found in traditional dictionaries (Quil-
lian, 1968). Words are represented as concepts, re-
ferred to as synsets, that are connected via different

types of relations such as hyponymy, hypernymy,
synonymy, meronymy, antonymy, etc. Words are
represented as their synsets in the lexicon. For ex-
ample, the word bank has 10 synsets in WN17pre
corresponding to 10 different senses. The concepts
are organized taxonomically in a hierarchical struc-
ture with the more abstract or broader concepts at
the top of the tree and the specific concepts toward
the bottom of the tree. For instance, the concept
FOOD is the hypernym of the concept FRUIT, for
instance.
Similar to previous WordNet taxonomies,
WN17pre comprises four databases for the four
major parts of speech in the English language:
nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The nouns
database consists of 69K concepts and has a depth
of 15 nodes. The nouns database is the richest of
the 4 databases. Majority of concepts are connected
via the IS-A identity relation. The focus of this
paper is exclusively on nouns.7

more than one definition for each item. Or alterna-

In this experiment, the Arabic words annotated with
English WN1.7pre tags are judged on a five point
scale metric by three native speakers of Arabic with
near native proficiency in English. The experiment
is run in a form format on the web. The raters
are asked to judge the accurateness of the chosen
sense definition from a list of definitions associated
with the translation of the Arabic word. The Ara-
bic words are given to the raters in their respective
context sentences. Therefore the task of the rater is
to judge the appropriateness of the chosen English
sense definition for the Arabic word given its con-
text. S/he is required to pick a rating from a drop
down menu for each of the data items. The five
point scale is as follows:
Accurate: This choice indicates that the cho-
sen sense definition is an appropriate meaning
definition of the Arabic word.
Approximate: This choice indicates that the
chosen sense definition is a good meaning def-
inition for the Arabic word given the context
yet there exists on the list of possible defini-
tions a more appropriate sense definition.
Misalignment: This choice indicates that the
Arabic word is not a translation of the English
word due to a misalignment or the word being
rendered in English in the Arabic sentence, i.e.
the English word was not translated by either
of the Arabic MT systems.
None: This choice indicates that none of the
sense definitions listed is an appropriate sense
definition for the Arabic word.
Wrong: This choice indicates that the chosen
sense definition is the incorrect meaning defi-
nition for the Arabic word given its context.

which is a translation of

The words srTAn ( ), meaning cancer, and

see today’s newspaper?&amp;quot;
today: the present time or
age; &amp;quot;the world of today&amp;quot;;
&amp;quot;today we have computers&amp;quot;
SALAAM chooses the first meaning definition
while the raters seem to favor the second.
None of the raters seemed to find data items
that had no corresponding meaning definition in the
given list of English meaning definitions. It is in-
teresting to note that the single item considered a
”NONE” category in experiment 1 was considered
a misalignment by the three raters.
If we calculate the average precision of the eval-
uated sense tagged Arabic words based on the total
tagged English nouns of 1071 nouns in this test set,
we obtain an absolute precision of 56.9% for Arabic
sense tagging. It is worth noting that the average
precision on the SENSEVAL2 English All Words
Task for any of the unsupervised systems is in the
lower 50% range.

4 General Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998927523809524">
It is worth noting the high agreement level between
the rating judgments of the three raters in experi-
ment 2 and the human manual annotations of ex-
periment 1. The obtained results are very encour-
aging indeed but it makes the implicit assumption
that the English WordNet taxonomy is sufficient for
meaning representation of the Arabic words used in
this text. In this section, we discuss the quality of
WN1.7pre as an appropriate sense inventory for the
Arabic task.
With that intent in mind, we evaluate the 600
word instances of Arabic that are deemed correctly
tagged using the English WN17pre.8 We investigate
three different aspects of the Arabic English corre-
spondence: Arabic and English words are equiva-
lent; Arabic words correspond to specific English
senses; And English words do not sufficiently cor-
respond to all possible senses for the Arabic word.
The three aspects are discussed in detail below.
Arabic and English words are equivalent
We observe that a majority of the ambiguous
words in Arabic are also ambiguous in English
in this test set; they preserve ambiguity in the
same manner. In Arabic, 422 word tokens cor-
responding to 190 word types, are at the closest
granularity level with their English correspon-
dent;9 For instance, all the senses of care ap-
ply to its Arabic translation EnAyA ( ); the
sense definitions are listed as follows:
– care, attention, aid,
tending: the work of
caring for or attending
to someone or something;
&amp;quot;no medical care was
required&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;the old car
needed constant attention&amp;quot;
– caution, precaution, care,
forethought: judiciousness
in avoiding harm or danger;
&amp;quot;he exercised caution in
opening the door&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;he
handled the vase with care&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9992816">
8The overlapping number of Arabic words rated ACCU-
RATE by the three annotators of experiment 1 and those ac-
curate items from experiment 1.
9This means that all the English senses listed for WN17pre
are also senses for the Arabic word.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997865139705883">
– concern, care, fear: an
anxious feeling; &amp;quot;care had
aged him&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;they hushed it
up out of fear of public
reaction&amp;quot;
– care: a cause for feeling
concern; &amp;quot;his major care
was the illness of his
wife&amp;quot;
– care, charge, tutelage,
guardianship: attention
and management implying
responsibility for safety;
&amp;quot;he is under the care of a
physician&amp;quot;
– care, maintenance, upkeep:
activity involved in
maintaining something in
good working order; &amp;quot;he
wrote the manual on car
care&amp;quot;
It is worth noting that the cases where am-
biguity is preserved in English and Arabic
are all cases where the polysemous word
exhibits regular polysemy and/or metonymy.
The instances where homonymy is preserved
are borrowings from English. Metonymy is
more pragmatic than regular polysemy (Cruse,
1986); for example, tea in English has the fol-
lowing metonymic sense from WN1.7pre:
– a reception or party at
which tea is served; &amp;quot;we
met at the Dean’s tea for

This sense of tea does not have a correspon-
dent in the Arabic $Ay ( ). Yet, the En-
glish lamb has the metonymic sense of MEAT
which exists in Arabic. Researchers building
EuroWordNet have been able to devise a num-
ber of consistent metonymic relations that hold
cross linguistically such as fabric/material, an-
imal/food, building/organization (Vossen et al.,
1999; Wim Peters and Wilks, 2001). In gen-
eral, in Arabic, these defined classes seem to
hold, however, the specific case of tea and
party does not exist. In Arabic, the English
sense would be expressed as a compound tea
party or Hflp $Ay ( ).
Arabic word equivalent to specific English
sense(s)
In this evaluation set, there are 138 instances
where the Arabic word is equivalent to a sub-
sense(s) of the corresponding English word.
The 138 instances correspond to 87 word
types. An example is illustrated by the noun
ceiling in English.
– ceiling: the overhead
upper surface of a room;
&amp;quot;he hated painting the
ceiling&amp;quot;
– ceiling: (meteorology)
altitude of the lowest
layer of clouds
– ceiling, cap: an upper
limit on what is allowed:
&amp;quot;they established a cap for
prices&amp;quot;
– ceiling: maximum altitude
at which a plane can
fly (under specified
conditions)
The correct sense tag assigned by SALAAM
to ceiling in English is the first sense, which
is correct for the Arabic translation sqf ( ).
Yet, the other 3 senses are not correct transla-
tions for the Arabic word. For instance, the
second sense definition would be translated
as rtfAE ( ) and the last sense definition
would be rendered in Arabic as Elw ( ). This
phenomenon of Arabic words corresponding
to specific English senses and not others is
particularly dominant where the English word
is homonymic. By definition, homonymy is
when two independent concepts share the same
orthographic form, in most cases, by histor-
ical accident. Homonymy is typically pre-
served between languages that share common
origins or in cases of cross-linguistic borrow-
ings. Owing to the family distance between
English and Arabic, polysemous words in Ara-
bic rarely preserve homonymy.
English word equivalent to specific Arabic
sense
40 instances, corresponding to 20 type words
in Arabic, are manually classified as more
generic concepts than their English counter-
parts. For these cases, the Arabic word is more
polysemous than the English word. For ex-
ample, the English noun experience possesses
three senses in WN17pre as listed below.
– experience: the
accumulation of knowledge
or skill that results
from direct participation
in events or activities;
&amp;quot;a man of experience&amp;quot;;
&amp;quot;experience is the best
teacher&amp;quot;
– experience: the content
of direct observation
or participation in an
event; &amp;quot;he had a religious
experience&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;he recalled
the experience vividly&amp;quot;
– experience: an event as
apprehended; &amp;quot;a surprising
experience&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;that painful
experience certainly got
our attention&amp;quot;
All three senses are appropriate meanings of
the equivalent Arabic word tjrbp ( ) but
they do not include the SCIENTIFIC EXPERI-
MENT sense covered by the Arabic word.
From the above points, we find that 63.9% of the
ambiguous Arabic word types evaluated are concep-
tually equivalent to their ambiguous English trans-
lations. This finding is consistent with the obser-
vation of EuroWordNet builders. Vossen, Peters,
and Gonzalo (1999) find that approximately 44-
55% of ambiguous words in Spanish, Dutch and
Italian have relatively high overlaps in concept and
the sense packaging of polysemous words (Vossen
et al., 1999). 29.3% of the ambiguous Arabic words
correspond to specific senses of their English trans-
lations and 6.7% of the Arabic words are more
generic than their English correspondents.

We presented, SALAAM, a method for bootstrap-
ping the sense disambiguation process for Ara-
bic texts using an existing English sense inven-
tory leveraging translational correspondence be-
tween Arabic and English. SALAAM achieves an
absolute precision of 56.9% on the task for Ara-
bic. Of the 673 correctly tagged English tokens
for the SENSEVAL2 English All Words Task, ap-
proximately 90% of the Arabic data is deemed cor-
rectly tagged by 3 native speakers of Arabic. There-
fore, SALAAM is validated as a very good first ap-
proach to Arabic WSD. Moreover, we perform a
preliminary investigation with very promising re-
sults into the quality of the English sense inventory,
WN1.7pre, as an approximation to an Arabic sense
inventory.

In this paper we present and evaluate a novel unsupervised approach, SALAAM, which exploits translational correspondences between words in a parallel Arabic English corpus to annotate Arabic text using an English WordNet taxonomy. We illustrate that our approach is highly accurate in of evaluated data items based on Arabic native judgement ratings and annotations. Moreover, the obtained results are competitive with state-of-the-art unsupervised English WSD systems when evaluated on English data.</abstract>

Therefore the test set corpus is the SENSEVAL2 English All Words test corpus which comprises three articles from the Wall Street Journal discussing religious practice, medicine and education. The test corpus does not exist in Arabic. Due to the high expense of manually creating a parallel corpus, i.e. using human translators, we opt for automatic translation systems in a fashion similar to (Diab, 2000). To our knowledge there exist two off the shelf English Arabic Machine Translation (MT) systems: Tarjim and Almisbar.3 We use both MT systems to translate the test corpus into Arabic. We merge the outputs of both in an attempt to achieve more variability in translation as an approximation to human quality translation. The merging process is based on the assumption that the MT systems rely on different sources of knowledge, different dictionaries in the least, in their translation process. Fortunately, the MT systems produce sentence aligned parallel corpora.4 However, SALAAM expects token ali</context>

Within the scope of this paper, it is the process of marking text with an explicit set of sense tags or labels from some predefined tag set. It is well established that in order to obtain best quality sense annotations of words in running text, one needs a wide coverage lexicon and a trained lexicographer to annotate the words manually with their appropriate senses. Such a task is very tedious, expensive, and, by many standards, daunting to the people involved, even when all the required resources are available (Fellbaum et al., 2001). The problem becomes ever more challenging when dealing with a language with virtually no automated knowledge resources or tools. Like the majority of natural languages, the Arabic language happens to fall in this category of languages with minimal automated resources. The focus of this paper is the sense disambiguation of Modern Standard Arabic which is the language used in formal speech and writing in the Arab world; Moreover, the script is shared with Urdu, Farsi, Dari and Pashtu.

The word sense proximity is measured in information theoretic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik (Resnik, 1999); A sense selection criterion is applied to choose the appropriate sense label or set of sense labels for each word in the cluster; The chosen sense tags for the words in the cluster are propagated back to their respective contexts in the parallel text. Simultaneously, SALAAM projects the propagated sense tags for L1 words onto their L2 corresponding translations. The focus of this paper is on the last point in the SALAAM algorithm, namely, the sense projection phase onto the L2 words in context. In this case, the L2 words are Arabic and the sense inventory is the English WordNet taxonomy. Usi</context>

From the above points, we find that 63.9% of the ambiguous Arabic word types evaluated are conceptually equivalent to their ambiguous English translations. This finding is consistent with the observation of EuroWordNet builders. Vossen, Peters, and Gonzalo (1999) find that approximately 44- 55% of ambiguous words in Spanish, Dutch and Italian have relatively high overlaps in concept and the sense packaging of polysemous words (Vossen et al., 1999). 29.3% of the ambiguous Arabic words correspond to specific senses of their English translations and 6.7% of the Arabic words are more generic than their English correspondents. 5 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Philip Resnik and Daniel Jurafsky for their insightful comments.
