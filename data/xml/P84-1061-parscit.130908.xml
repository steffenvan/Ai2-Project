<bodyText confidence="0.997370306818182">
The paper characterizes natural lang-
uage inferencing in the TIBA0 method of
question-answering, focussin4 on three asp-
ects: (i) specification of the structures
on which the inference rules operate, (ii)
classification of the rules that have been
formulated and implemented up to now,
according to the kind of modification of
the input structure the rules invoke, and
(iii) discussion of some points in which
a prorerly designed inference procedure
may help the searca of the answer, and
vice versa.
I SPECIFICATION or THE IapuT STRUCTURES
FOR INFERENCIN1
A. Outline of the TIBA2 Method
Ihen the TIBA (text-and-inference
based answering of auestions) project was
designed, main emphasis was laid on the
automatic build-up of the stock of know-
ledge from the (non-pre-edited) input text.
The experimental system based on this meth-
od converses automatically the natural
language input (both the questions and new
pieces of information, i.e. Czech sentences
in their usual form) into the representat-
ions of meaning (tectogrammatical repres-
entations, TR s); these TR-s serve as input
structures for the inference procedure that
enriches the set of TR-s selected by the
system itself as possibly relevant for an
answer to the input question. In this en-
riched set suitable TR-s for direct and in-
direct answers to the given question are
retrieved, and then transfered by a synth-
esis procedure into the output (surface)
form if sentences (for an outline of the
method as such, see Haji6ova, 1970;- Jaji6o-
vd and Sgall, 1931; Sgall, 1982).
B. I&apos;hat Kind of Structure Inferences :Mould
Be Based on
To decide what kind of structures the
inference procedure should operate, one has
to take into account several criteria, some
of which seemingly contradict each other:
the structures should be as simple and
transparent as possible, so that inferenc-
ing can be perforiaed in a well-defined way,
and at the same time, these structures
Jhould be as°expressivenas the natural lang-
uage sentences are, not to lose any piece
of information captured by the text.
&amp;quot;atural language has a major draw-
back in its ambiguity: when a listener is
told that the criticism of the Polish del-
egate was fully justified, one does not
know (unless indicated by the context or
situation) whether s/he should infer that
someone criticized the Polisn delegate, or
whether the Polish delegate criticized
someone/something. On the other hand, there
are means in natural language that are not
preserved by most languages that logicians.
have used for drawing consequences, but
that are critical for the latter to be
drawn correctly: when a listener is told
that Russian is spoken in SIBERIA, s/he
draws conclusions partly different from
those when s/he is told that in Siberia,
AlESIAN is spoken (caoitals denotina the
intonation center); or, to borrow one of
the widely discussed examoles in linguist-
ic writings, if one hears that Joan called
&apos;Iary a 7=7LICAN and that then she insult-
ed LIM, one should infer that the speaker
considers &amp;quot;heing a Rpoublican- an insult;
this is not the case, if the speaker said
that then she INSULTED him.
These and similar considerations have
led the authors of TinAn to a strong con-
viction that the structures representing
knowledge and serving as the base for in-
ferencing in a cuestion-answering system
with a natural language interface should
he linguistically based: they should he de-
prived of all ambiguities of natural lang-
uage and at the same tivie they should pre-
serve all the information relevant for

uage sentences encompass. The exrerimental

Haji.::ova and 1)3J ).
C. rectoqrammatical Zeoresentations
One of the basic tenets of 73J is
the articulation of the semantic relation,
i.e. the relation between sound and mean-
ing, into a hierarchy of levels, connected
with the rolativization of the relation of
&apos;form&amp;quot; and &apos;function as known from tae
writin,is of ?rague ,:chool scholars. This
relativilation .Lakes it possible to dist-
ineuish two levels of sentence structure:
the level of surface syntax and ehit of
the underlying or tectogrammatical struct-
ure of sentences.
As for a formal specification of the
comolex unit of this level, that is the
the present version (see ].;itek, goall
and Sgall, in press) w_)rks with the notion
of basic dependency structure ()c:) which
is defined as a structure over the alpha-
bet A (corresoonding to toe labels of nod-
es) and the set of symools C (corresoond-
ing_to the labels of edgos). The set of
LDf:&apos; s is the set of the tectogrammatical
reoresentations of sentences containing
no coordinated structures. The BDS&apos;s are
generated by the _grammar q =,r (v ,v_,s,a),
&amp;quot;
where VT = A u C, A = ntw, a is
in-
terpreted as a lexical unit, g is a vari-
aPle standing for t and E (contextually
bound and non-bound, reJpecLively) ana 6,A
is interoreted as a set of grammatemas &apos;be-
longing to a; C is a set of comolementat-
ions (c e C, where c is an inte“er denot-
ing a certain type of compler-entation,
called a functor),C- denotes the set
(&lt;:, &gt;, c &gt;c ) for every c C.
To represent coordination, the form-
al apparatus for sentence generation is to
be complemented by another alphabet
-here ge0 is interorete,1 as tyoes of
coordination (conjuncive, disjunctive, ad-
versative, ..., apposition) , and by a new
kinu of brackets denoting the boundary of
coordinated structures; Y::{C, Jr1 for
every q e The structures gener4ted oy
the grammar are then called comolex depend-
ency structures (CD).
Coming back to the notions of elem-
entary and complex units of the tecto-
grammatical level, we can say that the
complex unit of the TR is the complex de-
pendency structure as briefly characteriz-
ed above, while the elementary units are
the symbols of the shaoes a, g, c, o, the
elements of 3-t, and tne parentheses. The
lexical units a are conceiv,.2u of as elem-
entary rather than complex, since for the
time being we do not work with any kind of
lexical dr!co-oosition. .:Ifery lexical unit
is assigned the beaters contextually
bound&apos; or &apos;non-bound . The set of grammat-
emas 3rt covers a ide ranee of :.)henomana;
they can be classified into two groups.
Grammatemes representing morphological
maanin7 in the narrow sense are specific
for different (semantic) word classes: for
nouns, we distinguish grammatemes of num-
ber ani of delimitation (indefinite, def-
inite, specifying):for adjectives and ad-
verbs, grammatemes of degree, for verbs,
we work with grammatemes of aspect (pro-
cessual, complex, resultative), iterative-
ness (iterative, non-iterative), tense
(simultaneous, anterior, posterior), im-
mediateness (immediate, non-immediate),
predicate modality (indicative, possibil-
itive, necessitive, voluntative), assert-
ive modality (affirmative, negative), and
sentential modality (declarative, inter-
rogative, imperative). The other group of
grammatemes is not - with some exceptions -
word-class specific and similarly as the
set of the types of complementations is
closely connected with the kinds of the
dependency relations between the governor
and the dependent node; thus the Locative
is accompanied by one member of the set
{in, on, under, between, ...}.
The dependency relations are very
rich and varied, and it is no wonder that
there were many efforts to classify them.
In FGD, a -lear boundary is being made be-
tween m.rticipants (deep cases) and(free)
modifications: participants are those com-
plementations that can occur with the same
verb token only once and that have to be
specified for each verb (and similarly for
each noun, adjective, etc.), while free
modifications are those complementations
that may appear more than once with the
same verb token and that can be listed for
all the verbs once for all; for a more
detailed discussion and the use of operat-
ional criteria for this classification,
see ?auevova 1974; 1980; Eaji6ov4 and
?anevovd, in press; Haji6ovi, 197; 1983.
7;oth earticipants and modifications can
be (semantically) optional or obligatory;
1-xpth optional and obligatory narticipants
are to be stated in the case frames of
verbs, while modifications belong there
only with such verbs with which they are
obligatory.
In the oresent version of FGT&amp;quot;), the
following five participants are disting-
uished: actor/bearer, patient (objective),
addressee, origin, and effect. The list
of modifications is by far richer and more
differentiated; a good starting point for
this differentiation can be found in Czech
grammars (esp. fmilauer, 1947). Thus one
can arrive at the following groupings:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989203125">
(a) local: where, direction, which way,

(d) manner: manner, regard, extent, norm

benefit, comparison.
In our discussion on types of complementat-
ions we have up to now concentrated on comp-
lementations of verbs; with the FGD frame-
work, however, all word classes have their
frames. Specific to nouns (cf. PiEha, 1930),
there is the partitive participant (a glass
of water) and the free modifications of
appurtenance (a leg of the table), of gen-
eral relationshin (nice weather), of ident-
ity (the city of Prague) and of a descript-
ive attribute (golden Prague).
To illustrate the structure of the re-
presentation on the tectogrammatical level
of FG;), we present in Fig. 1 a complex de-
pendency structure of one of the readings of
of the sentence &amp;quot;liefore the war began,
Charles lived in PRAGUE and Jane in EFRLIN&amp;quot;
(which it has in common with &apos;Before the be-
ginning of the war, Charles lived in PRAGUE
and Jane lived in DERLIN&apos;);to make the
graph easier to survey, we omit there the
values of the grammatemes.

The inference rules are programmed
in 2-1anguage (Colmerauer, 1982,) which
provides rules that carry out transfornat,
ions of oriented graphs. Since the struct-
ures accepted by the rules must not con-
tain complex labels, every complex symbol
labelling a nose in TR s has the form of a
whole subtree in the 2-language notation
(in a 2-tree).
The set of TR-s constitutes a seman-
tic network, in which the individual TR-s
are connected into a complex whole by
means of pointers between the occurrences
of lexical units and the corresponding
entries in the lexicon. (fluestions of dif-
ferent objects of the same hind referred
to in different TR -s will be handled only
in the future experiments.)

A. The Retrieval Procedure
Thd retrieval of an answer in the en-
riched set of assertions (TR s) is perform-
ed in the following steps!
(a) first it is checked whether the
lexical value of the root of the TR is id-
entical with that of the TR of the question;
if the question has the form &amp;quot;What is per-
formed (done, carried out) by X?&amp;quot;, then
the TR from the enriched set must include
an action verb as a label of its root;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9129684">
(b) the path leading from the root to the
wh-word is checked (yes-no questions are ,
excluded from the first stage of our exper-
iments); the rightmost path in the relevant
TR must coincide with the wh-path in its
lexical labels, contextual boundness,
grammatemes and functors (with some poss-
ible deviations determined by conditions
of substitutability: Singular - Plural,
Manner - Accompaniment, etc.); the wh-word
in the question must be matched by a lex-
ical unit of the potential answer, where
the latter may be further expanded;
(c) if also the rest of the two compared
TR s meet the conditions of identity or
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997771319148936">
substituttbility, the relevant TR is mark-
ed as a full answer to the given question;
if this is not the case but at least one
of the nodes depending on a node included
in the wh-path meets these conditions, then
the relevant TR is marked as an indirect
(partial) answer.
B. Towards an Effective Application of
Inference Rules
In the course of the experiments it
soon became clear that even with a very
limited number of inference rules the mem-
ory space was rapidly exceeded. It was
then necessary to find a way how to achie-
ve an effective application of the inferen-
ce rules and at the same time not to re-
strict the choice of relevant answers.
Among other things, the following issues
should be taken into consideration:
The rules substituting subtrees for
subtrees are used rather frequently, as
well as those substituting only a label
of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one ele-
ment of the complex symbol in the CDS),
preserving the overall structure of the
tree untouched. These rules operate in
both directions, so that it appears as use-
ful to use in such cases a similar strat-
egy as with synonymous expressions, i.e.
to decide on a single representation both
in the TR of the question and that includ-
ed in the stock of knowledge; this would
lead to an important decrease of the num-
ber of TR&apos;s that undergo further inference
transformations.
Only those TR&apos;s are selected for the
final steps of the retrieval of the answer
(see point (a) in III.A) that coincide
with the TR of the question in the lexical
label of the root, i.e. the main verb. If
the inference rules are ordered in such a
way that the rules changing an element of
the label of the root are applied before
the rest of the rules, then the first
step of the retrieval procedure can be
made before the application of other in-
ference rules. This again leads to a con-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993306">
295
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761085714286">
siderable reduction of the number of TR-s
on which the rest of the inference rules
are applied; only such TR-s are left in the
stock of relevant TR s
Ci) that agree with the TR of the question
in the label of the root (its lexical lab-
el may belong to superordinated or subord-
inated lexical values: device - amplifier,
etc.),
(ii) that irclude the lexical label of
the root oc the question in some other
place than at the root of the relevant
TR,
(iii) if the question has the form &amp;quot;Which
N ...&amp;quot;, (i.e. the wh-node depends on its
head in the relation of general relation-
ship), then also those TR-s are preserved
that contain an identical N node (noun)
on any level of the tree.
The use of Q-language brings about
one difficulty, namely that the rules
have to be formulated for each level for
the tree separately. It is possible to
avoid this complication by a simple tempor-
ary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which re-
sults in a tree in which all nodes with
lexical labels are on the same level; the
rules for a substitution of the lexical
labels can be then applied in one step,
after which the tree is returned into
its original shape.
These and similar considerations have
led us to the following ordering of the in-
dividual steps of the inference and retrie-
val procedure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981010944444444">
1. application of rules transforming
the input structure to such an extent that
the lexical label of the root of the tree
is not preserved in the tree of a potent-
ial answer;
2. a partial retrieval of the answer
according to the root of the tree;
3. application of rules substituting
other labels pertinent to the root of the
tree;
4. partial retrieval of the answer
according to the root of the tree;
5. application of inference rules
operating on a single tree;
6. application of inference rules
operating on two trees;
7. the steps (b) and (c) from the
retrieval of the answer (see III.A above).

<abstract confidence="0.994966368421053">The paper characterizes natural language inferencing in the TIBA0 method of question-answering, focussin4 on three aspects: (i) specification of the structures on which the inference rules operate, (ii) classification of the rules that have been formulated and implemented up to now, according to the kind of modification of the input structure the rules invoke, and (iii) discussion of some points in which a prorerly designed inference procedure may help the searca of the answer, and vice versa. SPECIFICATION FOR INFERENCIN1 A. Outline of the TIBA2 Method Ihen the TIBA (text-and-inference based answering of auestions) project was designed, main emphasis was laid on the automatic build-up of the stock of knowledge from the (non-pre-edited) input text. The experimental system based on this method converses automatically the natural language input (both the questions and new of information, Czech sentences in their usual form) into the representations of meaning (tectogrammatical repress); these serve as input structures for the inference procedure that the set of selected by the system itself as possibly relevant for an answer to the input question. In this enset suitable for direct and indirect answers to the given question are retrieved, and then transfered by a synthesis procedure into the output (surface) form if sentences (for an outline of the</abstract>

<title confidence="0.452248">I&apos;hat Kind of Structure Inferences:Mould Be Based on</title>
<abstract confidence="0.992021039783003">To decide what kind of structures the inference procedure should operate, one has to take into account several criteria, some of which seemingly contradict each other: the structures should be as simple and transparent as possible, so that inferencing can be perforiaed in a well-defined way, and at the same time, these structures the natural language sentences are, not to lose any piece of information captured by the text. &amp;quot;atural language has a major drawback in its ambiguity: when a listener is told that the criticism of the Polish delegate was fully justified, one does not (unless indicated the context or situation) whether s/he should infer that someone criticized the Polisn delegate, or whether the Polish delegate criticized someone/something. On the other hand, there are means in natural language that are not preserved by most languages that logicians. have used for drawing consequences, but that are critical for the latter to be drawn correctly: when a listener is told that Russian is spoken in SIBERIA, s/he conclusions different from those when s/he is told that in Siberia, AlESIAN is spoken (caoitals denotina the intonation center); or, to borrow one of the widely discussed examoles in linguistic writings, if one hears that Joan called &apos;Iary a 7=7LICAN and that then she insulted LIM, one should infer that the speaker &amp;quot;heing a an insult; is not the case, if the speaker that then she INSULTED him. These and similar considerations have led the authors of TinAn to a strong conviction that the structures representing knowledge and serving as the base for inferencing in a cuestion-answering system with a natural language interface should he linguistically based: they should he deprived of all ambiguities of natural langand at the same tivie they preserve all the information relevant for drawing conclusions that the natural language sentences encompass. The exrerimental based on TISACe was carried out by the group of formal linguistics at Charles University, Prague (impltmented on 1040 com:suter, compatible with IF,A works with representations of meaning (te- TR sd worked out in the framework of functional generative Jescrintion, or &amp;quot;GI) (for the linguistic Packground of this approach we refer to ;.ja.11, 1:64; et 291 Haji.::ova and 1)3J ). C. rectoqrammatical Zeoresentations One of the basic tenets of 73J is the articulation of the semantic relation, i.e. the relation between sound and meaning, into a hierarchy of levels, connected with the rolativization of the relation of &apos;form&amp;quot; and &apos;function as known from tae of ?rague ,:chool scholars. This relativilation .Lakes it possible to distineuish two levels of sentence structure: the level of surface syntax and ehit of the underlying or tectogrammatical structsentences. As for a formal specification of the comolex unit of this level, that is the present version (see ].;itek, and Sgall, in press) w_)rks with the notion of basic dependency structure ()c:) which is defined as a structure over the alphabet A (corresoonding to toe labels of nodes) and the set of symools C (corresoonding_to the labels of edgos). The set of LDf:&apos; s is the set of the tectogrammatical reoresentations of sentences containing no coordinated structures. The BDS&apos;s are by the _grammar (v ,v_,s,a), &amp;quot; = A u C, A = a interpreted as a lexical unit, g is a variaPle standing for t and E (contextually and non-bound, reJpecLively) ana is interoreted as a set of grammatemas &apos;belonging to a; C is a set of comolementat- (c where c is an inte“er denoting a certain type of compler-entation, a denotes the set &gt;, c) for every c C. To represent coordination, the formal apparatus for sentence generation is to be complemented by another alphabet interorete,1 as tyoes of coordination (conjuncive, disjunctive, adversative, ..., apposition) , and by a new kinu of brackets denoting the boundary of structures; Y::{C, for every q e The structures gener4ted oy the grammar are then called comolex dependency structures (CD). Coming back to the notions of elementary and complex units of the tectogrammatical level, we can say that the complex unit of the TR is the complex dependency structure as briefly characterized above, while the elementary units are the symbols of the shaoes a, g, c, o, the of and tne parentheses. The units a are of as elementary rather than complex, since for the being not work with any kind of lexical dr!co-oosition. .:Ifery lexical unit is assigned the beaters contextually bound&apos; or &apos;non-bound . The set of grammat- 3rt covers a ide ranee of they can be classified into two groups. Grammatemes representing morphological maanin7 in the narrow sense are specific for different (semantic) word classes: for nouns, we distinguish grammatemes of number ani of delimitation (indefinite, definite, specifying):for adjectives and adverbs, grammatemes of degree, for verbs, we work with grammatemes of aspect (processual, complex, resultative), iterativeness (iterative, non-iterative), tense (simultaneous, anterior, posterior), immediateness (immediate, non-immediate), predicate modality (indicative, possibilitive, necessitive, voluntative), assertive modality (affirmative, negative), and sentential modality (declarative, interrogative, imperative). The other group of grammatemes is not with some exceptions word-class specific and similarly as the set of the types of complementations is closely connected with the kinds of the dependency relations between the governor and the dependent node; thus the Locative is accompanied by one member of the set {in, on, under, between, ...}. The dependency relations are very and varied, and it is no that there were many efforts to classify them. In FGD, a -lear boundary is being made between m.rticipants (deep cases) and(free) participants are those comthat occur with the verb token only once and that have to be specified for each verb (and similarly for each noun, adjective, etc.), while free modifications are those complementations may appear more once with the same verb token and that can be listed for the verbs once for all; for a and the use of operational criteria for this classification, see ?auevova 1974; 1980; Eaji6ov4 and ?anevovd, in press; Haji6ovi, 197; 1983. 7;oth earticipants and modifications can optional or obligatory; optional and obligatory narticipants are to be stated in the case frames of verbs, while modifications belong there only with such verbs with which they are obligatory. In the oresent version of FGT&amp;quot;), the following five participants are distinguished: actor/bearer, patient (objective), addressee, origin, and effect. The list modifications is far richer and more differentiated; a good starting point for this differentiation can be found in Czech grammars (esp. fmilauer, 1947). Thus one can arrive at the following groupings: (a) local: where, direction, which way, (b) tem7Ncral: when, since when, till when, how long, for how long, luring, (c) causal: cause, condition real and unreal, aim, concession, consequence, (d) manner: manner, regard, extent, norm (criterion), substitution, accompaniment, means (instrument), difference, 292 benefit, comparison. In our discussion on types of complementations we have up to now concentrated on complementations of verbs; with the FGD framework, however, all word classes have their frames. Specific to nouns (cf. PiEha, 1930), there is the partitive participant (a glass of water) and the free modifications of appurtenance (a leg of the table), of general relationshin (nice weather), of identity (the city of Prague) and of a descriptive attribute (golden Prague). To illustrate the structure of the representation on the tectogrammatical level of FG;), we present in Fig. 1 a complex dependency structure of one of the readings of of the sentence &amp;quot;liefore the war began, Charles lived in PRAGUE and Jane in EFRLIN&amp;quot; (which it has in common with &apos;Before the beginning of the war, Charles lived in PRAGUE and Jane lived in DERLIN&apos;);to make the graph easier to survey, we omit there the values of the grammatemes.

(a) first it is checked whether the lexical value of the root of the TR is identical with that of the TR of the question; if the question has the form &amp;quot;What is performed (done, carried out) by X?&amp;quot;, then the TR from the enriched set must include an action verb as a label of its root; (b) the path leading from the root to the wh-word is checked (yes-no questions are , excluded from the first stage of our experiments); the rightmost path in the relevant TR must coincide with the wh-path in its lexical labels, contextual boundness, grammatemes and functors (with some possible deviations determined by conditions of substitutability: Singular - Plural, Manner - Accompaniment, etc.); the wh-word in the question must be matched by a lexical unit of the potential answer, where the latter may be further expanded; (c) if also the rest of the two compared TR s meet the conditions of identity or substituttbility, the relevant TR is marked as a full answer to the given question; if this is not the case but at least one of the nodes depending on a node included in the wh-path meets these conditions, then the relevant TR is marked as an indirect (partial) answer. an Application of Inference Rules In the course of the experiments it soon became clear that even with a very limited number of inference rules the memory space was rapidly exceeded. It was then necessary to find a way how to achieve an effective application of the inference rules and at the same time not to restrict the choice of relevant answers. Among other things, the following issues should be taken into consideration: The rules substituting subtrees for subtrees are used rather frequently, as well as those substituting only a label of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one element of the complex symbol in the CDS), preserving the overall structure of the tree untouched. These rules operate in both directions, so that it appears as useful to use in such cases a similar strategy as with synonymous expressions, i.e. to decide on a single representation both in the TR of the question and that included in the stock of knowledge; this would lead to an important decrease of the number of TR&apos;s that undergo further inference transformations. Only those TR&apos;s are selected for the final steps of the retrieval of the answer (see point (a) in III.A) that coincide with the TR of the question in the lexical label of the root, i.e. the main verb. If the inference rules are ordered in such a way that the rules changing an element of the label of the root are applied before the rest of the rules, then the first step of the retrieval procedure can be made before the application of other inrules. This again leads to a con- 295 reduction of the number of on which the rest of the inference rules applied; only such are left in the stock of relevant TR s Ci) that agree with the TR of the question in the label of the root (its lexical label may belong to superordinated or subordinated lexical values: device amplifier, etc.), (ii) that irclude the lexical label of the root oc the question in some other place than at the root of the relevant TR, (iii) if the question has the form &amp;quot;Which N ...&amp;quot;, (i.e. the wh-node depends on its head in the relation of general relationthen also those are preserved that contain an identical N node (noun) on any level of the tree. The use of Q-language brings about one difficulty, namely that the rules have to be formulated for each level for the tree separately. It is possible to avoid this complication by a simple temporary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which results in a tree in which all nodes with lexical labels are on the same level; the rules for a substitution of the lexical labels can be then applied in one step, after which the tree is returned into its original shape. These and similar considerations have led us to the following ordering of the individual steps of the inference and retrieval procedure: 1. application of rules transforming the input structure to such an extent that the lexical label of the root of the tree is not preserved in the tree of a potential answer; 2. a partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 3. application of rules substituting other labels pertinent to the root of the tree; 4. partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 5. application of inference rules operating on a single tree; 6. application of inference rules operating on two trees; 7. the steps (b) and (c) from the retrieval of the answer (see III.A above).

In this enriched set suitable TR-s for direct and indirect answers to the given question are retrieved, and then transfered by a synthesis procedure into the output (surface) form if sentences (for an outline of the method as such, see Haji6ova, 1970;- Jaji6ovd and Sgall, 1931; Sgall, 1982). B. I&apos;hat Kind of Structure Inferences :Mould Be Based on To decide what kind of structures the inference procedure should operate, one has to take into account several criteria, some of which seemingly contradict each other: the structures should be as simple and transparent as possible, so that inferencing can be perforiaed in a well-defined way, and at the same time, these structures Jhould be as°expressivenas the natural language sentences are, not to lose any piece of information captured by the text. &amp;quot;atural language has a major drawback in its ambiguity: when a listener is told that th</context>
