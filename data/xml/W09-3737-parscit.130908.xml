<bodyText confidence="0.9999015">
The goal of the research described here is to automate the recognition of con-
notative meaning in text using a range of linguistic and non-linguistic fea-
tures. Pilot results are used to illustrate the potential of an integrated multi-
disciplinary approach to semantic text analysis that combines cognitive-
oriented human subject experimentation with Machine Learning (ML) based
Natural Language Processing (NLP). The research presented here was funded
through the Advanced Question and Answering for Intelligence (AQUAINT)
Project of the U.S. federal government’s Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity (IARPA) Office. Funded as an exploratory ”Blue Sky”
project, this award enabled us to develop an extensible experimental setup
and to make progress towards training a machine learning system.
Automated understanding of connotative meaning of text requires an
understanding of both the mechanics of text and the human behaviors in-
volved in the disambiguation of text. We glean more from text than what
can be explicitly parsed from parts of speech or named entities. There are
other aspects of meaning that humans take away from text, such as a sincere
apology, an urgent request for help, a serious warning, or a perception of
personal threat. Merging cognitive and social cognitive psychology research
with sophisticated machine learning could extend current NLP systems to
account for these aspects. Building on current natural language processing
research [?], this pilot project encapsulates an end-to-end research method-
ology that begins by 1) establishing a human-understanding baseline for
the distinction between connotative and denotative meaning, 2) then ex-
tends the analysis of the mechanics of literal versus non-literal meaning by

mulative results to feed a machine learning system that will be taught to
recognize the potential for connotative meaning at the sentence level, across
a much broader corpus. This paper describes the preliminary iteration of
this methodology and suggests ways that this approach could be improved

2 Analytic framework: A cognitive approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989782608696">
We view an excerpt of text to be a stimulus, albeit much more complex than
most stimuli used in typical psychological experiments. The meaning of any
excerpt of text is tieds to a constructive cognitive process that is heavily
influenced by previous experience and cues, or features, embedded within
the text. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of (1) what features are
attended to when the text is being interpreted, (2) which of these features
are most salient and (3) how these features affect connotative meaning.
One’s ability to derive connotative meaning from text is behavior that
is learned, becoming intuitive in much the same way an individual learns
any skill or behavior. When this process of attending and learning is re-
peated across instances, specific skills become more automatic, or reliable
[?, ?]. This process is considered to be constructive and episodic in nature,
yet heavily dependent upon ”cues” that work to draw or focus one’s atten-
tion [?]. Further, research on communities suggests that the meaning of an
artifact (e.g., a specific excerpt of text) is heavily influenced by how it is
used in practice [?] The meaning of text is constructed in a similar manner.
Members of a speech community tend to make similar assumptions, or in-
ferences. The mechanics of making such inferences are scaled to the amount
of contextual information provided. Our preliminary research suggests that
when presented with a sentence that is out of context an individual seem-
ingly makes assumptions about one or all of the following: who created the
text, the context from which it was pulled and the intended meaning given
the features of the text.

3 Methods

3.1 Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
Blog text was used as the corpus for this research. Sentences were deemed
the most practical and fruitful unit of analysis because words were consid-

ered too restrictive and pieces of text spanning more than one sentence too
unwieldy. A single sentence presented enough context while still allowing
for a wide range of interpretation. Sentences were randomly selected from
a pool of texts automatically extracted from blogs, using a crawler set with
keywords such as ”oil”, ”Middle East” or ”Iraq.” Topics were selected with
the intention of narrowing the range of vocabulary used in order to aid the
machine learning experiments.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999398">
3.2 Preliminary phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998315789474">
To start, we conducted a series of eight semi-structured, face-to-face inter-
views. Individuals were presented with 20 sentences selected to include some
texts that were expected to be perceived as highly connotative as well as
some expected to be perceived as highly denotative. Each interviewee was
asked to exhaustively share all possible meanings they could derive from
the stimulus text, while also pinpointing what it was about the text that
led them to make their conclusions. Based on these interviews, we modified
our probes slightly and moved the human evaluation process to an open-
ended, on-line instrument in order to increase the number of responses. We
presented a series of 20 sentences to participants (N=193) and, for each stim-
ulus text, asked: 1) ”What does this sentence suggest?” &amp; ”What makes
you think this?”; and 2) ”What else does this sentence suggest?” &amp; ”What
makes you think this?” Upon analysis of the responses, we found that while
interpretations of the text were relatively idiosyncratic, how people allocated
their attention was more consistent. Most people tended to be making as-
sumptions about the (1) author (addressing who created the artifact), (2)
context (addressing from where the sentence was taken) and/or (3) intended
meaning of the words. We interpreted this to mean that these three areas
were potentially important for identifying inferred meanings of texts.

3.3 Design of pilot experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934875">
Next, our efforts focused on designing a reusable and scalable online evalu-
ation tool that would allow us to systematically gather multiple judgments
for each sentence using a much larger pool of stimulus text. Scaling up the
human evaluations also allowed us to decipher between responses that were
either systematically patterned or more idiosyncratic (or random). Accord-
ing to our forced-choice design, each online participant was presented with
a series of 32 pairs of sentences, one pair at a time, and asked to identify the
sentence that provided more of an opportunity to read between the lines.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994717">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965625">
Half the participants were presented with a positive prompt (which sentence
provides the most opportunity) and half were presented with a negative
prompt (which sentence provides the least opportunity). Positive/negative
assignment was determined randomly. The 16 sentences selected during
the first round were re-paired in a second round. This continued until 4
sentences remained, representing sentences that were more strongly conno-
tative or denotative, depending on the prompt. Final sentence scores were
averaged across all evaluations received.
The forced choice scenario requires a sample of only 13 participants to
evaluate 832 sentences. This was a significant improvement over previous
methods, increasing the number of sentences and the number of evaluations
per sentence and therefore increasing the reliability of our findings. For ex-
ample, using this scalable setup on a set of 832 sentences we need only 26
participants to generate two evaluations per sentence in the set, 39 partici-
pants to yield three evaluations per sentence, etc. We ran the system with
a randomly selected sample of both sentences and participants with the in-
tent to eventually make direct comparison among more controlled samples
of sentences and participants. This has direct implication for the evalua-
tion phase of our pilot. Because sentences were selected at random, without
guarantee of a certain number of each type of sentence, our goal was to
achieve results on a par with chance. Anything else would reveal systematic
bias in the experiment design or implementation. This also provides us with
a baseline for future investigations where the stimulus text would be more
wilfully controlled.

4.1 Evaluation of text by human subjects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889727272727">
In the first iteration of the pilot setup, each of 832 sentences were viewed
by six different participants, three assigned to a positive group and three to
a negative group, as described above. The denotative condition ranged in
ratings from 0 to -3 while the connotative condition ranged in rating from 0
to 3. These were then averaged to achieve an overall score for each sentence.
Because they were randomly selected, each sentence had predictable chance
of ultimately being identified as connotative or denotative. In other words,
each sentence had an equal chance of being identified as connotative.
Having established a baseline based on chance, we can next control for
various features and evaluate the relative impact as systematic differences
from the baseline. We will be able to say with a relatively high degree of

certainty that ”x,” ”y” or ”z” feature, sentence structure, behavior, etc.
was responsible for skewing the odds in a reliable manner because we will
be able to control for these variables across various experimental scenarios.
This, combined with improved validity resulting from an increased number
of human judgments and an increased number of sentences viewed, marks
the strength of this methodology.
Additionally, we will be able to compare sentences within each scenario
even when an overall chance outcome occurs. For example, in the initial run
of our sentences, we achieved an overall chance outcome. However, ”anoma-
lies” emerged, sentences that were strongly skewed towards being assigned a
neutral evaluation score or towards an extreme score (either distinctly con-
notative or distinctly denotative). This allowed us to gather a reliable and
valid subset of data that can be utilized in ML experiments. See below for
a very short list of sample sentences grouped according to the overall scores
they received determine by the six human reviewers:

• In fact, do what you bloody well like.
• But it’s pretty interesting , in a depressing sort of way .
• It’s no more a language than American English or Quebecois French

4.2 Experimental Machine Learning system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917833333333">
Our preliminary analysis suggests that humans are consistent in recogniz-
ing the extremes of connotative and denotative sentences and an automatic
recognition system could be built to identify when a text is likely to convey
connotative meaning. Machine Learning (ML) techniques could be used to
enable a system to first classify a text according to whether it conveys a
connotative or denotative level of meaning, and eventually, identify specific
connotations. ML techniques usually assume a feature space within which
the system learns the relative importance of features to use in classification.
Since humans process language at various levels (morphological, lexical, syn-
tactic, semantic, discourse and pragmatic), some multi-level combination of
features is helping them reach consistent conclusions. Hence, the initial ma-
chine learning classification decision will be made based on a class of critical

features, as cognitive and social-cognitive theory suggests happens in human
interpretation of text.
TextTagger, an Information Extraction System developed at Syracuse
University’s Center for Natural Language Processing, currently can identify
sentence boundaries, part-of-speech tag words, stem and lemmatize words,
identify various types of phrases, categorize named entities and common
nouns, recognize relations, and resolve co-references in text. We are in the
process of designing a ML framework that utilizes these tags and can learn
from a few examples provided by the human subject experiments described
above, then train on other sets of similar data marked by analysts as pos-
sessing the features illustrated by the sentences consistently identified as
conveying connotative meaning.
For preliminary ML-based analysis, the data collection included 266 sen-
tences (from the original 832 used in human subject experiments), 145
tagged as strongly connotative and 121 tagged as strongly denotative by
subjects. Fifty sentences from each set became a test collection and the
remaining 95 connotative and 71 denotative sentences were used for train-
ing. Our baseline results (without TextTagger annotations) were: Precision:
44.77 ; Recall: 60; F: 51.28. After tagging, when we only use proper names
and common nouns the results improved: Precision: 51.61 Recall: 92; F:
67.13. Although these results are not as high as some categorization results
reported in the literature for simpler categorization tasks such as document
labeling or spam identification, we believe that using higher level linguistic
features extracted by our NLP technology will significantly improve them.
More sophisticated analysis will be conducted during future applications of
this methodology.

5 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999623">
By allowing the ML system to do time- and labor-intensive analysis, and
exploiting a natural human ability to ”know it when they see it” (in this case
”it” referring to connotative meaning), we feel that this pilot methodology
has great potential to deliver robust results. In addition to the significant
contribution this research will make in the area of natural language process-
ing, it will also provide a model for future work that seeks to create similar
bridges between psychological investigation and system building. Prelimi-
nary results suggest that our approach is viable and that a system composed
of multiple layers of analysis-with each level geared towards reducing the
variability of the next-holds promise.

Future work will concentrate efforts in two areas. First, the notion of
speech communities will be addressed. The pilot study looked at a very gen-
eralized speech community, expecting to achieve equally generalized results.
While this has merit, there is much to be learned by implementing this ap-
proach using a more targeted community. Second, the protocol used in this
pilot study was run using a relatively modest number of human evaluators
and a relatively small set of data. With the experience gained during the
pilot, the reliability of the data used to train the ML system can be easily
improved by increasing the size of both human subject samples and data
sets. With a more robust set of initial data, ML experiments can progress
beyond the basic proof-of-concept results reported here and produce action-
able feature sets tuned to specific speech communities.
