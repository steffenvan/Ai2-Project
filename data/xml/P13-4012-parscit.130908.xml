Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999623357142857">
In this paper, we propose PAL, a prototype
chatterbot for answering non-obstructive
psychological domain-specific questions. This
system focuses on providing primary
suggestions or helping people relieve pressure
by extracting knowledge from online forums,
based on which the chatterbot system is
constructed. The strategies used by PAL,
including semantic-extension-based question
matching, solution management with personal
information consideration, and XML-based
knowledge pattern construction, are described
and discussed. We also conduct a primary test
for the feasibility of our system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952696969697">
A wide variety of chatterbots and
question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) systems have been
proposed over the past decades, each with
strengths that make them appropriate for
particular applications. With numerous advances
in information construction, people increasingly
aim to communicate with computers using natural
language. For example, chatterbots in some
e-commerce Web sites can interact with
customers and provide help similar to a real-life
secretary (DeeAnna Merz Nagel, 2011; Yvette
Col6n, 2011).
In this paper, we propose PAL (Psychologist of
Artificial Language), a chatterbot system for
answering non-obstructive psychological
questions. Non-obstructive questions refer to
problems on family, human relationships,
marriage, life pressure, learning, work and so on.
In these cases, we expect the chatterbot to play an
active role by providing tutoring, solution,
support, advice, or even sympathy depending on
the help needed by its users.
The difference of PAL from existing
chatterbots lies not only in the specific research
focus of this paper but also in the strategies we
designed, such as P-XML templates for storing a
knowledge base, comprehensive question
matching method by considering both index and
semantic similarities, and solution management
by considering personal information. In the
following sections, we will briefly discuss related
work and then introduce our system and its main
features.

<bodyText confidence="0.999928538461539">
A number of research work on chatterbots
(Rafael E. Banchs, Haizhou Li, 2012; Ai Ti Aw
and Lian Hau Lee, 2012), Q&amp;A systems (Shilin
Ding, Gao Cong, Chin-Yew Lin, 2008; Leila
Kosseim, 2008; Tiphaine Dalmas, 2007), and
related natural language understanding
technologies have recently been conducted
(Walid S. Saba, 2007; Jing dong, 2009). Several
studies on the application of natural language
processing technologies for non-obstructive
psychological Q&amp;A systems have also been
published (Hai-hu Shi, 2005).
Several online psychology counselling Web
sites with service provided by human experts have
also been established recently (DeeAnna Merz
Nagel, 2011; Yvette Col6n, 2011). For these Web
sites, when the visitors ask similar questions, the
expert may provide the same or very similar
answers repeatedly. Based on this observation and
consideration, we collected a large number of
counselling Q&amp;A pairs to extract common
knowledge for the construction of a chatterbot
system. Advances in automatic language analysis
and processing are used as the bases for the
emergence of a complex, task-oriented chatterbot
system.

A running screenshot of PAL is shown in Figure
1, and its basic system structure is demonstrated
in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the basic
principles of PAL are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991644125">
1) All interactions between system and users are
scheduled by control logic;
2) When the user inputs a question, the system
will search through its knowledge base for
the matching entry, and then
3) The system will respond with an appropriate
answer by analysing both the matched entry
and the dialogue history.

As shown in Figure 3, the initial state is set to
welcome mode, and the system can select a
sentence from the “sign on” list, which will then
provide a response. When users enter a question,
the system will conduct the necessary analysis.
The system’s knowledge base is indexed by
Clucene1 beforehand. Thus, the knowledge index
will be used to search the matched records quickly.
If the system can find the matched patterns
directly and the answer is suitable for the current
user, one answer will be randomly selected to
generate the response. Historical information and
personal information will be analysed when
necessary. We mainly adopted the method of
ELIZA2 , which is an open-source program, to
consider the historical information. A “not found”
response list is also set to deal with situations
when no suitable answers can be identified. Both
system utterance and user input will be pushed
into the stack as historical information. Given that
user questions are at times very simple, the
combination with historical input may also be
required to determine its meaning. This step can
also avoid the duplication of utterances.

An effective method of capturing the user’s
meaning accurately is to create an extension for
questions in the knowledge base. In this paper, the
extension is primarily a synonym expansion of the
keywords of questions, with CILIN (Wanxiang
Che, 2010) as extension knowledge source.
The questions are indexed by Clucene to
improve the retrieval efficiency of the search for a
matched entry in the knowledge base. During the
knowledge base searching step, both the index of
the original form and the extension form of the
problem are used to find the most possible
matched record for the user’s question, as shown
in algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 is used to examine the
similarity between user input and the record
returned by Clucene, including traditional and
extension similarities.

<bodyText confidence="0.999957714285714">
One question usually has many corresponding
answers in the knowledge base, and these
answers differ in explanation quality. Thus, the
basic strategy employed by solution management
is to select a reliable answer from the matched
record as response, as shown in algorithm 2.
Personalised information includes name entity,
gender, marital status and age information. PAL
maintains some heuristics rules to help recognize
such information. Based on these rules, if one
answer contains personal information, it will be
selected as the candidate answer only when the
personal information is consistent with that of the
current user. Very concise answers that do not

7 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559260869565">
For the current implementation of PAL, the size of
the knowledge base is approximately 1.2G and
contains six different topics: “Husband and
wife”, “Family relations”, “Love affairs”,
“Adolescence”, “Feeling and Mood”, and
“Mental tutors”. Dialogue data collection used in
PAL is mainly crawled from
http://zhidao.baidu.com, which is one of the
largest Chinese online communities. The
criterion for choosing these six categories is also
because they are the main topics in BAIDU
communities about psychological problems.
Some information on the knowledge base is
given in Table 1, in which “Percent of questions
matched” denotes the number of similar
questions found when 100 open questions are
input (we suppose that if the similarity threshold
is bigger than 0.5, then a similar question will be
deemed as “hit” in the knowledge base).
In 7.1, we examine the feasibility of using
downloaded dialogue collection for constructing
the knowledge base. Some dialogue examples are
given in 7.2.

7.1 System Performance Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942681818182">
Additional questions and their corresponding
answers beyond the knowledge base are also used
as a test set to evaluate system performance.
Concretely, suppose question Q has |A |answers in
the test set. Q is then input into the system.
Suppose the system output is O, we examine if
one best answer exists among |A |answers that are
very similar to O (the similarity is greater than
threshold T3). If yes, we then assume that one
suitable answer has been found. In this way,
precision can be calculated as the number of
questions that have very similar answers in the
system divided by the number of all input
questions.
The performance evaluation results are shown
in Figure 5. The horizon axis denotes the
similarity threshold (T1 for sim1 and T2 for sim2)
between a user’s input and the questions in the
knowledge base. Sim1 is the original similarity,
whereas sim2 is the semantic extension similarity.
Different thresholds were used (0.5 to 0.9). The
similarity threshold T3 denotes the similarity
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995125">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998715">
between the answer in the test set and system
output O. From Figures 5 (A) and (B), different
T3 values were used (0.5 to 0.8).
Some observations can be made from Figure 5.
The average system precision is approximately
0.5, and the range is from 0.2 to 0.9. Basically,
when T3 is bigger, the system’s performance
tends to decrease because a high T3 value denotes
a strict evaluation standard. Performance also
differs between different areas, such that D4, D5
and D6 outperform than D1, D2 and D3.
When only index is used and both sim1 and
sim2 are below the corresponding threshold T1 or
T2, the system can still return record set RS2, but
the returned answer may be inconsistent with
user’s question. Thus, incorporating semantic
search shown in algorithm 1 is necessary.

7.2.Some Interaction Examples

<bodyText confidence="0.94270655">
Table 2 provides an interaction example of PAL in
English. As users input their questions, the system
can output the corresponding responses. The entire
dialogue history can also be displayed. Basically,
when users describe their troubles, PAL can
provide some explanation or even try to console the
user.
Compared to other chatterbots like Eliza, PAL
is domain-specific and may provide help to some
extent. Many different answers can usually be
identified. Thus, the user could input the same
question many times, with the system providing
suggestions from different angles. PAL can also
output voice by using Xiao-kun and Microsoft
Anna as the text-to-speech (TTS) engine. The
speed, volume and echo properties of the voice can
be adjusted.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995744933333333">
In this paper, we introduce a simple chatterbot for
answering non-obstructive psychological
questions. The knowledge behind the chatterbot is
learned from the Q&amp;A pairs derived from an
online forum using several extraction strategies.
The historical and personal information from the
dialogues are also incorporated to output an
appropriate answer.
For future work, we expect to add more features
to PAL, e.g., enabling the system to ask questions
actively and further improving P-XML to form
richer patterns for storing Q&amp;A knowledge.
Another interesting aspect would be to add speech
input as well as TTS and to transform PAL into a
mobile platform for widespread use.

Several studies on the application of natural language processing technologies for non-obstructive psychological Q&amp;A systems have also been published (Hai-hu Shi, 2005). Several online psychology counselling Web sites with service provided by human experts have also been established recently (DeeAnna Merz Nagel, 2011; Yvette Col6n, 2011). For these Web sites, when the visitors ask similar questions, the expert may provide the same or very similar answers repeatedly.

In this paper, the extension is primarily a synonym expansion of the keywords of questions, with CILIN (Wanxiang Che, 2010) as extension knowledge source. The questions are indexed by Clucene to improve the retrieval efficiency of the search for a matched entry in the knowledge base. During the knowledge base searching step, both the index of the original form and the extension form of the problem are used to find the most possible matched record for the user’s question, as shown in algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 is used to examine the similarity between user input and the record returned by Clucene, including traditional and extension similarities. Algorithm 1.
