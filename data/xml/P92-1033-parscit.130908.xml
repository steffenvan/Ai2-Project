This paper discusses how a two-level knowledge rep-
resentation model for machine translation integrates as-
pectual information with lexical-semantic information by
means of parameterization. The integration of aspect
with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine
translation because of the lexical selection and aspec-
tual realization processes that operate during the pro-
duction of the target-language sentence: there are of-
ten a large number of lexical and aspectual possibili-
ties to choose from in the production of a sentence from
a lexical semantic representation. Aspectual informa-
tion from the source-language sentence constrains the
choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-
language terms limit the possibilities for generation of
aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication chan-
nel between the two processes. This paper will show
that the selection/realization processes may be parame-
terized so that they operate uniformly across more than
one language and it will describe how the parameter-
based approach is currently being used as the basis for
extraction of aspectual information from corpora.

This paper discusses how the two-level knowledge
representation model for machine translation presented
by Dorr (1991) integrates aspectual information with
lexical-semantic information by means of parameteriza-
tion. The parameter-based approach borrows certain
ideas from previous work such as the lexical-semantic
model of Jackendoff (1983, 1990) and models of as-
pectual representation including Bach (1986), Comrie
(1976), Dowty (1979), Mourelatos (1981), Passonneau
(1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler
(1967). However, unlike previous work, the current
approach examines aspectual considerations within the
context of machine translation. More recently, Bennett

formation and properties of lexical-semantic structure. In

et al. (1990) have examined aspect and verb semantics
within the context of machine translation in the spirit
of Moens and Steedman (1988). This paper borrows
from, and extends, these ideas by demonstrating how
this theoretical framework might be adapted for cross-
linguistic applicability. The framework has been tested
within the context of an interlingual machine transla-
tion system and is currently being used as the basis for
extraction of aspectual information from corpora.
The integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is es-
pecially critical in machine translation because of the
lexical selection and aspectual realization processes that
operate during the production of the target-language
sentence: there are often a large number of lexical and
aspectual possibilities to choose from in the production
of a sentence from a lexical semantic representation. As-
pectual information from the source-language sentence
constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn,
the target-language terms limit the possibilities for gen-
eration of aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communica-
tion channel between the two processes.

We will focus primarily on the third type, aspectual dis-
tinctions, and show how these may be discovered through
the extraction of information in a monolingual corpus.
We adopt the viewpoint that the algorithms for extrac-
tion of syntactic, lexical-semantic, and aspectual infor-
mation must be well-grounded in linguistic theory. Once
the information is extracted, it may then be used as the
basis of parameterized machine translation. Note that
we reject the commonly held assumption that the use of
corpora necessarily suggests that statistical or example-
based techniques be used as the basis for a machine
translation system.
The following section discusses how the two levels of
knowledge, aspectual and lexical-semantic, are used in
an interlingual model of machine translation. We then
describe how this information may be parameterized. Fi-
nally, we discuss how the automatic acquisition of new
lexical entries from corpora is achieved within this frame-
work.

TWO-LEVEL KR MODEL: ASPECTUAL
AND LEXICAL-SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956230769231">
The hypothesis proposed by Tenny (1987, 1989) is
that the mapping between cognitive structure and syn-
tactic structure is governed by aspectual properties.
The implication is that lexical-semantic knowledge ex-
ists at a level that does not include aspectual infor-
mation (though these two types of knowledge may de-
pend on each other in some way). This hypothesis
is consistent with the view adopted here: we assume
that lexical semantic knowledge consists of such notions
as predicate-argument structure, well-formedness condi-
tions on predicate-argument structures, and procedures
for lexical selection of surface-sentence tokens; all other
types of knowledge must be represented at some other
level.
Figure 2 shows the overall design of the UNITRAN
machine translation system (Dorr, 1990a, 1990b). The
system includes a two-level model of knowledge represen-
tation (KR) (see figure 2(a)) in the spirit of Dorr (1991).
The translation example shown here illustrates the fact
that the English sentence John went to the store when
Mary arrived can be translated in two ways in Spanish.
This example will be revisited later.
The lexical-semantic representation that is used as the
interlingua for this system is an extended version of lexi-
cal conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see Jackend-
off (1983, 1990)). This representation is the basis for the
lexical-semantic level that is included in the KR compo-
nent. The second level that is included in this component
is the aspectual structure.
The KR component is parameterized by means of se-
lection charts and coercion functions. The notion of se-
lection charts is described in detail in Dorr and Gaaster-
land (submitted) and will be discussed in the context
of machine translation in the section on the Selection
of Temporal Connectives. The notion of coercion func-
tions was introduced for English verbs by Bennett et al.
(1990). We extend this work by parameterizing the coer-
cion functions and setting the parameters to cover Span-
ish; this will be discussed in the section on Selection and

An example of the type of coercion that will be con-
sidered in this paper is the use of durative adverbials:
John ransacked the house { for an hour.
until Jack arrived.
(ii) John destroyed the house {

for an hour.
(iii)* John obliterated the house {
until Jack arrived.
Durative adverbials (e.g., for an hour and until ...)
are viewed as anti-culminators (following Bennett et al.
(1990)) in that they change the main verb from an ac-
tion that has a definite moment of completion to an ac-
tion that has been stopped but not necessarily finished.
For example, the verb ransack is allowed to be modified
by a durative adverbial since it is inherently durative;
thus, no coercion is necessary in order to use this verb
in the durative sense. In contrast, the verb destroy is
inherently non-durative, but it is coerced into a durative
action by means of adverbial modification; this accounts
for the acceptability of sentence (4)(ii).1 The verb oblit-
erate must necessarily be non-durative (i.e., it is inher-
ently non-durative and non-coercible), thus accounting
for the ill-formedness of sentence (4)(iii).
In addition to the KR component, there is also a syn-
tactic representation (SR) component (see figure 2(b))
that is used for manipulating the syntactic structure of
a sentence. We will omit the discussion of the SR compo-
nent of UNITRAN (see, for example, Dorr (1987)) and
will concern ourselves only with the KR component for
the purposes of this paper.
The remainder of this section defines the dividing line
between lexical knowledge (i.e., properties of predicates
&apos;Some native speakers consider sentence (4)(ii) to be odd,
at best. This is additional evidence for the existence of in-
herent features and suggests that, in some cases (i.e., for
some native speakers), the inherent features are considered
to be absolute overrides, even in the presence of modifiers
that might potentially change the aspectual features.

and their arguments) and non-lexical knowledge (i.e.,
aspect), and discusses how these two types of knowledge
are combined in the KR component.
Lexical- Semantic Structure. Lexical-semantic struct-
ure exists at a level of knowledge representation that
is distinct from that of aspect in that it encodes infor-
mation about predicates and their arguments, plus the
potential realization possibilities in a given language.
In terms of the representation proposed by Jackendoff
(1983, 1990), the lexical-semantic structures for the two
events of figure 2 would be the following:

<bodyText confidence="0.9996926">
Although temporal connectives are not included in Jack-
endoff&apos;s theory, it is assumed that these two structures
would be related by means of a lexical-semantic token
corresponding to the temporal relation between the two
events.
The lexical-semantic representation provided by Jack-
endoff distinguishes between events and states; however,
this distinction alone is not sufficient for choosing among
similar predicates that occur in different aspectual cat-
egories. In particular, events can be further subdivided
into more specific types so that non-culminative events
(i.e., events that do not have a definite moment of com-
pletion) such as ransack can be distinguished from cul-
minative events (i.e., events that have a definite moment
of completion) such as obliterate. This is a crucial dis-
tinction given that these two similar words cannot be
used interchangeably in all contexts. Such distinctions
are handled by augmenting the lexical-semantic frame-
work so that it includes aspectual information, which we
will describe in the next section.
Aspectual Structure. Aspect is taken to have two
components, one comprised of inherent features (i.e.,
those features that distinguish between states and
events) and another comprised of non-inherent features
(i.e., those features that define the perspective, e.g., sim-
ple, progressive, and perfective). This paper will focus
primarily on inherent features.3
Previous representational frameworks have omitted
aspectual distinctions among verbs, and have typically
merged events under the single heading of dynamic (see,
e.g., Yip (1985)). However, a number of aspectually
oriented lexical-semantic representations have been pro-
posed that more readily accommodate the types of as-
pectual distinctions discussed here. The current work
borrows extends these ideas for the development of an
interlingual representation. For example, Dowty (1979)
and Vendler (1967) have proposed a four-way aspectual
classification system for verbs: states, activities, achieve-
ments, and accomplishments, each of which has a dif-
ferent degree of telicity (i.e., culminated vs. nonculmi-

nated), and/or atomicity (i.e., point vs. extended).4 A
similar scheme has been suggested by Bach (1986) and
Pustejovsky (1989) (following Mourelatos (1981) and
Comrie (1976)) in which actions are classified into states,
processes, and events.
The lexical-semantic structure adopted for UNITRAN
is an augmented form of Jackendoff&apos;s representation
in which events are distinguished from states (as be-
fore), but events are further subdivided into activities,
achievements, and accomplishments. The subdivision is
achieved by means of three features proposed by Ben-
nett et a/. (1990) following the framework of Moens and
Steedman (1988): ±dynamic (i.e., events vs. states,
as in the Jackendoff framework), ±telic (i.e., culmina-
tive events (transitions) vs. nonculminative events (ac-
tivities)), and ±atomic (i.e., point events vs. extended
events). We impose this system of features on top of
the current lexical-semantic framework. For example,
the lexical entry for all three verbs, ransack, obliterate,
and destroy, would contain the following lexical-semantic
representation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.244523333333333">
(6) [Event CAUSE ((Thing X], [Event GOLon
([Thing[Position TOLoc ax
John], [property DESTROYED])])])]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921333333333">
The three verbs would then be distinguished by annotat-
ing this representation with the aspectual features [+d,-
t,-al for the verb ransack, H-d,-1-t,-a] for the verb destroy,
and [-1-d,-Et,-f-a] for the verb obliterate, thus providing
the appropriate distinction for cases such as (4).5
In the next section, we will see how the lexical-
semantic representation and the aspectual structure are
combined parametrically to provide the framework for
generating a target-language surface form.

Although issues concerning lexical-semantics and as-
pect have been studied extensively, they have not been
examined sufficiently in the context of machine trans-
lation. Machine translation provides an appropriate
testbed for trying out theories of lexical semantics and
aspect. The problem of lexical selection during genera-
tion of the target language is the most crucial issue in
this regard. The current framework facilitates the se-
lection of temporal connectives and the aspectual real-
ization of verbs. We will discuss each of these, in turn,
4Dowty&apos;s version of this classification collapses achieve-
ments and accomplishments into a single event type called
a transition, which covers both the point and extended ver-
sions of the event type. The rationale for this move is that
all events have some duration, even in the case of so-called
punctual events, depending on the granularity of time in-
volved. (See Passonneau (1988) for an adaptation of this
scheme as implemented in the PUNDIT system.) For the
purposes of this discussion, we will maintain the distinction
between achievements and accomplishments.

Selection of Temporal Connectives: Selection
Charts. In order to ensure that the framework pre-
sented here is cross-linguistically applicable, we must
provide a mechanism for handling temporal connective
selection in languages other than English. For the pur-
poses of this discussion, we will examine distinctions be-
tween English and Spanish only.
Consider the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997211">
(7) (i) John went to the store when Mary arrived.
(ii) John had gone to the store when Mary arrived.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997766785714286">
In Dorr (1991), we discussed the selection of the lexical
connective when on the basis of the temporal relation
between the main or matrix clause and the subordinate
or adjunct clause.6 For the purposes of this paper, we
will ignore the temporal component of word selection
and will focus instead on how the process of word selec-
tion may be parameterized using the aspectual features
described in the last section.
To translate (7)(i) and (ii) into Spanish, we must
choose between the lexical tokens cuando and a/ in or-
der to generate the equivalent temporal connective for
the word when. In the case of (7)(i), there are two pos-
sible translations, one that uses the connective cuando,
and one that uses the connective al:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93928">
(8) (i) Juan fue a la tienda cuando Marfa Ileg6.
(ii) Juan fue a la tienda al Ilegar Marfa.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934842">
Either one of these sentences is an acceptable translation
for (7)(i). However, the same is not true of (7)(11):7
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9926915">
(9) (i) Juan habfa ido a la tienda cuando Marfa Ileg6.
(ii) Juan habfa ido a la tienda al Ilegar Marfa.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999463928571429">
Sentence (9)(i) is an acceptable translation of (7)(ii),
but (9)(ii) does not mean the same thing as (7)(ii). This
second sentence implies that John has already gone to
the store and come back, which is not the preferred read-
ing.
In order to establish an association between these con-
nectives and the aspectual interpretation for the two
events (i.e., the matrix and adjunct clause), we com-
pile a table, called a selection chart, for each language
that specifies the contexts in which each connective may
be used. Figure 3 shows the charts for when, cuando,
and al.8
The selection charts can be viewed as inverted dic-
tionary entries in that they map features to words, not

words to features.9 The charts serve as a means of pa-
rameterization for the program that generates sentences
from the interlingual representation in that they are al-
lowed to vary from language to language while the pro-
cedure for choosing temporal connectives applies cross-
linguistically.10 The key point to note is that the chart
for the Spanish connective al is similar to that for the
English connective when except that the word al requires
the matrix event to have the +telic feature (i.e., the ma-
trix action must reach a culmination). This accounts for
the distinction between cuando and a/ in sentences (9)(i)
and (9)(ii) above.11,12
These tables are used for the selection of temporal
connectives during the generation process (for which the
relevant index into the tables would be the aspectual
features associated with the interlingual representation).
The selection of a temporal connective, then, is simply a
table look-up procedure based on the aspectual features
associated with the events.
Selection and Aspectual Realization of Verbs:
Coercion Functions. Above, we considered the se-
lection of temporal connectives without regard to the
selection and aspectual realization of the lexical items
that were being connected. Again, to ensure that the
framework presented here is cross-linguistically applica-
ble, we must provide a mechanism for handling lexical se-
lection and aspectual realization in languages other than
English.
Consider the English sentence I stabbed Mary. This
may be realized in at least two ways in Spanish:13
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996187">
(10) (i) Juan le dio punaladas a Marfa
(ii) Juan le dio una puiialada a Marfa
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992720035714286">
&apos;Note, however, that the features correspond to the events
connected by the words, not to the words themselves.
10Because we are not discussing the realization of temporal
information (i.e., the time relations between the matrix and
adjunct events), an abbreviated form of the actual chart is
being used. Specifically, the chart shown in figure 3 assumes
that the matrix event occurs before the adjunct event. See
Dorr (1991) and Don and Gaasterland (submitted) for more
details about the relationship between temporal information
and aspectual information and the actual procedures that are
used for the selection of temporal connectives.
lilt has recently been pointed out by Michael Herweg (per-
sonal communication, 1991b) that the telic feature is not
traditionally used to indicate a revoked consequence state
(e.g., the consequence state that results after returning from
the &amp;quot;going to the store&amp;quot; event), but it is generally intended
to indicate an irrevocable, culminative, consequence state.
Thus, it has been suggested that al acts more as a corn-
plementizer than as a &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; adverbial connective such as
cuando; this would explain the realization of the adjunct not
as a tensed adverbial clause, but as an infinitival subordinate
clause. This possibility is currently under investigation.
12Space limitations do not permit the enumeration of the
other selection charts for temporal connectives, but see Dorr
and Gaasterland (submitted) for additional examples. Some
of the connectives that have been compiled into tables are:
after, as soon as, at the moment that, before, between, during,
since, so long as, until, while, etc.

Both of these sentences translate literally to &amp;quot;John gave
stab wound(s) to Mary.&amp;quot; However, the first sentence
is the repetitive version of the action (i.e., there were
multiple stab wounds), whereas the second sentence is
the non-repetitive version of the action (i.e., there was
only one stab wound). This distinction is character-
ized by means of the atomicity feature. In (10)(i), the
event is associated with the features [-I-d,+t,-a], whereas,
in (10)(ii) the event is associated with the features
[-I-d,+t,-Fa].
According to Bennett et a/. (1990), predicates are al-
lowed to undergo an atomicity &amp;quot;coercion&amp;quot; in which an
inherently non-atomic predicate (such as dio) may be-
come atomic under certain conditions. These conditions
are language-specific in nature, i.e., they depend on the
lexical-semantic structure of the predicate in question.
Given the current featural scheme that is imposed on
top of the lexical-semantic framework, it is easy to spec-
ify coercion functions for each language.
We have devised a set of coercion functions for Spanish
analogous to those proposed for English by Bennett et al.
The feature coercion parameters for Spanish differ from
those for English. For example, the atomicity function
does not have the same applicability in Spanish as it
does for English. We saw this earlier in sentence (10), in
which a singular NP verbal object maps a [-a] predicate
into a [+a] predicate, i.e., a non-atomic event becomes
atomic if it is associated with a singular NP object. The
parameterized mappings that we have constructed for
Spanish are shown in figure 4(a). For the purposes of
comparison, the analogous English functions proposed
by Bennett et a/. (1990) are shown in figure 4(b).&amp;quot;
Using the functions, we are able to apply the notion
of feature-based coercion cross-linguistically, while still
accounting for parametric distinctions. Thus, feature
coercion provides a useful foundation for a model of in-
terlingual machine translation.
A key point about the aspectual features and coercion
functions is that they allow for a two-way communica-
tion channel between the two processes of lexical selec-
tion and aspectual realization.&amp;quot; To clarify this point, we
return to our example that compares the three English
verbs, ransack, destroy, and obliterate (see example (4)
above). Recall that the primary distinguishing feature
among these three verbs was the notion of telicity (i.e.,
culminated vs. nonculminated). The lexical-semantic
representation for all three verbs is identical, but the

ercible&amp;quot; verb, it is stored in the lexicon as ±telic with a
flag that forces -telic to be the inherent (i.e., default) set-
ting. Thus, if we are generating a surface sentence from
an interlingual form that matches these three verbs but
we know the value of the telic feature from the context
of the source-language sentence (i.e., we are able to de-
termine whether the activity reached a definite point of
completion), then we will choose ransack, if the setting
is +telic, or obliterate or destroy, if the setting is -telic.
In this latter case, only the word destroy will be selected
if the interlingua includes a component that will be re-
alized as a durative adverbial phrase.
Once the aspectual features have guided the lexical
selection of the verbs, we are able to use these selections
to guide the aspectual realizations that will be used in
the surface form. For example, if we have chosen the
word obliterate we would want to realize the verb in
the simple past or present (e.g., obliterated or obliter-
ate) rather than in the progressive (e.g., was obliterating
or is obliterating). Thus, the aspectual features (and co-
ercion functions) are used to choose lexical items, and
the choice of lexical items is used to realize aspectual
features.
The coercion functions are crucial for this two-way
channel to operate properly. In particular, we must take
care not to blindly forbid non-atomic verbs from being
realized in the progressive since point activities, which
are atomic (e.g., tap), are frequently realized in the pro-
gressive (e.g., he was tapping the table). In such cases
the progressive morpheme is being used as an iterator
of several identical atomic events as defined in the func-
tions shown in figure 4. Thus, we allow &amp;quot;coercible&amp;quot; verbs

selected and realized with the non-inherent feature set-

ACQUISITION OF NOVEL LEXICAL
ENTRIES: DISCOVERING THE LINK
BETWEEN LCS AND ASPECT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977">
In evaluating the parameterization framework pro-
posed here, we will focus on one evaluation metric,
namely the ease with which lexical entries may be au-
tomatically acquired from on-line resources. While test-
ing the framework against this metric, a number of re-
sults have been obtained, including the discovery of a
fundamental relationship between aspectual information
and lexical-semantic information that provides a link be-
tween the primitives of Jackendoff&apos;s LCS representations
and the features of the aspectual scheme described here.
Approach. A program has been developed for the au-
tomatic acquisition of novel lexical entries for machine
translation.&amp;quot; We are in the process of building an En-
glish dictionary, and intend to use the same approach
for building dictionaries in other languages, (e.g., Span-
ish, German, Korean, and Arabic). The program au-
tomatically acquires aspectual representations from cor-
pora (currently the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen17 (LOB) cor-
pus) by examining the context in which all verbs occur
and then dividing them into four groups: state, activity,
accomplishment, and achievement. As we noted earlier,
these four groups correspond to different combinations of
aspectual features (i.e., telic, atomic, and dynamic) that
have been imposed on top of the lexical-semantic frame-
work. Thus, if we are able to isolate these components
of verb meaning, we will have made significant progress
toward our ultimate goal of automatically acquiring full
lexical-semantic representations of verb meaning.
The division of verbs into these four groups is based on
several syntactic tests that are well-defined in the linguis-
tic literature such as those by Dowty (1979) shown in fig-
ure 5.18 Some tests of verb aspect shown here could not
be implemented in the acquisition program because they
require human interpretations. These tests are marked
by asterisks (*). For example, Test 2 requires human
interpretation to determine whether or not a verb has
habitual interpretation in simple present tense.
The algorithm for determining the aspectual category
of verbs is shown in figure 6. Note that step 3 applies
Dowty&apos;s tests to a set of sentences corresponding to a
particular verb until a unique category has been iden-
tified. In order for this step to succeed, we must en-
sure that Dowty&apos;s tests allow the four categories to be
uniquely identified. However, a complication arises for
the state category: out of the six tests that have been
implemented from Dowty&apos;s table, only Test 1 uniquely

sets states apart from the other three aspectual cate-
gories. That is, Test 1 is the only implemented test that
has a value in the first column that is different from the
other three columns. Note, however, that the value in
this column is NO, which poses a problem for the above
algorithm. Herein lies one of the major stumbling blocks
for the extraction of information from corpora: it is only
possible to derive new information in cases where there
is a YES value in a given column. By definition, a cor-
pus only provides positive evidence; it does not provide
negative evidence. We cannot say anything about sen-
tences that do not appear in the corpus. Just because
a given sentence does not occur in a particular sample
of English text does not mean that it can never show
up in English. This means we are relying solely on the
information that does appear in the corpus, i.e., we are
only able to learn something new about a verb when it
corresponds to a YES in one of the rows of figure 5.19
Given that the identification of stative verbs could not
be achieved by Dowty&apos;s tests alone, a number of hypothe-
ses were made in order to identify states by other means.
A preliminary analysis of the sentences in the corpus re-
veals that progressive verbs are generally preceded by
verbs such as be, like, hate, go, stop, start, etc. These

idence can refute an incorrect guess.&amp;quot;

verbs fall under a lexical-semantic category identified by
Jackendoff (1983, 1990) as the circumstantial category.
Based on this observation, the following hypothesis has
been made:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9360055">
Hypothesis 1: The only types of verbs that are allowed to
precede progressive verbs are circumstantial verbs.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.970683733333333">
Circumstantial verbs subsume stative verbs, but they
also include verbs in other categories. In terms of
the lexical-semantic primitives proposed by Jackendoff
(1983, 1990), the circumstantial verbs found in a sub-
set of the corpus are categorized as shown in figure 7.
An intriguing result of this categorization is that the
circumstantial verbs provide a systematic partitioning
of Dowty&apos;s aspectual categories (i.e., states, activities,
and achievements) into primitives of Jackendoff&apos;s system
(i.e., BE, STAY, and GO). Thus, the analysis of the cor-
pora has provided a crucial link between the primitives of
Jackendoff&apos;s LCS representation and the features of the
aspectual scheme described earlier. If this is the case,
then the framework has proven to be well-suited to the
task of automatic construction of conceptual structures
from corpora.
Assuming this partitioning is correct and complete,
Hypothesis 1 can be refined as follows:
Hypothesis V: The only types of verbs that are allowed to
precede progressive verbs are states, achievements, and activi-
ties.
If this hypothesis is valid, the program is in a better posi-
tion to identify stative verbs because it corresponds to a
test that requires positive evidence rather than negative
evidence. The hypothesis can be described by adding
the following line to figure 5:
Because there is a YES in the column headed by STA,
verbs satisfying this test are potentially stative. Thus,
once a verb X is found that satisfies this test, we apply

been obtained from running the program on 219 sen-
tences of the LOB corpus (see figure 9).21 Note that the
program was not able to pare down the aspectual cate-
gory to one in every case. We expect to have a significant
improvement in the classification results once the sample
size is increased.
Presumably more tests would be needed for additional
improvements in results. For example, we have not pro-
posed any tests that would guarantee the unique identi-
fication of accomplishments. Such tests are the subject
of future research.

20Note that this algorithm does not guarantee that states
will be correctly identified in all cases given that step 3 is a
heuristic assumption. However, if Test 12 has applied, and
state is still an active possibility, it is considerably safer to
assume the verb is a state than it would be otherwise because
we have eliminated accomplishments.

In addition, research is currently underway to deter-
mine the restrictions (analogous to those shown in fig-
ure 5) that exist for other languages (e.g., Spanish, Ger-
man, Korean, and Arabic). Because the program is para-
metrically designed, it is expected to operate uniformly
on corpora in other languages as well.
Another future area of research is the automatic ac-
quisition of parameter settings for the construction of
selection charts and aspectual coercion mappings on a
per-language basis.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953608695652">
This paper has examined a two-level knowledge repre-
sentation model for machine translation that integrates
aspectual information based on theories by Bach (1986),
Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), Mourelatos (1981), Pas-
sonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and
Vendler (1967), and more recently by Bennett 0 al.
(1990) and Moens and Steedman (1988), with lexical-
semantic information based on Jackendoff (1983, 1990).
We have examined the question of cross-linguistic ap-
plicability showing that the integration of aspect with
lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine transla-
tion when there are a large number of temporal connec-
tives and verbal selection/realization possibilities that
may be generated from a lexical semantic representa-
tion. Furthermore, we have illustrated that the se-
lection/realization processes may be parameterized, by
means of selection charts and coercion functions, so that
the processes may operate uniformly across more than
one language. Finally, we have discussed the application
of the theoretical foundations to the automatic acquisi-
tion of aspectual representations from corpora in order to
augment the lexical-semantic representations that have
already been created for a large number of verbs.

<abstract confidence="0.998662272727273">This paper discusses how a two-level knowledge representation model for machine translation integrates aspectual information with lexical-semantic information by means of parameterization. The integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection and aspectual realization processes that operate during the production of the target-language sentence: there are often a large number of lexical and aspectual possibilities to choose from in the production of a sentence from a lexical semantic representation. Aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the targetlanguage terms limit the possibilities for generation of aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes. This paper will show that the selection/realization processes may be parameterized so that they operate uniformly across more than one language and it will describe how the parameterbased approach is currently being used as the basis for extraction of aspectual information from corpora.</abstract>

This representation is the basis for the lexical-semantic level that is included in the KR component. The second level that is included in this component is the aspectual structure. The KR component is parameterized by means of selection charts and coercion functions. The notion of selection charts is described in detail in Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) and will be discussed in the context of machine translation in the section on the Selection of Temporal Connectives. The notion of coercion functions was introduced for English verbs by Bennett et al. (1990). We extend this work by parameterizing the coercion functions and setting the parameters to cover Spanish; this will be discussed in the section on Selection and Aspectual Realization of Verbs. An example of the type of coercion that will be considered in this paper is the use of durative adverbials: John ransacked the house { for an hour. until Jack arrived. (ii) John destroyed the house { until Jack arrived. for an hour. (iii)* John obliterated the house { until Jack arrived.

Selection of Temporal Connectives: Selection Charts. In order to ensure that the framework presented here is cross-linguistically applicable, we must provide a mechanism for handling temporal connective selection in languages other than English. For the purposes of this discussion, we will examine distinctions between English and Spanish only. Consider the following example: (7) (i) John went to the store when Mary arrived. (ii) John had gone to the store when Mary arrived. In Dorr (1991), we discussed the selection of the lexical connective when on the basis of the temporal relation between the main or matrix clause and the subordinate or adjunct clause.6 For the purposes of this paper, we will ignore the temporal component of word selection and will focus instead on how the process of word selection may be parameterized using the aspectual features described in the last section. To translate (7)(i) and (ii) into Spanish, we must choose between the lexical tokens cuando and a/ in order to generate the equivalent temporal connective for the word when.

Specifically, the chart shown in figure 3 assumes that the matrix event occurs before the adjunct event.

This paper will focus primarily on inherent features.3 Previous representational frameworks have omitted aspectual distinctions among verbs, and have typically merged events under the single heading of dynamic (see, e.g., Yip (1985)). However, a number of aspectually oriented lexical-semantic representations have been proposed that more readily accommodate the types of aspectual distinctions discussed here. The current work borrows extends these ideas for the development of an interlingual representation. For example, Dowty (1979) and Vendler (1967) have proposed a four-way aspectual classification system for verbs: states, activities, achievements, and accomplishments, each of which has a different degree of telicity (i.e., culminated vs. nonculmi2The empty location denoted by e corresponds to an unrealized argument of the predicate arrive. 3See Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) for a discussion about non-inherent aspectual features. nated), and/or atomicity (i.e., point vs. extended).4 A similar scheme has been suggested by Bach (1986) and Pustejovsky (1989) (following Mourelatos (1981) and Comrie (1976)) in which act</context>

As we noted earlier, these four groups correspond to different combinations of aspectual features (i.e., telic, atomic, and dynamic) that have been imposed on top of the lexical-semantic framework. Thus, if we are able to isolate these components of verb meaning, we will have made significant progress toward our ultimate goal of automatically acquiring full lexical-semantic representations of verb meaning. The division of verbs into these four groups is based on several syntactic tests that are well-defined in the linguistic literature such as those by Dowty (1979) shown in figure 5.18 Some tests of verb aspect shown here could not be implemented in the acquisition program because they require human interpretations. These tests are marked by asterisks (*). For example, Test 2 requires human interpretation to determine whether or not a verb has habitual interpretation in simple present tense. The algorithm for determining the aspectual category of verbs is shown in figure 6. Note that step 3 applies Dowty&apos;s tests to a set of sentences corresponding to a particular verb until a unique category has been identified. In order for this step to succeed, we mus</context>

Figure 2 shows the overall design of the UNITRAN machine translation system (Dorr, 1990a, 1990b). The system includes a two-level model of knowledge representation (KR) (see figure 2(a)) in the spirit of Dorr (1991). The translation example shown here illustrates the fact that the English sentence John went to the store when Mary arrived can be translated in two ways in Spanish. This example will be revisited later. The lexical-semantic representation that is used as the interlingua for this system is an extended version of lexical conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see Jackendoff (1983, 1990)). This representation is the basis for the lexical-semantic level that is included in the KR component. The second level that is included in this component is the aspectual structure. The KR component is parameterized by means of selection charts and coercion functions. The notion of selection charts is described in detail in Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) and will be discussed in the context of machine translation in the section on the Selection of Temporal Connectives. The notion of coercion functions was introduced for English verbs by Bennett et al. (1990). We extend this work by</context>

Lexical-semantic structure exists at a level of knowledge representation that is distinct from that of aspect in that it encodes information about predicates and their arguments, plus the potential realization possibilities in a given language.
