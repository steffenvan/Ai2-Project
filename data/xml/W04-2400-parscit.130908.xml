The 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2004) is the
eighth in a series of meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural
language learning. This year’s CoNLL will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, USA on May 6 and
7, in conjunction with the HLT-NAACL 2004 Conference. This is the first time that CoNLL will be
held in the USA.
The annual CoNLL meeting is intended to address all aspects of computational natural language
learning. We have an exciting program this year, thanks to the many good submissions that we
received. In all, 23 papers were submitted to the main session, of which 11 were selected by the
program committee to be presented at the conference. They represent cutting-edge research on
computational natural language learning.
In keeping with the unique tradition of CoNLL, we also have a shared task session this year,
on semantic role labeling, which is a topic of growing interest in the field. The shared task was
coordinated by Xavier Carreras and Lluis M`arquez. Common training and test data were made
available to all participants, who had to build their learning system and test it on this task. We
received enthusiastic responses from many research groups, and the shared task papers contain
descriptions of the ten participating systems and their results.
This year’s CoNLL also features two invited presentations, one by Christopher Manning on
what the future holds for computational language learning, and one by Martha Palmer on semantic
role labeling, the topic of this year’s shared task.
Our program committee and additional reviewers have spent much time carefully reviewing the
submitted papers, for which we are most grateful. We would also like to thank the HLT-NAACL
2004 conference organizers for helping us with the local organization. And a special thanks for the
enthusiastic and capable work of Xavier Carreras and Lluis M`arquez in organizing and running the
semantic role labeling shared task.
We wish you an enjoyable time attending CoNLL-2004!
