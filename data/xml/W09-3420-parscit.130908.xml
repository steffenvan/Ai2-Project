This paper describes semi-automatic construc-
tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method
for Asian wordNet. Based on the Princeton
WordNet, we develop a method in generating
a WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual dic-
tionary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-
lingual dictionary through the English equiva-
lent and its part-of-speech (POS), automati-
cally. Manual translation is also employed af-
ter the alignment. We also develop a web-
based collaborative workbench, called KUI
(Knowledge Unifying Initiator), for revising
the result of synset assignment and provide a
framework to create Asian WordNet via the
linkage through PWN synset.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943880952381">
The Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbuam,
1998) is one of the most semantically rich Eng-
lish lexical banks widely used as a resource in
many research and development. WordNet is a
great inspiration in the extensive development of
this kind of lexical database in other languages.
It is not only an important resource in imple-
menting NLP applications in each language, but
also in inter-linking WordNets of different lan-
guages to develop multi-lingual applications to
overcome the language barrier. There are some
efforts in developing WordNets of some lan-
guages (Atserias and et al., 1997; Vossen, 1997;
Farrers and et al., 1998; Balkova and et al., 2004;
Isahara and et al., 2008). But the number of lan-
guages that have been successfully developed
their WordNets is still limited to some active
research in this area. This paper, however, is the
one of that attempt.
This paper describes semi-automatic construc-
tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method for
Asian WordNet. Based on the Princeton Word-
Net, we develop a method in generating a
WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual diction-
ary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-lingual
dictionary through the English equivalent and its
part-of-speech (POS), automatically. Manual
translation is also employed after the alignment.
We also develop a web-based collaborative
workbench, called KUI (Knowledge Unifying
Initiator), for revising the result of synset as-
signment and provide a framework to create
Asian WordNet via the linkage through PWN
synset.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes how we construct the Thai
WordNet, including approaches, methods, and
some significant language dependent issues ex-
perienced along the construction. Section 3 pro-
vides the information on Asian WordNet con-
struction and progress. And Section 4 concludes
our work.

2.1 Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956409090909">
To build language WordNet from scratch, two
approaches were brought up into the discussion:
the merge approach and the expand approach.
The merge approach is to build the taxonomies
of the language; synsets and relations, and then
map to the PWN by using the English equivalent
words from existing bilingual dictionaries.
The expand approach is to map or translate lo-
cal words directly to the PWN&apos;s synsets by using
the existing bilingual dictionaries.
Employing the merge approach, for Thai as an
example, we will completely get synsets and re-
lations for the Thai language. But it is time and
budget consuming task and require a lot of
skilled lexicographers as well, while less time
and budget is used when employing the expand
approach to get a translated version of WordNet.
But some particular Thai concepts which do not
occur in PWN will not exist in this lexicon.
Comparing between these two approaches, the
Thai WordNet construction intended to follow
the expand approach by this following reasons;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996495666666667">
• Many languages have developed their
own WordNet using the PWN as a
model, so we can link Thai lexical data-
base to those languages.
• The interface for collaboration for other
languages can be easily developed.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994382">
2.2 Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999536">
As presented above, we follow the expand ap-
proach to construct the Thai WordNet by trans-
lating the synsets in the PWN to the Thai lan-
guage. Both automatic and manual methods are
applied in the process.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.918084">
2.2.1 Automatic Synset Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855777777778">
Following the objective to translate the PWN to
Thai, we attempted to use the existing lexical
resources to facilitate the construction. We pro-
posed an automatic method to assign an appro-
priate synset to a lexical entry by considering its
English equivalent and lexical synonyms which
are most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual dic-
tionary. (Charoenporn 2008; Sornlertlamvanich,
2008).

<bodyText confidence="0.9981111">
For the result, there is only 12% of the total
number of the synsets that were able to be as-
signed to Thai lexical entries. And about 24% of
Thai lexical entries were found with the English
equivalents that meet one of our criteria. Table 1
shows the successful rate in assigning synsets to
the lexical entry in the Thai-English Dictionary.
Considering the list of unmapped lexical entry,
the errors can be classified into three groups, as
the following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.792507">
1. The English equivalent is assigned in a
compound, especially in case that there

<bodyText confidence="0.9513832">
is no an appropriate translation to repre-
sent exactly the same sense. For exam-
ple,
L: รานคาปลีก raan3-khaa3-pleek1
E: retail shop
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964167">
2. Some particular words culturally used I
one language may not be simply trans-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.963775058823529">
lated into one single word sense in Eng-
lish. In this case, we found it explained
in a phrase. For example,
L: กรรเจียก kan0-jeak1
E: bouquet worn over the ear
3. Inflected forms i.e. plural, past partici-
ple, are used to express an appropriate
sense of a lexical entry. This can be
found in non-inflection languages such
as Thai and most of Asian languages,
For example,
L: ราวระทม raaw3-ra0-thom0
E: greived
By using this method, a little part of PWN has
been translated into Thai. About 88% of the total
number of the synsets still cannot be assigned.
Manual step is therefore applied.

2.2.2 Manual Construction
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965">
Human translation is our next step for synset
translation. Two important issues were taken into
discussion, when starting the translation process.
Those are;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977784285714286">
• How to assign or translate new concepts
that still do not occur in the Thai lexicon.
Compound word or phrase is acceptable
or not.
• Which equivalent do we need to consider,
synset-to-synset equivalent or word-to-
word equivalent?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.935616176470588">
For the first issue, we actually intend to trans-
late the PWN synsets into single Thai word only.
But problems occurred when we faced with con-
cept that has not its equivalent word. For exam-
ple,
filly#1 -- (a young female horse under the age
of four)
colt2#1 – (a young male horse under the age
of four)
hog2#2, hogget#1, hogg#2 – (a sheep up to
the age of one year: one yet to be sheared)
There is not any word that conveys the mean-
ing of the above concepts. That is because of the
difference of the culture. In this case, phrase or
compound word will be introduced to use as the
equivalent word of the concept. This phenome-
non always occurs with cultural dependent con-
cept, technical terms and new concepts.
As for the second issue, considering between
(1) synset-to-synset equivalent assignment or (2)
word-to-word equivalent assignment has to be
discussed. Let consider the following concept of
“dog” in the PWN.
dog#1, domestic dog#1, Canis familiaris#1 --
(a member of the genus Canis (probably de-
scended from the common wolf) that has been
domesticated by man since prehistoric times;
occurs in many breeds; &amp;quot;the dog barked all
night&amp;quot;)
The above synset consists of three words; dog,
domestic dog, and Canis familiaris. The set of
Thai synonyms that is equivalent to this English
synset is the following.
Thai synset of ‘dog’
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.610398333333333">
{T1 หมา maa4 ‘dog’ (normal word),
T2 สุนัข su1-nak3 ‘dog’ (polite word),
T3 สุนัขบาน su1-nak3-baan0 ‘domestic dog’,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.956233">
T4 คานิส แฟมิเลียริส kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-lia0-ris3
‘Canis familiaris’}
These words have the same concepts but are
different in usage. How do we choose the right
Thai word for the right equivalent English word?
It is a crucial problem. In the paragraph below,
three English words which represent the concept
“dog” are used in the different context and can-
not be interchanged. Similarly, T1, T2 and T3
cannot be used substitutionally. Because it con-
veys different meaning. Therefore, word-to-word
is our solution.
“...Dog usually means the domestic dog,
Canis lupus familiaris (or &amp;quot;Canis familiaris&amp;quot; in
binomial nomenclature)....”
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.850774666666667">
Dog T1 หมา maa4 ‘dog’,
T2 สุนัข su1-nak3 ‘dog’
Domestic dog T3 สุนัขบาน

‘domestic dog’
Canis familiaris T4 คานิส แฟมิเลียริส
kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-
lia0-ris3
‘Canis familiaris’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9917906">
Consequently, word-to-word equivalent is
very useful for choosing the right synonyms with
the right context.
In conclusion, the main principle for the Eng-
lish to Thai translation includes
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986072555555556">
(1) “Single word” is lexicalized the existence
of concepts in Thai.
(2) “Compound” or “Phrase” is represented
some concepts that are not lexicalized in
Thai.
(3) Synset-to-synset equivalent is used for
finding Thai synset that is compatible
with PWN synset.
(4) Word-to-word equivalent is used for find-

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.827483">
2.3.1 Out of concepts in PWN
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993166666667">
There are some Thai words/concepts that do not
exist in the PWN, especially cultural-related
words. This is the major problem we have to
solve during the translation.
One of our future plans is to add synsets that
do not exist into the PWN.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.642999">
2.3.2 Concept differentiation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926714285714">
Some concepts in the PWN are not equal to Thai
concepts. For example, a synset {appear, come
out} represents one concept “be issued or pub-
lished” in English, but meanwhile, it represents
two concepts in Thai, the concept of printed mat-
ter, and the concept of film or movie, respec-
tively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.776837">
2.3.3 Concept Structure differentiation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997527875">
In some cases, the level of the concept relation
between English and Thai is not equal. For ex-
ample, {hair} in the PWN represents a concept
of “a covering for the body (or parts of it) con-
sisting of a dense growth of threadlike structures
(as on the human head); helps to prevent heat
loss; ...” but in Thai, it is divided into two con-
cepts;
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.486184333333333">
T1 iu khon4 ‘hair’
= “hair” that cover the body
T2 rwu phom4 ‘hair’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996724333333333">
= “hair” that cover on the human head
This shows the nonequivalent of concept.
Moreover, it also differs in the relation of con-
cept. In PWN “hair” is a more general concept
and “body hair” is more specific concepts. But in
Thai T1 iu khon4 ‘hair’ (hair that covers the
body) is more general concept and T2 rwu phom5
‘hair’ (hair that covers on the human head) is
more specific one.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8622575">
2.3.4 Grammar and usage differentiation
• Part of speech
• “Classifier” is one of Thai POS
which indicates the semantic

class to which an item belongs.
It&apos;s widely use in quantitative
expression. For example, ‘nu
knon’ used with &apos;person&apos;, ‘mir4
lang’ used with house.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.928825">
• Some adjectives in English, such
as ‘beautiful’, &apos;red&apos; and so on can
function as the adjective and at-
tribute verb in Thai.
• Social factors determining language us-
age
• In Thai, some social factors,
such as social status, age, or sex
play an important role to deter-
mine the usage of language. For
example, these following three
words riu kin0, G chan4 and Lmei
sa0-waey4, having the same
meaning ‘eat’, are used for dif-
ferent social status of the listener
or referent. These words cannot
be grouped in the same synset
because of their usage.

3 From Thai to Asian WordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999800736842105">
AWN, or Asian WordNet, is the result of the col-
laborative effort in creating an interconnected
WordNet for Asian languages. Starting with the
automatic synset assignment as shown in section
2, we provide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initia-
tor) (Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlam-
vanich et al., 2007) to establish an online col-
laborative work in refining the WorNets. KUI is
community software which allows registered
members including language experts revise and
vote for the synset assignment. The system man-
ages the synset assignment according to the pre-
ferred score obtained from the revision process.
As a result, the community WordNets will be
accomplished and exported into the original form
of WordNet database. Via the synset ID assigned
in the WordNet, the system can generate a cross
language WordNet result. Through this effort, an
initial version of Asian WordNet can be fulfilled.

In our language WordNet construction, lexical
entry of each language will be mapped with the
PWN via its English equivalent. On the process
of mapping, a unique ID will be generated for
every lexical entry which contains unique
sense_key and synset_offset from PWN. Exam-
ples of the generated ID show in Table 2. When
a word with a unique ID is translated into any
language, the same unique ID will be attached to
that word automatically. By this way, the lexicon
entry in the community can be linked to the each
other using this unique ID.

WordNet is a great inspiration in the extensive development of this kind of lexical database in other languages. It is not only an important resource in implementing NLP applications in each language, but also in inter-linking WordNets of different languages to develop multi-lingual applications to overcome the language barrier. There are some efforts in developing WordNets of some languages (Atserias and et al., 1997; Vossen, 1997; Farrers and et al., 1998; Balkova and et al., 2004; Isahara and et al., 2008). But the number of languages that have been successfully developed their WordNets is still limited to some active research in this area. This paper, however, is the one of that attempt. This paper describes semi-automatic construction of Thai WordNet and the applied method for Asian WordNet. Based on the Princeton WordNet, we develop a method in generating a WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual dictionary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-lingual dictionary through the English equivalent and its part-of-speech (P</context>

Both automatic and manual methods are applied in the process. 2.2.1 Automatic Synset Alignment Following the objective to translate the PWN to Thai, we attempted to use the existing lexical resources to facilitate the construction. We proposed an automatic method to assign an appropriate synset to a lexical entry by considering its English equivalent and lexical synonyms which are most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual dictionary. (Charoenporn 2008; Sornlertlamvanich, 2008). WordNet (synset) TE Dict (entry) total Assigned total assigned Noun 145,103 18,353 43,072 11,867 (13%) (28%) Verb 24,884 1,333 17,669 2,298 (5%) (13%) Adjective 31,302 4,034 18,448 3,722 (13%) (20%) Adverb 5,721 737 3,008 1,519 (13%) (51%) Total 207,010 24,457 82,197 19,406 (12%) (24%) Table 1. Synset assignment to entries in Thai-English dictionary For the result, there is only 12% of the total number of the synsets that were able to be assigned to Thai lexical entries. And about 24% of Thai lexical entries were found with the English equivalents that meet one of our criteria. Table 1 shows</context>
