Current information extraction efforts

focus on finding entities and facts in
structured databases or MEDLINE
abstracts. We apply a gene and

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903102564103">
The application of large-scale genomics and
proteomics technologies towards a wide variety
of biological questions has resulted in a
continuous stream of information regarding
thousands of genes and gene products into the
Medline database of biomedical abstracts. This
repository has been recognized as a rich
knowledge source for biological information
retrieval, information extraction and text mining.
However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannot
contain the same volume of information as the
full text articles that they represent. It was
recently shown that only 30% of protein
interactions contained in the Dictionary of
Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al.,
2000) could be found in Medline sentences
containing DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al.,
2000). This finding suggests that current
information extraction efforts being applied to
biomedical abstracts should be extended to full
text databases.
The basic task of identifying gene and
protein names is a necessary first step towards
making full use of the information encoded in
biomedical text. This remains a challenging
task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in
gene and protein nomenclature. The
irregularities are mainly the result of a lack of
naming conventions, as well as the widespread
practice of using many synonyms for one gene
or protein. A glance at the Nomenclature
section of the Nature Genetics website
(http://www.nature.com/ng/web_specials/nomen
/) shows the scope of the problem, as well as
ideas for addressing it. The nomenclature
guidelines implore authors to consult relevant
nomenclature committees before announcing
new genes, and to provide synonyms for genes
in abstracts. Additional rules specify that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.939096428571429">
4. Gene symbols are always italicised
and never contain hyphens, greek
letters, roman numerals, subscripts or
superscripts.
5. All letters in human genes are upper-
case...all letters in mouse genes are
lower-case...
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877406779661">
Unfortunately, we are currently at a stage
where these types of rules are not consistently
applied to most biomedical abstracts, let alone to
full text documents. Until the biomedical
community adheres uniformly to nomenclature
guidelines, ambiguities regarding gene/protein
names will continue to be an obstacle for natural
language processing of biomedical text. These
ambiguities become apparent at the
morphological, syntactic and semantic levels.
For example, caco-2 refers to a cell line, but
pai-1 is a gene name. Gene and protein names
can contain verbs and other parts of speech that
are hard to distinguish from the surrounding
text, as in deleted in azoospermia-like, son of
sevenless, ran, man, young arrest and never in
mitosis. Genes can be transfected into cells, or
combined with chemicals, resulting in
ambiguous terms like CHO-A(3) and
ca2+/calmodulin. The semantic notion of a gene
or protein is quite arbitrary – is
ACTTGGAATGACC a gene name? In addition
to sequences, there are mutations, motifs,
receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels,
chromosomal locations and disease loci to
consider. The domain-specific irregularities and
ambiguities just described are superimposed
upon the ambiguities in the natural language
itself, so it is not surprising that the
identification of gene and protein names in
biomedical text remains a difficult and
challenging task. The methodologies applied to
this fundamental problem include rule-based
and/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al.,
1998) (Thomas et al., 2000) (Yoshida et al.,
2000) (Jenssen et al., 2001) (Ono et al., 2001)
(Yu at al, 2002) (Bunescu et al., 2002), a
modified BLAST algorithm (Krauthammer et
al., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
(Collier et al., 2000) (Proux et al., 1998), Naive
Bayes and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999),
under specified parsing with knowledge sources
(Rindflesch et al, 2000), and context-free
grammars (Gaizauskas, 2000).
In this paper, we evaluate the application of a
gene and protein name tagger trained on
Medline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe and
Wilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of
1,000 PUBMEDCENTRAL (PMC) articles.
PMC is a digital archive of full text peer-
reviewed biomedical articles launched in
February 2000 by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the U.S.
National Library of Medicine (NLM®) (Roberts
et al., 2001). We present two adaptations made
in response to the greater heterogeneity of full
text, and evaluate how they affect the
performance of ABGene on a test set of 2600
full text sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.993144571428571">
We previously trained the Brill POS tagger
(Brill, 1994) to recognize protein and gene
names in biomedical text using a training set of
7,000 Medline sentences. We updated the
lexicon included in the Brill package (Brown
Corpus plus Wall Street Journal corpus) with
entries from the UMLS® SPECIALIST lexicon
(McCray et al. 1994, Humphreys et al. 1998),
and generated a list of bigrams and a word list
from all of MEDLINE to customize the training
for our purposes. ABGene processing begins by
using these automatically generated rules from
the Brill tagger to extract single word gene and
protein names from biomedical abstracts (see

<bodyText confidence="0.999886222222222">
This is followed by extensive filtering for false
positives and false negatives. A key step during
the filtering stage is the extraction of multi-word
gene and protein names that are prevalent in the
literature but inaccessible to the Brill tagger.
During the false positive filtering step, the
GENE tag is removed from a word if it matches
a term from a list of 1,505 precompiled general
biological terms (acids, antagonist, assembly,
antigen, etc.), 39 amino acid names, 233
restriction enzymes, 593 cell lines, 63,698
organism names from the NCBI Taxonomy
Database (Wheeler et al. 2000) or 4,357 non-
biological terms. Non-biological terms were
obtained by comparing word frequencies in
MEDLINE versus the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
using the following expression, where p is the
probability of occurrence:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.552573">
log(p(word occurs in MEDLINE)/ p(word occurs in WSJ) )&lt; 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959386363637">
Additional false positives are found by regular
expressions including numbers followed by
measurements (25 mg/ml) and common drug
suffixes (-ole, -ane, -ate, -ide, -ine, -ite, -ol, -ose,
cooh).
The false negative filter recovers a single
word name if it: 1) matches a list of 34,555
single word names and 7611 compound word
names compiled from LocusLink (Pruitt &amp;
Maglott 2001) and the Gene Ontology
Consortium (2000) (Wain et al., 2002) and
contains a good context word before or after the
name, or 2) contains a low frequency trigram
and a good context word before or after the
name. The context words were automatically
generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the
LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large
collection of texts in which these gene names
occur. We computed a log odds score or
Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words
indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent
gene name in the texts.
Compound word names are recovered using
terms that occur frequently in known gene
names. Recombination of these terms produce
compound words that also tend to be
gene/protein names. These terms include the
digits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals,
the Greek letters, functional descriptors
(adhesion), organism identifiers (hamster),
activity descriptors (promoting), placement
indicators (early), and generic descriptors
(light). In addition to the 415 exact terms, we
added regular expressions that allow for partial
matches or special patterns such as words
without vowels, words with numbers and letters,
words in capital letters, and common prefixes
and suffixes (-gene, -like, -ase).
Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996,
Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rank
documents by similarity to documents with
known gene/protein names. Documents below a
certain threshold are considered to have no
gene/protein names in them.

2.2 Modifications for Full Text Articles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984428571429">
The full text PMC articles are longer than
abstracts, and contain extraneous information
like grant numbers and laboratory reagents,
along with figures and tables. An attempt to
take windows of varying sizes of the full text in
order to rank the windows by similarity to
abstracts with known gene names was
unsuccessful. High scoring windows often hid
false positives, and low scoring windows could
contain gene and protein name contexts
infrequently encountered in Medline abstracts.
However, we determined that the classifier
could be used on the sentence level for full text
articles, and show the effect of an assumption
that sentences below a zero threshold do not
contain gene/protein names.
We tried to increase the performance of
ABGene on the PMC articles by adding a final
processing step. We ran ABGene on 2.16
million Medline abstracts similar to documents
with known gene names, and extracted 2.42
million unique gene/protein names. We counted
the number of times each unique name was
given the GENE tag by ABGene in the 2.16
million abstracts, and then extracted three
groups of putative gene/protein names from this
large set, with count thresholds at 10 (134,809
names), 100 (13,865 names) and 1000 (1136
names).
During the final stage of processing, terms in
sentences with scores greater than 2 are checked
against these lists of supposed gene/protein
names. We show the effect of tagging terms
with counts of at least 10, 100 and 1000 in the
putative gene/protein list.

3 Experiment and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982145625">
We evaluated the performance of ABGene
on 2600 PMC sentences from 13 score levels
ranging from –8 to 60+. No attempt was made
to narrow the set using query terms. The
sentences were selected as follows: half of the
test set consists of the first 100 sentences from
each score level, and the other half consists of
100 sentences selected at random from each
score level. Precision and recall results are
shown for each individual score range in Table
2, and cumulative results are shown in Table 3.
The number of words tested varies for each
score level because longer sentences tend to
have higher scores. Also, sentences with scores
near zero tend to be table or figure entries, with
only a few words each.

3.1 Problematic Areas in Full Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999263076923077">
The false positive gene/protein names found in
the PMC articles reveal new difficulties for the
basic task of identifying gene and protein names
in biomedical text. For example, in abstracts,
entities like restriction enzyme sites, laboratory
protocol kits, primers, vectors, molecular
biology supply companies and chemical
reagents are usually scarce. However, in the
methods section of a full document, they appear
regularly, adding to the morphological, syntactic
and semantic ambiguities previously mentioned.
Illustrative examples include bio-rad, centricon-
30 spin, xbai sites, mg2, geneamp and pgem3z.
A significant source of false negatives consists
of tables and figures from full text, which
completely lack contextual cues and/or indicator
words. These problems can be addressed by
eliminating processing of materials and methods
sections, tables and figures. Another significant
source of false negatives is an artifact of the
PMC format, for example, beta is translated to
[beta], thus a name like beta1 integrin becomes
[beta]1 integrin in PMC. This is easily
addressed by removing the PMC formatting
prior to processing, and has already been
completed for future work on PMC articles.

We conclude that an information extraction
system to tag gene and protein names in
Medline abstracts (ABGene) can be applied to
full text articles in the biomedical domain. We
have shown how modifications to the processing
(applying a sentence score threshold, and using
a large pool of putative gene/protein names) can
affect the system’s performance. We are
currently exploring methods to filter the 2.16
million putative gene/protein names extracted
from Medline using our system. The resulting
set of gene/protein names, a significant addition
to the 42K names available from the Gene
Ontology Consortium and LocusLink, will be
used to improve the performance of text

<abstract confidence="0.987491693430656">Current information extraction efforts in the biomedical domain tend to focus on finding entities and facts in databases or abstracts. We apply a gene and protein name tagger trained on Medline abstracts (ABGene) to a randomly selected set of full text journal articles in the biomedical domain. We show the effect of adaptations made in response to the greater heterogeneity of full text. The application of large-scale genomics and proteomics technologies towards a wide variety of biological questions has resulted in a continuous stream of information regarding thousands of genes and gene products into the Medline database of biomedical abstracts. This repository has been recognized as a rich knowledge source for biological information retrieval, information extraction and text mining. However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannot contain the same volume of information as the full text articles that they represent. It was recently shown that only 30% of protein interactions contained in the Dictionary of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al., 2000) could be found in Medline sentences containing DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al., 2000). This finding suggests that information extraction efforts being applied to biomedical abstracts should be extended to full text databases. The basic task of identifying gene and protein names is a necessary first step towards making full use of the information encoded in biomedical text. This remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature. The irregularities are mainly the result of a lack of naming conventions, as well as the widespread practice of using many synonyms for one gene protein. A glance at the the Genetics (http://www.nature.com/ng/web_specials/nomen /) shows the scope of the problem, as well as ideas for addressing it. The nomenclature guidelines implore authors to consult relevant nomenclature committees before announcing new genes, and to provide synonyms for genes in abstracts. Additional rules specify that: 4. Gene symbols are always and never contain hyphens, greek letters, roman numerals, subscripts or superscripts. All letters in human genes are case...all letters in mouse genes are lower-case... Unfortunately, we are currently at a stage where these types of rules are not consistently applied to most biomedical abstracts, let alone to full text documents. Until the biomedical community adheres uniformly to nomenclature guidelines, ambiguities regarding gene/protein names will continue to be an obstacle for natural language processing of biomedical text. These ambiguities become apparent at the morphological, syntactic and semantic levels. example, refers to a cell line, but is a gene name. Gene and protein names can contain verbs and other parts of speech that are hard to distinguish from the surrounding as in in of ran, man, young arrest in Genes can be transfected into cells, or combined with chemicals, resulting in terms like The semantic notion of a gene or protein is quite arbitrary – is gene name? In addition to sequences, there are mutations, motifs, receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels, chromosomal locations and disease loci to consider. The domain-specific irregularities and ambiguities just described are superimposed upon the ambiguities in the natural language itself, so it is not surprising that the identification of gene and protein names in biomedical text remains a difficult and challenging task. The methodologies applied to this fundamental problem include rule-based and/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al., 1998) (Thomas et al., 2000) (Yoshida et al., 2000) (Jenssen et al., 2001) (Ono et al., 2001) (Yu at al, 2002) (Bunescu et al., 2002), a modified BLAST algorithm (Krauthammer et al., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Collier et al., 2000) (Proux et al., 1998), Naive Bayes and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999), under specified parsing with knowledge sources (Rindflesch et al, 2000), and context-free grammars (Gaizauskas, 2000). In this paper, we evaluate the application of a gene and protein name tagger trained on Medline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of articles. PMC is a digital archive of full text peerreviewed biomedical articles launched in February 2000 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the U.S. Library of Medicine (Roberts et al., 2001). We present two adaptations made in response to the greater heterogeneity of full text, and evaluate how they affect the performance of ABGene on a test set of 2600 full text sentences. We first give an overview of ABGene’s method for extracting gene and protein names from biomedical citations, and then present some modifications to ABGene designed to improve its performance on full text articles. 2.1 ABGene Overview We previously trained the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1994) to recognize protein and gene names in biomedical text using a training set of 7,000 Medline sentences. We updated the lexicon included in the Brill package (Brown Corpus plus Wall Street Journal corpus) with from the lexicon (McCray et al. 1994, Humphreys et al. 1998), and generated a list of bigrams and a word list from all of MEDLINE to customize the training for our purposes. ABGene processing begins by using these automatically generated rules from the Brill tagger to extract single word gene and protein names from biomedical abstracts (see Table 1). Lexical Rule Description NNP gene fgoodleft GENE Change the tag of a word from NNP to GENE if the word gene can appear to the right -A hassuf 2 GENE Change the tag of a word from anything to GENE if it contains the suffix -A chaspref 2 GENE Change the tag of a word from anything to GENE if it contains the prefix c- GENE cell Change the tag of a word from GENE to NNP if the word cell can appear to the left fgoodright NNP Contextual Rule Description NNP GENE Change the tag of a wordfrom NNP to GENE if one PREV1OR2WD genes of the two preceding words is genes NNP GENE Change the tag of a wordfrom NNP to GENE if the NEXTBIGRAM ( two following words are tagged ( and GENE GENE CD GENE Change the tag of a word from CD to GENE if the preceding word is tagged CC and the following word is tagged ) SURROUNDTAG CC ) VBG JJ NEXTTAG GENE Change the tag of a word from VBG to JJ if the next word is tagged GENE 1. of lexical and contextual rules learned by the Brill tagger. NNP = proper noun, CD = cardinal number, CC = coordinating conjunction, JJ = adjective, VBG = verb, gerund/present participle This is followed by extensive filtering for false positives and false negatives. A key step during the filtering stage is the extraction of multi-word gene and protein names that are prevalent in the literature but inaccessible to the Brill tagger. During the false positive filtering step, the GENE tag is removed from a word if it matches a term from a list of 1,505 precompiled general biological terms (acids, antagonist, assembly, antigen, etc.), 39 amino acid names, 233 restriction enzymes, 593 cell lines, 63,698 organism names from the NCBI Taxonomy Database (Wheeler et al. 2000) or 4,357 nonbiological terms. Non-biological terms were obtained by comparing word frequencies in MEDLINE versus the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) using the following expression, where p is the probability of occurrence: log(p(word occurs in MEDLINE)/ p(word occurs in WSJ) )&lt; 1 Additional false positives are found by regular expressions including numbers followed by measurements (25 mg/ml) and common drug suffixes (-ole, -ane, -ate, -ide, -ine, -ite, -ol, -ose, cooh). The false negative filter recovers a single word name if it: 1) matches a list of 34,555 single word names and 7611 compound word names compiled from LocusLink (Pruitt &amp; Maglott 2001) and the Gene Ontology Consortium (2000) (Wain et al., 2002) and contains a good context word before or after the name, or 2) contains a low frequency trigram and a good context word before or after the name. The context words were automatically generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large collection of texts in which these gene names occur. We computed a log odds score or Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent gene name in the texts. Compound word names are recovered using terms that occur frequently in known gene names. Recombination of these terms produce compound words that also tend to be gene/protein names. These terms include the digits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals, the Greek letters, functional descriptors organism identifiers descriptors placement and generic descriptors addition to the 415 exact terms, we added regular expressions that allow for partial matches or special patterns such as words without vowels, words with numbers and letters, words in capital letters, and common prefixes suffixes -like, Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996, Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rank documents by similarity to documents with known gene/protein names. Documents below a certain threshold are considered to have no gene/protein names in them. 2.2 Modifications for Full Text Articles The full text PMC articles are longer than abstracts, and contain extraneous information like grant numbers and laboratory reagents, along with figures and tables. An attempt to take windows of varying sizes of the full text in order to rank the windows by similarity to abstracts with known gene names was unsuccessful. High scoring windows often hid false positives, and low scoring windows could contain gene and protein name contexts infrequently encountered in Medline abstracts. However, we determined that the classifier could be used on the sentence level for full text articles, and show the effect of an assumption that sentences below a zero threshold do not contain gene/protein names. We tried to increase the performance of ABGene on the PMC articles by adding a final processing step. We ran ABGene on 2.16 million Medline abstracts similar to documents with known gene names, and extracted 2.42 million unique gene/protein names. We counted the number of times each unique name was given the GENE tag by ABGene in the 2.16 million abstracts, and then extracted three groups of putative gene/protein names from this large set, with count thresholds at 10 (134,809 names), 100 (13,865 names) and 1000 (1136 names). During the final stage of processing, terms in sentences with scores greater than 2 are checked against these lists of supposed gene/protein names. We show the effect of tagging terms with counts of at least 10, 100 and 1000 in the putative gene/protein list. and Results We evaluated the performance of ABGene on 2600 PMC sentences from 13 score levels ranging from –8 to 60+. No attempt was made to narrow the set using query terms. The sentences were selected as follows: half of the test set consists of the first 100 sentences from each score level, and the other half consists of 100 sentences selected at random from each score level. Precision and recall results are shown for each individual score range in Table 2, and cumulative results are shown in Table 3. The number of words tested varies for each score level because longer sentences tend to have higher scores. Also, sentences with scores near zero tend to be table or figure entries, with only a few words each.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.999170844444444">3. precision and recall using the score as a lower threshold. 3.1 Problematic Areas in Full Text The false positive gene/protein names found in the PMC articles reveal new difficulties for the basic task of identifying gene and protein names in biomedical text. For example, in abstracts, entities like restriction enzyme sites, laboratory protocol kits, primers, vectors, molecular biology supply companies and chemical reagents are usually scarce. However, in the methods section of a full document, they appear regularly, adding to the morphological, syntactic and semantic ambiguities previously mentioned. examples include centriconspin, xbai sites, mg2, geneamp A significant source of false negatives consists of tables and figures from full text, which completely lack contextual cues and/or indicator words. These problems can be addressed by eliminating processing of materials and methods sections, tables and figures. Another significant source of false negatives is an artifact of the format, for example, translated to thus a name like integrin integrin PMC. This is easily addressed by removing the PMC formatting prior to processing, and has already been completed for future work on PMC articles. We conclude that an information extraction system to tag gene and protein names in Medline abstracts (ABGene) can be applied to full text articles in the biomedical domain. We have shown how modifications to the processing (applying a sentence score threshold, and using a large pool of putative gene/protein names) can affect the system’s performance. We are currently exploring methods to filter the 2.16 million putative gene/protein names extracted from Medline using our system. The resulting set of gene/protein names, a significant addition to the 42K names available from the Gene Ontology Consortium and LocusLink, will be used to improve the performance of text processing on full text articles in the biomedical domain.</abstract>

The context words were automatically generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large collection of texts in which these gene names occur. We computed a log odds score or Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent gene name in the texts.

The context words were automatically generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large collection of texts in which these gene names occur. We computed a log odds score or Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent gene name in the texts. Compound word names are recovered using terms that occur frequently in known gene names. Recombination of these terms pr</context>

A key step during the filtering stage is the extraction of multi-word gene and protein names that are prevalent in the literature but inaccessible to the Brill tagger. During the false positive filtering step, the GENE tag is removed from a word if it matches a term from a list of 1,505 precompiled general biological terms (acids, antagonist, assembly, antigen, etc.), 39 amino acid names, 233 restriction enzymes, 593 cell lines, 63,698 organism names from the NCBI Taxonomy Database (Wheeler et al. 2000) or 4,357 nonbiological terms. Non-biological terms were obtained by comparing word frequencies in MEDLINE versus the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) using the following expression, where p is the probability of occurrence: log(p(word occurs in MEDLINE)/ p(word occurs in WSJ) )&lt; 1 Additional false positives are found by regular expressions including numbers followed by measurements (25 mg/ml) and common drug suffixes (-ole, -ane, -ate, -ide, -ine, -ite, -ol, -ose, cooh).

These terms include the digits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals, the Greek letters, functional descriptors (adhesion), organism identifiers (hamster), activity descriptors (promoting), placement indicators (early), and generic descriptors (light). In addition to the 415 exact terms, we added regular expressions that allow for partial matches or special patterns such as words without vowels, words with numbers and letters, words in capital letters, and common prefixes and suffixes (-gene, -like, -ase). Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996, Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rank documents by similarity to documents with known gene/protein names. Documents below a certain threshold are considered to have no gene/protein names in them. 2.2 Modifications for Full Text Articles The full text PMC articles are longer than abstracts, and contain extraneous information like grant numbers and laboratory reagents, along with figures and tables. An attempt to take windows of varying sizes of the full text in order to rank the windows by similarity to abstracts with known gene names was unsuccessful. High scoring windows often hid false positives, and low scor</context>

This repository has been recognized as a rich knowledge source for biological information retrieval, information extraction and text mining. However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannot contain the same volume of information as the full text articles that they represent. It was recently shown that only 30% of protein interactions contained in the Dictionary of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al., 2000) could be found in Medline sentences containing DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al., 2000). This finding suggests that current information extraction efforts being applied to biomedical abstracts should be extended to full text databases. The basic task of identifying gene and protein names is a necessary first step towards making full use of the information encoded in biomedical text. This remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature. The irregularities are mainly the result of a lack of naming conventions, as well as the widespread prac</context>

In addition to sequences, there are mutations, motifs, receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels, chromosomal locations and disease loci to consider. The domain-specific irregularities and ambiguities just described are superimposed upon the ambiguities in the natural language itself, so it is not surprising that the identification of gene and protein names in biomedical text remains a difficult and challenging task. The methodologies applied to this fundamental problem include rule-based and/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al., 1998) (Thomas et al., 2000) (Yoshida et al., 2000) (Jenssen et al., 2001) (Ono et al., 2001) (Yu at al, 2002) (Bunescu et al., 2002), a modified BLAST algorithm (Krauthammer et al., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Collier et al., 2000) (Proux et al., 1998), Naive Bayes and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999), under specified parsing with knowledge sources (Rindflesch et al, 2000), and context-free grammars (Gaizauskas, 2000). In this paper, we evaluate the application of a gene and protein name tagger trained on Medline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of 1,000 PUBMEDCENTRAL (PMC) articles.
