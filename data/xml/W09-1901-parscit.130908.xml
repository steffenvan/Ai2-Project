In this paper we present our experiments with
active learning to improve the performance
of our probabilistic anaphora resolution sys-
tem. We have adopted entropy-based uncer-
tainty measures to select new instances to be
added to our training data. The actively se-
lected instances, however, were not more suc-
cessful in improving the performance of the
system than the same amount of randomly se-
lected instances. The uncertainty measures
we used behave differently from each other
when selecting new instances, but none of
them achieved remarkable performance. Fur-
ther studies on active sample selection for
anaphora resolution are necessary.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998078">
Anaphora is the relation between two linguistic ex-
pressions in the discourse where the reader is re-
ferred back to the first of them when reading the sec-
ond later in the text. Anaphora resolution can be un-
derstood as the process of identifying an anaphoric
relation between two expressions in the text and con-
sequently linking the two of them, one being the
anaphor and the other being the antecedent. Man-
ually annotating corpora with anaphoric links in or-
der to use it as training or test data for a corpus-based
anaphora resolution system is a particulary difficult
and time consuming task, given the complex nature
of the phenomenon.
We have developed a probabilistic model for res-
olution of non-pronominal anaphora and aim to im-
prove its performance by acquiring incrementally
and selectively more training data using active learn-
ing. We have adopted an uncertainty-based active
learning approach in order to do that, and it uses our
probabilistic model as the base classifier.
The uncertainty-based approach has been applied
to, for instance, named-entity recognition by Shen et
al. (2004) who report at least 80% reduction in an-
notation costs, parsing by Tang et al. (2002) who re-
ports 67% savings, and parse selection by Baldridge
and Osborne (2003) who report 60% savings. We
are not aware of any work that has applied active
learning to anaphora resolution.
For calculating the uncertainty of an anaphora res-
olution model, we feel the need to combine the in-
formation about the confindence of the model for
the classification of each antecedent candidate as-
sociated to a given anaphor. We have tested three
entropy-based uncertainty measures in order to se-
lect the instances to be added to the training data.
Our training corpus is composed of five full-
length scientific articles from the biomedical do-
main. We have used this corpus to simulate active
learning: we have divided our training data into two
parts, one for the initial training and the other for ac-
tive learning (simulating unlabelled data), and have
compared the classifier performance when trained
on a sample selected by active learning to its per-
formance when trained on the same amount of ran-
domly selected instances.
In the next section we describe our probabilistic
model for anaphora resolution. In Section 3 we de-
tail our training corpus. In Section ?? we describe
the strategy we have adopted to select the samples
to take part in the active learning, and in Section 5

2 Anaphora resolution model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953313432836">
We have inplemented a probabilistic model for
anaphora resolution in the biomedical domain
(Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008). This model aims to
resolve both coreferent and associative (also called
bridging (Poesio and Vieira, 1998)) cases of non-
pronominal anaphora. Table 1 shows examples of
these types of anaphoric relations. Coreferent are
the cases in which the anaphor and the antecedent
refer to the same entity in the world, while associa-
tive cases are the ones in which the anaphor and an-
tecedent refer to different but somehow related en-
tities. We only take into account noun phrases re-
ferring to biomedical entities, since this was the fo-
cus of our resolution model. We consider two types
of associative relations: biotype relations, which
are anaphoric associative relations between noun
phrases that share specific ontological relations in
the biomedical domain; and set-member relations,
in which the noun phrases share a set-membership
relation. It is frequent however that some noun
phrases do not have an antecedent, these are con-
sidered discourse-new cases, which we also aim to
identify.
The probabilistic model results from a simple de-
composition process applied to a conditional proba-
bility equation that involves several parameters (fea-
tures). It is inspired by Ge et al.’s (1998) probabilis-
tic model for pronoun resolution. The decomposi-
tion makes use of Bayes’ theorem and independence
assumptions, and aims to decrease the impact of data
sparseness on the model, so that even small train-
ing corpora can be viable. The decomposed model
can be thought of as a more sophisticated version
of the naive-Bayes algorithm, since we consider the
dependence among some of the features instead of
full independence as in naive Bayes. Probabilistic
models can return a confidence measure (probabil-
ity) for each decision they make, which allow us to
adopt techniques such as active learning for further
processing.
Our model seeks to classify the relation between
an anaphoric expression and an antecedent candi-
date as coreferent, biotype, set-member or neither.
It computes the probability of each pair of anaphor
and candidate for each class. The candidate with the
highest overall probability for each class is selected
as the antecedent for that class, or no antecedent is
selected if the probability of no relation overcomes
the positive probabilities; in this case, the expression
is considered to be new to the discourse.
We have chosen 11 features to describe the
anaphoric relations between an antecedent candi-
date a and an anaphor A. The features are pre-
sented in Table 2. Most features are domain-
independent, while one, gpa,A, is specific for the
biomedical domain. Our feature set covers the basic
aspects that influence anaphoric relations: the form
of the anaphor’s NP, string matching, semantic class
matching, number agreement, and distance.
Given these features, we compute the probability
P of an specific class of anaphoric relation C be-
tween a (antecedent candidate) and A (anaphor). For
each pair of a given anaphor and an antecedent can-
didate we compute P for C=‘coreferent’, C=‘biotype’,
and C=‘set-member’. We also compute C=‘none’, that
represents the probability of no relation between the
NPs. P can be defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.946198">
P(C = ‘class’|fA, fa, hma,A, hmma,A, mma,A,
numa,A, sra, bma,A, gpa,A, da,A, dma,A)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999285181818182">
If we were to use P as above we would suffer con-
siderably data sparseness. In order to reduce that, we
decompose the probability P and assume indepen-
dence among some of the features in order to handle
the sparseness of the training data. For more detail
on the decomposition process refer to (Gasperin and
Briscoe, 2008).
Applying Bayes’ rule and selectively applying the
chain rule to the above equation, as well as assum-
ing independece among some features, we reach the
following equation:

There are very few biomedical corpora annotated
with anaphora information, and all of them are built
from paper abstracts (Cohen et al., 2005), instead of
full papers. As anaphora is a phenomenon that de-
velops through a text, we believe that short abstracts
are not the best source to work with and decided to
concentrate on full papers.
In order to collect the statistics to train our model,
we have manually annotated anaphoric relations
between biomedical entities in 5 full-text articles
(approx. 33,300 words)1, which are part of the
Drosophila molecular biology literature. The corpus
and annotation process are described in (Gasperin et
al., 2007). To the best of our knowledge, this corpus

is the first corpus of biomedical full-text articles to
be annotated with anaphora information.
Before annotating anaphora, we have prepro-
cessed the articles in order to (1) tag gene names,
(2) identify all NPs, and (3) classify the NPs accord-
ing to their domain type, which we call biotype. To
tag all gene names in the corpus, we have applied
the gene name recogniser developed by Vlachos et
al. (2006). To identify all NPs, their subconstituents
(head, modifiers, determiner) and broader pre- and
post-modification patterns, we have used the RASP
parser (Briscoe et al., 2006). To classify the NPs ac-
cording to their type in biomedical terms, we have
adopted the Sequence Ontology (SO)2 (Eilbeck and
Lewis, 2004). SO is a fine-grained ontology, which
contains the names of practically all entities that par-
ticipate in genomic sequences, besides the relations
among these entities (e.g. is-a, part-of, derived-from
relations). We derived from SO seven biotypes to
be used to classify the entities in the text, namely:
“gene”, “gene product”, “part of gene”, “part of
product”, “gene variant”, “gene subtype”, and “gene

supertype”. We also created the biotype “other-bio”
to be associated with noun phrases that contain a
gene name (identified by the gene name recogniser)
but whose head noun does not fit any of the other
biotypes. All NPs were tagged with their biotypes,
and NPs for which no biotypes were found were ex-
cluded.
The gene-name tags, NP boundaries and biotypes
resulting from the preprocessing phase were revised
and corrected by hand before the anaphoric relations
were annotated.
For each biotyped NP we annotated its closest
coreferent antecedent (if found) and its closest as-
sociative antecedent (if found), from one of the as-
sociative classes. From our annotation, we can infer
coreference chains by merging the coreferent links
between mentions of a same entity.
The annotated relations, and the features derived
from them, are used as training data for the proba-
bilistic model above. A special characteristic of data
annotated with anaphora information is the over-
whelming amount of negative instances, which re-
sult from the absence of an anaphoric relation be-
tween a NP that precedes an anaphoric expression
and was not marked as its antecedent (nor marked as
part of the same coreference chain of its antecedent).
The negative instances outnumber considerably the
number of positive instances (annotated cases). Ta-
ble 3 presents the distribution of the cases among the
classes of anaphoric relations.
To balance the ratio between positive and nega-
tive training samples, we have clustered the negative
samples and kept only a portion of each cluster,
proportional to its size. All negative samples that
have the same values for all features are grouped
together (consequently, a cluster is formed by a set
of identical samples) and only one-tenth of each
cluster members is kept, resulting in 85,314 negative
samples. This way, small clusters (with less than
10 members), which are likely to represent noisy
samples (similar to positive ones), are eliminated,
and bigger clusters are shrunk; however the shape of
the distribution of the negative samples is preserved.
For example, our biggest cluster (feature values
are: fA=‘pn’, fa=‘pn’, hm=‘no’, hmm=‘no‘,
mm=‘no’, bm=‘yes’, gp=‘yes’, num=‘yes’,
sr=‘none’, d=‘16&lt;’, dm=‘50&lt;’) with 33,998
instances is reduced to 3,399 – still considerably
more numerous than any positive sample. Other
works have used a different strategy to reduce the
imbalance between positive and negative samples
(Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube
et al., 2002), where only samples composed by a
negative antecedent that is closer than the annotated
one are considered. Our strategy is more flexible
and is able to the reduce further the number of neg-
ative samples. The higher the number of negative
samples, the higher the precision of the resolution,
but the lower the recall.

When trained using all our annotated corpus on a 10-
fold cross-validation setting our anaphora resolution
model, presented above, reached the results shown
in Table 43.
We would like to improve this results without hav-
ing to annotate too much more data, therefore we
decided to experiment with active learning. We de-
fined three entropy-based measures to calculate the
uncertanty of our model for each decidion is makes.

4.1 Uncertainty measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821954545455">
In order to measure how confident our model is
about the class it assigns to each candidate, and con-
sequently the one it chooses as the antecedent of an
anaphor, we experiment with the following entropy-
based measures.
We first compute what we call the “local en-
tropy” among the probabilities for each class—
P(C=“coreferent”), P(C=“biotype”), P(C=“set-
member”) and P(C=“none”)—for a given pair
anaphor(A)-candidate(a), which is defined as
entropy of the pair is (given that when distance in-
creases, the probability of the candidate not being
the antecedent, P(C=“none”), also increases), and
consequently the less it contributes to the global en-
tropy. This is the intuition behind GE1(A).
However, in some cases, mainly when the
anaphor is a proper name, there can be several can-
didates at a long distance from the anaphor that still
get a reasonable probability assigned to them due
to positive string matching. Therefore we decided to
experiment with averaging the sum of the local prob-
abilities by the number of candidates, so GE2(A).

where P(C) represents Equation 1 above, that is, the
probability assigned to the anaphor-candidate rela-
tion by our probabilistic model for a particular class.
The more similar the probabilities are, the more un-
certain the model is about the relation, so the higher
the local entropy. This measure is similar to others
used in previous work for different problems.
We also compute the “global entropy” of the
distribution of candidates across classes for each
anaphor. The global entropy aims to combine the
uncertainty information from all antecedent candi-
dates for a given anaphor (instead of considering
only a single candidate-anaphor pair as for LE). The
higher the global entropy, the higher the uncertainty
of the model about the antecedent for an anaphor.
The global entropy combines the local entropies for
all antecedent candidates of a given anaphor. We
propose two versions of the global entropy measure.
The first is simply a sum of the local entropies of all
candidates available for a given anaphor, it is defined
as

We consider that in general the further away a

Initially, our training data was divided in 10-folds
for cross-validation evaluation of our probabilis-
tic model for anaphora resolution. For the active
learning experiments we kept the same folds, us-
ing one for the initial training, eight for the ac-
tive learning phase, and the remaining one for test-
ing. We have experimented with 10 different initial-
training/active-learning/testing splits, selected ran-
domly from all combinations of the 10 folds, and
the results in this section correspond to the average
of the results from the different data splits. A fold
contains the positive and negative samples derived
from about 270 anaphors, it contains about 7000
candidate-anaphor pairs (an average of about 26 an-
tecedent candidates per anaphor). The anaphors that
are part of each fold were randomly selected.
The purpose of our experiments is to check
whether the samples selected by using the entropy-
based measures described above, when added to our
training data, can improve the performance of the
model more than in the case of adding the same
amount of randomly selected samples. For that,
we computed (1) the performance of our model us-
ing one fold of training data, (2) the performance
of the model over 10 iterations of active learning
using each of the uncertainty measures above, and
(3) the performance of the model over 10 iterations
adding the same amount of randomly selected in-
stances as for active learning. At each active learn-
ing iteration, when using LE(A, a) we selected
the 1500 candidate-anaphor pairs for which uncer-
tainty was the highest, and when using GE1(A) and
GE2(A) we selected the 50 anaphors for which the

model was most uncertain and generated the posi-
tive and negative instances that were associated to
the anaphors.
We expected (2), entropy-based sample selection,
to achieve better performance than (3), random sam-
ple selection, however this has not happened. The
graphs in Figure 1 compare the precision, recall and
F-measure scores for (2) and (3) along the 10 it-
erations for each class of anaphoric relation. The
lines corresponding to random sampling plot the re-
sults of the experiments done in the same way as for
GE1(A) and GE2(A), that is, where 50 anaphors
are selected at each iteration, although we also tested
random sampling in the LE(A, a) fashion, selecting
1500 candidate-anaphor pairs.
We observe that none of the uncertainty measures
that we tested have performed consistently better
than random sampling. LE(A, a) presents the most
dramatic results, it worsens the general performance
of the model for all classes, although it causes a
considerable increase in precision for coreferent and
set-member cases. GE1(A) and GE2(A) have a
less clear pattern, but it is possible to notice that
GE1(A) tends to bring improvements in precision
while GE2(A) causes the opposite, improvements
in recall and drops in precision.

When looking at the instances selected by each ac-
tive learning strategy, we observe the following.
LE(A, a), which considers anaphor-candidate pairs,
selects mostly negative instances, given the fact that
these are highly frequent. This can explain the in-
crease in precision and drop in recall for the posi-
tive cases (observed for coreferent and set-member,
the most frequent positive classes), since that is ex-
pected with the increase of negative instances.
GE1(A) and GE2(A) select a proportional num-
ber of positive and negative instances, since these
measures consider an anaphor and all possible an-
tecedent candidates, generating all instances that de-
rive from each selected anaphor (usually one or two
positive intances and several negative ones). How-
ever, we can observe some differences between the
impact of using GE1(A) and GE2(A) to select in-
stances. We observe that about 70% of the sam-
ples selected by GE1(A) were proper names, while
the distribution of NP types among the samples se-
lected by GE2(A) is similar to the original distri-
bution in the data. This confirms the problem we
expected to have with GE1(A), since exact matches
of proper names that occur at a considerable distance
from the anaphor still get a higher probability as-
signed to them, which does not happen so often with
other types of NPs. On the other hand, the correct
antecedent of about 30% of GE2(A)-selected sam-
ples were in the same sentence as the anaphor, while
the same occurs with only 8% of GE1(A)-selected
samples. GE2(A) behaviour in this case is counter
intuitive, since antecedents in the same sentence
should be found by the model with lower uncertainty
than antecedents further away from the anaphor. An-
other counter intuitive behaviour of GE2(A) is that
only 3% of the selected anaphors have no string
matching with their antecedents (33% have no head-
noun matching), while these cases correspond to
about 30% of samples selected by GE1(A) (62%
of samples have no head-noun matching). We ex-
pected samples involving no string matching to be
selected because they are usually the ones the model
is mostly uncertain about.
Despite the different behaviour among the mea-
sures none was successful in improving the perfor-
mance of the model in relation to the performance
of random sampling.
While entropy-based measures for sample selec-
tion seem the obvious option given that we use a
probabilistic model, they did not give positive re-
sults in our case. A future study of different ways to
combine the local entropies is necessary, as well as
the study of other non-entropy-based measures for
sample selection.
The main difference between our application of
active learning to anaphora resolution and previous
successful applications of active learning to other
tasks is the amount of probabilities involved in the
calculation of the uncertainty of the model. We be-
lieve this is the reason why our active learning ex-
periments were not succesfull. While, for example,
name entity recognition involves a binary decision,
and parse selection involves a few parsing options,
in our case there are several antecedent candidates
to be considered. For anaphora resolution, when us-
ing a pairwise resolution model, it is necessary to
combine the predictions for one candidate-anaphor

We have adopted entropy-based uncertainty measures to select new instances to be added to our training data. The actively selected instances, however, were not more successful in improving the performance of the system than the same amount of randomly selected instances. The uncertainty measures we used behave differently from each other when selecting new instances, but none of them achieved remarkable performance. Further studies on active sample selection for anaphora resolution are necessary.</abstract>

We have developed a probabilistic model for resolution of non-pronominal anaphora and aim to improve its performance by acquiring incrementally and selectively more training data using active learning. We have adopted an uncertainty-based active learning approach in order to do that, and it uses our probabilistic model as the base classifier. The uncertainty-based approach has been applied to, for instance, named-entity recognition by Shen et al. (2004) who report at least 80% reduction in annotation costs, parsing by Tang et al. (2002) who reports 67% savings, and parse selection by Baldridge and Osborne (2003) who report 60% savings. We are not aware of any work that has applied active learning to anaphora resolution. For calculating the uncertainty of an anaphora resolution model, we feel the need to combine the information about the confindence of the model for the classification of each antecedent candidate associated to a given anaphor. We have tested three entropy-based uncertainty measures in order to select the instances to be added to the training data.

To tag all gene names in the corpus, we have applied the gene name recogniser developed by Vlachos et al. (2006). To identify all NPs, their subconstituents (head, modifiers, determiner) and broader pre- and post-modification patterns, we have used the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006). To classify the NPs according to their type in biomedical terms, we have adopted the Sequence Ontology (SO)2 (Eilbeck and Lewis, 2004). SO is a fine-grained ontology, which contains the names of practically all entities that participate in genomic sequences, besides the relations among these entities (e.g. is-a, part-of, derived-from relations).

This model aims to resolve both coreferent and associative (also called bridging (Poesio and Vieira, 1998)) cases of nonpronominal anaphora. Table 1 shows examples of these types of anaphoric relations. Coreferent are the cases in which the anaphor and the antecedent refer to the same entity in the world, while associative cases are the ones in which the anaphor and antecedent refer to different but somehow related entities. We only take into account noun phrases referring to biomedical entities, since this was the focus of our resolution model. We consider two types of associative relations</context>

We also compute C=‘none’, that represents the probability of no relation between the NPs. P can be defined as follows: P(C = ‘class’|fA, fa, hma,A, hmma,A, mma,A, numa,A, sra, bma,A, gpa,A, da,A, dma,A) If we were to use P as above we would suffer considerably data sparseness. In order to reduce that, we decompose the probability P and assume independence among some of the features in order to handle the sparseness of the training data. For more detail on the decomposition process refer to (Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008). Applying Bayes’ rule and selectively applying the chain rule to the above equation, as well as assuming independece among some features, we reach the following equation: P(C|fA, fa, hm, hmm, mm, num, sr, bm, gp, d, dm) = P(C) P(fA|C) P(fa|C, fA) P(d, dm|C, fA, fa) P(sr|C, d, dm) P(bm, gp|C) P(num|C, fA, fa) P(hm, hmm, mm|C, fA, fa, bm) P(fA) P(fa|fA) P(d, dm|fA, fa) P(sr|d, dm) P(bm, gp) P(num|fA, fa) P(hm, hmm,mm|fA, fa, bm) (1) 2 C “The expression of reaper has been shown ... the gene encodes ...

Other works have used a different strategy to reduce the imbalance between positive and negative samples (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube et al., 2002), where only samples composed by a negative antecedent that is closer than the annotated one are considered. Our strategy is more flexible and is able to the reduce further the number of negative samples. The higher the number of negative samples, the higher the precision of the resolution, but the lower the recall. 4 Active learning When trained using all our annotated corpus on a 10- fold cross-validation setting our anaphora resolution model, presented above, reached the results shown in Table 43.

Other works have used a different strategy to reduce the imbalance between positive and negative samples (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube et al., 2002), where only samples composed by a negative antecedent that is closer than the annotated one are considered.

We have developed a probabilistic model for resolution of non-pronominal anaphora and aim to improve its performance by acquiring incrementally and selectively more training data using active learning. We have adopted an uncertainty-based active learning approach in order to do that, and it uses our probabilistic model as the base classifier. The uncertainty-based approach has been applied to, for instance, named-entity recognition by Shen et al. (2004) who report at least 80% reduction in annotation costs, parsing by Tang et al. (2002) who reports 67% savings, and parse selection by Baldridge and Osborne (2003) who report 60% savings. We are not aware of any work that has applied active learning to anaphora resolution. For calculating the uncertainty of an anaphora resolution model, we feel the need to combine the information about the confindence of the model for the classification of each antecedent candidate associated to a given anaphor. We have tested three entropy-based uncertainty measures in order to select the instances to be added to the training data. Our training corpus is composed of five fulllength scientific </context>
