This paper proposes two decision trees for de-
termining the meanings of the prepositional
uses of over by using the contextual informa-
tion. It first examines the meanings of the
prepositional uses of over and then aims at
identifying the contexts for interpreting the
meanings. Some contexts are complementary
features, and that makes the decision trees sim-
ple. The trees have been tested on a corpus, and
the results are encouraging.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995285880952381">
Prepositions have been studied from a variety of per-
spectives. The syntactic status has been probed by such
linguists as Jackendoff [77], Emonds [85], Rauh [93]
and Pullum and Huddleston [02]. Cognitive theorists
have paid attention to the polysemous nature of preposi-
tions and explored the conceptual relationships of the
polysemy, often proposing the graphical mental images
(Lakoff and Johnson [80], Brugman [81, 88], Herskovits
[86], Langacker [87], Tyler and Evans [01]). Pragmatic
aspects of prepositions have been studied by such schol-
ars as Fauconnier [94] and Visetti and Cadiot [02]. The
deictic properties of spatial prepositions have been ex-
amined by Hill [82], while the geographical information
provided by them was an interest of computational re-
search (Xu and Badler [00], Tezuka et al [01]). A prac-
tical study of the usage of prepositions was carried out
for the purpose of teaching English as a second lan-
guage (Wahlen [95], Lindstromberg [97], Yates [99]).
In the fields related to natural language processing,
prepositional phrase attachment has been a topic for
research for quite a long time, and in recent years, the
problem was explored with a neural network-based ap-
proach (Sopena, LLoberas and Moliner [98]) and with a
syntax-based trainable approach (Yeh and Valin [98]).
Although past research has revealed various aspects of
prepositions, to my knowledge there is not much seman-
tic research of prepositions available for computational
use, which requires a vigorous formalization of repre-
senting the semantics.
A recent semantic study of prepositions for computa-
tional use is found in Voss [02], with a focus on spatial
prepositions. Spatial prepositions are divided into three
categories according to which one of the two thematic
meanings between place and path they acquire when
they are in argument, adjunct and non-subcategorized
positions of particular types of verbs. The semantics of
spatial prepositions dealt with in Voss [02] is not lexical
but thematic.
The present study places more focus on the lexical
meanings of prepositions rather than on the thematic
meanings because it is intended for use in machine
translation (MT), where the meaning of a sentence, a
phrase or a lexical entry of a source language must be
preserved in the target language, even though it may
take a different syntactic form in the source and target
languages. The preservation of meaning is even more
important at an Interlingua-based MT, because meaning
is a medium of translation between source and target
languages.
The current research deals with the prepositional
uses of over, but not with the uses of over in different
syntactic categories such as the use as adjective (as in
The initial test is over), as part of a phrasal verb (as in
He handed over his notes to me), as part of an idiomatic
phrase (as in She said it over and over) and as a modi-
fier of a quantity (as in over forty years ago). These
uses could be identified in terms of their syntactic char-
acteristics. On the other hand, the prepositional uses are
grouped under the same syntactic category, but exhibit
different meanings in different semantic contexts, re-
quiring semantic treatments as well for the disambigua-
tion of the senses.
This paper examines the meanings of the preposi-
tional uses of over, identifies the semantic contexts, and
proposes two decision trees for interpreting the different
meanings. The second section will divide the preposi-
tional uses of over into two groups according to which
one of the two functional units between Head and Com-
plement is likely to identity the meanings. It will also
bring into light the semantic features of the Head and
Complement components that make the interpretations
of the uses possible. The third section will discusses the
two decision trees proposed in this paper, and the fourth
section gives an evaluation of the trees, before conclud-
ing this paper.
2 Meanings of the prepositional uses
Prepositional uses of over could be divided into two
groups: those whose meaning is likely to be identified
by the Complement noun phrases and those that need
semantic information in the Head components. The
noun phrase following a preposition is the Complement
of the preposition, whereas the verb, verb phrase, noun
or noun phrase governing a preposition or a preposi-
tional phrase is the Head.

2.1 Over identified by its Complement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999245">
Unlike the uses of over governed or required by the
Head verb or noun, over the weekend in They have been
unwell over the weekend can appear with almost all se-
mantic classes of verbs, as illustrated below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99752625">
(1) a. I heard over the weekend of a terrible fuss.
b. He thought about it over the weekend
and accepted.
c. Talks with bankers were taking place
over the weekend.
d. It probably began over the weekend
of March 27.
e. His father had died over the weekend.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.965003875">
f. American diplomats arrived here over
the weekend.
The phrase over the weekend appears with a sensation
verb (1a), a cognition verb (1b), an occurrence verb (1c),
an aspectual verb (1d), a change of state verb (1e) and a
movement verb (1f). This suggests that over the week-
end is not required by a particular semantic class of
verbs. At the same time, it is likely to be identified from
the semantic features of the Complement noun phrase,
which denotes a definite period of time in discourse
during which an event takes place. This use of over is
called over_during because it is similar to the usage of
during.
On the other hand, over can appear with the Com-
plement denoting an indefinite period of time in dis-
course, as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9215495">
(2) Altogether, tutorials take place over a period of
about twenty-four weeks.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978422125">
The Complements of over_during in (1) and this use
share the semantic characteristic by referring to time of
duration, but differ in that the former refers to a specific
period of time in discourse while the latter only a length
of time over which an event continues. This use is
named over_duration.
Another use that denotes a length of time is as fol-
lows:

<bodyText confidence="0.992688857142857">
may be done over coffee.
Unlike the other two we have seen above, the Comple-
ment does not refer directly to a space of time, but still
the prepositional phrase implies an interval of time, in
particular the duration of drinking coffee. Like the use
of over_duration, the Complement does not refer to a
definite period in discourse because the semantic func-
tion is to indicate a length of time. The Complement in
this type is characterized by its meaning denoting meal
or drink as well as by referring to a nonspecific meal or
drink in discourse. This use is termed over_coffee.
Like the three uses we have seen above, the follow-
ing is also likely to be identified by the syntax and se-
mantics of the Complements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.723096">
(4) We heard the news over the radio at lunch
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972513090909091">
break.
The phrase over the radio indicates a means of hear-
ing the news. The Complement in this use is often a
sequence of the definite particle the followed by a noun
denoting a device of communication such as radio and
telephone. Although the Head verb or noun tends to
refer to a communicative act, as this use takes a Com-
plement with distinctive semantic features, it should
belong to this group. It is called over_means.
Another use of over that could belong to this group
is the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.895889">
(5) You can go all over the place.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999204">
The Complement denotes a place in many cases, but
sometimes a physical object, and this use of over is al-
ways preceded by all. Although the Head verb or noun
tends to denote movement, this use also appears with
other types of predicates, as illustrated below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991519333333333">
(6) a. Paint all over the studio.
b. He is known all over Europe.
c. Tapes crash all over my desk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999631666666667">
The following is a list of the prepositional uses of
over that are likely to be identified by the semantic fea-
tures of the Complements:

2.2 Over identifiable by its Head
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999318">
Unlike the prepositional uses of over that are likely to
be identified by the semantics of the Complements
alone, the following are the uses that would require the
semantic information of the Heads as well for identifica-
tion.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.441917">
2.2.1 Head denoting a physical event
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954927153846154">
When the Head of over denotes movement and the
Complement a place or a physical object, the over-
prepositional phrase indicates a place above which and
across which an object moves, as given below:
(7) a. The bullet goes flying over my head
and lands in the field behind me.
b. Safe, efficient movement over snow and
ice is impossible without suitable
crampons.
The prepositional phrase indicates a path over which an
object moves, and therefore it is termed over_path.
Another use of over indicating place is illustrated by
the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9494305">
(8) After spreading her napkin over her lap,
Alice began to eat.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891375">
The prepositional phrase implies a place on which or
above which an object sits. In this example, her napkin
is placed over her lap. This use is called over_locus. The
Head refers to an event denoted by a verb or noun be-
longing to the put verb class (cf. Levin [93]) while the
Complement a place or a physical object.
In addition, this use is also used with a Head verb
denoting the presence of an object as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.701455">
(9) An occasional loop stays over the needle
after knitting the row.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973374666666667">
Indeed, this use is more complex than it appears. In a
sentence with the BE verb, we find the following exam-
ples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.708507">
(10) a. My painting is over the sofa.
b. There were no taps over the sink.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994081903225806">
The use of over in this construction is tricky because it
is difficult to distinguish from the use of over meaning
about, as illustrated below:
(11) The disagreement here is over the substitutabil-
ity of assets.
As complex as such, this construction would need a
special syntactic treatment separately from other uses.
That is, in this construction, the subject noun phrase is
the Head of over, and thus the semantics of the subject
along with that of the Complement must be examined
for proper identification.
Another special syntactic treatment should be given
to an over-prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase
or noun, as in:
(12) I can just see the light over the door from
where Iâ€™m standing.
In this example, the Head is a noun phrase the light and
the Complement the door. Since the Head is a physical
object, and the Complement a physical object, the use of
over is over_locus, which means that the Head entity is
located at the Complement entity. When the Head in
this nominal modifier construction denotes an event or
state, as in his return flight over the North Sea, there
would be no special treatment required. It can be treated
in the same manner as when the verb is the Head.
A special pragmatic knowledge should come into
play in the use of over_locus. It is not straight-forward,
in fact, to determine this use only by the semantics of
the Head and Complement. In every construction for
this use, there is a possibility that the prepositional
phrase indicates the meaning of across, as illustrated in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7568475">
(13) a. His apartment is over my flat.
b. His apartment is over the river.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999301941176471">
Although both sentences have the same syntactic struc-
ture, they have noun phrases referring to different places.
As an apartment can be located over a flat in the real
world, the meaning of the prepositional phrase in (13a)
implies a place where an object is located (i.e.
over_locus). On the other hand, as an apartment is usu-
ally not located above the river, the meaning in (13b)
implies a place across where an object is situated. This
latter use of over is named over_across. To distinguish
between over_locus and over_across requires more than
the semantics of the Head and Complement components.
The distinction would require encyclopedic world
knowledge. Without having such a knowledge system,
this paper will treat both over_locus and over_across in
the same manner except for the fact that the default
choice between the two is over_locus due to the much
higher frequency in its use.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.844572">
2.2.2 Head denoting a nonphysical event
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999549666666667">
There are four uses of over whose Head denotes a non-
physical event. The use we examine at first is illustrated
in the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9955405">
(14) a. Marcos ruled over the Philippines for 20
years.
b. He has considerable control over her
activities.
c. He had one huge advantage over everyone
else.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804">
The Head denotes an act of control or having more
power. Among verbs of such a class are preside, rule,
win, excel, dominate and tower. This use metaphorically
implies that an object is above the other object in terms
of power.
The next use of over is found in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.682579">
(15) A general dictionary was preferred over
the domain-specific dictionaries.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980315566666667">
The Head is a verb or noun denoting selection. Among
them are prefer, choose, select, favor and the deverbal
nouns. This use is called over_prefer. The noun coun-
terpart of a verb in this class, however, should be treated
with care, because the over may imply the meaning of
about, as in
(16) They are organized to allow the users
choice over what to see, in the correct
time sequence.
What is going on is that over_prefer requires two enti-
ties in order to choose one over the other. When there
are no such two entities between which to choose, as in
(16), the meaning of over turns out to be that of about.
On the other hand, when there are, the meaning is
over_prefer, as illustrated in:
(17) One of the most basic freedoms anywhere
is the right to peace, and the choice of
quiet over noise.
Since verbs of this family are transitive verbs requiring
the Object, when the sentence contains both the Object
noun phrase and an over-prepositional phrase, the mean-
ing of over_prefer obtains. In the proposed decision tree
involving this use, the Head is limited to a verb, not a
noun because of this syntactic freedom of a noun in this
category. (To handle cases involving such a noun, a
question as to the number of the arguments governed by
the noun must be added.)
A final discussion is about two uses named
over_about and over_because. The use of over_because
is illustrated in the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9955305">
(18) a. Teachers were suspended over war posters.
b. He quit over a bribery scandal.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998595">
The over-prepositional phrase implies a cause of the
event or state. It seems that the meaning of
over_because requires a punctual event as in (18a) and
(18b). On the other hand, over with durational verbs in
this class gives rise to the meaning of over_about, as
illustrated by the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9811845">
(19) a. He talked over the issue for three hours.
b. Disputes over authorship are fiercely
fought.
c. There is growing concern over his illness.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969458846153846">
d. They thought over all the possible errors.
The Head of this use denotes events of communication
(such as hear and chat), agree events (such as disagree
and fight), psychological events or states (such as worry,
cry and agonize) and cognitive events or states (such as
think and know).
Table 3 shows the uses of over the meanings of
which are identified mainly by the semantics of the
Head.

3 Decision Trees for Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999096969697">
How do we distinguish computationally the meanings of
the prepositional uses of over listed in Tables 1 and 3?
Based on Tables 2 and 4, which are lists of the semantic
features in the Complements and Heads that are likely
to identify the meanings of over, two decision trees are
proposed. One is used to identify the meanings of over
from the semantic features of the Complements (Figure
1 in the Appendix), and the other, from the semantic
features of the Heads (Figure 2 in the Appendix). The
first search for the meaning of over should start with the
decision tree by its Complement (illustrated in Figure 1),
because most prepositional uses of over characterized
by the Complements denote time over event, and that
means that they are the modifiers of events (at the level
of verb phrases) rather than the modifiers of individual
verbs (located inside verb phrases). After failing in the
initial search at the decision tree by its Complement,
another search for the meaning of over should take
place at the decision tree by its Head in Figure 2.
The decision tree in Figure 1 asks whether the Com-
plement of over refers and/or contains such features as
listed in the diamonds, while in the decision tree in Fig-
ure 2, the question concerns the Head of over.
The Head component of over can be a verb govern-
ing the over-prepositional phrase (as in I would
PREFER coffee over tea), a verb phrase modified by the
over-prepositional phrase (as in A BIG EARTHQUAKE
OCCURED over the weekend) or a noun (as in He has
considerable CONTROL over her activities). In the BE
verb construction (such as The issue is over the election
of the chairman), the subject is the Head of over. The
Complement of over is a noun phrase governed by over
(as in over THE SPRING BREAK).

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999461375">
An evaluation of the two decision trees was conducted
manually by using 500 sentences containing over pro-
duced by the British National Corpus (BNC). Among
the 500 instances of over, there are 382 prepositional
uses. Among the remaining, fifty six (56) instances are
those meaning more than or excess, which are located
characteristically immediately before a quantity word or
phrase. Examples are given below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9058271">
(20) (a) We have visited over 90 schools
and reached 36,000 pupils.
(b) Anything over this amount is, basically
liable to inheritance tax at 40%.
Twenty (20) instances of over are adjectives meaning
completion, as in:
(21) My war seemed to be over.
Fifteen (15) instances are those used as adverb, an ex-
ample of which is illustrated:
(22) ... , and read the list over and over again.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971952791666667">
The sentences including over and over again are re-
peated twice in the data because of the two instances of
over in the phrase. The data contains six such sentences,
resulting in 12 counts of over and over again. Seven (7)
instances are used right before the to-prepositional
phrase or toward-prepositional phrase, as in:
(23) She went over to the Cookery and
Refreshments Tent, but ...
The distinction between such instances of over as in
(21), (22) and (23) on one hand and prepositional uses
on the other could be made by purely syntactic treat-
ments because of their different syntactic characteristics.
Most of instances meaning more than or excess as illus-
trated in (20) are morphologically distinguishable from
prepositional uses, because most of quantity nouns or
noun phrases after over refer to something other than
time. However, among the total 56 instances implying
more than or excess, thirteen (13) quantity phrases refer
to time. As such a phrase is composed of the same struc-
ture (over + noun/noun phrase) as an over-prepositional
phrase, this appears to cause difficulty. But a careful
examination of these constructions reveals otherwise.
Such a phrase of quantity occurs in a syntactic position
requiring a noun phrase, as illustrated in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992562428571429">
(24) a. ... after 12 years of living in those
conditions, I would probably want
to die myself.
b. ... I had heard nothing about my
family for over ten years.
c. ... since they were written over 10
years ago, ...
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9815927">
All these phrases of quantity are located either after a
preposition such as for, in, within and after or in an ad-
verbial phrase ending with such a word as ago and late.
Therefore, a good syntactic parser should be capable of
distinguishing these quantity phrases with over from
over-prepositional phrases.
Two instances of over are found in quoted phrases in
sentences. Eighteen (18) sentences are either incomplete
(as in PUB REFURBISHMENTS â€“ OVER THE LIMIT
and Over the wrenched?) or difficult to parse (as in
First part over, second part starts and ... moved hard
over in the direction of the spin).
With the non-prepositional uses and anomalous in-
stances of over in the data aside, the next topic of dis-
cussion is about the three hundred and eighty two (382)
prepositional uses found in the data. Among the 382,
eighty seven (87) instances of over are parts of phrasal
verbs or idiomatic phrases. Among the 87, fifty (50)
instances of over do NOT govern a prepositional phrase,
as illustrated below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8726045">
(25) a. And Dicky can take over as a footman.
b. She went over to fetch a cup of coffee.
c. I explain the position to the daughters
and hand Mum over to them.
d. ... there is no reason for their practiced
eyes to cloud over when ...
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999737816666667">
Thirty seven (37) instances of over are parts of phrasal
verbs governing an over-prepositional phrase. Examples
are given below:
(26) a. Go over the launch failure procedures
after any long lay-off from flying.
b. ... and failed promptly to hand over
detainees to the police - ...
With the lexicon containing sufficient information
on such phrasal verbs, there would remain two hundred
and ninety five (295) prepositional uses of over, the
meanings of which must be distinguished. The decision
trees proposed in this paper succeeded in determining
the meanings of two hundred and seventy six (276) in-
stances, and failed to interpret the meanings of nineteen
(19), resulting in a precision of 93.5 percent. However,
if the system does not recognize phrasal verbs, the value
of the precision will be lower.
Some more problems and possible solutions are dis-
cussed here. It would be difficult to determine the use of
over when the verbs in the sentence are conjoined, as in
We finished our coffee and watched the seagulls whirl-
ing and shrieking over the harbour in the spring sun-
shine. When the verb shriek is categorized as a
psychological verb, the use of over will be interpreted as
over_about, which is a wrong interpretation in this case.
The decision tree in Figure 1 will fail to recognize
the following example because a search for the use of
over_means requires the semantic feature +definite: ...
the cruel, brutal voices that bellow over loudhailers
about injustice .... The Complement of over, loud-
hailers is not preceded by the definite article the, which
is a requirement for identifying over_means. The feature
+definite may be dispensable for sense identification,
but it will be needed when the decision tree is used for
generation, because the definite article often occurs in
this type of prepositional phrase as in over the phone.
A difficulty in determining whether a noun refers to
a physical object or an abstract entity causes a problem.
The example ... with the lying motto over its gate ... is
hard to analyze. The use in this example is not
over_about, but over_locus. With the correct interpreta-
tion of motto either as a physical object or a statement,
the decision tree could lead to the right meaning of over.
If motto refers to a physical object, the use of over is
over_locus, whereas if it is not, the use is over_about.
In the example such as The drag of the cable over
one wing can make ..., the deverbal noun drag must be
properly parsed as the Head of over in order to interpret
the meaning of over correctly.
Based on the assumption (a) that a syntactic parsing
is successful, (b) that the over in phrasal verbs are rec-
ognized beforehand, and (c) that verbs and nouns are
properly categorized into classes, the two decision trees
could identify the meanings of most prepositional uses
of over in the corpus. In addition, information on
whether the Head event refers to a durational event or
not would enable the tree to distinguish between
over_about and over_because. Table 5 gives a break-
down of the instances of over found in the data (PP
stands for prepositional phrase):

<bodyText confidence="0.999970642857143">
After examining the meanings, the prepositional uses of
over have been divided into two groups: those whose
meanings are identifiable by their Complements and
those by their Heads. Previous studies have focused on
the identification of the meanings of over, whereas the
present paper not only on the meanings, but on the con-
texts for interpreting the meanings.
Two decision trees have been proposed for determin-
ing the meanings of the prepositional uses of over by
using the semantic features of the Head and Comple-
ment components. The decision trees are fairly simple
and easy to implement in a system. The decision trees
have been successful in identifying the meanings of the
prepositional uses of over in data taken from BNC.

It first examines the meanings of the uses of then aims at identifying the contexts for interpreting the meanings. Some contexts are complementary features, and that makes the decision trees simple. The trees have been tested on a corpus, and the results are encouraging.</abstract>
