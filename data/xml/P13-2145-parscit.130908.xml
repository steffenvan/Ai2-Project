We present a system for extracting the
dates of illness events (year and month of
the event occurrence) from posting histo-
ries in the context of an online medical
support community. A temporal tagger re-
trieves and normalizes dates mentioned in-
formally in social media to actual month
and year referents. Building on this, an
event date extraction system learns to in-
tegrate the likelihood of candidate dates
extracted from time-rich sentences with
temporal constraints extracted from event-
related sentences. Our integrated model
achieves 89.7% of the maximum perfor-
mance given the performance of the tem-
poral expression retrieval step.

<bodyText confidence="0.98095448">
In this paper we present a challenging new event
date extraction task. Our technical contribution
is a temporal tagger that outperforms previously
published baseline approaches in its ability to
identify informal temporal expressions (TE) and
that normalizes each of them to an actual month
and year (Chang and Manning, 2012; Strotgen
and Gertz, 2010). This temporal tagger then con-
tributes towards high performance at matching
event mentions with the month and year in which
they occurred based on the complete posting his-
tory of users. It does so with high accuracy on
informal event mentions in social media by learn-
ing to integrate the likelihood of multiple candi-
date dates extracted from event mentions in time-
rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted
from event-related sentences.
Despite considerable prior work in temporal in-
formation extraction, to date state-of-the-art re-
sources are designed for extracting temporally
scoped facts about public figures/organizations

al., 2012). When people are instead communi-
cating informally about their lives, they refer to
time more informally and frequently from their
personal frame of reference rather than from an
impersonal third person frame of reference. For
example, they may use their own birthday as a
time reference. The proportion of relative (e.g.,
“last week”, “two days from now”), or personal
time references in our data is more than one and a
half times as high as in newswire and Wikipedia.
Therefore, it is not surprising that there would be
difficulty in applying a temporal tagger designed
for newswire to social media data (Strotgen and
Gertz, 2012; Kolomiyets et al., 2011). Recent be-
havioral studies (Choudhury et al., 2013; Park and
Choi, 2012; Wen et al., 2012) demonstrate that
user-focused event mentions extracted from social
media data can provide a useful timeline-like tool
for studying how behavior patterns change over
time in response to mentioned events. Our re-
search contributes towards automating this work.

a candidate event and a posting history. The
output is the event date (month and year) for
the event if it occurred, or “unknown” if it
did not occur. The process iterates through a
list of 10 cancer events (CEs). This list in-
cludes breast cancer Diagnosis, Metastasis, Re-
currence, Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, Reconstruc-
tion, Chemotherapy-Start, Chemotherapy-End,
Radiation-Start and Radiation-End. For each of
these target CEs, we manually designed an event
keyword set that includes the name of the event,
abbreviations, slang, aliases and related words.
For each of the 10 events, all sentences that
mention a related event keyword are extracted
from the user’s posting history. Figure 1 shows
sevaral sentences that were extracted for one user
for the start date of Radiation. The task is to de-
termine that the beginning of this user’s Radiation
therapy was 2/2009. Note that the user began to
post about Radiation before she started it. She first
reported planning to start Radiation in March, but
then rescheduled for February. Most of the TEs
are non-standard and need to be resolved to calen-
dar dates (year and month).
Once the full set of event mention sentences has
been extracted for a user, all the temporal expres-
sions (TEs) that appear in the same sentence with
an event mention are resolved to a set of candi-
date dates. Besides a standard event-time classi-
fier for within-sentence event-time anchoring, we
leverage a new source of temporal information to
train a constraint-based event-time classifier. Pre-
vious work only retrieves time-rich sentences that
include both the query and some TEs (Ji et al.,
2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et
al., 2012). However, sentences that contain only
the event mention but no explicit TE can also be
informative. For example, the post time (usually
referred to as document creation time or DCT) of
the sentence “metastasis was found in my bone”
might be labeled as being after the “metastasis”
event date. These DCTs impose constraints on
the possible event dates, which can be integrated
with the event-time classifier, as a variant on re-
lated work(Chambers, 2012).

Previous work on TE extraction has focused
mainly on newswire text (Strotgen and Gertz,
2010; Chang and Manning, 2012). This paper
presents a rule-based TE extractor that identifies
and resolves a higher percentage of nonstandard
TEs than earlier state-of-art temporal taggers.
Our task is closest to the temporal slot filling
track in the TAC-KBP 2011 shared task (Ji et al.,
2011) and timelining task (McClosky and Man-
ning, 2012). Their goal was to extract the tempo-
ral bounds of event relations. Our task has two key
differences. First, they used newswire, Wikipedia
and blogs as data sources from which they extract
temporal bounds of facts found in Wikipedia in-
foboxes. Second, in the KBP task, the set of gold
event relations are provided as input, so that the
task is only to identify a date for an event that is
guaranteed to have been mentioned. In our task,
we provide a set of potential events. However,
most of the candidate events won’t have ever been
reported within a user’s posting history.
Temporal constraints have proven to be use-
ful for producing a globally consistent timeline.
In most temporal relation bound extraction sys-
tems, the constraints are included as input rather
than learned by the system (Talukdar et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2011). A notable exception is Mc-
Closkyet al. (2012) who developed an approach to
learning constraints such as that people cannot at-
tend school if they have not been born yet. A no-
table characteristic of our task is that constraints
are softer. Diseases may occur in very different
ways across patients. Recurring illnesses falsely
appear to have an unpredictable order. Thus, there
can be no universal logical constraints on the order
of cancer events.
Our approach to using temporal constraints is a
variant on previously published approaches. Gar-
rido et al. (2012) made use of DCT (document cre-
ation time) as well, however, they have assumed
the DCT is within the time-range of the event
stated in the document, which is often not true
in our data. Chambers (2012) utilized the within-
sentence time-DCT relation to learn constrains for
predicting DCT. We learn the event-DCT relations
to produce constrains for the event date.

We have scraped the posts, users, and profiles from
a large online cancer support community. From
this collection we extracted and then annotated
two separate corpora, one for evaluating our TE
retrieval and normalization, the other one for event
date extraction.
For creating the TE extraction corpus, we ran-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999959714285715">
domly picked one post from each of 1,000 ran-
domly selected users. We used this sampling tech-
nique because each user tends to use a narrow
range of date expression forms. From these posts,
we manually extracted 601 TEs and resolved them
to a specific month and year or just year if the
month was not mentioned. Events not reported
to have occurred were annotated as “unknown”.
Our corpus for event date extraction consists of
the complete posting history of 300 users that were
randomly drawn from our dataset. Three annota-
tors were provided with guidelines for how to in-
fer the date of the events (Wen et al., 2013). We
achieved .94 Kappa on identification of whether an
event has a reported event date in a user’s history
or not. In evaluation of agreement on extracted
dates, we achieved a .99 Cronbach’s alpha. From
this corpus, 509 events were annotated with occur-
rence dates (year and month). In our evaluation,
we use data from 250 users for training, and 50 for
testing.

<bodyText confidence="0.999945722222222">
Now we explain on a more technical level how our
system works on our task. Given an event and a
user’s post history, the system searches for all of
the sentences that contain an event keyword (key-
word sentence) and all the sentences that contain
both a keyword and a TE (date sentence). The TEs
in the date sentences are resolved and then used as
candidate dates for the event. For selecting among
candidate dates, our model integrates two main
components. First, the Date Classifier is trained
from date sentences to predict how likely its can-
didate TE and the gold event date are to overlap.
Then, because constraints over event dates can be
informed by temporal relations between the event
date and the DCT, the Constraint-based Classifier
provides an indication of the plausibility of can-
didate dates. The integrated system combines the
predictions from both classifiers.

We design a rule-based temporal tagger that is
built using regular expression patterns to recog-
nize informal TEs. Similar to SUTime (Chang and
Manning, 2012), we identify and resolve a wide
range of non-standard TE types such as “Feb ’07
(2/2007)”. The additional types of TE we han-
dle include: 1)user-specific TEs: A user’s age,
cancer anniversary and survivorship can provide
temporal information about the user’s CEs. We
obtain the birth date of users from their personal
profile to resolve age date expressions such as “at
the age of 57”. 2)non-whole numbers such as “a
year and half” and “1/2 weeks”. 3)abbreviations
of time units : e.g. “wk” as the abbreviation of
“week”. 4)underspecified month mentions, we
resolve the year information according to the DCT
month, the mentioned month and the verb tense.

5.2 Date Classifier
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999676205882353">
We train a MaxEnt classifier to predict the tem-
poral relationship between the retrieved TE and
the event date as overlap or no-overlap, similar
to the within-sentence event-time anchoring task
in TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). Fea-
tures for the classifier include many of those in
(McClosky and Manning, 2012; Yoshikawa et al.,
2009): namely, event keyword and its dominant
verb, verb and preposition that dominate TE, de-
pendency path between TE and keyword and its
length, unigram and bigram word and POS fea-
tures. New features include the Event-Subject,
Negative and Modality features. In online sup-
port groups, users not only tell stories about them-
selves, they also share other patients’ stories (as
shown in Figure 1). So we add subject fea-
tures to remove this kind of noise, which in-
cludes the governing subject of the event key-
word and its POS tag. Modality features include
the appearance of modals before the event key-
word (e.g., may, might). Negative features include
the presence/absence of negative words (e.g., no,
never). These two features indicate a hypothetical
or counter-factual expression of the event.
To calculate the likelihood of a candidate date
for an event, we need to aggregate the hard de-
cisions from the classifier. Let DSu be the set
of the user’s date sentences, let Du be the set of
dates resolved from each TE. We represent a Max-
Ent classifier by Prelation(R|t, ds) for a candidate
date t in date sentence ds and possible relation
R = {overlap, no-overlap}. We map the distri-
bution over relations to a distribution over dates
by defining PDateSentence(t|DSu):

Previous work only retrieves time-rich sentences
(i.e., date sentences) (Ling and Weld, 2010; Ji et
al., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido
et al., 2012). However, keyword sentences can in-
form temporal constraints for events and therefore
should not be ignored. For example, “Well, I’m
officially a Radiation grad!” indicates the user has
done radiation by the time of the post (DCT). “Ra-
diation is not a choice for me.” indicates the user
probably never had radiation. The topic of the
sentence can also indicate the temporal relation.
For example, before chemotherapy, the users tend
to talk about choices of drug combinations. After
chemotherapy, they talk about side-effects.
This section departs from the above Date Clas-
sifier and instead predicts whether each keyword
sentence is posted before or overlap-or-after the
user’s event date. The goal is to automatically
learn time constraints for the event. This task is
similar to the sentence event-DCT ordering task
in TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). We
create training examples by computing the tempo-
ral relation between the DCT and the user’s gold
event date. If the user has not reported an event
date, the label should be unknown.
We train a MaxEnt classifier on each event
mention paired with its corresponding DCT. All
the features used in the classifier component that
are not related to the TEs are included. Let
KSu be the set of the user’s keyword sentences,
let Du be the set of dates resolved from each
date sentence. We define a MaxEnt classifier by
Prelation(R|ks) for a keyword sentence ks and
possible relation R = {before, overlap-or-after,
unknown}. DCT is the post time of the keyword
sentence ks. The rel(DCT, t) function simply de-
termines if the DCT is before or overlap-or-after
the candidate date t. We map this distribution over
relations to a distribution over dates by defining

In previous work (McClosky and Manning, 2012;
Ji et al., 2011), the evaluation metric score is de-
fined as 1/((1 + |d|)) where d is the difference

line1, is to pick the date with the highest clas-
sifier’s prediction confidence. The second base-
line, Baseline2, is along the same lines as the
Combined Classifier used in (McClosky and Man-
ning, 2012). For example, if the candidate
date is “6/2009” and we have retrieved two TEs
that are resolved to “6/2009” and “4/2008”, then
P(“6/2009”) = Prelation(overlap|“6/2009”) ×
Prelation(no-overlap|“4/2008”).
To set an upper bound on performance given our
TE retrieval system, we calculate the oracle score
by considering an extraction as correct if the gold
date is one of the retrieved candidate dates. The
oracle score can differ from a perfect score since
we can only use candidate temporal expressions
if (a)the relation is known and (b)mentions of the
event are retrievable, (c)the TE and event keyword
appear in the same sentence, and (d)our temporal
tagger is able to recognize and resolve it correctly.

Table 3 shows the performance of our systems

Model derives most of its improvement from per-
formance related to the Chemotherapy/Radiation-

and Radiation last for a period of time and there
are more event-related discussions containing the
event keyword. None of our systems improves on
cancer Metastasis and Recurrence. This is likely
due to the sparsity of these events.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988461538462">
We presented a novel event date extraction task
that requires extraction and resolution of non-
standard TEs, namely personal illness event dates,
from the posting histories of online community
participants. We constructed an evaluation corpus
and designed a temporal tagger for non-standard
TEs in social media. Using a much stricter stan-
dard correctness measure than in previous work,
our method achieves promising results that are sig-
nificantly better than two types of baseline. By
creating an analogous keyword set, our event date
extraction method could be easily adapted to other
datasets.

A temporal tagger retrieves and normalizes dates mentioned informally in social media to actual month and year referents. Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from eventrelated sentences.

Chambers (2012) utilized the withinsentence time-DCT relation to learn constrains for predicting DCT. We learn the event-DCT relations to produce constrains for the event date. 4 Corpus Annotation We have scraped the posts, users, and profiles from a large online cancer support community.

Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step. 1 Introduction In this paper we present a challenging new event date extraction task. Our technical contribution is a temporal tagger that outperforms previously published baseline approaches in its ability to identify informal temporal expressions (TE) and that normalizes each of them to an actual month and year (Chang and Manning, 2012; Strotgen and Gertz, 2010). This temporal tagger then contributes towards high performance at matching event mentions with the month and year in which they occurred based on the complete posting history of users. It does so with high accuracy on informal event mentions in social media by learning to integrate the likelihood of multiple candidate dates extracted from event mentions in timerich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from event-related sentences.

First, the Date Classifier is trained from date sentences to predict how likely its candidate TE and the gold event date are to overlap. Then, because constraints over event dates can be informed by temporal relations between the event date and the DCT, the Constraint-based Classifier provides an indication of the plausibility of candidate dates. The integrated system combines the predictions from both classifiers. 5.1 Temporal Tagger We design a rule-based temporal tagger that is built using regular expression patterns to recognize informal TEs. Similar to SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), we identify and resolve a wide range of non-standard TE types such as “Feb ’07 (2/2007)”. The additional types of TE we handle include: 1)user-specific TEs: A user’s age, cancer anniversary and survivorship can provide temporal information about the user’s CEs. We obtain the birth date of users from their personal profile to resolve age date expressions such as “at the age of 57”. 2)non-whole numbers such as “a year and half” and “1/2 weeks”. 3)abbreviations of time units : e.g. “wk” as the abbreviation of “week”. 4)underspecified month mentions, we resolve the year information according to </context>
<context position="16117" citStr="Chang and Manning, 2012" startWordPosition="2632" endWordPosition="2635">el Given the Date Classifier of Section 5.2 and the Constraint-based Classifier of Section 5.3, we create a Integrated Model combining the two with the following linear interpolation as follows: P(t|postsu) = APDateSentence(t|DSu) + (1 − A)PKeywordSentence(t|KSu) where t is a candidate event date. The system will output t that maximizes P(t|postsu) and unknown if DSu is empty. A was set to 0.7 by maximizing accuracy using five-fold cross-validation over the training set. 6 Evaluation Metric and Results 6.1 Temporal Expression Retrieval We compare our temporal tagger’s performance with SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) on the 601 manually extracted TEs. We exclude userspecific TEs such as birthday references since SUTime cannot handle those. We first evaluate identification of the extent of a TE and then production of the correctly resolved date for each recognized expression.

Most of the TEs are non-standard and need to be resolved to calendar dates (year and month). Once the full set of event mention sentences has been extracted for a user, all the temporal expressions (TEs) that appear in the same sentence with an event mention are resolved to a set of candidate dates. Besides a standard event-time classifier for within-sentence event-time anchoring, we leverage a new source of temporal information to train a constraint-based event-time classifier. Previous work only retrieves time-rich sentences that include both the query and some TEs (Ji et al., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et al., 2012). However, sentences that contain only the event mention but no explicit TE can also be informative. For example, the post time (usually referred to as document creation time or DCT) of the sentence “metastasis was found in my bone” might be labeled as being after the “metastasis” event date. These DCTs impose constraints on the possible event dates, which can be integrated with the event-time classifier, as a variant on related work(Chambers, 2012). 3 Related Work Previous work on TE extraction has focused mainly on newswire text (Strotgen and Gertz, 2010; Chang and Man</context>

Features for the classifier include many of those in (McClosky and Manning, 2012; Yoshikawa et al., 2009): namely, event keyword and its dominant verb, verb and preposition that dominate TE, dependency path between TE and keyword and its length, unigram and bigram word and POS features. New features include the Event-Subject, Negative and Modality features. In online support groups, users not only tell stories about themselves, they also share other patients’ stories (as shown in Figure 1). So we add subject features to remove this kind of noise, which includes the governing subject of the event keyword and its POS tag. Modality features include the appearance of modals b</context>

For less than 4% of users, we have multiple dates for the same event (e.g., a user had a mastectomy twice). Similar to the evaluation metric in a previous study(Ji et al., 2011), in these cases, we give the system the benefit of the doubt and the extracted date is considered correct if it matches one of the gold dates. In previous work (McClosky and Manning, 2012; Ji et al., 2011), the evaluation metric score is defined as 1/((1 + |d|)) where d is the difference between the values in years.

The first baseline, Baseline1, is to pick the date with the highest classifier’s prediction confidence. The second baseline, Baseline2, is along the same lines as the Combined Classifier used in (McClosky and Manning, 2012). For example, if the candidate date is “6/2009” and we have retrieved two TEs that are resolved to “6/2009” and “4/2008”, then P(“6/2009”) = Prelation(overlap|“6/2009”) × Prelation(no-overlap|“4/2008”). To set an upper bound on performance given our TE retrieval system, we calculate the oracle score by considering an extraction as correct if the gold date is one of the retrieved candidate dates. The oracle score can differ from a perfect score since we can only use candidate temporal expressions if (a)the relation is known and (b)mentions of the event are retrievable, (c)the TE and event keyw</context>

Our technical contribution is a temporal tagger that outperforms previously published baseline approaches in its ability to identify informal temporal expressions (TE) and that normalizes each of them to an actual month and year (Chang and Manning, 2012; Strotgen and Gertz, 2010). This temporal tagger then contributes towards high performance at matching event mentions with the month and year in which they occurred based on the complete posting history of users. It does so with high accuracy on informal event mentions in social media by learning to integrate the likelihood of multiple candidate dates extracted from event mentions in timerich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from event-related sentences.

Second, in the KBP task, the set of gold event relations are provided as input, so that the task is only to identify a date for an event that is guaranteed to have been mentioned. In our task, we provide a set of potential events. However, most of the candidate events won’t have ever been reported within a user’s posting history. Temporal constraints have proven to be useful for producing a globally consistent timeline. In most temporal relation bound extraction systems, the constraints are included as input rather than learned by the system (Talukdar et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). A notable exception is McCloskyet al. (2012) who developed an approach to learning constraints such as that people cannot attend school if they have not been born yet. A notable characteristic of our task is that constraints are softer. Diseases may occur in very different ways across patients. Recurring illnesses falsely appear to have an unpredictable order. Thus, there can be no universal logical constraints on the order of cancer events. Our approach to using temporal constraints is a variant on previously published approaches. Garrido et al.

After chemotherapy, they talk about side-effects. This section departs from the above Date Classifier and instead predicts whether each keyword sentence is posted before or overlap-or-after the user’s event date. The goal is to automatically learn time constraints for the event. This task is similar to the sentence event-DCT ordering task in TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). We create training examples by computing the temporal relation between the DCT and the user’s gold event date. If the user has not reported an event date, the label should be unknown. We train a MaxEnt classifier on each event mention paired with its corresponding DCT. All the features used in the classifier component that are not related to the TEs are included. Let KSu be the set of the user’s keyword sentences, let Du be the set of dates resolved from each date sentence. We define a MaxEnt classifier by Prelation(R|ks) for a keyword sentence ks and possible relation R = {before, overlap-o</context>

Second, in the KBP task, the set of gold event relations are provided as input, so that the task is only to identify a date for an event that is guaranteed to have been mentioned. In our task, we provide a set of potential events. However, most of the candidate events won’t have ever been reported within a user’s posting history. Temporal constraints have proven to be useful for producing a globally consistent timeline. In most temporal relation bound extraction systems, the constraints are included as input rather than learned by the system (Talukdar et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). A notable exception is McCloskyet al. (2012) who developed an approach to learning constraints such as that people cannot attend school if they have not been born yet. A notable characteristic of our task is that constraints are softer. Diseases may occur in very different ways across patients. Recurring illnesses falsely appear to have an unpredictable order. Thus, there can be no universal logical constraints on the order of cancer events. Our approach to using temporal constraints is a variant on previously published approaches. Garrido et al. (2012) made use of DCT (document creation tim</context>

For example, they may use their own birthday as a time reference. The proportion of relative (e.g., “last week”, “two days from now”), or personal time references in our data is more than one and a half times as high as in newswire and Wikipedia. Therefore, it is not surprising that there would be difficulty in applying a temporal tagger designed for newswire to social media data (Strotgen and Gertz, 2012; Kolomiyets et al., 2011). Recent behavioral studies (Choudhury et al., 2013; Park and Choi, 2012; Wen et al., 2012) demonstrate that user-focused event mentions extracted from social media data can provide a useful timeline-like tool for studying how behavior patterns change over time in response to mentioned events. Our research contributes towards automating this work. 2 Task Our task is to extract personal illness events mentioned in the posting histories of online community participants.

Features for the classifier include many of those in (McClosky and Manning, 2012; Yoshikawa et al., 2009): namely, event keyword and its dominant verb, verb and preposition that dominate TE, dependency path between TE and keyword and its length, unigram and bigram word and POS features. New features include the Event-Subject, Negative and Modality features. In online support groups, users not only tell stories about themselves, they also share other patients’ stories (as shown in Figure 1). So we add subject features to remove this kind of noise, which includes the governing subject of the event keyword and its POS tag. Modality features include the appearance of modals before the event keyword (</context>
