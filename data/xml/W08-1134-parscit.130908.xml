1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999396875">
The NIL entry for the challenge has been con-
structed upon the general architecture for develop-
ing Natural Language Generation systems provided
by the TAP project (Gervas, 2007). TAP (Text Ar-
ranging Pipeline) is a set of interfaces that define
generic functionality for a pipeline of tasks oriented
toward natural language generation, from an initial
conceptual input to surface realization as a string,
with intervening stages of content planning and sen-
tence planning.
The TAP architecture considers three basic stages:
content planning, sentence planning and surface re-
alization. Of these, the first stage is not relevant to
the challenge tasks. The configuration choices ap-
plied to the other two stages to adapt them to the
challenge tasks are described below.

2 NIL-UCM-MFVF Entry for Task 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997">
The NIL-UCM-MFVF for Task 1 applies a Most-
Frequent-Value-First method for Attribute Selec-
tion. Of the five evaluation dimensions considered
in this challenge (Dice, MASI, accuracy, minimal-
ity and uniqueness), this method has been designed
to address explicitly only three: Dice, MASI and
uniqueness. Minimality was abandoned in view of
results in previous challenges (Hervas and Gervas,
2007) that showed good minimality results tended to
produce low Dice scores. We have also opted for not
using accuracy evaluation to fit the performance of
our system, since the corpus contains a wide range
of style of reference and we are interested in pro-
viding our system with only a subset of these that
ensure correct identification.

2.1 Most-Frequent-Value-First Attribute
Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983610291666667">
The selection algorithm employed is an adapta-
tion of the algorithm described in (Reiter and Dale,
1992). The original algorithm has been modified to
allow for a dynamically changing list of preferred
attributes, which determine the particular order in
which attributes are considered to generate the dis-
tinguishing expression. This list is constructed dy-
namically for each reference by computing the prob-
ability of occurrence in the corpus of the particu-
lar attribute-value pairs associated with the referent,
and using those probabilities to rank them into a spe-
cific list of preferred attributes. The idea is that at-
tributes should be considered in a particular order
depending highly on their values. For example, in
the people domain we have observed that almost
the 100% of the target entities that have beard (at-
tribute has value 1) are referred using the attribute
hasBeard, but when this attribute has value 0 it is
never used. For the hasHair attribute, the opposite
seems to be the case (mentioned only when lacking).
The training data was studied to obtain the prob-
ability of occurrence of an attribute given a certain
value for it. This probability was calculated using
Formula 1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999466">
E appsV alueInAttSet
probvali = E appsV alueInTarget (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999304125">
For each possible value of each of the attributes
of the domains, the sum of the appearances of this
value in the ATTRIBUTE-SET elements (appsVal-
ueInAttSet) and the sum of the appearances of this
value in the attributes of all targets (appsValueInTar-
get) are calculated. The division of these two values
is the probability of mentioning an attribute when it
has a specific value.

Some examples of the results obtained are that the
attribute hasGlasses is mentioned in the 60% of
the situations when its value is 1, and in the 0% of
the situations when its value is 0. On the contrary,
the attribute hasShirt is almost never mentioned
(0.8% when its value is 1 and 0% with value 0).
The only exception in the algorithm is the type
attribute for the people domain. As every entity in
this domain is of type person, the attribute selector
does not choose this attribute because no distractor
is discarded by it. However, the experiments have
shown us that in the corpus a lot of descriptions in-
clude the type person even when it is redundant.
Following this idea, our algorithm always includes
the type in the list of chosen attributes for the peo-
ple domain.1

paring both tables there are no surprises in the final
results: the system gets similar results with both do-
mains and with both the training and development

appearance of an attribute depending on its value is
more or less the same in the whole corpus.

The NIL-UCM-BSC for Task 2 applies a Best-
Scoring-Choice approach to Realization.

ence between NIL-UCM results for the people and the furniture

is noticeable only when the type attribute is redundant, as it is

pression Generation, Syntactic Choice, and Lexical-
ization stages of the Sentence Planning module of
TAP, and it draws on the SurReal (Gervis, 2006) sur-
face realization module. SurReal provides a Java im-
plementation of the surface realization mechanisms
of FUF described in Elhadad (Elhadad, 1993), op-
erating over a grammar which follows the notational
conventions of the SURGE grammar in Elhadad (El-
hadad and Robin, 1996), but it is not systemic in na-
ture. It currently has much smaller coverage than the
original, but quite sufficient to deal with the kind of
realizations required for the challenge tasks.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99926">
3.1 Realization Choices in the Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984416666667">
An analysis of the domain was carried out to ascer-
tain what the various alternatives required for real-
ization were for the given corpus, both in terms of
how to realize syntactically the different concepts
and what alternative lexicalizations should be con-
sidered. With respect to linguistic variation in the
form of expression we have distinguished between
choices that give rise to different syntactic struc-
tures (which we consider as syntactic choices) and
choices which give rise to the same syntactic struc-
tures but with different lexical items (which we con-
sider as lexical choices).
With respect to the Referring Expression Genera-
tion stage, the following issues required specific de-
cisions. The use of determiners is erratic. Some
examples in the corpus use indefinite article, some
use definite articles, and some omit the determin-
ers altogether. The corpus shows many cases where
spatial expressions describing the location of refer-
ents are used, many using different systems of refer-
ence (north-south vs. top-bottom). The use of par-
ticular features of the object in its description, as
in “the desk with the drawers facing the viewer” or
“the chair with the seat facing away”. Comparison

with all or some of the distractors are also used, ei-
ther as adjuncts describing their position relative to
other distractors, as in “the blue fan next to the green
fan”, or as comparative adjectives used for particu-
lar attributes, as in “the largest red couch” (and even
combinations of the two as in “the smaller of the two
blue fans”). Finally, there are samples in the corpus
of use of ellipsis and ungrammatical expressions.
The mention of particular features and the use of
comparison would involve operating on more data
than are generated in task 1, and the current sub-
mission is aimed to interconnection with task 2 for
addressing task 3. The issue of ungrammaticality is
important since it implies that there is an upper limit
to the possible scores that the system may achieve
over the corpus under the circumstances, totally un-
related with the correctness of the generated expres-
sions.
With respect to Syntactic Choice, some attributes
show more than one possible option for syntac-
tic realization. The number of alternatives varies
from color (“grey chair - chair that is gray”), through
beards (“with beard - with the beard - with whiskers
- the bearded man - with a beard - with facial hair”)
to orientation (12 different syntactic alternatives for
expressing orientation: back).
There are slight variations of Lexical Choice over
the corpus, as in “sofa - couch - settee - loveseat”,
“ventilator - fan - windmill” or “man - guy - bloke”
(for nouns) and “large - big” or “small - little” (for
adjectives). Because it has a significant impact on
the edit distance measure, it is also important to con-
sider the existence of a large number of misspellings
in the corpus. Finally, there are some conceptual
mismatches in annotation, between the attribute
set and the given realization in some cases (“purple
- blue”, “black and white - grey”,...).

3.2 Best Scoring Choice Solution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985428571429">
The solution employed in the present submission
for selecting among the features described above
implements straight forward realization rather than
choice, in the sense in which (Cahill, 1998) uses the
terms for lexicalization. To implement real choice
the system would have to consider more than one al-
ternative for a specific feature and to select one of
them based on some criteria. This has not been done
in the present submission. Instead, a single alterna-
tive has been implemented for each feature, using
it consistently across all samples. The selection of
which particular alternative to implement has been
done empirically to ensure the best possible score
over the training corpus.

An important point to consider with respect to
the current submission is whether a solution im-
plementing real choice would have obtained bet-
ter results. Such a solution might have benefited
from the information that can be extracted from the
ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING to train a decision
procedure on the various features. This has not been
addressed in the present submission more for lack of
time than lack of conviction on its merit.
Addressing explicitly some of the possible con-
structions that are described in section 3.1 may also
have a positive effect on the results.

The results obtained are a bit lower than the ones
obtained by both the attribute selection and realiza-
tion submodules separately. This is not an unex-
pected result. Bad choices produced in the attribute
selection are propagated through the realization, re-
sulting in accumulated errors in the final evaluation.
However, there are additional shortcomings that
arise from considering the general goal of task 3
as a composition of task 2 over task 1. The re-
duction of the types of expression produced by hu-
man subjects to a set of attributes involves in some
cases a certain loss of information. This is par-
ticularly the case when the human-produced ex-
pressions involve attributes for which additional in-
formation is provided. This can be seen if the
ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING is compared with
the actual attribute set generated for some of the
human-produced expressions. For instance, the cor-
pus contains examples in which the hasBeard at-
tribute has a nested attribute that indicates the beard
is white. Other examples provide color information
on pieces of clothing worn. This information is lost
to the realization stage if the data have to go through
task 1, which reduces the available format to a set of
individual unstructured attributes.
Considering a version of task 3 that allowed full
realization directly from input data as considered for
task 1, with no requirements on the stages of inter-
mediate representation to be employed in the pro-
cess, may result in a richer range of realizations, and
possibly in improved performance with respect to
human evaluation.
In more general terms, it seems that the corpus
does contain adequate data for informing system
performance at the level of sentence planning sub-
tasks such as lexical choice or syntactic choice. Nev-
ertheless, some of the variations in the corpus, such
as the free use of determiners or the flexibility that
subjects exhibit in the way they refer to the images
do introduce a certain “noise”. Instances of these oc-
cur when human-produced descriptions involve in-
tense forms of ellipsis, and agrammatical ordering
of attributes. Some of these might be reduced if a re-
fined version of the corpus were produced with more
control on the experimental settings, to ensure that
subjects either described the elements as images or
as the things represented in the images, for instance.

The original algorithm has been modified to allow for a dynamically changing list of preferred attributes, which determine the particular order in which attributes are considered to generate the distinguishing expression. This list is constructed dynamically for each reference by computing the probability of occurrence in the corpus of the particular attribute-value pairs associated with the referent, and using those probabilities to rank them into a specific list of preferred attributes. The idea is that attributes should be considered in a particular order depending highly on their values.</context>
