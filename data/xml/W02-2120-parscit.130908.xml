Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999930875">
Previous research has shown that certain
discourse conditions are necessary for the
felicitous use of non-canonical syntactic
forms like topicalization, left-dislocation,
and clefts. However, the distribution of
these forms does not correlate one-to-one
with the presence of these conditions, and
a system that generates these statistically-
rare forms based only on these condi-
tions will overgenerate. Instead, a genera-
tion algorithm must be based on additional
communicative goals that can be achieved
through the use of these forms. Based on a
corpus study, I present three types of com-
municative goals that speakers achieve
through the use of non-canonical syntax.

Users of natural languages have many ways to en-
code the same propositional content within a sin-
gle clause. In English, besides the “canonical”
word order, options include topicalization, (2), left-
dislocation, (3), it-clefts, (4), and wh-clefts, (5).

Corpus-based research has shown that these forms
are appropriate only under certain discourse con-
ditions (Prince, 1978); (Birner and Ward, 1998);
among others. These include the membership of
referents in a salient set of discourse entities (left-
dislocations and topicalizations), or the salience of
particular propositions within the discourse model
(topicalizations and clefts).
The discourse conditions posited in the litera-
ture that allow the felicitous use of these and other
non-canonical syntactic forms are necessary con-
ditions. When they do not hold, native speakers
judge the use of a non-canonical form infelicitous.
They are not, however, sufficient conditions for their
use (Vallduvi, 1990). Even when they hold, speak-
ers may choose the option of not using a special
form, or alternatively, the use of a special form
may still be judged as odd. Moreover, although the
use of these forms appears to be optional, in some
contexts, substitution of a canonical sentence for
the non-canonical yields a difficult-to-interpret dis-
course. We will illustrate each of these situations
below in Section 2.

1.2 Relevance for NLG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877142857143">
Even when considering only a single main clause,
there are usually many ways to encode propositional
content. The purpose of an NLG is not simply to
encode propositions as grammatical strings that oc-
cur with high frequency in a corpus, but rather to
encode them as both grammatical and contextually-
appropriate strings from which users can derive the
system’s communicative intent and update their own
knowledge store accordingly.
Previous NLG work on English clausal word or-
der variation has attempted to integrate contextual
information into the process of choosing a intra-
clausal word order (Stone et al., 2001); (Geldof,
2000); (Klabunde and Jansche, 1998); (Humphreys,
1995). However, this work for the most part has not
been grounded in corpus-based research on the dis-
course function of these forms. In addition, even
work based on sound pragmatic research (Stone et
al., 2001) cannot account for the pattern of usage de-
scribed here because the model of choosing a form
is too simple. Whenever the necessary conditions
hold, a special form is generated. Given how rare
non-canonical word order is, this model will result
in overgeneration1.
The purpose of this project is to study when hu-
man speakers generate different syntactic encodings
of propositions in order to better characterize their
conditions of use for utilization in an NLG system.

2 Patterns to be explained
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915444444445">
This section first presents the previously posited fac-
tors conditioning the use of non-canonical syntax.
Then, three patterns of use left unexplained by these
factors will be discussed.
Topicalization and left-dislocation both involve
an NP “displaced” to the left-periphery of the clause.
In topicalizations this NP is coreferential with a
gap/trace somewhere in the clause. In a left-
dislocation, it is coreferential with a pronoun within
the clause. As shown in (Birner and Ward, 1998),
topicalizations are felicitous when two conditions
hold: 1) the referent of the topicalized NP is a mem-
ber of a salient partially-ordered set (poset) and 2)
the open proposition expressed by the main clause,
constructed by replacing the constituent receiving
tonic stress by a variable, is salient to the hearer.
The corresponding conditions for the topicalization
in (6) are shown in (7).

Journal and Switchboard corpora, these four forms appear with
a frequency of about 200 and 850 tokens per million words, re-
spectively. In the corpus used for this project, 58 transcribed
oral histories from the online Social Security Administration
Oral History Archives (SSA), these forms occurred with a fre-
quency of 850 per 750,000 words.

Left-dislocations, in contrast, only require a single
condition for felicitous usage. Here the clause-initial

The discourse status of each varies by type of
cleft. In a wh-cleft, the information conveyed by
the presupposition must be material that (the speaker
can assume) is in the hearer’s consciousness at
the time of utterance, either discourse-old or infer-
able from something else presented in the discourse
(Prince, 1978). In an it-cleft, in contrast, the exis-
tential closure of the open proposition should be a
belief of the speaker (Dryer, 1996).

<bodyText confidence="0.969713833333333">
In some cases, when the discourse conditions hold
for the use of a non-canonical form, either a canon-
ical or non-canonical is acceptable with little or no
change in meaning. For example, in (12), the dis-
course conditions that permit topicalization hold.
There is a salient open proposition, ADMINISTRA-
TION FELT X ABOUT BALANCED BILLING LIMITS,
and balanced billing is a member of a salient set,
POLICIES THAT MIGHT BE ADOPTED. However, the
speaker chose not to use a topicalized sentence. In
contrast, in (13) the speaker uses a topicalized sen-
tence even though canonical order does not seem
different in this context.

2.2 Non-canonical odd when conditions hold

<bodyText confidence="0.999918">
In some contexts, the conditions licensing a non-
canonical appear to hold, but the use of such a form
would be odd. For example, (14) is an excerpt from
an oral history of a soldier’s experience in WWII.
The implicit question the text answers is What did
the speaker do then?. However, substituting a wh-
cleft for a canonical sentence into an arbitrary point
in the text is odd. In (15), the writer is replying
to a message about choosing a laptop on a news-
group about laptops. The writer can assume the
salience of the poset LAPTOPS and the open propo-
sition WRITER WOULD DO X. However, neither a
topicalization nor a left-dislocation is felicitous here,
as shown in (15a).

<bodyText confidence="0.8768274">
In some cases, the non-canonical form is not only
felicitous, but allows additional inferences. Using
a canonical form instead would result in a different
interpretation. For example, in (16), without the it-
cleft the hearer would conclude the speaker was un-
certain about whether the president was at the con-
ference. With the it-cleft, however, the uncertainty
can only be about the cause of the president’s ab-
sence because the remainder of the clause is marked
as presupposed. In (17), without the left-dislocation
one would infer that the meeting of the second guy
took place at the same time as the event in the previ-
ous clause.
(16) The conference was to take place in November. [...] We

3 Choosing intraclausal word order
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992818181818">
The previous section demonstrated that the distribu-
tion of non-canonical forms does not correlate one-
to-one with the presence of the necessary conditions
posited in the literature, and in some cases these op-
tional forms play a crucial role in the meaning con-
tributed by an utterance.
In this section we will outline a preliminary model
for characterizing these choices as an augmentation
of the SPUD system (Stone et al., 2001). Because
SPUD explicitly connects communicative goals and
the discourse context through patterns of linguistic
form it is well-suited as a basis for characterizing a
model of how to choose clause syntax.
By using non-canonical forms, speakers make ex-
plicit their assumptions about the discourse model,
including which entities are in poset relations and
which open propositions are currently salient or pre-
supposed. Making these assumptions explicit can
trigger further inferences (as shown in Section 2.3).
Therefore, an algorithm for syntactic choice must
incorporate goals characterized by when speakers
want to trigger these inferences.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998853">
3.1 Sentence Planning Using Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951628571429">
SPUD (Stone et al., 2001) is an NLG system that
combines sentence planning and surface realization
by choosing lexical items and their associated syn-
tactic and semantic representations simultaneously.
Any utterance generated by SPUD can be charac-
terized by its COMMUNICATIVE INTENT, the set of
inferences to which the speaker is committed to in
uttering a sentence and that they expect the hearer
to recover when interpreting the utterance. The
source of SPUD’s inferences are the conversational
record, the system’s beliefs, and the user’s beliefs.
SPUD’s knowledge base keeps track of information
to be asserted and the information status (discourse-
and hearer-oldness) and salience of discourse enti-
ties (entities, poset relations, and open propositions).
Currently, communicative intent is divided into three
records:
ASSERTIONS, the update to the conversational
record that the utterance is intended to achieve
PRESUPPOSITIONS, how particular elements in
the utterance link to individuals already present
in the conversational record
PRAGMATICS, requirements on the status of in-
dividuals in the discourse
In Stone, et al. (2001), only the assertions of an ut-
terance affect the conversational record. The choice
of main clause syntactic form is related only to the
pragmatics. For example, a transitive verb will be
associated with multiple trees; a tree with canonical
order can be chosen in any context. A tree with a
topicalized order will be associated with the prag-
matic requirements discussed in section 2 and will
be selected if they are fulfilled Any tree, canonical or
non-canonical, associated with the verb will achieve
the same update to the conversational record.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.84938">
3.2 Communicative goals of non-canonical
syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969666666667">
Based on the current corpus study, the update of the
conversational record that an utterance can achieve
should be modified. In particular, trees with non-
canonical syntax will be associated with not just the
assertions of their canonical counterpart and some
necessary pragmatic conditions but will also be as-
sociated with a richer set of potential assertions that
they achieve by virtue of the fact that they can be
used to fulfill some additional communicative goals.
In this section I present three additional types of
goals to be included in the system: attention mark-
ing, discourse relation, and focus disambiguation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925906">
3.2.1 Attentional goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946412138888889">
The attentional structure of a discourse can be
modeled as a stack of focus spaces that contains
the individuals salient at each point in a discourse
(Grosz and Sidner, 1986). Although the pragmatic
constraints on the use of non-canonical forms in
SPUD currently require certain entities (posets and
open propositions) to be salient, in fact the use of
the form is often better characterized as licensing
an inference that this entity is relevant at a par-
ticular point in the discourse. Speakers can use a
non-canonical form to efficiently indicate which dis-
course entities are currently relevant in order to have
the hearers’ model of the discourse match their own
more closely. For example, in (18), the topicaliza-
tion licenses the inference that the poset ASPECT
OF PRESS BEING DISCUSSED is relevant here; i.e.
the speaker is only making a statement about a sin-
gle member of the poset (i.e. press = ‘news stories’)
not any others.
(18) Q: Would you discuss your relations with the press and
its attitude toward Social Security over the years?
Altmeyer: I don’t know what you mean by the press. The
press, insofar as news stories are concerned, I don’t
think had much influence one way or another.(SSA)
As such, uttering a topicalization in this case
will fulfill both the goal COMMUNICATE( IN-
POSET( , )), where is the semantics of , and
is the topicalized referent in poset . As such it
seems that IN-POSET( ) need not be explicitly part
of the current attentional state of the conversational
record, as long as it is inferable from the conver-
sational record. In addition, SPUD will need to be
altered so that the form fulfilling the most specific
pragmatic requirements will not automatically be
chosen unless those conditions contribute to achiev-
ing a communicative goal.2
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.979075666666667">
2The oddness of (15a) can now be explained as a use of
a topicalization when achieving this additional communicative
goal is unnecessary. Given the context of the utterance, the
membership of a Toshiba in the set LAPTOPS is salient and as-
sumed; a cooperative speaker should not have a goal of commu-
nicating this information.
</footnote>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.672238">
3.2.2 Discourse relation goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991475">
In any text made up of more than a single utter-
ance, the semantic relations that hold between ut-
terances are an additional part of the meaning of
the text supplementing the meaning that a single
utterance contributes. These relations, referred to
as coherence, subject matter, or semantic relations
(Kehler, 2002; Hobbs, 1990; Halliday, 1985; Mann
and Thompson, 1988), hold between two utterances
and include, for example, the temporal relation hold-
ing between events or a contrast relation holding be-
tween the propositions. Because the linguistic mate-
rial comprising a text, its clauses and phrases, can be
combined into larger discourse segments, these rela-
tions may hold between sets of utterances. These
groupings of utterances (or the intentions underly-
ing them) are often modeled as a hierarchical tree
structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
Speakers can use non-canonical forms to commu-
nicate information about both coherence relations
and discourse segmentation, as illustrated above in
(17) and here in (19). In (17), the use of a left-
dislocation changes the time interpretation of the
event in the second sentence. The left-dislocation
instructs the hearer that the relation between this
clause and the previous is not NARRATIVE, but PAR-
ALLEL. The second clause is not a continuation of
the event described by the first, but a separate event.
In (19), the use of the it-cleft occurs after some inter-
vening discussion of a separate topic marked by the
hearer as an aside; it allows the speaker to mark his
question as related to previous discussion because it
marks the OP, YOU GOT TO MICHIGAN STATE AT
TIME T, as presupposed. In a tree structure of this
discourse, the cleft will correspond to an instruction
to “pop” back to a higher level in the tree when at-
taching the utterance.

3.2.3 Focus disambiguation goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.930670787234043">
In English, focus-ground structure correlates sig-
nificantly with the prosodic effects of duration and
amplitude (Hockey, 1998). The focus marks the
part of an utterance which would correspond to the
instantiation of the missing constituent in a wh-
question with that utterance as the answer (Gussen-
hoven, 1984). In other words, focus-ground par-
tition is relative to an implicit question being an-
swered (Kuppevelt, 1995).
Although speakers must prosodically mark focus-
ground structure on every utterance, this prosodic
focus marking is often ambiguous. A single sen-
tence final pitch accent may potentially correspond
to multiple focus structures (Ladd, 1996). In addi-
tion, depending on its heaviness, even a single con-
stituent may be realized with multiple pitch accents.
Whether these pitch accents necessarily correspond
to focus-ground partitioning is still a matter of de-
bate (Ladd, 1996; Steedman, 2000).
In contrast, the syntactic forms here can mark
focus-ground partitioning unambiguously and inde-
pendently of their prosody. For example, a wh-cleft
can disambiguate the focus-ground partitioning of
an utterance, as in (20). Here the focused object NP
can be realized with multiple prosodic phrases each
with its own primary accent; its canonical counter-
part would at the least be ambiguous with respect
to whether the object or the entire VP were in focus
(Ladd, 1996).
(20) There are those that would argue that what we need
is a quick and dirty decision at the state level based
upon whatever information that was to come in the
door...(SSA)
This goal will be the most difficult to sim-
ply append to the SPUD generation system.
The need to disambiguate the focus structure
of an utterance is conditioned not only by a
speaker’s goal COMMUNICATE( FOCUS-
PARTITION( , ( ))), where is the ground and
is the focus, but by the formal options and re-
quirements the speaker has when realizing this goal
3Because SPUD’s grammar is a Lexicalized TAG, a dis-
course structure component in SPUD could be implemented by
utilizing the tree structures of a Discourse LTAG (Webber et al.,
To appear). Part of creating a description of discourse entity
would then correspond to selecting a discourse tree to adjoin to
the preceding discourse structure.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749">
A speaker’s choice of forms is a complex piece of
discourse and sentence planning. Rather than a sim-
ple function from a discourse condition to a form,
it depends on the speaker’s intention to communi-
cate information about the status of entities in the
discourse model, to relate the meaning of one ut-
terance to another, and to disambiguate focus struc-
ture. The multiple intentions that a single utterance
can achieve when realized with non-canonical syn-
tax make syntactic choice a useful communicative
tool.
However, there remain several problems with
making it a practical tool for NLG systems:
Any simple implementation is likely to over-
generate.
Even given a set of goals that forms can
achieve, it is not clear when a system should
intend to achieve such goals.
Multiple means of achieving these goals be-
sides syntactic form are possible (e.g. use of
discourse connectives or prosody).
If multiple goals can be achieved with a single
form (e.g. discourse segmentation and focus-
ground partitioning), how will hearer’s know
how to update their discourse model?
In order to resolve these problems, the next step
in this project will be to annotate texts with the set
of above goals and apply a learning algorithm in or-
der to determine which, if any, aspects of context
and form correspond to ways—syntactic, prosodic,
and lexical—of achieving these goals. Although it
may seem a more general problem of AI planning
to determine when speakers have particular goals, in
the case of such “low level” linguistic goals, prior
linguistic context may be enough to motivate these
goals. A probabilistic model may be the most useful
characterization of the interaction between the mul-
tiple goals and the multiple methods of achieving
them in a particular context; I will test this claim
through training and testing a learning algorithm.

<abstract confidence="0.999661470588235">Previous research has shown that certain discourse conditions are necessary for the felicitous use of non-canonical syntactic forms like topicalization, left-dislocation, and clefts. However, the distribution of these forms does not correlate one-to-one with the presence of these conditions, and a system that generates these statisticallyrare forms based only on these conditions will overgenerate. Instead, a generation algorithm must be based on additional communicative goals that can be achieved through the use of these forms. Based on a corpus study, I present three types of communicative goals that speakers achieve through the use of non-canonical syntax.</abstract>

In this section I present three additional types of goals to be included in the system: attention marking, discourse relation, and focus disambiguation. 3.2.1 Attentional goals The attentional structure of a discourse can be modeled as a stack of focus spaces that contains the individuals salient at each point in a discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). Although the pragmatic constraints on the use of non-canonical forms in SPUD currently require certain entities (posets and open propositions) to be salient, in fact the use of the form is often better characterized as licensing an inference that this entity is relevant at a particular point in the discourse. Speakers can use a non-canonical form to efficiently indicate which discourse entities are currently relevant in order to have the hearers’ model of the discourse match their own more closely. For example, in (18), the topicalization licenses the inference that the poset ASPECT OF PRESS</context>

Because the linguistic material comprising a text, its clauses and phrases, can be combined into larger discourse segments, these relations may hold between sets of utterances. These groupings of utterances (or the intentions underlying them) are often modeled as a hierarchical tree structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). Speakers can use non-canonical forms to communicate information about both coherence relations and discourse segmentation, as illustrated above in (17) and here in (19). In (17), the use of a leftdislocation changes the time interpretation of the event in the second sentence. The left-dislocation instructs the hearer that the relation between this clause and the previous is not NARRATIVE, but PARALLEL. The second clause is not a continuation of the event described by the first, but a separate event. In (19), the use of the it-cleft occurs after some intervening discussion of a separate topic</context>

In this section we will outline a preliminary model for characterizing these choices as an augmentation of the SPUD system (Stone et al., 2001). Because SPUD explicitly connects communicative goals and the discourse context through patterns of linguistic form it is well-suited as a basis for characterizing a model of how to choose clause syntax. By using non-canonical forms, speakers make explicit their assumptions about the discourse model, including which entities are in poset relations and which open propositions are currently salient or presupposed. Making these assumptions explicit can trigger further inferences (as shown in Section 2.3). Therefore, an algorithm for syntactic choice must incorporate goals characterized by when s</context>

SPUD’s knowledge base keeps track of information to be asserted and the information status (discourseand hearer-oldness) and salience of discourse entities (entities, poset relations, and open propositions). Currently, communicative intent is divided into three records: ASSERTIONS, the update to the conversational record that the utterance is intended to achieve PRESUPPOSITIONS, how particular elements in the utterance link to individuals already present in the conversational record PRAGMATICS, requirements on the status of individuals in the discourse In Stone, et al. (2001), only the assertions of an utterance affect the conversational record. The choice of main clause syntactic form is related only to the pragmatics. For example, a transitive verb will be associated with multiple trees; a tree with canonical order can be chosen in any context. A tree with a topicalized order will be associated with the pragmatic requirements discussed in section 2 and will be selected if they are fulfilled Any tree, canonical or non-canonical, associated with the verb will achieve the same update to the conversational record. 3.2 Communicative goals of non-canonical syntax Base</context>

These include the membership of referents in a salient set of discourse entities (leftdislocations and topicalizations), or the salience of particular propositions within the discourse model (topicalizations and clefts). The discourse conditions posited in the literature that allow the felicitous use of these and other non-canonical syntactic forms are necessary conditions. When they do not hold, native speakers judge the use of a non-canonical form infelicitous. They are not, however, sufficient conditions for their use (Vallduvi, 1990). Even when they hold, speakers may choose the option of not using a special form, or alternatively, the use of a special form may still be judged as odd. Moreover, although the use of these forms appears to be optional, in some contexts, substitution of a canonical sentence for the non-canonical yields a difficult-to-interpret discourse. We will illustrate each of these situations below in Section 2. 1.2 Relevance for NLG Even when considering only a single main clause, there are usually many ways to encode propositional content. The purpose of an NLG is not simply to encode propositions as g</context>
