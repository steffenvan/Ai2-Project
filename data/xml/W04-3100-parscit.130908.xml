This volume contains the proceedings of the HLT-NAACL 2004 Workshop: BioLINK 2004, Linking
Biological Literature, Ontologies and Databases, held in Boston on May 6, 2004. Our goal in this
workshop has been to bring together researchers from the fields of bioinformatics, natural language
processing, ontologies, data mining, and information retrieval. We have focused on tools that can
provide improved access and cross-indexing for the biomedical literature, databases and ontologies.
This year’s workshop builds on previous workshops in this area, including two previous ACL
workshops on biomedical text mining (2002: http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/nlpwg/ACL02.html; and
2003: http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ACL03/bionlp.htm), and three meetings of the Special Interest
Group for Text Mining in Biology at the annual meeting of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology: http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/BioLINK.
The workshop features two sessions of plenary talks (six papers) and a poster session at the end of
the workshop. The first session of talks deals with document clustering and text categorization themes;
the second session focuses on resources and techniques for information extraction. The four reviewed
posters are included in the workshop proceedings as extended abstracts. They describe recent work on
developing resources for terminologies and annotation, as well as text mining applications for cross-
linkage of biological resources.
The 2004 workshop is structured to encourage exchange between the ”producers” of text mining
tools from the Human Language Technology community and the ”consumers” of these tools in the
biology community. To this end, there are two invited talks on biologists’ current needs for text
mining: William Hayes on ”Text Mining - Next Steps for Drug Discovery” and Ian Donaldson on
”Text-mining Needs and Solutions for the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND).” The
workshop concludes with a panel of publishers, addressing issues of full text access and applications of
text mining to the biological literature from the publishing perspective. Our aim is to begin a dialogue
with the publishers to explore ways to improve access to the vast free-text resources contained in the
biological literature, as well as to expose the publisher community to the benefits of text mining. In
keeping with the theme of ”tools for users,” we have also invited commercial companies to participate,
to foster exchange between the research community and commercial applications of text mining tools
for biology.
We believe that by bringing together the different stakeholders in this rapidly growing area to focus
on linking biomedical resources and providing improved access through text mining, we can encourage
new research approaches and speed the application of emerging technologies to significant biological
problems.
