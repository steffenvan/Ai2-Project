Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999916">
We address the problem of distinguishing
between two sources of disagreement in
annotations: genuine subjectivity and slip
of attention. The latter is especially likely
when the classification task has a default
class, as in tasks where annotators need to
find instances of the phenomenon of inter-
est, such as in a metaphor detection task
discussed here. We apply and extend a data
analysis technique proposed by Beigman
Klebanov and Shamir (2006) to first dis-
till reliably deliberate (non-chance) anno-
tations and then to estimate the amount of
attention slips vs genuine disagreement in
the reliably deliberate annotations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999456875">
Classification tasks fall into two broad categories.
Those in the first category proceed by requiring
that every item is explicitly assigned a tag out of
a given set of tags; part-of-speech tagging is an
example (Santorini, 1990).
In the second group of tasks, the annotator is
asked to identify a phenomenon of interest, thus
implicitly classifying items as belonging to the
phenomenon (marked) and not belonging to it (left
unmarked). When the studied phenomenon is ex-
pected to have low incidence, this is a time-saving
strategy, as annotators do not need to bother with
explicitly marking (almost) everything as a non-
phenomenon. A recent example of such a task is
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006), where an-
notators were asked to provide anchors for words

deemed anchored in the text (i.e. associatively
connected to a previous item in the text), thus leav-
ing words that did not receive an anchor implic-
itly marked as un-anchored. Psychological exper-
iments where people are asked to respond to the
occurrence of a given phenomenon can also be
viewed as implicit classifications; for example, see
Spiro’s (2007) work on identification of bound-
aries of musical phrases by listeners. The task
of metaphor detection discussed in this paper also
falls under the implicit classification category.
While such a strategy uses annotators’ time effi-
ciently, some of the observed disagreements could
be due to an annotator missing an occurrence of
the relevant phenomenon, rather than genuinely
disagreeing on the matter of occurrence.
We show in section 2 that our metaphor
identification task features less-than-perfect inter-
annotator agreement. Section 3 uses Beigman Kle-
banov and Shamir’s (2006) methodology to find
annotations that can be reliably attributed to a de-
liberate decision by at least some of the annotators.
We then discuss the use of validation experiment to
distinguish between slips of attention and genuine
disagreements (sections 4,5).

2 Metaphor Detection Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938621111111111">
For a project studying the use of metaphors in pub-
lic discourse, a dataset of 151 articles from the
British press was subjected to annotation.&apos; Partic-
ipants were asked to mark paragraphs that contain
occurrences of metaphors from LOVE, VEHICLE,
AUTHORITY and BUILDING domains (hence-
forth, metaphor types).
For example, the following paragraph in 20
September 1992 issue of Sunday Times contains an

extended metaphor from the VEHICLE domain:
Thatcher warned EC leaders to stop their
endless round of summits and take no-
tice of their own people. “There is a
fear that the European train will thunder
forward, laden with its customary cargo
of gravy, towards a destination nei-
ther wished for nor understood by elec-
torates. But the train can be stopped,”
she said.
The title of one of the articles in the 19 Octo-
ber 1999 issue of The Guardian contains a LOVE
metaphor:
Euro-flirting is not only a matter of de-
sire.
The discussion in this paper is based on the out-
put of 9 annotators who performed metaphor iden-
tification (henceforth, production task), and of 7
annotators (out of 9) who took part in the sub-
sequent validation study (henceforth, validation
task). Subjects were not told about validation until
after they finished production on the whole of the
dataset. A time gap of 2 weeks existed between
the end of the production study and the start of
the validation, each of the tasks taking 6 weeks,
in weekly installments of 25 articles each.
For the production task, the annotators were
instructed to mark every paragraph where a
metaphor from the given metaphor type appeared;
the 151-article dataset yields 2364 paragraphs.
This paradigm corresponds to the implicit clas-
sification task discussed earlier, in that only the
positive (metaphor-containing) cases are given an
explicit markup. The incidence of positive cases
is quite low – VEHICLE, the most ubiquitous
type, featured in 4% of the paragraphs, on average
across annotators.
We note that the appearances of the different
metaphor types are not mutually exclusive, and,
indeed, there is no a-priori reason to suppose
any relationship between them. For example, the
following paragraph from the leading article in
15 November 1995 issue of The Guardian was
marked by some annotators as containing both
LOVE and VEHICLE metaphors:
The first European bank notes - proba-
bly to be called “euros” - will not be in

circulation until 2002 judging by yester-
day’s report from the European Mone-
tary Institute. But this doesn’t mean that
monetary union has been delayed be-
yond 1999 because the printing of Euro-
pean bank notes will have been preceded
by a period of three years when na-
tional currencies will have been locked
together in indissoluble monetary matri-
mony [...] Although France looks as if it
might buckle under the strain of meet-
ing the fiscal criteria and in Germany
the SDP is having doubts (though only
about whether the new currency will be
strong enough) the Maastricht train is
still theoretically on the rails. Nobody
has changed the timetable.
We therefore treat the detection of metaphors
from each metaphor type as a separate binary
classification task. Table 1 shows the inter-
annotator agreement for the production task using
the κ statistic (Carletta, 1996; Krippendorff, 1980;
Siegel and Castellan, 1988).

Clearly, it is not the case that the whole of the
dataset was reliably annotated, even for the better-
agreed-upon metaphor types like VEHICLE and
LOVE. Hence, additional procedures are needed
to distill reliable annotations. We apply Beigman
Klebanov and Shamir’s (2006) statistical tech-
nique to find a subset of the data that is sufficiently
reliable, and later corroborate the statistical analy-
sis through the validation task.

3 Reliably Deliberate Annotations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998575666666667">
In Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006), 22
subjects performed the anchoring annotation; the
overall inter-annotator agreement was κ=0.45.

<bodyText confidence="0.999977173913044">
Thus, some of the data was clearly unreliable, as
in our metaphor detection task, but the possibility
existed that some other part was in fact annotated
sufficiently reliably.
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir’s (2006) analy-
sis proceeded thus: Suppose each of the 20 anno-
tators3 (i = 1...20) was flipping a coin with the
probability of heads pi equal to the proportion of
“anchored” markups in annotator i’s data. What
is the level of agreement for which this scenario is
sufficiently improbable? For their data, the random
anchoring hypothesis could be rejected with 99%
confidence for cases marked by at least 13 people.
Items featuring at least this level of agreement can
be considered, with high probability, as deliber-
ately annotated as “anchored”, as at least some of
those who marked them were not flipping a coin.
Following the procedure in Beigman Klebanov
and Shamir (2006), we wish to determine a re-
liably deliberate subset of our metaphor annota-
tions. We induce 9 random pseudo-annotators
from the 9 actual ones, each marking paragraphs
at random as containing a metaphor of a given
type or not. Pseudo-annotator i flips a coin
with p(heads) = pi, which is the proportion of
metaphor markups by the i’th annotator for the
most common metaphor type (VEHICLE).
Assuming each annotator flips her coin, we cal-
culate the probability of 3 or more coins coming up
heads simultaneously;4 this probability is 0.0045.
Thus, with 99.5% confidence, a metaphor markup
by at least 3 people is not a result of coinflip, at
least for some of the annotators. We note, how-
ever, that 99.5% confidence is insufficient for our
case: It allows for random highly agreed markup
in 0.5% of the instances. Given that only up to
4% of the instances have positive markups, this
would yield a high percentage of random items
in the positive instances. The probability of 4 or
more pseudo-annotators having their coins come
up heads simultaneously is below 0.0003; we con-
sider this sufficient confidence for our case, and
regard metaphor markups produced by at least 4
people as reliably deliberate.
Note that we cannot find a similar threshold for
no-metaphor annotations, as a lack of metaphor

3Two people were excluded as outliers.
4In Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006), a normal ap-
proximation is used to handle collective decision making by
20 pseudo-annotators. In the current case, 9 annotators is a
sufficiently small number to allow an exact probability calcu-
lation over the 512 possibilities.

annotation could happen by chance with a high
probability (p = 0.69). In view of the potential use
of the dataset for evaluating metaphor detection
algorithms, a putative metaphor suggested by the
algorithm cannot be rejected based on the lack of
metaphor annotation in the data. A complementary
procedure would be needed, for example, collect-
ing human judgments for the putative metaphors
separately.

4 Attention Slips vs Genuine
Disagreements
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940076923077">
Deliberate annotation does not guarantee agree-
ment. It remained the case that some of the reliably
deliberate data in Beigman Klebanov and Shamir
(2006) was actually produced by only some of the
original subjects. Indeed, some of the deliberately
marked metaphors were annotated by only 4 out
of the 9 participants. For cases where the posi-
tive annotations were produced deliberately, what
is the status of negative annotations accorded to
the same items? Were these mere attention slips,
or genuine differences of opinion? Note that this
question cannot be meaningfully posed regarding
the parts of annotations for which the hypothesis
of random positive marking could not be rejected
with sufficiently high probability, since, obviously,
apparent disagreements there could be simply a re-
sult of different coinflip outcomes.
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006) hypoth-
esized that dissenting annotations of the reliable
pairs would be cases of attention slips, rather than
genuine differences of opinion. In other words,
while there was no initial agreement, these items
were potentially agreeable. To test the hypothe-
sis, they devised a validation experiment, where
subjects were presented with all pairs marked by
at least one annotator, plus some random pairs,
and were asked to cross out things they disagree
with. The reasoning was as follows: If attention
slip was the cause for a dissenting negative anno-
tation, when the subject is asked about the relevant
item, i.e. it is explicitly brought to her attention,
she would accept it, whereas if a case is that of
a genuine disagreement, she would reject it. To
control for the possibility that people just accept
everything so that not to be dissonant with others,
some random annotations were also included.
The results reported by Beigman Klebanov and
Shamir (2006) largely bore out the hypothesis.
First, people did not tend to accept everything,

<bodyText confidence="0.99660644">
as only 15% of judgments of random annota-
tions and only 62% of judgments on all human-
generated annotations were “accept” judgments.
However, 94% of judgments of the reliable anno-
tations were “accept” judgments. Hence, the rate
of genuine disagreement on the reliably deliberate
part of Beigman Klebanov and Shamir’s (2006)
data turned out to be quite low.
We are interested in estimating the degree of
genuine disagreements in metaphor production.
Using Beigman Klebanov and Shamir’s method-
ology, we collected all paragraphs marked as con-
taining a metaphor of a given type by at least one
of the 9 annotators, plus added random markups.
This data was submitted to 7 subjects for valida-
tion.

Table 2 reports the percentage of “accept” votes
for random and human metaphor production data,
as well as for reliably deliberate and unreliable
subsets of the human data. As in Beigman Kle-
banov and Shamir’s case, the validation experi-
ment clearly distinguishes between random, hu-
man in general, and reliably deliberate subsets, and
puts the estimated degree of genuine disagreement
in metaphor identification at 5% on average, with
little variation across the metaphor types. That
is, given that, with high probability, at least some
humans deliberately identified a paragraph as con-
taining a metaphor, the chance for its rejection is
about 5%. The rest of observed production dis-
agreements, for the reliably deliberate subset, are
remedied at validation time, thus probably consti-
tuting attention slips during production. The reli-
ably deliberate subset contains 33% (238/715) of
all human-generated data.

One potential confounder in the above analysis
is conflation of self-consistency with affirmation
of someone else’s annotations. It is possible that
many of the validation-time “accept” votes are
cases of people accepting their own earlier annota-
tion; the proportion of such cases is expected to in-
crease the more people marked the metaphor dur-
ing production. Therefore, to get a more precise
estimate of the degree of genuine disagreement,
we control for self-affirmation, and calculate the
proportion of “accept” validations in cases where
the person did not mark the metaphor during pro-
duction. Specifically, if X of the 7 people who par-
ticipated in both production and validation marked
the metaphor at production,5 we check the split of
the remaining 7-X votes during validation. Table 3
presents average other-affirmation rates for the re-
liably deliberate and unreliable human produced
data. Note that only 184 out of the 238 deliberately
reliable cases can be used, as the remaining 54 are
cases where all 7 annotators produced the markup,
so there is no disagreement.

According to the table, 91% cases of disagree-
ments in the reliably deliberate data are remedied
at validation time. That is, given that, with high
probability, at least some human deliberately iden-
tified a paragraph as containing a metaphor, the
chance for its rejection by a human who initially
apparently disagreed with the annotation is only
about 9%.
Finally, validation data allows an investigation
of the stability of people’s judgments by calculat-
ing self-rejection rates, i.e. estimating the prob-
ability of rejecting during validation an instance
that the same annotator marked as containing a
metaphor during production. Table 4 shows the
results.
rate means that the relevant production annotations
cannot be trusted to contain a settled judgment that
could be then agreed or disagreed with by other an-
notators, or indeed replicated by a computational
model.
We consider self-rejected cases potential indica-
tors of a difficulty on the annotator’s part to de-
cide on the correct markup. We plan a more de-
tailed investigation of the materials to see whether
these cases exhibit any interesting common prop-
erties that could help characterize the difficulties in
metaphor identification task.

For the reliably deliberate data, i.e. cases where
at least 4 people produced the markup, the average
self-rejection rate is 4%. This low figure further
supports the designation of the reliably deliberate
subset as such, i.e. containing stable annotations,
as in 96% of the cases a person who produced the
markup is likely to re-affirm it when asked again,
even after a substantial time delay.7
For the “unreliable” data, i.e. cases where only
one or two people marked the metaphor during
production, the average self-rejection rate is 23%.
Self-rejection means either that the initial positive
markup was a mistake, or that it is difficult for the
annotator to make up his mind about the annota-
tion of the item. In any case, high self-rejection
6Note that only 385 of the 477 items in the unreliable data
could be used for the calculation. The remaining items were
not produced by any of the 7 people who participated in both
production and validation, but only by one or both of the 2
additional production-task annotators.
7The time difference between production and validation
per article ranged between 4 and 8 weeks, due to differences
in the order in which the different subjects were given the
articles.
In this article, we showed an application of
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir’s (2006) method-
ology for analyzing annotation data to metaphor
identification annotations. The approach allowed
establishing an agreement threshold beyond which
the annotations are reliably deliberate, in the sense
that, with high probability, at least some of the
annotators who detected a metaphor were not flip-
ping a coin. This threshold is agreement of 4 out
of 9 annotators, for 99.9% reliability.
To investigate the nature of disagreements in the
reliably deliberate subset, we followed Beigman
Klebanov and Shamir (2006) in conducting a val-
idation study, where subjects were asked to ac-
cept or reject markups produced during the ini-
tial annotation study, as well as some random
annotations. Sharpening the methodology some-
what, we showed that in 91% of reliably deliber-
ate cases where an annotator did not produce the
markup himself, he accepted it during validation.
Hence, the bulk of the initial disagreements were
amended during validation, with the residual 9%
being likely locations for genuine difference of
opinion.
Further analysis of validation data revealed that
the reliably deliberate subset features low self-
rejection rates, meaning that people are consis-
tent with their own production. This was not the
case for the subset deemed unreliable during sta-
tistical analysis, where a 23% self-rejection rate
was observed. We hypothesize that some of these
would be hard-to-decide cases with respect to the
metaphor identification task, and hence warrant a
closer look in order to characterize annotator diffi-
culties with the task.
