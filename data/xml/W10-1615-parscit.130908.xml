In this paper we propose a method to exploit ana-
lytical definitions extracted from Spanish corpora,
in order to build a lexical network based on the hy-
ponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution
relations. Our method considers the following
steps: (a) the recognition and extraction of defini-
tional contexts from specialized documents, (b) the
identification of analytical definitions on these def-
initional contexts, using verbal predications, (c) the
syntactic and probabilistic analysis of the associa-
tion observed between verbal predication and ana-
lytical definitions, (d) the identification of the hy-
ponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution
relations based on the lexical information that lies
between predications and definitions and other
types of phrases, in particular prepositional phrases
mapped by the preposition de (Eng. of/from).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999977588235294">
Nowadays, the possibility of searching and recog-
nizing lexical relations in definitions occurring in
specialized text corpora is an important task in
computational lexicography and terminology.
In this sense, authors such as Vossen and
Copestake (1993), as well as Wilks, Slator &amp; Gu-
thrie (1995) are pioneers in offering a relevant set
of experiments and techniques about how to identi-
fy hyponymy/hypernymy relations from analytical
definitions, taking into account the underlying as-
sociation that exists between terms and genus
terms.
Complementary to these first attempts for iden-
tifying such lexical relations, Riloff &amp; Shepherd
(2004) argue that while these efforts have been ori-
ented to extract lexical relations from corpus of
general language, it is necessary to focus on do-
main-specific corpora, in order to obtain a special-
ized knowledge that is required for in-depth under-
standing of the subject matter.
In line with the argument formuled by Riloff &amp;
Shepherd, Buiteelar, Cimiano &amp; Magnini (2005)
have proposed several methods for building on-
tologies from text corpora, priorizing the automatic
recognition of syntactic patterns that codify
hyponymy/hyperonymy relations.
Following all these authors, we sketch here a
research project to design a lexical network, fo-
cused on classifying scientific and technical con-
cepts extracted from Spanish text corpora. In par-
ticular, we obtain these concepts by extracting def-
initional contexts (DCs) with terms and definitions
clearly formulated, according to the theoretical
framework developed by Sierra, Alarcon &amp;
Aguilar (2006).
After extracted these DCs, we propose a
method to identify lexical relations between terms
inserted into the DCs. The method considers, on
the one hand, a grammatical analysis for detecting
syntactic patterns that represent term and genus
term, bearing in mind their association through lex-
ical relations such as hyponymy/hyperonymy, part/
whole or attribution relations. On the other hand,
we proposed a semi-automatic evaluation to deter-
mine the degree of accuracy respect to the results
obtained by our method.
The issues that we will deal in this paper are or-
ganized as follows: (a) as a starting point, we ex-
pose briefly the theoretical framework to extract
DCs from Spanish corpora. (b) According to this
framework, we describe how analytical definitions

linked to terms can be identified, considering the
identification of verbal predications that function
as connectors between such definitions and terms.
(c) Thus, we offer a probabilistic evaluation for de-
termining the degree of association between pre-
dications and analytical definitions. (d) After this
evaluation, we sketch a method for exploiting this
association between predications and definitions,
in order to identify lexical relations, specifically
hyponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution
relations.

2 Theoretical framework: DC extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.92375997368421">
We situate our analysis within the framework of
definitional contexts (or DCs) extraction. Accord-
ing to Sierra et al. (2008), a DC is a discursive
structure that contains relevant information to de-
fine a term. DCs have at least two constituents: a
term and a definition, and usually linguistic or met-
alinguistic forms, such as verbal phrases, typo-
graphical markers and/or pragmatic patterns. An
example is:
(1) La cuchilla fusible [Term] se define como [Verbal
Phrase] un elemento de conexión y desconexión
de circuitos eléctricos [Definition]. (Engl. The
fuse-switch disconnector is defined as an ele-
ment of connection and disconnection of
electric circuits).
In (1), the term cuchilla flexible is emphasized by
the use of bold font, and it appears linked with the
verbal predication se define como, and the defini-
tion un elemento de conexión y desconexión de cir-
cuitos eléctricos. Following to Sierra et al. (2008),
we consider the term, the verbal phrase and the
definition as the three main units constituting the
syntactic structure of a DC.
This kind of syntactic structure introduces an
analytical definition (in the Aristotle&apos;s sense),
where the genus term is represented by a noun
phrase (NP) un elemento and the differentia is rep-
resented by a prepositional phrase (PP) de conex-
ión y desconexión de circuitos eléctricos.
In a detailed analysis on these syntactic struc-
tures, Aguilar (2009) explains that these structures
are predicate phrases (PrP), according to the de-
scription proposed by Bowers (1993, 2001). A PrP
is a phrase mapped by a functional head, and its
grammatical behavior is similar to other functional
phrases such as Inflexional Phrase (IP) or Comple-
ment Phrase (CP). A graphical tree representation
of a PrP is:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.657171">
Figure 1: Tree representation for PrP, according to
Bowers (1993: 596)
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9837535">
The Figure 1 describes the syntactic configuration
of a PrP. We recognise a functional head with the
feature +/- predicative (Pr). This head maps two sub-
jects: a primary subject in the Specifier position of
PrP (represented for a NP); and a secondary sub-
ject, in the Specifier position of verbal phrase or
VP (often a NP). Finally, both subjects, the VP and
the PrP are linked to one or several complements,
which assume phrasal representations (e.g.: NP, IP,
CP, and other types of phrases).
Based on this description about PrP, Sierra et
al. (2008) and Aguilar (2009) observed that both
primary and secondary predications have a close
relation with analytical definitions expressed in
specialized texts. Examples of this relation be-
tween PrP and analytical definitions are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9673469">

<bodyText confidence="0.9998404">
We observe in (2) a canonical primary predication

eletronic machine, and the differentia que sirve
para hacer operaciones. In (3), the predicate como
un mecanismo electrónico... (Engl. as a kind of
electronic device...) affects the secondary subject
una computadora (Engl. a computer), in concord-
ance with the explanation of Bowers (1993). Our
analysis considers both types of predications as
regular patterns that codify syntactically sequences
of terms, verbal predications and definitions.

3 Searching analytical definitions in text
corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99460945">
We have adapted the predicative patterns deduced
from our syntactic analysis, in order to search and
find (semi-)automatically analytical definitions
linked to these patterns. So, we conducted an ex-
periment of identification of these definitions in
two text corpora:
•Linguistic Corpus on Engineering (or
CLI). The CLI, prepared by Medina and
others (2004), is a collection of technical
documents in different thematic areas of
engineering, with an extension of 500,000
words, approximately.
•Corpus on Informatics for Spanish (or
CIE). This corpus was built under the su-
pervision of L&apos;Homme and Drouin (2006).
The CIE compiles several documents re-
lated to computer science and informat-
ics. For our experiment we took a portion
of CIE, which contains articles extracted
from Wikipedia. This portion has an ex-
tension of 500,000 words.
Following to Aguilar et al. (2004) and Sierra et al.
(2008), we selected a set of verbs that function as
heads of predicative patterns in Spanish, taking
into account the distinction between primary and
secondary predications.
In the case of primary predication, the analytic-
al definition is integrated in a sequence Term +
Verbal Predication + Definition. This definition
does not refer to possible author(s) of a definition.
An example is:
(4) [El apartarrayos Term] [es Verbal Predication] [un dis-
positivo Genus Term] [que protege las instalacio-
nes contra sobretensiones de origen atmosfé-
rico Differentia] (Engl. [The lightning conductor
Term] [is Verbal Predication] [a device Genus Term] [that
protects electrical systems against surges of
atmospheric origin Differentia]).
Having in mind this sequence, we propose a gram-
matical description model for this relation:

PP = Preposition + NP
AdjP = Adjective + NP
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995032">
The verbs that operate as head of these predica-
tions are: referir (to refer to), representar (to rep-
resent), ser (to be) and significar (to signify/to
mean). In contrast, when a secondary predication
introduces an analytical definition, this predication
follows the sequence Author + Term + Verbal
Predication + Definition, where the Author is equi-
valent to the primary subject, the Term assumes
the position of secondary subject, and the defini-
tion is introduced after the Verbal Predication. In
this case, the adverbial particle como (Eng.
as/like), or the preposition por (Eng. for/by) indic-
ates the place of the definition. An example is:
(5) [Carlos Godino Author] [define Verbal Predication] [la
arquitectura naval Term] [como la ciencia que
se enfoca en la construcción de los buques De-
finition] (Eng. [Carlos Godino Author] [defines
Verbal Predication] [the naval architecture Term] [as
the science that focuses on the construction of
ships Definition])

and visualizar + como (Engl. to visualize + as).
In order to recognize these sequences of predic-
ations and analytical definitions, we employed a
system developed in Python by Rodríguez (2004).
Broadly speaking, the input for this system is a set
of previously delimited text fragments. The output
is a XML table with a list of patterns, the verb used
for searching these patterns, and the frequency of
use in both corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999756793103448">
Once we accomplished the process of searching
and extracting of fragments with sequences of
predication patterns of analytical definitions, we
determined values of precision and recall for the
CLI and CIE corpora based on the real number of
analytical DCs in the corpus. This data was deter-
mined by a human expert through an exploration in
the corpora mentioned above. In table 3 we
showed DC candidates, as well as the real number
of true DCs extracted from these candidates.
Thus, from CLI corpora we obtained a total of
1686 candidates. From these candidates, the human
expert recognized a set of 111 true DCs to analyti-
cal definition linked to primary predication pat-
terns. Our recall was 100% because we obtained
all of the DCs with analytical definitions, but the
precision achieved was very low (6.6%).
The main cause about this low precision is due
to the verb ser (Eng. to be). The verb ser is highly
productive in Spanish, however, much of the frag-
ments found are not analytical definitions. In con-
trast, from secondary predication patterns, our re-
call was 100% and precision 9.4%. Thus, the CIE
corpora showed measures of precision and recall
higher than those of CLI corpora because most of
documents were extracted from resources as
Wikipedia. We suppose this factor is related with a
definition scheme more canonical in scientific and
technical documents.

Once established this distribution, we have ana-
lyzed the degree of assurance to find a good candi-
date for analytical definitions. We have applied a
method of conditional probabilities for primary and
secondary predications. Our conditional probabili-
ties are formulated by the hypothesis that the prob-
ability (P) of co-occurrence of predications (Pred)
linked to analytical definition (AD) is high. Thus,
we apply the following formula of conditional
probability:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9988775">

Therefore, we considered that the possibility to
identify a good candidate of analytical definition is
high, insofar as we took into account their relation-
ship with primary and secondary predications.
In addition, Alarcón, Bach &amp; Sierra (2007),
propose a methodology for filtering true DCs from
a set of candidates to DCs. An important advance
provided for this work is the application of a filter
phase that discards those syntactic patterns without
true analytical definitions. For example, if we find
a particle as no (Eng. not) or tampoco (Eng. either)
in the first position before or after of a predication,
there is a high probability these pattern do not in-
troduce a good analytical definition. In Table 5 we
showed some results in terms of precision and re-
call reported by authors only for analytical defini-
tion patterns.

5 Sketching a method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999448166666667">
In this section, we propose a method for recogniz-
ing lexical relations from the previous extraction of
DCs. In particular, we assume that a good way to
reach these relations is to improve the syntactic as-
sociation observed between predications and ana-
lytical definitions inserted into these DCs.
This assumption is in line with the methodology
proposed by Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp; Magnini (2005)
for building ontologies based on textual informa-
tion obtained from corpora. These three authors
conceive a chain of processes and sub-processes,
represented with a layer cake scheme:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.994697">
Figure 2: Ontology learning layer cake (according to
Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp; Magnani 2005)
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.976627285714286">
Briefly, in this scheme Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp;
Magnini establish a sequence of 6 basic tasks for
developing a possible ontology. Thus, the first task
is the identification of a set of specific terms to a
certain knowledge domain (in this case, a medical
domain). After that, it is necessary to identify syn-
onyms related to these terms (e.g., disease/illness).
Given both sets of terms and synonyms, the fol-
lowing task is to determine concepts in a formal
way. For delineating these concepts, in the next
task are deduced lexical relations following lexical
networks formulated by WordNet (Fellbaum
1998).
Once these lexical relations are established, the
semantic relations are proposed, keeping this in
mind, for example, first-order logic to represent
predicate-arguments structures. The final process
of this chain is to derive universal rules for build-
ing concepts, joining lexical and semantic relations
deduced previously.
Thus, the recognition and extraction of concepts
is a step towards the general goal proposed by
Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp; Magnini for building ontolo-
gies. For this particular phase, our proposal con-
sists on identifying and extracting conceptual in-
formation through lexical-syntactic patterns as we
mentioned above.
6 Towards the (semi-)automatic identifica-
tion of lexical relations
In agreement with the methodology of Buitelaar,
Cimiano &amp; Magnini mentioned above, we propose
to extract lexical relations from analytical defini-
tions for covering the next step about hierarchical
relations. Hiponymy/hypernymy and
meronym/holonymy relations are considered as re-

lations organizing a conceptual space in a hierarch-
ical way (Winston, Chaffin &amp; Herrmann 1987).
Additionally, our method provides a way to get
more relations from a domain corpus through the
application of a bootstrapping technique with the
genus terms/wholes set as seed set.

• Hyponymy/hyperonymy relations: We
consider works such as Hearst (1992), as
well as Wilks, Slator &amp; Guthrie (1995),
because their methods allow combining
linguistic and probabilistic criteria.
• Part/whole relations: In this case, we
consider works such as Charniak &amp;
Berland (1999), as well as those results
reported by Girju, Badulescu &amp; Mod-
olvan (2006). We propose a method ex-
ploiting the pattern with preposition de,
due to its use frequency to link parts and
wholes in Spanish. Table 6 shows exam-
ples about meronymy/holonymy relations
using this pattern compared with other
patterns worked in the literature.

• Attribution relations: Attribution rela-
tions play an important role in disciplines
involved with conceptual representation
as artificial intelligence/knowledge repre-
sentation, linguistics and psychology
(Poesio &amp; Almuhareb, 2005). So, we
consider the work about the automatic
extraction of attribution relations pro-
posed by Poesio &amp; Almuhareb (2004).
They used an approach as that proposed
by Charniak &amp; Berland (1999) but to ex-
tract attribution relations using the pat-
tern:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9915002">
“the * of the C [is|was]”
Here, * represents a potential attribute for
the concept C. In Spanish a common pat-
tern to express attribution relations is the
use of the preposition de, e.g.: edad del
paciente (Eng. age of patient/patient&apos;s
age), altura del paciente (Eng. height of
the patient/ patient&apos;s height), and so on.
Summarizing, our methodology to extract lexical
relations starts with the extraction of hyponymy-
hypernymy relations from analytical DCs. For this
phase we consider a lexical-syntactic approach
due to the regularity of the definition schemes us-
ing predication patterns as those mentioned
above.
Additionally, we propose a bootstrapping
technique starting with the set of genus terms as a
seedset to extract more lexical relations from a
domain corpus. We use the preposition de to link
genus term and other potential terms due to its im-
portance to produce lexical relations of our inter-
est.
For example, in a first phase exploring a do-
main corpus, a genus term as dilatación (Eng. di-
lation) links with a set of two elements {vena,
pupila} (Eng. {vein, pupil}). In a next phase, the
element pupila is linked to ojo (Eng. eye), and so
on. Thus, on the one hand we have two relations
IS-KIND-OF: dilatación de la pupila and dilat-
ación de la vena. On the other hand, we have a
meronymy-holonymy relation: pupila-ojo.
Integrating the three relations described above,
we will implement a lexical network that allows
organizing concepts related to terms. An example
of this possible network is:

<bodyText confidence="0.999946714285714">
sub−terms operate as nodes, and the possible lexic-
al relations are branches connected with the main
term. Thus, based on a lexical Parth/whole relation,
we can infer that córnea (Eng. cornea), is a con-
stituent of eye. In contrast, the term enfermedad
(Engl. disease) is an attribute of eye. Finally, the
glaucoma is a type of disease that affects the eyes.

In this paper we proposed a method for recogniz-
ing lexical relations, taking into account the identi-
fication and extraction of analytical definitions
situated into DCs in Spanish. This extraction con-
siders verbal predications associated to these defin-
itions. So, in order to explain this extraction, we
have showed a formal syntactic analysis, based on
the idea that these predications: (a) could be de-
scribed in terms of predicative phrases, and (b), the
association of predications and analytical defini-
tions has a high frequency of use in specialized
documents. For evaluating this frequency, we have
exposed the results obtained for an experiment of
extraction in two technical corpora.
Currently, we are situated in the phase to imple-
ment and evaluate a new experiment oriented to
the detection of lexical relations between the term
and the genus term formulated for analytical defin-
itions. In particular, we are interested in discover-
ing three types of relations: hyponym/hyperonymy,
part-whole and attribution-entity.
We conclude suggesting some topics of collab-
orations for our potential colleges:
I. The construction of specialized texts
corpora with good candidates of DCs,
having in mind the basic features for
identifying a DC.
II. The implementation of new linguistic
and statistical methods for detecting
and extracting lexical relations from
text corpora.
III. The improvement of search systems,
using these underlying lexical relations
in electronic documents.
IV. Following to Wilks, Slator &amp; Guthrie
(1995), the design of lexical-semantic
tags for recognizing and classifying
concepts in taxonomies.
Similarly, according to Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp;
Magnini, we can use external lexical resources as
Spanish WordNet and Spanish FrameNet (Subirats
2009) for determining and evaluating our lexical
networks, in order to enrich the results that we
could generate.

<abstract confidence="0.999711944444444">In this paper we propose a method to exploit analytical definitions extracted from Spanish corpora, in order to build a lexical network based on the hyponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution relations. Our method considers the following steps: (a) the recognition and extraction of definitional contexts from specialized documents, (b) the identification of analytical definitions on these definitional contexts, using verbal predications, (c) the syntactic and probabilistic analysis of the association observed between verbal predication and analytical definitions, (d) the identification of the hyponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution relations based on the lexical information that lies between predications and definitions and other types of phrases, in particular prepositional phrases by the preposition of/from).</abstract>

This corpus was built under the supervision of L&apos;Homme and Drouin (2006). The CIE compiles several documents related to computer science and informatics. For our experiment we took a portion of CIE, which contains articles extracted from Wikipedia. This portion has an extension of 500,000 words. Following to Aguilar et al. (2004) and Sierra et al.

In the case of primary predication, the analytical definition is integrated in a sequence Term + Verbal Predication + Definition. This definition does not refer to possible author(s) of a definition.

In (3), the predicate como un mecanismo electrónico...

Our analysis considers both types of predications as regular patterns that codify syntactically sequences of terms, verbal predications and definitions. 3 Searching analytical definitions in text corpora We have adapted the predicative patterns deduced from our syntactic analysis, in order to search and find (semi-)automatically analytical definitions linked to these patterns.

Thus, the first task is the identification of a set of specific terms to a certain knowledge domain (in this case, a medical domain). After that, it is necessary to identify synonyms related to these terms (e.g., disease/illness). Given both sets of terms and synonyms, the following task is to determine concepts in a formal way. For delineating these concepts, in the next task are deduced lexical relations following lexical networks formulated by WordNet (Fellbaum 1998). Once these lexical relations are established, the semantic relations are proposed, keeping this in mind, for example, first-order logic to represent predicate-arguments structures. The final process of this chain is to derive universal rules for building concepts, joining lexical and semantic relations deduced previously. Thus, the recognition and extraction of concepts is a step towards the general goal proposed by Buitelaar, Cimiano &amp; Magnini for building ontologies. For this particular phase, our proposal consists on identifying and extracting conceptual information through lexical-syntac</context>

In Spanish a common pattern to express attribution relations is the use of the preposition de, e.g.: edad del paciente (Eng. age of patient/patient&apos;s age), altura del paciente (Eng. height of the patient/ patient&apos;s height), and so on.

In order to recognize these sequences of predications and analytical definitions, we employed a system developed in Python by Rodríguez (2004). Broadly speaking, the input for this system is a set of previously delimited text fragments. The output is a XML table with a list of patterns, the verb used for searching these patterns, and the frequency of use in both corpora. 4 Results Once we accomplished the process of searching and extracting of fragments with sequences of predication patterns of analytical definitions, we determined values of precision and recall for the CLI and CIE corpora based on the real number of analytical DCs in the corpus. This data was determined by a human expert through an exploration in the corpora mentio</context>

(c) Thus, we offer a probabilistic evaluation for determining the degree of association between predications and analytical definitions. (d) After this evaluation, we sketch a method for exploiting this association between predications and definitions, in order to identify lexical relations, specifically hyponymy/hyperonymy, part/whole and attribution relations. 2 Theoretical framework: DC extraction We situate our analysis within the framework of definitional contexts (or DCs) extraction. According to Sierra et al. (2008), a DC is a discursive structure that contains relevant information to define a term. DCs have at least two constituents: a term and a definition, and usually linguistic or metalinguistic forms, such as verbal phrases, typographical markers and/or pragmatic patterns. An example is: (1) La cuchilla fusible [Term] se define como [Verbal Phrase] un elemento de conexión y desconexión de circuitos eléctricos [Definition]. (Engl. The fuse-switch disconnector is defined as an element of connection and disconnection of electric circuits). In (1), the term cuchilla flexible is emphasized by the use of </context>

We recognise a functional head with the feature +/- predicative (Pr). This head maps two subjects: a primary subject in the Specifier position of PrP (represented for a NP); and a secondary subject, in the Specifier position of verbal phrase or VP (often a NP). Finally, both subjects, the VP and the PrP are linked to one or several complements, which assume phrasal representations (e.g.: NP, IP, CP, and other types of phrases). Based on this description about PrP, Sierra et al. (2008) and Aguilar (2009) observed that both primary and secondary predications have a close relation with analytical definitions expressed in specialized texts. Examples of this relation between PrP and analytical definitions are: (2) [Una computadora [es [un tipo de máquina electrónica que sirve para hacer operaciones PrP] VP] IP] (Eng. [A computer [is [a kind of electronic machine used to make operations PrP] VP] IP]). (3) [Turing [define una computadora [como un mecanismo electrónico que procesa conjuntos de datos PrP] VP] IP] (Eng. [Turing [defines a computer [as a kind of electronic device tha</context>

The CLI, prepared by Medina and others (2004), is a collection of technical documents in different thematic areas of engineering, with an extension of 500,000 words, approximately. •Corpus on Informatics for Spanish (or CIE). This corpus was built under the supervision of L&apos;Homme and Drouin (2006). The CIE compiles several documents related to computer science and informatics. For our experiment we took a portion of CIE, which contains articles extracted from Wikipedia. This portion has an extension of 500,000 words. Following to Aguilar et al. (2004) and Sierra et al. (2008), we selected a set of verbs that function as heads of predicative patterns in Spanish, taking into account the distinction between primary and secondary predications. In the case of primary predication, the analytical definition is integrated in a sequence Term + Verbal Predication + Definition. This definition does not refer to possible author(s) of a definition. An example is: (4) [El apartarrayos Term] [es Verbal Predication] [un dispositivo Genus Term] [que protege las instalaciones contra sobretensiones de origen atmosfé- rico Differentia] (Engl.
