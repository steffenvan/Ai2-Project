<bodyText confidence="0.999541193548387">
In this paper we briefly describe our super-
vised machine learning approach for dis-
order mention detection system that we
submitted as part of our participation in
the SemEval-2014 Shared task. The main
goal of this task is to build a system that
automatically identifies mentions of clini-
cal conditions from the clinical texts. The
main challenge lies due in the fact that the
same mention of concept may be repre-
sented in many surface forms. We develop
the system based on the supervised ma-
chine learning algorithms, namely Condi-
tional Random Field and Support Vector
Machine. One appealing characteristics of
our system is that most of the features for
learning are extracted automatically from
the given training or test datasets with-
out using deep domain specific resources
and/or tools. We submitted three runs, and
best performing system is based on Condi-
tional Random Field. For task A, it shows
the precision, recall and F-measure values
of 50.00%, 47.90% and 48.90%, respec-
tively under the strict matching criterion.
When the matching criterion is relaxed, it
shows the precision, recall and F-measure
of 81.50%, 79.70% and 80.60%, respec-
tively. For task B, we obtain the accuracies
of 33.30% and 69.60% for the relaxed and
strict matches, respectively.

The purpose of this task is to enhance current
research in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
methods used in the clinical domain. The task is
a continuation of the CLEF/eHealth ShARe 2013
Shared Task. In particular there were two specific
tasks, viz. (i). Task A: To identify disorder men-
tions from biomedicine domain and (ii) Task B:
To classify each mention with respect to the Uni-
fied Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept
Unique Identifier (CUI). The task is challenging
in the sense that the same mention of concept may
be represented in many surface forms and men-
tion may appear in the different parts of texts.
Some systems (Cogley et al., 2013; Zuccon et al.,
2013; Tang et al., 2013; Cogley et al., 2013) are
available for disorder mention detection. Look-
ing at the challenges and resources available at
our hand we planned to adapt our existing system
(Sikdar et al., 2013) for disorder mention detec-
tion. The original architecture was conceptualized
as part of our participation in the BioCreative-IV
Track-2 Shared Task on Chemical Compound and
Drug Name Recognition. Although our submit-
ted system for SemEval-14 shared task is in line
with BioCreative-IV1, it has many different fea-
tures and characteristics.
We develop three systems (e.g. Model-1:
sikdar.run-0, Model-2: sikdar.run-1 and Model-
3: sikdar.run-2) based on the popular supervised
machine learning algorithms, namely Conditional
Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vap-
nik, 1995; Joachims, 1999). The models were de-
veloped by varying the features and feature tem-
plates. A baseline model is constructed by us-
ing the UMLS MetaMap2 tool. During testing
we merge the development set with the train-
ing set. Evaluation results on test data with the
benchmark set up show the F-measure values of

the strict criterion. Under relaxed matching cri-
terion the models show the F-measure values of
80.60%, 78.20% and 79.60%, respectively. Our
submission for Task-B is simple in nature where
we consider only those mentions that are also pre-
dicted in the baseline model, i.e. only the com-
mon CUIs are considered. It shows the accuracies
of 33.30%, 31.90% and 33.20%, respectively un-

2 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897375">
Our method for disorder mention detection from
clinical text is based on the supervised machine
learning algorithms, namely CRF and SVM. The
key focus was to develop a system that could be
easily adapted to other domains and applications.
We submitted three runs defined as below:
Model-1:sikdar.run-0: This is based on CRF,
and makes use of the features as mentioned below.
Model-2:sikdar.run-1: This model is built by
training a SVM classifier with the same set of
features as CRF.
Model-3:sikdar.run-2: This model is constructed
by defining a heuristics that looks at the outputs
of both the models. For given instance, if one of
the models predicts it to belong to the category
of candidate disorder mention then this is given
more priority in assigning the class. We observed
performance improvement on the development set
with this heuristic.
We identify and implement different features,
mostly without using any deep domain knowledge
or domain-specific external resources and/or tools.
The features that are used to train the classifiers are
briefly described below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.916344666666667">
• Context words: Surrounding words carry ef-
fective information to identify disorder men-
tion. In our case we consider the previous
three and next three words as the features.
• MetaMap match: MetaMap is a widely used
tool that maps biomedical mention to the
UMLS CUI3. In UMLS, there are 11 seman-
tic types denoting disorders. These are Con-
genital Abnormality, Acquired Abnormality,
Injury or Poisoning, Pathologic Function,
3http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/
Disease or Syndrome, Mental or Behavioral
Dysfunction, Cell or Molecular Dysfunction,
Experimental Model of Disease, Anatomical
Abnormality, Neoplastic Process and Signs
and Symptoms. The training set is passed
through the MetaMap, and then we prepare a
list of mentions that belong to the UMLS se-
mantic types. A feature is thereafter defined
that takes a value of 1 if the current token ap-
pears in the list; otherwise the value becomes
0.
• Part-of-Speech (PoS) Information: In this
work, we use PoS information of the current
token as the feature. PoS information was
extracted from the GENIA tagger4 V2.0.2,
which is a freely available resource.
• Root words: Stems or root words, which
are extracted form GENIA tagger V2.0.2, are
used as the feature.
• Chunk information: We use GENIA tagger
V2.0.2 to extract the chunk information. It
helps to identify the boundaries of disorder
mentions.
• Initial capital: The feature is set to true if the
first character of the current token is a capital
letter.
• All capital: The feature is set to true if all the
letters of the current token are capitalized.
• Stop words: A feature is defined that is set
to one if the current token appears in the list
of stop words.
• Word normalization: Word shapes refer to
the mapping of each word to their equiva-
lence classes. Each capitalized character of
the word is replaced by ‘A’, small characters
are replaced by ‘a’ and digits are replaced by
‘0’.
• Word suffix and prefix: These features in-
dicate the fixed-length character sequences
(here 4) stripped either from the end (suffix)
or beginning positions of words. This is use-
ful in the sense that disorder mentions share
some common sub-strings.

• Unknown word: This feature is imple-
mented depending upon whether the current
token was found during training or not. For
the training set this has been set randomly.
• Word length: If the length of a token is more
than a predefined threshold (here 5) then it is
most likely a disorder mention. This feature
is defined with the observation that very short
words are most probably not disorder men-
tions.
• Alpha digit: If the current token contains
digit character(s), then the feature is set to
true otherwise false.
• Informative words: This feature is devel-
oped from the training dataset. The words or

In SemEval-2014 Shared task 7, three types of
data were provided- training, development and
test. Training data contains four different types
of notes- discharge, ecg, echo and radiology. De-
velopment data consists of notes of three different
domains, viz. discharge, echo and radiology. But
the test set contains only the discharge notes. For
a given document, the start and end indices are
mentioned for the disorder mentions. There are
199, 99 and 133 documents in the training, devel-
opment and test set, respectively.

3.2 Results and Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999526">
We use a regular expression based simple pattern
(e.g. dot and space) matching techniques for the
sentence splitting and tokenization. We use C++
based CRF++ package5 for CRF experiments. We
set the default values of the following parame-
ters (a). the hyper-parameter of CRF. With larger
value, CRF tends to overfit to the given training
data; (b). parameter which sets the cut-off thresh-
old for the features (default value is 1). CRF uses
only those features, having more than the cut-off
threshold in the given training data.
In case of SVM we used YamCha6 toolkit
along with TinySVM7. We use the polynomial
kernel function of degree two. In order to denote
the boundaries of a multi-word disorder mention
properly we use the standard BIO encoding
scheme, where B, I and O represent the beginning,
intermediate and outside, respectively, for a
multi-word token. Please note that the mentions
are not continuous, i.e. they could appear at the
various positions of the text. For example, in the
sentence The left atrium is moderately dilated,
there is a single mention left atrium dilated. Its
BIO format is represented in Table 1.

termine the best configuration. We define a base-
line model by passing the development set to the
UMLS MetaMap tool. Its results along with the
baseline model are reported in Table 2 for Task A.
Evaluation shows that our proposed system per-
forms reasonably better compared to the baseline
model. It is also to be noted that Model-1 performs
better compared to the other two submitted mod-
els for the strict matching, but for relaxed evalu-
ation, Model-3 performs better than Model-1 and
Model-2. Under strict matching criterion, Model-
1 achieves 2.7% and 5.0% increments in precision
over the second and third models, respectively.
For relaxed matching, Model-3 achieves 4.9% and
6.9% increments in recall over the first and sec-
ond models, respectively. Results on the develop-
ment set for Task-B are reported in Table 3. Please
note that although our system performs better than
the baseline in terms of strict matching, it does not
show better accuracy under relaxed matching cri-
terion. This is because our system for Task-B is
developed by considering only those mentions that
lie in the intersection of baseline and CRF models.
As a result many mentions are missed. During fi-
nal submissions we merged development sets with
the respective training sets, and perform evalua-
tion on the test sets. We report our results on the
test sets in Table 4 and Table 5 for Task-A and
Task-B, respectively.
We carefully analyze the results and find that
most of the errors encountered because of the dis-
contiguous mentions. Different components of a
mention may be mapped to the different concepts.
In our system we treat two mentions as a single

unit if they have some shared tokens. For exam-
ple, the sentence “She also notes new sharp pain in
left shoulder blade/back area” contains two differ-
ent mentions, viz.“pain shoulder blade” and “pain
back”. Here shared word of these two mentions
is “pain”, but we consider these two mentions as
a single unit such as “pain shoulder blade back”.
This contributes largely to the errors that our sys-
tem faces for the first task. For the second task,
we miss a number of mentions, and this can be
captured if we directly match the system identified
mentions to the entire UMLS database.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998285">
In this paper we report on our works as part of our
participation in the SemEval-2014 shared task re-
lated to clinical text mining. We submitted three
runs for both the tasks, viz. disorder mention de-
tection and disambiguation. Our submitted runs
for the first task are based on CRF and SVM. We
make use of a set of features that are not very
domain-specific. The system developed for the
second task is very simple and is based on UMLS
Meta Map tool.
There are many avenues for future research:
identification of more features for the first task;
use of some domain-specific resources and/or
tools for the first task; use of entire UMLS the-
saurus for mapping the disorder mentions; use
of some machine learning techniques for disam-
biguation. We also plan to investigate how sys-
tematic feature selection, ensemble learning and
machine learning optimization have impact on dis-
order mention detection and disambiguation.
