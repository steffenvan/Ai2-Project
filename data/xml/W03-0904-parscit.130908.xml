In this paper, we briefly and informally illus-
trate, using a few annotated examples, the
static and dynamic knowledge resources of on-
tological semantics. We then present the main
motivations and desiderata of our approach
and then discuss issues related to making onto-
logical-semantic applications feasible through
the judicious stepwise enhancement of static
and dynamic knowledge sources while at all

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960632">
This paper discusses selected issues in ontological se-
mantics (OS), an implemented computational-semantic
theory that deals with the extraction, representation and
use of meaning in natural language texts. Unlike practi-
cally all other work in computational semantics, OS
makes itself responsible for all the necessary compo-
nents and stages in automatic text meaning analysis: it
addresses lexical and compositional meaning as well as
pragmatics and discourse issues. Its processing heuris-
tics are derived from syntax, morphology and other
“preprocessing,” non-semantic analysis stages that are
still incorporated in the system, as well as from detailed
underlying world models that include specifications not
only of basic events, objects and properties but also of
complex events, or scripts.
The goal of OS is the extraction, representation and
manipulation of meaning in natural language texts with
a view toward supporting applications such as MT or
question answering. Text meaning is represented in text
meaning representations (TMRs) that are derived com-
positionally, primarily from meanings of words and
phrases in the text. Word and phrase meaning is en-
coded in the ontological-semantic lexicon. The underly-
ing ontology is the main metalanguage of lexical mean-
ing specification.1 As a result, TMRs largely consist of

course-related meanings that are reflected in TMRs but not in
terms of ontological concepts.

instances of ontological concepts. Some of these in-
stances are remembered (as “facts”) and stored in the
fact repository, FR, a knowledge base of remembered
ontological instances. Some facts in the fact repository
are referred to by proper names in texts–personal
names, toponyms, names of organizations, specific arti-
facts (“the statue of Liberty”), etc. These proper names
are stored in the onomasticon, the semantic zones of
whose entries contain a pointer to a corresponding FR
element.2
The following example illustrates our ontological-
semantic knowledge resources (for a more detailed de-
scription see Nirenburg and Raskin 2003, Chapters 6-
7). The example is much simpler than the sentences
from real texts with which the ontological-semantic
analyzer typically works and is used here for pedagogi-
cal reasons and to save space. Consider the input sen-
tence Alex Patrick makes tools. Morphological and syn-
tactic analysis of this input will yield the following
structure (throughout this paper we use a presentation
notation that is simplified for readability):

2 State-of-the-art techniques for recognizing named entities
not in the onomasticon are incorporated in the analyzer; for
example, lists of personal names from various languages are

In the above entry, the variables are used for link-

ARTIFACT is an ontological concept (ontological con-
cepts are in SMALL-CAPS); AGENT and THEME are
among its case roles and are used in this lexicon entry
to specify selectional restrictions on this sense of make.
As it happens, the selectional restrictions listed in the
ontological definition of the concept CREATE-ARTIFACT
are sufficient for this case of make, so that no further
specialization or generalization of these restrictions in
the lexicon is required.

In general, constraints in lexicon entries can modify and
supplant those listed in the ontology; this is a means of
controlling the proliferation of ontological concepts in
the system. Lexicon entries for the appropriate senses
of the other elements of the input sentence are as fol-
lows (we assume that the FR does not include an Alex

1.1 Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968722222222">
A number of important representational and processing
issues have been omitted in this presentation, notably, a
discussion of disambiguation heuristics. The first-line
mechanism of ambiguity resolution in OS is matching
selectional restrictions. In our example, selectional re-
strictions on the theme of the proposition head matched
successfully: indeed, tools are artifacts. As to the re-
strictions on the agent, they have been found to be too
weak to resolve the ambiguity completely: both the last-
name and the first-name (not shown) sense of Patrick fit
the selectional restrictions on the proposition head (in-
deed, Alex Patrick may be also be a double first name).
Additional disambiguation means are required in this
case.
We have developed two general methods for addi-
tional sense disambiguation: dynamic tightening of se-
lectional restrictions (Mahesh et al., 1997) and deter-
mining weighted distances among ontological concepts
activated in the input (using the Ontosearch procedure,
e.g., Onyshkevych, 1997). None of these methods will,
incidentally, help in our example, so that additional
heuristic procedures will have to be built for this type of
ambiguity. Incidentally, such heuristic procedures could
include evidence from a wide variety of sources, in-
cluding text corpora. Supporting semantic analysis in
this way should become an important direction of work
in corpus-oriented computational linguistics (see further
discussion below).
Residual ambiguity is one of several possible initial
outcomes of the analysis process. Figure 1 illustrates
the entire set of possible outcomes of the analyzer op-
eration. Note that, in principle, the single-candidate
outcome may prove to be less than ideal–it might sim-
ply reflect errors and omissions in static knowledge re-
sources. Still, at this time deriving a single output
serves as the halting condition of the analysis process.

If Alex Patrick were the name of a company (cf.
Merrill Lynch) and were not listed in the FR and there
were no textual clues (e.g., Inc.) to recognize it as such,
the system would fail to produce the correct analysis
(that is, we would end up with zero candidate out-
comes). Currently, the only way to rectify this state of
affairs is to (manually) add to the fact repository an in-
stance of CORPORATION with the name Alex Patrick and
all its known property values. However, we are working
on coercion rules that in the above example would fa-
vor the corporation reading if the event in question had
the selectional restriction CORPORATION in the appro-
priate case role.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995846">
1.2 Multivalued Selectional Restrictions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942363636364">
Returning to our original example, if Alex Patrick is a
corporation, then the selectional restrictions on CREATE-
ARTIFACT will be violated (a company is not a human).
As a result, the corporation sense will always lose to the
human sense because in the latter case selectional re-
strictions do match! We have, naturally, noted that or-
ganizations are often used in texts in positions that are
“officially” occupied by people; indeed, this is one of
the most widespread types of metonymy. We therefore
decided to relax the selectional restrictions in such
cases by introducing a relaxable-to facet for property
fillers, in addition to the rigid value and abductively
overridable sem facets. This amounted to the introduc-
tion of multivalued selectional restrictions. Matches on
fillers of sem facets are preferred but matches on fillers
of relaxable-to facets are not discarded as wrong. If, as
in our example, ambiguity results, additional means of
its resolution are used.
Multivalued selectional restrictions are also used to
treat metonymy: e.g., the THEME of PLAY-MUSICAL-
INSTRUMENT is constrained to MUSIC-PIECE but the
standard metonymy of composer name will be also
noted in the same lexicon entry, together with its ex-
pansion to MUSIC-PIECE with the property AUTHORED-
BY filled by the metonym.
Processing unexpected input (including lexically
unaccounted for metonymies) can be done dynamically
using Ontosearch. To treat metonymies, Ontosearch
calculates whether the ontological distance between the
metonym and the selectional restriction that it must
match is below a preset threshold (in which case dy-
namic relaxation is allowed and the case is declared
true metonymy).

1.3 More Expressive Means in OS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984215918918919">
The Alex Patrick example illustrated some of the issues
involved in building a basic semantic dependency. On-
tological semantics, however, goes beyond that limit
and into what is traditionally covered in pragmatics and
discourse – on the assumption that, since these types of
meanings are expressed in language they ought to be
represented and manipulated. The following example
illustrates both the treatment of additional types of
meaning and additional expressive means in OS.
The English verb prevent has two senses in the on-
tological-semantic lexicon. The first sense is used, for
example, in The union organizer prevented a strike.
The basic meaning of prevent-v1 can be roughly
glossed as “the union organizer carried out an unnamed
action or actions as a result of which a strike that was
looming did not materialize.”
In the sem-struc zone of prevent-v1, the meaning of
the syntactic subject (^$var1) has selectional restric-
tions on two facets (sem and relaxable-to). The precon-
dition for the preventive event is the potential of the
thing that is being prevented. The effect is that the thing
that was prevented did not materialize. This is encoded
using value ranges of certain modalities of the event.
Modalities in OS are means of expressing speaker atti-
tudes toward various elements of meaning (or even en-
tire TMRs). Potential modality reflects the probability
of a certain event or state of affairs taking place; epis-
temic modality measures the degree of factivity of the
elements in its scope. Modalities are attributed to spe-
cific sources and take their values from abstract value
ranges between 0 and 1. Epistemic modality 0 means
that the event did not take place.3
3 Ontological semantics recognizes modalities other than epis-
temic and potential. The inventory of modalities continues to
grow and develop – witness the differences between the ac-
counts in Nirenburg and Raskin 2003, Section 8.5.3. and in
Nirenburg et al. (in preparation).

The second sense of prevent is the one used, for exam-
ple, in Negotiations prevented a strike. Here the mean-
ing is expressed as a CHANGE-EVENT: the event that is
the meaning of the subject (A$var1) caused this change
event; there was a potential for A$var2 to take place; as
a result of this change, A$var2 has not taken place (its
epistemic modality is 0). There is no need for overt
specification of time dependencies, as causality deter-
mines temporal ordering. (Note that the syntactic ana-
lyzer currently used in OS recognizes certain –ing
forms, e.g., striking, as nouns.)

The above entries are simplified. For instance, we
did not show the treatment of generic, timeless state-
ments like Being well prepared prevents unpleasant
surprises, whose meaning specification does not in-
volve creating a specific instance of either of the two
events but rather a so-called generic ontological in-
stance representing any element of the class (e.g., tigers
in tigers are ferocious). A special heuristic rule will be
used in this case to determine whether generic ontologi-
cal instances are appropriate. One clue that casts a vote
for the generic reading is the present simple form of the
verb, which is often associated with timelessness. An-
other is the indefiniteness of the direct object. However,
these clues do not always guarantee that the statement
is indeed generalized. One way to ascertain this fact is
to call a special procedure to check whether A$var2 co-
refers with a specific concept instance either in the
TMR or in the fact repository.
Procedures such as the above are called meaning
procedures. For example, the meaning of intensifiers
(e.g., very) is best expressed in terms of a meaning pro-
cedure – take the meaning of the adjective modified by
very; it will be expressed as a range on some scale, e.g.,
the meaning of dim will be the range (&lt;&gt; 0.1 0.4) on
the scale of BRIGHTNESS. Relative values of such prop-
erties are expressed as ranges on abstract scales be-
tween 0 and 1. The expected absolute boundaries for
such properties will be defined in the corresponding on-
tological concepts. Thus, while the HEIGHT property of
HUMAN-ADULT may be marked as the range between
145 and 200 cm (these values are, in fact, overridable),
the corresponding values for PROFESSIONAL-
BASKETBALL-PLAYER may be between 180 and 230 cm.
Values on relative scales can, thus, be resolved to
ranges on absolute scales. The meaning of very roughly
amounts to narrowing the range toward its extreme.
The presence of meaning procedures demonstrates
that OS combines declarative and procedural semantics:
on the one hand, knowledge in OS is separated from the
processing engines; on the other hand, meaning is cal-
culated dynamically.

2. Some Distinguishing Features of OS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994333">
The above, we hope, has presented an informative
glimpse into the representational, descriptive and proc-
essing concerns of OS. Space restrictions prevent us
from describing the many remaining elements of and
decisions taken in OS. At this point, we’ll attempt to
summarize important preferences and tenets of our “op-
erational philosophy” that distinguish our work from
other work and generally characterize OS.
The overall emphasis in the development of OS is
given to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989657">
• maintaining and improving a comprehensive mean-
ing extraction and representation system;
• gradual enhancement of both the breadth and the
depth of description (which stand in a trade-off re-
lation relative to a given amount of resources)
through a large-scale descriptive effort;
• formulation of heuristics for extracting intended
meanings and supporting task-oriented processing;
• attaining adequate descriptive coverage of the mass
of “uninteresting” linguistic phenomena that ac-
count for a huge majority of occurrences in texts.
Relatively lower (though not zero) priorities are ac-
corded to the study of:
• capabilities of the representation medium;
• computational complexity of the processes;
• consistency of the knowledge base;
• individual “interesting” linguistic cases that are dif-
ficult for people to describe and judge (e.g., com-
plex issues in quantification).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946215384615">
Ontological semantics is a comprehensive approach that
does not relinquish responsibility for attaining its goal
to other areas of study or rely on prerequisites that are
either beyond the reach of the current state of the art or
are expected as a result of large amounts of research by
others. It is for this reason that OS includes in its pur-
view all the preprocessing stages in text analysis: to-
kenization, morphology and syntax. Moreover, its pur-
view is broader than that of traditional formal or lexical
semantics: for example, it does not see a need to sepa-
rate pragmatics and discourse into separate disciplines
(allowing, for example, formal semanticists to bypass
many kinds of meaning description on account of their
being outside the purview of their theories).
Ontological semantics seeks to incorporate all the
relevant topics often studied in relative isolation. These
topics include language- and knowledge-related issues
such as aspect, modality, time, causality, quantification,
text-level relations, non-literal meaning, style, deduc-
tive and abductive presuppositions and entailments,
nominal compounds, prepositional phrase attachment,
the meaning of adjectives that do not semantically mod-
ify their syntactic governors, etc. They also include ar-
chitecture and control issues connected with optimizing
the search for the best semantic analysis in the poten-
tially very large candidate space. We strive to develop
our own accounts (we call them “microtheories”) for
each such topic exploiting the research findings of oth-
ers and modifying and expanding them in accordance
with the practical goals and needs of OS. Unfortunately,
no feasible solutions have been proposed in the litera-
ture for most microtheories that we need: much of the
reported work is devoted to rather narrow topics (for
example, meanings of single words at a grain size be-
yond the capabilities – and often the needs – of the ana-
lyzer) and still other proposals invent very complex
formal notations without any emphasis on heuristics for
the assignment of values to language phenomena. (In-
deed, one of the knowledge acquisition rules of thumb
in OS is not to include in the descriptions everything
that can be said, only those parts that are actually use-
ful.)
The purpose of all the microtheories is to help de-
rive text meaning. Some microtheories are driven by
the needs of the meaning representation (its content, not
format). For example, all TMRs must at least attempt to
resolve the deictic indices (speaker, hearer, place, time)
and, more broadly, all references. Other microtheories
are forward-chaining – they are triggered not by the
needs of the output but by the occurrences of certain
lexical and syntactic configurations in the input – for
example, nominal compounds. Developing microtheo-
ries means acquiring heuristic rules for the treatment of
specific phenomena. In OS, the strategy is to use any
and all potentially useful kinds of knowledge in the left-
hand sides of such rules. Some of this knowledge is en-
coded in the static knowledge sources of the system.
Other sources of heuristics include syntactic or morpho-
logical information in the input and general properties
of the input document right down to its formatting
properties. Finally, the heuristic rules can use evidence
from various co-occurrence measures for subsets of in-
put in a corpus. We believe that supporting heuristic
processing in a computational-semantic system is one
of the more useful applications of corpus linguistics.

3. Balancing Desiderata and Practical Con-
straints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998724400000001">
Ontological-semantic descriptive work is guided by the
desiderata of breadth and depth of coverage. Constrain-
ing these, however, are the twin limitations of human
resource availability and the computability of knowl-
edge. In this section we present a number of resource
acquisition choices, each of which is driven by practical
needs and represents a whole class of phenomena
whose continued development occupies the day-to-day
work in OS. We fully understand that it is inappropriate
to talk about a particular ontology or even a particular
lexicon as “the correct one.” While some constraints on
ontology construction may be considered universal,
there are many other equally acceptable choices in
specifying the world model to be used both as the meta-
language for text meaning description and as a major
source for knowledge to support reasoning.
Grain size of static knowledge specification. High
precision in semantic description always incurs in-
creased acquisition time and often increased processing
challenges as well. For this reason, OS explicitly pre-
fers well selected simplifications, defined as those not
expected to noticeably impoverish the usefulness of the
resulting TMR. For example, about in the meaning
travel about Europe is mapped to the spatial relation
INSIDE-OF rather than a) forcing the inclusion of a new
concept with precisely this meaning or b) adding to the
lexicon entry complex inferences or effects – e.g., see-
ing numerous different places. Similarly, the meaning
along as in trees grew along the road is mapped to BE-
SIDE, despite the loss of the precondition that the trees
cover some unspecified stretch of the road interpreted
by the speaker as significant.
Such conscious simplifications – which, we must
emphasize, are always open to finer representation
given the needs of an application and the resulting deci-
sion to thus deploy resources – apply to all aspects of
knowledge acquisition. For example, due to the quag-
mire of semantic and pragmatic issues involved in in-
terpreting conjunctions like and and but when they
serve to link clauses, we level their semantics, creating
a separate TMR for each clause linked by the functional
binder ‘conjoined’. Contrast this with our treatment of
since, because, so that, etc., which are less ambiguous,
more important for reasoning, and are thus rendered by
the concepts CAUSED-BY, EFFECT, and ENABLEMENT, as
applicable.
Another example of methodical simplification con-
cerns the expression of time. Temporal properties of
TMR elements are expressed using a very “lean” set of
parameters: the ontological relations BEFORE (&lt;) and
LONG-BEFORE (&lt;&lt;) and their inverses AFTER (&gt;) and
LONG-AFTER (&gt;&gt;), the concepts START-TIME, END-TIME,
SPEAKER-TIME, DURATION, and time measurement units.
We also define two meaning procedures – find-anchor-
time and combine-time. find-anchor-time attempts to
determine the deictic index, or anchor, relative to which
other times are defined in the text. It uses a variety of
heuristics, including times of events mentioned in the
text as well as the dateline of the text, if available. find-
anchor-time may fail to determine the anchor, in which
case, at present, the time statements in TMRs are made
relative to an unknown time of speech, t0. combine-time
takes as input an anchor time and an expression denot-
ing a time period, one of whose ends is the anchor, and
returns the (actual or relative) time of the combination.
As an illustration, below are abbreviated meaning
representations of some time-related word and phrase
senses:
after-p4 (as in “ten hours after the operation”)
time (combine-time ^$var2.time ^$var3 after)
for-p5 (as in “dribbling for thirty seconds”)
time (duration $var2 (sem TEMPORAL-UNIT))
for-p6 (as in “for the time being”)
time (find-anchor-time)
Always open to reconsideration, these and other such
decisions in favor of a coarse grain size, at a minimum,
help to drive forward the work of supporting our broad-
coverage text processing system.
Economy of expressive means. One tenet of OS is to
avoid a proliferation of ontological concepts, in line
with the recommendation by Hayes (1979) that the ratio
of knowledge elements used to describe a set of ele-
ments of the world to the number of these latter ele-
ments must be kept as low as possible. The factors in-
volved in deciding when and when not to introduce a
new concept constitute something of a cognitive art too
subtle to capture in a thumbnail sketch of a short article;
however, a contrastive example might provide some
insight.
Consider spatial after, as in the first house after the
stop sign. Previous examples showed cases in which an
ontologically available spatial relation was deemed
close enough to describe given lexical entities. In this
case, though, there is no such relation: NEXT-TO, the
best candidate, is inappropriate since the house could be
miles after the stop sign. One option would be to de-
scribe the semantics as a script: the first house one sees
after passing the stop sign during a motion event – but
this was judged too complex. Instead, we went ahead
and added a new spatial relation, AFTER-SPATIAL, to ac-
commodate this and synonymous lexical items from all
the languages that express such a relation (we must em-
phasize that the ontology is language independent). One
reason we did not expend the effort to more fully de-
scribe the semantics of after is that we have not yet de-
veloped a sophisticated microtheory of spatial relations.
Therefore, we are not currently poised to make complex
inferences about spatial relations in texts. However,
when we do ultimately embark upon a microtheory of
spatial relations – either stimulated by the demands of
an application or through the natural overall progres-
sion of ontological-semantic research – we may recon-
sider whether a descriptive rather than an ontological
representation of after would be most beneficial.
The opposite decision was taken in the case of
about and its synonyms when they convey approxima-
tion. Approximation is too important for reasoning for
us to make an ontological concept and consider all ap-
proximated entities thus resolved. Instead, we need
meaning procedures to fix ranges on scales. Preliminary
analysis suggested that a 7% expansion either way
around a magnitude works reasonably well in most
cases: e.g., about 5 gallons is 4.65 to 5.35 gallons;
about 150 lbs. is 139.5 to 160.5 pounds. However the
7% rule produces bad results in some instances: e.g.,
resolving about 6 feet tall to 5’7”-6’5” is bad. What
we need, instead, is 7% of the amount by which peo-
ple’s heights can vary, which is about 2 feet. The 7%
rule applied to 2 feet yields 5’10.5” to 6’1.5” – a much
better reflection of reality. Another failure of the
straightforward 7% rule involves clock time. For prag-
matic reasons, saying around 10 or around 5:30 im-
plies 10 minutes in either direction, whereas around
5:15 permits a smaller range and around 7:07 a smaller
range still. This example of clock time – work on which
is still under way – shows that some issues considered
to be of crucial import to TMRs and the reasoning they
support are immediate priorities in OS despite the over-
head of research and implementation they impose.
Including results of abductive reasoning in TMRs.
To offset any impression that the current state of devel-
opment of OS always opts for shallower analysis, we
offer an example relating to our evolving treatment of
verbs that that have a relatively general meaning despite
the fact that, in a given context, speakers understand
them to carry more meaning.
Consider once again, for example, make in the sense
of create an artifact (i.e., a man-made physical object).
This sense of make, which is only one of many, can
contextually imply different specific types of events
including but not limited to baking (make a cake),
sculpting (make a sculpture), recording (make a CD),
filming (make a film) and knitting (make a sweater).
The verbal sense of make that covers all of these exam-
ples says that make is a CREATE-ARTIFACT event whose
subject is HUMAN and whose object is an ARTIFACT.
Representing this meaning of make as CREATE-
ARTIFACT captures all the meaning that is explicitly
conveyed by this lexical item. In that sense, our analy-
sis should be considered complete. However, we as us-
ers of language know much more precisely what activ-
ity is actually carried out in making a cake: by default,
it’s baking. When we set about to reflect this knowl-
edge in the ontological-semantic knowledge resources,
we list CAKE as a default THEME of BAKE. Whereas in-
heritance in the ontology allows the match of CAKE
with CREATE-ARTIFACT, a more exact, constrained
match obtains between CAKE and BAKE. (Note that
CAKE matches CREATE-ARTIFACT because the THEME of
CREATE-ARTIFACT includes a union of the fillers of
THEME of all its descendants, which include, among
many others, BUILD, PREPARE-FOOD, MAKE-LAW, AU-
THOR-EVENT, FILM-EVENT, RECORD-SOUND, RECORD-
TEXT, CREATE-FABRIC-MATERIAL-ARTIFACT, etc., as
well as their descendants.)
An important question at this point is whether we
should act upon the extra knowledge that cakes are usu-
ally baked or simply allow the correct, though more
vague direct TMR of the input text to stand. The answer
depends on the circumstances of an application. For ex-
ample, in machine translation, all other things being
equal, if the direct TMR can be used as the input to
successful target text generation, there is no need for
any specialization procedure. There are, however, many
cases in which such a procedure would improve the
performance of various analysis tasks. For example,
such a procedure helps to resolve certain ambiguities,
e.g., by preferring the oven to the stove sense of range
in John prepared the cake using the range—see a de-
tailed description in Mahesh et al., 1997. It also helps
in the selection and resolution of referring expressions.
For example, in John made a good cake though the
oven was not hot enough, the definite referring expres-
sion the oven is legitimately used for a discourse-initial
reference—and, therefore, no co-reference resolution
procedure should be called—because the ontology lists
OVEN as the default instrument of BAKE. This type of
inference is ultimately made possible by the availability
of ontological scripts.
In principle, if we decide to carry out proactive ab-
ductive meaning specialization whenever we come
across constructions whose verbs have rather general
meanings (note, incidentally, that many such verbs have
meanings that are even vaguer and less specific than
that of make–consider, for example, such verbs as use,
do, have or get), we can call the meaning procedure
seek-specification in each such case. However, the ana-
lyzer currently triggers specialization exclusively on an
as-needed basis, not proactively because proactive evo-
cation of seek-specification will result in conclusions
that might never be used.
Ontological semantics defines many types of mean-
ing procedures, and their application results in both
more precise and more fine-grain specification of text
meaning. In fact, when all meaning procedures are ap-
plied, the resulting TMR will contain information that
was both overtly present in the original text and infor-
mation abductively inferred form the background
knowledge of the system. We call the former type of
TMR basic and the latter, extended.

In this paper, we first briefly and informally illustrated,
using a few annotated examples, the static and dynamic
knowledge resources of OS. We then presented the
main motivations and desiderata of our approach and
discussed issues relating to how to make ontological-
semantic applications feasible through judicious step-
wise enhancement of static and dynamic knowledge
sources while at all times maintaining a working sys-
tem.
The latest implementation of OS uses an ontology
of about 6,500 concepts each of which is a named col-
lection of property-value pairs (on average, every con-
cept in the current ontology has 16 properties defined
for it), with the “meta-metalanguage” of properties
numbering at the time of this writing about 350 rela-
tions and attributes. The current English lexicon is
about 35,000 entries and growing. There are also Span-
ish and Chinese lexicons, and lexicons for other lan-
guages are under construction. We have also developed
a collection of ever growing onomasticons. The English
onomasticon at present contains over half a million en-
tries. In addition to the lexicons and the ontology, the
static knowledge sources in OS also include morpho-
logical and syntactic grammars to support text analysis
and generation, as well as a growing fact repository.
We are actively developing a variety of ontologi-
cal-semantic microtheories including microtheories of
time, quantification, approximateness, issues relating to
sets and ordered lists, several different aspects of refer-
ence, modality, discourse cohesion, script-based abduc-
tive reasoning. We are also developing pedagogical mi-
crotheories devoted to ontology, lexicon and script ac-
quisition. Additional microtheories are planned for de-
velopment as soon as the current ones reach minimum
utility levels. We continue to augment the basic knowl-
edge resources and are investigating methods of using
current knowledge resources to speed up acquisition of
knowledge resources for languages other than those al-
ready in the system.
We are also developing a system for the automatic
extraction of fact repository elements from TMRs. With
the help of this system, we plan to acquire a large fact
repository that will be used as the search space in the
ontological-semantic approach to information extrac-
tion and question answering.
Many difficulties still remain in the path toward
high-quality, broad-coverage extraction and manipula-
tion of meaning from texts. Still, we believe that the
ontological-semantic approach is on the right path to-
ward this goal – mainly because it is predicated on de-
tailed and flexible descriptive work on language and
world knowledge, does not rely on unattainable or un-
computable prerequisites and is driven by the require-
ments of specific high-end computational-linguistic ap-
plications.

Some of these instances are remembered (as “facts”) and stored in the fact repository, FR, a knowledge base of remembered ontological instances. Some facts in the fact repository are referred to by proper names in texts–personal names, toponyms, names of organizations, specific artifacts (“the statue of Liberty”), etc. These proper names are stored in the onomasticon, the semantic zones of whose entries contain a pointer to a corresponding FR element.2 The following example illustrates our ontologicalsemantic knowledge resources (for a more detailed description see Nirenburg and Raskin 2003, Chapters 6- 7). The example is much simpler than the sentences from real texts with which the ontological-semantic analyzer typically works and is used here for pedagogical reasons and to save space. Consider the input sentence Alex Patrick makes tools.
