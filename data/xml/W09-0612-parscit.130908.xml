Alignment of interlocutors is a well known
psycholinguistic phenomenon of great rel-
evance for dialogue systems in general and
natural language generation in particular.
In this paper, we present the alignment-
capable microplanner SPUD prime. Us-
ing a priming-based model of interactive
alignment, it is flexible enough to model
the alignment behaviour of human speak-
ers to a high degree. This will allow for
further investigation of which parameters
are important to model alignment and how
the human–computer interaction changes
when the computer aligns to its users.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991065625">
A well known phenomenon in dialogue situations
is alignment of the interlocutors. An illustrative
example is given by Levelt and Kelter (1982), who
telephoned shops and either asked the question
“What time does your shop close?” or the ques-
tion “At what time does your shop close?”. The
answers were likely to mirror the form of the ques-
tion. When asked “At what ... ?”, answers tended
to begin with the preposition ‘at’ (e.g., “At five
o’clock.”). Conversely, when asked “What ... ?”,
answers tended to begin without the preposition
(e.g., “Five o’clock.”). Similar alignment phenom-
ena can be observed in many aspects of speech pro-
duction inter alia in syntactic and lexical choice.
Pickering and Garrod (2004) present the inter-
active alignment model bringing together all align-
ment phenomena of speech processing in dialogue.
According to this model, human language com-
prehension and production are greatly facilitated
by alignment of the interlocutors during conversa-
tion. The process of alignment is explained through
mutual priming of the interlocutors’ linguistic rep-
resentations. Thus, it is automatic, efficient, and
non-conscious. A stronger claim of the authors is
that alignment — in combination with routines and
a dialogue lexicon—is a prerequisite for fluent
speech production in humans.
Alignment effects also occur in human–com-
puter interaction. Brennan (1991) and Branigan
et al. (in press) present evidence that syntactic
structures and lexical items used by a computer
are subsequently adopted by users. For this reason,
alignment is an important concept for natural lan-
guage human–computer interaction in general, and
for dialogue systems with natural language gener-
ation in particular. Integrating ideas from the in-
teractive alignment model into the microplanning
component of natural language generation systems
should be beneficial for several reasons. First, mi-
croplanning may become more efficient since the
subsets of rules or lexical items in the dialogue
lexicon that have been used before can be prefer-
entially searched. Second, due to self-alignment,
the output of the system can become more con-
sistent and therefore easier to understand for the
user. Finally, mutual alignment of user and dia-
logue system might make the conversation itself
more natural and, presumably, cognitively more
lightweight for the user.
In this paper we present a computational model
for parts of the interactive alignment model that
are particularly important in the context of natural
language generation. We describe how this model
has been incorporated into the existing SPUD lite
system (Stone et al., 2003; Stone, 2002) to yield
the alignment-capable microplanner SPUD prime.
In Section 2 we describe previous approaches to
integrate alignment into natural language genera-
tion. In Sections 3 and 4, we present our priming-
based model of alignment and its implementation
in SPUD prime. In Section 5, we describe results
of an evaluation on a corpus of task-oriented dia-
logue, and in Section 6 we conclude our work and
describe possible future directions.

Computational modelling is an important method-
ology for evaluating and testing psycholinguistic
theories. Thus, it is certainly not a new idea to
implement the interactive alignment model compu-
tationally. Indeed, a call for “explicit computational
models” is made as early as in the open peer com-
mentary on Pickering and Garrod’s (2004) paper.
Brockmann et al. (2005) and Isard et al. (2006)
present a ‘massive over-generation’ approach to
modelling alignment and individuality in natural
language generation. Their system generates a
huge number of alternative sentences—up to
3000 —and evaluates each of these sentences with
a trigram model consisting of two parts: a default
language model computed from a large corpus and
a cache model which is calculated from the user’s
last utterance. The default language model is lin-
early interpolated with the cache model, whose in-
fluence on the resulting combined language model
is determined by a weighting factor X E [0,1] that
controls the amount of alignment the system exhib-
its.
Purver et al. (2006) take a more formal approach.
They use an implementation of the Dynamic Syn-
tax formalism, which uses the same representations
and mechanisms for parsing as well as for genera-
tion of natural language, and extend it with a model
of context. In their model, context consists of two
distinct representations: a record of the semantic
trees generated and parsed so far and a record of
the transformation actions used for the construction
of these semantic trees. Re-use of semantic trees
and actions is used to model many dialogue phe-
nomena in Dynamic Syntax and can also explain
alignment. Thus, the authors declare alignment to
be a corollary of context re-use. In particular, re-use
of actions is assumed to have a considerable influ-
ence on alignment in natural language generation.
Instead of looking through the complete lexicon
each time a lexical item is chosen, this kind of lex-
ical search is only necessary if no action—which
constructed the same meaning in the given con-
text before — exists in the record. If such an action
exists, it can simply be re-used, which obviously
leads to alignment.
A completely different approach to alignment
in natural language generation is presented by de
Jong et al. (2008), whose goal is to make a vir-
tual museum guide more believable by aligning
to the user’s level of politeness and formality. In
order to achieve this, the virtual guide analyses sev-
eral features of the user’s utterance and generates a
reply with the same level of politeness and formal-
ity. According to the authors, lexical and syntactic
alignment occur automatically because the lexical
items and syntactic constructions to choose from
are constrained by the linguistic style adopted.
Finally, Bateman (2006) advocates another pro-
posal according to which alignment in dialogue is
predictable for it is an inherently social activity.
Following the social-semiotic view of language,
Bateman suggests to model alignment as arising
from register and microregister. More specifically,
in his opinion priming of a linguistic representation
is comparable with pre-selecting a microregister
that must be considered when generating an utter-
ance in a particular social context.
The approaches presented above primarily focus
on the linguistic aspects of alignment in natural
language generation. The work of Brockmann et
al. (2005) and Isard et al. (2006) concentrates on
the surface form of language, Bateman (2006) sees
alignment arising from social-semiotic aspects, and
Purver et al. (2006) are primarily interested in fit-
ting alignment into a formal linguistic framework.
In this paper we adopt a more psycholinguistic and
cognitive stance on alignment. Pickering and Gar-
rod (2004) propose that low-level priming is the
basic mechanism underlying interactive alignment.
Here, we propose that computational modelling of
these priming mechanisms also opens up an inter-
esting and new perspective for alignment in natural
language generation.

3 A Priming-based Model of Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998780625">
We are interested here in those parts of the inter-
active alignment model that are most relevant for
microplanning in natural language generation and
it is out of our scope to model all the facets and
details of direct/repetition priming in the alignment
of linguistic representations. For instance, exact
timing effects are likely to be not even relevant as,
in an actual system, it does not matter how many
milliseconds faster the retrieval of a primed lexical
item is in contrast to the retrieval of an item that
is not primed. For this reason we adopt an ideal-
ised view, in which priming of linguistic structures
results from two basic activation mechanisms:
Temporary activation This kind of activation
should increase abruptly and then decrease
slowly over time until it reaches zero again.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997988">
83
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999195583333333">
Permanent activation This kind of activation
should increase by a certain quantity and then
maintain the new level.
These two mechanisms of priming are in ac-
cordance with empirical findings. Branigan et al.
(1999) present evidence for rapid decay of activa-
tion of primed syntactic structures, whereas Bock
and Griffin (2000) report evidence for their long(er)
term activation. In any case, Reitter (2008) found
both types of priming in his analysis of several
corpora, with temporary activation being the more
important one. The assumption that both mechan-
isms play a role in dialogue is also supported by
Brennan and Clark (1996) whose terminology will
be followed in this paper: temporary priming will
be called ‘recency of use effects’ and permanent
priming will be called ‘frequency of use effects’.
Reitter (2008) assumes the repetition probability
of primed syntactic structures to depend logarith-
mically on the distance between priming and usage.
Here, recency of use effects are modelled by a
more general exponential decay function, modified
to meet the needs for modelling activation decay of
primed structures:

<equation confidence="0.788208">
(1)
Or ∈ N+; α &gt; 0; ta ∈ [0,1]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819636363636">
ta(Or) is the temporary activation value of a lin-
guistic structure depending on the distance Or
between the current time T and the time r at which
the structure was primed. The slope of the function
is determined by the parameter α. Additionally, the
function is shifted right in order to yield an activa-
tion value of 1 for Or = 1. This shift is due to the
assumption of discrete time steps with a minimal
distance of 1. A plot of ta(Or) with different values
for α is given in Figure 1a.
Using exponential decay to model temporary ac-
tivation appears to be a sensible choice that is often
used to model natural processes. The advantage of
this model of temporary activation lies in its flexib-
ility. By changing the slope parameter α, different
empirical findings as well as variation among hu-
mans can be modelled easily.
Next, a mathematical model for frequency of use
effects is needed. To prevent that frequency effects
lead to an ever increasing activation value, a max-
imum activation level exists. This is also found in
Reitter’s (2008) corpus studies, which indicate that

the frequency effect is inversely connected to the
recency effect. Here, we model recency effects with
a general exponential saturation function, modified
to meet the requirements for modelling permanent
activation of linguistic structures:

The most important point to note here is that the
permanent activation value pa(f) is not a function
of time but a function of the frequency-counter f
attached to each linguistic structure. Whenever a
structure is primed, its counter is increased by the
value of 1. Again, the slope of the function is de-
termined by the parameter β and the function is

shifted right in order to get an activation value of
0 for f = 1. A plot of equation (2) with different
slope parameters is given in Figure 1b. Similar to
the advantages of the model of temporary activa-
tion, this model for frequency effects is very flex-
ible so that different empirical findings and human
individuality can be expressed easily.
Now, both priming models need to be combined
for a model of alignment. We opted for a weighted
linear combination of temporary and permanent
activation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990551">
ca(Δr, f) = v •ta(Δr) + (1− v) • pa(f), (3)
0 &lt; v &lt; 1; ca E [0,1]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839043478261">
Different values of v allow different forms of align-
ment. With a value of v = 0.5 recency and fre-
quency effects are equally important, with a value
of v = 1 alignment depends on recency only, and
with a value of v = 0 alignment is governed solely
by frequency. Being able to adjust the influence
of the different sorts of priming on alignment is
crucial as it has not yet been empirically determ-
ined to what extent recency and frequency of use
affect alignment (in Section 5.2 we will exploit this
flexibility for matching empircial data).
In contrast to the models of alignment presented
in Section 2, the computational alignment model
presented here will not only consider alignment
between the interlocutors (interpersonal- or other-
alignment), but also alignment to oneself (intra-
personal- or self-alignment). Pickering et al. (2003)
present results from three experiments which sug-
gest self-alignment to be even more important than
other-alignment. In our model, self-alignment is
accounted for with the same priming-based mech-
anisms. To this end, four counters are attached to
each linguistic structure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999915">
• Δrs: recency of use by the system itself
• Δro: recency of use by the interlocutor
• fs: frequency of use by the system itself
• fo: frequency of use by the interlocutor
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9198405">
The overall activation value of the structure is
a linear combination of the combined activation
value ca(Δrs, fs) and the combined activation value
ca(Δro, fo) from equation (3):

<equation confidence="0.677684">
0 &lt; X, µ &lt; 1; act E [0,1]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999525875">
Again, by changing the factor µ, smooth interpola-
tion between pure self-alignment (µ = 1) and pure
other-alignment (µ = 0) is possible, which can ac-
count for different empirical findings or human
individual differences. Furthermore, the strength
of alignment is modelled with a scaling factor X,
which determines whether alignment is considered
during generation (X &gt; 0) or not (X = 0).

4 The Alignment-capable Microplanner
SPUD prime
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992282051282">
The previously described priming-based model of
alignment has been implemented by extending
the integrated microplanning system SPUD lite
(Stone, 2002). SPUD lite is a lightweight Prolog
re-implementation of the SPUD microplanning sys-
tem (Stone et al., 2003) based on the context-free
tree rewriting grammar formalism TAGLET. Not
only the microplanner itself, but also the linguistic
structures (the initial TAGLET trees) are represen-
ted as Prolog clauses.
SPUD lite carries out the different microplan-
ning tasks (lexical choice, syntactic choice, refer-
ring expression generation and aggregation) at once
by treating microplanning as a search problem. Dur-
ing generation it tries to find an utterance which is
in accordance with the constraints set by its input
(a grammar, a knowledge base and a query). This is
done by searching the search space spanned by the
linguistic grammar rules and the knowledge base
until a goal state is found. Non-goal search states
are preliminary utterances that are extended by one
linguistic structure in each step until a syntactically
complete utterance is found which conveys all the
specified communicative goals. Since this search
space is large even for relatively small grammars,
a heuristic greedy search strategy is utilised.
Our alignment-capable microplanner SPUD
prime extends SPUD lite in several ways. First, we
altered the predicate for the initial TAGLET trees
by adding a unique identifier ID as well as counters
for self/other-recency/frequency values (rs, fs, ro
and fo; see Section 3). The activation value of an
initial tree is then calculated with equation (4).
Furthermore, we have created a mechanism that
enables SPUD lite to change the recency and fre-
quency information attached to the initial trees on-
line during generation. This is done in three steps
with the help of Prolog’s meta-programming cap-
abilities: Firstly, the clause of a tree is retrieved
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.983557333333333">

X � (µ � ca(Δrs, fs) + (1− µ) � ca(Δro, fo)),

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99846047826087">
from the knowledge base. Secondly, it is retrac-
ted from the knowledge base. Finally, the clause
is (re-)asserted in the knowledge base with up-
dated recency and frequency information. As a
welcome side effect of this procedure, primed ini-
tial trees are moved to the top of the knowledge
base and — since Prolog evaluates clauses and facts
in the order of their appearance in the knowledge
base—they can be accessed earlier than unprimed
initial trees or initial trees that were primed longer
ago. Thus, in SPUD prime recency of priming dir-
ectly influences the access of linguistic structures.
Most importantly, the activation values of the ini-
tial trees are considered during generation. Thus, in
addition to the evaluation measures used by SPUD
lite’s heuristic state evaluation function, the mean
activation value
of the N initial trees {t1,...,tN} of a given search
state S is taken into account as a further evaluation
measure. Hence, when SPUD prime evaluates (oth-
erwise equal) successor search states, the one with
the highest mean activation value is chosen as the
next current state.

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987977777778">
In order to find out whether our priming-based
alignment model and its implementation work as
intended, we evaluated SPUD prime on a corpus
that was collected in an experiment designed to
investigate the alignment behaviour of humans in
a controlled fashion (Weill et al., 2008). The part
of the corpus that we used consists of eight recor-
ded and transcribed dialogues between two inter-
locutors that play the ‘Jigsaw Map Game’, a task
in which different objects have to be placed cor-
rectly on a table. Speakers take turns in explaining
each other where to place the next object in re-
lation to the objects that are already on the table.
Each speaker has to learn a set of name–object rela-
tions before the game, such that both use the same
names for all but three objects. Due to this precon-
dition, both speakers use the same lexical referring
expressions for most objects and the speaker’s lex-
ical alignment behaviour for the differently named
objects can be observed easily.
In our evaluation, we concentrate on the gener-
ation of nouns by simulating the uses of the three
differently learned nouns in the eight dialogues
from the perspective of all sixteen interlocutors.
In each test, SPUD prime plays the role of one
of the speakers talking to a simulated interlocutor
who behaves exactly as in the real experiment.
With this test setup we examined, first, how well
SPUD prime can model the alignment behaviour
of a real speaker in a real dialogue context and,
second, whether our model is flexible enough to
consistently emulate different speakers with differ-
ent alignment behaviour.
In order to find the best model (i.e., the best
parameter set {α,β, µ,ν}) for each speaker, we
simulated all tests with all parameter combinations
and counted the number of mismatches between
our model’s choice and the real speaker’s choice.
To make this exhaustive search possible, we limit
the set of values for the parameters α and β to
{1,2,4,6,8,10,14,18,24,30} and the set of values
for the parameters µ and ν to {0,0.1,0.2,...,1},
resulting in a total of 112 × 102 = 12100 different
parameter sets. Since we want to investigate align-
ment, λ is constantly set to 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.997557941176471">
To illustrate our evaluation method, we first present
and discuss the simulation of one particular dia-
logue (from the Jigsaw Map Game corpus) from
the perspective of participant (A). Before the exper-
iment started, both interlocutors learned the name-
object relations ‘Raute’ (rhombus), ‘Ring’ (ring),
‘Schraube’ (bolt) and ‘W¨urfel’ (cube), additionally
participant (A) learned ‘Spielfigur’ (token), ‘Ball’
(sphere) and ‘Block’ (cuboid) and participant (B)
learned ‘M¨annchen’ (token), ‘Kugel’ (sphere) and
‘Klotz’ (cuboid). In our simulation, we focus on the
use of the differently learned names (the targets)
and not on the other names (non-targets). Table 1
shows the sequence of target nouns as they oc-
curred in the real dialogue (non-targets omitted).
For each parameter set {α,β,µ,ν} the dialogue
is simulated in the following way:

The evaluation measure for a specific parameter
set is the number of mismatches it produces when
simulating a dialogue. Thus the parameter set (or
rather sets) which produce the least number of mis-
matches are the ones that best model the particular
speaker under consideration. For participant (A)
of our example dialogue the distribution of para-
meter sets p producing m mismatches is shown in
Table 2. Four parameter sets produce only two mis-
matches (in phrase 15 and 22; cf. Table 1) and thus
our priming-based alignment model can account
for 92% of the target nouns produced by speaker
(A). However, it must be noted that these two mis-
matches occur at points in the dialogue where the
alignment behaviour of (A) is not straightforward.
At target noun 15, both interlocutors have already
used the name ‘Ball’ and then both switch to ‘Ku-
gel’. The mismatch at target 22 is a special case: (A)
used ‘Kugel’ and immediately corrected himself to
‘Ball’, the name he learned prior to the experiment.
It seems as if the task instruction, to use the learned
nouns, suddenly became prevalent.

5.2 Simulation Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897285714286">
To evaluate our alignment-capable microplanner,
we simulated the noun production for each of the
interlocutors from the experiment. One dialogue
has been excluded from the data analysis as the
dialogue partners used nouns that none of them had
learned in the priming phase. For each of the re-
maining 14 interlocutors we varied the parameters
a, /3, ,u and v as described above to identify those
parameter set(s) which result in the least number
of mismatches.
Each interlocutor produced between 18 and 32
target nouns (N=14, M=23.071, SD=3.936). Our
simulation runs contain between 0 and 19 mis-
matches overall (N=169400, M=6.35, SD=3.398).
The minimal number of mismatches for each
speaker simulation ranges between 0 and 6 (N=14,
M=2.286, SD=1.684). That is, our model can sim-
ulate a mean of 89.9% of all target nouns (N=14,
M=.899, Min=.667, Max=1.000, SD=.082), which
is an improvement of 24.6% on the baseline con-
dition (alignment switched off), where 65.3% of
the target nouns are generated correctly (N=14,
M=.653, Min=.360, Max=1.000, SD=.071). As
already illustrated in Section 5.1, mismatches typic-
ally occur at points in the dialogue where the align-
ment behaviour of the interlocutor is not straight-
forward.
As displayed in Table 3 the parameter assign-
ments resulting in least mismatches differ consid-
erably from speaker to speaker. However, there are
some remarkable trends to be observed in the data.
As concerns the parameter ,u, which determines
the combination of self- and other-alignment, the
majority of values are in the upper range of the
interval [0,1]. For 8 of 14 speakers the mean is
above 0.7 with relatively low standard deviations.
Only for one speaker (P13) the mean ,u is below
0.3. Thus, the parameter values indicate a consider-
able tendency toward self-alignment in contrast to
other-alignment.

recency and frequency effects of priming, the res-

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988627118644">
In this paper, we introduced a priming-based model
of alignment which focusses more on the psycho-
linguistic aspects of interactive alignment and mod-
els recency and frequency of use effects — as pro-
posed by Reitter (2008) and Brennan and Clark
(1996) — as well as the difference between intraper-
sonal and interpersonal alignment (Pickering et al.,
2003; Pickering and Garrod, 2004). The presented
model is fully parameterisable and can account for
different empirical findings and ‘personalities’. It
has been implemented in the SPUD prime micro-
planner which activates linguistic rules by changing
its knowledge base on-line and considers the ac-
tivation values of those rules used in constructing
the current utterance by using their mean activation
value as an additional feature in its state evaluation
function.
We evaluated our alignment model and its im-
plementation in SPUD prime on a corpus of task-
oriented dialogue collected in an experimental
setup especially designed for alignment research.
The results of this evaluation show that our priming-
based model of alignment is flexible enough to sim-
ulate the alignment behaviour of different human
speakers (generating target nouns) in the experi-
mental setting. It should be noted, however, that
our model tries to give a purely mechanistic ex-
planation of lexical and syntactic choice and that
it, therefore, cannot explain alignment phenomena
that are due to social factors (e.g., politeness, rela-
tionship, etc.), audience design or cases, in which a
speaker consciously decides whether to align or not
(e.g., whether to use a word or its synonym). While
the evaluation has shown that our model can repro-
duce human alignment behaviour to a high degree,
it remains to be investigated which influence each
parameter exerts and how exactly the parameters
vary across individual speakers.
Nevertheless, the development of the alignment-
capable microplanner is only one step in the dir-
ection of an intuitive natural language human–
computer interaction system. In order to reach this
goal, the next step is to combine SPUD prime with
a natural language understanding system, which
should ideally work with the same linguistic rep-
resentations so that the linguistic structures used
by the interlocutor could be primed automatically.
This work is underway.
Furthermore, user studies should be carried
out in order to evaluate SPUD prime in a more
sophisticated way. Branigan et al. (in press) found
that human–computer alignment was even stronger
than human–human alignment. But how would
the alignment behaviour of human interlocutors
change if the computer they are speaking to also
aligns to them? Further, would integration of an
alignment-capable dialogue system into a computer
interface make the interaction more natural? And
would an embodied conversational agent appear

presented here provides a starting point for the
investigation of these questions.

(2008), whose goal is to make a virtual museum guide more believable by aligning to the user’s level of politeness and formality. In order to achieve this, the virtual guide analyses several features of the user’s utterance and generates a reply with the same level of politeness and formality. According to the authors, lexical and syntactic alignment occur automatically because the lexical items and syntactic constructions to choose from are constrained by the linguistic style adopted. Finally, Bateman (2006) advocates another proposal according to which alignment in dialogue is predictable for it is an inherently social activity. Following the social-semiotic view of language, Bateman suggests to model alignment as arising from register and microregister.

According to this model, human language comprehension and production are greatly facilitated by alignment of the interlocutors during conversation. The process of alignment is explained through mutual priming of the interlocutors’ linguistic representations. Thus, it is automatic, efficient, and non-conscious. A stronger claim of the authors is that alignment — in combination with routines and a dialogue lexicon—is a prerequisite for fluent speech production in humans. Alignment effects also occur in human–computer interaction. Brennan (1991) and Branigan et al. (in press) present evidence that syntactic structures and lexical items used by a computer are subsequently adopted by users. For this reason, alignment is an important concept for natural language human–computer interaction in general, and for dialogue systems with natural language generation in particular. Integrating ideas from the interactive alignment model into the microplanning component of natural language generation systems should be beneficial for several reasons. First, microplanning may become more efficient since the subsets of rules or lexical items in the di</context>

Thus, it is certainly not a new idea to implement the interactive alignment model computationally. Indeed, a call for “explicit computational models” is made as early as in the open peer commentary on Pickering and Garrod’s (2004) paper. Brockmann et al. (2005) and Isard et al. (2006) present a ‘massive over-generation’ approach to modelling alignment and individuality in natural language generation. Their system generates a huge number of alternative sentences—up to 3000 —and evaluates each of these sentences with a trigram model consisting of two parts: a default language model computed from a large corpus and a cache model which is calculated from the user’s last utterance. The default language model is linearly interpolated with the cache model, whose influence on the resulting combined language model is determined by a weighting factor X E [0,1</context>

Thus, it is certainly not a new idea to implement the interactive alignment model computationally. Indeed, a call for “explicit computational models” is made as early as in the open peer commentary on Pickering and Garrod’s (2004) paper. Brockmann et al. (2005) and Isard et al. (2006) present a ‘massive over-generation’ approach to modelling alignment and individuality in natural language generation. Their system generates a huge number of alternative sentences—up to 3000 —and evaluates each of these sentences with a trigram model consisting of two parts: a default language model computed from a large corpus and a cache model which is calculated from the user’s last utterance. The default language model is linearly interpolated with the cache model, whose influence on the resulting combined language model is determined by a weighting factor X E [0,1] that controls the amou</context>

In this paper, we present the alignmentcapable microplanner SPUD prime. Using a priming-based model of interactive alignment, it is flexible enough to model the alignment behaviour of human speakers to a high degree. This will allow for further investigation of which parameters are important to model alignment and how the human–computer interaction changes when the computer aligns to its users. 1 Introduction A well known phenomenon in dialogue situations is alignment of the interlocutors. An illustrative example is given by Levelt and Kelter (1982), who telephoned shops and either asked the question “What time does your shop close?” or the question “At what time does your shop close?”. The answers were likely to mirror the form of the question. When asked “At what ... ?”, answers tended to begin with the preposition ‘at’ (e.g., “At five o’clock.”). Conversely, when asked “What ... ?”, answers tended to begin without the preposition (e.g., “Five o’clock.”). Similar alignment phenomena can be observed in many aspects of speech production inter alia in syntactic and lexical choice. Pickering and Garrod (2004) present the interactive alignm</context>

Pickering and Garrod (2004) present the interactive alignment model bringing together all alignment phenomena of speech processing in dialogue. According to this model, human language comprehension and production are greatly facilitated by alignment of the interlocutors during conversation. The process of alignment is explained through mutual priming of the interlocutors’ linguistic representations. Thus, it is automatic, efficient, and non-conscious. A stronger claim of the authors is that alignment — in combination with routines and a dialogue lexicon—is a prerequisite for fluent speech production in humans. Alignment</context>

Being able to adjust the influence of the different sorts of priming on alignment is crucial as it has not yet been empirically determined to what extent recency and frequency of use affect alignment (in Section 5.2 we will exploit this flexibility for matching empircial data). In contrast to the models of alignment presented in Section 2, the computational alignment model presented here will not only consider alignment between the interlocutors (interpersonal- or otheralignment), but also alignment to oneself (intrapersonal- or self-alignment). Pickering et al. (2003) present results from three experiments which suggest self-alignment to be even more important than other-alignment. In our model, self-alignment is accounted for with the same priming-based mechanisms. To this end, four counters are attached to each linguistic structure: • Δrs: recency of use by the system itself • Δro: recency of use by the interlocutor • fs: frequency of use by the system itself • fo: frequency of use by the interlocutor The overall activation value of the structure is a linear combination of the combined activation value ca(Δrs, fs) and the combined activation value ca(Δro</context>

In their model, context consists of two distinct representations: a record of the semantic trees generated and parsed so far and a record of the transformation actions used for the construction of these semantic trees.

These two mechanisms of priming are in accordance with empirical findings. Branigan et al. (1999) present evidence for rapid decay of activation of primed syntactic structures, whereas Bock and Griffin (2000) report evidence for their long(er) term activation. In any case, Reitter (2008) found both types of priming in his analysis of several corpora, with temporary activation being the more important one. The assumption that both mechanisms play a role in dialogue is also supported by Brennan and Clark (1996) whose terminology will be followed in this paper: temporary priming will be called ‘recency of use effects’ and permanent priming will be called ‘frequency of use effects’. Reitter (2008) assumes the repetition probability of primed syntactic structures to depend logarithmically on the distance between priming and usage.
