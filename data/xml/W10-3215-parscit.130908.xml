This study presents a novel computational
approach to the analysis of unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in Turkish by
employing feed-forward artificial neural
networks with a backpropagation algo-
rithm. The findings of the study reveal cor-
respondences between semantic notions
and syntactic manifestations of unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in this language,
thus presenting a computational analysis of
the distinction at the syntax/semantics in-
terface. The approach is applicable to other
languages, particularly the ones which lack
an explicit diagnostic such as auxiliary se-
lection but has a number of diagnostics in-
stead.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.983843516129032">
Ever since Unaccusativity Hypothesis (UH,
Perlmutter, 1978), it is widely recognized that
there are two heterogeneous subclasses of in-
transitive verbs, namely unaccusatives and un-
ergatives. The phenomenon of unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction is wide-ranging and
labeled in a variety of ways, including active,
split S, and split intransitivity (SI). (cf. Mithun,
1991).1
Studies dealing with SI are numerous and re-
cently, works taking auxiliary selection as the
basis of this syntactic phenomenon have in-
creased (cf. McFadden, 2007 and the references
therein). However, SI in languages that lack

interchangeably.
explicit syntactic manifestations such as auxil-
iary selection has been less studied.2 Computa-
tional approaches are even scarcer. The major
goal of this study is to discuss the linguistic is-
sues surrounding SI in Turkish and present a
novel computational approach that decides
which verbs are unaccusative and which verbs
are unergative in this language. The computa-
tional approach may in turn be used to study the
split in lesser-known languages, especially the
ones lacking a clear diagnostic. It may also be
used with well-known languages where the split
is observed as a means to confirm earlier predic-
tions made about SI.

2 Approaches to Split Intransitivity (SI)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880555555556">
Broadly speaking, approaches to the SI may be
syntactic or semantic. Syntactic approaches di-
vide intransitive verbs into two syntactically
distinct classes. According to the seminal work
of Perlmutter (1978), unaccusative and unerga-
tive verbs form two syntactically distinct classes
of intransitive verbs. Within the context of Rela-
tional Grammar, Perlmutter (1978) proposed
that unaccusative verbs have an underlying ob-
ject promoted to the subject position, while un-
ergative verbs have a base-generated subject.
This hypothesis, known as the Unaccusativity
Hypothesis (UH) maintains that the mapping of
the sole argument of an intransitive verb onto
syntax as subject or direct object is semantically
predictable. The UH distinguishes active or ac-
tivity clauses (i.e., unergative clauses) from un-
accusative ones. Unergative clauses include

willed or volitional acts (work, speak) and cer-
tain involuntary bodily process predicates
(cough, sleep); unaccusative clauses include
predicates whose initial term is semantically
patient (fall, die), predicates of existing and
happening (happen, vanish), nonvoluntary
emission predicates (smell, shine), aspectual
predicates (begin, cease), and duratives (remain,
survive).
From a Government and Binding perspective,
Burzio (1986) differentiates between two in-
transitive classes by the verbs’ theta-marking
properties. In unaccusative verbs (labeled ‘erga-
tives’), the sole argument is the same as the
deep structure object; in unergative verbs, the
sole argument is the same as the agent at the
surface. The configuration of the two intransi-
tive verb types may be represented simply as
follows:
Unergatives: NP [VP V] John ran.
Unaccusatives: [VP V NP] John fell.
In its original formulation, the UH claimed that
the determination of verbs as unaccusative or
unergative somehow correlated with their se-
mantics and since then, there has been so much
theoretical discussion about how strong this
connection is. It has also been noted that a strict
binary division is actually not tenable because
across languages, some verbs fail to behave
consistently with respect to certain diagnostics.
For example, it has been shown that, with stan-
dard diagnostics, certain verbs such as last, stink,
bleed, die, etc can be classified as unaccusative
in one language, unergative in a different lan-
guage (Rosen, 1984; Zaenen, 1988, among
many others). This situation is referred to as
unaccusativity mismatches. New proposals that
specifically focus on these problems have also
been made (e.g., Sorace, 2000, below).

2.1 The Connection of Syntax and Seman-
tics in SI
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999235228571429">
Following the initial theoretical discussions
about the connection between syntactic diagnos-
tics and their semantic underpinnings, various
semantic factors were suggested. These involve
directed change and internal/external causation
(Levin &amp; Rappaport-Hovav, 1995), inferable
eventual position or state (Lieber &amp; Baayen,
1997), telicity and controllability (Zaenen,
1993), and locomotion (see Randall, 2007;
Alexiadou et al., 2004, and, Aranovich, 2007,
and McFadden, 2007 for reviews). Some re-
searchers have suggested that syntax has no role
in SI. For example, van Valin (1990), focusing
on Italian, Georgian, and Achenese, proposed
that SI is best characterized in terms of Aksion-
sart and volitionality. Kishimoto (1996) sug-
gested that volitionality is the semantic parame-
ter that largely determines unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in Japanese.
Auxiliary selection is among the most reliable
syntactic diagnostics proposed for SI. This re-
fers to the auxiliary selection properties of lan-
guages that have two perfect auxiliaries corre-
sponding to be and have in English. In Romance
and Germanic languages such as Italian, Dutch,
German, and to a lesser extent French, the equi-
valents of be (essere, zijn, sein, etre) tend to be
selected by unaccusative predicates while the
equivalents of have (avere, haben, hebben,
avoir) tend to be selected by unergative predi-
cates (Burzio, 1986; Zaenen, 1993; Keller,
2000; Legendre, 2007, among others). In (1a–b)
the situation is illustrated in French (F), German
(G) and Italian (I). (Examples are from Legen-
dre, 2007).
</bodyText>

b. Maria est venue (F)/ist gekommen
(G)/e venuta (I).
‘Maria came.’
Van Valin (1990) and Zaenen (1993) discuss
auxiliary selection as a manifestation of the se-
mantic property of telicity. Hence in Dutch,
zijn-taking verbs are by and large telic, hebben-
taking verbs are atelic.
Impersonal passivization is another diagnostic
that seems applicable to a wide range of lan-
guages and used by a number of authors, e.g.
Perlmutter (1978), Hoekstra and Mulder (1990),
Keller (2000). This construction is predicted to
be grammatical with unergative clauses but not
with unaccusative clauses. Zaenen (1993) notes
that impersonal passivization is controlled by
the semantic notion of protagonist control in
Dutch; therefore incompatibility of examples
such as bleed with impersonal passivization is
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9990146875">
attributed to the fact that bleed is not a protago-
nist control verb. Levin and Rappaport-Hovav
(1995:141) take impersonal passivization as an
unaccusativity diagnostic but take its sensitivity
to protagonist control as a necessary but an in-
sufficient condition for unergative verbs to al-
low it. In other words, only unergative verbs
will be found in this construction, though not all
of them.
Refinements of the UH have also been pro-
posed. Most notably, Sorace (2000) argued that
the variation attested across languages (as well
as within the dialects of a single language) is
orderly, and that there are a number of cut-off
points to which verb classes can be sensitive.
Sorace’s work on (monadic) intransitive verbs
is built on variation in the perfective auxiliary
selection of verbs in Romance and Germanic
languages and called Auxiliary Selection Hier-
archy (ASH). She demonstrates that the varia-
tion is based on a hierarchy of thematic and as-
pectual specification of the verbs (viz., telicity
and agentivity) and that it is a function of the
position of a verb on the hierarchy. Verbs with a
high degree of aspectual and thematic specifica-
tion occupy the extreme ends; variable verbs
occupy the middle position, reflecting the de-
creasing degree of aspectual specification. Both
cross-dialectally and across languages, these
verbs may be used either with unaccusative or
unergative syntax.3 The ASH therefore is a de-
scriptive statement considering auxiliary selec-
tion as a property characterized by both syntax
and semantics, as originally viewed by the UH.
We now turn to Turkish, which lacks perfec-
tive auxiliaries. A number of other syntactic
diagnostics, reviewed below, have been pro-
posed but unlike auxiliaries in other languages,
these are not obligatory constructions in Turk-
ish. In addition, the semantic properties underly-
ing the proposed diagnostics have not been
studied extensively. Therefore, Turkish presents
a particular challenge for any study about SI.
3 The claim that the two notions of ASH lie within a single
dimensional hierarchy has been questioned by Randall
(2007). The ASH has also been criticized since it does not
explain the reason why a certain language shows the
pattern it does (McFadden, 2007).

One of the diagnostics is the ÐArAk construc-

the root verb plus the morpheme ÐArAk
(...zkaragšz, 1986). In a Turkish clause which
involves the verbal suffix ÐArAk, both the con-
troller (the complement verb) and the target (the
matrix verb) have to be either unaccusative or
unergative. In addition, both the controlled and
the target have to be the final (surface) subjects
of the clause. The examples below contain sen-
tences where both the controller and the target
verbs are unaccusative (2) or both are unerga-
tive (3). The examples also contain ungram-
matical sentences where the controller verb is
unergative whereas the target verb is unaccusa-
tive (4), and those in which the controller verb
is unaccusative whereas the target verb is
unergative (5). (Examples are from ...zkaragšz,

3.6 Impersonal Passivization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999316">
Impersonal passivization, used as a diagnostic
to single out unergatives by some researchers,
appears usable for Turkish as well. In Turkish,
impersonal passives carry the phonologically
conditioned passive suffix marker, -Il, accom-
panied by an indefinite human interpretation
and a resistance to agentive by-phrases. It has
been suggested that the tense in which the verb
appears affects the acceptability of impersonal
passives: when the verb is in the aorist, the im-
plicit subject has an arbitrary interpretation, i.e.
either a generic or existential interpretation. On
the other hand, in those cases when the verb is
in past tense, the implicit subject has a referen-
tial meaning, namely a first person plural read-
ing. It was therefore suggested that impersonal
passivization is a proper diagnostic environment
only in the past tense, which was also adopted
in the present study (Nakipoğlu-Demiralp,
2001, cf. Sezer, 1991). (17) and (18) exemplify

The diagnostics summarized above do not al-
ways pick out the same verbs in Turkish. For
example, most diagnostics will fare well with
the verbs düş- ‘fall’, gel- ‘come’, gir- ‘enter’
(with a human subject) just as well as imper-
sonal passivization. In other words, these verbs
are unaccusative according to most diagnostics
and unergative according to impersonal
passivization. The opposite of this situation also
holds. The stative verb devam et- ‘continue’ is
bad or marginally acceptable with most
diagnostics as well as impersonal passivization.
The conclusion is that in Turkish, acceptabil-
ity judgments with the proposed diagnostic en-
vironments do not yield a clear distinction be-
tween unaccusative and unergative verbs. In
addition, it is not clear which semantic proper-
ties these diagnostics are correlated with. The
model described below is expected to provide
some answers to these issues. It is based on na-
tive speaker judgments but it goes beyond them
by computationally showing that there are cor-
respondences between semantic notions and
syntactic manifestations of SI in Turkish. The
model is presented below.

4.1 Artificial Neural Networks and Learn-
ing Paradigms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987310344828">
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a compu-
tational model that can be used as a non-linear
statistical data modeling tool. ANNs are gener-
ally used for deriving a function from observa-
tions, in applications where the data are com-
plex and it is difficult to devise a relationship
between observations and outputs by hand.
ANNs are characterized by interconnected
group of artificial neurons, namely nodes. An
ANN generally has three major layers of nodes:
a single input layer, a single or multiple hidden
layers, and a single output layer. In a feedfor-
ward ANN, the outputs from all the nodes go to
succeeding but not preceding layers.
There are three major learning paradigms that
are used for training ANNs: supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learn-
ing. A backpropagation algorithm is a super-
vised learning method which is used for teach-
ing a neural network how to perform a specific
task. Accordingly, a feed-forward ANN with a
backpropagation algorithm is a computational
tool that models the relationship between obser-
vations and output by employing supervised
learning method (see Hertz et al., 1991; Ander-
son &amp; Rosenfeld, 1988, among many others for
ANNs). The following section presents how
such an ANN is used for analyzing unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in Turkish.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995611">
4.2 The Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952153846154">
Two feed-forward ANNs with a backpropaga-
tion algorithm were developed for the analysis.
Both models had a single input layer, a single
hidden layer, and a single output layer of nodes.
Both models had a single output node, which
represents the binary status of a given verb as
unaccusative (0) or unergative (1). The number
of nodes in the hidden layer was variable (see
below for a discussion of network parameters).
The difference between the two models was
the design of the input layer. The first model
(henceforth, the diagnostics model DIAG) took
diagnostics as input nodes, whereas the second
model (henceforth, the semantic parameters
model SEMANP) took semantic parameters as
input nodes, as presented in detail below.
The Diagnostics Model (DIAG): Binary ac-
ceptability values of the phrases or sentences
formed by the syntactic diagnostics constituted
the input nodes for the network (see above for
the SI diagnostics). Each syntactic diagnostic
provided a binary value (either 0 or 1) to one of
the input nodes. For example, consider the –mIş
participle as one of the syntactic diagnostics for
SI in Turkish. As discussed above, the –mIş par-
ticiple forms acceptable adjectival phrases with
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998035">

<bodyText confidence="0.943287388888889">
unaccusative verbs (e.g., sol- ‘wilt’) but not
with the unergative verbs (e.g., sõgra- ‘jump,
leap’), as shown in (19) and (20) below.
(19) sol-muş gigek-ler
wilt-mIş flower-PLU
‘wilted flowers’
(20) *sõgra-mõş sporcu-lar
jump-mIş sportsman-PLU
‘jumped sportsmen’
Accordingly, for the verb sol- ‘wilt’, the –mIş
participle diagnostic provides the value 1 with
one of the input nodes, whereas for the verb
sõgra- ‘jump, leap’ it provides the value 0 with
the corresponding input node. In this way, the
syntactic diagnostics constituted an input pat-
tern with eight members for each verb.5 The
construction of an input pattern is exemplified
in (21) for the unergative verb konuş- ‘talk’.

5 One of the syntactic diagnostics (the gerund suffix
–ArAk ) involves two verbs (i.e., the target and the matrix
verb). Therefore, two sentences/phrases were formed–one
with unaccusatives and the other with unergatives–which
provided two binary values with the input pattern.
Accordingly, the input pattern for the verb
konuş- ‘talk’ is schematically shown below.
The Semantic Parameters Model (SE-
MANP): The input nodes for the SEMANP
network were constituted by four binary values
that represented the status of four semantic pa-
rameters (telicity, volitionality, dynamicity, and
directed motion) for each verb. Each semantic
parameter provided a binary value (either 0 or 1)
to one of the input nodes. The value of the input
nodes were determined by applying the follow-
ing tests for the relevant semantic aspects: (1)
in/for an hour test for telicity (e.g. the phrase to
talk *in/for an hour shows that the verb talk is
atelic whereas the phrase to wilt in/*for an hour
shows that the verb wilt is telic), (2) on purpose
test for volitionality, (3) hala- ‘still’ test for dy-
namicity, (4) and the dative test (i.e., acceptabil-
ity of adding a dative term to the verb) for di-
rected motion.
The construction of an input pattern for SE-
MANP is exemplified in (22) for the unaccusa-
tive verb sol- ‘wilt’.

The distribution of weights after the training

participle is the most reliable diagnostics for
analyzing unaccusative/unergative distinction in
Turkish.

The number of hidden units: The number of
hidden layers was set to 1 as a non-variable de-

ber of hidden units was set to 3. Keeping the
learning rate (il=-0.25) and the momentum term
(λ=0.25) constant, the number of hidden units

A major finding of the suggested model is that
the predictions of the two models are compati-
ble with the UH (Perlmutter, 1978) in that they
divide most intransitive verbs into two, as ex-
pected. Furthermore, the differences between
the decisions of the diagnostics-based DIAG
model and the semantic-parameters-based
SEMANP model reflect a reported finding in
the unaccusativity literature, i.e., the tests used
to differentiate between unaccusatives and
unergatives do not uniformly delegate all verbs
to the same classes (the solution of why such
mismatches occur in Turkish is beyond the
scope of this study, see Sorace, 2000; Randall,
2007, for some suggestions). More specifically,
the three Group-A verbs that were predicted as
unaccusative by the DIAG model and unerga-
tive by the SEMANP model (dur- ‘remain, stay’,
kal- ‘stall, stay, and varol- ‘exist’) are stative
verbs, which are known to show inconsistent
behavior in the literature and classified as vari-
able-behavior verbs by Sorace (2000). An un-
expected finding is the Group-B verb (yüz-
‘swim’), which is predicted as unergative by the
DIAG model and unaccusative by the SEMANP
model. This seems to reflect the role of seman-
tic parameters other than telicity (namely, dy-
namicity and directed motion) in Turkish. The
remaining nine verbs of thirteen tested verbs
were predicted to be of the same type (either
unaccusative or unergative) by both models.
Another finding of the model is the alignment
between the most weighted syntactic diagnos-
tics for unaccusative/unergative distinction in
Turkish, namely the –mIş participle which re-
ceived the highest weight after the training, and
the most weighted semantic parameter, namely
telicity.

7 Conclusion and Future Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965181818182">
This study contributes to our understanding of
the distinction in several respects.
Firstly, it proposes a novel computational ap-
proach that tackles the unaccusative/unergative
distinction in Turkish. The model confirms that
a split between unaccusative and unergative
verbs indeed exists in Turkish but that the divi-
sion is not clear-cut. The model suggests that
certain verbs (e.g., stative verbs) behave incon-
sistently, as mentioned in most accounts in the
literature. Moreover, the model reflects a corre-
spondence between syntactic diagnostics and
semantics, which supports the view that unaccu-
sativity is semantically determined and syntacti-
cally manifested (Permutter, 1978, Levin &amp;
Rappaport-Hovav, 1995). Since this approach
uses relevant language-dependent features, it is
particularly applicable to languages that lack
explicit syntactic diagnostics of SI.
The computational approach is based on the
connectionist paradigm which employs feed-
forward artificial neural networks with a back-
propagation algorithm. There are several dimen-
sions in which the model will further be devel-
oped. First, the reliability of input node values
will be strengthened by conducting acceptability
judgment experiments with native speakers, and
the training of the model will be improved by
increasing the number of verbs used for training.
Acceptability judgments are influenced not only
by verbs but also by other constituents in
clauses or sentences; therefore the input data
will be improved to involve different senses of
verbs under various sentential constructions.
Second, alternative classifiers, such as decision
trees and naïve Bayes, as well as the classifiers
that use discretized weights may provide more
informative accounts of the findings of SI in
Turkish. These alternatives will be investigated
in further studies.

New proposals that specifically focus on these problems have also been made (e.g., Sorace, 2000, below). 2.1 The Connection of Syntax and Semantics in SI Following the initial theoretical discussions about the connection between syntactic diagnostics and their semantic underpinnings, various semantic factors were suggested. These involve directed change and internal/external causation (Levin &amp; Rappaport-Hovav, 1995), inferable eventual position or state (Lieber &amp; Baayen, 1997), telicity and controllability (Zaenen, 1993), and locomotion (see Randall, 2007; Alexiadou et al., 2004, and, Aranovich, 2007, and McFadden, 2007 for reviews). Some researchers have suggested that syntax has no role in SI. For example, van Valin (1990), focusing on Italian, Georgian, and Achenese, proposed that SI is best characterized in terms of Aksionsart and volitionality. Kishimoto (1996) suggested that volitionality is the semantic parameter that largely determines unaccusative/unergative distinction in Japanese. Auxiliary selection is among the most reliable syntactic diagnostics proposed for SI.

From a Government and Binding perspective, Burzio (1986) differentiates between two intransitive classes by the verbs’ theta-marking properties. In unaccusative verbs (labeled ‘ergatives’), the sole argument is the same as the deep structure object; in unergative verbs, the sole argument is the same as the agent at the surface. The configuration of the two intransitive verb types may be represented simply as follows: Unergatives: NP [VP V] John ran. Unaccusatives: [VP V NP] John fell.

Auxiliary selection is among the most reliable syntactic diagnostics proposed for SI. This refers to the auxiliary selection properties of languages that have two perfect auxiliaries corresponding to be and have in English. In Romance and Germanic languages such as Italian, Dutch, German, and to a lesser extent French, the equivalents of be (essere, zijn, sein, etre) tend to be selected by unaccusative predicates while the equivalents of have (avere, haben, hebben, avoir) tend to be selected by unergative predicates (Burzio, 1986; Zaenen, 1993; Keller, 2000; Legendre, 2007, among others).

In other words, only unergative verbs will be found in this construction, though not all of them. Refinements of the UH have also been proposed. Most notably, Sorace (2000) argued that the variation attested across languages (as well as within the dialects of a single language) is orderly, and that there are a number of cut-off points to which verb classes can be sensitive.

Firstly, it proposes a novel computational approach that tackles the unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish. The model confirms that a split between unaccusative and unergative verbs indeed exists in Turkish but that the division is not clear-cut. The model suggests that certain verbs (e.g., stative verbs) behave inconsistently, as mentioned in most accounts in the literature. Moreover, the model reflects a correspondence between syntactic diagnostics and semantics, which supports the view that unaccusativity is semantically determined and syntactically manifested (Permutter, 1978, Levin &amp; Rappaport-Hovav, 1995). Since this approach uses relevant language-dependent features, it is particularly applicable to languages that lack explicit syntactic diagnostics of SI. The computational approach is based on the connectionist paradigm which employs feedforward artificial neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. There are several dimensions in which the model will further be developed. First, the reliability of input node values will be strengthened by conducting acceptability judgment experiments with native speakers, and the training of the model will be improved by increasing the number of verbs</context>

A number of other syntactic diagnostics, reviewed below, have been proposed but unlike auxiliaries in other languages, these are not obligatory constructions in Turkish. In addition, the semantic properties underlying the proposed diagnostics have not been studied extensively. Therefore, Turkish presents a particular challenge for any study about SI. 3 The claim that the two notions of ASH lie within a single dimensional hierarchy has been questioned by Randall (2007). The ASH has also been criticized since it does not explain the reason why a certain language shows the pattern it does (McFadden, 2007). 3 Diagnostics for SI in Turkish Just as other languages, intransitive verbs in Turkish are sensitive to a set of syntactic environments, summarized below. 3.1 The ÐArAk Construction One of the diagnostics is the ÐArAk construction, which is an adverbial clause formed with the root verb plus the morpheme ÐArAk (...zkaragšz, 1986). In a Turkish clause which involves the verbal suffix ÐArAk, both the controller (the complement verb) and the target (the matrix verb) have to be either unaccusative or unergative.

It has been suggested that the tense in which the verb appears affects the acceptability of impersonal passives: when the verb is in the aorist, the implicit subject has an arbitrary interpretation, i.e. either a generic or existential interpretation. On the other hand, in those cases when the verb is in past tense, the implicit subject has a referential meaning, namely a first person plural reading. It was therefore suggested that impersonal passivization is a proper diagnostic environment only in the past tense, which was also adopted in the present study (Nakipoğlu-Demiralp, 2001, cf.

Syntactic approaches divide intransitive verbs into two syntactically distinct classes. According to the seminal work of Perlmutter (1978), unaccusative and unergative verbs form two syntactically distinct classes of intransitive verbs. Within the context of Relational Grammar, Perlmutter (1978) proposed that unaccusative verbs have an underlying object promoted to the subject position, while unergative verbs have a base-generated subject. This hypothesis, known as the Unaccusativity Hypothesis (UH) maintains that the mapping of the sole argument of an intransitive verb onto syntax as subject or direct object is semantically predictable. The UH distinguishes active or activity clauses (i.e., unergative clauses) from unaccusative</context>

(Examples are from Legendre, 2007). (1) a. Maria a travaille (F)/hat gearbeitet (G)/ha lavorato (I). ‘Maria worked.’ b. Maria est venue (F)/ist gekommen (G)/e venuta (I). ‘Maria came.’ Van Valin (1990) and Zaenen (1993) discuss auxiliary selection as a manifestation of the semantic property of telicity. Hence in Dutch, zijn-taking verbs are by and large telic, hebbentaking verbs are atelic. Impersonal passivization is another diagnostic that seems applicable to a wide range of languages and used by a number of authors, e.g. Perlmutter (1978), Hoekstra and Mulder (1990), Keller (2000). This construction is predicted to be grammatical with unergative clauses but not with unaccusative clauses. Zaenen (1993) notes that impersonal passivization is controlled by the semantic notion of protagonist control in Dutch; therefore incompatibility of examples such as bleed with impersonal passivization is 112 attributed to the fact that bleed is not a protagonist control verb.

The momentum term: The momentum term was set to X=0.25 initially. Keeping the number of hidden units (hidden_size=3) and the learning rate (il=-0.25) constant, adjusting the momentum term between X=0.01 and X=1.0 did not have an effect on the results. However, the system did not converge to a solution for the momentum term equal to and greater than X=1.0. 6 Discussion A major finding of the suggested model is that the predictions of the two models are compatible with the UH (Perlmutter, 1978) in that they divide most intransitive verbs into two, as expected. Furthermore, the differences between the decisions of the diagnostics-based DIAG model and the semantic-parameters-based SEMANP model reflect a reported finding in the unaccusativity literature, i.e., the tests used to differentiate between unaccusatives and unergatives do not uniformly delegate all verbs to the same classes (the solution of why such mismatches occur in Turkish is beyond the scope of this study, see Sorace, 2000; Randall, 2007, for some suggestions).

These involve directed change and internal/external causation (Levin &amp; Rappaport-Hovav, 1995), inferable eventual position or state (Lieber &amp; Baayen, 1997), telicity and controllability (Zaenen, 1993), and locomotion (see Randall, 2007; Alexiadou et al., 2004, and, Aranovich, 2007, and McFadden, 2007 for reviews). Some researchers have suggested that syntax has no role in SI. For example, van Valin (1990), focusing on Italian, Georgian, and Achenese, proposed that SI is best characterized in terms of Aksionsart and volitionality.

We now turn to Turkish, which lacks perfective auxiliaries. A number of other syntactic diagnostics, reviewed below, have been proposed but unlike auxiliaries in other languages, these are not obligatory constructions in Turkish. In addition, the semantic properties underlying the proposed diagnostics have not been studied extensively. Therefore, Turkish presents a particular challenge for any study about SI. 3 The claim that the two notions of ASH lie within a single dimensional hierarchy has been questioned by Randall (2007). The ASH has also been criticized since it does not explain the reason why a certain language shows the pattern it does (McFadden, 2007). 3 Diagnostics for SI in Turkish Just as other languages, intransitive verbs in Turkish are sensitive to a set of syntactic environments, summarized below. 3.1 The ÐArAk Construction One of the diagnostics is the ÐArAk construction, which is an adverbial clause formed with the root verb plus the morpheme ÐArAk (...zkaragšz, 1986). In a Turkish clause which involves the verbal suffix ÐArAk, both the controller (the complement verb) and the target (the matrix </context>

More specifically, the three Group-A verbs that were predicted as unaccusative by the DIAG model and unergative by the SEMANP model (dur- ‘remain, stay’, kal- ‘stall, stay, and varol- ‘exist’) are stative verbs, which are known to show inconsistent behavior in the literature and classified as variable-behavior verbs by Sorace (2000). An unexpected finding is the Group-B verb (yüz‘swim’), which is predicted as unergative by the DIAG model and unaccusative by the SEMANP model.

It has been suggested that the tense in which the verb appears affects the acceptability of impersonal passives: when the verb is in the aorist, the implicit subject has an arbitrary interpretation, i.e. either a generic or existential interpretation. On the other hand, in those cases when the verb is in past tense, the implicit subject has a referential meaning, namely a first person plural reading. It was therefore suggested that impersonal passivization is a proper diagnostic environment only in the past tense, which was also adopted in the present study (Nakipoğlu-Demiralp, 2001, cf. Sezer, 1991). (17) and (18) exemplify 114 impersonal passivization with the verb in the past tense. (17) Burada koşuldu.

In other words, these verbs are unaccusative according to most diagnostic</context>

Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (1995:141) take impersonal passivization as an unaccusativity diagnostic but take its sensitivity to protagonist control as a necessary but an insufficient condition for unergative verbs to allow it. In other words, only unergative verbs will be found in this construction, though not all of them. Refinements of the UH have also been proposed. Most notably, Sorace (2000) argued that the variation attested across languages (as well as within the dialects of a single language) is orderly, and that there are a number of cut-off points to which verb classes can be sensitive. Sorace’s work on (monadic) intransitive verbs is built on variation in the perfective auxiliary selection of verbs in Romance and Germanic languages and called Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy (ASH). She demonstrates that the variation is based on a hierarchy of thematic and aspectual specification of the verbs (viz., telicity and agentivity) and that it is a function of the position of a verb o</context>

As a result, a total of 104 input patterns, each composed of eight nodes, were used to train the DIAG model and 104 input patterns, each composed of four nodes, were used to train the SEMANP model.
