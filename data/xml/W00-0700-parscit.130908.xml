Fourth Conference on
Computational Natural Language Learning
(CoNLL-2000)
Preface
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.995045625">
CoNLL-2000 is the fourth in a series of meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL&apos;s SIG on Natural
Language Learning. Previous meetings were organized in Madrid, Sydney, and Bergen, co-located with
different, but always computational linguistics-oriented, events. We are pleased that this time we could
combine efforts with the grammar induction and inductive logic programming for language processing
communities.
It is the explicit wish of the SIGNLL board to have the CoNLL meeting address all aspects of computational
natural language learning, including issues that are not regularly discussed at computational linguistics
meetings, such as computational models of human language acquisition, computational models of the origins
and evolution of language, biologically-inspired learning methods, etc.
We are thrilled by the quality and quantity of the submissions, which allowed us to set up an intense
but rewarding program with one invited talk, 12 long talks, and joint paper sessions with LLL-2000 and
ICGI-2000. On top of that, we introduced two innovations: there are 12 bullet presentations, short talks
accompanied by a poster presentation, and a shared task session in which 11 authors report on how their
machine learning method performed on our shared task — the identification of syntactic constituents in
text (chunking). In this part of the proceedings, you will find 37 papers providing a useful record of all
presentations.

Second Learning Language in Logic Workshop
(LLL-2000)
Preface
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.992389294117647">
LLL-2000 is the follow-up of the first LLL workshop held in 1999 in Bled (Slovenia), and co-located with
the International Conference on Machine Learning and the International Conference on Logic Programming.
This year LLL was integrated with the Fourth Conference on Language Learning (CoNLL) and the
Fifth International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference (ICGI) with which LLL shares strong common
scientific interests in language learning. The registration to ICGI, CoNLL and LLL was a joint registration
so that registrants could freely move between the three events.
As in the first edition, LLL has attracted pluridisciplinary submissions from the three research fields
— Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Computational Logic, demonstrating the
growing interest in NLP methods based on ILP or non-classic logics, and hybrid methods. Relational
learning more and more appears as complementary to data analysis in many NLP domains. Relational
learning and logic-based learning prove here again their capacity to learn complex structured linguistic
resources and knowledge such as ontology and grammar from corpora and explicit background knowledge.
The scientific program of LLL-2000 consisted of one invited talk by Jorg-Uwe Kietz on the acquisition of
ontology and seven paper presentations. Six of them are reported here and the paper by Christophe Costa
Florencio, accepted for presentation by both LLL and ICGI, has been published in the ICGI proceedings.
The joint sessions with ICGI and CoNLL included one invited talk by Dan Roth and paper and poster
presentations.
