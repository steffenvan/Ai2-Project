ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999982583333333">
A formalism will be presented in this
paper which makes it possible to realise the
idea of assigning only one scope-ambiguous
representation to a sentence that is ambiguous
with regard to quantifier scope. The scope
determination results in extending this
representation with additional context and
world knowledge conditions. If there is no
scope determining information, the formalism
can work further with this scope-ambiguous
representation. Thus scope information does
not have to be completely determined.

Many natural language sentences have
more than one possible reading with regard to
quantifier scope. The• most widely used
methods for scope determination generate all
possible readings of a sentence with regard to
quantifier scope by applying all quantifiers
which occur in the sentence in all
combinatorically possible sequences. These
methods do not make use of the inner structure
and meaning of a quantifier. At best,
quantifiers are constrained by external
conditions in order to eliminate some scope
relations. The best known methods are:
determination of scope in LF in GB (May 1985),
Cooper Storage (Cooper 1983, Keller 1988) and
the algorithm of Hobbs and Shieber
(Hobbs/Shieber 1987). These methods assign,
for instance, six possible readings to a sentence
with three quantifiers. Using these methods, a
sentence must be disambiguated in order to
receive a semantic representation. This means
that a scope-ambiguous sentence necessarily
has several semantic representations, since the
formalisms for the representation do not allow
for scope-ambiguity.
It is hard to imagine that human beings
disambiguate scope-ambiguous sentences in the
same way. The generation of all possible
combinations of sequences of quantifiers and
the assignment of these sequences to various
readings seems to be cognitively inadequate.
The problem becomes even more complicated
when natural language quantifiers can be
interpreted distributively as well as
collectively, which can also lead to further
readings. Let us take the following sentence
from Kempson/Cormack (1981) as an example:
Two examiners marked six scripts.
The two quantifying noun phrases can in
this case be interpreted either distributively
or collectively. The quantifier two examiners
can have wide scope over the quantifier six
scripts, or vice versa, which all in all can lead
to various readings. Kempson and Cormack
assign four possible readings to this sentence,

Davies (1989) even eight. (A detailed
discussion will follow.) No one, however, will
make the claim that people will first assign
all possible representations with regard to the
scope of the quantifiers and their distribution,
and will then eliminate certain
interpretations according to the context; but
this is today&apos;s standard procedure in
linguistics. In many cases, it is also almost
impossible to determine a preferred reading.
The difficulties that people have when they
are forced to disambiguate such sentences (to
explicate all possible readings) point to the
fact that people only assign an under-
determined scope-ambiguous representation in
the first place.
Such a representation of the example
sentence would only contain the information
that we are dealing with a marking-relation
between examiners and scripts, and that we
are always dealing with two examiners and
six scripts. This representation does not contain
any information about scope. On the basis of
this representation one may in a given context
derive a representation with a determined
scope. But it may also be the case that this
information is sufficient in order to understand
the sentence if no scope-defining information is
given in the context, since in many cases human
beings do not disambiguate such sentences at
all. They use underdetermined, scopeless
interpretations, because their knowledge often
need not be so precise. If a disambiguation is
carried out, then this process is done in a very
natural way on the basis of context and world
knowledge. This points to the assumption that
scope determination by human beings is
performed on a semantic level and is deduced
on the basis of acquired knowledge.
I will present a formalism which works in
a similar way. This formalism will also show
that it is not necessary to work with many
sequences of quantifiers in order to determine
the various readings of a sentence with regard
to quantifier scope.
Within this formalism it is possible to
represent an ambiguous sentence with an
ambiguous representation which need not be
disambiguated, but can be disambiguated at a
later stage. The readings can either be
specified more clearly by giving additional
conditions, or they can be deduced from the
basic ambiguous reading by inference. Here,
the inner structure and the meaning of
quantifiers play an important role. The process
of disambiguation can only be performed when
additional information that restricts the
number of possible readings is available. As an
example of such information, I will treat
anaphoric relations.
Intuitively speaking, the difference
between assigning an undertermined
representation to an ambiguous sentence and
assigning a disjunction of all possible readings
to this sentence corresponds to the difference
between the following statements*:
&amp;quot;Peter owns between 150 and 200 books.&amp;quot;
and
&amp;quot;Peter owns 150 or 151 or 152 or ... or 200 books.&amp;quot;
It goes without saying that both
statements are equivalent, since we can
understand &amp;quot;150 or 151 or ... or 200&amp;quot; as a precise
specification of &amp;quot;between 150 and 200&amp;quot;.
Nevertheless, there are procedural differences
in processing the two pieces of information;
and there are cognitive differences for human
beings, since we would never explicitly utter
the second sentence. If we could represent
&amp;quot;between 150 and 200&amp;quot; directly by a simple
formula and not by giving a disjunction of 51
elements, then we may certainly gain great
procedural and representational advantages.
The deduction of readings in semantics does
not of course exclude a consideration of
syntactic restrictions. They can be imported
into the semantics, for example by passing
syntactic information with special indices, as

corresponding notation of second-order logic). I
choose this notation because it points to the
semantic content of the formulas and is thus
more intuitive.
described in Latecki (1991). Nevertheless, in
this paper I will abstain from taking syntactic
restrictions into consideration.

1. SCOPE-AMBIGUOUS
REPRESENTATION AND SCOPE
DETERMINATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999202">
The aims of the representation presented
in this paper are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8987681">
1. Assigning an ambiguous semantic
representation to an ambiguous sentence (with
regard to quantifier scope and distributivity),
from which further readings can later be
inferred.
2. The connections between the subject and
objects of a sentence are explicitly represented
by relations. The quantifiers (noun phrases)
constitute restrictions on the domains of these
relations.
3. Natural language sentences have more
than one reading with regard to quantifier
scope (and distributivity), but these readings
are not independent of one another. The target
representation makes the logical dependencies
of the readings easily discernible.
4. The construction of complex discourse
referents for anaphoric processes requires the
construction of complex sums of existing
discourse referents. In conventional
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9119425">
approaches, this can lead to a combinatorical
explosion (cf. Eschenbach et al. 1989 and 1990).
In the representation which is presented here,
the discourse referents are immediately
available as domains of the relations.
Therefore, we need not construe any complex
discourse referents. Sometimes we have to
specify a discourse referent in more detail,
which in turn can lead to a reduction in the
number of possible readings.
I now present the formalism.
The representational language used here is
second-order predicate logic. However, I will
mainly use set-theoretical notation (which
can be seen as an abbreviation of the
Let R ç XxY be a relation, that means, a
sub-set of the product of the two sets X and Y.
The domains of R will be called Dom R and
Range R, with
Dom R.(xE X: 3yE Y R(x,y)) and
Range R=(ye Y: 3xE X R(x,y)).
I make the explicit assumption here that
all relations are not empty. (This assumption
only serves in this paper to make the examples
simpler.)
In the formalism, a verb is represented by a
relation whose domain is defined by the
arguments of verbs. Determiners constitute
restrictions on the domains of the relation.
These restrictions correspond to the role of
determiners in Barwise&apos;s and Cooper&apos;s theory
of generalized quantifiers (Barwise and
Cooper 1981). This means for the following
sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.656943">
(1.1) Every boy saw a movie.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9706552">
that there is a relation of seeing between boys
and movies.
In the formal notation of second-order logic
we can describe this piece of information as
follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999642">
(1.1.a) 3X2 (Vxy (X2(x,y) Saw(x,y) &amp;
Boy(x) &amp; Movie(y) ))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995927375">
X2 is a second-order variable over the
domain of the binary predicates; and Saw,
Boy, and Movie are second-order constants
which represent a general relation of seeing,
the set of all boys, and the set of all movies,
respectively. We will abbreviate the above
formula by the following set-theoretical
formula:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991224">
243
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990510516129032">
(1.1.b) 3saw (saw g Boy x Movie)
In this formula, we view saw as a sorted
variable of the sort of the binary seeing-
relations. The variable saw corresponds to the
variable X2 in (1.1.a).
(1.1.b) describes an incomplete semantic
representation of sentence (1.1). Part of the
certain knowledge that does not determine
scope in the case of sentence (1.1) is also the
information that all boys are involved in the
relation, which is easily describable as:
Dom saw=Boy. We obtain this information
from the denotation of the determiner every.
In this way we have arrived at the scope-
ambiguous representation of (1.1):
(1.1.c) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie &amp;
Dom saw=Boy)
It may be that the information presented
in (1.1.c) is sufficient for the interpretation of
sentence (1.1). A precise determination of
quantifier scope need not be important at all,
since it may be irrelevant whether each boy
saw a different movie (which corresponds to
the wide scope of the universal quantifier) or
whether all boys saw the same movie (which
corresponds to the wide scope of the
existential quantifier).
Classic procedures will in this case
immediately generate two readings with
definite scope relations, whose notations in
predicate logic are given below.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3863865">
(1.2.a) Vx(boy(x) —&gt; 3y(movie(y) &amp; saw(x,y)))
(1.2.b) 3y(movie(y) &amp; Vx(boy(x) ---&gt; saw(x,y)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994600625">
We can also obtain these representations in
our formalism by simply adding new conditions
to (1.1.c), which force the disambigivation of
(1.1.c) with regard to quantifier scope. To
obtain reading (1.2.b), we must come to know
that there is only one movie, which can be
fonnaly writen by I Range saw 1=1, where I . I
denotes the cardinality function. To obtain
reading (1.2.a) from (1.1.c), we do not need any
new information, since the two formulas are
equivalent. This situation is due to the fact
that (1.2.b) implies (1.2.a), which means that
(1.2.b) is a special case of (1.2.a). This relation
can be easly seen by comparing the resulting
formulas, which correspond to readings (1.2.a)
and (1.2.b):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.485914">
(1.3.a) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie Sr
Dom saw=Boy)
(1.3.b) saw (saw c Boy x Movie &amp;
Dom saw=Boy &amp; I Range saw I =1)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991117296296296">
So, we have (1.3.b) =&gt; (1.3.a).
As I have stated above, however, it is not
very useful to disambiguate representation
(1.1.c) immediately. It makes more sense to
leave representation (1.1.c) unchanged for
further processing, since it may be that in the
development a new condition may appear
which determines the scope. For instance, we
can obtain the additional condition in (1.3.b),
when sentence (1.1) is followed by a sentence
containing a pronoun refering to a movie, as in
sentence (1.4).
(1.4) It was &amp;quot;Gone with the Wind&amp;quot;.
Since it refers to a movie, the image of the
saw-relation (a subset of the set of movies) can
contain only one element. Thus, the resolution
of the reference results in an extension of
representation (1.1.c) by the condition
I Range saw 1 = 1. Therefore, we get in this case
only one reading (1.3.b) as a representation of
sentence (1.1), which corresponds to wide scope
of the existential quantifier. Thus in the
context of (1.4) we have disambiguated
sentence (1.1) with regard to quantifier scope
without having first generated all possible
readings (in our case these were (1.2.a) and
(1.2.b)).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990859">
244
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.981748891891892">
A classical scope determining system can
only choose one of the readings (1.2.a) and
(1.2.b). However, if it chooses (1.2.a), it will
not win any new information, since (1.2.b) is a
special case of (1.2.a). So, quantifier scope can
not be completely determined by such a system.
Let us now assume that sentence (1.5)
follows (1.1).
(1.5) All of them were made by Walt Disney
Studios.
Syntactic theories alone are of no help
here for finding the correct discourse referent
for them in sentence (1.1), since there is no
number agreement between them and a movie.
The plural noun them, however, refers to all
movies the boys have seen. This causes great
problems for standard anaphora theories and
plural theories, since there is no explicit object
of reference to which them could refer (cf.
Eschenbach et al. 1990; Link 1986). Thus, the
usual procedure would be to construe a complex
reference object as the sum of all movies the
boys have seen. With my representation, we
do not need such procedures because the
discourse referents are always available,
namely as domains of the relations. In the
context of (1.1) and (1.5), the pronoun them
(just as it in (1.4)) refers to the image of the
relation saw, which additionally serves the
purpose of determining the quantifier scope.
Here, just as in the preceding cases, the
representation (1.1.c) has to be seen as the
&amp;quot;starting representation&amp;quot; of (1.1). The
information that them is a plural noun is
represented by the condition I Range saw I &gt; 1,
which in turn leads to the following
representation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6910605">
(1.6) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie &amp;
Dom saw=Boy &amp; I Range saw I &gt;1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999641">
The representation (1.6) is not ambiguous
with regard to quantifier scope. The universal
quantifier has wide scope over the whole
sentence, due to the condition I Range saw I &gt; 1.
The reading presented in (1.6) is a further
specification of (1.3.a), which at the same
time excludes reading (1.3.b). Thus (1.6)
contains more information that formula
(1.2.a), which is equivalent to (1.3.a).
In order to indicate further advantages of
this representation formalism, let us take a
look at the following sentence (cf. Link 1986):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.575007">
(1.7) Every boy saw a different movie.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.933202923076923">
Its representation is generated in the same
way as that of (1.1), the only difference being
that the word different carries additional
information about the relation saw. different
requires that the relation be injective.
Therefore, the formula (1.1.c) is extended by
the condition &apos;saw is 1-1&apos;. The formula (1.8)
thus represents the only reading of sentence
(1.7), in which scope is completely
determined; the universal quantifier has wide
scope.
(1.8) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie &amp;
Dom saw=Boy &amp; saw is 1-1)

2. SCOPE-AMBIGUOUS
REPRESENTATION FOR
SENTENCES WITH NUMERIC
QUANTIFIERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.896468181818182">
So far, I have not stated exactly how the
representation of sentence (1.1) was generated.
In order to do so, let us take an example
sentence with numeric quantifiers:
(2.1) Two examiners marked six scripts.
It is certainly not a new observation that
this sentence has many interpretations with
regard to quantifier scope and distributivity,
which can be summarized to a few main
readings. However, their exact number is
controversial. While Kempson and Cormack
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996503">
245
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999170739130435">
(1981) assign four readings to this sentence (see
also Lakoff 1972), Davies (1989) assigns eight
readings to it. I quote here the readings from
(Kempson/Cormack 1981):
10 There were two examiners, and each of
them marked six scripts (subject noun phrase
with wide scope). This interpretation could be
true in a situation with two examiners and 12
scripts.
20 There were six scripts, and each of these
was marked by two examiners (object noun
phrase with wide scope). This interpretation
could be true in a situation with twelve
examiners and six scripts.
30 The incomplete group interpretation:
Two examiners as a group marked a group of six
scripts between them.
40 The complete group interpretation: Two
examiners each marked the same set of six
scripts.
Kempson and Cormack represent these
readings with the help of quantifiers over sets
in the following way:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.929287">
1° (3X2)(VxE X2)(3S6)(V5E S6)Mxs
20 (3S6)(Vse S6)(3X2)(VxE X2)Mxs
30 (3X2)(3S6)(VxE X2)(VsE S6)Mxs
40 (3X2)(3S6)(VxE X2)(3sE S6)Mxs &amp;
(VsE S6)(3xE X2)Mxs
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.984583351851852">
Here, X2 is a sorted variable which
denotes a two-element set of examiners, and S6
is a sorted variable that denotes a six-element
set of scripts.
Kempson and Cormack derive these
readings from an initial formula in the
conventional way by changing the order and
distributivity of quantifiers. This fact is
discernible from their derivational rules and
the following quotation:
Generalising:
Replace -(3xe Xn)&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;(VxE Xnr
Uniformising:
Replace &apos;(Vxe Xn)(3Yr by -(31&apos;)(VxE Xnr
&amp;quot;What we are proposing, then, as an
alternative to the conventional
ambiguity account is that all sentences
of a form corresponding to (42) [here:
2.1] have a single logical form, which
is then subject to the procedure of
generalising and uniformising to yield
the various interpretations of the
sentence in use.&amp;quot; (Kempson/Cormack
(1981), p. 273)
Only in reading 40 the relation between
examiners and scripts is completely
characterized. For the other formulas there
are several possible assignments between
examiners and scripts which make these
formulas valid.
At this point I want to make an important
observation, namely that these four readings
are not totally independent of one another. I
am, however, not concerned with logical
implications between these readings alone, but
rather with the fact that there is a piece of
information which is contained in all of these
readings and which does not necessitate a
determinated quantifier scope. This is the
information which - cognitively speaking - can
be extracted from the sentence by a listener
without determining the quantifier scope. The
difficulties which people have when they are
forced to disambiguate a sentence containing
numeric quantifiers such as (2.1) without a
specific context point to the fact that only such
a scopeless representation is assigned to the
sentence in the first place. On the basis of this
representation one can then, within a given
context, derive a representation with a
definite scope. We can describe the scopeless
piece of information of sentence (2.1), which
all readings have in common, as follows. We
know that we are dealing with a marking-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995989">
246
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994768017241379">
relation between examiners and scripts, and
that we are always dealing with two
examiners or with six scripts. In the formalism
described in this paper this piece of
information is represented as:
(2.2) 3mark ( mark c Examiner x Script &amp;
( I Dom mark1=2 v I Range mark1=6) )
It may be that this piece of information is
sufficient in order to understand sentence (2.1).
If there is no scope-determining information in
the given context, people can understand the
sentence just as well. If, for example, we hear
the following utterance,
(2.3) In preparation for our workshop, two
examiners corrected six scripts.
it may be without any relevance what the
relation between examiners and scripts is
exactly like. The only important thing may be
that the examiners corrected the scripts and
that we have an idea about the number of
examiners and the number of scripts.
Therefore, we have assigned an under-
determined scope-ambiguous representation
(2.2) to sentence (2.1), which constitutes the
maximum scopeless content of information of
this sentence. The lower line of (2.2) represents
a scope-neutral part of the information which
is contained in the meaning of the quantifiers
two examiners and six scripts. This fact
indicates that the meaning of a quantifier has
to be structured internally, since a quantifier
contains scope-neutral as well as scope-
determining information. Distributivity is an
example of scope-determining information.
Then what happens in a context which
contains scope-determining information? This
context just provides restrictions on the
domains of the relation. These restrictions in
turn contribute to scope determination. We
may, for instance, get to know in a given
context that there were twelve scripts in all,
which excludes the condition I Range mark 1=6
in the disjunction of (2.2). We then know for
certain that there were two examiners and
that each of them marked six different scripts.
Consequently, the quantifier two examiners
acquires wide scope, and we are dealing with a
distributive reading. Thus, in this context we
have completely disambiguated sentence (2.1)
with regard to quantifier scope; and that
simply on the basis of the scopeless,
incomplete representation (2.2). On the other
hand, standard procedures (the most
important were listed at the beginning) first
have to generate all representations of this
sentence by considering all combinatorically
possible scopes together with distributive and
collective readings.

3. CONCLUDING REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987296296296">
A cognitively adequate method for
dealing with sentences that are ambiguous
with regard to quantifier scope has been
described in this paper. An underdetermined
scope-ambiguous representation is assigned to
a scope-ambiguous sentence and then extended
by additional conditions from context and
world knowledge, which further specify the
meaning of the sentence. Scope determination
in this procedure can be seen as a mere by-
product. The quantifier scope is completely
determined when the representation which
was generated in this way corresponds to an
interpretation with a fixed scope. Of course,
this only works if there is scope-determining
information; if not, one continues to work with
the scope-ambiguous representation.
I use the language of second-order
predicate logic here, but not the whole second-
order logic, since I need deduction rules for
scope derivation, but not deduction rules for
second-order predicate logic (which cannot be
completely stated). One could even use the
formalism for scope determination alone and
then translate the obtained readings into a
first-order formalism. However, the
formalism lends itself very easily to

The scope determination results in extending this representation with additional context and world knowledge conditions. If there is no scope determining information, the formalism can work further with this scope-ambiguous representation. Thus scope information does not have to be completely determined.</abstract>

Let us take the following sentence from Kempson/Cormack (1981) as an example: Two examiners marked six scripts. The two quantifying noun phrases can in this case be interpreted either distributively or collectively. The quantifier two examiners can have wide scope over the quantifier six scripts, or vice versa, which all in all can lead to various readings. Kempson and Cormack assign four possible readings to this sentence, 241 Davies (1989) even eight. (A detailed discussion will follow.) No one, however, will make the claim that people will first assign all possible representations with regard to the scope of the quantifiers and their distribution, and will then eliminate certain interpretations according to the context; but this is today&apos;s standard procedure in linguistics. In many cases, it is also almost impossible to determine a preferred reading.

The quantifiers (noun phrases) constitute restrictions on the domains of these relations. 3. Natural language sentences have more than one reading with regard to quantifier scope (and distributivity), but these readings are not independent of one another. The target representation makes the logical dependencies of the readings easily discernible. 4. The construction of complex discourse referents for anaphoric processes requires the construction of complex sums of existing discourse referents. In conventional approaches, this can lead to a combinatorical explosion (cf. Eschenbach et al. 1989 and 1990). In the representation which is presented here, the discourse referents are immediately available as domains of the relations. Therefore, we need not construe any complex discourse referents. Sometimes we have to specify a discourse referent in more detail, which in turn can lead to a reduction in the number of possible readings. I now present the formalism. The representational language used here is second-order predicate logic. However, I will mainly use set-theoretical notation (which can be seen as an abbreviation of the Let R ç XxY be a relation, that means, a sub-set of the pr</context>

Let us now assume that sentence (1.5) follows (1.1). (1.5) All of them were made by Walt Disney Studios. Syntactic theories alone are of no help here for finding the correct discourse referent for them in sentence (1.1), since there is no number agreement between them and a movie. The plural noun them, however, refers to all movies the boys have seen. This causes great problems for standard anaphora theories and plural theories, since there is no explicit object of reference to which them could refer (cf. Eschenbach et al. 1990; Link 1986). Thus, the usual procedure would be to construe a complex reference object as the sum of all movies the boys have seen. With my representation, we do not need such procedures because the discourse referents are always available, namely as domains of the relations. In the context of (1.1) and (1.5), the pronoun them (just as it in (1.4)) refers to the image of the relation saw, which additionally serves the purpose of determining the quantifier scope. Here, just as in the preceding cases, the representation (1.1.c) has to be seen as the &amp;quot;starting representation&amp;quot; of (1.1). The information that </context>

The universal quantifier has wide scope over the whole sentence, due to the condition I Range saw I &gt; 1. The reading presented in (1.6) is a further specification of (1.3.a), which at the same time excludes reading (1.3.b). Thus (1.6) contains more information that formula (1.2.a), which is equivalent to (1.3.a). In order to indicate further advantages of this representation formalism, let us take a look at the following sentence (cf. Link 1986): (1.7) Every boy saw a different movie. Its representation is generated in the same way as that of (1.1), the only difference being that the word different carries additional information about the relation saw. different requires that the relation be injective. Therefore, the formula (1.1.c) is extended by the condition &apos;saw is 1-1&apos;. The formula (1.8) thus represents the only reading of sentence (1.7), in which scope is completely determined; the universal quantifier has wide scope.
