Traditionally, translation from the parse tree repre-
senting a sentence to a semantic representation (such
as frames or procedural semantics) has always been
the most ad hoc part of natural language understand-
ing (NLU) systems. However, recent advances in lin-
guistics, most notably the system of formal semantics
known as Montague semantics, suggest ways of putting
NLU semantics onto a cleaner and firmer foundation.
We are using a Montague-inspired approach to seman-
tics in an integrated NLU and problem-solving system
that we are building. Like Montague&apos;s, our semantics
are compositional by design and strongly typed, with
semantic rules in one-to-one correspondence with the
meaning-affecting rules of a Marcus-style parser. We
have replaced Montague&apos;s semantic objects, functors
and truth conditions, with the elements of the frame
language Frail, and added a word sense and case slot
disambiguation system. The result is a foundation for
semantic interpretation that we believe to be superior
to previous approaches.

By semantic interpretation we mean the process of
mapping from a syntactically analyzed sentence of
natural language to a representation of its meaning.
We exclude from semantic interpretation any con-
sideration of discourse pragmatics; rather, discourse
pragmatics operate upon the output of the semantic
interpreter. We also exclude syntactic analysis; the
integration of syntactic and semantic analysis becomes
very messy when complex syntactic constructions are
considered, and, moreover, it is our observation that
those who argue for the integration of the two are
usually arguing for subordinating the role of syntax, a
position we reject. This is not to say that parsing can
get by without semantic help; indirect object finding,

and prepositional phrase and relative clause attach-
ment, for example, often require semantic knowledge.
Below we will show that syntax and semantics may
work well together while remaining distinct modules.
Research on semantic interpretation in artificial
intelligence goes back to Woods&apos;s dissertation (1967,
1968), which introduced procedural semantics in a
natural-language front-end for an airline reservation
system. Woods&apos;s system had rules with patterns that,
when they matched part of the parsed input sentence,
contributed a string to the semantic representation
of the sentence. This string was usually constructed
from the terminals of the matched parse tree frag-
ment. The strings were combined to form a procedure
call that, when evaluated, entered or retrieved the ap-
propriate database information. This approach is still
the predominant one today, and even though it has
been refined over the years, semantic interpretation
remains perhaps the least understood and most ad hoc
area of natural language understanding (NLU).&apos;
However, recent advances in linguistics, most not-
ably Montague semantics (Montague 1973; Dowty,
Wall and Peters 1981), suggest ways of putting NLU
semantic interpretation on a cleaner and firmer foun-
dation than it now is. In this paper, we describe such
a foundation.2

In his well-known &amp;quot;PTQ&amp;quot; paper (Montague 1973),
Richard Montague presented the complete syntax and
semantics for a small fragment of English. Although
it was limited in vocabulary and syntactic com-
plexity, Montague&apos;s fragment dealt with such

tant semantic problems as opaque contexts, different
types of predication with the word be, and the &amp;quot;the
temperature is 90&amp;quot; problem;3 for details of these, see
Dowty, Wall and Peters (1981).
Montague&apos;s semantic rules correspond to what we
have been calling semantic interpretation. That is, in
conjunction with a syntactic process, they produce a
semantic representation, or translation, of a sentence.
There are four important properties of Montague
semantics that we will examine here. Below, we
will carry three of these properties over into our own
semantics.
The first property, the one that we will later drop,
is that for Montague, semantic objects, the results
of the semantic translation, were such things as in-
dividual concepts (which are functions to individuals
from the cartesian product of points in time and pos-
sible worlds), properties of individual concepts, and
functions of functions of functions of functions. At the
top level, the meaning. of a sentence was a truth con-
dition relative to a possible world and point in time.
These semantic objects were represented by expres-
sions of intensional logic; that is, instead of translat-
ing English directly into these objects, a sentence was
first translated to an expression of intensional logic,
for which, in turn, there existed an interpretation in
terms of these semantic objects.
Second, Montague had a strong theory of types for
his semantic objects: a set of types that corresponded
to types of syntactic constituents. Thus, given a par-
ticular syntactic category, such as proper noun or ad-
verb, Montague was able to say that the meaning of
a constituent of that category was a semantic object
of such and such a type.4 Montague&apos;s system of types
was recursively defined, with entities, truth values and
intensions as primitives, and other types defined as
functions from one type to another in such a manner
that if syntactic category X was formed by adding
category Y to category Z, then the type correspond-
ing to Z would be functions from senses of the type of
Y to the type of X.5
Third, in Montague&apos;s system the syntactic rules
and semantic rules are in one-to-one correspondence.
Each time a particular syntactic rule applies, so
does the corresponding semantic rule; while the one
operates on some syntactic elements to create a new
element, the other operates on the corresponding
semantic objects to create a new object that will cor-
respond to the new syntactic element. Thus the two
sets of rules operate in tandem.
Fourth, Montague&apos;s semantics is compositional,
which is to say that the meaning of the whole is a
systematic function of the meaning of the parts. At
first glance this sounds trivial; if the noun phrase my
pet penguin denotes by itself some particular entity,
namely the one sitting on my lap as I write this paper,
then we do not expect it to refer to a different entity
when it is embedded in the sentence I love my pet
penguin, and a semantic system that did not reflect
this would be a loser indeed. Yet there are alternatives
to compositional semantics.
The first alternative is that the meaning of the
whole is a function of not just the parts but also the
situation in which the sentence is uttered. For ex-
ample, the possessive in English is highly dependent
upon pragmatics; the phrase Nadia&apos;s penguin could
refer, in different circumstances, to the penguin that
Nadia owns, to the one that she is carrying but doesn&apos;t
actually own, or to the one that she just bet on at the
penguin races. Our definition above of semantic inter-
pretation excluded this sort of consideration, but this
should not be regarded as uncontroversial.
The second alternative to compositional semantics
is that the meaning of the whole is not a systematic
function of the parts in any reasonable sense of the
word. This is exemplified by the interpretation of the
word depart in Woods&apos;s original system, which varied
greatly depending on the preposition it dominated
(Woods 1967:A-43—A-46). For example, the interpreta-
tion of the sentence:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.967311454545454">
AA-57 departs from Boston.
3That is, to ensure that &amp;quot;The temperature is 90 and the tem-
perature is rising&apos; cannot lead to the inference that &amp;quot;90 is ris-
ing&amp;quot;.
4To be precise: the semantic type of a proper noun is set of
properties of individual concepts; that of an adverb is function
between Betb a individual concepts (Dowty et at 1981: 183, 187).
is, not unreasonably:
5For example, the semantic type of prepositions is functions
mapping senses of the type of noun phrases to the semantic type
of prepositional phrases.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999364">
65
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990066413793103">
depart (aa-57, boston).
That is, the semantic object into which depart is
translated is the procedure depart. (AA-57 is an air-
line flight.) However, the addition of a prepositional
phrase changes this; Table 1 shows the interpreta-
tion of the same sentence after various prepositional
phrases have been appended. For example, the addi-
tion of to Chicago changes the translation of depart
to Connect, though the intended sense of the word is
clearly unchanged.°
This is necessitated by the particular set of
database primitives that Woods used, selected for
their being &amp;quot;atomic&amp;quot; (1967:7-4-7-11) rather than for
promoting compositionality. Rules in the system are
able to generate non-compositional representations be-
cause they have the power to set an arbitrarily complex
parse tree as their trigger, and to return an arbitrary
representation that could modify or completely ignore
the components of the parse trees they are supposed to
be interpreting:7 For example, a rule can say (1967:A-
44):
If you have a sentence whose subject is a flight,
whose verb is leave or depart, and which has
two (or more) prepositional phrases modifying
the verb, one with from and a place name, the
other with at and a time, then the interpretation
is equal (dtime (a, b), e), where a is the
flight, b is the place, and c is the time.
Thus while Woods&apos;s semantics could probably be made
</bodyText>

• reasonably compositional simply by appropriate ad-
justment of the procedure calls into which sentences
are translated, it would still not be compositional by
design the way Montague semantics is.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.854549384615385">
8We have simplified a little here in order to make our point. In
fact, sentences like those in Table 1 with prepositional phrases
will actually cause the execution of two semantic rules: one for
the complete sentence, and one for the sentence it happens to
contain, AA-57 departs from Boston. The resulting interpreta-
tion will be the conjunction of the output from each rule (Woods
1967.9-5):
AA-57 departs from Boston to Chicago.
depart (aa-57, boston) and connect (aa-57, Dogma, Chicago)
Areode leaves it open (1967:9-7) as to how the semantic redun-
dancy in such expressions should be handled, though one of his
suggestions is a filter that would remove conjuncts implied by
others, giving, in this case, the interpretation shown in Table 1.

that would result in conjunctions with conflicting, rather than
merely redundant, terms.

Although Montague semantics has much to recom-
mend it, it is not possible, how. ever, to implement it
directly in a practical NLU system, for two reasons.
The first is that Montague semantics as currently for-
mulated is computationally impractical. It throws
around huge sets, infinite objects, functions of func-
tions, and piles of possible worlds with great abandon.
Friedman, Moran and Warren (1978a) point out that
in the smallest possible Montague system, one with
two entities and two points of reference, there are, for
example, 223 elements in the class of possible denota-
tions of prepositions, each element being a set contain-
ing 2512 ordered pairs.5
The second reason we can&apos;t use Montague seman-
tics directly is that truth-conditional semantics are not
useful in Al; AI uses knowledge semantics (Tarnawksy
1982) in which semantic objects tend to be symbols or
expressions in a declarative or procedural knowledge
representation system. Moreover, truth-conditional
semantics really only deals with declarative sentences
(Dowty et al 1981:13) (though there has been work
attempting to extend Montague&apos;s work to questions;
e.g. Hamblin 1973); a practical NLU system needs to
be able to deal with commands and questions as well
as declarative sentences.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.95232">
8Despite this problem, Friedman et at (1978b, 1978c) have imple-
mented Montague semantics computationally by using tech-
niques for maintaining partially specified models. However, their
system is intended as a tool for understanding Montague seman-
tics better, rather than as a usable NLU system (1978b:28).

<bodyText confidence="0.99997188">
There have, however, been attempts to take the
intensional logic that Montague uses as an inter-
mediate step in his translations, and give it a new in-
terpretation in terms of AI—type semantic objects, thus
preserving all other aspects of Montague&apos;s approach;
see, for example, Hobbs and Rosenschein 1977, and
Smith&apos;s (1979) objections to their approach. There has
also been interest in using the intensional logic itself
(or something similar) as an Al representationg (e.g.
Moore 1981). But while it may be possible to make
limited use of intensional logic expressions,&apos;° there are
many problems that need to be solved before inten-
sional logic or other flavors of logical forms could sup-
port the type of inference and problem solving that
Al requires of its semantic representations; see Moore
1981 for a useful discussion. Moreover, Gallin (1975)
has shown Montague&apos;s intensional logic to be incom-
plete. (See also the discussion in Section 7 of work
using logical forms.)
Nevertheless, it is possible to use many aspects of
Montague&apos;s approach in semantics in Al. The seman-
tic interpreter that we describe below maintains three
of the four properties of Montague semantics that
we described above, and we therefore refer to it as
&amp;quot;Montague-inspired&amp;quot;.

3. Our semantic interpreter
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993525071428571">
Our semantic interpreter is a component of a system
that uses a frame-like representation for both story
comprehension and problem-solving. The system in-
cludes a frame language, named Frail, a problem sol-
ver, and a discourse pragmatics component; further
details may be found in Charniak 1981, Wong 1981a,
and Wong 1981b. The natural language front-end in-
cludes Paragram, a deterministic parser based on that
of Marcus (1980). Unlike Marcus&apos;s parser, Paragram
has two types of rule: base phrase structure rules and
transformational rules. It is also able to parse un-
grammatical sentences; it always uses the rule that
matches best, even if none match exactly. Paragram
is described in Charniak 1983.

<tableCaption confidence="0.628629166666667">
°Ironically, Montague regarded intensional logic merely as a con-
venience in specifying his translation, and one that was com-
pletely irrelevant to the substance of his semantic theories.

ween Thai and English.

aThe question-mark prefix indicates a variable. Whenever a free
variable in a frame is bound to a variable in a frame determiner, a
unique new name is generated for that variable and its bindings.
In this paper, we shall assume for simplicity that variable names
are magically &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; from the start.
Do not be misled by the fact that frames and frame determiners
look similar. They are actually very different: the first is a static
data structure; the second is a frame retrieval procedure.
eAn instance is the result of evaluating a frame statement in Frail.
It is a symbol that denotes the object referenced by the frame
statement. To Absity, there is no distinction between the two; an
instance can be used wherever a frame statement can.
The semantic interpreter is named Absity (for
reasons too obscure to burden the reader with). As
we mentioned above, it retains three of the four
properties of Montague semantics that we discussed.
The property that we have dropped is, of course, truth
conditionality and Montague&apos;s associated treasury of
semantic objects. We have replaced them with AI—

which are components of the frame language Frail.11
We do, however, retain a strong typing upon our
semantic objects, that is, each syntactic category has
an associated semantic type. Table 2 shows the types
of components of Frail, how they may be combined,
and examples of each; the nature of the components
listed will become clearer with the examples in the
next section. Table 3 gives the component of Frail that
corresponds to each syntactic type. As a consequence
of the kind of semantic objects we are dealing with,
the system of types is not recursively defined in the
Montague style, but we retain the idea that the type
of a semantic object should be a function of the types
of the components of that object.
We have also carried over from Montague seman-
tics the operation of syntactic and semantic rules in
tandem upon corresponding objects. However, it is not
possible to maintain the one-to-one correspondence of
rules when we replace Montague&apos;s simple syntax with
the much larger English grammar of the Paragram
parser. This is because in Montague&apos;s system each syn-
tactic rule either creates a new node from old ones—
for example, forming an intransitive verb phrase from
a transitive verb and a noun phrase—or places a new

tics in the strict Woods sense, as the meaning inheres not in the
procedures but in the objects they manipulate.
node under an existing one—such as adding an adverb
to an existing intransitive verb phrase. These are ac-
tions that clearly have semantic counterparts. When
we start to add movement rules such as passivization
and dative movement to the grammar, we find our-
selves with rules that have no clear semantic counter-
part; indeed with rules that, it is often claimed (e.g.
Chomsky 1965:132), leave the meaning of a sentence
quite unchanged.
We therefore distinguish between parser rules that
should have corresponding semantic rules and those
that should not. As the above discussion suggests,
rules that attach nodes are the ones that have seman-
tic counterparts. In Paragram, these are the base
structure rules. For this subset of the syntactic rules,
semantic rules run in tandem, just as in Montague&apos;s
semantics.12
It is a consequence of the above properties of
our semantic interpreter that we have also retained
the property of compositionality by design. This fol-
lows from the uniform typing; the correspondence bet-
ween syntactic and semantic rules that maintains this
uniformity; and there being a unique semantic object
corresponding to each word of English13 (see Dowty et
al 1981:180-181). Unlike those of Woods&apos;s (1967) air-
line reservation system front-end discussed in Section
2, our semantic rules are very weak: they cannot
change or ignore the components upon which they
operate, nor can more than one rule volunteer an inter-
pretation for any node of the parse tree. The power of
the system comes from the nature of the semantic ob-
jects and the syntax-directed application of semantic
rules, rather than from the semantic rules themselves.

<bodyText confidence="0.999770833333333">
Some examples will make our semantic interpreter
clearer. First, let&apos;s consider a simple noun phrase,
the book. From Table 3, the semantic type for the
determiner the is a frame determiner function, in this
case (the ?x), and the type for the noun book is a
kind of frame, here (book ?x). These are combined

12In her synthesis of transformational syntax with Montague
semantics, Partee (1973, 1975) observes that the semantic rule
corresponding to many transformations will simply be the iden-
tity mapping.
13We show in Section 8 how this may be reconciled with lexical
ambiguity.

<bodyText confidence="0.996005432432432">
in the canonical way—the frame name is added as an
argument to the frame determiner function—and the
result, (the ?x (book ?x)), is a Frail frame state-
ment (which evaluates to an instance) that represents
the unique book referred to.&amp;quot;
A descriptive adjective corresponds to a slot-filler
pair; for example, red is represented by (color=red),
where color is the name of a slot and red is a frame
instance, the name of a frame. A slot-filler pair
can be added as an argument to a frame, so the red
book would have the semantic interpretation (the ?x
(book ?x (color=red))).
Now let&apos;s consider a complete sentence:
Nadia bought the book from a store in the mall.
Table 4 shows the representation for each component
of the sentence; note that the basic noun phrases
have already been formed in the manner described
above. Note also that we have inserted the pseudo-
prepositional subject and object markers SUBJ and
oar, which are then treated as if they were real
prepositions; see Hirst and Charniak 1982 or Hirst
1983 for details of this. For simplicity, we assume that
each word is unambiguous (we discuss our disambigua-
tion procedures in Section 6); we also ignore the tense
cn the verb. Table 5 shows the next four stages in the
interpretation. First, noun phrases and their preposi-
tions are combined, forming slot-filler pairs. Then the
prepositional phrase in the mall can be attached to a
store (since a noun phrase, being a frame, can have
a slot-filler pair added to it), and the prepositional
phrase from a store in the mall is formed. The third
stage shown in the Table is the attachment of the slot-
filler pairs for the three top-level prepositional phrases
to the frame representing the verb. Finally, the period,
which is translated as a frame determiner function,
causes instantiation of the buy frame, and the trans-
lation is complete.

One problem that Montague semantics does not ad-
dress is that of word disambiguation. Rather, there is
assumed to exist a function that maps each word to a
unique sense, and the semantic formalism operates on
the values of this function.15 Clearly, however, a prac-
tical NLU system must take account of word sense am-
biguity, and so we must add a disambiguation facility
to our interpreter. Fortunately, the word translation
function allows us to add this facility transparently.
Instead of simply mapping a word to an invariant
unique sense, the function can map it to whatever
sense is correct for a particular instance.

a separate process that, by talking to other processes
and by looking at paths made by spreading activation
in the knowledge base, figures out the word&apos;s mean-
ing. Each word is like a self-developing photograph
that can be manipulated by the semantic interpreter
even while the picture is forming; and if some other
process needs to look at the picture (e.g. if the
Semantic Enquiry Desk has an &amp;quot;if semantics prefers&amp;quot;
question from the parser), then a half-developed pic-
ture may provide enough information. Exactly the
same process, without the spreading-activation phase,
is used to disambiguate case roles as well. Polaroid

7. Comparison with other work
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996545951219512">
Our approach to semantic interpretation may usefully
be compared with other recent work with similar goals
to ours.
One such project is that of Jones and Warren
(1982), who attempt a conciliation between Montague
semantics and a conceptual dependency representation
(Schank 1975). Their approach is to modify Montague&apos;s
translation from English to intensional logic so that
the resulting expressions have a canonical interpreta-
tion in conceptual dependency. They do not ad-
dress such issues as extending Montague&apos;s syntax, nor
whether their approach can be extended to deal with
more modern Schankian representations (e.g. Schank
1982). Nevertheless, their work, which they describe
as a hesitant first step, is similar in spirit to ours, and
it will be interesting to see how it develops.
Important recent work that extends the syntac-
tic complexity of Montague&apos;s work is that on general-
ized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar 1982).
Such grammars combine a complex transformation-
free syntax with Montague&apos;s semantics, the rules again
operating in tandem. Gawron et al (1982) have imple-
mented a database interface based on GPSG. In their
system, the intensional logic of the semantic com-
ponent is replaced by a simplified extensional logic,
which, in turn, is translated into a query for database
access. Schubert and Pelletier (1982) have also sought
to simplify the semantic output of a GPSG to a more
&amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; logical form; and Rosenschein and
Shieber (1982) describe a similar translation process
into extensional logical forms, using a context-free
grammar intended to be similar to a GPSG.17
The GPSG approaches differ from ours in that
their output is a logical form rather than an im-
mediate representation of a semantic object; that
is, the output is not tied to any representation of
knowledge. In Gawron et al&apos;s system, the database
17Rosenschein and Shieber&apos;s semantic translation follows pass-
ing rather than running in parallel with it, but it is strongly
syntax-directed, and is, it seems, isomorphic to an in-tandem
translation that provides no feedback to the parser.

provides an interpretation of the logical form, but
only in a weak sense, as the form must first pass
through another (apparently somewhat ad hoc) trans-
lation and disambiguation process. Nor do these ap-
proaches provide any semantic feedback to the par-
ser.18 These differences, however, are independent of
the choice of GPSG; it should be easy, at least in prin-
ciple, to modify these approaches to give Frail output,
or, conversely, to replace Paragram in our system with
a GPSG parser.&apos;
The PSI-KLONE system of Bobrow and Webber
(1980a, 1980b) also has a close coupling between syn-
tax and semantics. Rather than operating in tandem,
though, the two are described as &amp;quot;cascaded&amp;quot;, with an
ATN parser handing constituents to a semantic in-
terpreter, which is allowed to return them (causing
the ATN to back up) if the parser&apos;s choice is found
to be semantically untenable. Otherwise, a process
of incremental description refinement is used to in-
terpret the constituent; this relies on the fact that
the syntactic constituents are represented in the same
formalism, KL-ONE (Brachman 1978), as the system&apos;s
knowledge base. The semantic interpreter uses projec-
tion rules to form an interpretation in a language
called JARGON, which is then translated into KL-ONE.
Bobrow and Webber are particularly concerned with
using this framework to determine the combinatoric
relationship between quantifiers in a sentence.
Bobrow and Webber&apos;s approach addresses several
of the issues that we do, in particular the relationship
between syntax and semantics. The information feed-
back to the parser is similar to our Semantic Enquiry
Desk, though in our system, because the parser is
deterministic, semantic feedback cannot be conflated
with syntactic success or failure. Both approaches rely
on the fact that the objects manipulated are objects of
a knowledge representation that permits appropriate
judgments to be made, though in rather a different
manner.
Hendler and Phillips (1981; Phillips and Hendler
1982) have implemented a control structure for NLU
18Gawron et at produce all possible trees and their translations
for the input sentence, and then throw away any that don&apos;t make
sense to the database.

based on message passing, with the goal of running
syntax and semantics in parallel and providing seman-
tic feedback to the parser. A &amp;quot;moderator&amp;quot; trans-
lates between syntactic constructs and semantic repre-
sentations. However, their approach to interpretation
is essentially ad hoc (James Hendler, person..., Qom-
munication), and they do not attempt to put syntactic
and semantic rules in strict correspondence, nor type
their semantic objects.
None of the work mentioned above addresses
issues of lexical ambiguity as ours does, though
Bobrow and Webber&apos;s incremental description refine-
ment could possibly be extended to cover it. Also,
Gawron et al have a process to disambiguate case roles
in the logical form after it is complete, which operates
in a manner not dissimilar to the case-slot part of
Polaroid Words.
8. Conclusion
We have described a new approach to semantic inter-
pretation, one suggested by the semantic formalism
of Richard Montague. We believe this work to be a
clean and elegant foundation for semantic interpreta-
tion, in contrast to previous ad hoc approaches. At
the moment, though, the work is only a foundation;
the test of a foundation is what can be constructed
on top of it. We do not expect the construction to be
unproblematic; here are some of the problems we will
have to solve.
First, the approach is not just compositional but
almost too compositional. At present, noun phrases
are taken to be invariably and unalterably specific
and extensional, that is to imply the existence of the
unique entity or set of entities that they specify. In
English, this is not always correct. A sentence such
as:
Nadia owns a unicorn.
implies that a unicorn exists, but this is not true of:
Nadia talked about a unicorn.
which also has a non-specific reading. Montague&apos;s
solution to this problem does not seem easily adaptable

to Absity.2° Similarly, a sentence such as:
The lion is not a beast to be trifled with.
can be a generic statement intended to be true of all
lions; Montague did not treat generics.
Second, the approach is heavily dependent upon
the expressive power of the underlying frame language.
For example, our language, Frail, is yet deficient in
its handling of time, and this is clearly reflected in
Absity. Further, the approach makes certain claims
about the nature of frame representations-that a
descriptive adjective in some sense is a slot-filler pair,
for example-that might be shown to be untenable.
We will also have to deal with problems in
quantification, anaphoric reference, and many other
areas. Nevertheless, we believe that this approach to
semantic interpretation shows considerable promise.

There has also been interest in using the intensional logic itself (or something similar) as an Al representationg (e.g. Moore 1981). But while it may be possible to make limited use of intensional logic expressions,&apos;° there are many problems that need to be solved before intensional logic or other flavors of logical forms could support the type of inference and problem solving that Al requires of its semantic representations; see Moore 1981 for a useful discussion. Moreover, Gallin (1975) has shown Montague&apos;s intensional logic to be incomplete. (See also the discussion in Section 7 of work using logical forms.) Nevertheless, it is possible to use many aspects of Montague&apos;s approach in semantics in Al. The semantic interpreter that we describe below maintains three of the four properties of Montague semantics that we described above, and we therefore refer to it as &amp;quot;Montague-inspired&amp;quot;. 3. Our semantic interpreter Our semantic interpreter is a component of a system that uses a frame-like representation for both story comprehension and problem-solving. The system includes a frame</context>
<context position="20774" citStr="(1973, 1975)" startWordPosition="3322" endWordPosition="3323"> any node of the parse tree. The power of the system comes from the nature of the semantic objects and the syntax-directed application of semantic rules, rather than from the semantic rules themselves. 4. Examples Some examples will make our semantic interpreter clearer. First, let&apos;s consider a simple noun phrase, the book. From Table 3, the semantic type for the determiner the is a frame determiner function, in this case (the ?x), and the type for the noun book is a kind of frame, here (book ?x). These are combined 12In her synthesis of transformational syntax with Montague semantics, Partee (1973, 1975) observes that the semantic rule corresponding to many transformations will simply be the identity mapping. 13We show in Section 8 how this may be reconciled with lexical ambiguity. 68 in the canonical way—the frame name is added as an argument to the frame determiner function—and the result, (the ?x (book ?x)), is a Frail frame statement (which evaluates to an instance) that represents the unique book referred to.&amp;quot; A descriptive adjective corresponds to a slot-filler pair; for example, red is represented by (color=red), where color is the name of a slot and red is a frame instance, the name o</context>
