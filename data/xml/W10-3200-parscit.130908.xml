Language resources play a central role in statistical and learning-based approaches to natural language
processing. Thus, recent research has put great emphasis in building these resources for target languages.
Parallel resources across various languages are also being developed for multilingual processing. These
include lexica and corpora with multiple levels of annotations. Though significant progress has been
achieved in modeling few of the Asian languages, with the wider spread of ICT use across the region,
there is a growing interest in this field from other linguistic communities. As research in the field matures
across Asia, there is a growing need for developing language resources. However the region is not only
short in the linguistic resources for more than 2200 language spoken in the region, there is also lack of
experience in the researchers to develop these resources. As the efforts to develop the linguistic resources
increases, there is also need to coordinate the efforts to develop common frameworks and processes so
that these resources can be used by various groups of researchers equally effectively.
The workshop is organised by the Asian Language Resources Committee (ALRC) of Asian Federation
for Natural Language Processing (AFNLP). The aim are to chart and catalogue the status of Asian
Language Resources, to investigate and discuss the problems related to the standards and specification on
creating and sharing various levels of language resources, to promote a dialogue between developers and
users of various language resources in order to address any gaps in language resources and practical
applications, and to nurture collaboration in their development and use, to provide opportunity for
researchers from Asia to collaborate with researchers in other regions.
This is the eighth workshop in the series, and has been representative, with 35 submissions for Asian
languages, including Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese, Dzongkha, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Sindhi, Sinhala,
Thai, Turkish and Urdu, of which 22 have been finalized for presentation. We would like to thank the
authors for their submissions and the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We hope that ALR
workshops will continue to encourage researchers to focus on developing and sharing resources for Asian
languages, an essential requirement for research in NLP.
