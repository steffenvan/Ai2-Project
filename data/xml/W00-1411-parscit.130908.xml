<bodyText confidence="0.999954142857143">
This paper describes an implemented system
which uses centering theory for planning of co-
herent texts and choice of referring expressions.
We argue that text and sentence planning need
to be driven in part by the goal of maintain-
ing referential continuity and thereby facilitat-
ing pronoun resolution: obtaining a favourable
ordering of clauses, and of arguments within
clauses, is likely to increase opportunities for
non-ambiguous pronoun use. Centering theory
provides the basis for such an integrated ap-
proach. Generating coherent texts according to
centering theory is treated as a constraint sat-
isfaction problem.

1.1 Issues in pronoun generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99500192">
The appropriate realisation of anaphoric expres-
sions is a long-standing problem in NLG re-
search. However, as McCoy and Strube (1999)
observe, few researchers have developed sophis-
ticated algorithms for pronoun generation. A
typical approach, exemplified by Dale (1993),
Reiter and Dale (1997) is to pronominalise some
distinguished referent which was mentioned in
the previous sentence according to a domain-
dependent criterion of prominence or salience.
McCoy and Strube (op cit.) offer a more com-
plex algorithm based on the notion of &amp;quot;dis-
course threads&amp;quot;, for which they report an ac-
curacy of 85% when tested against a corpus
of naturally-occurring texts. Their approach
makes some fundamental assumptions about
discourse structure which appear to be beyond
the capabilities of current text and sentence
planners and are incompatible with the widely-
accepted notion of discourse structure as a tree
with non-crossing branches (e.g., Mann and
Thompson 1987).
We argue for an approach which integrates
the tasks of text planning and choice of referring
expression on the following grounds:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.863965625">
• portability: this approach should be com-
patible with any system that employs hi-
erarchical text planning and certain basic
grammatical categories;
o coherence: we claim that text planning
needs to be driven in part by the goal of
maintaining referential continuity: obtain-
ing a favourable ordering of clauses, and

of arguments within clauses, is likely to
increase opportunities for non-ambiguous
pronoun use.
The latter claim is not new, but underlies the
Centering Theory (CT) of Grosz, Joshi and We-
instein (1995, hereafter &amp;quot;GJW&amp;quot; ).

1.2 Issues in Text Planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998849125">
Text Planning is one of the distinct tasks iden-
tified in Reiter&apos;s &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; architecture for
Natural Language Generation (Reiter 1994, Re-
iter and Dale 1997):
Text Planning - deciding the content of a
message, and organising the component
propositions into a text tree;
Sentence Planning - aggregating proposi-
tions into clausal units and choosing lex-
ical items corresponding to concepts in the
knowledge base;
Linguistic realisation - surface details such
as agreement, orthography etc.
Following Scott and de Souza (1990), we as-
sume that the component propositions to be re-
alised in a text are organised in a tree structure

in which terminal nodes are elementary propo-
sitions and non-terminal nodes represent dis-
course relations as defined by e.g., Rhetorical
Structure Theory (RST, Mann and Thompson
1987). This structure only partially constrains
the linear order in which the propositions will
be realised — in other words, any RST struc-
ture specifies a range of possible text plans. We
propose as an additional constraint that the
generator should seek to maximise continuity
of reference as determined by centering theory,
and we argue that this enables us to select the
most cohesive variants from a set of text plans.
The RST tree itself is produced by an interac-
tive knowledge base editor which allows a user
to control both semantic content and rhetorical
structure via a sequence of choices guided by a
natural language interface.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997959">
2.1 Centering in a nutshell
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999148">
The main assumptions of Centering theory are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977157976190476">
1. For each utterance in a discourse there is
precisely one entity which is the centre of atten-
tion or center. The center in an utterance Un is
the most grammatically salient entity realised
in Un_1 which is also realised in U. This is
also referred to as the backward-looking center
or Ch. The notion of &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; for the purposes
of centering theory is most commonly defined
according to a hierarchy of grammatical roles:
SUBJECT &gt; DIRECT OBJECT &gt; INDIRECT OB-
JECT &gt; OTHERS (see e.g., Brennan et al 1987).
For alternative approaches see e.g., (Strube and
Hahn 1999), (Walker et al 1994).
2. There is a preference for consecutive ut-
terances within a discourse segment to keep the
same entity as the center, and for the center to
be realised as Subject or preferred center (Cp).
Kibble (1999) dubbed these principles cohe-
sion and salience respectively. Pairs of suc-
cessive utterances (Un,Un±i) are classified into
the transition types shown in Fig. 1, in the or-
der of preference specified by Grosz et al&apos;s &amp;quot;Rule
2&amp;quot;
3. The center is the entity which is most likely
to be pronominalised: Grosz et al&apos;s &amp;quot;Rule 1&amp;quot;
in its weakest form states that if any entity is
referred to by a pronoun. the Cb must be.
CONTINUE: cohesion and salience
both hold; same center (or
Cb(Un) undefined), realised as
Subject in Un+1;
RETAIN: cohesion only; i.e. center
remains the same but is not re-
alised as Subject in Un+1;
SMOOTH SHIFT: salience only; cen-
ter of Un+1 realised as Subject but
not equal to Cb(Un);
ROUGH SHIFT: neither cohesion nor
salience holds.
NO CB: this transition is used by
some researchers but is not dis-
cussed by GJW.

2.2 Pronominalisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9854032">
Text genres are known to vary in the extent
to which pronouns are used. The CT-based
framework allows us to experiment with differ-
ent strategies for choosing when to use a pro-
noun, including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998644555555556">
1. Never use anaphoric pronouns — for in-
stance, in certain legal documents or tech-
nical manuals where there must be no pos-
sibility of ambiguity.
2. Always pronominalise the Cb.
3. Use a pronoun for non-Cbs only if the Cb
is pronominalised.
4. Pronominalise the Cb only after a Continue
transition.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998342">
Strategy 3 is favoured by (GJW) who cite psy-
chological evidence that &amp;quot;the Cb is preferen-
tially realised by a pronoun in English and by
equivalent forms (i.e., _zero pronouns) in other
languages&amp;quot; (op cit., p. 214). However, in the
implementation reported in section 3 we opt for
the more restrictive strategy 4. The generation
approach outlined below enables us to experi-
ment with different strategies and compare the
resulting texts.

2.3 Centering and discourse structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999561222222222">
The canonical formulation of CT is concerned
with local cohesion,-specifying
tions between consecutive sentences in a dis-
course segment and favouring sequences which
maintain the same center. Our implementation
incorporates two extensions which have impli-
cations for more structured discourse: Strube
and Hahn&apos;s (1999) &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; principle, which
favours transitions that introduce a new topic
.in. .a salient position, and .Cristea&apos;s Veins The-
ory (Cristea et al 1998) which redefines tran-
sitions in terms of rhetorical hierarchy rather
than linear sequence of clauses (see section 3.3
for discussion).
&amp;quot;Cheapness&amp;quot; is satisfied by a transition pair
((Un-i, Un), (Um, Un+1)) if the preferred center
of Un is the Cb of Un+1. For example, this test
is satisfied by a RETAIN-SHIFT sequence but not
by CONTINUE-SHIFT, so it is predicted that the
former pattern will be used to introduce a new
center. (This claim is consistent with the find-
ings of Brennan 1998, Brennan et al 1987.) If we
consider examples la-e below, the sequence c-
d&apos;-e&apos;, including a RETAIN-SHIFT sequence, reads
more fluently than c-d-e even though the latter
scores better according to the canonical rank-
ing.

The &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; principle illustrates the need
for global optimisation. We noted above that
there is evidence that a RETAIN-SHIFT sequence
is the preferred way of introducing a new
center after a sequence of CONTINUE. How-
ever, in a sequence CONTINUE-RETAIN-SHIFT
the_sHIETths_.predicted,ituits _local &apos;context, but
the RETAIN is not; whenever RETAIN is a cheap
transition following CONTINUE, another CON-

is motivated as it enables a &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; SMOOTH
SHIFT, and so we need a way of evaluating the
whole sequence CONTINUE-RETAIN-SHIFT ver-

:244_ Centering in NLG
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99946876">
CT has developed primarily in the context of
natural language interpretation, focussing on
anaphora resolution (see e.g., Brennan et al
1987). Curiously, NLG researchers have tended
to overlook GJW&apos;s proposal that
Rule 2 provides a constraint on speak-
ers, and on natural-language gener-
ation systems ... To empirically test
the claim made by Rule 2 requires ex-
amination of differences in inference
load of alternative multi-utterance se-
quences that differentially realize the
same content.
GJW, p. 215.
With a few exceptions (e.g., Mittal et al 1998,
Kibble 1999, Kibble and Power 1999, Cheng
2000) NLG researchers have interpreted CT as
a theory of pronominalisation only (e.g., Dale
1992). In this paper we concentrate on plan-
ning, aiming to determine whether the prin-
ciples underlying the constraints and rules of
the theory can be &amp;quot;turned round&amp;quot; and used as
planning operators for generating coherent text.
Text planning in conformity with CT will need
to follow the following set of heuristics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.870404090909091">
1. Plan the order of clauses so that adjacent
clauses have at least one referent in com-
mon.
2. •Cohesion: Prefer orderings which main-
tain the same Cb in successive clauses.
. ..Realise as-Subject-of Un the
most grammatically salient entity in Un-1
which is mentioned in Ur, (the Cb).
4. Cheapness: Realise as Subject of Un an
entity which is mentioned in Un+i (and will
therefore be Cb of Uri+ 1 ).

<bodyText confidence="0.991501363636364">
Breaking down the problem like this reveals
that there are various ways the distinct tasks
can be slotted into an NLG system, ,Cohesion
naturally comes under Text Planning: ordering
a sequence of utterances to maintain the same
entity as the center, within constraints on order-
ing determined by discourse relations. However,
identifying the center depends on grammatical
salience, which is normally determined by the
Sentence Planner - for example, choice of active
or passive voice. Three possibilities are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955543821428571">
• &amp;quot;Incremental&amp;quot; sentence-by-sentence gener-
ation, where the syntactic structure of Un
is determined before the semantic content
of Un-f4 is planned. That is, the Text Plan-
ner would plan the content of Un+1 by aim-
ing to realise a proposition in the knowl-
edge base which mentions an entity which
is salient in U. We are not aware of any
system which performs all stages of gener-
ation in a sentence-by-sentence way, and in
any case this type of architecture would not
allow the cheapness principle to be imple-
mented as it would not support the neces-
sary forward planning.
• A pipelined system where the &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot; of a sentence is designated inde-
pendently as part of the semantic input,
and centering rules reflect the information
structure of a discourse. This approach
was suggested by Kibble (1999), proposing
that text and sentence planning should be
driven by the goal of realising the desig-
nated topic in positions where it will be
interpreted as the Cb. However, this is not
really a solution so much as a refinement of
the problem, since it simply shifts the prob-
lem of identifying the topic. Prince (1999)
notes that definitions of &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; in the liter-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.958045823529412">
ature do not provide objective tests for top-
ichood and proposes that the topic should
be identified with the centre of attention
as defined by CT; however, what would be
needed here would be a more fundamental
definition which would account for a par-
ticular entity being chosen to be the centre
of attention.
o The solution we adopt is to treat the task
of identifying Cbs as an optimisation prob-
lem. giving different weightings to the dif-
ferent transitions. We assume that certain
options for syntactic realisation can be pre-
,dicted MI ;the basis-of t he argument .struc-
ture of predicates, which means that cen-
tering transitions can be calculated as part
of Text Planning.

The text planner has been developed within
ICONOCLAST, a project which investigates ap-
plications of constraint-based reasoning in Nat-
ural Language Generation using as subject-
matter the domain of medical information
leaflets. Following (Scott and de Souza 1990),
we represent rhetorical structure by graphs like
figure 2, in which non-terminal nodes represent
RST relations, terminal nodes represent propo-
sitions, and linear order is unspecified. The task
of the text planner is to realize the rhetorical
structure as a text structure in which propo-
sitions are ordered, assigned to textual units
(e.g., sentences, paragraphs, vertical lists), and
linked where appropriate by discourse connec-
tives (e.g., &apos;since&apos;, &apos;however&apos;).
Even for a simple rhetorical input like figure 2
many reasonable text structures can be gener-
ated. Since there are two nucleus-satellite rela-
tions, the elementary propositions can be or-
dered in four ways; several discourse connec-
tives can be employed to realize each rhetor-
ical relation (e.g. concession can be realized
by &apos;although&apos;, &apos;but&apos; and &apos;however&apos;); at one ex-
treme, the text can be spread out over several
paragraphs, while at the other extreme it can
be squeezed into a single sentence. With fairly
restrictive constraint settings, the system gen-
erates 24 text-structure patterns for figure 2,
including the following (shown schematically):

<bodyText confidence="0.991075833333333">
The final output texts will depend on how the
propositions are realized syntactically; among
other things this will depend on centering
choices within each proposition.
In outline, the procedure that we propose is
as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997117">
1. Enumerate all text structures that are ac-
ceptable realizations of the rhetorical struc-
ture.
2. For each text structure, enumerate all per-
missible choices for the Cb and Cp of each
proposition.
3. Evaluate the solutions, taking account of
referential coherence among other consid-
erations, and choose the best.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961928571429">
For the example in figure 2, centers can be as-
signed in four ways for each text-structure pat-
tern, making a total of 96 solutions.
As will probably be obvious, such a procedure
could not be applied for rhetorical structures
with many propositions. For examples of this
kind, based on the relations &apos;cause&apos; and &apos;con-
cession&apos; (each of which can be marked by sev-
eral different connectives), we find that the to-
tal number of text-structures is approximately
5N-1 for N propositions. Hence with N = 4 we
would expect around 600 text structures; with
perhaps 5-10 ways of assigning centers to each
text structure, the total number of solutions
would approximate to 5000. Global optimiza-
tion of the solution therefore becomes imprac-
ticable for texts longer than about five propo-
sitions: we address this problem by a technique
of partial optimization in which a macro-planner
fixes the large-scale structure of the text, thus
defining a set of micro-planning problems each
small enough to be tackled by the methods de-
scribed here.
Stage 1 of the planning procedure is described
elsewhere (Power, 2000); we focus here on stages
2 and 3, in which the text planner enumerates
the possible assignments of centers and evalu-
ates which is the best.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9992">
3.1 Choosing centers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998403">
Given a text structure, we enumerate all per-
missible centering assignments as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.931164222222222">
1. Determine the predecessor Un_1 (if any) of
each proposition U.
2. List the potential Cbs and Cps of each
proposition, henceforth denoted by ECb
and ECp.
3. Compute all combinations from ECb and
ECp that respect the fundamental center-
ing constraint that Cb(Un) should be the
most salient candidate in Un-1.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9806725">
Two criteria for determining the predecessor
have been implemented; the user can select one
or other criterion, thus using the NLG system
to test different approaches. Following a linear
criterion, the predecessor is simply the propo-
sition that precedes the current proposition in
the text, regardless of structural considerations.
Following a hierarchical criterion, the predeces-
sor is the most accessible previous proposition,
in the sense defined by Veins Theory (Cristea et
al 1998). We will return to this issue later; for
now we assume the criterion is linear.
ECb(Uri) (potential Cbs of proposition Un) is
given by the intersection between C f (Un) and
C f (UnA — i.e., all the referents they have in
common. The potential Cps are those referents
in the current proposition that can be realized
as most salient. Obviously this should depend
on the linguistic resources available to the gen-
erator; the system actually uses a simpler rule
based on case roles within the proposition. Fig-
ure 3 shows the potential Cbs and Cps for the
proposition sequence in solution A.
Our treatment of salience here simplifies in
two ways. First, we assume that syntactic real-
ization serves only to distinguish the Cp from
all other referents, which are ranked on the
same level: thus effectively SUBJECT &gt; OTHERS.
Secondly, we assume that the system already
knows, from the event class .of the proposition,
which of its case roles can occur in subject po-
sition: thus for ban, both arguments are poten-
tial Cps because active and passive realizations
are both allowed; for contain, only elixir is a
potential Cp because we disallow &apos;Gestodene is
contained by Elixir&apos;.

With these simplifications, the enumeration
of centering assignments is straightforward; in
the above example, four combinations are pos-
sible, since there are two choices each for Cp(U2)
and Cp(U3), none of which leads to any viola-
tion of the basic centering constraint. This con-
straint only comes into play if there are several
choices for Cb(), one of which coincides with
Cp(Un--1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999876">
3.2 Evaluating solutions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99822530952381">
Various metrics could be used in order to eval-
uate centering choices. One possibility, for ex-
ample, would be to associate a cost with each
transition, so that perhaps &apos;Continue&apos; (the best
transition) has zero cost, while &apos;No Cb&apos; (the
worst transtion) has the highest cost. However,
we have preferred the approach mentioned ear-
lier in which cohesion and salience are evaluated
separately; this allows us to include the further
criterion of cheapness.
Although this paper focusses on centering is-
sues, it is important to remember that other as-
pects of text quality are evaluated at the same
time: the aim is to compute a global measure so
that disadvantages in one factor can be weighed
against advantages in another. For instance,
text pattern B is bound to yield poor continuity
of reference because it orders the propositions
so that U1 and U2 have no referents in com-
mon. Text pattern A avoids this defect, but
this does not necessarily mean that A is bet-
ter than B overall; there may be other reasons,
unconnected with centering, for preferring B to
A.
The system evaluates candidate solutions by
applying a battery of tests to each node of the
text plan. Each test identifies whether the node
suffers from a particular defect. For instance,
one stylistic defect (at least for the rhetorical
relations occurring in figure 2) is that of plac-
ing nucleus before satellite; in general, the text
reads better if important material is placed at
the end. For each type of defect, we specify a
weight indicating its importance: in evaluating
continuity of reference, for example, the defect
&apos;No Cb&apos; might be regarded as more significant
than other defects. Summing the weighted costs
for all defects, we obtain a total cost for the so-
lution; our aim is to find the solution with the
lowest total cost.
Regarding centering, the tests currently ap-
plied are as follows.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.921845">
Salience violation
A proposition Uri violates salience if
Cb(Uri) Cp(Uri). This defect is assessed
only on propositions that have a backward-
looking center.
Coherence violation
A proposition Un violates cohesion if
Cb(Un) Cb(Uii_i). Again, this defect is
not recorded when either Uri or Un..._1 has
no Cb.
Cheapness violation
A proposition Un violates cheapness if
Cb(U) Cp(Un-1)•

This defect is recorded for any proposition
with no Cb, except the first proposition in
the sequence (which by definition cannot
have a Cb).
Applied to the four solutions to text structure
A, with all weights equal to 1, these definitions
yield costs shown in Figure 4. According to our
metric, solutions Al and A2 should be preferred
to A3 and A4 because they incur less cost. This
result-can be assessed . by comparing the follow-
ing output texts, in which the generator has fol-

<bodyText confidence="0.946390114285714">
The linear approach, illustrated above, assigns
centers on the basis of a proposition sequence,
flattening the original hierarchy and ignoring
nucleus-satellite relations. This means, for ex-
ample, that in a text of two paragraphs, propo-
sition U21 (the first proposition in the second
paragraph) has to be treated as the successor
to ULN (the final proposition of the first para-
graph), even if LT1.,v is relatively insignificant
(the satellite of a satellite, perhaps). One&apos;s in-
tuition in such cases is that some more signif-
icant proposition in the first paragraph should
become the focus against which continuity of
reference in the second paragraph is judged.
Veins Theory (Cristea et al 1998) provides a
possible formalization of this intuition, in which
some earlier propositions become inaccessible as
a rhetorical boundary is crossed. The theory
could be applied to centering in various ways;
we have implemented perhaps the simplest ap-
proach, in which centering transitions are as-
sessed in relation to the nearest accessible prede-
cessor. In many cases the linear and hierarchical
definitions give the same result. but sometimes
they diverge, as in the following alternative to
solutions A and B:
C. ban( f da, elixir) since contain(elisir,
gestodene).
However, approve( f da, elixirplus).
Following Veins Theory, the predecessor of
approve( f da, elixirplus) is ban( f da, elixir); its
linear predecessor contain (elixir, gestodene)
(an embedded satellite) is inaccessible. This
makes a considerable difference: under a hier-
archical approach, fda can be the Cb of the

<bodyText confidence="0.99997378125">
This paper has highlighted some implications
of Centering Theory for planning coherent text.
We show that by making some assumptions
about which entities are potential Cps, we can
determine Cbs, Cps, and hence transitions, in
the text planning stage. This allows the text
planner to select the proposition sequence that
yields the best continuity of reference, or to bal-
ance the goal of referential continuity against
other factors. For instance, there may be a
preference for Satellite to follow Nucleus for
some discourse relations, even if this results in a
greater number of defects according to centering
considerations. There are difficulties in evaluat-
ing algorithms for specific tasks which are em-
bedded in a generation system, since the quality
of the output is limited by the functionalities of
the system as a whole. In particular, the task
of generating appropriate referring expressions
cannot be tackled in isolation from other tasks
which contribute to the coherence of a text.
The implementation of Centering reported
here is a special case of text planning by con-
straint satisfaction, where the user has control
over the different constraints, and this approach
means that different strategies for e.g. clause or-
dering and pronominalisation can easily be com-
pared by inspecting the resulting texts. The
evaluation metrics we have presented here are
provisional and are a matter for further detailed
research, which our approach to text generation
will facilitate.

Our implementation incorporates two extensions which have implications for more structured discourse: Strube and Hahn&apos;s (1999) &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; principle, which favours transitions that introduce a new topic .in. .a salient position, and .Cristea&apos;s Veins Theory (Cristea et al 1998) which redefines transitions in terms of rhetorical hierarchy rather than linear sequence of clauses (see section 3.3 for discussion). &amp;quot;Cheapness&amp;quot; is satisfied by a transition pair ((Un-i, Un), (Um, Un+1)) if the preferred center of Un is the Cb of Un+1.

Two criteria for determining the predecessor have been implemented; the user can select one or other criterion, thus using the NLG system to test different approaches. Following a linear criterion, the predecessor is simply the proposition that precedes the current proposition in the text, regardless of structural considerations. Following a hierarchical criterion, the predecessor is the most accessible previous proposition, in the sense defined by Veins Theory (Cristea et al 1998). We will return to this issue later; for now we assume the criterion is linear. ECb(Uri) (potential Cbs of proposition Un) is given by the intersection between C f (Un) and C f (UnA — i.e., all the referents they have in common. The potential Cps are those referents in the current proposition that can be realized as most salient. Obviously this should depend on the linguistic resources available to the generator; the system actually uses a simpler rule based on case roles within the proposition. Figure 3 shows the potential Cbs and Cps for the proposition sequence in solution A. Our treatment</context>

This approach was suggested by Kibble (1999), proposing that text and sentence planning should be driven by the goal of realising the designated topic in positions where it will be interpreted as the Cb. However, this is not really a solution so much as a refinement of the problem, since it simply shifts the problem of identifying the topic. Prince (1999) notes that definitions of &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; in the literature do not provide objective tests for topichood and proposes that the topic should be identified with the centre of attention as defined by CT; however, what would be needed here would be a more fundamental definition which would account</context>

This structure only partially constrains the linear order in which the propositions will be realised — in other words, any RST structure specifies a range of possible text plans. We propose as an additional constraint that the generator should seek to maximise continuity of reference as determined by centering theory, and we argue that this enables us to select the most cohesive variants from a set of text plans.

Generating coherent texts according to centering theory is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem. 1 Introduction 1.1 Issues in pronoun generation The appropriate realisation of anaphoric expressions is a long-standing problem in NLG research. However, as McCoy and Strube (1999) observe, few researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms for pronoun generation. A typical approach, exemplified by Dale (1993), Reiter and Dale (1997) is to pronominalise some distinguished referent which was mentioned in the previous sentence according to a domaindependent criterion of prominence or salience. McCoy and Strube (op cit.) offer a more complex algorithm based on the notion of &amp;quot;discourse threads&amp;quot;, for which they report an accuracy of 85% when tested against a corpus of naturally-occurring texts.

Plan the order of clauses so that adjacent clauses have at least one referent in common. 2. •Cohesion: Prefer orderings which maintain the same Cb</context>

Global optimization of the solution therefore becomes impracticable for texts longer than about five propositions: we address this problem by a technique of partial optimization in which a macro-planner fixes the large-scale structure of the text, thus defining a set of micro-planning problems each small enough to be tackled by the methods described here. Stage 1 of the planning procedure is described elsewhere (Power, 2000); we focus here on stages 2 and 3, in which the text planner enumerates the possible assignments of centers and evaluates which is the best. 3.1 Choosing centers Given a text structure, we enumerate all permissible centering assignments as follows: 1. Determine the predecessor Un_1 (if any) of each proposition U. 2. List the potential Cbs and Cps of each proposition, henceforth denoted by ECb and ECp. 3. Compute all combinations from ECb and ECp that respect the fundamental centering constraint that Cb(Un) should be the most salient candidate in Un-1. Two criteria for determining the predecess</context>

This approach was suggested by Kibble (1999), proposing that text and sentence planning should be driven by the goal of realising the designated topic in positions where it will be interpreted as the Cb. However, this is not really a solution so much as a refinement of the problem, since it simply shifts the problem of identifying the topic. Prince (1999) notes that definitions of &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; in the literature do not provide objective tests for topichood and proposes that the topic should be identified with the centre of attention as defined by CT; however, what would be needed here would be a more fundamental definition which would account for a particular entity being chosen to be the centre of attention. o The solution we adopt is to treat the task of identifying Cbs as an optimisation problem. giving different weightings to the different transitions.

Centering theory provides the basis for such an integrated approach. Generating coherent texts according to centering theory is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem. 1 Introduction 1.1 Issues in pronoun generation The appropriate realisation of anaphoric expressions is a long-standing problem in NLG research. However, as McCoy and Strube (1999) observe, few researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms for pronoun generation. A typical approach, exemplified by Dale (1993), Reiter and Dale (1997) is to pronominalise some distinguished referent which was mentioned in the previous sentence according to a domaindependent criterion of prominence or salience. McCoy and Strube (op cit.) offer a more complex algorithm based on the notion of &amp;quot;discourse threads&amp;quot;, for which they report an accuracy of 85% when tested against a corpus of naturally-occurring texts. Their approach makes some fundamental assumptions about discourse structure which appear to be beyond the capabilities of current text and sentence planners and are incompatible with the widelyaccepted notion of discourse structure as a</context>

For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity which is the centre of attention or center. The center in an utterance Un is the most grammatically salient entity realised in Un_1 which is also realised in U. This is also referred to as the backward-looking center or Ch. The notion of &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; for the purposes of centering theory is most commonly defined according to a hierarchy of grammatical roles: SUBJECT &gt; DIRECT OBJECT &gt; INDIRECT OBJECT &gt; OTHERS (see e.g., Brennan et al 1987). For alternative approaches see e.g., (Strube and Hahn 1999), (Walker et al 1994). 2. There is a preference for consecutive utterances within a discourse segment to keep the same entity as the center, and for the center to be realised as Subject or preferred center (Cp). Kibble (1999) dubbed these principles cohesion and salience respectively. Pairs of successive utterances (Un,Un±i) are classified into the transition types shown in Fig. 1, in the order of preference specified by Grosz et al&apos;s &amp;quot;Rule 2&amp;quot; 3. The center is the entity which is most likely to be pronominalised: Grosz et al&apos;s &amp;quot;Rule 1&amp;quot; in its weakest form states that if any entity is referred </context>
