The continuous expansion of the multilingual
information society has led in recent years to a pressing
demand for multilingual linguistic resources suitable to
be used for different applications.
In this paper we present the WordNet Domains
Hierarchy (WDH), a language-independent resource
composed of 164, hierarchically organized, domain
labels (e.g. Architecture, Sport, Medicine). Although
WDH has been successfully applied to various Natural
Language Processing tasks, the first available version
presented some problems, mostly related to the lack of a
clear semantics of the domain labels. Other correlated
issues were the coverage and the balancing of the
domains. We illustrate a new version of WDH
addressing these problems by an explicit and systematic
reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification. The new
version of WDH has a better defined semantics and is
applicable to a wider range of tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.99990598540146">
The continuous expansion of the multilingual
information society with a growing number of new
languages present on the Web has led in recent
years to a pressing demand for multilingual
applications. To support such applications,
multilingual language resources are needed, which
however require a lot of human effort to be built.
For this reason, the development of language-
independent resources which factorize what is
common to many languages, and are possibly
linked to the language-specific resources, could
bring great advantages to the development of the
multilingual information society.
A language-independent resource, usable in
many automatic and human applications, is
represented by domain hierarchies. The notion of
domain is related to similar notions such as
semantic field, subject matter, broad topic, subject
code, subject domain, category. These notions are
used, sometimes interchangeably, sometimes with
significant distinctions, in various fields such as
linguistics, lexicography, cataloguing, text
categorization. As far as this work is concerned,
we define a domain as an area of knowledge which
is somehow recognized as unitary. A domain can
be characterized by the name of a discipline where
a certain knowledge area is developed (e.g.
chemistry) or by the specific object of the
knowledge area (e.g. food). Although objects of
knowledge and disciplines that study them are
clearly related, the relation between these two
points of view on domains is sometimes blurred
and may be a source of uncertainty on their exact
definition.
Another interesting duality when speaking about
domains is related to the fact that knowledge
manifests itself in both words and texts. So the
notion of domain can be applied both to the study
of words, where a domain is the area of knowledge
to which a certain lexical concept belongs, or to the
study of texts, where the domain of a text is its
broad topic. In this work we will assume that also
these two points of view on domains are strictly
intertwined.
By their nature, domains can be organized in
hierarchies based on a relation of specificity. For
instance we can say that TENNIS is a more specific
domain than SPORT, or that ARCHITECTURE is more
general than TOWN PLANNING.
Domain hierarchies can be usefully integrated
into other linguistic resources and are also
profitably used in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks such as Word Sense
Disambiguation (Magnini et al. 2002), Text
Categorization (Schutze, 1998), Information
Retrieval (Walker and Amsler, 1986).
As regards the usage of Domain hierarchies in
the field of multilingual lexicography, an example
is given by the EuroWordNet Domain-ontology, a
language independent domain hierarchy to which
interlingual concepts (ILI-records) can be assigned
(Vossen, 1998). In the same line, see also the
SIMPLE domain hierarchy (SIMPLE, 2000).
Large domain hierarchies are also available on
the Internet, mainly meant for classifying web
documents. See for instance the Google and Yahoo
directories.
A large-scale application of a domain hierarchy
to a lexicon is represented by WORDNET DOMAINS
(Magnini and Cavaglià, 2000). WORDNET
DOMAINS is a lexical resource developed at ITC-
irst where each WordNet synset (Fellbaum, 1998)
is annotated with one or more domain labels
selected from a domain hierarchy which was
specifically created to this purpose. As the
WORDNET DOMAINS Hierarchy (WDH) is
language-independent, it has been possible to
exploit it in the framework of MultiWordNet
(Pianta et al., 2002), a multilingual lexical database
developed at ITC-irst in which the Italian
component is strictly aligned with the English
WordNet. In MultiWordNet, the domain
information has been automatically transferred
from English to Italian, resulting in a Italian
version of WORDNET DOMAINS. For instance, as
the English synset {court, tribunal, judicature} was
annotated with the domain LAW, also the Italian
synset {corte, tribunale}, which is aligned with the
corresponding English synset, results automatically
annotated with the LAW domain. This procedure
can be applied to any other WordNet (or part of it)
aligned with Princeton WordNet (see for instance
the Spanish WordNet).
It is worth noticing that two of the main on-
going projects addressing the construction of
multilingual resources, that is MEANING (Rigau
et al. 2002) and BALKANET (see web site), make
use of WORDNET DOMAINS. Finally, WORDNET
DOMAINS is being profitably used by the NLP
community mainly for Word Sense
Disambiguation tasks in various languages.
Another application of domain hierarchies can
be found in the field of corpus creation. In many
existing corpora (see for instance the BNC, the
ANC, the Brown and LOB Corpora) domain is one
of the most used criteria for text selection and/or
classification. Given that a domain hierarchy is
language independent, if the same domain
hierarchy is used to build reference corpora for
different languages, then it would be easy to create
(a first approximation of) comparable corpora by
putting in correspondence corpora sections
belonging to the same domain.
An example of a corpus in which the complete
representation of domains is pursued in a
systematic way is represented by the MEANING
Italian corpus, a large size corpus of written
contemporary Italian in which a subset of the
WDH labels has been chosen as the fundamental
criterion for the selection of the texts to be
included in the corpus (Bentivogli et al., 2003).
Given the relevance of language-independent
domain hierarchies for multilingual applications, it
is of primary importance that these resources have
a well-defined semantics and structure in order to
be useful in various application fields. This paper
reports the work done to improve the WDH so that
it complies with such requirements. In particular,
the WDH revision has been carried out with
reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
briefly introduces the WORDNET DOMAINS
Hierarchy and its main characteristics, with a short
overview of the Dewey Decimal Classification
system. Section 3 describes features and properties
of the revision. Finally, in section 4, conclusions
are reported.

2 The WordNet Domains Hierarchy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992343363636364">
The first version of the WDH was composed of
164 domain labels selected starting from the
subject field codes used in current dictionaries, and
the subject codes contained in the Dewey Decimal
Classification (DDC), a general knowledge
organization tool which is the most widely used
taxonomy for library organization purposes.
Domain labels were organized in five main trees,
reaching a maximum depth of four. Figure 1 shows
a fragment of one of the five main trees in the
WORDNET DOMAINS original hierarchy.

Domain labels were initially conceived to be
application-oriented, that is, they have been
integrated in WordNet with the main purpose of
allowing the categorization of word senses and to
provide useful information during the
disambiguation process.
The second level of WDH, where the so-called
Basic Domains are represented, includes labels
such as ART, SPORT, RELIGION and HISTORY,
while in the third level a degree of major
specialization is reproduced, and domains, like for
example, DRAWING, PAINTING, TENNIS,
VOLLEYBALL, and ARCHAEOLOGY can be found. For
NLP tasks, the set of Basic Domains has proved to
possess a suitable level of abstraction and
granularity.
Although the first version of WDH found many
applications in different scenarios, it presented
some problems. First, the domain labels did not
have a defined semantics. The content of the labels

could be suggested by the lexical meaning of their
name, but there was no explicit indication about
their intended interpretation.
Second, it was not clear whether the Basic
Domains met certain requirements such as
knowledge coverage and balancing. In fact, the
Basic Domains are supposed to possess a
comparable degree of granularity and, at the same
time, to cover all human knowledge. However,
they did not always posses such characteristics. For
instance VETERINARY was put at the same level as
ECONOMY, although these two domains obviously
do not posses the same level of granularity.
Moreover not all branches of human knowledge
were represented (see for instance the HOME
domain).
The purpose of the work presented here was,
therefore, to find a solution for such problems, in
order to improve the applicability of WDH in a
wider range of fields. The solution we propose is
crucially based on the Dewey Decimal
Classification (edition 21), which has been used as
a reference point for defining a clear semantics,
preventing overlapping among domains, and
assessing the Basic Domains coverage and
granularity issues.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981997">
2.1 The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931111111111">
The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system
(Mitchell et al. 1996) is the most widely used
taxonomy for library classification purposes
providing a logical system for the organization of
every item of knowledge through well-defined
subject codes hierarchically organized. The
semantics of each subject code is determined by a
numeric code, a short lexical description associated
to it, and by the hierarchical relations with the
other subject codes. Another characteristic of the
DDC is that a handbook is available explaining
how texts should be classified under subject codes.
The DDC is not just for organizing book
collections; it has also been licensed for
cataloguing internet resources (see for example
BUBL http://bubl.ac.uk/link/) and it was conceived
to accommodate the expansion and evolution of
the body of human knowledge.
The DDC hierarchy is arranged by disciplines
(or fields of study), and this entails that a subject
may appear in more than one discipline, depending
on the aspect of the topic discussed.
The DDC hierarchical structure allows a topic to
be defined as part of the broader topic above it, and
that determines the meaning of the class and its
relation to other classes. At the broadest level,
called Main Classes (or First summary), the DDC
is composed of ten mutually exclusive main
classes, which together cover the entire world of
knowledge. Each main class is sub-divided into ten
divisions, (the Hundred Divisions, or Second
Summary) and each division is split into ten
sections (the Thousand Section, also called Third
Summary).
Each category in the DDC is represented by a
numeric code as the example below shows.

The first digit of the numbers indicates the main
class, (700 is used for all Arts) the second digit
indicates the hundred division, (730 corresponds to
Plastic arts, 740 to Drawing, 750 to Painting) and
the third digit indicates the section (736 represents
Carving, 738 Ceramic arts, 739 Art metalwork).
Moreover, almost all sub-classes are further
subdivided. A decimal point follows the third digit
until the degree of specification needed (736.23
Diamonds, 736.25 Sapphires).

In many cases we found a one-to-one mapping
between a WDH label and a DDC code (e.g.
PAINTING mapped onto 750 or CINEMA onto
791.43). When one-to-one mappings were not
found, artificial DDC codes were created. An
artificial code, represented within square brackets,
is created with reference to various DDC codes or
parts of them. To describe artificial nodes, certain
conventions have been adopted.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988795333333333">
(i) A series of non-consecutive codes is listed
separated by a comma (see DANCE).
(ii) A series of consecutive codes is indicated by a
range. For instance, the series [731, 732, 733, 734,
735] is abbreviated as [731:735] (see SCULPTURE).
(iii) A part of a tree is represented as the difference
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979953264705883">
between a tree and one or more of its subtrees,
where the tree and the subtrees are identified by
their roots (see DRAWING).
(iv) The square brackets should be interpreted as
meaning “the generalities” of the composition of
codes contained in the brackets. So, for instance,
[731:735] should be interpreted as the generalities
of the codes going from 731 to 735. In the original
DDC, generalities are identified by the 0 decimal.
For instance, the code 700 refers to the generalities
of the codes from 710 to 790.
To establish a mapping between labels and codes
we exploited the names of the DDC categories and
their description in the DDC manual. This worked
pretty well in most cases, but there are some
exceptions. Take for instance the TOURISM domain.
Apparently tourism does not occur as a category in
the DDC. On a closer inspection it came out that
the categories which are most clearly related to
tourism are 910.202:World travel guides and
910.4:Accounts of travel.
Note that a WDH domain can be mapped onto
codes included in different DDC main classes, i.e.
disciplines. For example ARTISANSHIP
(745.5:Handicrafts, 338.642:Small business) maps
onto categories located partly under 700:Art and
partly under 300:Social Sciences. The same
happens with SEXUALITY, a domain that following
the DDC is studied by many different disciplines,
e.g. philosophy, medicine, psychology, body care.
As a consequence of the systematic specification
of the semantics of the WDH domains, some of
them have been re-labeled with regard to the
previous version of the hierarchy. For instance, the
domain BOTANY has been changed to PLANTS,
ZOOLOGY to ANIMALS, and ALIMENTATION to FOOD.
This change of focus from the name of the
discipline to the name of the object of the
discipline is not only in compliance with the new
edition of the DDC, but it also reflects current and
international usage (see, for example, Google
categories). In some cases the change of the
domain name comes along with a change of its
intended interpretation. For instance, we have
decided to enlarge the semantics of the domain
ZOOTECHNICS and to call it ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, a
more generic domain which was missing in the
previous hierarchy.
In most cases the hierarchical relations between
the WDH domains are the same as the relations
holding between the corresponding DDC codes:
MUSIC is more specific than ART in the same way
as 780:Music is more specific than 700:The Arts.
To reinforce the hierarchical parallelism between
the WDH and the DCC, we re-located some
domains with regard to the previous WDH
hierarchy. For example, OCCULTISM, which was
placed under RELIGION in the old hierarchy, has
been moved under the newly created domain
PARANORMAL. Also, TOPOGRAPHY, previously placed
under ASTRONOMY, has now been moved under
GEOGRAPHY.
In a few cases however we did not respect the
hierarchical relations specified by the DDC, as in
the case of the ARCHITECTURE domain shown in
Table 2. ARCHITECTURE has been mapped onto
720:Architecture and TOWN PLANNING onto
710:Civic &amp; landscape art.

<tableCaption confidence="0.999558">

<bodyText confidence="0.9754565">
However, whereas the 710 code is sibling of 720
in the DDC, TOWN PLANNING is child of
ARCHITECTURE in WDH. Also, ARCHITECTURE and
TOWN PLANNING should be under ART according to
the DDC, but they have been placed under
APPLIED SCIENCE in WDH.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996507">
3.2 Disjunction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821846153846">
This property requires that no DDC code is
associated to more than one WDH label. In only
one case this requirement has not been met.
Apparently, the DDC does not distinguish between
the disciplines of Sociology and Anthropology,
and reserves the codes that go from 301 to 307 to
both of them. Although these two disciplines are
strictly connected, it seems to us that in the current
practice they are considered as distinct. So the
WDH contains two distinct domains for
SOCIOLOGY and ANTHROPOLOGY, which partially
overlap because they both map onto the same DDC
codes 301:307.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999112">
3.3 Basic Coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997220875">
The term basic coverage refers to the ideal
requirement that all human knowledge be covered
by the totality of the Basic Domains (i.e. the
domains composing the second level of WDH).
Also in this case, we used the DDC as a gold
standard to measure the coverage of WDH. Given
the fact that the DDC has been used for more than
a century to classify books and written documents
all over the world, we can assume that the DDC
guarantees a complete representation of all
branches of knowledge. So the basic coverage has
been manually checked by verifying that all (or
almost all) the DDC categories can be assigned to
at least one Basic Domain.
From a practical point of view, it would be very
complicated to check all the thousands of codes
contained in the DDC. Thus, our check relied on
two assumptions. First, when the Basic Domains
are taken as a stand alone set, the semantics of a
Basic Domain is given by its specific code together
with the codes of its subdomains. Second, once a
DDC code is covered by a Basic Domain,
inductively, all the more specific categories are
covered as well. These assumptions allowed us to
actually check only the topmost DDC codes. For
example, let’s take the 300 main class of the DDC.
Table 3 below shows that all the sub-codes of the
300 class are covered by one or more domains.
In order to improve the overall WDH coverage,
5 completely new domains have been introduced
(the first three are Basic): PARANORMAL, HOME,
HEALTH, FINANCE and GRAPHIC ARTS.

We can now assume that the domain-coverage of
the new version of WDH is almost equivalent to
that of the DDC, thus ensuring the complete
representation of all branches of knowledge.
The new WDH allowed us to fix a number of
synset classifications that were unsatisfactory in
the previous version of WORDNET DOMAINS. For
instance, in the first version of WORDNET
DOMAINS the English/Italian synset {microwave
oven, microwave}/{forno a microonde,
microonde} was annotated with the FURNITURE
domain, while the synset {detergent}/{detersivo}
was annotated with FACTOTUM (i.e. no specific
domain) as no better solution was available. The
new WDH hierarchy allows for a more appropriate
classification of both synsets within the new HOME
domain.
A few DDC codes are not covered by the new
list of domains either. These are the codes under
the 000:Generalities class which includes
disciplines such as 010:Bibliography, 020:Library
&amp; information sciences, 030:Encyclopedic works,
080:General collections. This section has been
specifically created for cataloguing general and
encyclopedic works and collections. So it is a
idiosyncratic category which is not based on
subject but on the genre of texts.
Another set of codes which remains not covered
by WDH are those going from 420 to 490 and from
810 to 890. These DDC codes are devoted to
specific languages and literatures of different
countries, for example, 430:Germanic Languages,
440:Romance Languages, 810:American Literature
in English, etc. These codes are undoubtedly
relevant for the classification of books, but are not
compatible with the rationale of WDH, which is
meant to be a language-independent resource.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99872">
3.4 Basic Balancing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998710423611112">
The requirement about basic balancing is meant to
assure that all Basic Domains have a comparable
degree of granularity.
Defining a granularity metrics for domains is a
complex issue, for which only a tentative solution
is provided here. At a first glance, three aspects
could be taken into consideration: the number of
publications about a domain, the number of sub-
codes in the DDC, and the relevance of a domain
in the social life.
As a first attempt, balancing could be evaluated
referring to the number of publications classified
under each Basic Domain. In fact, data are
available about the number of texts classified
under each of the DDC codes. Unfortunately, the
number of books published under a certain
category may not be indicative of its social
relevance: very specialized domains may include a
high number of publications, which however
circulate in a restricted circle, with low social
impact. For example, the number of texts classified
in the History domain turns out to be more then ten
times the number of texts catalogued under the
Computer Science domain. However, if one looks
at the number of HTML pages available on the
Internet, or the number of magazines sold in a
newspaper stand, or the number of terms used in
everyday life, one cannot maintain that History is
ten times more relevant than Computer Science.
Another approach for evaluating the granularity
of domains could be to take into account the
number of DDC sub-codes corresponding to each
Basic Domain. Unfortunately, also this approach
gives results which are far from being satisfactory.
The fact that a discipline has many subdivisions
seems not to be clearly correlated with its
relevance. For instance in the DDC manual
(version 21) 105 pages can be put in
correspondence with the ENGINEERING domain,
whereas only 26 correspond to SPORT. It should
also be said that there is no correlation between the
number of publications and the number of sub-
categories in the DDC. For instance,
ARCHITECTURE has a great number of publications
classified under it, but on the contrary, the number
of sub-categories in the DDC is very limited.
The third criterion to evaluate the granularity of
domains is their social relevance, which seems not
to be captured adequately by the previous two
criteria. Of course, social relevance is very difficult
to evaluate. We tentatively took into consideration
the organization of Internet hierarchies such as the
Google and Yahoo directories, which seem to be
closer than the DDC to represent the current social
relevance of certain domains. See for instance the
huge number of HTML pages classified in Google
under the topic Television Programs. Of course
Internet is only a partial view of the organization
of human knowledge, so we cannot simply rely on
the Internet to evaluate the granularity of the
domains.
None of the approaches analyzed so far seems to
fit our needs. Thus we took into consideration a
fourth criterion, which is based on the DDC as
well. Instead of counting the number of
subdivisions under a certain DDC code, we
measured the depth of the code from the top of the
hierarchy. For instance we can say that 700:Art has
depth 1, 780:Music has depth 2, 782:Vocal Music
has depth 3, and so on. We make the assumption
that two DDC codes with the same depth have the
same granularity. For instance we assume that
782:Vocal Music and 382:Foreign Trade have the
same granularity (both have depth 3).
In order to evaluate the granularity of the Basic
Domains against the DDC, we can compare WDH
labels and DDC codes with the same depth. Given
that the Basic Domains have depth 2, we should
compare them to the so called Hundred Divisions
(000, 010, 020, 030, ..., 100, 110, 120, etc.).
Summing up, we will say that the Basic Domains
are balanced if they can all be mapped onto the
Hundred Divisions. Also, in the comparison we
should take into account that the Basic Domains
are 45, whereas the Hundred Divisions are 100. So,
we expect that in the average, one Basic Domain
maps onto two Hundred Divisions with a small
degree of variance with respect to the average.
What we have obtained from the analysis of the
new WDH is the following: out of 45 Basic
Domains
o 4 domains map onto a Main Class (depth 1)
o 18 domains are mapped at the Hundred
Divisions level (depth 2)
o 6 domains are mapped at different DDC levels,
with the majority of DDC codes at depth 2
o 17 domains map onto subdivisions of depth 3
and 4.
As for the average number of DDC codes
covered by each Basic Domain, the variance is
quite high. Certain Basic Domains cover a big
number of codes from the Hundred Divisions. For
instance HISTORY, and ART cover 6 codes each.
Instead, in most cases, one Basic Domain covers
only one DDC code (e.g. LAW and 340:Law).
The evaluation of the granularity of the Basic
Domains according to the proposed criterion can
be considered satisfactory even if the results
diverge somewhat from what expected in principle.
To explain this partial divergence in the
granularity of domains, one should take into
consideration that the DDC has been created
relying heavily on the academic organization of
knowledge disciplines. On the other side, in the
practical WDH reorganization process we tried to
balance somehow this discipline-oriented
approach, by taking into account also the social
relevance of domains. This has been done by
relying on the organization of Internet directories
and on our personal intuitions.
Such an approach led us to put at the Basic level
WDH labels corresponding to DDC codes with
depth higher than 2 (more specific than the
Hundreds Divisions). See for instance the
positioning of RADIO+TV, FOOD, HEALTH, and
ENVIRONMENT at the Basic level, even if they
correspond to DDC codes of level 3 and 4.
Instead, ANIMALS and PLANTS were not Basic in
the previous version of WDH, but have been
promoted to the Basic level in accordance with the
granularity level they have in the DDC.
Other domain labels have been placed at a lower
level then expected with reference to the DDC. For
instance PHILOSOPHY, ART, RELIGION, and
LITERATURE have been put at the Basic Level,
even if they correspond to DDC codes belonging to
the Main Classes (depth 1). On the other side
ASTROLOGY, ARCHAEOLOGY, BODY CARE, and
VETERINARY which were Basic in the previous
version of the WDH, have been demoted at a lower
level in accordance with the granularity they have
in the DDC. Only in one case this process of
demotion has led to the elimination of a sub-
domain, that is TEXTILE.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99939156">
In this paper we described the revision of the
WORDNET DOMAINS Hierarchy (WDH), with the
aim of providing it with a clear semantics, and
evaluating the coverage and balancing of a subset
of the WDH, called Basic Domains. This has been
done mostly by relying on the information
available in the Dewy Decimal Classification
(DDC). A semantics has been provided to the
WDH labels by defining one or more pointers to
DDC codes. The coverage of the Basic Domains
has been evaluated by checking that each DDC
code is covered by at least one Basic Domain.
Finally, balancing has been evaluated mostly by
comparing the granularity of the Basic Domains
with the granularity of a subset of the DDC called
the Hundred Divisions. Balancing is the aspect of
the Basic Domains which diverges more clearly
from the DDC. This is explained by the fact that
we took in higher consideration the social
relevance of domains.
We think that the new version of the WDH is
better suited to act as a useful language-
independent resource in the fields of computational
lexicography, corpus building, and various NLP
applications.

<abstract confidence="0.999290578947368">The continuous expansion of the multilingual information society has led in recent years to a pressing demand for multilingual linguistic resources suitable to be used for different applications. In this paper we present the WordNet Domains Hierarchy (WDH), a language-independent resource composed of 164, hierarchically organized, domain labels (e.g. Architecture, Sport, Medicine). Although WDH has been successfully applied to various Natural Language Processing tasks, the first available version presented some problems, mostly related to the lack of a clear semantics of the domain labels. Other correlated issues were the coverage and the balancing of the domains. We illustrate a new version of WDH addressing these problems by an explicit and systematic reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification. The new version of WDH has a better defined semantics and is applicable to a wider range of tasks.</abstract>

An example of a corpus in which the complete representation of domains is pursued in a systematic way is represented by the MEANING Italian corpus, a large size corpus of written contemporary Italian in which a subset of the WDH labels has been chosen as the fundamental criterion for the selection of the texts to be included in the corpus (Bentivogli et al., 2003). Given the relevance of language-independent domain hierarchies for multilingual applications, it is of primary importance that these resources have a well-defined semantics and structure in order to be useful in various application fields.

The purpose of the work presented here was, therefore, to find a solution for such problems, in order to improve the applicability of WDH in a wider range of fields. The solution we propose is crucially based on the Dewey Decimal Classification (edition 21), which has been used as a reference point for defining a clear semantics, preventing overlapping among domains, and assessing the Basic Domains coverage and granularity issues. 2.1 The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system (Mitchell et al. 1996) is the most widely used taxonomy for library classification purposes providing a logical system for the organization of every item of knowledge through well-defined subject codes hierarchically organized. The semantics of each subject code is determined by a numeric code, a short lexical description associated to it, and by the hierarchical relations with the other subject codes. Another characteristic of the DDC is that a handbook is available explaining how texts should be classified under subject codes. The DDC is not just for organizing book collections; it has also been licensed for cata</context>

Finally, WORDNET DOMAINS is being profitably used by the NLP community mainly for Word Sense Disambiguation tasks in various languages. Another application of domain hierarchies can be found in the field of corpus creation. In many existing corpora (see for instance the BNC, the ANC, the Brown and LOB Corpora) domain is one of the most used criteria for text selection and/or classification.

WORDNET DOMAINS is a lexical resource developed at ITCirst where each WordNet synset (Fellbaum, 1998) is annotated with one or more domain labels selected from a domain hierarchy which was specifically created to this purpose.

In this work we will assume that also these two points of view on domains are strictly intertwined. By their nature, domains can be organized in hierarchies based on a relation of specificity. For instance we can say that TENNIS is a more specific domain than SPORT, or that ARCHITECTURE is more general than TOWN PLANNING. Domain hierarchies can be usefully integrated into other linguistic resources and are also profitably used in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini et al. 2002), Text Categorization (Schutze, 1998), Information Retrieval (Walker and Amsler, 1986). As regards the usage of Domain hierarchies in the field of multilingual lexicography, an example is given by the EuroWordNet Domain-ontology, a language independent domain hierarchy to which interlingual concepts (ILI-records) can be assigned (Vossen, 1998).
