In this paper&apos; I describe the use
of Danish pronouns and deictics
in dialogues. Then I present an
adaptation to Danish of Eckert
and Strube&apos;s algorithm for resolv-
ing anaphora referring to individ-
ual NPs and abstract objects in En-
glish dialogues (Eckert and Strube,

The adapted algorithm is tested on
four Danish dialogues from two dia-

<bodyText confidence="0.999317781818182">
Many natural language processing applica-
tions involve the complex task of resolving
anaphora. Different strategies for anaphora
resolution have been proposed, some exclu-
sively relying on the syntactic structure of
discourse, some including semantic and prag-
matic constraints, some based on statisti-
cal methods. One of the most popular ap-
proaches to anaphora resolution is center-
ing (Grosz et al., 1995), henceforth GJW95,
which accounts for the relation between the
saliency of entities in discourse and the use
of referring expressions, incorporating syn-
tax, semantics and pragmatics. Centering fits
into Grosz and Sidner&apos;s model of discourse
structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). In this
model a discourse is composed of segments
which exhibit global coherence. A discourse
&apos;This work has been carried out under Staging,
an on-going Danish project funded by the Danish Re-
search Councils.
segment, on the other hand, is composed of
a sequence of utterances which exhibit local
coherence. This latter phenomenon is ac-
counted for by centering theory. Centering
predicts that there is a connection between
the coherence of a referring expression and
the inference load necessary to resolve it. Al-
though Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein recognize
that many factors determine the prominence
of entities in an utterance, in GJW95 this
prominence is established simply by the linear
order of the entities in the utterance. Differ-
ent centering algorithms have been presented,
spelling out the strategy described in GJW95,
extending the theory to more linguistic phe-
nomena or specifying the concept of promi-
nence of discourse entities. Strube and Hahn
(Strube, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999) in par-
ticular, calculate prominence considering the
information structure of the utterances (func-
tional centering) .2 The prominence ranking
they adopt does not exclusively rely on word
order, which is language dependent. More-
over GJW95 only dealt with intersentential
anaphora, while Strube and Hahn account
for both intrasentential and intersentential,
pronominal and nominal anaphora.3
Centering-based algorithms have been
tested on written texts. Recently they have
also been applied to written dialogues. Byron
and Stent (1998), in particular, test center-
ing on multi-party dialogues. They conclude
that centering seems to be a valid theory also
in this case, but it must be extended to ac-

prominence ranking has been proposed.

to intrasentential anaphora has been proposed by
Kameyama (1998).

count for dialogue-specific aspects such as the
definition of utterance boundaries, the speci-
fication of a strategy for tackling partial ut-
terances and including discourse participants
in the list of relevant discourse entities.
Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), hence-
forth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolv-
ing anaphors referring to individual NPs and
abstract objects in English dialogues. The al-
gorithm is based on rules for discriminating
among the two types of anaphor based on the
predicative contexts in which the anaphors
occur. The individual anaphors are then re-
solved by the functional centering algorithm
described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract
anaphors are resolved with a different algo-
rithm. ES99 test the approach on selected
dialogues and obtain a precision of 63,6%
for discourse deictics and 66,2% for individ-
ual anaphors. They report that most errors
are due to the inability to distinguish be-
tween discourse deictics and pronouns which
vaguely refer to concepts in the preceding dis-
course (vague anaphors). Another cause of er-
ror is the lack of information about abstract
nominals. I believe that the strategy followed
by ES99 is a good starting point for inves-
tigating how far one can go in resolving in-
dividual and abstract anaphors in dialogues
on the basis of the local contexts in which the
anaphors occur. I have adapted the algorithm
so it accounts for Danish data and have ap-
plied it to Danish dialogues.4
In section 2 I shortly present the original
centering framework and functional centering
as described in (Strube, 1998), S98. In sec-
tion 3 Eckert and Strube&apos;s algorithm is in-
troduced and in 4 the Danish personal and
demonstrative pronouns are described with
focus on discourse deictics in dialogues. In
section 5 I present my adaptation of the ES99-
algorithm to Danish data. Section 6 con-
tains an evaluation of the results obtained by
manually testing the adapted ES99-algorithm
on randomly selected dialogues from the col-
lection &amp;quot;Samtale hos Lwgen&amp;quot; (Conversation

2 Centering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974939434782609">
In GJW95 the entities which link an utterance
Un to the others in the same discourse seg-
ment are the centers of that utterance. Each
utterance is assigned a set of forward-looking
centers, C1, and, with the exception of the
initial utterance of the segment, a backward-
looking center, Cb. The CI, of an utterance Un
connects with one of the forward-looking cen-
ters of the preceding utterance Un_1 while the
forward-looking centers only depend on the
expressions in U. The forward-looking cen-
ters are partially ordered to reflect relative
prominence. GJW95 recognize three types of
transition relation across pairs of utterances:
continue, retain and shift (see table 1).
Center movement and realization are con-
strained by two rules:
Rule 1: If any element of Cf(Un-i) is real-
ized by a pronoun in Un, then Cb(Un)
must also be realized by a pronoun
Rule 2: Center continuation is preferred to
center retaining which is preferred to cen-
ter shifting

In S98 the functions of the backward-looking
center and the transitions in the centering
theory are replaced by the order of elements
in a list of salient discourse entities, the S-
list. The ranking criteria for the elements in
the S-list are based on (Prince, 1981), where
discourse entities are classified into hearer-
old (OLD), mediated (MED) and hearer-new
(NEW). The two tuples (x, uttx, posz) and
(y, utty, posy) in the S-list indicate that the
entity x is evoked in utterance utt at posi-
tion posx and that y is evoked in utterance
utty at position posy respectively. Given that
utt and utty refer to Un or Un-1, the follow-

The 598-algorithm consists in testing a re-
ferring expression against the elements in the
S-list from left to right until the test suc-
ceeds. The S-list is then updated so that new
elements are inserted according to the S-list
ranking criteria. When the analysis of an ut-
terance is finished all the entities which were
not realized in the utterance are removed from
the S-list.

ES99 propose a new algorithm for resolving
anaphors with abstract object antecedents.
Analyzing a collection of telephone conversa-
tions they distinguish the following anaphor
types: individual anaphors, discourse deic-
tics, inferrable-evoked anaphors6 and vague
anaphors. Other types of pronoun are not
taken into consideration.
Predicates that are preferentially associ-

ES99 define the following *I predicates
(Eckert and Strube, 1999b)[p. 40]:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.947465965517241">
• Equating constructions where a pronom-
inal referent is equated with an abstract

right, x isn&apos;t right.
• Arguments of verbs describing
propositional attitude which take
S&apos;-complements, e.g., assume.
• Object of do.
• Predicate or anaphoric referent is a &amp;quot;rea-

individual referent, e.g., x is a car.
• Copula constructions with adjectives
which can only be applied to concrete en-
tities, e.g., x is expensive, x is tasty, x is

Grounded acts are used as domain for the
anaphor resolution algorithms in dialogues.

In particular two dialogue acts, Initiations
(Is) and Acknowledgments (As) are rec-
ognized. Is have semantic content, while As
are only used to ground the preceding I. Ac-
knowledgments/Initiations (A/Is) are di-
alogue acts that have both the function of
grounding the preceding I and that of estab-
lishing a new I. An I and the correspond-
ing A, together with longer Is in the same
turn-taking which do not need to be acknowl-
edged, constitute a Synchronizing Unit
(SU). Short Is which are not acknowledged
are ignored by the resolution algorithms.
ES99 follow i.a. (Webber, 1991) in assum-
ing that anaphoric discourse deictic reference
involves reference coercion and that only dis-
course sections adjacent to the anaphor or,
using Webber&apos;s terminology, sections on the
right frontier of the discourse structure tree,
are available for discourse-deictic reference.
Like (Asher, 1993) they assume that the type
of abstract object is determined by the con-
text in which the anaphor occurs. Anaphora
referring to abstract objects are resolved us-
ing a list, the A-list. The A-list is only filled
when discourse deictics occur and its elements
remain for one I. The parts of the linguistic
contexts are accessed in the following order:
1. the A-list; 2. in the same I the clause to the
left of the clause which contains the anaphor;
3. within the previous I the rightmost main
clause and subordinated clauses to its right;
4. within previous Is the rightmost complete
sentence, if previous I is an incomplete sen-
tence.
The anaphora resolution algorithm for
third person singular neuter personal pro-
nouns is the following (Eckert and Strube,
1999a):
case PRO is I-incompatible
if resolveDiscourseDeictic(PRO)
then classify as discourse deictic
else classify as vague pronoun;

then classify as individual pronoun

The same algorithm is used for demon-
stratives, with the exception that the last
two if constructions in the algorithm for pro-
nonns are reversed reflecting the preference
for demonstratives to be discourse deictics
(Webber, 1991).

In this section I shortly describe Danish third
person personal and possessive prononns and
demonstrative pronouns. The description fo-
cuses on the discourse deictic use of these pro-
nouns based on occurrences in three Danish
dialogue collections, Bysoc,7 SL and PID.
My description is also based on (Allan et al.,
1995). The third person singular personal and
possessive pronouns can be found in table 2,
while the third person plural personal and
possessive pronouns can be found in table 3.8
Den, det and de are also used as defi-
nite articles (the) and demonstrative deter-
miners (this/that and these/those). In spo-
ken language the demonstratives are always
stressed.8 Den, det, de are demonstratives
if followed by the adverbials her and der in
which case they correspond to the English
this/these and that/those respectively. Fur-
thermore, the demonstratives denne, dette
(this) and disse (these) exist.
Feminine and masculine pronouns generally
co-referl° with persons, but can also refer to
pets as in English. Common gender pronouns
refer to common gender nouns which do not
denote humans. Common gender nouns de-
noting humans are neutral as to the sex of
the person they refer to. Thus the gender of

the referring pronoun corresponds to the sex
of the person the noun refers to.
Neuter gender pronouns are used to refer
to neuter nouns. They can also refer to a
few common person nouns in neuter gender,
such as barn (child) and menneske (person)
if the sex of the person is unknown or irrel-
evant (syntactic agreement). In case the sex
is known or relevant, the appropriate femi-
nine or masculine pronouns are used (seman-
tic agreement). The two cases are illustrated
in the following examples:
barnet var pd millimeter sd stort
det skulle v&amp;re i kengden og i hov-
edstorrelsen og.
(the child was precisely as high as it
ought to be and its head was as big
as it ought to and...)
set oh... jeg kunne ga ud for jeg
havde mit barnebarn med pd ire et
halvt dr &amp;I..., kunne jeg jo bare holde
ham&amp;quot; i /minden
(so oh... I could leave because I was
together with my three and half year
old grandchild so..., I could just hold
his hand)
Both den and det can refer to collective
nouns. In this case the choice between the
singular den or det and plural de depends on
whether the speaker focuses on the collective
meaning or on the individuals. Det and in
few idiomatic expressions den are also used
as expletives.
In Danish the most frequently used dis-
course deictic is det which corresponds to it,
this or that. Other discourse deictics are det
her (this) and det der (that). These two deic-
tics can be used in most of the same contexts
as det, although there seems to be a prefer-
ence for using them to refer to several clauses.
The neuter demonstrative dette (this) has also
a discourse deictic use, but is mostly used in
written language. I did not found any occur-
rences of it in the three dialogue collections.
As discourse deictic det refers to an infini-
tive or a clause, as it is the case in the follow-
ing examples:
At ryge er farligt og det er ogsd dyrt
(Smoking is dangerous and it is also
expensive)
A: Du skal tage en blodprove
(You have to take a blood test)
B: Hvorfor det?
(Why is that?)
Det is also used as the subject complement
of mere (be) and blive (become) in answers.
A: Blev du fxrdig med opgaven?
(Were you done with the task?)
B: Ja, det blev jeg
(lit. Yes, that was I)
(Yes, I was)
Det refers to a verb phrase when it is used
as the object complement for the verb have
(have), gore (do) and modal verbs as in

<bodyText confidence="0.9640315">
Alle faldt, men det gjorde jeg ikke
(lit. All fell, but that did I not)

attitude verbs and other verbs which take
clausal complements, such as synes (think),
tro (believe) and vide (know), sige (say), habe
(hope):

In the latter three cases the pronoun det is
often topicalized, i.e. it appears before the
main verb, in the place that usually is occu-
pied by the subject&amp;quot;.
Det can also refer to more clauses, or to
something that can vaguely be inferred from
the discourse.

In the above example the deictics in the
last utterance do not refer to a single clause
or predicate, but to the whole family history
of icterus.
To conclude, Danish deictics are used in
more contexts than the English ones. Espe-
cially noticeable is the Danish use of discourse
deictics in cases where elliptical constructions
are normal in English.12

As Eckert and Strube notice for English,
also in Danish there are cases where the con-
texts of an anaphor can allow both an in-
dividual NP and an abstract object. Some
examples are copula constructions like x er
godt/ddrligt (x is good/bad), and objects of
verbs such as elske (love), hade (hate), fore-
treekke (prefer). To partially accomodate this,
I have added the following condition to the
algorithm: in the above cases the anaphor is
classified as A* incompatible unless the pre-
vious clause contains a raising adjective con-
struction in which case it is considered I* in-
compatible. Consider the following two ex-
amples:
Peter boede i et Twit hus. Det
hadede han.
(Peter lived in a red house. He
hated it.)
Det er dodsygt at sidde pd et vaskeri.
Det hader jeg.
(It is boring to be in a laundry. I
hate it)
In the first example the algorithm chooses
et rodt hus (a red house) as the antecedent
of det, while in the second example the algo-
rithm chooses at sidde pa et vaskeri (being in
a laundry) instead of et vaskeri. There are
cases, similar to the first example, where it is
impossible, without a deeper analysis of the
discourse to determine whether an anaphor
refers to an individual NP or an abstract ob-
ject.
In the test I have taken into account the
metaphorical uses of verbs encoded in a se-
mantic lexicon, the Danish SIMPLE lexicon
(Pedersen and Nimb, 2000).
From the analysis of anaphors in the con-
sidered dialogue collections I found that many
individual anaphors refer back to entities
which have not been evoked in the immedi-
ately preceding utterances (SUs) and thus
they would not be on the S-list (the enti-
ties which are not evoked in the current SU
are removed from the list). Thus I have ex-
tended the scope of resolution for all individ-
ual anaphors except the neutral singular. If
an antecedent to an individual NP cannot be
resolved by looking at the actual S-list, the
elements on the S-lists for the preceding SUs
are considered.13

<bodyText confidence="0.996688666666667">
I have applied the modified ES 99-algorithm to
three randomly selected SL dialogues (6,305
words) and to one of the dialogues between
native Danes recorded in the PID collection
(5,367 words). It must be noted that in my
test only one annotator (the author) iden-
tified dialogue acts, classified the anaphors
in the dialogues, marked NPs and anaphor
antecedents. In (Eckert and Strube, 1999a)
these tasks have been accomplished by two
annotators.
In dividing the three SL dialogues into dis-
course segments I have mainly used a parti-
tion made by two researchers at the Univer-
sity of Copenhagen in an independent project.
The discrimination criteria were topic shift
and a few linguistic clues. I have then ap-

(Walker, 1998). In the present test it was necessary to
go back maximally seven SUs to find an antecedent
to an individual pronominal anaphor.

plied the same discrimination criteria to the
dialogue from the PID collection.
I have defined dialogue units syntactically
following (Eckert and Strube, 1999a).14
Because it is not always possible to dis-
tinguish between den, det, de used as per-
sonal or demonstrative pronouns without hav-
ing access to stress information, I have classi-
fied them as personal pronouns unless they
are topicalized, or occur in syntactic con-
structions where demonstratives are normally
used. The manual classification of pronouns
and demonstratives in the four dialogues can
be found in table 4.
The results of the individual anaphora reso-
lution algorithm can be found in table 5, while
the results of the discourse deictics resolution
algorithm are given in table 6.
The results obtained are better than those
reported in (Eckert and Strube, 1999a), but I
have used more background information than
ES99 and extended the scope of resolution for
individual anaphors (without this extension
the precision of the individual resolution al-
gorithm was of 64.5). Furthermore the Dan-
ish deictic det occurs in more contexts than
the English it, this and that, thus there are
more I* predicates in the Danish version of
the algorithm than in the original one. The
fact that only one annotator divided the dia-
logues into SUs may also have influenced the
results.
The algorithm classifies anaphors and re-
solves some of them, thus there are two types
of error, classification errors and resolution er-
rors. Most of the instances of wrongly classi-
fied anaphors are due to the fact that the al-
gorithm classifies vague anaphors as discourse
deictics and then resolves the anaphor to a
preceding predicate or clause. Few errors are
due to the fact, already noticed by ES99, that
the defined I* and A* predicates do not con-
tain information about nominals referring to
abstract objects.15 These errors resulted in
most cases in resolution errors.
Some errors are due to the inability to find

an individual NP antecedent to the pronoun
det, when this refers generally to an NP of dif-
ferent gender16 and to wrongly resolved plu-
ral pronouns with complex NP antecedents or
with no antecedent. Correctly classified, but
wrongly resolved discourse deictics are, i.a.,
due to the fact that I did not mark in any
particular way parenthetical utterances. The
latter kind of errors are chaining errors. In
table 7 the occurrences of each type of error
are reported.

7 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812034482759">
The adapted ES99-algorithm has been tested
on two kinds of dialogue, that have been clas-
sified by one annotator. Although the types
of dialogue in the Danish test is quite different
from that used by ES99, the results reported
in the previous section (6) indicate that the
algorithm performs as well for Danish as for
English. Because the use of Danish pronouns,
especially those referring to abstract objects,
is different from the English one, these results
provide an interesting evaluation of the algo-
rithm.
As noticed by ES99, adding more lexical
knowledge to the algorithm could improve its
performance. I also believe that the con-
texts of abstract anaphors should be studied
in more dialogues, and that more attention
should be given to the connection between
discourse deictics and the relations that link
pieces of discourse to each other (Webber,
1991; Fraurud, 1992; Asher, 1993; Kehler,
1997).
Further work will thus consist in analyzing
the occurrences of discourse deictics in both
written texts and dialogues and paying
additional attention to the relations linking
pieces of discourse to each other (i.a. (Hobbs,
1979; Mann and Thompson, 1987; Polanyi,
1988)

Short Is which are not acknowledged are ignored by the resolution algorithms. ES99 follow i.a. (Webber, 1991) in assuming that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves reference coercion and that only discourse sections adjacent to the anaphor or, using Webber&apos;s terminology, sections on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree, are available for discourse-deictic reference. Like (Asher, 1993) they assume that the type of abstract object is determined by the context in which the anaphor occurs. Anaphora referring to abstract objects are resolved using a list, the A-list. The A-list is only filled when discourse deictics occur and its elements remain for one I. The parts of the linguistic contexts are accessed in the following order: 1. the A-list; 2. in the same I the clause to the left of the clause which contains the anaphor; 3. within the previous I the rightmost main clause and subordinated clauses to its right; 4. within previous Is the rightmost complete sentence, if previous</context>

Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), henceforth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolving anaphors referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues. The algorithm is based on rules for discriminating among the two types of anaphor based on the predicative contexts in which the anaphors occur. The individual anaphors are then resolved by the functional centering algorithm described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract anaphors are resolved with a different algorithm.

Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), henceforth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolving anaphors referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues. The algorithm is based on rules for discriminating among the two types of anaphor based on the predicative contexts in which the anaphors occur. The individual anaphors are then resolved by the functional centering algorithm described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract anaphors are resolved with a different algorithm.

It must be noted that in my test only one annotator (the author) identified dialogue acts, classified the anaphors in the dialogues, marked NPs and anaphor antecedents. In (Eckert and Strube, 1999a) these tasks have been accomplished by two annotators. In dividing the three SL dialogues into discourse segments I have mainly used a partition made by two researchers at the University of Copenhagen in an independent project. The discrimination criteria were topic shift and a few linguistic clues. I have then ap13I have followed the cache model described in (Walker, 1998).

The manual classification of pronouns and demonstratives in the four dialogues can be found in table 4. The results of the individual anaphora resolution algorithm can be found in table 5, while the results of the discourse deictics resolution algorithm are given in table 6. The results obtained are better than those reported in (Eckert and Strube, 1999a), but I have used more background information than ES99 and extended the scope of resolution for individual anaphors (without this extension the precision of the individual resolution algorithm was of 64.5). Furthermore the Danish deictic det occurs in more contexts than the English it, this and that, thus there are more I* predicates in the Danish version of the algorithm than in the original one. The fact that only one annotator divided the dialogues into SUs may also have influenced the results.

I hate it) In the first example the algorithm chooses et rodt hus (a red house) as the antecedent of det, while in the second example the algorithm chooses at sidde pa et vaskeri (being in a laundry) instead of et vaskeri. There are cases, similar to the first example, where it is impossible, without a deeper analysis of the discourse to determine whether an anaphor refers to an individual NP or an abstract object. In the test I have taken into account the metaphorical uses of verbs encoded in a semantic lexicon, the Danish SIMPLE lexicon (Pedersen and Nimb, 2000). From the analysis of anaphors in the considered dialogue collections I found that many individual anaphors refer back to entities which have not been evoked in the immediately preceding utterances (SUs) and thus they would not be on the S-list (the entities which are not evoked in the current SU are removed from the list). Thus I have extended the scope of resolution for all individual anaphors except the neutral singular. If an antecedent to an individual NP cannot be resolved by looking at the actual S-list, the elements on the S-lists for the preceding SUs are considered.13 6 Evaluation o</context>

Eckert and Strube (1999a; 1999b), henceforth ES99, describe an algorithm for resolving anaphors referring to individual NPs and abstract objects in English dialogues. The algorithm is based on rules for discriminating among the two types of anaphor based on the predicative contexts in which the anaphors occur. The individual anaphors are then resolved by the functional centering algorithm described in (Strube, 1998), while abstract anaphors are resolved with a different algorithm. ES99 test the approach on selected dialogues and obtain a precision of 63,6% for discourse deictics and 66,2% for individual anaphors. They report that most errors are due to the inability to distinguish between discourse deictics and pronouns which vaguely refer to concepts in the preceding discourse (vague anaphors). Another cause of error is the lack of information about abstract nominals. I believe that the strategy followed by ES99 is a good starting point for investigating how far one can go in resolving individual and ab</context>

It must be noted that in my test only one annotator (the author) identified dialogue acts, classified the anaphors in the dialogues, marked NPs and anaphor antecedents. In (Eckert and Strube, 1999a) these tasks have been accomplished by two annotators. In dividing the three SL dialogues into discourse segments I have mainly used a partition made by two researchers at the University of Copenhagen in an independent project. The discrimination criteria were topic shift and a few linguistic clues. I have then ap13I have followed the cache model described in (Walker, 1998).

Is have semantic content, while As are only used to ground the preceding I. Acknowledgments/Initiations (A/Is) are dialogue acts that have both the function of grounding the preceding I and that of establishing a new I. An I and the corresponding A, together with longer Is in the same turn-taking which do not need to be acknowledged, constitute a Synchronizing Unit (SU). Short Is which are not acknowledged are ignored by the resolution algorithms. ES99 follow i.a. (Webber, 1991) in assuming that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves reference coercion and that only discourse sections adjacent to the anaphor or, using Webber&apos;s terminology, sections on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree, are available for discourse-deictic reference. Like (Asher, 1993) they assume that the type of abstract object is determined by the context in which the anaphor occurs. Anaphora referring to abstract objects are resolved using a list, the A-list. The A-list is only filled when discourse deictics occur and its elements remain for one I. The parts of the linguist</context>

The description focuses on the discourse deictic use of these pronouns based on occurrences in three Danish dialogue collections, Bysoc,7 SL and PID. My description is also based on (Allan et al., 1995). The third person singular personal and possessive pronouns can be found in table 2, while the third person plural personal and possessive pronouns can be found in table 3.8 Den, det and de are also used as definite articles (the) and demonstrative determiners (thi</context>

Because the use of Danish pronouns, especially those referring to abstract objects, is different from the English one, these results provide an interesting evaluation of the algorithm. As noticed by ES99, adding more lexical knowledge to the algorithm could improve its performance. I also believe that the contexts of abstract anaphors should be studied in more dialogues, and that more attention should be given to the connection between discourse deictics and the relations that link pieces of discourse to each other (Webber, 1991; Fraurud, 1992; Asher, 1993; Kehler, 1997). Further work will thus consist in analyzing the occurrences of discourse deictics in both written texts and dialogues and paying additional attention to the relations linking pieces of discourse to each other (i.a. (Hobbs, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1987; Polanyi, 1988) 16The use of especially generic plural pronouns in Swedish is discussed in (Fraurud, 1992). 63 Table 4: Classification of Pronouns and Demonstratives A5 AA10 AAll TR3 E Individual Pro 39 43 34 51 167 Discourse Deictics Pro 25 16 17 34 92 Vague Pro 4 6 0 2 12 Inferrable Evoked 1 0 0 2 3</context>
