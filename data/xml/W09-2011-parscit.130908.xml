Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999558866666666">
This paper investigates a little-studied class of
adjectives that we refer to as ‘complex adjec-
tives’, i.e., operationally, adjectives consti-
tuted of at least two word tokens separated by
a hyphen. We study the properties of these ad-
jectives using two very large text collections:
a portion of Wikipedia and a Web corpus. We
consider three corpus-based measures of mor-
phological productivity, and we investigate
how productivity rankings based on them cor-
relate with each other under different condi-
tions, thus providing different angles both on
the morphological productivity of complex
adjectives, and on the productivity measures
themselves.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867052631579">
Adjectives as a syntactic category have received
relatively scarce attention in theoretical and com-
putational linguistics, at least when compared to
noun and verbs. Within the class of adjectives
there is a particular group that has not received
much specific attention. These are the adjectives
that can be operationally defined by the fact that in
the orthography they are constituted by at least two
tokens separated by a hyphen. Examples include:
left-wing politician, best-selling book, part-time
job, large-scale experiment. In this paper we will
focus the analysis on 2-item adjectives; however
the class includes several examples with more than
two items: day-to-day, tongue-in-cheek, up-and-
coming, state-of-the-art, pay-as-you-go, all-you-
can-eat, etc.
We refer to these adjectives as ‘complex adjec-
tives’. They allow several mechanisms for the
generation of new linguistic expressions which are

spread along a continuum that goes from full
productivity to lexicalized forms. Treating
complex adjective formation as a morphological
process allows us to characterize them in the light
of the notion of morphological productivity.
Morphological productivity falls within the
domain of how the broad notion of creativity is
realized in language, by providing mechanisms for
generating new words that are unintentional,
unlimited and regular (Evert and Lüdeling 2001).
Previous work has typically considered complex
adjectives only in the context of tokenization and
generally low-level text processing, without
specific focus on the class per se. Moilanen and
Pulman (2008) identify polarity markers in certain
complex adjectives for the purpose for assigning
sentiment polarities to unknown words (well-built
is positive, rat-infested is negative).
Highly productive classes like complex
adjectives are problematic for computational
lexicons in that they bring about a large number of
unknown words. A typology of complex adjectives
is important to support computational lexicons and
the NLP applications based on them, for example
by listing out the patterns (as defined in section 3)
that complex adjectives are based on.

The analysis presented here is based on two large
text collections. The first is a portion of Wikipedia,
consisting of about 250 million tokens. The second
collection is a Web corpus specifically built for
NLP applications targeted at adjectives, consisting
of about 290 million tokens (after some reasonable
clean-up process). The list of all adjectives in
WordNet1 was used as a seed list. Each seed adjec-
tive was sent as a query to the Yahoo search engine

BOSS API2. For all the 1000 (the maximum al-
lowed by the API) returned web results, each URL
was used to fetch the corresponding web page, and
the full text of the web page was processed for ad-
dition to the corpus. Both corpora were POS-
tagged using the Stanford POS tagger3 (reported
accuracy is about 97%). Using such tagger that
was trained on the Penn Treebank makes it easy to
identify complex adjectives, since the Penn Tree-
bank tagging guidelines explicitly prescribe that
hyphenated compounds used as modifiers should
be tagged as adjectives (JJ).
The two corpora give a slightly different view
on the linguistic behavior of adjectives. The
Wikipedia corpus is intended to provide a picture
of adjective distribution in a large and relatively
homogenous collection of current English text. The
Web corpus is intended to bias the collection in the
direction of making sure that at least for the
WordNet seed adjectives a large number of in-
stances are present even for adjectives that would
have otherwise a very low frequency in a properly
balanced corpus.
Throughout the paper we will use the Wikipedia
corpus as the main data collection for the
presentation of the analysis, and we will use the
Web corpus as a validation set, to assess the
stability and reliability of the results obtained on
the Wikipedia corpus.

We partition the orthographically defined class of
complex adjectives in morphological categories
defined by a variable part and a base generator. For
example ‘X-free’ is a morphological category that
specifies that the base generator -free can be com-
bined with other words to form complex adjectives
such as risk-free, toll-free, gluten-free, etc. The
two corpora are used to analyze and quantify how
different degrees of linguistic creativity are exhib-
ited by different classes of complex adjectives. We
will show that this yields a ranking of complex
adjective types along a continuum going from high
productivity to lexicalized forms. Specifically, we
characterize the linguistic creativity of complex
adjectives through three distinct and complemen-
tary measures of morphological productivity, fol-
lowing Baayen (1993, 2006) and his notation:

realized productivity, expanding productivity, and
potential productivity. Now, Evert and Lüdeling
(2001) show that, in the general case, automatic
pre-processing of text corpora with current mor-
phological analyzers yields results that are too
noisy for Baayen’s measure of productivity to be
reliable. The fact that complex adjectives are
orthographically defined by the presence of the
hyphen and the components are easy to separate
eliminates some of those text-processing problems.
By choice, we take at face value the morphological
parse provided by the hyphen, and therefore we do
not run into situations where the phonotactics ob-
scures the morphological analysis (e.g., lady vs.
ladies), affix ordering (undoable), accidental string
identity (restaurant does not instantiate the prefix
re-), and words generated by creative rather then
morphological productive processes (youtube).
Relying on the orthographical hyphen eases the
problems of automatic morphological pre-
processing and makes this a particularly good do-
main for using Baayen’s measures.
Realized productivity is defined as V=V(C,N),
the number of word types (as opposed to word to-
kens) of morphological category C in a corpus of
N tokens. The intuition behind this measure is that
it expresses the sheer size of a morphological cate-
gory within a particular corpus.
Expanding productivity is defined as P* =
V(1,C,N)/V(1,N), where V(1,C,N) is the number
of words of category C that occur only once in a
corpus of N tokens, and V(1,N) is the number of
words of any category that occur only once in a
corpus of N tokens. This measure expresses the
contribution of the morphological category C to
the growth rate of the total vocabulary. The under-
lying intuition is that a morphologically productive
category contributes to the growth rate of the vo-
cabulary of a language, and vocabulary growth rate
can be estimated by the number of hapax legomena
(words with frequency 1) in a sufficiently large
corpus. Hapax legomena in turn are taken to be
good estimators of novel linguistic forms.
Potential productivity is defined as P =
V(1,C,N)/N(C), where N(C) is the total number of
tokens in the corpus for a given category C. This
measure expresses the growth rate of the vocabu-
lary of the category C itself. In other words, it ex-
presses the ease with which a category can be
applied to new words.

These three measures are complementary, in that
they capture different aspects of morphological
productivity that can possibly be at odds with each
other (Baayen 2006).

4 Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892846153846">
At the highest level the two POS-tagged corpora
allow us to compare the distribution of complex
adjectives with respect to other major syntactic
categories. In the context of morphological produc-
tivity, the vocabulary of a morphological process is
the number of types that the process can potentially
generate. If we understand complex adjective for-
mation as a morphological process, we can obtain
their general vocabulary growth curve by plotting
the number of types against the number of tokens
in a corpus. Figure 1 shows vocabulary growth
curves for nouns, verbs, adjectives and their hy-
phenated counterparts for the Wikipedia corpus.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998229">

<bodyText confidence="0.999987014925373">
Complex adjectives exhibit a surprisingly high
growth rate, which at 250M tokens still doesn’t
tend to converge. The number of types correspond-
ing to the final corpus size can be interpreted as an
estimate of the realized productivity of complex
adjectives as a whole class.
We focus the analysis on two-item adjectives,
i.e., those of the form ‘A-B’ such as cat-like.
We describe first the data collection process. We
process each POS-tagged corpus from beginning to
end, and for each complex adjective (defined by
the tag JJ and the presence of a hyphen), we gener-
ate all the possible categories by replacing in turn
each item with a variable. So cat-like yields the
two possible categories ‘cat-X’ and ‘X-like’; day-
to-day yields ‘X-to-day’, ‘day-X-day’, ‘day-to-X’
and the special case ‘X-to-X’, where the two side
items are identical. Then for each category we
count the number of types in that category and the
number of tokens for each type, including hapax
legomena. So the category ‘X-like’ includes the
types dog-like, cat-like, mouse-like, etc., and each
type is instantiated by a certain number of tokens
(including types instantiated by exactly 1 token). In
this way we obtain the basic counts that are needed
to compute the three measures of productivity in-
troduced above. Once these measures are obtained,
all morphological categories (such as ‘X-like’) can
be sorted into three productivity rankings corre-
sponding to the three measures.
Of the three measures, realized and expanding
productivity are by design directly dependent on
corpus size, whereas potential productivity is de-
pendent on the relative ratio of morphological
categories but not directly on corpus size. This en-
tails that, especially for the first two measures,
productivity rankings obtained on a corpus of a
particular size are not necessarily significant, in
that productivity rankings obtained on corpora of
different sizes could be different.
Realized and expanding productivity are af-
fected in different ways by corpus size. Everything
else being equal, realized productivity estimates
will be more reliable with larger corpora. Expand-
ing productivity is based on the assumption that
hapax legomena (i.e., rare words with the lowest
frequency in a corpus) are good estimators of mor-
phological productivity. Rare words include vari-
ous subtypes: misspellings, proper names, foreign
words, words from different registers or genres
than those represented in the corpus, new words
generated by non-regular creative processes, and
new words generated by morphologically produc-
tive processes. In a ‘small’ corpus, hapax le-
gomena will include many words that do not fall in
any of categories above, but just happen to be rela-
tively uncommon words. As corpus size increases,
uncommon words have a chance to occur more
often, and the proportion of true morphological
neologisms among hapaxes increases.
Given the dependency on corpus size, the ques-
tion arises of how reliable productivity rankings
are that haven been obtained for a specific corpus.
In order to assess rankings reliability, we divided
both the Wikipedia and Web corpus into 20 chunks
of the same size, and then we added them up one
after the other, essentially obtaining 20 corpora of

increasing size for each of the two original text
collections. Finally for each intermediate corpus
we recomputed the productivity measures and
rankings based on them. At this point we can
measure the stability of the final productivity rank-
ing for a given corpus by comparing it with each of
the intermediate rankings using Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient.

Plotting corpus size against Spearman’s ρ coef-
ficient reveals that rankings for realized and ex-
panding productivity in both the Wikipedia corpus
and the Web corpus are very stable. For example,
for expanding productivity in the Wikipedia corpus
the ranking of the top 20 complex adjectives does
not change any more after the first 5M corpus
chunk. Figures 2 and 3 show how Spearman’s co-
efficient between the full Wikipedia corpus and
each of the 19 sub-corpora varies as a function of
corpus size for the top 25, 50 and 100 adjectives.
Curves for the Web corpus are similar.
As corpus size continues to increase, a larger
and larger portion of the rankings stabilizes, sug-
gesting that realized and expanding productivity
capture substantial properties of the language of
which the Wikipedia corpus and the Web corpus
are respectively representative.
The dependency of productivity rankings on a
specific corpus is a reminder that another impor-
tant factor that has been observed to affect linguis-
tic creativity as expressed by morphological
productivity is register and genre variation. In this
context we are using two corpora that are represen-
tative of different types of language, and could
therefore have substantially different rankings.
However, it turns out that Spearman’s rank correla-
tion between the full size of the Wikipedia and
Web corpus for both realized and expanding pro-
ductivity rankings is quite strong (see Table 1).

The high Spearman’s correlation values confirm
the stability of reliability of realized and expanding
productivity rankings across different corpora.
The next question is to what extent productivity
rankings based on different measures correlate
with each other. We consider first the relationship
between realized and expanding productivity. The
two notions focus by design on different aspects of
morphological productivity: realized productivity
is oriented towards the ‘present’: a morphological
process may be common to many existing word
types, but might have no ability to be applied to
generate new words. Baayen (1993) also refers to
it as ‘extent of use’. Expanding productivity is in-
tended to assess the rate at which a morphological
process is expanding in the language. A morpho-
logical process may be able to spread quickly in
terms of its ability to generate new words, and yet
not be very common in the general language.
In order to quantify the degree of agreement be-
tween realized and expanding productivity for
complex adjectives we computed Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient between pairs of productiv-
ity rankings (for the top 100 adjectives) at each of
the intermediate corpus sizes described above, for
both the Wikipedia and Web corpus.

the Wikipedia corpus (the graph is similar for the

Web corpus) the correlation between realized and
expanding productivity is very strong, the value of
ρ being constantly around 0.9 from the very begin-
ning, therefore independently of corpus size. We
can interpret this fact as suggesting that the class of
complex adjectives is overall a dynamic class, in
the sense that its members, even the most estab-
lished (i.e., those with high realized productivity),
continue to expand in the language and to allow
speakers to easily create new words. Table 2 shows
the top 20 complex adjectives for both realized and
expanding productivity.

<figureCaption confidence="0.781944833333333">
Figure 4: Productivity Rankings Correlation for the

Figure 4 also shows that Spearman’s correlation
of both realized and expanding productivity with
respect to potential productivity is significantly
weaker. It is important to note that in the case of
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.997513586206896">
potential productivity we arbitrarily chose to re-
quire that the total number of tokens in the corpus
for a given morphological category (the denomina-
tor of the potential productivity formula) be at least
100. We will show later that choosing a high value,
(such as 100) for this factor indeed increases the
strength of the correlation between potential pro-
ductivity and the other two types. With low values
the correlation coefficient is closer or equal to –1.
We are now going to discuss how rankings for
potential productivity (and, consequently, their
degree of correlation with realized and expanding
productivity) vary with the choice of the minimum
threshold for the denominator value of the formula
P = V(1,C,N)/N(C).
In general the situation for potential productivity
is quite a different. On one hand it doesn’t depend
directly on corpus size like the other two measures.
On the other hand, its definition as the ratio of ha-
pax legomena of a morphological category with
respect to all tokens of that category makes it sus-
ceptible to frequency effects. If a corpus is too
small or a morphological category is fairly rare this
measure will overestimate the productivity of low
frequency items. In the extreme case, a morpho-
logical category instantiated by exactly one type
that occurs exactly once in the corpus will get a
potential productivity value of 1, the highest possi-
ble.

The notion of potential productivity is often
used, especially in Baayen’s work, in a deductive
setting: typically a relatively small number of deri-
vational morphemes is selected, and an in-depth
analysis is carried out, for example assessing intui-
tive productivity rankings against those obtained
from corpus statistics. The goal is often to achieve
high explanatory depth, integrating for example
mental processing and socio-linguistic factors. In
this context the target morphemes are typically
fairly common in the language, and a sufficiently
large corpus will provide a sufficiently large sam-
ple of each morphological category so that the fre-
quency effects mentioned above are negligible.
On the other hand, the setting of the work pre-
sented in this paper is inductive in nature, in that,
by capitalizing on the easy identification of com-
plex adjectives thanks to the orthography, we aim
at an exploratory characterization of a large class
of morphological categories.

In practice, in the large-scale scale setting of the
present work, frequency effects have a significant
consequence on how potential productivity values
are computed, and on the rankings that derive from
them. For the Wikipedia corpus 49.36% (40223
out of 81481) of the complex adjective morpho-
logical categories have only 1 type with 1 token.
For example the category ‘X-distracted’ (based on
a past participle like the much more common cate-
gory ‘X-controlled’, which has types such as com-
puter-controlled, electronically-controlled, etc.)
has only the type easily-distracted, which occurs
only once in the corpus. By blindly applying the
formula V(1,C,N)/N(C), we would conclude that
complex adjectives that occur only once have the
highest potential productivity (1/1=1), which runs
counter to intuition.
One option here would be to try to extrapolate
the value of the potential productivity measure
with respect to larger corpus sizes, using statistical
models (LNRE models, for ‘Large Number of Rare
Events’ models) that are appropriate for the Zip-
fian properties of word frequency distributions, as
done in Baayen (2001). However, Evert and
Lüdeling (2001) provide a detailed analysis of the
specific problems encountered in automatic pre-
processing of large amounts of textual data, and
conclude that in the general case automatic tools
deliver results that are too noisy to yield reliable
extrapolations of potential productivity measures.
For this reason we choose instead to focus on
the two existing corpora and explore how potential
productivity measures vary when constraints are
imposed on the minimum number of tokens that
instantiate the morphological category whose po-
tential productivity we want to measure.
We compute potential productivity measures for
the full Wikipedia corpus by setting a minimum
threshold for the number of tokens that instantiate
morphological categories, starting from 0 (no con-
straint) and proceeding in increments of 5 up to
100. For each threshold level we derive productiv-
ity rankings.
We consider first a variant on the notion of sta-
bility of the productivity ranking by computing
Spearman’s rank correlation between the ranking
obtained when setting the minimum threshold
value to 100 and each of the rankings obtained at
the 5-increment interval, shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5 visualizes how frequency effects im-
pact the stability of potential productivity rankings.
When the minimum threshold is very low (0 or the
first few increments above 0), productivity rank-
ings are extremely unstable, to the point that the
correlation is negative with respect to the final
ranking based on the highest threshold value (100).
This is due to the fact that at low thresholds many
categories have productivity 1, since all the types
for those categories are instantiated by exactly 1
token. Because no attempt is made to add a second
sort order (which could be for example the number
of types) to the productivity value, the top portion
of the ranking is basically random, since there can
be hundreds of categories with productivity 1.
However, as the constraint on the minimum
threshold becomes increasingly stronger, rankings
tend to stabilize. For the last few thresholds values
the rankings at the highest positions are very simi-
lar. For the threshold value 100 the ranking is
shown in Table 3.

A simple visual comparison between Table 3
and Table 2 shows that complex adjectives with
the highest potential productivity are very different
from those with the highest realized and expanding
productivity.
The main qualitative impression is that adjec-
tives with high potential productivity seem to ex-
emplify patterns that are grammatically and
compositionally very transparent. There are many
categories based on adverbs (‘partially-X’) and

could indeed be written out as two separate words
(with a space instead of the hyphen) forming a syn-
tactic adjective phrase. On the other hand, adjec-
tives with high realized and expanding productivity
seem to exemplify patterns that tend towards lexi-
calization. Patterns like ‘anti-X’, ‘pre-X’, ‘post-X’,
‘re-X’, ‘semi-X’, ‘multi-X’ could be indeed written

We consider now another angle of the relation-
ship between potential productivity on one hand
and realized and expanding productivity on the
other. Using the same rankings obtained by vary-
ing minimum threshold for the number of tokens
that instantiate morphological categories, we calcu-
late the Spearman’s rank correlation of each poten-
tial productivity ranking at every increment
interval with respect to correspondent rankings for
realized and expanding productivity on the full
Wikipedia corpus.
Figure 6 shows that no matter how we set the
minimum threshold level, rankings for potential
productivity appear to be significantly different
with respect to the rankings for realized and ex-
panding productivity, and at least for the size of the
Wikipedia corpus the correlation remains strongly
negative.
A slight upward trend is detectable though, and
this corresponds to the fact that setting the mini-
mum threshold value to 100 increases somewhat
the strength of the correlation between potential
productivity and the other two types as corpus size
increases (as we discussed in regard to Figure 4).

sequence of the mitigation of frequency effects
(which typically affect potential productivity rank-
ings, as discussed above) brought about by the
raising of the minimum threshold level.

This behavior highlights the fact that, compared
to the other two measures, potential productivity
focuses by design on a significantly different facet
of the notion of morphological productivity. Poten-
tial productivity attempts to capture in a simple
formula the ability of a morphological category to
continue to enable speakers to generate new words.
It is intended to characterize a morphological cate-
gory in terms of the number of potential words that
can still be created in that category. Thus it could
be the case that a morphological category is well
established in the language (realized productivity)
and is expanding (expanding productivity), but
does not have much potential for further expansion
(potential productivity).
In order to explore these scenarios, we compare
the three measures for the specific morphological
pattern ‘non-X’, which has both the highest real-
ized and expanding productivity for all the 19 in-
termediate corpus slices, and for the full corpus
size (both for the Wikipedia corpus and for the
Web corpus). On the Wikipedia full corpus this
category yields 6444 distinct types for a total of
47489 tokens (including 4496 hapax legomena),
ranging from very frequent types such as non-
profit (2268 tokens), non-existent (619 tokens),

non-standard (501 tokens) to hapax legomena such
as non-ratified (1 token), non-amphibious (1 to-
ken), etc. Specifically, the fact that ‘non-X’ has the
highest expanding productivity means that it has
more hapax legomena than any other morphologi-
cal pattern. This notwithstanding, the fact that its
different types yield a very large number of tokens
results in a very low potential productivity value of
‘non-X’ (on the full corpus). Setting the minimum
threshold value at 50, the average potential produc-
tivity rank for ‘non-X’ steadily gets worse as cor-
pus size increases from rank 24 for the first
intermediate corpus to rank 2404 for the full size
corpus, in stark contrast to the rank position 1 it
has for realized and expanding productivity (we
use ranks since absolute productivity values for
different measures cannot be compared to each
other).
On the other hand, the pattern ‘X-ish’ which has
the highest potential productivity when the mini-
mum threshold is set to 100 exhibits radically dif-
ferent behavior. On the Wikipedia corpus this
category yields 99 distinct types for a total of only
112 tokens, but including 87 hapax legomena. The
most productive types are cartoon-ish and blue-ish
(with 3 tokens each) and 40-ish, blues-ish, vanity-
ish, place-ish, bully-ish, punk-ish, tree-ish, white-
ish, noir-ish (with 2 tokens each). All other types
have 1 token each. The high proportion of hapax
legomena pushes ‘X-ish’ at the very top of the po-
tential productivity ranking. As is expected, the
realized and expanding productivity ranks are
much lower. However, they do increase steadily
from rank 5204 and 3990 respectively for the first
intermediate corpus to rank 403 and 242 for the
full size corpus. We can interpret this trend as a
consequence of the fact that for the category ‘X-
ish’ almost every new token is also both a new
type and a new hapax legomena. The effect of this
is that it slows down the rate of decrease of the
realized and expanding productivity measures
(which always decrease inversely to corpus size),
thus lifting the rank of ‘X-ish’ above that of com-
petitors as corpus size increases.
Note that from a linguistic point of view, the
hyphen in potential productivity patterns seems to
signal the awareness of the writer/speaker regard-
ing the ‘novelty’ of the complex adjective, along a
continuum from compounding (‘almost-X’, ‘X-
capable’) to more established derivational mor-
phemes (‘X-ish’, ‘un-X’).

5 Conclusions and future work.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976214285714">
A general trend has consistently emerged
throughout the analysis, as illustrated by the oppo-
site properties of the categories ‘non-X’ and ‘X-
ish’. We have shown from a variety of angles how
realized and expanding productivity measures tend
to capture closely related aspects of morphological
productivity, both in terms of the specific words
and global correlation between productivity rank-
ings. On the other hand, potential productivity con-
sistently exhibits clearly different and indeed
opposite properties compared to the other two,
again both in terms of the specific words that score
the highest values and in terms of productivity
ranking correlation patterns.
The most significant question to be addressed
next is the extent to which the above-mentioned
conclusions about the relationships among differ-
ent types of morphological productivity carry over
to other segments of language.
Regarding complex adjectives, future work will
focus in more detail on their internal typology,
specifically considering the extent to which they
impose selectional restrictions (whether morpho-
syntactic or semantic in nature) on the component
associated with the base generator of a category,
and the correlation patterns between such con-
straints and the three types of morphological pro-
ductivity.

We study the properties of these adjectives using two very large text collections: a portion of Wikipedia and a Web corpus. We consider three corpus-based measures of morphological productivity, and we investigate how productivity rankings based on them correlate with each other under different conditions, thus providing different angles both on the morphological productivity of complex adjectives, and on the productivity measures themselves.</abstract>

The two notions focus by design on different aspects of morphological productivity: realized productivity is oriented towards the ‘present’: a morphological process may be common to many existing word types, but might have no ability to be applied to generate new words. Baayen (1993) also refers to it as ‘extent of use’. Expanding productivity is intended to assess the rate at which a morphological process is expanding in the language. A morphological process may be able to spread quickly in terms of its ability to generate new words, and yet not be very common in the general language.

Hapax legomena in turn are taken to be good estimators of novel linguistic forms. Potential productivity is defined as P = V(1,C,N)/N(C), where N(C) is the total number of tokens in the corpus for a given category C. This measure expresses the growth rate of the vocabulary of the category C itself. In other words, it expresses the ease with which a category can be applied to new words. 80 These three measures are complementary, in that they capture different aspects of morphological productivity that can possibly be at odds with each other (Baayen 2006). 4 Analysis At the highest level the two POS-tagged corpora allow us to compare the distribution of complex adjectives with respect to other major syntactic categories. In the context of morphological productivity, the vocabulary of a morphological process is the number of types that the process can potentially generate. If we understand complex adjective formation as a morphological process, we can obtain their general vocabulary growth curve by plotting the number of types against the number of tokens in a corpus.
