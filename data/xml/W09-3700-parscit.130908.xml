Preface: 15 years of IWCS
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9878339">
Fifteen years ago the idea of IWCS was born. We noted that, while there was a
highly successful biennial workshop in the Netherlands on formal semantics, the
Amsterdam Colloquium, that there was nothing comparable in the area of com-
putational semantics, although that area seemed to be becoming at least as inter-
esting and significant as formal semantics. As the Amsterdam Colloquium was
always held in December in uneven years, we wanted to explore the possibility of
a biennial workshop in the ‘empty’ December months of even years. And so the
“International Workshop on Computational Semantics IWCS” (without a “1”) was
organised in December 1994. The Call for Papers featured the following list of
topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999651285714286">
• ambiguous (or ‘underspecified’) semantic representations
• the use of context in interpretation
• dynamic logic and natural language
• the semantics-pragmatics interface
• incremental interpretation
• alogrithmic aspects of interpretation
• type theory and natural language interpretation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994069487179487">
Note the ‘underspecified’ semantic representations at the head of list – in quotes
since the term was not yet widely used. About half of these topics are still topics
of today’s IWCS, but the current list is much larger, reflecting the breadth that
IWCS has these days, and includes items such as semantic annotation and machine
learning of semantic structures, topics that were not even dreamt of in 1994.
Among the speakers at the first IWCS were Johan Bos, Nick Asher, Tim Fer-
nando, Claire Gardent, Jonathan Ginzburg, Graeme Hirst, Rodger Kibble, Daniel
Marcu, Massimo Poesio, Stephen Pulman, Allan Ramsay, and Matthew Stone.
There were some 35 participants, it was all quite small-scale and informal, and
we all enjoyed it. So we decided to try again two years later, but since December
appeared to be a stressful period for many people, we moved to January in 1997.
And we stayed in January of uneven years ever since.
At IWCS-2 there were some 50 participants, and things began to look seriously.
We went from two to two and a half days, included an excursion and a conference
i
dinner, and had invited speakers: Jerry Hobbs, Manfred Pinkal, and Lenhart Schu-
bert. IWCS seemed to be a viable formula. And so we decided to go for a regular
biennial series, which since then has been continuing successfully until now; a time
span of 15 years since the start in 1994.
The many high-quality contributions to IWCS-2 inspired us to contact Kluwer
Academic Publishers - would they be interested in publishing a book with edited
selected papers from the workshop? Yes they were, and they even suggested the
possibility of starting up a book series on computational semantics. After discus-
sion with the editors of the Studies in Linguistics and Philosophy series, we de-
cided to go for a subseries within the prestigious SLAP series. So far, Computing
Meaning, volumes 1, 2, and 3 have been published, based on IWCS contributions.
IWCS-3, in 1999, included a meeting organized by Patrick Blackburn and
Claire Gardent to discuss the idea of setting up a special interest group on com-
putational semantics within ACL. This was an excellent idea, and meant the start
of SIGSEM. Kees van Deemter, Patrick Blackburn, and James Pustejovsky were
invited speakers at this workshop. Over the years, the invited speakers have in-
variably formed highlights at IWCS. In the period 2001-2007 invited speakers
were James Allen, Alex Lascarides, Jan van Eijck, Patrick Hayes, Adam Kilgar-
iff, Michiel van Lambalgen, Matthew Stone, Dafydd Gibbon, Alexander Koller,
Daniel Marcu, Maarten de Rijke; Johan Bos, Makoto Kanazawa, and Paul Buite-
laar, an impressive and varied list of prominent researchers, completed at IWCS-8
by Martha Palmer, Ido Dagan, and Massimo Poesio.
At IWCS-5, in 2003, an important new element was the organization, right
before IWCS, of a joint workshop of the SIGSEM Working Group on the Rep-
resentation of Multimodal Semantic Information which had been established in
2002, and an expert group of the International Organisation for Standardisation ISO
concerned with interoperability in language resources. This associated workshop,
with a focus on semantic annotation, has been continued in 2005 and 2007 and
also continues this year, at the workshop called ISA-4: Fourth Joint ISO-SIGSEM
Workshop on Interoperable Semantic Annotation.
At IWCS-7, in 2007, it was decided to change the name of IWCS from ‘work-
shop’ to ‘conference’, while keeping the abbreviation ‘IWCS’, in order to better do
justice to the character and status that IWCS now has.
In 2009 I am going to resign from my full-time post at Tilburg University, and
this seems a good moment for me to stop organizing IWCS. I am very pleased that
Johan Bos and Stephen Pulman have offered to take over the organization. This
will also mean that IWCS is going to move around, rather than stay in Tilburg
forever. I would like to use this occasion to thank a number of people who have
been especially important for the organization of IWCS over the years.
ii
The organization committee has always included Reinhard Muskens and nearly
always Elias Thijsse, who have both given invaluable support. Ielka van der Sluis
has played a pivotal role in the organization of IWCS-4, -5, and -6. She designed
the beautiful IWCS logo, based on the ground plan of the Warande forest next
to Tilburg University. Several PhD students have over the years contributed to
the organization, including Gerrit Rentier, Leen Kievit, Margriet Verlinden, Yann
Girard, Jeroen Geertzen, Roser Morante, Marieke van Erp, Olga Petukhova, and
Sander Wubben. I am grateful to them all. Equally important has been the sup-
port of administrative staff. For many years, my then seceretary Anne Adriaensen
has been essential for a smooth organization; in recent years, Femke Wieme and
especially Lauraine Sinay have provided wonderful administrative assistance. The
support of Leen Jacobs as financial manager of the Faculty of Humanities has also
been indispensable. Special thanks go to Kiyong Lee and Laurent Romary for their
role in organizing the ISO-SIGSEM workshops associated with IWCS since 2003.
The preface to a volume of IWCS proceedings is usually just one page. But
at this turning point I thought it might be appropriate to look back a little, and to
thank a number of people who have made IWCS into the well-established con-
ference series that it has become. And looking forward, while they say that past
performance is no guarantee for the future, with a new team of organizers and the
prospect of having IWCS conferences in other locations, perhaps even more excit-
ing than Tilburg, there are good reasons to believe that IWCS will continue to be a
pleasant, fruitful, and inspiring opportunity to meet everyone who likes computa-
tional semantics.
