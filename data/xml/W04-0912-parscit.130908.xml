Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999858038461539">
One main problem for NLP applications
is that natural language expressions are
underspecified and require enrichments
of different sorts to get a truth-
conditional interpretaton in context. Un-
derspecification applies on two levels:
what is said underdetermines what is
meant, and linguistic meaning under-
specifies what is said. One instance of
this phenomenon is aspect in Russian,
especially the imperfective one. It gives
rise to a variety of readings, which are
difficult to capture by one invariant
meaning. Instead, the imperfective aspect
is sense-general; its meaning has to be
specified in the course of interpretation
by contextual cues and pragmatic infer-
ences. This paper advocates an account
of the different imperfective readings in
terms of pragmatic principles and infer-
ential heuristics based on, and supplied
by, a semantic skeleton consisting of a
‘selectional theory’ of aspect. This
framework might serve as basis for a
rule-guided derivation of aspectual read-
ings in Russian.

1 Linguistic underspecification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999403">
Natural language expressions deliver merely
templates for the construction of a contextually
relevant interpretation, namely the propositional
meaning the hearer ascribes to the respective
perceived utterance. What is linguistically given
delivers only part of the input necessary for in-
terpretation and has to be enriched and specified
by recourse to sentence-level and discourse-level
context, as well as to world-knowledge. Proposi-
tions, i.e. truth-conditional content, arise only
after that enrichment process has taken place.
NLP applications need to capture the meaning
of a linguistic input to adequately work with it in
the respective applications. But the ‘meaning’
relevant in this case, viz. the intended interpreta-
tion of an utterance, is underspecified by the
lexically given input in at least two ways. Lin-
guistic meaning underspecifies propositions, i.e.
‘what is said’ (Carston, 2002), and ‘what is said’
in turn underspecifies ‘what is meant’ (Grice,
1989). Both kinds of underspecification have to
be solved by the hearer in natural discourse set-
tings, and by the corresonding algorithms in
NLP-applications. As such applications necessar-
ily rely on linguistically given input, they have to
be supplemented by a systematic account of the
inferential mechanisms needed to enrich and
specify the lexical schemes. A further difficulty
for NLP applications is that, presuming some
form of cooperativity, any utterance can be inter-
preted by appropriately accommodating the con-
text.
Apparently, computing the contextually rele-
vant interpretation of an utterance requires more
than capturing and computing lexical input. It
relies crucially on further information and prin-
ciples of how to derive that information and
combine it with what is lexically given. Informa-
tion – contextual or conceptual – that is not con-
tained in the natural language string currently
being processed is subject to pragmatic actions
(Perrett, 2000: 102).
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2
illustrates the assumptions on pragmatic reason-
ing relevant here. Section 3 deals with Russian
ipf aspect as one example of linguistic under-
specification and sketches the semantics and
pragmatics involved in the derivation of its read-
ings. Implications for NLP will be given in sec-
tion 4, and section 5 offers a short conclusion.

2 Pragmatic Reasoning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998488846153846">
The twofold underspecification of natural lan-
guage expressions is resolved by pragmatic rea-
soning: ‘implicatures’, derived by inference
alone, enrich what is said to what is meant and
‘explicatures’, derived by decoding plus infer-
ence, enrich the lexical input to what is said.
Both interact in mutual parallel adjustment, in
that the expectation of certain implicatures con-
strains the possible range of explicatures. Thus,
we are dealing with two kinds of semantics –
lexical and propositonal – and with two kinds of
pragmatics – explicature and implicature (Car-
ston, 2002):

The pragmatic actions can be captured by Le-
vinson’s (2000) heuristics, whose application
gives rise to default interpretations by evoking
certain inferences. The heuristics and their corre-
sponding inferences are based on Grice’s Max-
ims of Conversation: Q-heuristics are based on
the first quantity maxim (‘make your statement
as informative as possible’) and license inference
to the negation or invalidity of a corresponding
stronger expression, M-heuristics stem from vio-
lations of the manner maxim (esp. ‘avoid obscu-
rity of expression’ and ‘avoid prolixity’), and
license the inference from marked expressions to
marked interpretations. I-heuristics are based on
the second quantity maxim (‘do not say more
than necessary’) and allow for inference to a
stereotype. Contrary to the Gricean view, how-
ever, these are assumed to work partly also on
the subpropositional level giving rise to ‘explica-
tures’ (Carston, 2002), thereby enriching and
constraining the underspecified lexical represen-
tation.
An advantage of using heuristics giving rise to
default interpretations is that they capture the fact
that real minds have to make decisions under
constraints of limited time and knowledge. In
hand-ling tasks like interpretation, humans have
to use approximate methods like heuristics that
guide the search and determine when it should
end, and simple decision rules that make use of
the information found. To behave adaptively in
the environment in general, and in interpreting
utterances in special, humans must be able to
make inferences that are fast, frugal and accurate
(Gigerenzer et al., 1999). These inferences, or the
heuristics they are based on, respectively, work
well insofar as they make a tradeoff on the di-
mension of generality vs. specificity. Their sim-
plicity allows them to be robust when confronted
with a change in environment and to generalize
to new situations. Such heuristics are rather suit-
able means for dealing with underspecified,
sense-general linguistic expressions that equally
make a tradeoff between underdetermination and
preciseness. Furthermore, heuristics are of the
kind NLP applications can deal with (section 4).
Levinson’s heuristics, at least the M- and Q-
heuristics, are instances of such fast and frugal
heuristics that give rise to default inferences
which have to be made more specific in the
course of interpretation. This is achieved by the
rather specific I-heuristics, that give rise to infer-
ences by referring to assumptions provided by a
concept being activated by a lexical item in a
certain context and discourse setting.

This variety makes it difficult to capture the
semantics of ipf with one invariant meaning.
Postulating polysemy does not solve the problem
either, as this would presuppose the existence of
a clearly defined number of discrete readings.
This is indeed not the case, in view of the ongo-
ing debat about how many and which readings to
postulate. Instead, ipf is best considered as an
instance of ‘sense-generality’ (Atlas 1989), i.e. as
having a definite, but highly general meaning
that is specified in the course of interpretation by
means of context and pragmatic inference.
Sense-generality and pragmatic inference consti-
tute the semantic and pragmatic side of utterance
interpretation: “[...] Grice’s pragmatics without
sense-generality is blind, and sense-generality
without Grice’s pragmatics is empty” (Atlas,
1989: 149).
Accordingly, this paper aims at explaining the
derivation of ipf readings by a more pragmati-
cally oriented account, based on a ‘selectional
theory’ of aspect (Bickel, 1996).

3.1 Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9501075">
As regards semantics, aspect is assumed to con-
tribute to the finite part of an utterance in select-
ing a certain part of the descriptive content of the
verb and relating it to the time an assertion is
made about, the topic time TT (Klein, 1995). The
relation thus obtained constitutes the aspectual
value. The decisive units for this selection are
phases and boundaries (Bickel, 1996). Presuming
a tripartite event structure (Moens and Steedman,
1988) consisting of a preparation phase (dynamic
phase ϕdyn), a culmination point (boundary τ) and
a consequent state (static phase ϕstat), there are
three possibilities for aspect to select. English
and Turkish both have ϕdyn-selecting aspectual
markers, Turkish also a marker for explicit ϕstat-
selection; Russian pf aspect explicitly selects τ.
The unmarked members of the aspectual opposi-
tions may assert anything else – Russian ipf as-
pect may assert anything but the explicit
selection of a boundary.
As truth-evaluation and assertion have to be
kept apart, the selected and asserted parts have to
be related an interval of time, the validation in-
terval, where they are asserted to hold and truth-
conditionally evaluated. Padučeva (1996) refers
to this interval with the notion of točka otsčeta
(henceforth TO), an aspectual reference interval,
which can be retrospective or synchronous
(bounded or unbouded) with respect to the as-
serted part. TO is decisive for constraining the
range of possible interpretations of ipf as it clas-
sifies the readings into three groups. In most
cases TO is lexically given, predominantly by
adverbials, and therefore constitutes an essential
contextual feature for the derivation of the rele-
vant reading. Table 1 shows the classification of
ipf readings according to TO2. The ‘relation’
constitutes the aspectual value:

tic skeleton that has to be accompanied and

pragmatics does not apply ‘after’ semantics, but

As already mentioned before, the principles as-
sumed to guide the pragmatic inferencing are the
heuristics proposed by Levinson (2000), which
are assumed to apply also at the subpropositional
level giving rise to ‘explicatures’ (Carston, 2002)
that enrich and constrain underspecified lexical
representations to yield full-fledged propositions.
Q-inferences are involved in deriving the
meaning of unmarked forms by giving rise to
scalar implicatures from the scale &lt;pf, ipf&gt;,
meaning that if the speaker uses the weaker ele-
ment of the scale (ipf) the hearer is entiteled to
infer the invalidity of the stronger expression
(pf): Using the pf aspect explicitly marks the se-
lection of a boundary, using the ipf does not ex-
clude that selection and thus gives rise to the

a look at Turkish which has morphological means to express the respective
relation (cf. Sonnenhauser, 2003).
three possible values stated above in table 1. This
pragmatically derived meaning of ipf is captured
by the metavariable ‘IPF’, that comprises the
possibilities for ipf listed in table 1. By contex-
tual, discourse pragmatic or general pragmatic
principles (which fix TO), this metavariable gets
disambiguated as to what kind of relation it ex-
presses. As one TO allows for several readings
(cf. 2a-c), the relation obtained by the disam-
biguation is sense-general and needs further en-
richment to yield the contextually relevant
reading. This process is an instance of the draw-
ing of I-inferences referring to a certain concept.
Encyclopaedic knowledge makes certain
assumptions more likely than others, and if these
assumptions lead to a relevant interpretation, all
other lines of interpretation are dismissed. Often
encountered concepts are more likely to get ac-
cessed, as they require less effort in getting acti-
vated.

The insertion of i (‘also’) in (2c), however,

The reasoning stops as soon as a relevant in-
terpretation is achieved.
Note that lexical content of the verb and as-
pect strictly have to be kept apart; ipf requires a
certain input and if a verb is only providing a τ in
its semantic representation, the required phase
has to be induced – again, by means of context or
pragmatic reasoning. This may result in an itera-
tive reading, or in ‘zooming in’ in the (inferred)
preparation phase ϕdyn, (cf. 3a-b; cf. also 9a-b

The application of the ipf in (3b) requires a

‘zooming in’ on it, e.g. in a context fixing a cer-

This coercion process is to be located at the
transition from 1 to 2 (figure 2) and may be cap-
tured in terms of M-inferences: marked expre-
ssions warn ‘marked situation’. Again, we are
dealing with an interaction of implicature and
explicature: ‘Marked situation’ is the implica-
ture, that gives rise to the explicatures that ex-

a relevant reading, i.e. steps 2 and 3 are carried
out as in the non-coercion case. Note further that

Q- and M-inferences differ crucially from I-
inferences in that the latter arise from the inter-
play of semantic representation with context,
while Q- and M-inferences do not need any con-
text for derivation, but are based on sets of alter-
nates with essentially the same form and
contrastive semantic content in the case of Q-
inferences, and with contrasting forms but essen-
tially the same inherent semantic content in the
case of M-inferences. That is, Q- and M-
inferences can be drawn on the basis of what is
lexically given and on the sets of possible alter-
nates. They give rise to utterance-type meaning
as they are based on general expectations on how
language is normally used (Levinson, 2000).
This property is useful for NLP applications as
will be shown in section 4 below. It is due to this
difference, that Q-/M- and I-implicatures come
into play at different levels of meaning composi-
tion, inference and interpretation.
Figure 2 sketches the pragmatic processes in-
volved in the derivation of the specific readings.
What becomes obvious from figure 2 is the fact
that there is one level at which ambiguity is to be
postulated and one level where we are dealing
with sense-generality: The three relations the IPF
meta-variable may give rise to are instances of
ambiguity; the disambiguated relations, however,
are still sense-general and have to be further
specified in the course of interpretation. Once
detected, the ambiguity is easy to handle, as in
most cases it gets disambiguated by lexical
means specifying TO. The specification of the
sense-generality involved is more difficult to
deal with.

3.3 Interaction

<bodyText confidence="0.999959259259259">
What has been outlined so far suggests that a
more pragmatically oriented analyses of closed
classes of morphems, aspect in the present case,
yields interesting insights and resolves puzzles
that arise from the apparently elusive and vari-
able content of these expressions (Levinson,
2000: 98).
Much of the confusion within aspectology,
and presumably within further grammatical cate-
gories, arises due to a neglect of pragmatics and
to definitions of aspect that take pragmatic infer-
ences as part of its semantics (Bickel, 1996). The
division of labour advocated in this paper keeps
the semantics of aspect rather simple, but has to
be supported by general pragmatic principles.
Such an analysis is cross-linguistically applicable
and facilitates systematic comparison of different
aspectual systems. Furthermore, such a simple
semantics provides a suitable input for NLP ap-
plications.
The division of labour between semantics and
pragmatics, i.e. the relation between the input
provided by the lexicon and the contribution of
pragmatic reasoning, varies from language to
language, but the semantics stated in the selec-
tional theory, and the inferential heuristics them-
selves remain stable across languages.

4 Implications for NLP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958111111111">
Without a principled account of pragmatic, i.e.
inferential, principles, applications in natural lan-
guage processing will necessarily fail. This
means, that the lexically given facts currently
being processed have to be combined with in-
formation from former parse-states – as the in-
terpretation is modelled as processing
incrementally from left to right (Kempson et al.,
2001) –, with general heuristics of pragmatic rea-
soning and with access to conceptual knowledge.
To make the findings so fare suitable for NLP,
the decisive input factors have to be stated as
well as the principles of their interaction. Con-
trary to human interpretation of underspecified
forms, where meaning is constructed predomi-
nantly by abductive reasoning, in computer
driven interpretation meanings have to be se-
lected from an a priori established list of possi-
bilities (cf. Sonnenhauser, 2004). For ipf this
means that a list of readings has to be compiled
(see table 1), the factors involved their derivation
have to be fixed and rules of interaction have to
be stated that can be expressed in the deductive,
propositional logic form A → B (cf. Vazov and
Lapalme, 2000), where A is the premise, i.e. it
states the conditions for the rules to apply, and B
the conclusion, i.e. the derived reading.

tual partner in disambiguating IPF. As it is in
most cases lexically given, adverbials are to be
annotated as to what kind of TO they fix.
To capture M-inferences, the default combina-
tions of base and selector have to be stated, as
well as rules for resolving possibly occurring
mismatches. The M-inferences then can be
pinned down by coercion operators (Pulman,
1997; Thomas and Pulman, 1999). As pointed
out above, the metalinguistic Q- and M-
inferences can be handeled purley on the basis of
the lexically given input and on the basis of the
possible alternatives that have to be stated as
well.
The presumably most difficult problem is how
to specify verbs for the conceptual knowledge
they provide access to, which is indespensable
for I-inference to be drawn. One means is corpus
analysis in order to detect regularities and
coocurrences of lexical items that might hint to a
conceptual connection5. As the factor ‘probabil-
ity’ cannot be completely eliminated, a condition
has to be implemented preferring the shortest line
of reasoning (Thomas and Pulman, 1999).
Furthermore, a mechanism must be imple-
mented that parallels the stop mechanism in hu-
man interpretation, i.e. a mechanism that stops
the search for information to be built in in the
interpretation process. The reasoning stops as
soon a truth-conditional interpretation is
achieved, i.e. as soon as the requirement for that
propositional content is achieved. It is this re-
quirement that crucially drives the interpretation
process (cf. the requirement ‘?Ty(t)’ in the Dy-
namic Syntax approach as advocated by
Kempson et al., 2001).
Interpretation of aspectual forms processes in-
crementally, i.e. information once provided and
processed cannot be undone.

Depending on the semantic representation of
the verb, implicatures or presuppositions may
arise. Ipf with the structure [(p z] leaves the
reaching of the boundary as an implicature, ipf
with [z (p] leaves the initial boundary as presup-
position. That is how the semantic representa-
tions of verbs provide background and frame for
pragmatic reasoning.

4.3 The ‘coercion’ case

<bodyText confidence="0.947686857142857">
Whenever an aspectual marker is applied on a
basis not providing the relevant feature (ϕ or τ)
for it to apply, that feature is semantically or
pragmatically induced in order to eliminate that
mismatch. Coercion operators capture this re-
categorization process (Pulman, 1997):
9a. Ivan vyigral gonku.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.235369">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961447661538462">
‘Ivan won the race.’
Here, pf is applied to a verb that provides a τ;
no coercion is necessary.
9b. Ivan vyigryval gonku (četyre raza).
Ivan win: PAST:ipf race:ACC (four times).
‘Ivan won the race four times / was winning
the race.’
The application of ipf in (9b) requires a ϕ,
which the verb vyigrat´ (‘win’) does not provide.
So it has to be induced by iteration or by zoom-
ing in on ϕdyn. Two coercion operators may be
applied: “iterate / stretch: point → process”
(Pulman, 1997). In most cases, context provides
the necessary cues for disambiguation (e.g. an
iterative adverbials or a when-clause), if not, one
has to rely on the ‘probability-condition’.
9c. V vosem časov ona uže vyšla.
at eight o´clock she already leave:PAST:pf
‘At eight o´clock, she had already left.’
(= she was gone)
For the consequent-state reading in (9c) to
arise, the prefix vy- first has to induce the bound-
ary required for pf to apply. Uže (‘already’) here
triggers the application of the coercion operator
“add-cstate: X → &lt;X, state&gt;, where X is point or
process” (Pulman 1997). The rules for (9b) are:
10a. IF ipf is applied to a verb providing no
phase, AND a lexical item indicating itera-
tion is present
THEN induce the phase by application of
‘ite-rate’
10b. IF ipf is applied to a verb providing no phase
AND and adverbial/clause indicating inci-
dence is present
THEN induce the phase by application of
‘stretch’
The application of ipf onto a verbal basis pro-
viding merely a τ (prior to coercion) is both prag-
matically and morphologically marked, but ipf
does not lose its semantic unmarkedness. Though
interpretation in terms of coercion is composi-
tional, the specific reading this coercion gives
gives rise to depends on linguistic context and
world-knowledge (de Swart, 1998); cf. (11)7:
11. On rešal zadaču.

11a. actual-processual reading
‘He was solving the exercise.’
11b. conative reading
‘He tried to solve the exercise.’
11c. general-factual reading
‘He (*solved)8 the exercise.’
Whereas (11c) can be disambiguated by fixing
TO as retrospective, (11a) and (11b) cannot be
distinguished by TO alone as both require it to be
synchronous. The distinction between the possi-
ble readings is left to contextual disambiguation
and world-knowledge. Gaining probability val-
ues and assigning them to interpretations by a
statistical approach taking into account judge-
ments of native speakers seems to be a possible
way (cf. Glovinskaja, 1982 for the habitual, po-
tential and actual-processual reading), but the
probability rankings can be overriden by the lexi-
cal content of verbal phrases.

The framework presented here allows for taking
also pragmatic reasoning processes into account
in computing interpretations. Without a princi-
pled account of inferential principles NLP appli-
cations have to fail. The rather sketchy picture
presented here might serve as a starting point for
identifying semantic and pragmatic factors in the
aspecto-temporal system of Russian. A lot of
problems remain to be solved. Corpus analyses
and the appropriate annotation of verbs, aspect
markers and adverbials are the prerequisite for
formulating rules that enable the systematic deri-
vation and computation of the readings. Further-
more, the interaction of the different factors has
to be studied in a wider domain, i.e. on the para-
graph level.
The selection-theoretic and pragmatic assump-
tions outlined in this paper can be claimed to be
cross-linguistically valid, but languages differ in
their respective contribution of semantics and

<abstract confidence="0.985487234042553">One main problem for NLP applications is that natural language expressions are underspecified and require enrichments of different sorts to get a truthconditional interpretaton in context. Underspecification applies on two levels: what is said underdetermines what is meant, and linguistic meaning underspecifies what is said. One instance of this phenomenon is aspect in Russian, especially the imperfective one. It gives rise to a variety of readings, which are difficult to capture by one invariant meaning. Instead, the imperfective aspect is sense-general; its meaning has to be specified in the course of interpretation by contextual cues and pragmatic inferences. This paper advocates an account of the different imperfective readings in terms of pragmatic principles and inferential heuristics based on, and supplied by, a semantic skeleton consisting of a ‘selectional theory’ of aspect. This framework might serve as basis for a rule-guided derivation of aspectual readings in Russian. 1 Linguistic underspecification Natural language expressions deliver merely templates for the construction of a contextually relevant interpretation, namely the propositional meaning the hearer ascribes to the respective perceived utterance. What is linguistically given delivers only part of the input necessary for interpretation and has to be enriched and specified by recourse to sentence-level and discourse-level context, as well as to world-knowledge. Propositions, i.e. truth-conditional content, arise only after that enrichment process has taken place. NLP applications need to capture the meaning of a linguistic input to adequately work with it in the respective applications. But the ‘meaning’ relevant in this case, viz. the intended interpretation of an utterance, is underspecified by the lexically given input in at least two ways. Linguistic meaning underspecifies propositions, i.e. ‘what is said’ (Carston, 2002), and ‘what is said’ in turn underspecifies ‘what is meant’ (Grice, 1989). Both kinds of underspecification have to be solved by the hearer in natural discourse settings, and by the corresonding algorithms in NLP-applications. As such applications necessarily rely on linguistically given input, they have to be supplemented by a systematic account of the inferential mechanisms needed to enrich and specify the lexical schemes. A further difficulty for NLP applications is that, presuming some form of cooperativity, any utterance can be interpreted by appropriately accommodating the context. Apparently, computing the contextually relevant interpretation of an utterance requires more than capturing and computing lexical input. It relies crucially on further information and principles of how to derive that information and combine it with what is lexically given. Information – contextual or conceptual – that is not contained in the natural language string currently being processed is subject to pragmatic actions (Perrett, 2000: 102). paper is organized as follows: 2 illustrates the assumptions on pragmatic reasonrelevant here. 3 with Russian ipf aspect as one example of linguistic underspecification and sketches the semantics and involved in the derivation of its read- Implications for NLP will be given in secand 5 a short conclusion. 2 Pragmatic Reasoning The twofold underspecification of natural language expressions is resolved by pragmatic reasoning: ‘implicatures’, derived by inference alone, enrich what is said to what is meant and ‘explicatures’, derived by decoding plus inference, enrich the lexical input to what is said. Both interact in mutual parallel adjustment, in that the expectation of certain implicatures constrains the possible range of explicatures. Thus, we are dealing with two kinds of semantics – lexical and propositonal – and with two kinds of pragmatics – explicature and implicature (Carston, 2002): Lexical Truth-cond. Explic.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.998334648424546">The pragmatic actions can be captured by Levinson’s (2000) heuristics, whose application gives rise to default interpretations by evoking certain inferences. The heuristics and their corresponding inferences are based on Grice’s Maxims of Conversation: Q-heuristics are based on the first quantity maxim (‘make your statement as informative as possible’) and license inference to the negation or invalidity of a corresponding stronger expression, M-heuristics stem from violations of the manner maxim (esp. ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ and ‘avoid prolixity’), and license the inference from marked expressions to marked interpretations. I-heuristics are based on the second quantity maxim (‘do not say more than necessary’) and allow for inference to a stereotype. Contrary to the Gricean view, however, these are assumed to work partly also on the subpropositional level giving rise to ‘explicatures’ (Carston, 2002), thereby enriching and constraining the underspecified lexical representation. An advantage of using heuristics giving rise to default interpretations is that they capture the fact that real minds have to make decisions under constraints of limited time and knowledge. In hand-ling tasks like interpretation, humans have to use approximate methods like heuristics that guide the search and determine when it should end, and simple decision rules that make use of the information found. To behave adaptively in the environment in general, and in interpreting utterances in special, humans must be able to make inferences that are fast, frugal and accurate (Gigerenzer et al., 1999). These inferences, or the heuristics they are based on, respectively, work well insofar as they make a tradeoff on the dimension of generality vs. specificity. Their simplicity allows them to be robust when confronted with a change in environment and to generalize to new situations. Such heuristics are rather suitable means for dealing with underspecified, sense-general linguistic expressions that equally make a tradeoff between underdetermination and preciseness. Furthermore, heuristics are of the NLP applications can deal with Levinson’s heuristics, at least the Mand Qheuristics, are instances of such fast and frugal heuristics that give rise to default inferences which have to be made more specific in the course of interpretation. This is achieved by the rather specific I-heuristics, that give rise to inferences by referring to assumptions provided by a concept being activated by a lexical item in a certain context and discourse setting. 3 Ipf aspect in Russian One instance of underspecification is aspect in especially the which gives rise to a considerable variety of readings (1a-g). Their context-dependence and defeasibility indicates their partial pragmatic character. 1a. actual-processual reading Šar medlenno podnimalsja. slowly ‘The balloon was ascending slowly.’ 1b. inactual reading Ran´še on rabotal v universitete. the past he ‘He used to work as a teacher.’ 1c. general-factual reading na stene visela kartina. at that ‘There was a painting hanging on that wall.’ 1d. durative reading Ona dolgo smotrela na fotografii. for a long time ‘She looked at the photos for a long time.’ 1e. atemporal reading Železo tonet v vode. go ‘Iron goes down in water.’ 1‘ipf’ = (Russian) imperfective aspect; ‘pf’ = (Russian) perfective aspect 1f. potential reading Chorošij byl slesar´: ljubye zamki otkryval. lock:Pl ‘He was a good locksmith: he could open every door.’ 1g. habitual reading Po subbotam, ona chodila v banju. saturday, she sauna ‘She used to go to the sauna on Saturdays.’ This variety makes it difficult to capture the semantics of ipf with one invariant meaning. Postulating polysemy does not solve the problem either, as this would presuppose the existence of a clearly defined number of discrete readings. This is indeed not the case, in view of the ongoing debat about how many and which readings to postulate. Instead, ipf is best considered as an instance of ‘sense-generality’ (Atlas 1989), i.e. as having a definite, but highly general meaning that is specified in the course of interpretation by means of context and pragmatic inference. Sense-generality and pragmatic inference constitute the semantic and pragmatic side of utterance interpretation: “[...] Grice’s pragmatics without sense-generality is blind, and sense-generality without Grice’s pragmatics is empty” (Atlas, 1989: 149). Accordingly, this paper aims at explaining the derivation of ipf readings by a more pragmatically oriented account, based on a ‘selectional theory’ of aspect (Bickel, 1996). 3.1 Semantics As regards semantics, aspect is assumed to contribute to the finite part of an utterance in selecting a certain part of the descriptive content of the verb and relating it to the time an assertion is made about, the topic time TT (Klein, 1995). The relation thus obtained constitutes the aspectual value. The decisive units for this selection are phases and boundaries (Bickel, 1996). Presuming a tripartite event structure (Moens and Steedman, 1988) consisting of a preparation phase (dynamic a culmination point (boundary and consequent state (static phase there are three possibilities for aspect to select. English Turkish both have aspectual Turkish also a marker for explicit Russian pf aspect explicitly selects The unmarked members of the aspectual oppositions may assert anything else – Russian ipf aspect may assert anything but the explicit selection of a boundary. As truth-evaluation and assertion have to be kept apart, the selected and asserted parts have to be related an interval of time, the validation interval, where they are asserted to hold and truthevaluated. (1996) refers this interval with the notion of (henceforth TO), an aspectual reference interval, which can be retrospective or synchronous (bounded or unbouded) with respect to the asserted part. TO is decisive for constraining the range of possible interpretations of ipf as it classifies the readings into three groups. In most cases TO is lexically given, predominantly by adverbials, and therefore constitutes an essential contextual feature for the derivation of the relereading. 1 the classification of readings according to The ‘relation’ constitutes the aspectual value: TO Relation Reading of the ipf synchronous, bounded TT included in actual-processual synchronous, non-bounded TT habitual, ous potential, τ atemporal retrospective TT general-factual, dura- τ tive Table 1. A classification of ipf readings What has been said so far provides the semantic skeleton that has to be accompanied and fleshed out by pragmatic reasoning. Note, that pragmatics does not apply ‘after’ semantics, but rather interleaves with it. 3.2 Pragmatics As already mentioned before, the principles assumed to guide the pragmatic inferencing are the heuristics proposed by Levinson (2000), which are assumed to apply also at the subpropositional level giving rise to ‘explicatures’ (Carston, 2002) that enrich and constrain underspecified lexical representations to yield full-fledged propositions. Q-inferences are involved in deriving the meaning of unmarked forms by giving rise to scalar implicatures from the scale &lt;pf, ipf&gt;, meaning that if the speaker uses the weaker element of the scale (ipf) the hearer is entiteled to infer the invalidity of the stronger expression (pf): Using the pf aspect explicitly marks the selection of a boundary, using the ipf does not exclude that selection and thus gives rise to the 2That it is indeed reasonable to distinguish these three groups is supported by a look at Turkish which has morphological means to express the respective relation (cf. Sonnenhauser, 2003). possible values stated above in This pragmatically derived meaning of ipf is captured the metavariable that comprises the for ipf listed in By contextual, discourse pragmatic or general pragmatic principles (which fix TO), this metavariable gets disambiguated as to what kind of relation it expresses. As one TO allows for several readings (cf. 2a-c), the relation obtained by the disambiguation is sense-general and needs further enrichment to yield the contextually relevant reading. This process is an instance of the drawing of I-inferences referring to a certain concept. Encyclopaedic knowledge makes certain assumptions more likely than others, and if these assumptions lead to a relevant interpretation, all other lines of interpretation are dismissed. Often encountered concepts are more likely to get accessed, as they require less effort in getting activated. 2a. Moj otec govoril po-turecki. father ‘My father could speak Turkish.’ 2b. govoril po-turecki. ‘The translator was speaking Turkish.’ As the potential reading (2a) is not relevant with (2b) – translators are supposed to be able to speak a certain language –, other interpretations are looked for, here the actual-processual. 2c. govoril i po-turecki. Turkish ‘The translator could also speak Turkish.’ insertion of in (2c), however, creates the appropriate context for the potential reading to be relevant. The reasoning stops as soon as a relevant interpretation is achieved. Note that lexical content of the verb and aspect strictly have to be kept apart; ipf requires a input and if a verb is only providing a its semantic representation, the required phase has to be induced – again, by means of context or pragmatic reasoning. This may result in an iterative reading, or in ‘zooming in’ in the (inferred) phase (cf. 3a-b; cf. also 9a-b below): vyigral gonku. ‘Ivan won the race.’ pf is applied to a verb that provides a boundary in its semantic representation and therefore no interpretational rearrangements are necessary. vyigryval gonku raza). win: times. ‘Ivan won the race four times / was winning the race.’ The application of the ipf in (3b) requires a the verb does not provide one, thus it has to be induced by iteration, or by inferring and ‘zooming in’ on it, e.g. in a context fixing a cermoment e.g. a This coercion process is to be located at the from 1 to 2 and may be captured in terms of M-inferences: marked expressions warn ‘marked situation’. Again, we are dealing with an interaction of implicature and explicature: ‘Marked situation’ is the implicature, that gives rise to the explicatures that exthe of the situation in deriving a relevant reading, i.e. steps 2 and 3 are carried out as in the non-coercion case. Note further that this reasoning process is not carried out step by step, but in parallel adjustment, which may be modelled within a game-theoretic framwork or SENSE- IPF ττ 1) inference alone 2) disambiguation decoding + inference propositional level: Implicature parallel adjustment I actualprocessual II habitual, cotinuous, potential, permanent, atemporal III general-factual, durative enrichment level: + inference Figure 2. Pragmatic reasoning behind the derivation of ipf readings pragmatic markedness has o be distinguished within bidirectional optimality theory. Qand M-inferences differ crucially from Iinferences in that the latter arise from the interplay of semantic representation with context, while Qand M-inferences do not need any context for derivation, but are based on sets of alternates with essentially the same form and contrastive semantic content in the case of Qinferences, and with contrasting forms but essentially the same inherent semantic content in the case of M-inferences. That is, Qand Minferences can be drawn on the basis of what is lexically given and on the sets of possible alternates. They give rise to utterance-type meaning as they are based on general expectations on how language is normally used (Levinson, 2000). This property is useful for NLP applications as be shown in 4 It is due to this difference, that Q-/Mand I-implicatures come into play at different levels of meaning composition, inference and interpretation. 2 the pragmatic processes involved in the derivation of the specific readings. becomes obvious from 2 the fact that there is one level at which ambiguity is to be postulated and one level where we are dealing sense-generality: The three relations the meta-variable may give rise to are instances of ambiguity; the disambiguated relations, however, are still sense-general and have to be further specified in the course of interpretation. Once detected, the ambiguity is easy to handle, as in most cases it gets disambiguated by lexical means specifying TO. The specification of the sense-generality involved is more difficult to deal with. 3.3 Interaction What has been outlined so far suggests that a more pragmatically oriented analyses of closed classes of morphems, aspect in the present case, yields interesting insights and resolves puzzles that arise from the apparently elusive and variable content of these expressions (Levinson, 2000: 98). Much of the confusion within aspectology, and presumably within further grammatical categories, arises due to a neglect of pragmatics and to definitions of aspect that take pragmatic inferences as part of its semantics (Bickel, 1996). The division of labour advocated in this paper keeps the semantics of aspect rather simple, but has to be supported by general pragmatic principles. Such an analysis is cross-linguistically applicable and facilitates systematic comparison of different aspectual systems. Furthermore, such a simple semantics provides a suitable input for NLP applications. The division of labour between semantics and pragmatics, i.e. the relation between the input provided by the lexicon and the contribution of pragmatic reasoning, varies from language to language, but the semantics stated in the selectional theory, and the inferential heuristics themselves remain stable across languages. 4 Implications for NLP Without a principled account of pragmatic, i.e. inferential, principles, applications in natural language processing will necessarily fail. This means, that the lexically given facts currently being processed have to be combined with information from former parse-states – as the interpretation is modelled as processing incrementally from left to right (Kempson et al., 2001) –, with general heuristics of pragmatic reasoning and with access to conceptual knowledge. To make the findings so fare suitable for NLP, the decisive input factors have to be stated as well as the principles of their interaction. Contrary to human interpretation of underspecified forms, where meaning is constructed predominantly by abductive reasoning, in computer driven interpretation meanings have to be selected from an a priori established list of possibilities (cf. Sonnenhauser, 2004). For ipf this means that a list of readings has to be compiled the factors involved their derivation have to be fixed and rules of interaction have to be stated that can be expressed in the deductive, logic form Vazov and Lapalme, 2000), where A is the premise, i.e. it states the conditions for the rules to apply, and B the conclusion, i.e. the derived reading. 4.1 The input Input factors for algorithms are the following: indexed for the lexiitems indexed for whether they add and aspectual selectors indexed for what they select and for their status within the language specific semantic markedness relation. That is how Q-inferences are drawn. TO constrains the interpretations of the unmarked aspec- 4Languages differ as to whether this lexical specification already gives rise to ‘default aspect’ (Bohnemeyer and Swift, 2001) as in Russian, or not, as in Turkish. partner in disambiguating As it is in most cases lexically given, adverbials are to be annotated as to what kind of TO they fix. To capture M-inferences, the default combinations of base and selector have to be stated, as well as rules for resolving possibly occurring mismatches. The M-inferences then can be pinned down by coercion operators (Pulman, 1997; Thomas and Pulman, 1999). As pointed out above, the metalinguistic Qand Minferences can be handeled purley on the basis of the lexically given input and on the basis of the possible alternatives that have to be stated as well. The presumably most difficult problem is how to specify verbs for the conceptual knowledge they provide access to, which is indespensable for I-inference to be drawn. One means is corpus analysis in order to detect regularities and coocurrences of lexical items that might hint to a As the factor ‘probability’ cannot be completely eliminated, a condition has to be implemented preferring the shortest line of reasoning (Thomas and Pulman, 1999). Furthermore, a mechanism must be implemented that parallels the stop mechanism in human interpretation, i.e. a mechanism that stops the search for information to be built in in the interpretation process. The reasoning stops as soon a truth-conditional interpretation is achieved, i.e. as soon as the requirement for that propositional content is achieved. It is this requirement that crucially drives the interpretation process (cf. the requirement ‘?Ty(t)’ in the Dynamic Syntax approach as advocated by Kempson et al., 2001). Interpretation of aspectual forms processes incrementally, i.e. information once provided and processed cannot be undone. 4.2 The ‘default’ case default case is a match of basis and where the verbal basis provides the necessary input for the marker to apply. For ipf, the conditions have to be stated under which the three posget activated. Here, TO – primarily specified by temporal or manner ad- (e.g. bol´še and more’, – is decisive. Adverbials of car- 5Assuming an associative organization of memory, where related things are probabilistically associated reflecting generalizations about regularities in an organism’s perception of and interaction with its environment (Robinson, 1997), this statistical approach indeed seems to be on the right track. 6‘Marker’ is the general term that subsumes also cases of default aspect, where there is no overt morphological marking, as frequently encountered in Russian. dinality and duration fix TO as retrospective and reading as being out of The rule for this line of interpretation can be stated as follows (adopted from Vazov and Lapalme, 2000): is applied to a verb providing a phase there is an adverbial fixing TO as retrospective reading is out of group III. 5a. general-factual reading uže rasskazyval vam already ‘I already told you this story.’ 5b. durative reading Ja guljala ot trech to pjati. three:Gen to five:Gen ‘From three to five, I went for a walk.’ Both interpretations can be overridden if TO is turned into a synchronous one by adverbials of type or 6a. habitual reading guljala ot trech to pjati. usually three to five ‘I usually went for a walk from three to five.’ This shows the incremental way of interpretation, whereby the inner parts are left intact: 6b.

That is how the semantic representations of verbs provide background and frame for pragmatic reasoning. 4.3 The ‘coercion’ case Whenever an aspectual marker is applied on a not providing the relevant feature for it to apply, that feature is semantically or pragmatically induced in order to eliminate that mismatch.

Ivan vyigryval gonku raza). win: times). ‘Ivan won the race four times / was winning the race.’ application of ipf in (9b) requires a the verb (‘win’) does not provide. So it has to be induced by iteration or by zoomin on Two coercion operators may be “iterate / stretch: point (Pulman, 1997). In most cases, context provides the necessary cues for disambiguation (e.g. an adverbials or a if not, one has to rely on the ‘probability-condition’. V vosem ona uže vyšla. eight o´clock she already ‘At eight o´clock, she had already left.’ (= she was gone) For the consequent-state reading in (9c) to the prefix first has to induce the boundrequired for pf to apply. here triggers the application of the coercion operator X state&gt;, where X is point or process” (Pulman 1997). The rules for (9b) are: IF is applied to a verb providing no lexical item indicating iteration is present the phase by application of IF is applied to a verb providing no phase adverbial/clause indicating incidence is present the phase by application of The application of ipf onto a verbal basis promerely a to coercion) is both pragmatically and morphologically marked, but ipf does not lose its semantic unmarkedness. Though interpretation in terms of coercion is compositional, the specific reading this coercion gives gives rise to depends on linguistic context and (de Swart, 1998); cf. rešal 11a. actual-processual reading ‘He was solving the exercise.’ 11b. conative reading ‘He tried to solve the exercise.’ 11c. general-factual reading the exercise.’ Whereas (11c) can be disambiguated by fixing TO as retrospective, (11a) and (11b) cannot be distinguished by TO alone as both require it to be synchronous. The distinction between the possible readings is left to contextual disambiguation and world-knowledge. Gaining probability values and assigning them to interpretations by a statistical approach taking into account judgements of native speakers seems to be a possible way (cf. Glovinskaja, 1982 for the habitual, potential and actual-processual reading), but the probability rankings can be overriden by the lexical content of verbal phrases. 5 Concluding remarks The framework presented here allows for taking also pragmatic reasoning processes into account in computing interpretations. Without a principled account of inferential principles NLP applications have to fail. The rather sketchy picture presented here might serve as a starting point for identifying semantic and pragmatic factors in the aspecto-temporal system of Russian. A lot of problems remain to be solved. Corpus analyses and the appropriate annotation of verbs, aspect markers and adverbials are the prerequisite for formulating rules that enable the systematic derivation and computation of the readings. Furthermore, the interaction of the different factors has to be studied in a wider domain, i.e. on the paragraph level. The selection-theoretic and pragmatic assumptions outlined in this paper can be claimed to be cross-linguistically valid, but languages differ in their respective contribution of semantics and general pragmatic reasonig. This approach, that combines generality of linguistic expressions with systematic pragmatic principles, can be extended to further instances of grammatical underspecification.

Postulating polysemy does not solve the problem either, as this would presuppose the existence of a clearly defined number of discrete readings. This is indeed not the case, in view of the ongoing debat about how many and which readings to postulate. Instead, ipf is best considered as an instance of ‘sense-generality’ (Atlas 1989), i.e. as having a definite, but highly general meaning that is specified in the course of interpretation by means of context and pragmatic inference.

Such an analysis is cross-linguistically applicable and facilitates systematic comparison of different aspectual systems.

Propositions, i.e. truth-conditional content, arise only after that enrichment process has taken place. NLP applications need to capture the meaning of a linguistic input to adequately work with it in the respective applications. But the ‘meaning’ relevant in this case, viz. the intended interpretation of an utterance, is underspecified by the lexically given input in at least two ways. Linguistic meaning underspecifies propositions, i.e. ‘what is said’ (Carston, 2002), and ‘what is said’ in turn underspecifies ‘what is meant’ (Grice, 1989). Both kinds of underspecification have to be solved by the hearer in natural discourse settings, and by the corresonding algorithms in NLP-applications. As such applications necessarily rely on linguistically given input, they have to be supplemented by a systematic account of the inferential mechanisms needed to enrich and specify the lexical schemes. A further difficulty for NLP applications is that, presuming some form of cooperativity, any utterance can be interpreted by appropriately accommodating the context. Appar</context>

Both interact in mutual parallel adjustment, in that the expectation of certain implicatures constrains the possible range of explicatures. Thus, we are dealing with two kinds of semantics – lexical and propositonal – and with two kinds of pragmatics – explicature and implicature (Carston, 2002): Lexical Truthcond.

That is, Q- and Minferences can be drawn on the basis of what is lexically given and on the sets of possible alternates. They give rise to utterance-type meaning as they are based on general expectations on how language is normally used (Levinson, 2000). This property is useful for NLP applications as will be shown in section 4 below. It is due to this difference, that Q-/M- and I-implicatures come into play at different levels of meaning composition, inference and interpretation. Figure 2 sketches the pragmatic processes involved in the derivation of the specific readings.

TO is decisive for constraining the range of possible interpretations of ipf as it classifies the readings into three groups.

A further difficulty for NLP applications is that, presuming some form of cooperativity, any utterance can be interpreted by appropriately accommodating the context. Apparently, computing the contextually relevant interpretation of an utterance requires more than capturing and computing lexical input. It relies crucially on further information and principles of how to derive that information and combine it with what is lexically given. Information – contextual or conceptual – that is not contained in the natural language string currently being processed is subject to pragmatic actions (Perrett, 2000: 102). This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 illustrates the assumptions on pragmatic reasoning relevant here. Section 3 deals with Russian ipf aspect as one example of linguistic underspecification and sketches the semantics and pragmatics involved in the derivation of its readings. Implications for NLP will be given in section 4, and section 5 offers a short conclusion. 2 Pragmatic Reasoning The twofold underspecification of natural language expressions is resolved by pragmatic reasoning: ‘implicatures’, derived by inference alone, enrich what is said to what is meant and ‘explicatu</context>

As it is in most cases lexically given, adverbials are to be annotated as to what kind of TO they fix. To capture M-inferences, the default combinations of base and selector have to be stated, as well as rules for resolving possibly occurring mismatches. The M-inferences then can be pinned down by coercion operators (Pulman, 1997; Thomas and Pulman, 1999). As pointed out above, the metalinguistic Q- and Minferences can be handeled purley on the basis of the lexically given input and on the basis of the possible alternatives that have to be stated as well. The presumably most difficult problem is how to specify verbs for the conceptual knowledge they provide access to, which is indespensable for I-inference to be drawn.

Ipf with the structure [(p z] leaves the reaching of the boundary as an implicature, ipf with [z (p] leaves the initial boundary as presupposition. That is how the semantic representations of verbs provide background and frame for pragmatic reasoning. 4.3 The ‘coercion’ case Whenever an aspectual marker is applied on a basis not providing the relevant feature (ϕ or τ) for it to apply, that feature is semantically or pragmatically induced in order to eliminate that mismatch. Coercion operators capture this recategorization process (Pulman, 1997): 9a. Ivan vyigral gonku. Ivan win:PAST:pf race:ACC ‘Ivan won the race.’ Here, pf is applied to a verb that provides a τ; no coercion is necessary. 9b. Ivan vyigryval gonku (četyre raza). Ivan win: PAST:ipf race:ACC (four times). ‘Ivan won the race four times / was winning the race.’ The application of ipf in (9b) requires a ϕ, which the verb vyigrat´ (‘win’) does not provide. So it has to be induced by iteration or by zooming in on ϕdyn. Two coercion operators may be applied: “iterate / stretch: point → process” (Pulman, 1997). In most cases, context provides the necessary cues for disambigua</context>

This pragmatically derived meaning of ipf is captured by the metavariable ‘IPF’, that comprises the possibilities for ipf listed in table 1. By contextual, discourse pragmatic or general pragmatic principles (which fix TO), this metavariable gets disambiguated as to what kind of relation it expresses. As one TO allows for several readings (cf. 2a-c), the relation obtained by the disambiguation is sense-general and needs further enrichment to yield the contextually relevant reading.
