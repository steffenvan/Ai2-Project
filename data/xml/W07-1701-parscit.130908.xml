<bodyText confidence="0.999753466666667">
Information Extraction (IE) often involves
some amount of partial syntactic processing.
This is clear in cases of interesting high-
level IE tasks, such as finding information
about who did what to whom (when, where,
how and why), but it is also true in case
of simpler IE tasks, such as finding com-
pany names in texts. The aim of this paper is
to give an overview of Slavonic phenomena
which pose particular problems for IE and
partial parsing, and some phenomena which
seem easier to treat in Slavonic than in Ger-
manic or Romance; I also mention various
tools which have been used for the partial
processing of Slavonic.

The aim of this paper is to give a general but rather
biased overview of the problems of Information Ex-
traction (IE) in Slavonic. In particular, I discuss
linguistic phenomena which make IE in Slavonic
harder than in Germanic or Romance, §2, but also
those which seem to make it easier, §3. We will also
look at various general tools which have been used
in IE tasks in the context of Slavonic languages, es-
pecially at tools for partial (or shallow) parsing, §4.
I deal mainly with Polish, as a good representa-
tive of the Slavonic family: although Polish is a rela-
tively large language, with about 44 million native
speakers world-wide (over 38 million in Poland),
the availability of linguistic resources and tools for
this language does not reflect this fact: it compares

There are various characteristics of Slavonic lan-
guages1 that make them more difficult for automatic
processing, whether shallow or deep, than Germanic
and Romance languages.2 The two of them which
are most conspicuous, and identified as most prob-
lematic, e.g., in (Collins et al., 1999), are rich nomi-
nal inflection (§2.1) and free word order (§2.6). Oth-
ers, causing problems to varying extents, include:
idiosyncratic inflection of Slavonic proper names
(§2.2); unstable inflection of some foreign names
(§2.3); high degree of trans- and, especially, intra-
paradigmatic syncretisms (§2.4); and, on the more
syntactic level, the infamous quirkiness of numeral
phrases (NumPs; §2.5).

Ukrainian, Belorussian, Rusyn), West Slavonic (Czech, Slovak,
Upper and Lower Sorbian, Polish, Kashubian) and the Western
subgroup of South Slavonic (Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Slove-

Slavonic (Bulgarian and Macedonian). In this and the next sec-

task of finding some syntactic structure without using lexical
resources such as valence dictionaries; by contrast, deep pro-
cessing involves finding the complete sentence structures with
the use of such lexical resources.

flecting for number (singular and plural; in Slove-
nian and Sorbian also dual), famously inflect for
about 6 (e.g., Russian, Slovenian) or 7 (e.g., Czech,
Croatian, Polish, Ukrainian) cases: the exact number
of cases cited in the literature for any particular lan-
guage often depends on the granularity of descrip-
tion, so Belorussian and Slovak have either 6 or 7
cases, depending on the inclusion in the description
the rare vocative forms, among the 7 Serbian cases,
dative and locative are sometimes conflated because
they “only” differ in accent, the Polish case system
may be extended to 8 cases by postulating the dis-
tributive case (Gruszczy´nski, 1989, p. 89), while the
number of Russian cases may also be reasonably in-
creased to 8 by adding a second genitive and a sec-
ond locative case (Jakobson, 1958).
While for many European languages a dictionary
of lemmata of proper names is sufficient for the task
of NER, (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007, §3.3)
note that “a minimum of morphological treatment”
is required for languages with rich nominal inflec-
tion, such as Balto-Slavonic or Finno-Ugric lan-
guages. Unfortunately, for the majority of Slavonic
languages, there are no (freely) publicly available re-
sources that could provide such “minimum morpho-
logical treatment” of proper names. For example, the
only large free (but not open source) morphologi-
cal analyser for Polish, Morfeusz (Woli´nski, 2006),
contains very few proper names.3 Moreover, the NE
content of commercial analysers is often rather low,
so that simple resource-light heuristics sometimes
give better results (Urba´nska and Mykowiecka,
2005, p. 214). Such heuristics usually involve the
creation of inflected forms by adding typical suffixes
(Popov et al., 2004; Urba´nska and Mykowiecka,
2005; Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007), where the
suffix addition/substitution rules are either hand-
generated (Urba´nska and Mykowiecka, 2005) or
automatically acquired (Steinberger and Pouliquen,
2007).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.7204695">
3A new version of Morfeusz, containing a large dictionary
of proper names, is being prepared, but it is currently not clear
if it is going to be freely available for non-commercial research
purposes (M. Woli´nski, p.c.).

2.2 Different Inflection of Homonymous
Common and Proper Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898916666667">
As mentioned in (Piskorski, 2005) and discussed
at length in (Piskorski et al., 2007b), many Pol-
ish surnames have the same base forms as com-
mon names, for example, GRZYB (lit. ‘mushroom’),
GOŁ ˛AB (lit. ‘pigeon’) or KOWALSKI (lit. an adjec-
tive from ‘smith’). This is a problem in itself in
recognising proper names, but it is further exacer-
bated by the fact that such proper nouns may have
different gender values, and different inflectional
paradigms, than the corresponding common nouns.
For example, while the common nouns GRZYB and
GOŁ ˛AB are, respectively, inanimate masculine and
animate masculine (cf. fn. 5), the corresponding sur-
names are virile or feminine, depending on the de-
notation; in case of singular feminine names, they
would not overtly inflect at all, while in case of sin-
gular masculine or plural uses, the forms are often
different than corresponding common forms, e.g.,
the accusative singular and plural forms of GOŁ ˛AB
would be go~gbia and go~gbie, when used as a com-
mon noun, and Go~ gba and Go~ gbów, when used as
a surname, etc. Obviously, once properly described,
such inflectional differences may actually help in
NER.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994354">
2.3 Difficult Inflection of Foreign Names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999184111111111">
A problem relatively minor in comparison to other
problems discussed here is the inflection of foreign
names: although it is governed by strict prescrip-
tive rules, native speakers are often unaware of them
and different variants of the same form may be en-
countered in text; for example, while in Polish the
correct spelling of the singular instrumental form of
LINUX is Linuksem, the variant Linuxem is at least
as common, and the starkly wrong Linux’em and
Linux-em are also quite frequent. Similarly, proba-
bly few Poles realise that the correct locative forms
of BRANDT and PEIRCE are Brandcie and Peirsie,
and not, say, Brandtcie and Peirce’ie, and that al-
though the locative of REMARQUE is Remarque’u,
the instrumental is Remarkiem.4 A comprehensive
NER should be able to deal with various incorrect
forms of foreign NE occurring in Slavonic texts.
On the other hand, the inflection of proper names

depends on their pronunciation, i.e., on their ori-
gin. For example, the genitive of CHARLES is ei-
ther Charlesa or Charles’a, depending on whether
it is an English name or a French name. Another
example, from (Piskorski et al., 2007b), is WILDE,
whose genitive form is either Wilde’a (English) or
Wildego (German). This feature, when properly en-
coded, may actually help distinguish between enti-
ties in NER.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999816">
2.4 Tagset Size and Syncretisms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988689655172">
A rich inflection system also implies that the size
of the tagset is very large. For example, given that
a Polish nominal form may have one of 2 numbers,
one of 7 cases and one of 5 genders,5 there are 70
possible nominal tags, not counting gerundial and
pronominal forms. In fact, there are 4179 possible
tags in the IPI PAN Tagset of Polish (Przepiórkowski
and Woli´nski, 2003a; Przepiórkowski and Woli´nski,
2003b), of which around 1150 occur in nature
(Przepiórkowski, 2006b). Similarly, sizes of Czech
tagsets range from 1171 (Hajiˇc and Hladká, 1997),
through 1631 (Pala et al., 1998), to theoreti-
cally 4257, but “only” about 1100 actually used
(Mirovský et al., 2002). Such detailed tagsets make
it difficult to reach high accuracy, which — on the
assumption that syntactic parsing is preceded by full
morphosyntactic disambiguation — has negative in-
fluence on syntactic processing.
Another problem connected to the rich inflection
system of Slavonic languages is the large number
of syncretisms. For example, a typical Polish adjec-
tive may have 11 textually different forms (e.g., for
BIAŁY ‘white’: biali, biała, biał ˛a, białe, białego, bi-
ałej, białemu, biały, białych, białym, białymi), but as
many as 70 different tags (2 numbers x 7 cases x 5
genders). There are also various systematic nominal
syncretisms which to some extent annul the advan-
tages that rich case system presents for the identi-
fication of grammatical roles. For example, in plu-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.478362444444444">
5Traditionally, 3 genders were assumed for Polish, as for
many other European languages, but (Ma´nczak, 1956) conclu-
sively shows that at least 5 gender values must be adopted
in Polish: virile (called also m1, personal masculine and hu-
man masculine), animate masculine (m2), inanimate mascu-
line (m3), neuter and feminine. Although this repertoire of gen-
ders was only recently adopted in general dictionaries (Ba´nko,
2000), it is still rather conservative; e.g., (Saloni, 1976) pro-
poses 9 genders.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999569384615385">
ral, Polish non-virile (non-human-masculine) nouns
have the same form in the nominative and in the
accusative, while in the singular, inanimate mascu-
line and neuter forms do. Similarly, virile and an-
imate masculine nouns have the same singular ac-
cusative and singular genitive forms. So, for exam-
ple, in the rather artificial sentence Samochody dwie
minuty wyprzedzaja˛ autobusy ‘(The) cars (for) two
minutes are overtaking (the) buses’, each of samo-
chody, dwie minuty and autobusy may be interpreted
as either nominative or accusative, i.e., as the subject
(nominative), the object (accusative) or a temporal
adjunct (accusative).

2.5 Numeral Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977083541666667">
An area of Slavonic syntax very well-known in
theoretical linguistics is the syntactic behaviour of
NumPs (Corbett, 1978; Franks, 1995); numerals
also turn out to be awkward for automatic process-
ing in various ways.6
First, the case of the noun (phrase) within an
NumP depends on the numeral7 and on the position
of the whole NumP in the sentence. For example,
for NumPs in the subject position, the noun is in the
nominative case, roughly, if the numeral is or ends in
2, 3 or 4 (with the exception of 12, 13 and 14), and it
is genitive otherwise.8 This means that the shallow
processor should recognise as a possible currency
quantity the sequence 152 dolary and 155 dolarów,
but not *152 dolarów or *155 dolary.9
Second, in case of “typical” numerals (not ending
in 2, 3 or 4), the Polish NumP in subject position
does not agree with the verb; instead, the verb oc-
curs in the default 3rd person singular neuter form,10
6One of the largest formal grammars of Polish, (´Swidz-
i´nski, 1992), implemented as a wide coverage deep parser in
(Woli´nski, 2004), does not deal with NumPs at all. Later mod-
ifications of the parser in (Ogrodniczuk, 2006) include some
limited treatment of numerals.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.966967166666667">
7This property turned out to be problematic for adapting the
GF Parallel Resource Grammar to Russian (Khegai, 2006).
8Another exception is JEDEN ‘1’, which is actually an adjec-
tive, rather than a numeral (Przepiórkowski, 2006a). Also, the
description above holds for non-virile genders, but is even more
complicated for virile.
9The latter may occur in contexts like:... według paragrafu
155 dolary nie sa˛ ´srodkiem płatniczym w Polsce ‘... according
to paragraph 155 dollars are not a valid currency in Poland’.
10I argue elsewhere (Przepiórkowski, 1996; Przepiórkowski,
2004b) that such NumPs in subject position actually bear the
accusative case; hence, the lack of agreement.
</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.999244">
which may make discovering the subject-verb rela-
tion more difficult.
Finally, and rather marginally, “typical” NumPs
in copular constructions trigger very atypical agree-
ment with the predicative adjective, e.g.: 40
głosdw było niewa˙znych/niewa˙zne ‘40 votes be-
3RD.SG.NEUT invalid-PL.GEN/ACC’. It is easy to
overlook such constructions when developing a shal-
low grammar, and — since they are rare — it is dif-
ficult to learn them automatically from corpora.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997379">
2.6 Free Word Order
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998385">
Last but certainly not least, the relatively free word
order11 makes the discovering of who did what to
whom (when, where, how and why) much more
difficult than finding the relative order of NPs and
PPs in the sentence. It may seem that the rich case
system may help here, as — with active forms of
verbs — subjects are usually nominative and ob-
jects are often accusative, but matters are much more
complicated because of the widespread syncretisms
mentioned in §2.4, esp. the systematic nominative-
accusative and accusative-genitive syncretisms, and
because both complements and adjuncts may be ex-
pressed by the same cases (e.g., accusative temporal
adjuncts may look like objects of transitive verbs).
While the relatively free word order is seriously
felt in deep parsers and leads to the multiplication of
analyses, to the best of our knowledge most IE work
in Slavonic to date has concentrated on lower-level
tasks such as NER and, hence, has not yet tried to
systematically deal with this problem.

3 Slavonic is Easy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997852590163935">
On a more positive note, the rich Slavonic inflec-
tional system may help at the higher levels of pro-
cessing. There are various linguistic phenomena
where overt case, gender and number agreement
allows to differentiate between interpretations and,
hence, to extract the information about who did what
to whom. To give two trivial constructed examples:
the English sentence I saw him drunk is ambigu-
ous in ways that are necessarily disambiguated by
11Of course, the term free word order as applied to Slavonic
means that the word order is conditioned largely by information
structure (i.e., not really free); modelling the constraints of in-
formation structure on word order is particularly important in
text generation (Kruijff-Korbayová and Kruijff, 1999).
the two Polish translations of that sentence: Widzi-
ałem go pijany ‘(I) saw him drunk-NOM’ and Widzi-
ałem go pijanego ‘(I) saw him drunk-ACC’. Perhaps
more interestingly, the lexical aspect of Slavonic
verbs may make conspicuous the meanings which
are only implicit in other languages, as in the Polish
Skoczył na stdł ‘(He) jumped-PERF on (the) table-
ACC’ versus Skakał na stole ‘(He) jumped-IMPERF
on (the) table-LOC’, both translated into the English
He jumped on the table.
One phenomenon important for high level IE
where the rich inflectional system plays a positive
role, however, is coordination.
Coordination is infamous both in theoretical lin-
guistics and in Natural Language Processing (NLP);
in fact, while recent years witnessed an increase of
theoretical linguistic works on various aspects of co-
ordination, it seems that NLP lags behind in address-
ing this phenomenon head on. One of the exceptions
is (Dale and Mazur, 2007), which deals with the
problem of identifying the number of Named En-
tities (NEs) in expressions of the form “X and Y”,
where X and Y are sequences of capitalised words,
e.g.: “Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority” (sin-
gle entity) or “American Express and Visa Interna-
tional” (two entities). (Dale and Mazur, 2007) note
that the problem is statistically non-negligible, as
around 5.7% of sequences of capitalised words with
an optional conjunction (i.e., candidates for NEs)
actually contain a conjunction. Similarly, (Rus et
al., 2007, p. 229) discuss the bracketing problem in
phrases such as “[soccer and tennis] player” and
“navy and [marine corps]”, noting that “[p]arsing
base Noun Phrases ... is not handled by current state-
of-the-art syntactic parsers”. Another kind of coor-
dination ambiguity is considered in (Steiner, 2006),
namely, the “NP and NP” sequence as either an
NP-coordination, or a part of sentential coordination
(where the first NP is an object of the preceding verb
and the second NP is the subject of the following
verb).
Slavonic rich inflection makes the processing of
such potentially coordinate structures easier. For ex-
ample, case disagreement between two apparently
coordinated NPs is a strong clue that they in fact
belong to separate coordinated clauses, while agree-
ment is a (perhaps weaker) clue that they form an ac-

<bodyText confidence="0.99984625">
tually coordinated NP.12 Similarly, (dis)agreement
in case, number and gender may help decide whether
two apparently coordinated adjectival forms actually
form a coordinate structure.

4 Slavonic is Processable
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99878">
After discussing ways in which Slavonic languages
seem to be hard or easy for Information Extraction,
let us look at practical attempts at Slavonic IE, espe-
cially those involving partial parsing.
It seems that there have been relatively few at-
tempts at applying shallow (or partial; cf. fn. 2)
grammars to particular practical tasks. In some
of these attempts no particular dedicated language
processing system was used to implement shallow
grammars: apparently they were coded directly in
the host programming language.
One example is (Sharoff, 2004), where shallow
parsing is used for the identification of preposi-
tional Multi Word Expressions in Russian, with
the following explanation of reasons for performing
some language-dependent processing: “Given that
the word order in Russian (and other Slavonic lan-
guages) is relatively free and a typical word (i.e.
lemma) has many forms (typically from 9 for nouns
to 50 for verbs), the sequences of exact N-grams are
much less frequent than in English, thus rendering
purely statistical approaches useless.”
For Polish, simple shallow grammars were im-
plemented for the tasks of question answering
(Piechoci´nski and Mykowiecka, 2005) and auto-
matic valence acquisition (Fast and Przepiórkowski,
2005; Przepiórkowski and Fast, 2005); in the lat-
ter case a grammar was implemented as a cas-
cade of Perl regular expressions. Similarly, (Zeman,
2001) describes a Perl regular expression implemen-
tation of a shallow preprocessor for a deep statistical
parser. Much earlier, (Nenadi´c and Vitas, 1998; Ne-
nadi´c, 2000) developed shallow grammars of Serbo-
Croatian for the recognition of noun phrases (NPs)
and certain kinds of coordinate structures. See also
(Bekavac and Tadi´c, 2007) on the recognition of
Croatian NEs with regular grammars.
Moreover, for Bulgarian a more general integrated
system was developed, called LINGUA (Tanev and
Mitkov, 2002), which — apart from modules for
12Again, this test may fail due to case syncretisms; cf. §2.4.
tokenisation, morphosyntactic analysis and disam-
biguation, and anaphora resolution — includes an
NP extractor and a bottom-up grammar of Bul-
garian. This system, together with a set of shal-
low patterns for identifying definition patterns, has
been employed in a Question Answering prototype
system (Tanev, 2004). Bulgarian pattern-matching
grammars are also employed in (Koeva, 2007).
Apart from these language-specific implementa-
tions, there exist tools and toolboxes which facilitate
various IE tasks, including shallow parsing. Proba-
bly the best known such a general system is GATE
(Cunningham et al., 1995; Cunningham et al., 2002),
which contains some NE resources for Bulgarian
and Russian (Humphreys et al., 2002; Popov et al.,
2004) and allows to write shallow (regular) gram-
mars in the JAPE subsystem (Cunningham et al.,
2000).
A system similar in scope is SProUT (Becker et
al., 2002), whose shallow parsing language allows
to write regular grammars over HPSG-style (Pol-
lard and Sag, 1994) typed feature structures and
which includes the operation of unification. Prelim-
inary work on adapting SProUT to the processing
of Baltic and Slavonic languages is presented in
(Dro˙zd˙zy´nski et al., 2003), with much subsequent
work devoted to the processing of Polish, especially,
in the area of Information Extraction from medical
texts (Piskorski et al., 2004; Piskorski, 2004a; Pisko-
rski, 2004b; Marciniak et al., 2005; Mykowiecka et
al., 2005a; Mykowiecka et al., 2005b; Marciniak and
Mykowiecka, 2007).
Although GATE and SProUT may be adapted to
the processing of XML documents, they are perhaps
not the most natural choice for the further processing
of morphosyntactically annotated documents in, for
example, the XCES (XML Corpus Encoding Stan-
dard; (Ide et al., 2000)) format, as assumed, e.g.,
in the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish (Przepiórkowski,
2004a), in the Slovak National Corpus (Garabík
and Gianitsová-Ološtiaková, 2005), or in the LT4eL
project (http://www.lt4el.eu/). Specialised
XML-aware tools exist for such tasks.
One of the earliest collections of XML process-
ing tools is the LT XML library (Brew et al., 2000),
whose second edition, LT-XML2 is currently under
preparation. One of the tools in that new edition,
lxtransduce (Tobin, 2005), is an efficient pro-

gram to add mark-up to XML files via regular gram-
mars over XML elements; this tool is currently used
for implementing definition-extraction grammars
for Bulgarian, Czech and Polish (Przepiórkowski et
al., 2007).
A system well-known in Slavonic NLP is CLaRK
(Simov et al., 2001; Simov et al., 2002); it imple-
ments various XML mechanism and proposes a lan-
guage for developing shallow grammars over XML
documents; such grammars have been implemented
for Bulgarian, as reported in (Simov et al., 2004;
Simov and Osenova, 2004).
Finally, a new system, SPADE (Shallow Parsing
and Disambiguation Engine), abbreviated to “4”
(Unicode character 0x2660), has recently been de-
veloped at the Institute of Computer Science, Pol-
ish Academy of Sciences (Przepiórkowski, 2007b;
Buczy´nski, 2007). This tool, unlike many other
shallow parsing tools,13 accepts a possibly mor-
phosyntactically ambiguous (XCES-encoded) input
and performs simultaneous morphosyntactic disam-
biguation and shallow parsing. For example, the rule
below, called P + co/kto, will match a possible
preposition followed by a possible form of one of
the pronouns CO ‘what’ or KTO ‘who’,14 it will try
to unify the selected case of the preposition with
the case of the pronoun and, if that succeeds, it will
mark any non-unified interpretations as rejected and
it will mark the two words as a prepositional group
with the preposition (cf. 1 below) as its syntactic
head and the pronoun (cf. 2) as its semantic head.15
Moreover, any non-prepositional interpretations of
the first segment of the match and any non-nominal
interpretations of the second segment will be marked
as incorrect. The language for specification of seg-
ments is based on the query syntax of the Poliqarp
corpus search engine (Przepiórkowski et al., 2004;

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991533333333">
While the relatively free word order of Slavonic lan-
guages makes the processing of Slavonic unambigu-
ously harder, I claim that the effects of the rich nom-
inal inflection are mixed: rich inflection dramatically
increases the complexity of low-level IE tasks such
as NER, but it is beneficial for high-level IE tasks
which involve filling scenario templates, as it facil-
itates identifying grammatical roles, parsing coordi-
nation, etc. Moreover, as becomes clear on the basis
of the overview of practical work on Slavonic IE in
the last decade, recent years have witnessed substan-
tially increased interest and activity in the area. I am
convinced that the Balto-Slavonic Natural Language
Processing workshop at ACL 2007 will further catal-
yse the development of this field.

<abstract confidence="0.9978206875">Information Extraction (IE) often involves some amount of partial syntactic processing. This is clear in cases of interesting highlevel IE tasks, such as finding information about who did what to whom (when, where, how and why), but it is also true in case of simpler IE tasks, such as finding company names in texts. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of Slavonic phenomena which pose particular problems for IE and partial parsing, and some phenomena which seem easier to treat in Slavonic than in Germanic or Romance; I also mention various tools which have been used for the partial processing of Slavonic.</abstract>

Specialised XML-aware tools exist for such tasks. One of the earliest collections of XML processing tools is the LT XML library (Brew et al., 2000), whose second edition, LT-XML2 is currently under preparation. One of the tools in that new edition, lxtransduce (Tobin, 2005), is an efficient pro5 gram to add mark-up to XML files via regular grammars over XML elements; this tool is currently used for implementing definition-extraction grammars for Bulgarian, Czech and Polish (Przepiórkowski et al., 2007). A system well-known in Slavonic NLP is CLaRK (Simov et al., 2001; Simov et al., 2002); it implements various XML mechanism and proposes a language for developing shallow grammars over XML documents; such grammars have been implemented for</context>

So, for example, in the rather artificial sentence Samochody dwie minuty wyprzedzaja˛ autobusy ‘(The) cars (for) two minutes are overtaking (the) buses’, each of samochody, dwie minuty and autobusy may be interpreted as either nominative or accusative, i.e., as the subject (nominative), the object (accusative) or a temporal adjunct (accusative). 2.5 Numeral Phrases An area of Slavonic syntax very well-known in theoretical linguistics is the syntactic behaviour of NumPs (Corbett, 1978; Franks, 1995); numerals also turn out to be awkward for automatic processing in various ways.6 First, the case of the noun (phrase) within an NumP depends on the numeral7 and on the position of the whole NumP in the sentence. For example, for NumPs in the subject position, the noun is in the nominative case, roughly, if the numeral is or ends in 2, 3 or 4 (with the exception of 12, 13 and 14), and it is genitive otherwise.8 This means that the shallow processor should recognise as a possible currency quantity the sequence 152 dolary and 155 dolarów, but not *152 dolarów or *155 dolary.9 Seco</context>

One phenomenon important for high level IE where the rich inflectional system plays a positive role, however, is coordination. Coordination is infamous both in theoretical linguistics and in Natural Language Processing (NLP); in fact, while recent years witnessed an increase of theoretical linguistic works on various aspects of coordination, it seems that NLP lags behind in addressing this phenomenon head on. One of the exceptions is (Dale and Mazur, 2007), which deals with the problem of identifying the number of Named Entities (NEs) in expressions of the form “X and Y”, where X and Y are sequences of capitalised words, e.g.: “Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority” (single entity) or “American Express and Visa International” (two entities). (Dale and Mazur, 2007) note that the problem is statistically non-negligible, as around 5.7% of sequences of capitalised words with an optional conjunction (i.e., candidates for NEs) actually contain a conjunction. Similarly, (Rus et al., 2007, p. 229) discuss the bracketing problem in phrases such as “[soc</context>

Similarly, (Zeman, 2001) describes a Perl regular expression implementation of a shallow preprocessor for a deep statistical parser. Much earlier, (Nenadi´c and Vitas, 1998; Nenadi´c, 2000) developed shallow grammars of SerboCroatian for the recognition of noun phrases (NPs) and certain kinds of coordinate structures. See also (Bekavac and Tadi´c, 2007) on the recognition of Croatian NEs with regular grammars. Moreover, for Bulgarian a more general integrated system was deve</context>

While for many European languages a dictionary of lemmata of proper names is sufficient for the task of NER, (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007, §3.3) note that “a minimum of morphological treatment” is required for languages with rich nominal inflection, such as Balto-Slavonic or Finno-Ugric languages. Unfortunately, for the majority of Slavonic languages, there are no (freely) publicly available resources that could provide such “minimum morphological treatment” of proper names.

This system, together with a set of shallow patterns for identifying definition patterns, has been employed in a Question Answering prototype system (Tanev, 2004). Bulgarian pattern-matching grammars are also employed in (Koeva, 2007). Apart from these language-specific implementations, there exist tools and toolboxes which facilitate various IE tasks, including shallow parsing. Probably the best known such a general system is GATE (Cunningham et al., 1995; Cunningham et al., 2002), which contains some NE resources for Bulgarian and Russian (Humphreys et al., 2002; Popov et al., 2004) and allows to write shallow (regular) grammars in the JAPE subsystem (Cunningham et al., 2000).

For example, given that a Polish nominal form may have one of 2 numbers, one of 7 cases and one of 5 genders,5 there are 70 possible nominal tags, not counting gerundial and pronominal forms. In fact, there are 4179 possible tags in the IPI PAN Tagset of Polish (Przepiórkowski and Woli´nski, 2003a; Przepiórkowski and Woli´nski, 2003b), of which around 1150 occur in nature (Przepiórkowski, 2006b). Similarly, sizes of Czech tagsets range from 1171 (Hajiˇc and Hladká, 1997), through 1631 (Pala et al., 1998), to theoretically 4257, but “only” about 1100 actually used (Mirovský et al., 2002). Such detailed tagsets make it difficult to reach high accuracy, which — on the assumption that syntactic parsing is preceded by full morphosyntactic disambiguation — has negative influence on syntactic processing. Another problem connected to the rich inflection system of Slavonic languages is the large number of syncretisms. For example, a typical Polish adjective may have 11 textually different forms (e.g., for BIAŁY ‘white’: biali, biała, biał ˛a, białe, białego, białej, białemu, biały, białych, białym, bi</context>

This is a problem in itself in recognising proper names, but it is further exacerbated by the fact that such proper nouns may have different gender values, and different inflectional paradigms, than the corresponding common nouns. For example, while the common nouns GRZYB and GOŁ ˛AB are, respectively, inanimate masculine and animate masculine (cf. fn. 5), the correspondi</context>

For example, the only large free (but not open source) morphological analyser for Polish, Morfeusz (Woli´nski, 2006), contains very few proper names.3 Moreover, the NE content of commercial analysers is often rather low, so that simple resource-light heuristics sometimes give better results (Urba´nska and Mykowiecka, 2005, p. 214). Such heuristics usually involve the creation of inflected forms by adding typical suffixes (Popov et al., 2004; Urba´nska and Mykowiecka, 2005; Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007), where the suffix addition/substitution rules are either handgenerated (Urba´nska and Mykowiecka, 2005) or automatically acquired (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007). 3A new version of Morfeusz, containing a large dictionary of proper names, is being prepared, but it is currently not clear if it is going to be freely available for non-commercial research purposes (M.

One of the exceptions is (Dale and Mazur, 2007), which deals with the problem of identifying the number of Named Entities (NEs) in expressions of the form “X and Y”, where X and Y are sequences of capitalised words, e.g.: “Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority” (single entity) or “American Express and Visa International” (two entities). (Dale and Mazur, 2007) note that the problem is statistically non-negligible, as around 5.7% of sequences of capitalised words with an optional conjunction (i.e., candidates for NEs) actually contain a conjunction. Similarly, (Rus et al., 2007, p. 229) discuss the bracketing problem in phrases such as “[soccer and tennis] player” and “navy and [marine corps]”, noting that “[p]arsing base Noun Phrases ... is not handled by current stateof-the-art syntactic parsers”. Another kind of coordination ambiguity is considered in (Steiner, 2006), namely, the “NP and NP” sequence as either an NP-coordination, or a part of sentential coordination (where the first NP is an object of the preceding verb and the second NP is the subject of the following verb).

For example, in plu5Traditionally, 3 genders were assumed for Polish, as for many other European languages, but (Ma´nczak, 1956) conclusively shows that at least 5 gender values must be adopted in Polish: virile (called also m1, personal masculine and human masculine), animate masculine (m2), inanimate masculine (m3), neuter and feminine. Although this repertoire of genders was only recently adopted in general dictionaries (Ba´nko, 2000), it is still rather conservative; e.g., (Saloni, 1976) proposes 9 genders. ral, Polish non-virile (non-human-masculine) nouns have the same form in the nominative and in the accusative, while in the singular, inanimate masculine and neuter forms do. Similarly, virile and animate masculine nouns have the same singular accusative and singular genitive forms. So, for example, in the rather artificial sentence Samochody dwie minuty wyprzedzaja˛ autobusy ‘(The) cars (for) two minutes are overtaking (the) buses’, each of samochody, dwie minuty and autobusy may be interpreted as either nominative or accusative, i.e., as the subject (nominative), the obj</context>

It seems that there have been relatively few attempts at applying shallow (or partial; cf. fn. 2) grammars to particular practical tasks. In some of these attempts no particular dedicated language processing system was used to implement shallow grammars: apparently they were coded directly in the host programming language. One example is (Sharoff, 2004), where shallow parsing is used for the identification of prepositional Multi Word Expressions in Russian, with the following explanation of reasons for performing some language-dependent processing: “Given that the word order in Russian (and other Slavonic languages) is relatively free and a typical word (i.e. lemma) has many forms (typically from 9 for nouns to 50 for verbs), the sequences of exact N-grams are much less frequent than in English, thus rendering purely statistical approaches useless.” For Polish, simple shallow grammars were implemented for the tasks of question answering (Pie</context>

While for many European languages a dictionary of lemmata of proper names is sufficient for the task of NER, (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007, §3.3) note that “a minimum of morphological treatment” is required for languages with rich nominal inflection, such as Balto-Slavonic or Finno-Ugric languages. Unfortunately, for the majority of Slavonic languages, there are no (freely) publicly available resources that could provide such “minimum morphological treatment” of proper names. For example, the only large free (but not open source) morphological analyser for Polish, Morfeusz (Woli´nski, 2006), contains very few proper names.3 Moreover, the NE content of commercial analysers is often rather low, so that simple resource-light heuris</context>

(Dale and Mazur, 2007) note that the problem is statistically non-negligible, as around 5.7% of sequences of capitalised words with an optional conjunction (i.e., candidates for NEs) actually contain a conjunction. Similarly, (Rus et al., 2007, p. 229) discuss the bracketing problem in phrases such as “[soccer and tennis] player” and “navy and [marine corps]”, noting that “[p]arsing base Noun Phrases ... is not handled by current stateof-the-art syntactic parsers”. Another kind of coordination ambiguity is considered in (Steiner, 2006), namely, the “NP and NP” sequence as either an NP-coordination, or a part of sentential coordination (where the first NP is an object of the preceding verb and the second NP is the subject of the following verb). Slavonic rich inflection makes the processing of such potentially coordinate structures easier. For example, case disagreement between two apparently coordinated NPs is a strong clue that they in fact belong to separate coordinated clauses, while agreement is a (perhaps weaker) clue that they form an ac4 tually coordinated NP.12 Similarly, (dis)agreement in case, number and gender ma</context>
