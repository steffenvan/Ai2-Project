Abstract

Progress in human language technology
requires increasing amounts of data and
annotation in a growing variety of lan-
guages. Research in Named Entity ex-
traction is no exception. Linguistic Data
Consortium is creating annotated corpora
to support information extraction in Eng-
lish, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages
for a variety of US Government-
sponsored programs. This paper covers
the scope of annotation and research tasks
within these programs, describes some of
the challenges of multilingual corpus de-
velopment for entity extraction, and con-
cludes with a description of the corpora
developed to support this research.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999917734042553">
Ongoing research in human language technol-
ogy (HLT) requires vast amounts of data for sys-
tem training and development, plus stable
benchmark data to measure ongoing progress. Re-
searchers require greater and greater volumes of
data, representing a broadening inventory of hu-
man languages and ever more sophisticated
annotation. This presents a substantial challenge to
the HLT community because human annotation
and corpus creation is quite costly. New
approaches to research require not tens but
hundreds and thousands of hours of speech data,
and millions of words of text. The availability of
high quality language resources remains a central
issue for the many communities involved in basic
research, technology development and education
technology development and education related to
language. The role of international data centers
continues to evolve to accommodate emerging
needs in the speech and language technology
community (Liberman and Cieri 2002).
The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) was
founded in 1992 at the University of Pennsylvania,
with seed money from DARPA, specifically to
address the need for shared language resources.
Since then, LDC has created and published more
than 241 linguistic databases and has accumulated
considerable experience and skill in managing
large-scale, multilingual data collection and anno-
tation projects. LDC has established itself as a
center for research into standards and best prac-
tices in linguistic resource development, while par-
ticipating actively in ongoing HLT research.
LDC has had a major role in creating annotated
corpora and other resources to support named en-
tity extraction, as well as larger information extrac-
tion activities, for a number of years. Current
work in this area falls under a handful of research
programs. The DARPA Program in Translingual
Information Detection, Extraction, and Summari-
zation (TIDES 2002) combines technologies in
detection, extraction, summarization and transla-
tion to create systems capable of searching a wide
range of streaming multilingual text and speech
sources, in real time, to provide effective access for
English-speaking users. TIDES core languages are
English, Mandarin and Arabic; second tier lan-
guages are Korean, Spanish, and Japanese. The
primary medium is text though this includes
speech recognition output. The TIDES research
tasks require broadcast transcripts and news texts
to be annotated for entities, relations, and events;
categorized by topic; translated; summarized; and
processed in a variety of other ways.
Another of the TIDES Program goals is to pro-
duce technology that can be easily ported to handle
new natural languages. To this end, the TIDES
Surprise Language Exercise (LDC 2003b) chal-
lenges researchers to produce working systems for
a previously untargeted language within a con-
strained time span (for instance, a single calendar
month).
Currently operating under the TIDES umbrella,
the Automatic Content Extraction program (NIST
2002) builds on the successes of previous extrac-
tion research programs. The objective of the ACE
Program is to develop extraction technology to
support automatic processing of source language
data (in the form of natural text, and as text derived
from Optical Character Recognition and Automatic
Speech Recognition output). This includes classi-
fication, filtering, and selection based on the lan-
guage content of the source data, i.e., the meaning
conveyed by the data. Thus the ACE program re-
quires the development of technologies that auto-
matically detect and characterize this meaning.
The ACE research objectives are viewed as the
detection and characterization of Entities, Rela-
tions, and Events. LDC provides data and annota-
tions to support these program goals.
Another DARPA program, Evidence Extraction
and Link Detection (EELD 2002), draws on lin-
guistic resources created by LDC to promote its
research goals. The EELD program aims for de-
velopment of technologies and tools for automated
discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evi-
dence contained in large amounts of classified and
unclassified data sources. EELD is developing
detection capabilities to extract relevant data and
relationships about people, organizations, and ac-
tivities from message traffic and open source data.
LDC has provided domain-specific entity-tagged
corpora in support of the EELD technology evalua-
tion.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900076923077">
While LDC&apos;s current resource development ef-
forts support ACE and related programs in particu-
lar, ACE is hardly the first program to tackle
named entities and the larger information extrac-
tion problem. The Message Understanding Con-
ference Program (MUC) (NIST 1999a) focused on
named entity extraction, coreference relations
among noun phrases, the identification of selected
relations, and events. High system performance
within the English newswire domain motivated an
expansion of the named entity task after MUC-7.
In 1999, the DARPA Hub-4 NE Project (Chinchor
et. al. 1999) expanded the domain of source data to
include broadcast news transcripts.
LDC joined the group of those developing cor-
pora to support named entity research in that same
year, providing annotations for the TIDES Infor-
mation Extraction-Entity Recognition (IE-ER) task
(NIST 1999b). In the following year, LDC began
to develop corpora and other resources to support
the ACE program.
ACE is substantially similar in scope to these
earlier extraction programs, though slightly differ-
ent in focus. ACE adds new varieties of annotated
data to the information extraction domain.
Annotators tag newswire, broadcast news
transcripts and newspaper data. Additionally, re-
search sites are evaluated on their performance on
degraded ASR and OCR output. Under the TIDES
umbrella, the ACE program supports the multilin-
gual resource and system development, focusing
currently on Chinese and Arabic.
ACE also modifies the inventory of entity types
targeted by the MUC tasks (Chinchor et. al. 1997).
While MUC considered three entity types (person,
organization, location), ACE further divides loca-
tions into geo-political entities and facilities, while
the newest phase also adds weapons, substances,
and vehicles (similar to the MUC artifact cate-
gory). Coreference is preserved in ACE, while
generic entities and metonymy are tackled explic-
itly.
ACE brings together many of the separate tasks
evaluated under different components of the MUC
program. All ACE tasks -- entities, relations and
events -- evaluate not only recognition but also
characterization of these phenomena. While the
MUC Template Relation and Scenario Template
tasks targeted relations and events plus their attrib-
utes, the focus of these tasks was domain specific.
ACE tasks, on the other hand, are defined to be
more general and domain-independent.

<bodyText confidence="0.999690666666667">
Named entity annotation is a core component of
ACE, but the scope of the annotation required by
the program builds substantially on this.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999257">
3.1 The Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605836956522">
There are three main ACE tasks: Entity Detec-
tion and Tracking, Relation Detection and Charac-
terization, and Event Detection and
Characterization.
Entity Detection and Tracking is the most fun-
damental of the ACE tasks and was the sole focus
of the ACE Pilot effort as well as ACE Phase One.
The entity task provides a foundation for the re-
maining annotation and research tasks. ACE anno-
tators identify five types of entities (Mitchell et. al.
2002). The first two types, Person and Organiza-
tion, remain substantially similar to their defini-
tions under MUC. Locations within ACE are
limited to geographical entities such as land-
masses, bodies of water, and geological forma-
tions. Two new entity types are tagged under
ACE: Facilities, which include buildings and other
permanent man-made structures and real estate
improvements; and GPEs, which are geographical
regions defined by political and/or social groups.
GPEs are composite in nature, typically having a
government, a populace, and a geographic loca-
tion, as well as some more abstract notion of state-
hood.
A GPE subsumes and does not distinguish be-
tween a nation, its region, its government and its
people. However, annotators also assign a role to
each textual reference (mention) of a GPE, indicat-
ing which of these aspects is most prominent for
that mention. In the example below, the two entity
mentions refer to the governmental (rather than
people or location) aspect of the entities, so in both
cases the mentions would be tagged as GPEs with
Organization roles:
{Russia} recently held discussions with {the US}
regarding the ongoing crisis.
ACE annotators tag all mentions of each entity
within a document, whether named, nominal or
pronominal. For every mention, the annotator
identifies the maximal extent of the string that
represents the entity. Nested mentions are also
captured. Each entity is classified according to its
type, and co-reference among mentions is re-
corded. While the ACE Pilot Annotation effort did
not explicitly deal with metonymic entities and
generics, Phase One of ACE added these elements
to the entity annotation and research tasks.
Metonymy occurs when a single string of text
makes reference to multiple entities. Generally,
these distinct entities are related to each other in
some way. For example, in this sentence,
{Beijing} will not continue sales of anti-ship mis-
siles to {Iran}.
Beijing, though literally referring to the name of
the capital of China, is being used as a reference to
the government of China. The relationship be-
tween &amp;quot;Beijing the city&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Beijing the seat of
China&apos;s government&amp;quot; triggers this metonymic ref-
erence. When metonymic references occur, ACE
annotators create two separate entities, one for
each reference.
An entity is generic when it does not refer to a
particular object or set of objects in the world.
Generic entities include references to general types
of objects, hypothetical objects and generalizations
across sets of objects. Annotators apply the rules
of mention coreference to generic entities, and spe-
cifically classify each entity as specific or generic.
In future ACE efforts the set of targeted entities
will expand to include vehicles, weapons, and sub-
stances. Entity subtypes will also be added.
The second phase of the ACE program added
relation detection and characterization to the suite
of annotation and research tasks. This task targets
five relation types (Mitchell et. al. 2002b): Role,
Part, Located, Near, and Social. For example,
Role relations link people to organizations and
GPEs in employment, affiliate, and citizenship
relationships. The Social relation links people in
personal, familial or professional relationships.
Each relation type is further classified according to
its subtype. For instance, the Role relation in-
cludes Management, General Staff, Member,
Owner, Founder, and Citizen-Of subtypes.
For every relation, annotators identify two pri-
mary arguments (namely, the two ACE entities that
are linked) as well as the relation&apos;s temporal attrib-
utes (Sundheim 2001). Temporal information is
drawn from pre-existing TIMEX2 1 annotation
(Ferro et. al. 2001) wherever those values are ex-
plicitly linked to a relation. LDC annotators also
create more general, relative time attributes de-

rived from the tense of the verb that heads the
predication of the relation. Relations that are sup-
ported by explicit textual evidence are distin-
guished from those that depend on contextual
inference on the part of the reader.
The following is an example of an explicit rela-
tion of type Located:
{President Bush} was in {New York} Thurs-
day.
The textual evidence supports the relation between
the entities President Bush and New York, with the
temporal attributes was and Thursday.
Future phases of ACE will refine the relation
task to highlight new relations that are of particular
interest to the program, and to allow finer categori-
zation of some existing types.
ACE Phase Three adds a new challenge: recog-
nition and characterization of events. Definition of
a set of general event types and subtypes is cur-
rently underway. Targeted types include Interac-
tion, Movement, Transfer, Creation and
Destruction events. Annotators label event argu-
ments (agent, patient and the like) and attributes
(temporal, locative) according to a type-specific
template. They further tag the textual mention or
anchor for each event and categorize it by type and
subtype. For example, the sentence below contains
reference to an Interaction event.
{Colin Powell} and {Jiang Zemin} held high-level
talks in {Beijing} last week.
Annotators extract the specific text reference to the
event (held high-level talks); identify the meeting
participants (Colin Powell, Jiang Zemin) as argu-
ments of the event; tag the locative (Beijing) and
temporal (held, last week) attributes.
The event task will expand in future phases of
ACE to include additional event types and sub-
types, as well characterization of relations between
events.

3.2 The Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999162962963">
The large amounts of data, multilingual focus
and the number and range of annotation tasks re-
quired by the ACE program lends itself to a team-
based approach to annotation. A single project
manager provides oversight for all LDC ACE ac-
tivities. Language-specific lead annotators work
directly with teams of part-time (typically student)
annotators, providing training, monitoring progress
and generally supervising the annotation staff. The
project manager works with lead annotators to de-
velop and maintain the formal ACE annotation
task definitions and guidelines (LDC 2003a).
The complexity of ACE annotation requires an-
notators with a solid background in linguistics,
particularly syntax and semantics. New annotators
first become familiar with the basic concepts and
terminology and study the annotation guidelines
before annotating several sets of training files.
Throughout the training process, supervisors pro-
vide periodic feedback, comparing the trainee’s
annotation to a gold standard, identifying discrep-
ancies and refining the annotator’s approach to the
data and understanding of guidelines and rules.
Not until an annotator has achieved a certain level
of accuracy and speed is he permitted to tag actual
data.
The annotation work environment is designed
to encourage regular discussion and &amp;quot;groupthink&amp;quot;
among the annotation team. Problems and ques-
tions are logged for future reference, and teams
meet regularly to discuss outstanding issues. A
web-based annotation manual contributes to the
team approach. This reference complements the
formal task definition, documenting decisions
about how to handle problematic constructions and
outlier examples. Because its content is developed
solely by ACE annotators, the web guidelines also
function as a training tool. New annotators regu-
larly add to the guidelines, focusing on the aspects
of the ACE tasks that are most difficult for them.
During production annotation, separate annota-
tors conduct at minimum two complete passes over
the data. First pass annotation creates the initial
markup, and a second pass reviews the existing
annotation for consistency and accuracy. Second
passing is typically conducted by more experi-
enced senior annotators. A targeted third pass is
performed to further enhance annotation quality.
During the third pass, lead annotators review the
annotated data to catch common errors and ensure
consistent treatment of difficult constructions.
In addition to multiple passes over all ACE
data, an additional 5% to 10% of the data is com-
pletely re-annotated from scratch by separate anno-
tators. Results of this dual annotation are compared
and discrepancies adjudicated in order to establish
inter-annotator agreement scores and identify areas
of lingering confusion or inconsistency. While
rates of inter-annotator agreement for ACE named
entities are comparable to MUC consistency levels,
the results for the more complex annotation tasks
are considerably lower. Particular challenges in-
clude the coreference of generic entities and the
use of metonymy, GPE roles, and implicit vs. ex-
plicit relations.
The first two phases of ACE annotation utilized
MITRE&apos;s Alembic Workbench (Day 1997), which
was customized for the ACE tasks. With the ex-
pansion into new languages and the addition of
events, LDC began development of a locally de-
signed, locally supported ACE toolkit. Utilizing
the Annotation Graphs model (Bird and Liberman
2001), the toolkit provides for customized, plat-
form-independent, multilingual ACE annotation.
At present the toolkit supports entity tagging only;
focused relation and event tagging modules are
under development. The toolkit will also support
customized functions for second passing, compari-
son and adjudication of dually-annotated files, and
additional quality control features including que-
ries of the annotation database.

3.3 Multilingual ACE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988244289256199">
In its first two phases the ACE program has fo-
cused primarily on English language data. Under
TIDES, the program has grown to include new lan-
guages. LDC is supporting this expansion with
production annotation in Arabic and Chinese, as
well as exploratory work in Farsi.
LDC has completed development of entity an-
notation guidelines in Chinese and Arabic. Full-
scale Chinese annotation is well underway, while
Arabic annotation is just beginning. To move from
the basic English tasks into Chinese, Arabic and
Farsi, LDC draws on the expertise of fluent bilin-
gual linguists and language scholars. These ex-
perts first fully learn the English annotation tasks
and complete some training annotation in English.
They then apply the English guidelines to texts in
the target language, keeping careful note of any
constructions that motivate changes or additions to
the guidelines. After several rounds of test annota-
tion in the target language, new guidelines are
crafted in English, but with examples drawn exclu-
sively from the target language2. The new guide-
2 This means that annotators for non-English ACE tasks must
be fluent bilinguals. Customarily, new annotators start by
lines are then extensively tested with pilot annota-
tion by multiple annotators in the target language.
Further modifications to the guidelines are made as
new patterns in the data are observed.
Each time a new language is targeted, lan-
guage-specific challenges emerge. For Chinese,
one of the most difficult problems is the lack of
agreed-upon rules for word segmentation. While
English is written with white space around each
new word, &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is not a fundamental concept in
Chinese, and characters are written without white
space. Because entity annotation requires annota-
tors to select both the maximal extent of a mention
as well as the mention&apos;s head, it becomes difficult
for annotators to agree on the exact series of char-
acters that constitute the head of a mention. Anno-
tation guidelines for Chinese must include rules for
dealing with this issue.
Chinese also presents difficulties for tagging
generic entities. The rules for identifying generics
in English rely in part on tests surrounding the ex-
istence of determiners. However, determiners do
not exist in Chinese, and this required the creation
of new annotation guidelines for generics that rely
solely on context. Similarly, Arabic often uses
determiners in a way that is different from English.
For instance, in Arabic it is common to use a con-
struction with a determiner when referring to a
class of entities:
The horse is a wonderful animal.
rather than a bare plural, more common in English:
Horses are wonderful animals.
The complexity of Arabic morphology presents a
very different set of problems. Unlike Chinese and
English, Arabic commonly uses pronoun affixes.
For ACE, this means that any annotation tool must
allow partial words to be tagged as mentions of
entities in Arabic, while disallowing this for other
languages.
In addition to these linguistic differences, some
distinctive stylistic qualities of Chinese and Arabic
news reporting present challenges for annotators
and are worthy of note.
learning the English ACE tasks then move into their language-
specific annotation. This supports a consistent approach to
annotation across the multiple languages despite the necessary
language-specific modifications.
Many of these challenges are based in cultural
differences. For example, many industries in
China are government owned and operated. Con-
sequently, names of organizations are often quite
different than their English counterparts, and
guidelines written with English naming conven-
tions in mind are inadequate for handling common
Chinese name constructions like &amp;quot;Beijing School
Number 4&amp;quot;.
Further, organizations located outside of China
are often referred to with their country’s name pre-
ceding the company name. This presents a chal-
lenge for annotator consistency, since it is often
unclear whether to include the country as part of
the extent of the company name.
Arabic news sources regularly use very long
sentences with multiple clauses. This presents the
annotator with different kinds of mention extent
and coreference decisions than found in English
news data. Mention extents are typically longer
and contain more nested mentions, and pronominal
references to entities are more easily confused.
Another set of problems extends beyond any
language-specific considerations; these have to do
with the infrastructure needed to support a large-
scale multilingual data creation effort. Finding
qualified native speaker annotators with adequate
training in linguistics and eligibility to work in the
United States is a serious challenge. Further, ex-
panding ACE into new languages is not simply a
matter of addressing the linguistic questions, but
also tackling the technical ones. Maintaining data
formats and annotation tools that can accommodate
not only multiple annotation tasks, but also multi-
ple languages and multiple character sets and en-
codings presents a significant problem.
Despite the range of issues described above,
porting the ACE annotation task into new lan-
guages is relatively straightforward. The funda-
mental work of moving into a new language for
ACE involves identifying the syntactic and mor-
phological (i.e., surface) constructions that are
used to refer to the entities, relations and events of
interest. This is not an insubstantial task, and re-
quires both the insights of trained linguists and
many rounds of pilot annotation and exploration of
the data. However, the fundamental concepts tar-
geted by ACE, and the underlying semantic con-
tent discussed in the annotated texts, remain
substantially similar from one language to the next.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999075">
As part of the ACE program, and to further
support both the DARPA TIDES and DARPA
EELD Programs, LDC has developed a number of
annotated corpora. These corpora all draw on
broadcast news, newspaper and newswire data.
Sources include data from the Topic Detection and
Tracking corpora, Chinese Treebank, Arabic Tree-
bank and other news materials.
Corpus development for the ACE program be-
gan in 1999. Initially, the Pilot Phase was de-
signed to develop a basic task definition for entity
detection and tracking. Multiple research sites in-
cluding MITRE, BBN, NYU, and LDC annotated
the same set of 15,000 words of English data to
establish a shared understanding of the annotation
guidelines and resolve any inter-annotator discrep-
ancies. This data supported technology evalua-
tions in May and November 2000.
In ACE Phase 1, the research and annotation
tasks were expanded to address metonymy and
generic entities. Multiple research sites joined
LDC in annotating 180,000 words of training data
to support a February 2002 evaluation. LDC was
solely responsible for annotating an additional
45,000 words of evaluation data.
ACE Phase 2 required research sites to addi-
tionally detect and characterize relations between
entities. During this phase of ACE, LDC acted as
sole annotation site and also took on responsibility
for developing and maintaining annotation guide-
lines. Phase 2 used the entire ACE Phase 1 corpus
as training data, and added an additional 45,000
words of new evaluation data. Both training and
evaluation data were annotated for entities plus
relations. In support of the EELD Program, LDC
annotators tagged another 30,000 words of do-
main-specific training data plus 20,000 words of
test data for entities and relations. A September
2002 evaluation tested system performance for
both Entities and Relations.
LDC is currently producing English test data to
augment the existing corpora in support of a Fall
2003 TIDES extraction evaluation; in addition,
LDC is creating data and annotations for multilin-
gual extraction research in Chinese and Arabic.
100,000 words of Chinese Treebank and 10,000
words of Arabic Treebank have already been anno-
tated for entities.
Alongside corpus development, LDC is work-
ing in parallel to expand and refine the existing set
of ACE tasks. These modifications are being made
with input from both the TIDES Extraction and
ACE communities. For ACE Phase 3, LDC will
annotate 300,000 words of data in each of three
languages: English, Chinese and Arabic; pilot an-
notation in Farsi is also targeted. Ultimately, all
three annotation tasks -- entities, relations and
events -- will be represented in the data. The cor-
pora developed by LDC to support ACE, EELD,
and TIDES Extraction are currently available to
program participants only (LDC 2003c). General
publication of the ACE Pilot and ACE Phase 1
Corpora is slated for Summer 2003; upon publica-
tion, the data will be available to LDC members as
well as non-members. The remaining ACE and
related corpora will be published after the conclu-
sion of these programs&apos; evaluation cycles.
Outside of the ACE program, LDC has devel-
oped a handful of additional resources for multi-
lingual extraction research. As part of the TIDES
Surprise Language Exercise, LDC collects and
creates linguistic resources in a previously untar-
geted language in an extremely compressed time
span. During a two-week dry run in March 2003,
the target was Cebuano, a language of the Philip-
pines. Within the span of a few days, LDC created
250,000 words of monolingual text, built a 20,000
word lexicon, created 25,000 words of parallel
text, built a morphological parser, and completed
named entity tagging of 32,000 words of text.
Given the severe time constraints of the exer-
cise, named entity annotators used a trimmed-
down version of the MUC Named Entity Guide-
lines rather than the more complex full MUC or
ACE guidelines. Despite the time constraints, in-
ter-annotator consistency remained high when
LDC-tagged data was compared with data tagged
by annotators at BBN. A similar set of resources
for a new surprise language will be developed dur-
ing the Surprise Language evaluation in June 2003.
All of the data developed for Surprise Language is
currently available to TIDES participants, and will
be released as a general publication at the conclu-
sion of the Exercise.
A final resource created to support named enti-
ties within information extraction more broadly is
the Xinhua Chinese-English Named Entity list,
created from Xinhua Newswire&apos;s proper name and
who&apos;s who databases. This corpus contains nearly
one million proper names of various kinds, includ-
ing approximately 500,000 person names, 300,000
place names, 30,000 organization names, and tens
of thousands of other name types. The data pro-
vides both Chinese to English and English to Chi-
nese name pairs. This corpus, slated for
publication in Summer 2003, is currently available
to TIDES participants.
Much of the material described above is based
upon large volumes of text and speech best col-
lected from commercial providers. Commercial
sources may require the negotiation of agreements
that permit the distribution of data to researchers
while constraining the use of the material to lin-
guistic education, research, and technology devel-
opment. LDC coordinates all necessary intellectual
property arrangements for data developed under
multiple research programs including TIDES,
ACE, and EELD to make resources gathered in
this way available to the broader research commu-
nities.
Sponsored common task research programs like
TIDES and ACE rely heavily upon such shared
resources. LDC was in fact created specifically to
facilitate research sharing. In order to allow for
expedited delivery of data to a group of researchers
participating in a common task evaluation, LDC
has developed a new data distribution method
known as ECorpora. ECorpora target expedited
delivery of training and devtest data to support of
formal evaluations. Upon the conclusion of the
formal task evaluation, pending negotiations with
research sponsors and program coordinators, LDC
publishes data more broadly to permit access to
these valuable resources to all communities work-
ing in linguistic education, research, and technol-
ogy development.

<abstract confidence="0.983742294117647">Progress in human language technology requires increasing amounts of data and annotation in a growing variety of languages. Research in Named Entity extraction is no exception. Linguistic Data Consortium is creating annotated corpora to support information extraction in English, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages for a variety of US Governmentsponsored programs. This paper covers the scope of annotation and research tasks within these programs, describes some of the challenges of multilingual corpus development for entity extraction, and concludes with a description of the corpora developed to support this research.</abstract>

The ACE research objectives are viewed as the detection and characterization of Entities, Relations, and Events. LDC provides data and annotations to support these program goals. Another DARPA program, Evidence Extraction and Link Detection (EELD 2002), draws on linguistic resources created by LDC to promote its research goals. The EELD program aims for development of technologies and tools for automated discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources. EELD is developing detection capabilities to extract relevant data and relationships about people, organizations, and activities from message traffic and open source data.

New approaches to research require not tens but hundreds and thousands of hours of speech data, and millions of words of text. The availability of high quality language resources remains a central issue for the many communities involved in basic research, technology development and education technology development and education related to language. The role of international data centers continues to evolve to accommodate emerging needs in the speech and language technology community (Liberman and Cieri 2002). The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) was founded in 1992 at the University of Pennsylvania, with seed money from DARPA, specifically to address the need for shared language resources. Since then, LDC has created and published more than 241 linguistic databases and has accumulated considerable experience and skill in managing large-scale, multilingual data collection and annotation projects.

LDC has provided domain-specific entity-tagged corpora in support of the EELD technology evaluation. 2 From MUC to ACE While LDC&apos;s current resource development efforts support ACE and related programs in particular, ACE is hardly the first program to tackle named entities and the larger information extraction problem. The Message Understanding Conference Program (MUC) (NIST 1999a) focused on named entity extraction, coreference relations among noun phrases, the identification of selected relations, and events. High system performance within the English newswire domain motivated an expansion of the named entity task after MUC-7. In 1999, the DARPA Hub-4 NE Project (Chinchor et. al. 1999) expanded the domain of source data to include broadcast news transcripts. LDC joined the group of those developing corpora to support named entity research in that same year, providing annotations for the TIDES Information Extraction-Entity Recognition (IE-ER) task (NIST 1999b).

Another of the TIDES Program goals is to produce technology that can be easily ported to handle new natural languages. To this end, the TIDES Surprise Language Exercise (LDC 2003b) challenges researchers to produce working systems for a previously untargeted language within a constrained time span (for instance, a single calendar month). Currently operating under the TIDES umbrella, the Automatic Content Extraction program (NIST 2002) builds on the successes of previous extraction research programs. The objective of the ACE Program is to develop extraction technology to support automatic processing of source language data (in the form of natural text, and as text derived from Optical Character Recognition and Automatic Speech Recognition output). This includes classification, filtering, and selection based on the language content of the source data, i.e., the meaning conveyed by the data. Thus the ACE program requires the development of technologies that automatically detect and characterize this meaning. The ACE research </context>

The Social relation links people in personal, familial or professional relationships. Each relation type is further classified according to its subtype. For instance, the Role relation includes Management, General Staff, Member, Owner, Founder, and Citizen-Of subtypes. For every relation, annotators identify two primary arguments (namely, the two ACE entities that are linked) as well as the relation&apos;s temporal attributes (Sundheim 2001).
