Binarization is essential for achieving
polynomial time complexities in pars-
ing and syntax-based machine transla-
tion. This paper presents a new binariza-
tion scheme, target-side binarization, and
compares it with source-side and syn-
chronous binarizations on both string-
based and tree-based systems using syn-
chronous grammars. In particular, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of target-
side binarization on a large-scale tree-to-

Several recent syntax-based models for machine
translation (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006) can
be seen as instances of the general framework of
synchronous grammars and tree transducers. In this
framework, decoding can be thought of as pars-
ing problems, whose complexity is in general expo-
nential in the number of nonterminals on the right
hand side of a grammar rule. To alleviate this prob-
lem, one can borrow from parsing the technique
of binarizing context-free grammars (into Chomsky
Normal Form) to reduce the complexity. With syn-
chronous context-free grammars (SCFG), however,
this problem becomes more complicated with the
additional dimension of target-side permutation.
The simplest method of binarizing an SCFG is
to binarize (left-to-right) on the source-side as if
treating it as a monolingual CFG for the source-
langauge. However, this approach does not guaran-

tee contiguous spans on the target-side, due to the ar-
bitrary re-ordering of nonterminals between the two
languages. As a result, decoding with an integrated
language model still has an exponential complexity.
Synchronous binarization (Zhang et al., 2006)
solves this problem by simultaneously binarizing
both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule,
making sure of contiguous spans on both sides
whenever possible. Neglecting the small amount
of non-binarizable rules, the decoding complexity
with an integrated language model becomes polyno-
mial and translation quality is significantly improved
thanks to the better search. However, this method is
more sophisticated to implement than the previous
method and binarizability ratio decreases on freer
word-order languages (Wellington et al., 2006).
This paper presents a third alternative, target-
side binarization, which is the symmetric version of
the simple source-side variant mentioned above. We
compare it with the other two schemes in two pop-
ular instantiations of MT systems based on SCFGs:
the string-based systems (Chiang, 2005; Galley et
al., 2006) where the input is a string to be parsed
using the source-side of the SCFG; and the tree-
based systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006)
where the input is a parse tree and is recursively
converted into a target string using the SCFG as a
tree-transducer. While synchronous binarization is
the best strategy for string-based systems, we show
that target-side binarization can achieve the same
performance of synchronous binarization for tree-
based systems, with much simpler implementation
and 100% binarizability.

schemes through a motivational example.
A synchronous CFG (SCFG) is a context-free
rewriting system for generating string pairs. Each
rule (synchronous production) rewrites a nontermi-
nal in two dimensions subject to the constraint that
the sequence of nonterminal children on one side is
a permutation of the nonterminal sequence on the
other side. Each co-indexed child nonterminal pair
will be further rewritten as a unit. The rank of a rule
is defined as the number of its synchronous nonter-
minals. We also define the source and target projec-
tions of an SCFG to be the CFGs for the source and
target languages, respectively.
For example, the following SCFG1

Chinese (source) and English (target). The source-
projection of the first rule, for example, is

<bodyText confidence="0.99940575">
Decoding with an SCFG (e.g., translating from
Chinese to English using the above grammar) can be
cast as a parsing problem (see Section 3 for details),
in which case we need to binarize a synchronous rule
with more than two nonterminals to achieve polyno-
mial time algorithms (Zhang et al., 2006). We will
next present the three different binarization schemes

The first and simplest scheme, source-side binariza-

the SCFG without respecting the re-orderings on the
target-side. So it will binarize the first rule as:

which corresponds to Figure 1 (b). Notice that the
virtual nonterminal NP-PP representing the inter-
mediate symbol is discontinuous with two spans on
the target (English) side, because this binarization
scheme completely ignores the reorderings of non-
terminals. As a result, the binarized grammar, with
a gap on the target-side, is no longer an SCFG, but
can be represented in the more general formalism of
Multi-Text Grammars (MTG) (Melamed, 2003):

here [1, 2,1] denotes that on that target-side, the first
nonterminal NP-PP has two discontinuous spans,
with the second nonterminal VP in the gap.
Intuitively speaking, the gaps on the target-side
will lead to exponential complexity in decoding with
integrated language models (see Section 3), as well
as synchronous parsing (Zhang et al., 2006).

The example rule is now binarized into:
which corresponds to Figure 1 (c). This represen-
tation, being contiguous on both sides, successfully
reduces the decoding complexity to a low polyno-
mial and significantly improved the search quality
(Zhang et al., 2006).
However, this scheme has the following draw-
backs. First, synchronous binarization is not always
possible with an arbitrary SCFG. Some reorder-
ings, for example, the permutation (2, 4, 1, 3), is
non-binarizable. Although according to Zhang et al.
(2006), the vast majority (99.7%) of rules in their
Chinese-English dataset are binarizable, there do ex-
ist some interesting cases that are not (see Figure 2
for a real-data example). More importantly, the ra-
tio of binarizability, as expected, decreases on freer
word-order languages (Wellington et al., 2006). Sec-
ond, synchronous binarization is significantly more
complicated to implement than the straightforward
source-side binarization.

We now introduce a novel scheme, target-side bi-

<bodyText confidence="0.99984055">
Although the discontinuity on the source-side in
this new scheme causes exponential complexity in
string-based systems (Section 3.1), the continuous
spans on the target-side will ensure polynomial com-
plexity in tree-based systems (Section 3.2).
Before we move on to study the effects of vari-
ous binarization schemes in decoding, we need some
formal machineries of discontinuities.
We define the source and target arities of a
virtual nonterminal V , denoted s(V ) and t(V ), to
be the number of (consecutive) spans of V on the
source and target sides, respectively. This definition
extends to a binarization b of an SCFG rule of rank
n, where arities s(b) and t(b) are defined as the
maximum source and target arities over all virtual
nonterminals in b, respectively. For example, the
source and target arities of the three binarizations in
Figure 1 are 1 and 2 for (b), 1 and 1 for (c), and
2 and 1 for (d). In general, the arities for the three
binarization schemes are summarized in Table 1.

We now compare the algorithmic complexities of the
three binarization schemes in a central problem of
machine translation: decoding with an integrated n-
gram language model. Depending on the input be-
ing a string or a parse-tree, we divide MT systems
based on synchronous grammars into two broad cat-
egories: string-based and tree-based.

3.1 String-based Approaches

<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
String-based approaches include both string-to-
string (Chiang, 2005) and string-to-tree systems
(Galley et al., 2006).2 To simplify the presentation
we will just focus on the former but the analysis also
applies to the latter. We will first discuss decoding
with a pure SCFG as the translation model (hence-
forth −LM decoding), and then extend it to include
an n-gram model (+LM decoding).

3.1.1 Translation as Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857090909091">
The −LM decoder can be cast as a (monolin-
gual) parser on the source language: it takes the
source-language string as input and parses it using
the source-projection of the SCFG while building
the corresponding target-language sub-translations
in parallel. For source-side and synchronous bina-
rizations, since the resulting grammar has contigu-
ous source spans, we can apply the CKY algorithm
which guarantees cubic time complexity.
For example, a deduction along the virtual rule in
the synchronously binarized grammar (4) is notated

<equation confidence="0.9989265">

where i, j, k are free indices in the source string,
w1, w2 are the scores of the two antecedent items,
and t1, t2 are the corresponding sub-translations.3
The resulting translation t2t1 is the inverted concate-
nation as specified by the target-side of the SCFG
rule.
The case for a source-side binarized grammar (3)
is slightly more complicated than the above, because
we have to keep track of gaps on the target side. For
example, we first combine NP with PP

2Our notation off-to-Ysystems is defined as follows: X de-
notes the input, either a string or a tree; while Y represents the
RHS structure of an individual rule: Y is string if the RHS is
a flat one-level tree (as in SCFGs), and Y is tree if the RHS
is multi-level as in (Galley et al., 2006). This convention also
applies to tree-based approaches.

since they can be recovered from backpointers and they are not
considered part of the state. We keep them here only for presen-
tation reasons.

In both cases, there are still only three free indices
on the source-side, so the complexity remains cubic.
The gaps on the target-side do not require any ex-
tra computation in the current −LM setting, but as
we shall see shortly below, will lead to exponential
complexity when integrating a language model.
For a target-side binarized grammar as in (5),
however, the source-side spans are discontinuous
where CKY can not apply, and we have to enumerate
more free indices on the source side. For example,
the first deduction

Both of the above deductions have four free in-

More generally, the complexity of a binarization
scheme depends on its source arity. In the worst-
case, a binarized grammar with a source arity of s
will require at most (2s + 1) free indices in a deduc-
tion, because otherwise if one rule needs (2s + 2)

indices, then there are s+1 spans, which contradicts
the definition of arity (Huang et al., 2005).4
These deductive systems represent the search
space of decoding without a language model. When
one is instantiated for a particular input string, it de-
fines a set of derivations, called a forest, represented
in a compact structure that has a structure of a hyper-
graph. Accordingly we call items like (PP1,3) nodes
in the forest, and an instantiated deduction like

resentation, the time complexity of −LM decoding,
which we refer to as source-side complexity, is pro-
portional to the size of the forest F, i.e., the num-
ber of hyperedges (instantiated deductions) in F. To

3.1.2 Adding a Language Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991291875">
To integrate with a bigram language model, we
can use the dynamic-programming algorithm of Wu
(1996), which we may think of as proceeding in
two passes. The first pass is as above, and the sec-
ond pass traverses the first-pass forest, assigning to
each node v a set of augmented items, which we call
+LM items, of the form (va⋆b), where a and b are
target words and ⋆ is a placeholder symbol for an
elided part of a target-language string. This item in-
dicates that a possible translation of the part of the
input spanned by v is a target string that starts with
a and ends with b.
Here is an example deduction in the syn-
chronously binarized grammar (4), for a +LM item
for the node (PP-VP1,6) based on the −LM Deduc-
tion (6):

4Actually this is true only if in any binarization scheme,
a non-contiguous item is always combined with a contiguous
item. We define both source and target binarizations to be in-
cremental (i.e., left-to-right or right-to-left), so this assumption
trivially holds. More general binarization schemes are possible
to have even higher complexities, but also possible to achieve
better complexities. Full discussion is left for a separate paper.
where w′ = w1 + w2 − log Plm(with  |talk) is
the score of the resulting +LM item: the sum of
the scores of the antecedent items, plus a combi-
nation cost which is the negative log probability of
the bigrams formed in combining adjacent boundary
words of antecedents.
Now that we keep track of target-side boundary
words, an additional complexity, called target-side
complexity, is introduced. In Deduction (11), four
target words are enumerated, and each +LM item
stores two boundary words; this is also true in gen-
eral for synchronous and target-side binarized gram-
mars where we always combine two consecutive
target strings in a deduction. More generally, this
scheme can be easily extended to work with an m-
gram model (Chiang, 2007) where m is usually &gt; 3
(trigram or higher) in practice. The target-side com-
plexity for this case is thus
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.838557">
O(|V |4(m−1))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999001411764706">
where V is the target language vocabulary. This is
because each constituent must store its initial and
final (m − 1)-grams, which yields four (m − 1)-
grams in a binary combination. In practice, it is often
assumed that there are only a constant number of
translations for each input word, which reduces this
complexity into O(|w|4(m−1)).
However, for source-side binarization which
leaves gaps on the target-side, the situation becomes
more complicated. Consider Deduction (8), where
the sub-translation for the virtual node NP-PP is
gapped (t1Ut2). Now if we integrate a bigram model
based on that deduction, we have to maintain the
boundary words of both t1 and t2 in the +LM node
of NP-PP. Together with the boundary words in node
VP, there are a total of six target words to enumerate
for this +LM deduction:

We now conclude that, in a string-based system,
the combined complexities for a binarized grammar
with source arity s and target arity t is

The results for the three specific binarization
schemes are summarized in Table 2. Although both
source-side and target-side binarizations lead to ex-
ponential complexities, it is likely that language
model combinations (target-side complexity) dom-
inate the computation, since m is larger than 2 in
practice. In this sense, target-side binarization is still
preferable to source-side binarization.
It is also worth noting that with the hook trick
of Huang et al. (2005), the target-side complex-
ity can be reduced to O(|w|(2t+1)(m−1)), making
it more analogous to its source-side counterpart:
if we consider the decoding problem as intersect-
ing the SCFG with a source-side DFA which has
|S |= |w|+1 states, and a target-side DFA which has
|T  |= O(|w|m−1) states, then the intersected gram-
mar has a parsing complexity of O(|S|2s+1|T|2t+1),
which is symmetric from both sides.

3.2 Tree-based Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931">
The tree-based approaches include the tree-to-string
(also called syntax-directed) systems (Liu et al.,
2006; Huang et al., 2006). This approach takes
a source-language parse tree, instead of the plain
string, as input, and tries to find the best derivation
that recursively rewrites the input tree into a target

where η and η · i(i = 1, 2, 3) are tree addresses
(Shieber et al., 1995), with η · i being the ith child
of η (the address of the root node is ǫ). The nonter-
minal labels at these tree nodes must match those in
the SCFG rule, e.g., the input tree must have a PP at
node η · 2.
The semantics of this deduction is the following:
if the label of the current node in the input tree is
S, and its three children are labeled NP, PP, and VP,
with corresponding sub-translations t1, t2, and t3,
then a possible translation for the current node S is
t1t3t2 (see Figure 4). An alternative, top-down ver-
sion of this bottom-up deductive system is, at each
node, try all SCFG rules that pattern-match the cur-
rent subtree, and recursively solve sub-problems in-
dicated by the variables, i.e., synchronous nontermi-
nals, of the matching rule (Huang et al., 2006).
With the input tree completely given, this setting
has some fundamental differences from its string-
based counterpart. First, we do not need to bina-
rize the SCFG grammar before −LM decoding. In
fact, it will be much harder to do the tree-parsing
(pattern-matching) with a binarized grammar. Sec-
ond, regardless of the number of nonterminals in a
rule, building the −LM forest always costs time lin-
ear in the size of the input tree (times a grammar
constant, see (Huang et al., 2006, Sec. 5.1) for de-
tails), which is in turn linear in the length of the input
string. So we have:

<bodyText confidence="0.9998414">
string, using the SCFG as a tree-transducer. In this
setting, the −LM decoding phase is a tree-parsing
problem (Eisner, 2003) which aims to cover the en-
tire tree by a set of rules. For example, a deduction
of the first rule in Example 1 would be:

This fast −LM decoding is a major advantage of
tree-based approaches.
Now in +LM decoding, we still need binariza-
tion of the hyperedges, as opposed to rules, in the
forest, but the analysis is almost identical to that of
string-based approach. For example, the tree-based
version of Deduction (12) for source-side binariza-

Table 2 shows that in this tree-based setting,
target-side binarization has exactly the same perfor-
mance with synchronous binarization while being
much simpler to implement and does not have the
problem of non-binarizability. The fact that simple
binarization works (at least) equally well, which is
not possible in string-based systems, is another ad-
vantage of the tree-based approaches.

Section 3 shows that target-side binarization
achieves the same polynomial decoding complexity
as the more sophisticated synchronous binarization
in the tree-based systems. We now empirically com-
pare target-side binarization with an even simpler
variant, on-the-fly generation, where the only dif-
ference is that the latter does target-side left-to-right
binarization during +LM decoding on a hyperedge-
per-hyperedge basis, without sharing common vir-
tual nonterminals across hyperedges, while the for-
mer binarizes the whole −LM forest before the
+LM decoding.
Our experiments are on English-to-Chinese trans-

language string according to transfer rules in a syn-
chronous grammar (Galley et al., 2006). For in-

nese. Although the rules are actually in a syn-
chronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) instead
of an SCFG, its derivation structure is still a hy-
pergraph and all the analysis in Section 3.2 still
applies. This system performs slightly better than
the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh
(Koehn, 2004) on English to Chinese translation. A
very similar system for the reverse direction is de-
scribed in (Liu et al., 2006).
Our data preparation follows (Huang et al., 2006):
the training data is a parallel corpus of 28.3M words
on the English side, from which we extracted 24.7M
tree-to-string rules using the algorithm of (Galley et
al., 2006), and trained a Chinese trigram model on
the Chinese side. We test our methods on the same
test-set as in (Huang et al., 2006) which is a 140 sen-
tence subset of NIST 2003 MT evaluation with 9–36
words on the English side. The weights for the log-
linear model is tuned on a separate development set.

This paper presents a new binarization scheme, target-side binarization, and compares it with source-side and synchronous binarizations on both stringbased and tree-based systems using synchronous grammars. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of targetside binarization on a large-scale tree-tostring translation system. 1 Introduction Several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers. In this framework, decoding can be thought of as parsing problems, whose complexity is in general exponential in the number of nonterminals on the right hand side of a grammar rule. To alleviate this problem, one can borrow from parsing the technique of binarizing context-free grammars (into Chomsky Normal Form) to reduce the complexity. With synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), however, this problem becomes more complicated with the additional dimension of target-side permutation. The simples</context>

However, this method is more sophisticated to implement than the previous method and binarizability ratio decreases on freer word-order languages (Wellington et al., 2006). This paper presents a third alternative, targetside binarization, which is the symmetric version of the simple source-side variant mentioned above. We compare it with the other two schemes in two popular instantiations of MT systems based on SCFGs: the string-based systems (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006) where the input is a string to be parsed using the source-side of the SCFG; and the treebased systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) where the input is a parse tree and is recursively converted into a target string using the SCFG as a tree-transducer. While synchronous binarization is the best strategy for string-based systems, we show that target-side binarization can achieve the same performance of synchronous binarization for treebased systems, with much simpler implementation and 100% binarizability. 2 Synchronous Grammars and Binarization Schemes In this section, we define synchr</context>

We will first discuss decoding with a pure SCFG as the translation model (henceforth −LM decoding), and then extend it to include an n-gram model (+LM decoding). 3.1.1 Translation as Parsing The −LM decoder can be cast as a (monolingual) parser on the source language: it takes the source-language string as input and parses it using the source-projection of the SCFG while building the corresponding target-language sub-translations in parallel.

The case for a source-side binarized grammar (3) is slightly more complicated than the above, because we have to keep track of gaps on the target side. For example, we first combine NP with PP (NPi,j) : (w1, t1) (PPj,k) : (w2, t2) (NP-PPi,k) : (w1 + w2, t1 U t2) (7) 2Our notation off-to-Ysystems is defined as follows: X denotes the input, either a string or a tree; while Y represents the RHS structure of an individual rule: Y is string if the RHS is a flat one-level tree (as in SCFGs), and Y is tree if the RHS is multi-level as in (Galley et al., 2006). This convention also applies to tree-based approaches. 3The actual system does not need to store the translations since they can be recovered from backpointers and they are not considered part of the state.

Our experiments are on English-to-Chinese translation in the tree-to-string system of Huang et al. (2006), which takes a source-language parse tree as input and tries to recursively convert it to a targetlanguage string according to transfer rules in a synchronous grammar (Galley et al., 2006).

More generally, the complexity of a binarization scheme depends on its source arity. In the worstcase, a binarized grammar with a source arity of s will require at most (2s + 1) free indices in a deduction, because otherwise if one rule needs (2s + 2) PP NP-VP i k l three Chinese indices English translations t1 t3 t2 t1 t2 NP-VP NP-PP VP NP-PP 36 indices, then there are s+1 spans, which contradicts the definition of arity (Huang et al., 2005).4 These deductive systems represent the search space of decoding without a language model. When one is instantiated for a particular input string, it defines a set of derivations, called a forest, represented in a compact structure that has a structure of a hypergraph. Accordingly we call items like (PP1,3) nodes in the forest, and an instantiated deduction like (PP-VP1,6) — (PP1,3)(VP3,6) we call a hyperedge that connects one or more antecedent nodes to a consequent node.

Although both source-side and target-side binarizations lead to exponential complexities, it is likely that language model combinations (target-side complexity) dominate the computation, since m is larger than 2 in practice. In this sense, target-side binarization is still preferable to source-side binarization. It is also worth noting that with the hook trick of Huang et al.

This approach takes a source-language parse tree, instead of the plain string, as input, and tries to find the best derivation that recursively rewrites the input tree into a target (Sη) : (w1 + w2 + w3, t1t3t2) (13) where η and η · i(i = 1, 2, 3) are tree addresses (Shieber et al., 1995), with η · i being the ith child of η (the address of the root node is ǫ). The nonterminal labels at these tree nodes must match those in the SCFG rule, e.g., the input tree must have a PP at node η · 2. The semantics of this deduction is the following: if the label of the current node in the input tree is S</context>

With the input tree completely given, this setting has some fundamental differences from its stringbased counterpart. First, we do not need to binarize the SCFG grammar before −LM decoding. In fact, it will be much harder to do the tree-parsing (pattern-matching) with a binarized grammar. Second, regardless of the number of nonterminals in a rule, building the −LM forest always costs time linear in the size of the input tree (times a grammar constant, see (Huang et al., 2006, Sec. 5.1) for details), which is in turn linear in the length of the input string. So we have: O(|F|) = O(|w|). string, using the SCFG as a tree-transducer. In this setting, the −LM decoding phase is a tree-parsing problem (Eisner, 2003) which aims to cover the entire tree by a set of rules. For example, a deduction of the first rule in Example 1 would be: (NPη·1) : (w1, t1) (PPη·2) : (w2, t2) (VPη·3) : (w3, t3) 38 This fast −LM decoding is a major advantage of tree-based approaches. Now in +LM decoding, we still need binarization of the hyperedges, as opposed to rules, in the forest, but th</context>

We now empirically compare target-side binarization with an even simpler variant, on-the-fly generation, where the only difference is that the latter does target-side left-to-right binarization during +LM decoding on a hyperedgeper-hyperedge basis, without sharing common virtual nonterminals across hyperedges, while the former binarizes the whole −LM forest before the +LM decoding. Our experiments are on English-to-Chinese translation in the tree-to-string system of Huang et al. (2006), which takes a source-language parse tree as input and tries to recursively convert it to a targetlanguage string according to transfer rules in a synchronous grammar (Galley et al., 2006). For instance, the following rule VP-C x1:VBN PP IN x2:NP-C by translates an English passive construction into Chinese. Although the rules are actually in a synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) instead of an SCFG, its derivation structure is still a hypergraph and all the analysis in Section 3.2 still applies.

This paper presents a third alternative, targetside binarization, which is the symmetric version of the simple source-side variant mentioned above. We compare it with the other two schemes in two popular instantiations of MT systems based on SCFGs: the string-based systems (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006) where the input is a string to be parsed using the source-side of the SCFG; and the treebased systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) where the input is a parse tree and is recursively converted into a target string using the SCFG as a tree-transducer. While synchronous binarization is the best strategy for string-based systems, we show that target-side binarization can achieve the same performance of synchronous binarization for treebased systems, with much simpler implementation and 100% binarizability. 2 Synchronous Grammars and Binarization Schemes In this section, we define synchronous contextfree grammars and present the three binarization 33 Proceedings of SSST, NAACL-HLT 2007 / AMTA Workshop on </context>

Notice that the virtual nonterminal NP-PP representing the intermediate symbol is discontinuous with two spans on the target (English) side, because this binarization scheme completely ignores the reorderings of nonterminals.

The resulting grammar is thus another SCFG, the binary branching equivalent of the original grammar, which can be thought of as an extension of the S → NP 1 PP 2 VP 3 , NP 1 VP 3 PP 2 34 [jinyibu]1 [jiu zhongdong weiji ]2 [juxing]3 [huitan]4 further on Mideast crisis hold talk ‘[hold]3 [further]1 [talks]4 [on the Mideast crisis]2’ English −→ 1 2 3 4 Chinese — Fi</context>

Chomsky Normal Form in synchronous grammars. The example rule is now binarized into: which corresponds to Figure 1 (c). This representation, being contiguous on both sides, successfully reduces the decoding complexity to a low polynomial and significantly improved the search quality (Zhang et al., 2006). However, this scheme has the following drawbacks. First, synchronous binarization is not always possible with an arbitrary SCFG. Some reorderings, for example, the permutation (2, 4, 1, 3), is non-binarizable. Although according to Zhang et al. (2006), the vast majority (99.7%) of rules in their Chinese-English dataset are binarizable, there do exist some interesting cases that are not (see Figure 2 for a real-data example). More importantly, the ratio of binarizability, as expected, decreases on freer word-order languages (Wellington et al., 2006). Second, synchronous binarization is significantly more complicated to implement than the straightforward source-side binarization. 2.3 Target-side Binarization We now introduce a novel scheme, target-side binarization, which is the symmetric version of the source-side variant.
