This paper presents an algorithm for finding
systematic polysemous classes in WordNet
and similar semantic databases, based on a
definition in (Apresjan 1973). The
introduction of systematic polysemous
classes can reduce the amount of lexical
semantic processing, because the number of
disambiguation decisions can be restricted
more clearly to those cases that involve real
ambiguity (homonymy). In many
applications, for instance in document
categorization, information retrieval, and
information extraction, it may be sufficient
to know if a given word belongs to a certain
class (underspecified sense) rather than to
know which of its (related) senses exactly to
pick. The approach for finding systematic
polysemous classes is based on that of
(Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), while
addressing some previous shortcomings.

This paper presents an algorithm for finding
systematic polysemous classes in WordNet
(Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp
and Feldweg 1997) -- a semantic database
for German similar to WordNet. The
introduction of such classes can reduce the
amount of lexical semantic processing,
because the number of disambiguation
decisions can be restricted more clearly to
those cases that involve real ambiguity
(homonymy). Different than with
homonyms, systematically polysemous
words need not always be disambiguated,
because such words have several related
senses that are shared in a systematic way by
a group of similar words. In many
applications then, for instance in document
categorization and other areas of
information retrieval, it may be sufficient to
know if a given word belongs to this group
rather than to know which of its (related)
senses exactly to pick. In other words, it will
suffice to assign a more coarse grained sense
that leaves several related senses
underspecified, but which can be further
specified on demandl.
The approach for finding systematic
polysemous classes is based on that of
(Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), but
takes into account some shortcomings as
pointed out in (ICrymolowski and Roth
1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998)
(Tomuro 1998). Whereas the original
approach identified a small set of top-level
synsets for grouping together lexical items,
I As pointed out in (Wilks 99), earlier work in Al on
Polaroid Words&apos; (Hirst 87) and &apos;Word Experts&apos;
(Small 81) advocated a similar, incremental approach
to sense representation and interpretation. In line with
this, the CoreLex approach discussed here provides a
large scale inventory of systematically polysemous
lexical items with underspecified representations that
can be incrementally refined.

the new approach compares lexical items
according to all of their synsets on all
hierarchy levels. In addition, the new
approach is both more flexible and precise
by using a clustering algorithm for
comparing meaning distributions between
lexical items. Whereas the original approach
took into account only identical distributions
(with additional human intervention to
further group together sufficiently similar
classes), the clustering approach allows for
completely automatic comparisons, relative
to certain thresholds, that identify partial
overlaps in meaning distributions.

Systematic Polysemous Classes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999640944444444">
In lexical semantics, a distinction can be
made between senses that are of a
contrastive and those that are of a
complementary nature (Weinreich 1964).
Contrastive senses are unrelated to each
other as with the two meanings of &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot;.
However, such clear-cut (contrastive)
meaning distinctions are rather the exception
than the rule. Often, words have a number of
(complementary) senses that are somehow
related to each other in systematic ways
(Pustejovsky 1995). For instance, a word
like &amp;quot;mouth&amp;quot; has several senses that are all
somehow related (after Cruse 1986):
John opened his mouth.
This parasite attaches itself to their mouths.
The mouth of the cave resembles a bottle.
The mouth of the river starts here.
</bodyText>

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99852225">
Related senses are, however, only
systematic (or regular) if more than one
example in a language can be found as
formulated in (Apresjan 1973):
Polysemy of the word A with the meanings ai
and ai is called regular if in the given
language, there exists at least one other
word B with the meanings bi k, which are
semantically distinguished from each other
in exactly the same way as ai and aj and if ai
and bi, ai and b1 are nonsynonymous.
With this definition, we can construct
classes of systematically polysemous words
as shown in the CoreLex approach
(Buitelaar 1998a) (Buitelaar 1998b). This
method takes WordNet sense assignments
and compares their distribution by reducing
them to a set of basic types. For instance,
WordNet assigns to the noun &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; the
following senses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999526875">
1. publication
2. product, production
3. fact
4. dramatic_composition,
drarnatic_work
5. record
6. section, subdivision
7. journal
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999619954545455">
At the top of the WordNet hierarchy these
seven senses can be reduced to two basic
types: the content that is being
communicated and the medium of
communication. We can arrive at
systematically polysemous classes by
investigating which other words share these
same senses and are thus polysemous in the
same way. For instance, the seven different
senses that WordNet assigns to &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; can
be reduced to two basic types: artifact and
communication. We do this for each noun
and then group them into classes according
to their combination of basic types.
by human introspection several classes were
grouped together, because their members
seemed sufficiently similar.
Among the resulting classes are a number that
are to be expected given the literature on
systematic polysemy. For instance, the classes
animal 1 food and plant / natural product have
been discussed widely. Other classes are less

expected, but seem quite intuitive. The class
artifact / attribute / substance for instance
includes a number of nouns (&amp;quot;chalk, charcoal,
daub, fiber, fibre, tincture&amp;quot;) that refer to an
object that is at the same time an artifact made
of some substance and that is also an attribute.

3.1 A More Flexible Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999818184210526">
The CoreLex database has been used and/or
evaluated in a number of projects, leading to
some criticisms of the approach in
(Krymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters,
Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998) and
in personal communication. Primarily it was
argued that the choice of basic types is
arbitrary and on too high a level. Systematic
class discovery in the original approach is
dependent on this set of basic types, which
means that classes on lower levels are not
captured at all. Further criticism arose on the
arbitrariness (and inefficiency) of human
intervention in grouping together resulting
classes into more comprehensive ones based
on the similarity of their members.
In response to this, a new approach was
formulated and implemented that addresses
both these points. Comparison of sense
distributions is now performed over synsets
on all levels, not just over a small set on the
top levels. In addition, similarity on sense
distribution between words need no longer
be complete (100%), as with the former
approach. Instead, a threshold on similarity
can be set that constraints a clustering
algorithm for automatically grouping
together words into systematic polysemous
classes. (No human intervention to further
group together resulting classes is required.)
This approach took inspiration from the
pioneering work by (Dolan 1994), but it is
also fundamentally different, because
instead of grouping similar senses together,
the CoreLex approach groups together
words according to all of their senses.
Thereby following Apresjan&apos;s definition of
systematic polysemy discussed above.

3.2 The Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9971465">
The algorithm works as follows (for
example for nouns):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989393">
1. foreach noun
2. get all level, synsets (senses)
3. if number of level&apos; synsets &gt; 1
then put noun in list
4. foreach leveli synset
5. get all higher level synsets (hypemyms)
6. foreach noun&apos; in list
7. foreach noun2 in list
8. compute similarity noun&apos; and noun2

then put noun, and noun2 in matrix

<bodyText confidence="0.97291195">
13. if noun2 not assigned to a cluster
then assign noun2 to new cluster C,
For every noun in the WordNet or
GermaNet index, get all of its senses (which
are in fact leveli synsets). If a noun has more
than one sense put it in a separate list that
will be used for further processing. Nouns
with only one sense are not used in further
processing because we are only interested in
systematic distributions of more than one
sense over several nouns. In order to
compare nouns not only on the sense level
but rather over the whole of the WordNet
hierarchy, also all higher level synsets
(hypernyms) for each sense are stored.
Then, for each noun we compare its &amp;quot;sense
distribution&amp;quot; (the complete set of synsets
derived in the previous steps) with each
other noun. Similarity is computed using the
Jaccard score, which compares objects

<bodyText confidence="0.9988415">
according to the attributes they share and
their unique attributes. If the similarity is
over a certain threshold, the noun pair is
stored in a matrix which is consequently
used in a final clustering step.
Finally, the clustering itself is a simple,
single link algorithm that groups together
objects uniquely in discrete clusters.

3.3 Quantitative and Qualitative
Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.9997634">
Depending on the threshold on similarity,
the algorithm generates a number of clusters
of ambiguous words that share similar sense
distributions, and which can be seen as
systematic polysemous classes. In the
following table an overview is given of
results with different thresholds. The
number of nouns in WordNet that were
processed is 46.995, of which 10.772 have
more than one sense.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892714285714">
Systematic polysemous classes that are
obtained in this way can be used as filters on
sense disambiguation in a variety of
applications in which a coarse grained sense
assignment will suffice in many cases, but
where an option of further specification
exists. For instance, in information retrieval
</bodyText>

it will not always be necessary to distinguish
between the two interpretations of &amp;quot;baseball,
basketball, football, ...&amp;quot;2.Users looking for
information on a baseball-game may be
interested also in baseball-balls. On the
other hand, a user may be interested
specifically in buying a new baseball-ball
and does not wish to be flooded with
irrelevant information on baseball-games. In
this case, the underspecified ball / game
sense needs to be further specified in the ball
sense only. Similarly, it will not always be
necessary to distinguish exactly between the
vessel interpretation of &amp;quot;bottle, bucket, cask,
...&amp;quot; and the measure interpretation, or
between the communication interpretation of
a &amp;quot;clamor, hiss, roar, ...&amp;quot; and the noise
interpretation.
Currently, a query expansion module based
on the approach described here is under
development as part of the prototype
systems of two EU funded projects:
MIETTA3 (a cross-lingual search engine in
the tourism domain — Buitelaar et al 1998)
and OLIVE4 (a cross-lingual video retrieval
system).
Also in shallow processing applications like
semantic pre-processing for document
categorization it will be sufficient to use an
underspecified sense instead of needless
disambiguation between senses that are
roughly equal in their relevance to a certain
document category. Similarly, in shallow
syntactic processing tasks, like statistical
disambiguation of PP-attachment, the use of
underspecified senses may be preferable as
shown in experiments by (Krymolowski and
Roth 1998).
2 Compare (Schutze 1997) for a similar, but purely
statistical approach to underspecification in lexical
semantic processing and its use in machine learning
and information retrieval.

In order to train systems to accurately
perform syntactic analysis on the basis of
semantic classes, semantically annotated
corpora are needed. This is another area of
application of the research described here.
CoreLex clusters can be considered by
annotators as alternatives to WordNet or
GermaNet synsets if they are not able to
choose between the senses given and instead
prefer an underspecified sense. This
approach is currently tested, in cooperation
with the GermaNet group of the University
of Ttibingen, in a preliminary project on
semantic annotation of German newspaper

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962823529412">
We presented a new algorithm for
generating systematic polysemous classes
from existing resources like WordNet and
similar semantic databases. Results were
discussed for classes of English nouns as
generated from WordNet. With a threshold
of 75% similarity between nouns, 1341
classes could be found covering 3336 nouns.
Not discussed were similar experiments for
verbs and adjectives, both in English and
German. The resulting classes can be used
as filters on incremental sense
disambiguation in various applications in
which coarse grained (underspecified)
senses are preferred, but from which more
fine grained senses can be derived on
demand.

In many applications then, for instance in document categorization and other areas of information retrieval, it may be sufficient to know if a given word belongs to this group rather than to know which of its (related) senses exactly to pick. In other words, it will suffice to assign a more coarse grained sense that leaves several related senses underspecified, but which can be further specified on demandl. The approach for finding systematic polysemous classes is based on that of (Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), but takes into account some shortcomings as pointed out in (ICrymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998).

Comparison of sense distributions is now performed over synsets on all levels, not just over a small set on the top levels. In addition, similarity on sense distribution between words need no longer be complete (100%), as with the former approach. Instead, a threshold on similarity can be set that constraints a clustering algorithm for automatically grouping together words into systematic polysemous classes. (No human intervention to further group together resulting classes is required.) This approach took inspiration from the pioneering work by (Dolan 1994), but it is also fundamentally different, because instead of grouping similar senses together, the CoreLex approach groups together words according to all of their senses. Thereby following Apresjan&apos;s definition of systematic polysemy discussed above. 3.2 The Algorithm The algorithm works as follows (for example for nouns): 1. foreach noun 2. get all level, synsets (senses) 3. if number of level&apos; synsets &gt; 1 then put noun in list 4. foreach leveli synset 5. get all higher level synsets (hypemyms) 6. foreach noun&apos; in list 7. foreach noun2 in list 8. compute similarity noun&apos; and noun2 9. if simi</context>

For instance, the classes animal 1 food and plant / natural product have been discussed widely. Other classes are less 15 expected, but seem quite intuitive. The class artifact / attribute / substance for instance includes a number of nouns (&amp;quot;chalk, charcoal, daub, fiber, fibre, tincture&amp;quot;) that refer to an object that is at the same time an artifact made of some substance and that is also an attribute. 3 CoreLex-II 3.1 A More Flexible Approach The CoreLex database has been used and/or evaluated in a number of projects, leading to some criticisms of the approach in (Krymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998) and in personal communication. Primarily it was argued that the choice of basic types is arbitrary and on too high a level. Systematic class discovery in the original approach is dependent on this set of basic types, which means that classes on lower levels are not captured at all. Further criticism arose on the arbitrariness (and inefficiency) of human intervention in grouping together resulting classes into more comprehensive ones based on the similarity of their members. In response to this, a new approach was formulated and implemented that a</context>

Also in shallow processing applications like semantic pre-processing for document categorization it will be sufficient to use an underspecified sense instead of needless disambiguation between senses that are roughly equal in their relevance to a certain document category. Similarly, in shallow syntactic processing tasks, like statistical disambiguation of PP-attachment, the use of underspecified senses may be preferable as shown in experiments by (Krymolowski and Roth 1998). 2 Compare (Schutze 1997) for a similar, but purely statistical approach to underspecification in lexical semantic processing and its use in machine learning and information retrieval. 3 http://www.mietta.net/mietta 4 hup://twentyone.tpd.tno.nl/olive/ In order to train systems to accurately perform syntactic analysis on the basis of semantic classes, semantically annotated corpora are needed.
