The GREC-NEG Task at Generation Chal-
lenges 2009 required participating sys-
tems to select coreference chains for all
people entities mentioned in short en-
cyclopaedic texts about people collected
from Wikipedia. Three teams submitted
six systems in total, and we additionally
created four baseline systems. Systems
were tested automatically using a range of
existing intrinsic metrics. We also eval-
uated systems extrinsically by applying
coreference resolution tools to the outputs
and measuring the success of the tools.
In addition, systems were tested in an in-
trinsic evaluation involving human judges.
This report describes the GREC-NEG Task
and the evaluation methods applied, gives
brief descriptions of the participating sys-
tems, and presents the evaluation results.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999379210526316">
The GREC-NEG task is about how to generate ap-
propriate references to people entities in the con-
text of a piece of discourse longer than a sentence.
Rather than requiring participants to generate re-
ferring expressions (REs) from scratch, the GREC-
NEG data provides sets of possible REs for selec-
tion. This was the first time we ran a shared task
using this data. GREC-NEG is a step further from
the related GREC-MSR Task in that it requires sys-
tems to generate plural as well as singular refer-
ences, for all people entities mentioned in a text
(GREC-MSR in contrast only had singular refer-
ences to a single entity). Moreover in GREC-NEG,
possible REs for each entity are provided as one set
for each entity (rather than one set for each con-
text), so the task of selecting an appropriate RE
for a given context is harder than in GREC-MSR.
The main aim for participating systems in GREC-
NEG’09 was to select an appropriate type of RE

(name, common noun, pronoun, or empty refer-
ence).
The immediate motivating application context
for the GREC Tasks is the improvement of referen-
tial clarity and coherence in extractive summaries
and multiply edited texts (such as Wikipedia arti-
cles) by regenerating REs contained in them.
The motivating theoretical interest for the GREC
Tasks is to discover what kind of information is
useful in the input when making decisions about
different properties of referring expressions when
such expressions are being generated in context
(this is in contrast to most traditional referring ex-
pression generation work in NLG which views the
REG task as context-independent).
The GREC-NEG data is derived from the
newly created GREC-People corpus which con-
sists of 1,000 annotated introduction sections from
Wikipedia articles in the category People.
Nine teams from seven countries registered for
the GREC-NEG’09 Task, of which three teams ul-
timately submitted six systems in total (see Ta-
ble 1). We also used the corpus texts themselves
as ‘system’ outputs, and created four baseline sys-
tems. We evaluated the resulting 11 systems using
a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation meth-
ods. This report presents the results of all evalu-
ations (Section 6), along with descriptions of the
GREC-NEG data (Sections 2) and task (Section 3),
the test sets and evaluation methods (Section 4),
and the participating systems (Section 5).

Wikipedia articles in the category People. An in-
troduction section was defined as the textual con-
tent of a Wikipedia article from the title up to
(and excluding) the first section heading, the ta-
ble of contents or the end of the text, whichever
comes sooner. Each text belongs to one of three
subcategories: inventors, chefs and early music
composers. For the purposes of the GREC-NEG’09
competition, the GREC-People corpus was divided
into training, development and test data. The num-
ber of texts in the 3 data sets and 3 subdomains are
as follows:

In these texts we have annotated mentions of peo-
ple by marking up the word strings that function as
referential expressions (REs) and annotating them
with coreference information as well as syntactic
and semantic features. The subject of each text is a
person, so there is at least one coreference chain in
each text. The numbers of coreference chains (en-
tities) in the 900 texts in the training/development
sets are as shown in Table 2. The texts vary greatly
in length, from 13 words to 935, with an average
of 128.98 words.

2.1 Annotation of REs in GREC-People
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996475">
This section describes the different types of re-
ferring expression (RE) that we annotated in the
GREC-People corpus. These manual annotations
were then automatically checked and converted to
the XML format described in Section 2.2 (which
encodes slightly less information, as explained be-
low). In terminology and the treatment of syntax
used in the annotation scheme and discussion of it
in this report we rely heavily on The Cambridge
Grammar of the English Language by Huddleston
and Pullum which we will refer to as CGEL for
short below (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002).
In the example sentences below, (unbroken) un-
derlines are used for referential expressions (REs)
that are an example of the specific type of RE they
are intended to illustrate, whereas dashed under-
lines are used for other annotated REs. Corefer-
ence between REs is indicated by subscripts i, j, ...
immediately to the right of an underline (their
scope is one example sentence, i.e. an i in one ex-
ample sentence does not represent the same en-
tity as an i in another example sentence). Square
brackets indicate supplements. The syntactic com-
ponent relativised by a relative pronoun is indi-
cated by vertical bars. Supplements and their an-
chors (in the case of appositive supplements), and
relative clauses and the component they relativise
(in the case of relative-clause supplements) are co-
indexed by superscript x, y, .... Dependents inte-
grated in an RE are indicated by curly brackets.
Supplements and dependents are highlighted in
bold where they specifically are being discussed.
In the XML format of the annotations, the be-
ginning and end of a reference is indicated by
&lt;REF&gt;&lt;REFEX&gt;... &lt;/REFEX&gt;&lt;/REF&gt; tags, and
other properties discussed in the following sec-
tions (e.g. syntactic category) are encoded as at-
tributes on these tags (for details see Section 2.2).
For GREC-NEG’09 we decided not to transfer the
annotations of integrated dependents and relative
clauses to the XML format. Such dependents
are included within &lt;REFEX&gt;...&lt;/REFEX&gt; annota-
tions where appropriate, but without being marked
up as separate constituents.

We have annotated two kinds of supplements in
the GREC-People corpus, supplementary relative
clauses (CGEL, p. 1058), and appositive supple-
ments. The former is not transferred to the XML
annotation, for more information see (Belz, 2009).

2.1.3 Further aspects of the annotation

As can be seen from some of the examples above,
we annotated all embedded references. The
maximum depth of embedding that occurs in the
GREC-People corpus is 3.
We annotated all plural REs that refer to groups
of people where the number of group members is
known. For an explanation of our treatment of
REs that are coordinations of NPs, see the GREC-
NEG’09 documentation (Belz, 2009).
We have annotated all mentions of individual
person entities even if they are not actually named
anywhere in the text, and including cases of both
definite and indefinite references, e.g.:

2.2 XML Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950012">
Figure 1 shows one of the XML-annotated texts
from the GREC-NEG data. Each such text con-
sists of two initial lines of XML declarations fol-
lowed by a GREC-ITEM. A GREC-ITEM consists of a
TEXT element followed by an ALT-REFEX element.
A TEXT has one attribute (an ID unique within the
corpus), and is composed of one TITLE followed
by any number of PARAGRAPHs. A TITLE is just a
string of characters. A PARAGRAPH is any combi-
nation of character strings and REF elements.
The REF element indicates a reference, in the
sense of ‘an instance of referring’ (which could,
in principle, be realised by gesture or graphically,
as well as by a string of words, or a combination of
these). A REF is composed of one REFEX element
(the ‘selected’ referential expression for the given
reference; in the corpus texts it is the referential
expression found in the corpus).
The attributes of the REF element are ENTITY
(entity identifier), MENTION (mention identifier),
SEMCAT (semantic category), SYNCAT (syntactic
category), and SYNFUNC (syntactic function). For
full details and ranges of values see (Belz, 2009).
ENTITY and MENTION together constitute a unique
identifier for a reference within a text; together

with the TEXT ID, they constitute a unique iden-
tifier for a reference within the entire corpus.
A REFEX element indicates a referential expres-
sion (a word string that can be used to refer to an
entity). The attributes of the REFEX element are
REG08-TYPE (name, common, pronoun, empty), and
CASE (nominative, accusative, etc.).
We allow arbitrary-depth embedding of refer-
ences. This means that a REFEX element may have
REF element(s) embedded in it. See also next but
one paragraph for embedding in REFEX elements
that are contained in ALT-REFEX lists.
The second (and last) component of a
GREC-ITEM is an ALT-REFEX element which
is a list of REFEX elements. For the GREC-NEG’09
Task, these were obtained by collecting the set of
all REFEXs that are in the text, and adding several
defaults including pronouns and other cases (e.g.
genitive) of REs already in the list.
REF elements that are embedded in REFEX ele-
ments contained in an ALT-REFEX list have an un-
specified MENTION id (the ‘?’ value). Furthermore,
such REF elements have had their enclosed REFEX
removed. For example:

The test data inputs were identical to the train-
ing/development data (Figure 1), except that REF
elements in the test data do not contain a REFEX
element, i.e. they are ‘empty’. The task for par-
ticipating systems is to select one REFEX from the
ALT-REFEX list for each REF in each TEXT in the
test sets. If the selected REFEX contains an em-

to select a REFEX for this embedded REF and to set
the value of its MENTION attribute. The same ap-
plies to all further embedded REFEXs, at any depth
of embedding.

4 Evaluation Procedures

<bodyText confidence="0.998967818181818">
The GREC-NEG data set was divided into training,
development and test data. We performed eval-
uations on the test data, using a range of different
evaluation methods, including intrinsic and extrin-
sic, automatically assessed and human-evaluated,
as described in the following sections.
Participants computed evaluation scores on the
development set, using the geval-2.0.pl code
provided by us which computes Word String Ac-
curacy, REG’08-Type Recall and Precision, string-
edit distance and BLEU.

4.1 Test sets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.949328">
We created two versions of the test data for the
GREC-NEG Task:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.809772818181818">
1. GREC-NEG Test Set 1a: randomly selected 10% subset
(100 texts) of the GREC-People corpus (with the same
proportion of texts in the 3 subdomains as in the train-
ing/development data).
2. GREC-NEG Test Set 1b: the same subset of texts as in
(1a); for this set we did not use the REs in the corpus,
but replaced each of them with human-selected alterna-
tives obtained in an online experiment as described in
(Belz and Varges, 2007); this test set therefore contains
three versions of each text where all the REFEXs in a
given version were selected by one ‘author’.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
Test Set 1a has a single version of each text, and
the scoring metrics below that are based on count-
ing matches (Word String Accuracy counts match-
ing word strings, REG08-Type Recall/Precision
count matching REG08-Type attribute values)
simply count the number of matches a system
achieves against that single text.
Test Set 1b, however, has three versions of each
text, so the match-based metrics first calculate the
number of matches for each of the three versions
and then use (just) the highest number of matches.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93977">
4.2 Automatic intrinsic evaluations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944235294118">
The chief humanlikeness measures we computed
were REG08-Type Recall and Precision. REG08-
Type Precision is defined as the proportion of
REFEXs selected by a participating system which
match the reference REFEXs (where match counts
are obtained as explained in the preceding sec-
tion). REG08-Type Recall is defined as the propor-
tion of reference REFEXs for which a participating
system has produced a match.
The reason why we use REG08-Type Recall and
Precision for GREC-NEG rather than REG08-Type
Accuracy as in GREC-MSR is that in GREC-NEG
(unlike in GREC-MSR) there may be a different
number of REFEXs in system outputs and the ref-
erence texts in the test set (because there are em-
bedded references in GREC-People, and systems
may select REFEXs with or without embedded ref-
erences for any given REF).
We also computed String Accuracy, defined as
the proportion of word strings selected by a par-
ticipating system that match those in the reference
texts. This was computed on complete, ‘flattened’
word strings contained in the outermost REFEX i.e.
embedded REFEX word strings were not considered
separately.
We also computed BLEU-3, NIST, string-edit
distance and length-normalised string-edit dis-
tance, all on word strings defined as for String Ac-
curacy. BLEU and NIST are designed for multiple
output versions, and for the string-edit metrics we
computed the mean of means over the three text-
level scores (computed against the three versions
of a text). For details, see GREC-MSR report in
this volume.

4.3 Human-assessed intrinsic evaluations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920833333333">
Given that the motivating application context for
the GREC-NEG Task is improving referential clar-
ity and coherence in multiply edited texts, we
designed the human-assessed intrinsic evaluation
as a preference-judgment test where subjects ex-
pressed their preference, in terms of two criteria,
for either the original Wikipedia text or the version
of it with system-generated referring expressions
in it. The intrinsic human evaluation involved out-
puts for 30 randomly selected items from the test
set from 5 of the 6 participating systems,1 the four
baselines and the original corpus texts (10 systems
in total). We used a Repeated Latin Squares de-
sign which ensures that each subject sees the same
number of outputs from each system and for each
test set item. There were three 10x10 squares, and
a total of 600 individual judgments in this evalu-
ation (60 per system: 2 criteria x 3 articles x 10

evaluators). We recruited 10 native speakers of
English from among students currently complet-
ing a linguistics-related degree at Kings College
London and University College London.
Following detailed instructions, subjects did
two practice examples, followed by the 30 texts
to be evaluated, in random order. Subjects car-
ried out the evaluation over the internet, at a time
and place of their choosing. They were allowed to
interrupt and resume the experiment (though dis-
couraged from doing so).
Figure 2 shows what subjects saw during the
evaluation of an individual text pair. The place
(left/right) of the original Wikipedia article was
randomly determined for each individual evalua-
tion of a text pair. People references are high-
lighted in yellow/orange, those that are identical
in both texts are yellow, those that are different
are orange. The evaluator’s task is to express their
preference in terms of each quality criterion by
moving the slider pointers. Moving the slider to
the left means expressing a preference for the text
on the left, moving it to the right means preferring
the text on the right; the further to the left/right the
slider is moved, the stronger the preference. The
two criteria were explained in the introduction as
follows (the wording of the first is from DUC):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.72405275">
1. Referential Clarity: It should be easy to identify who
the referring expressions are referring to. If a person
is mentioned, it should be clear what their role in the
story is. So, a reference would be unclear if a person
is referenced, but their identity or relation to the story
remains unclear.
2. Fluency: A referring expression should ‘read well’,
i.e. it should be written in good, clear English, and the
use of titles and names should seem natural. Note that
the Fluency criterion is independent of the Referential
Clarity criterion: a reference can be perfectly clear, yet
not be fluent.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999816">
It was not evident to the evaluators that slid-
ers were associated with numerical values. Slider
pointers started out in the middle of the scale (no
preference). The values associated with the points
on the slider ranged from -10.0 to +10.0.

4.4 Extrinsic automatic evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993272727273">
An evaluation we piloted in REG’08 was an auto-
matic approach to extrinsic evaluation (for a more
detailed description, see the GREC-MSR results re-
port elsewhere in this volume). The basic premise
is that poorly chosen reference chains seem likely
to affect the reader’s ability to resolve REs. In our
automatic extrinsic method, the role of the reader
is played by an automatic coreference resolution
tool and the expectation is that the tool performs
worse (is less able to identify coreference chains)
with more poorly chosen referential expressions.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997461">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978425">
To counteract the possibility of results being a
function of a specific coreference resolution algo-
rithm or tool, we used two different resolvers—
those included in LingPipe2 and OpenNLP (Mor-
ton, 2005)—and averaged results. For the same
reason we used three different performance mea-
sures: MUC-6 (Vilain et al., 1995), CEAF (Luo,
2005), and B-CUBED (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).

<bodyText confidence="0.997772815789474">
Base-rand, Base-freq, Base-1st, Base-name:
We created four baseline systems each with a
different way of selecting a REFEX from those
REFEXs in the ALT-REFEX list that have match-
ing entity IDs. Base-rand selects a REFEX at ran-
dom. Base-1st selects the first REFEX. Base-freq
selects the first REFEX with a REG08-TYPE that
is the overall most frequent (as determined from
the training/development data) given the SYNCAT,
SYNFUNC and SEMCAT of the reference. Base-
name selects the shortest REFEX with attribute
REG08-TYPE=name.
UDel: The UDel-NEG-1 system is identical to
the UDel system that was submitted to the GREC-
MSR Task (for a description of that system see
GREC-MSR’09 results report in this volume), ex-
cept that it was adapted to the different data for-
mat of GREC-NEG. UDel-NEG-2 is identical to
UDel-NEG-1 except that it was retrained on GREC-
NEG data and the feature set was extended by en-
tity and mention IDs. UDel-NEG-3 additionally
utilised improved identification of other entities.
ICSI-CRF: The ICSI-CRF system construes the
GREC-MSR task as a sequence labelling task and
determines the most likely current class label
given preceding labels using a Conditional Ran-
dom Field model trained using the follow features
for the current reference, the most recent preced-
ing reference, and the most recent reference to the
same entity: preceding and following word uni-
gram and bigram; suffix of preceding and follow-
ing word; preceding and following punctuation;
reference ID; and whether this is the beginning of
a paragraph. If more than one class label remains,
the last in the list of possible REs in the GREC-MSR
data is selected.

splitting and POS tagging. WLV-STAND then em-

ploys a J48 decision tree classifier to obtain a prob-
ability for each REF/REFEX pair that it is a good
pair in the current context. The context is repre-
sented by the following set of features. Features
of the REFEX word string: is it the longest of the
possible REFEXs; number of words; all REFEX fea-
tures supplied in GREC-NEG data. Features of the
REF: is it part of the first chain in the text; is it the
first mention of the entity; is it at the beginning of
the sentence; all REF features supplied in GREC-
NEG data. Other features: do the preceding words
match “, but”, “and then” and similar phrases; dis-
tance in sentences to last mention; REG08-Type
selected for the two preceding REFs; POS tags of
4 words before and 3 words after; correlation be-
tween SYNFUNC and CASE values; size of the chain.
WLV-BIAS is the same except that it is retrained
on reweighted training instances. The reweighting
scheme assigns a cost of 3 to false negatives and 1
to false positives.

Also included in this table are results for the 4
baseline systems, and it is clear that selecting the
most frequent RE type given SEMCAT, SYNFUNC and
SYNCAT (as done by the Base-freq system) pro-
vides a strong baseline for RE type selection.
The last 6 columns in Table 3 contain Recall (R)
and Precision (P) results for the three subdomains.
For most of the systems results are slightly better
for Inventors than for Composers, and better for
Composers than for Chefs. A contributing factor
to this may be the fact that texts in Chefs tend to
be much more colloquial. Base-1st has by far the
worst results; this is because it selects the empty
reference in almost all cases (because ALT-REFEX
lists are sorted and if a list contains an empty ref-
erence it will end up at the beginning).
We carried out univariate ANOVAs with Sys-
tem as the fixed factor, and ‘Number of REFEXs
in a text’ as a random factor, and REG08-Type Re-
call as the dependent variable in one ANOVA, and
REG08-Type Precision in the other. The result for
Recall was F(10,704) = 81.547,p &lt; 0.001.4 The
result for Precision was F(10,722) = 79.359,p &lt;

as determined by a post-hoc Tukey HSD analysis.
Systems whose scores are not significantly differ-
ent (at the .05 level) share a letter.
Table 4 shows analogous results computed
against Test Set 1b (which has three versions of
each text). These should be considered as the
chief results of the GREC-NEG’09 Task evalua-
tions, as stated in the participants’ guidelines. Ta-
ble 4 includes results for the corpus texts, com-
puted (as are results for the system outputs in Ta-
ble 4) against the three versions of each text in Test
Set 1b. We performed univariate ANOVAs with
System as the fixed factor, Number of REFEXs as
a random factor, and Recall as the dependent vari-
able in one, and Precision in the other. The result
for Recall was F(10,724) = 72.528, p &lt; .001),
and for Precision F(10,722) = 75.476, p &lt; .001.
For both cases, we compared the mean scores with
Tukey’s HSD. As can be seen from the resulting
homogeneous subsets (letter columns in Table 4),
system ranks are the same for Precision and for
Recall. In terms of Precision, the difference be-
tween the corpus texts and the ICSI-CRF system
was not significant.

shown in Table 6. Ranks for peer systems rela-
tive to each other are very similar to the results
reported in the last section. However, the ranks of
the baseline systems have changed substantially,
both in relation to each other and to the peer sys-
tems. In particular, Base-freq has moved all the
way down to the bottom of the table. The rea-
son is that this method is geared towards select-
ing the correct type of RE, but pays no attention
to whether it selects a syntactically appropriate RE
for the given context, instead simply selecting the
first RE from the ALT-REFEX list that has the se-
lected type; in the GREC-NEG’09 Task (unlike the
GRE-MSR task) this just happens to be an RE in
the genitive case most of the time which is over-
all rarer than nominative/plain. It is likely that the
Word String scores for the UDel-NEG systems are
low for a similar reason.
We performed a univariate ANOVA with System
as the fixed factor and Number of REFEXs as a
random factor and Word String Accuracy as the
dependent variable. The result for System was
F(10,726) = 103.339; the homogeneous subsets re-
sulting from the Tukey HSD post-hoc analysis are
shown in columns 3–9 of Table 6.
Table 7 shows analogous results for human
topline Test Set 1b (which has three versions of
each text). We carried out the same kind of ANOVA
as for Test Set 1a; the result for System on Word
String Accuracy was F(10,726) = 106.755,p &lt;
0.001. System rankings and homogeneous sub-
sets are the same as for Test Set 1a; scores across
the board are somewhat higher, because of the way
scores are computed for Test Set 1b: it is the high-
est score a system achieves (at text-level) against
any of the three versions of a test set text that is
taken into account.
Results for BLEU-3, NIST and the two string-
edit distance metrics are shown in the rightmost 4
columns of Tables 6 and 7. Systems whose Word
String Accuracy scores differ significantly are as-
signed the same ranks by NIST and the two string-
edit distance metrics as by Word String Accuracy
(except for Base-1st and Base-freq which swap
ranks in some. BLEU-3 does the same and also
flips ICSI-CRF and WLV-BIAS.

sult of the experiment we had for each system and
each evaluation criterion a set of scores ranging
from -10.0 to +10.0, where 0 meant no prefer-
ence, negative scores meant a preference for the
Wikipedia text, and positive scores a preference
for the system-produced text.
The second column of the left half of Table 8
summarises the Clarity scores for each system in
terms of their mean; if the mean is negative the
evaluators overall preferred the Wikipedia texts,
if it is positive evaluators overall preferred the
system. The more negative the score, the more
strongly evaluators preferred the Wikipedia texts.
Columns 9-11 show corresponding counts of how
many times each system was preferred (+), dis-
preferred (−), and neither (0), when compared to
Wikipedia.
The other half of Table 8 shows corresponding
results for Fluency.
We ran a factorial multivariate ANOVA with Flu-
ency and Clarity as the dependent variables. In the
first version of the ANOVA, the fixed factors were
System, Evaluator and Wikipedia Side (indicating
whether the Wikipedia text was shown on the left
or right during evaluation). This showed no signif-
icant effect of Wikipedia Side on either Fluency or
Clarity, and no significant interaction between any
of the factors. There was however a mild effect of
Evaluator on both Fluency and Clarity. We ran the
ANOVA again, this time with just System and Eval-
uator as fixed factors. The result for System on
Fluency was F(9,200) = 37.925,p &lt; .001, and for
System on Clarity it was F(9,200) = 35.439, p &lt;
.001. Post-hoc Tukey’s HSD tests revealed the sig-
nificant pairwise differences indicated by the letter
columns in Table 8.
Correlation between individual Clarity and Flu-
ency ratings as estimated with Pearson’s coeffi-
cient was r = 696,p &lt; .01, indicating that the
two criteria covary to some extent.
Apart from Base-name and WLV-STAND
switching places, system ranks are the same for
Fluency and Clarity. Moreover, system ranks
are very similar to those produced by the string-
similarity scores above. Perhaps the most striking
result is that the ICSI-CRF system does succeed
in improving Fluency compared to the original
Wikipedia texts: it is preferred 9 times whereas
the Wikipedia texts are preferred only 7 times.

7 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988307692307">
This was the first time the GREC-NEG Task was
run. It is a new task not only for an NLG shared-
task challenge, but also as a research task in gen-
eral (post-processing extractive summaries in or-
der to improve their quality seems to be just taking
off as a research subfield). There was substantial
interest in the GREC-NEG Task (as indicated by the
nine teams that originally registered). However,
only 3 teams were ultimately able to submit a sys-
tem.
In particular because of the inclusion of plural
references, multiple entities per text and embed-
ded references, the GREC-NEG Task has a higher
entrance level than the GREC-MSR Task. We are
planning to run it again at Generation Challenges
2010 next year, and are considering the possibility
of providing participants with a baseline system
which would help e.g. with processing embedded
references.
We are also planning to add a named entity
recognition preprocessing task, so that this new
task in combination with GREC-NEG can be used
to perform end-to-end post-processing of extrac-
tive summaries (and other types of multiply edited
texts) to improve the clarity and fluency of the re-
ferring expressions in them.

GREC-NEG Test Set 1a: randomly selected 10% subset (100 texts) of the GREC-People corpus (with the same proportion of texts in the 3 subdomains as in the training/development data). 2. GREC-NEG Test Set 1b: the same subset of texts as in (1a); for this set we did not use the REs in the corpus, but replaced each of them with human-selected alternatives obtained in an online experiment as described in (Belz and Varges, 2007); this test set therefore contains three versions of each text where all the REFEXs in a given version were selected by one ‘author’. Test Set 1a has a single version of each text, and the scoring metrics below that are based on counting matches (Word String Accuracy counts matching word strings, REG08-Type Recall/Precision count matching REG08-Type attribute values) simply count the number of matches a system achieves against that single text. Test Set 1b, however, has three versions of each text, so the match-based metrics first calculate the number of matches for each of the three versions </context>

The attributes of the REF element are ENTITY (entity identifier), MENTION (mention identifier), SEMCAT (semantic category), SYNCAT (syntactic category), and SYNFUNC (syntactic function).
