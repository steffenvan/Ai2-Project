This paper presents experiments performed on
lexical knowledge acquisition in the form of
verbal argumental information. The system
obtains the data from raw corpora after the
application of a partial parser and statistical
filters. We used two different statistical filters
to acquire the argumental information: Mutual
Information, and Fisher’s Exact test.
Due to the characteristics of agglutinative
languages like Basque, the usual classification
of arguments in terms of their syntactic
category (such as NP or PP) is not suitable.
For that reason, the arguments will be
classified in 48 different kinds of case
markers, which makes the system fine grained
if compared to equivalent systems that have
been developed for other languages.
This work addresses the problem of
distinguishing arguments from adjuncts, this
being one of the most significant sources of
noise in subcategorization frame acquisition.

<bodyText confidence="0.999912714285714">
In recent years a considerable effort has been done
on the acquisition of lexical information. As
several authors point out, this information is useful
for a wide range of applications. For example, J.
Carroll et al. (1998) show how adding
subcategorization information improves the
performance of a parser.
With this in mind our aim is to obtain a system
that automatically discriminates between
subcategorized elements of verbs (arguments) and
non-subcategorized ones (adjuncts).
We have evaluated our system in two ways:

corpus. The purpose was to find out which was the
impact of each approach on this particular task.
The two methods of evaluation yield significantly
different results.
Basque is the subject of this study. A language
that, in contrast to languages like English, has
limited resources in the form of digital corpora,
computational lexicons, grammars or annotated
treebanks. Therefore, any effort like the one
presented here, oriented to create lexical resources,
has to be driven to do as much automatic work as
possible, minimizing development costs.
The paper is divided into 4 sections. The first
section is devoted to explain the theoretical
motivations underlying the process. The second
section is a description of the different stages of
the system. The third section presents the results
obtained. The fourth section is a review of
previous work on automatic subcategorization
acquisition. Finally, we present the main
conclusions.

1 The argument/adjunct distinction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992753157894737">
Talking about Subcategorization Frames (SCF),
means talking about arguments. Many existing
systems acquire directly a set of possible SCFs
without any previous filtering of adjuncts.
However, adjuncts are a substantial source of noise
and therefore, in order to avoid this problem, our
approach addresses the problem of the
argument/adjunct distinction.
The argument/adjunct distinction is probably
one of the most unclear issues in linguistics. The
distinction has being presented, for example, in the
generativist tradition, in the following way:
arguments are those elements participating in the
event and adjuncts are those elements
contextualizing or locating the event.
This definition seems to be quite clear, but
when we deal with concrete examples it is not the
case. For example, if we take two verbs, talk and
play.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6311075">
a. Yesterday I talked with Mary.
b. Yesterday I played soccer with Mary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998795771428572">
Here Mary is a participant of the event in both
cases, therefore under the given definition both
would be arguments. But this is contradictory to
what traditional views consider in practice. The
PP, with Mary, is considered an argument of talk
but not an argument of play. It is true that there are
differences between both of them because playing
does not require two participants (though it can
have them), while talking (under the sense of
communicating) seems to require two participants.
Finer argument/adjunct distinction have also
been proposed differentiating between basic
arguments, pseudo-arguments and adjuncts. Basic
arguments are those required by the verb. Pseudo-
arguments are those that even if they are not
required by the verb, when appearing they extend
the verbal semantics, for example, adding new
participants. And finally adjuncts, which would be
contextualizers of the event. The most radical view
is to consider the argument/adjunct distinction as a
continuum where the elements belonging to the
extremes of this continuum can be easily classified
as arguments or adjuncts. On the contrary, the
elements belonging to the central part of the
continuum can be easily misclassified. For further
reference see C. Schutze (1995), J.M. Gawron
(1986), C. Verspoor (1997), J. Grimshaw (1990),
and N. Chomsky (1995).
From the different diagnostics proposed in the
literature some are quite consistent among various
authors (R. Grishman et al. 1994, C. Pollard and I.
Sag 1987, C. Verspoor 1997).
1) The Obligatoriness condition. When a verb
demands obligatorily the appearance of an
element, this element will be an argument.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975658708333333">
a. John put the book on the table
b. *John put the book
2) Frequency. Arguments of a verb occur more
frequently with that verb than with the other
verbs.
a. I came from home (argument).
b. I heard it from you (adjunct).
3) Iterability: Several instances of the same
adjunct can appear together with a verb, while
several instances of an argument cannot appear
with a verb.
a. I saw you in Washington, in the
Kenedy Center.
b. *I saw Alice John (being John and
Alice two persons)
4) Relative order: Arguments tend to appear closer
to the verb than adjuncts.
a. I put the book on the table at three
b. *I put at three the book on the
table
5) Implicational test: Arguments are semantically
implied, even when they are optional.
a. I came to your house (from x)
b. I heard that (from x)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934538461539">
The third and fourth tests were not very useful
to us. Iterability test is quite weak because it seems
to rely more on some other semantic notions such
as part/whole relation than in the argument/adjunct
distinction. For example, sentence 3.a would be
grammatical due to semantic plausibility. The
Kennedy Center is a part of Washington, therefore
to see somebody in the Kennedy Center and see
him in Washington are not semantically
incompatible, so it is plausible to say it. In the case
of 3.b John is not a part of Alice and therefore it is
not plausible to see Alice John. But for example it
is plausible to say I saw you the hand. The relative
order test is difficult to apply on a language like
Basque which is a free word order language.
The first and fifth tests are robust enough to be
useful in practice. But only the two first
diagnostics can be captured statistically by the
application of association measures like Mutual
Information. We did not come out with any
straightforward way to apply the fifth test
computationally.
Before talking about the different measures
applied, we will present step by step the whole
process we pursued for achieving the
argument/adjunct distinction.

Our starting point was a raw newspaper corpus
from of 1,337,445 words, where there were
instances of 1,412 verbs. From them, we selected
640 verbs as statistically relevant because they
appear in more than 10 sentences.

As we said earlier, our goal was to distinguish
arguments from adjuncts. When starting from raw
corpus, like in this case, it is necessary to get
instances of verbs together with their dependents
(arguments and adjuncts). We obtained this
information applying a partial parser (section 2.1)
to the corpus. Once we had the dependents,
statistical measures helped us deciding which were
arguments and which were adjuncts (section 2.2).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999309">
2.1 The parsing phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995543">
Aiming to obtain the data against which statistical
filters will be applied, we analyzed the corpus
using several available linguistic resources:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.917754764705882">
• First, we performed morphological analysis of
the corpus, based on two-level morphology (K.
Koskenniemi 1983; I. Alegria et al. 1996) and
disambiguation using the Constraint Grammar
formalism (Karlsson et al. 1995, Aduriz et al.
1997).
• Second, a shallow parser was applied (I.
Aldezabal et al. 2000), which recognizes basic
syntactic units including noun phrases,
prepositional phrases and several types of
subordinate sentences.
• The third step consisted in linking each verb
and its dependents. Basque lacks a robust
parser as in (T. Briscoe &amp; J. Carroll 1997, D.
Kawahara et al. 2001) and, therefore, we used a
finite state grammar to link the dependents
(both arguments and adjuncts) with the verb (I.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983919222222222">
I. Aldezabal et al. 2001). This grammar was
developed using the Xerox Finite State Tool (L.
Karttunen et al. 1997). Figure 1 shows the
result of the parsing phase. In this case, both
commitative and inessive cases (PPs) are
adjuncts, while the ergative NP is an argument.
The linking of dependents to a verb is not
trivial considering that Basque is a language
with free order of constituents, and any element
appearing between two verbs could be, in
principle, dependent on any of them. Many
problems must be taken into account, such as
ambiguity and determination of clause
boundaries, among others. We evaluated the
accuracy up to this point, obtaining a precision
over dependents of 87% and a recall of 66%.
So the input data to the next phase was
relatively noisy.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999892">
2.2 The argument selection phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970196">
In the data resulting from the shallow parsing
phase we counted up to 65 different cases (types of
arguments, including postpositions and different
types of suffixes). These are divided in two main
groups:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7807948">
• 43 correspond to postpositions. Some of them
can be directly mapped to English prepositions,
but in many cases several Basque postpositions
correspond to just one English preposition (see
Table 1a.). This set also contains postpositions

<bodyText confidence="0.8535535">
that map to categories other than English
prepositions, such as adverbs (Table 1b).

<listItem confidence="0.8882655">
• 22 types of sentential complements (For
instance, English that complementizer
corresponds to several subordination suffixes:
-la, -n, -na, -nik).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923888888889">
This shows to which extent the range of
arguments is fine grained, in contrast to other
works where the range is at the categorial level,
such as NP or PP (M. Brent 1993, C. Manning
1993, P. Merlo &amp; M. Leybold 2001).
Due to the complexity carried by having such a
high number of cases, we decided to gather
postpositions that are semantically equivalent or
almost equivalent (for example, English between
and among). Even if there are some semantic
differences between them they do not seem to be
relevant at the syntactic level. Some linguists were
in charge of completing this grouping task. Even
considering the risk of making mistakes when
grouping the cases, we concluded that the loss of
accuracy due to having too sparse data
(consequence of having many cases) would be
worse than the noise introduced by any mistake in
the grouping. The resulting set contained 48 cases.
The complexity is reduced but it is still
considerable.
Most of the work on automatic acquisition of
subcategorization information (J. Carroll &amp; T.
Briscoe 1997, A. Sarkar &amp; D. Zeman 2000, A.
Korhonen 2001) apply statistical methods
(hypothesis testing). Basically the idea is the
following: they get &amp;quot;possible subcategorization
frames&amp;quot; from automatically parsed data (either
completely or partially parsed) or from a
syntactically annotated corpus. Afterwards a
statistical filter is employed to decide whether
those &amp;quot;possible frames&amp;quot; are or not real
subcategorization frames. These statistical
methods can be problematic mostly because they
perform badly on sparse data. In order to avoid as
much as possible data sparseness, we decided to
design a system that learns which are the
arguments of a given verb instead of learning
whole frames. Frames are combinations of
arguments, and considering that our system deals
with 48 cases, the number of combinations was
high, resulting in sparse data. So we decided to
work at the level of the argument/adjunct
distinction. Working on this distinction is also very
useful to avoid noise in the subcategorization
frame, because in this task adjuncts are synonyms
of noise. A system that tries to get
subcategorization frames without previously
making the argument/adjunct distinction suffers of
having sparse and noisy data.
To accomplish the argument/adjunct distinction
we applied two measures: Mutual Information
(MI), and Fisher&apos;s Exact Test (for more
information on these measures, see C. Manning &amp;
H. Schütze 1999). MI is a measure coming from
Information Theory, defined as the logarithm of
the ratio between the probability of the co-
occurrence of the verb and the case, and the
probability of the verb and the case appearing
together calculated from their independent
probability. So higher Mutual Information values
correspond to higher associated verb and cases
(see table 2).
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.788805">

pairs

erabili(to use) instrumental(with) -0.783

<bodyText confidence="0.999469041666667">
Mutual Information shows higher values for
atera-ablative(to go/take out), erabili-gisa (to use-
as). These pairs were manually tagged as
arguments, therefore Mutual information makes
the right prediction. On the contrary, atera-
instrumental (to go/take out-with), erabili-
instrumental (to use-with) were manually tagged as
adjuncts. Mutual information values in table 2 go
along with the manual tagging for these last pairs
as well, because the Mutual information values are
low as should correspond to adjuncts.
Fisher’s Exact Test is a hypothesis testing
statistical measure1. We used the left-side version
of the test (see T. Pederssen, 1996). Under this
version the test tells us how likely it would be to
perform the same experiment again and be less
accurate. That is to say, if you were repeating the
experiment and there were no relation between the
verb and the case, you would have a big
probability of finding a lower co-occurrence
frequency than the one you observed in your
experiment. So higher left-side Fisher values tell
us that there is a correlation between the verb and
the case (see table 3.)

Fisher’s Exact values show higher values for
atera-ablative(to go/take out), erabili-gisa (to use-
as). These values predict correctly the association
between the verbs and cases for these examples.
The low values for the atera-instrumental (to
go/take out-with), and erabili-instrumental (to use-
with) pairs, should be interpreted as the non-
association between the verbs and the cases in
these examples, that is to say, they are adjuncts.
And again, the prediction would be right according
to the taggers.
These tests are broadly used to discover
associations between words, but they show
different behaviour depending on the nature of the
data. We did not want to make any a priori
decision on the measure employed. On the
contrary, we aimed to check which test behaved
better on our data.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99680975">
We found in the literature two main approaches to
evaluate a system like the one proposed in this
paper (T. Briscoe &amp; J. Carroll 1997, A. Sarkar &amp;
D. Zeman 2000, A. Korhonen 2001):

1 There are two ways of interpreting Fisher’s test, as one
or two sided test. In the one sided fashion there is still
another interpretation, as a right or left sided test.

• Calculating the coverage of the obtained
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9580178">
information on a corpus. This can give an
estimate of how well the information obtained
could help a parser on that corpus.
Under the former approach a further distinction
emerges: using a dictionary as a gold standard, or
performing manual evaluation, where some
linguists extract the subcategorization frames
appearing in a corpus and comparing them with the
set of subcategorization frames obtained
automatically.
We decided to evaluate the system both ways,
that is to say, using a gold standard and calculating
the coverage over a corpus. The intention was to
determine, all things being equal, the impact of
doing it one way or the other.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9899835">
3.1 Evaluation 1: comparison of the results with a
gold standard
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997961435897436">
From the 640 analyzed verbs, we selected 10 for
evaluation. For each of these verbs we extracted
from the corpus the list of all their dependents. The
list was a set of bare verb-case pairs, that is, no
context was involved and, therefore, as the sense
of the given verb could not be derived, different
senses of the verb were taken into account. We
provided 4 human annotators/taggers with this list
and they marked each dependent as either
argument or adjunct. The taggers accomplished the
task three times. Once, with the simple guideline
of the implicational test and obligatoriness test, but
with no further consensus. The inter-tagger
agreement was low (57%). The taggers gathered
and realized that the problem came mostly from
semantics. While some taggers tagged the verb-
case pairs assuming a concrete semantic domain
the others took into account a wider rage of senses
(moreover, in some cases the senses did not even
match). So the tagging was repeated when all of
them considered the same semantics to the
different verbs. The inter-tagger agreement raised
up to a 80%. The taggers gathered again to discuss,
deciding over the non clear pairs.
The list obtained from merging2 the 4 lists in
one is taken to be our gold standard. Notice that
2 Merging was possible once the annotators agreed on
the marking of each element.
when the annotators decided whether a possible
argument was really an argument or not, no
context was involved. In other words, they were
deciding over bare pairs of verbs and cases.
Therefore different senses of the verb were
considered because there was no way to
disambiguate the specific meaning of the verb. So
the evaluation is an approximation of how well
would the system perform over any corpus. Table
4 shows the results in terms of Precision and
Recall.

The initial corpus was divided in two parts, one for
training the system and another one for evaluating
it. From the fraction reserved for evaluation we
extracted 200 sentences corresponding to the same
10 verbs used in the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; based
evaluation. In this case, the task carried out by the
annotators consisted in extracting, for each of the
200 sentences, the elements (arguments/adjuncts)
linked to the corresponding verb. Each element
was marked as argument or adjunct. Note that in
this case the annotation takes place inside the
context of the sentence. In other words, the verb
shows precise semantics.
We performed a simple evaluation on the
sentences (see table 5), calculating precision and
recall over each argument marked by the
annotators3. For example, if a verb appeared in a
sentence with two arguments and the statistical
filters were recognizing them as arguments, both
precision and recall would be 100%. If, on the
contrary, only one was found, then precision
would be 100%, and recall 50%.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998434">
It is obvious that the results attained in the first
evaluation are different than those in the second
one. The origin of this difference comes mostly, on
one hand, from semantics and, on the other hand,
from the nature of statistics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9893715">
• Semantic source. The former evaluation was
not contextualized, while the latter used the
sentence context. Our experience showed us
that broader semantics (non-contextualized
evaluation) leads to a situation where the
number of arguments increases with respect to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.965214142857143">
narrower (contextualized evaluation)
semantics. This happens because in many
cases different senses of the same verb require
different arguments. So when the meaning of
the verb is not specified, different meanings
have to be taken into account and, therefore,
the task becomes more difficult.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7630626">
• Statistical reason. The disagreement in the
results comes from the nature of the statistics
themselves. Any statistical measure performs
better on the most frequent cases than on the
less frequent ones. In the first experiment all
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993494461538461">
possible arguments are evaluated, including
the less frequent ones, whereas in the second
experiment only the possible arguments found
in the piece of corpus used were evaluated. In
most of the cases, the possible arguments
found were the most frequent ones.
At this point it is important to note that the
system deals with non-structural cases. In Basque
there are three structural cases (ergative, absolutive
and dative) which are special because, when they
appear, they are always arguments. They
correspond to the subject, direct object and indirect
object functions. These cases are not very
conflictive about argumenthood, mainly because in
Basque the auxiliary bears information about their
appearance in the sentence. So they are easily
recognized and linked to the corresponding verb.
That is the reason for not including them in this
work. Precision and recall would improve
considerably if they were included because they
are the most frequent cases (as statistics perform
well over frequent data), and also because the
shallow parser links them correctly using the
information carried by the auxiliary. Notice that
we did not incorporate them because in the future
we would like to use the subcategorization

Concerning the acquisition of verb
subcategorization information, there are proposals
ranging from manual examination of corpora (R.
Grishman et al. 1994) to fully automatic
approaches.
Table 3, partially borrowed from A. Korhonen
(2001), summarizes several systems on
subcategorization frame acquisition.
C. Manning (1993) presents the acquisition of
subcategorization frames from unlabelled text
corpora. He uses a stochastic tagger and a finite
state parser to obtain instances of verbs with their
adjacent elements (either arguments or adjuncts),
and then a statistical filtering phase produces
subcategorization frames (from a set of previously
defined 19 frames) for each verb.
T. Briscoe and J. Carroll (1997) describe a
grammar based experiment for the extraction of
subcategorization frames with their associated
relative frequencies, obtaining 76.6% precision
and 43.4% recall. Regarding evaluation, they use
the ANLT and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries as
gold standard. They also performed evaluation of
coverage over a corpus. For our work, we could
not make use of any previous information on
subcategorization, because there is nothing like a
subcategorization dictionary for Basque.
A. Sarkar and D. Zeman (2000) report results
on the automatic acquisition of subcategorization
frames for verbs in Czech, a free word order
language. The input to the system is a set of
manually annotated sentences from a treebank,
where each verb is linked with its dependents
(without distinguishing arguments and adjuncts).
The task consists in iteratively eliminating
elements from the possible frames with the aim of
removing adjuncts. For evaluation, they give an
estimate of how many of the obtained frames
appear in a set of 500 sentences where dependents
were annotated manually, showing an
improvement from a baseline of 57% (all elements
are adjuncts) to 88%.
Comparing this approach to our work, we must
point out that Sarkar and Zeman&apos;s data does not
come from raw corpus, and thus they do not deal
with the problem of noise coming from the parsing
phase. Their main limitation comes by relying on a
treebank, which is an expensive resource.
D. Kawahara et al. (2001) use a full syntactic
parser to obtain a case frame dictionary for
Japanese, where arguments are distinguished by
their syntactic case, including their headword
(selectional restrictions). The resulting case frame
components are selected by a frequency threshold.
M. Maragoudakis et al. (2001) apply a
morphological analyzer and phrase chunking
module to acquire subcategorization frames for
Modern Greek. In contrast to this work, they use
different machine learning techniques. They claim
that Bayesian Belief Networks are the best
learning technique.
P. Merlo and M. Leybold (2001) present
learning experiments for automatic distinction of
arguments and adjuncts, applied to the case of
prepositional phrases attached to a verb. She uses
decision trees tested on a set of 400 verb instances
with a single PP, reaching an accuracy of 86.5%
over a baseline of 74%.
Note that both Manning and Merlo and
Leybold&apos;s systems learn from contexts with just
one PP (maximum) per verb (finite state filter).
Our system learns from contexts with up to 5 PPs.
Furthermore, we distinguish 48 different kinds of
cases, hence the number of combinations is
considerably bigger.
Regarding the parsing phase, the systems
presented so far are heterogeneous. While
Manning, Merlo and Leybold and Maragoudakis et
al. use very simple parsing techniques, Briscoe and
Carroll and Kawahara et al. use sophisticated
parsers. Our system can be placed between these
two approaches. The result of the shallow parsing
is not simple in that it relies on a robust
morphological analysis and disambiguation.
Remember that Basque is an agglutinative
language with strong morphology and, therefore,
this stage is particularly relevant. Moreover, the
finite state filter we used for parsing is very
sophisticated (L. Karttunen et al. 1997, I.
Aldezabal et al. 2001), compared to Manning&apos;s.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976833333333">
This work describes an initial effort to obtain
subcategorization information for Basque. To
successfully perform this task we had to go deeper
than mere syntactic categories (NP, PP, ...)
enriching the set of possible arguments to 48
different classes. This leads to quite sparse data.
Together with sparseness, another problem
common to every subcategorization acquisition
system is that of noise, coming from adjuncts and
incorrectly parsed elements. For that reason, we
defined subcategorization acquisition in terms of
distinguishing between arguments and adjuncts.
The system presented was applied to a
newspaper corpus. Subcategorization acquisition is
highly associated to semantics in that different
senses of a verb will most of the times show
different subcategorization information. Thus, the
task of learning subcategorization information is
influenced by the corpus. As for the evaluation of
this work, we carried out two different kinds of
evaluation. This way, we verified the relevance of
semantics in this kind of task.
For the future, we plan to incorporate the
information resulting from this work in our parsing
system. We hope that this will lead to better results
in parsing. Consequently, we would get better
subcategorization information, in a bootstrapping
cycle. We also plan to improve the results by using
semantic information as proposed in A. Korhonen
(2001).

The system obtains the data from raw corpora after the application of a partial parser and statistical filters. We used two different statistical filters to acquire the argumental information: Mutual Information, and Fisher’s Exact test. Due to the characteristics of agglutinative languages like Basque, the usual classification of arguments in terms of their syntactic category (such as NP or PP) is not suitable. For that reason, the arguments will be classified in 48 different kinds of case markers, which makes the system fine grained if compared to equivalent systems that have been developed for other languages. This work addresses the problem of distinguishing arguments from adjuncts, this being one of the most significant sources of noise in subcategorization frame acquisition.</abstract>

We obtained this information applying a partial parser (section 2.1) to the corpus. Once we had the dependents, statistical measures helped us deciding which were arguments and which were adjuncts (section 2.2). 2.1 The parsing phase Aiming to obtain the data against which statistical filters will be applied, we analyzed the corpus using several available linguistic resources: • First, we performed morphological analysis of the corpus, based on two-level morphology (K. Koskenniemi 1983; I. Alegria et al. 1996) and disambiguation using the Constraint Grammar formalism (Karlsson et al. 1995, Aduriz et al. 1997). • Second, a shallow parser was applied (I. Aldezabal et al. 2000), which recognizes basic syntactic units including noun phrases, prepositional phrases and several types of subordinate sentences. • The third step consisted in linking each verb and its dependents. Basque lacks a robust parser as in (T. Briscoe &amp; J. Carroll 1997, D. Kawahara et al. 2001) and, therefore, we used a finite state grammar to link the dependents (both arguments and adjuncts) with the verb (I. I. Aldezabal et al. 2001).

This grammar was developed using the Xerox Finite State Tool (L. Karttunen et al. 1997). Figure 1 shows the result of the parsing phase. In this case, both commitative and inessive cases (PPs) are adjuncts, while the ergative NP is an argument. The linking of dependents to a verb is not trivial considering that Basque is a language with free order of constituents, and any element appearing between two verbs could be, in principle, dependent on any of them. Many problems must be taken into account, such as ambiguity and determination of clause boundaries, among others. We evaluated the accuracy up to this point, obtaining a precision over dependents of 87% and a recall of 66%. So</context>

While Manning, Merlo and Leybold and Maragoudakis et al. use very simple parsing techniques, Briscoe and Carroll and Kawahara et al. use sophisticated parsers. Our system can be placed between these two approaches. The result of the shallow parsing is not simple in that it relies on a robust morphological analysis and disambiguation. Remember that Basque is an agglutinative language with strong morphology and, therefore, this stage is particularly relevant. Moreover, the finite state filter we used for parsing is very sophisticated (L. Karttunen et al. 1997, I. Aldezabal et al. 2001), compared to Manning&apos;s. Conclusion This work describes an initial effort to obtain subcategorization information for Basque. To successfully perform this task we had to go deeper than mere syntactic categories (NP, PP, ...) enriching the set of possible arguments to 48 different classes. This leads to quite sparse data. Together with sparseness, another problem common to every subcategorization acquisition system is that of noise, coming from adjuncts and incorrectly parsed elements. For that reason, we defined subcategorization acquisition in terms of distinguishin</context>

Some linguists were in charge of completing this grouping task. Even considering the risk of making mistakes when grouping the cases, we concluded that the loss of accuracy due to having too sparse data (consequence of having many cases) would be worse than the noise introduced by any mistake in the grouping. The resulting set contained 48 cases. The complexity is reduced but it is still considerable. Most of the work on automatic acquisition of subcategorization information (J. Carroll &amp; T. Briscoe 1997, A. Sarkar &amp; D. Zeman 2000, A. Korhonen 2001) apply statistical methods (hypothesis testing). Basically the idea is the following: they get &amp;quot;possible subcategorization frames&amp;quot; from automatically parsed data (either completely or partially parsed) or from a syntactically annotated corpus. Afterwards a statistical filter is employed to decide whether those &amp;quot;possible frames&amp;quot; are or not real subcategorization frames. These statistical methods can be problematic mostly because they perform badly on sparse data. In order to avoid as much as possible data sparseness, we decided to design a system that learns which are the arguments of a given v</context>

And again, the prediction would be right according to the taggers. These tests are broadly used to discover associations between words, but they show different behaviour depending on the nature of the data. We did not want to make any a priori decision on the measure employed. On the contrary, we aimed to check which test behaved better on our data. 3 Evaluation We found in the literature two main approaches to evaluate a system like the one proposed in this paper (T. Briscoe &amp; J. Carroll 1997, A. Sarkar &amp; D. Zeman 2000, A. Korhonen 2001): 1 There are two ways of interpreting Fisher’s test, as one or two sided test. In the one sided fashion there is still another interpretation, as a right or left sided test. • Comparing the obtained information with a gold standard. • Calculating the coverage of the obtained information on a corpus. This can give an estimate of how well the information obtained could help a parser on that corpus. Under the former approach a further distinction emerges: using a dictionary as a gold standard, or performing manual evaluation, where some linguists extract the subcategorization frames appearing in</context>

Comparing this approach to our work, we must point out that Sarkar and Zeman&apos;s data does not come from raw corpus, and thus they do not deal with the problem of noise coming from the parsing phase. Their main limitation comes by relying on a treebank, which is an expensive resource. D. Kawahara et al. (2001) use a full syntactic parser to obtain a case frame dictionary for Japanese, where arguments are distinguished by their syntactic case, including their headword (selectional restrictions). The resulting case frame components are selected by a frequency threshold. M. Maragoudakis et al. (2001) apply a morphological analyzer and phrase chunking module to acquire subcategorization frames for Modern Greek. In contrast to this work, they use different machine learning techniques. They claim that Bayesian Belief Networks are the best learning technique. P. Merlo and M. Leybold (2001) present learning experiments for automatic distinction of arguments and adjuncts, applied to the case of prepositional phrases attached to a verb. She uses decision trees tested on a set of 400 verb instances with a single PP, reaching an accuracy of 86.5% over a baseline of 74%. Note that both Manning and </context>

These pairs were manually tagged as arguments, therefore Mutual information makes the right prediction. On the contrary, aterainstrumental (to go/take out-with), erabiliinstrumental (to use-with) were manually tagged as adjuncts. Mutual information values in table 2 go along with the manual tagging for these last pairs as well, because the Mutual information values are low as should correspond to adjuncts. Fisher’s Exact Test is a hypothesis testing statistical measure1. We used the left-side version of the test (see T. Pederssen, 1996). Under this version the test tells us how likely it would be to perform the same experiment again and be less accurate. That is to say, if you were repeating the experiment and there were no relation between the verb and the case, you would have a big probability of finding a lower co-occurrence frequency than the one you observed in your experiment. So higher left-side Fisher values tell us that there is a correlation between the verb and the case (see table 3.) Table 3.
