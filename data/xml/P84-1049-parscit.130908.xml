ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999300466666667">
This paper describes an analysis method
which uses heuristic knowledge to find local
syntactic structures of Chinese sentences. We
call it a preprocessing, because we use it before
we do global syntactic structure analysiscilof the
input sentence. Our purpose is to guide the
global analysis through the search space, to
avoid unnecessary computation.
To realize this, we use a set of special
words that appear in commonly used patterns in
Chinese. We call them &amp;quot;characteristic words&amp;quot; .
They enable us to pick out fragments that might
figure in the syntactic structure of the
sentence. Knowledge concerning the use of
characteristic words enables us to rate
alternative fragments, according to pattern
statistics, fragment length, distance between
characteristic words, and so on. The prepro-
cessing system proposes to the global analysis
level a most &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; partial structure. In case
this choice is rejected, backtracking looks for a
second choice, and so on.
For our system, we use 200 characteristic
words. Their rules are written by 101 automata.
We tested them against 120 sentences taken from
a Chinese physics text book. For this limited
set, correct partial structures were proposed as
first choice for 94% of sentences. Allowing a
2nd choice, the score is 98%, with a 3rd choice,
the score is 100%.

I. THE PROBLEM OF CHINESE
LANGUAGE ANALYSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99662353125">
Being a language in which only characters
( ideograms ) are used, Chinese language has
specific problems. Compared to languages such
as English, there are few formal inflections to
indicate the grammatical category of a word, and
the few inflections that do exist are often
omitted.
In English, postfixes are often used to
distinguish syntactical categories (e.g. transla-
tion, translat: difficult, dificulty), but in
Chinese it is very common to use the same word
(characters) for a verb, a noun, an adjective,
etc.. So the ambiguity of syntactic category of
words is a big problem in Chinese analysis.
In another example, in English, &amp;quot;-mg&apos; is
used to indicate a participle, or &amp;quot;-ed&amp;quot; can be
used to distinguish passive mode from active. In
Chinese, there is nothing to indicate participle,
and although there is a word, &amp;quot;0. &amp;quot; , whose
function is to indicate passive mode, it is often
omitted. Thus for a verb occurring in a sentence,
there is often no way of telling if it transitive
or intransitive, active or passive, participle or
predicate of the main sentence, so there may be
many ambiguities in deciding the structure it
occurs in.
If we attempt Chinese language analysis
using a computer, and try to perform the
syntactic analysis in a straightforward way, we
run into a combinatorial explosion due to such
ambiguities. What is lacking, therefore, is a
simple method to decide syntactic structure.

CHARACTERISTIC WORDS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966225272727273">
In the Chinese language, there is a kind of
word (such as preposition, auxiliary verb,
modifier verb, adverbial noun, etc..), that is
used as an independant word (not an affix). They
usually have key functions, they are not so
numerous, their use is very frequent, and so they
may be used to reduce ambiguities. Here we shall
call them &amp;quot;characteristic words&amp;quot;.
Several hundreds of these words have been
collected by linguists(2),and they are often used
to distinguish the detailed meaning in each part
of a Chinese sentence. Here we selected about
200 such words, and we use them to try to pick
out fragments of the sentence and figure out
their syntactic structure before we attempt
global syntactic analysis and deep meaning
analysis.
The use of the characteristic words is
described below.
a) Category decision:
Some characteristic words may serve to
decide the category of neighboring words. For
example, words such as &amp;quot;3 &amp;quot;, .41., -44.,
are rather like verb postfixes, indicating that
the preceding word must be a verb, even though
the same characters might spell a noun. Wbrds
like &amp;quot; &amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1k &amp;quot;, can be used as both verb and
auxiliary. If, for example, is followed by
a word that could be read as either a verb or a
noun, then this word is a verb and &amp;quot;t&amp;quot; is an
auxiliary.
b) Fragment picking
In Chinese, many prepositional phrases start

with a preposition such as &amp;quot;le&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;11&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;69&amp;quot;, and
finish on a characteristic word belonging to a
subset of adverbial nouns that are often used to
express position, direction, etc.. When such
characteristic words are spotted in a sentence,
they serve to forecast a prepositional phrase.
Another example is the pattern used
a little like &amp;quot;... is to ...&amp;quot; in English, so when
we find it, we may predict a verbal phrase from
to &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;, that is in addition the predicate
VP of the sentence.
These forecasts make it more likely for the
subsequent analysis system to find the correct
phrase early.
c) Role deciding
The preceding rules are rather simple rules
like a human might use. With a computer it is
possible to use more complex rules (such as
involving many exceptions or providing partial
knowledge) with the same efficiency. Far example,
a rule can not usually with certainty decide if a
given verb is the predicate of a sentence, but we
know that a predicate is not likely to precede a
characteristic word such as &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it . or
follow a word like .0., or &amp;quot;W. We use
this kind of rule to reduce the range of possible
predicates. This knowledge can be used in turn
to predict the partial structure in a sentence,
because the verbal proposition begins with the
predicate and ends at the end of the sentence.
In the example shown in Fig .1, fragments f3
and f4 are obtained through step (a) (see above),
fl through (b), and f2 and f5 through (c). The
symbol &amp;quot;o&amp;quot; shows a possible predicate, and &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;
means that the possibility has been ruled out.
Out of 7 possibilities, only 2 remained.

3. RESOLVING CONFLICT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856571428571">
The rules we mentioned above are written for
each characteristic word independantly. They are
not absolute rules, so when they are applied to a
sentence, several fragments may overlap and thus
be incompatible. Several combinations of
compatible fragments may exist, and fram these we
must choose the most &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; one. Instead of
attempting to evaluate the likelihood of every
combination, we use a scheme that gives different
priority scores to each fragment, and thus
constructs directly the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; combination. If
this combination (partial structure) is rejected
by subsequent analysis, back-tracking occurs and
searches for the next possibility, and so on.
Fig.2 shows an example involving conflicting
fragments. We select f3 first because it has the
highest priority. We find that f2 , f4 and f5
collide with f3, so only fl is then selected next.
The resulting combination (fl,f3) is correct.

In the preprocessing, we determine all the
possible fragments that might occur in the
sentence and involving the characteristic words.
Then we give each one a measure of priority. This
measure is a complex function, determined largely
by trial and error. It is calculated by the
following principles:

pound verbs involving &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;, occur more often than

Length is a useful parameter, but its effect

technique for Chinese language analysis.
Heuristic knowledge rules involving a
limited set of characteristic words are used to

through the search space in syntactic analysis.
Comparative processing using knowledge about
priority is introduced to resolve fragment

useful for efficient analysis of a language such
as Chinese that contains a lot of syntactic
ambiguities.
