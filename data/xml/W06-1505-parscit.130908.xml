<bodyText confidence="0.998451166666667">
In this paper, we argue that in it-clefts as
in It was Ohno who won, the cleft pronoun
(it) and the cleft clause (who won) form
a discontinuous syntactic constituent, and
a semantic unit as a definite description,
presenting arguments from Percus (1997)
and Hedberg (2000). We propose a syn-
tax of it-clefts using Tree-Local Multi-
Component Tree Adjoining Grammar and
a compositional semantics on the pro-
posed syntax using Synchronous Tree Ad-
joining Grammar.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999554">
The extant literature on the syntax of it-clefts, as
in (1), can be classified into two main approaches.
First, the cleft pronoun it is an expletive, and the
cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic
relation to the clefted constituent, such as one
of predication (Jesperson, 1937; Chomsky, 1977;
Williams, 1980; Delin, 1989; Delahunty, 1982;
Rochemont, 1986; Heggie, 1988; ´E. Kiss, 1998).
Second, the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic
or semantic relation to the cleft pronoun and is
spelled-out after the clefted constituent through
extraposition or by forming a discontinuous con-
stituent with the cleft pronoun from the base-
generated position at the end of the sentence (Jes-
person, 1927; Akmajian, 1970; Emonds, 1976;
Gundel, 1977; Wirth, 1978; Percus, 1997; Hed-
berg, 2000). Under this second approach, the cleft
pronoun is not necessarily expletive but rather has
a semantic function such as that of a definite arti-
cle.
In this paper, we argue for a particular version of
the second approach, in which the cleft pronoun
and the cleft clause form a discontinuous syntac-
tic constituent, and a semantic unit as a definite
description. We propose a syntax of it-clefts us-
ing Tree-Local Multi-Component Tree Adjoining
Grammar (MCTAG), and a compositional seman-
tics on the proposed syntax using Synchronous
Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG). In section 2, we
present arguments against the expletive approach,
and in section 3, we provide arguments supporting
the discontinuous constituent analysis. We present
our TAG analysis in section 4 and extend our pro-
posal to grammatical variations on it-clefts in sec-
tion 5.

It has been shown in Hedberg (2000) that the cleft
pronoun can be replaced with this or that, as in
(2), depending on the discourse contextual inter-
pretation of the cleft clause. The fact that the
choice of the cleft pronoun is subject to pragmatic
constraints indicates that the cleft pronoun cannot
simply be an expletive element devoid of any se-
mantic content.
(2) a. This is not Iowa we’re talking about.
(Hedberg 2000, ex. 17)
b. That’s the French flag you see flying
over there. (Hedberg 2000, ex. 20)
Although the details are different, many exple-
tive analyses advocate for the position that the
clefted constituent is syntactically associated with
the gap in the cleft clause either directly through
movement, or indirectly through co-indexation
with an operator in the cleft clause. One thing that
is common in all these analyses is that the cleft
clause is not considered to have the internal struc-
ture of a restrictive relative clause. We point out

that the initial element in the cleft clause may be
realized either as a wh-word (1) or as that (3a), or
it may be absent altogether when the gap is not in
the subject position (2, 3b). It may even be in the
form of a genitive wh-word as in (3c). The cleft
clause is thus a restrictive relative clause.

The cleft clause, however, does not relate to the
clefted constituent in the way that a restrictive rel-
ative clause relates to its head noun, as first noted
in Jespersen (1927). This is because the clefted
constituent can be a proper noun, unlike a head
noun modified by a restrictive relative clause, as
illustrated in (4). This suggests that there is no
syntactic link between the clefted constituent and
the gap in the cleft clause.

As pointed out in Percus (1997) and Hedberg
(2000), it-clefts have existential and exhaustive
presuppositions, just as definite descriptions do.
The inference in (5c) associated with (5a) survives
in the negative counterpart in (5b). This is ex-
actly the way the presupposition associated with
the definite description the king ofFrance behaves:
the presupposition spelled-out in (6c) survives in
both the affirmative (6a) and the negative counter-
part in (6b). Both authors argue that this paral-
lelism between definite descriptions and it-clefts
can be accounted for if the cleft pronoun and the
cleft clause form a semantic unit, with it playing
the role of the definite article and the cleft clause
the descriptive component. What this translates
to syntactically is that the cleft clause is a restric-
tive relative clause which is situated at the end of
the sentence, forming a discontinuous constituent
with the cleft pronoun.

b. The king of France is not bald.
c. There is one and only one king of

Percus (1997) further points out that it-clefts
pattern with copular sentences containing definite
description subjects with regard to anaphor bind-
ing. In the absence of c-command, an anaphor in
the clefted constituent position can be bound by
an antecedent inside the cleft clause, as shown in
(7a). While we don’t yet have an explanation for
how this type of binding takes place, we follow
Percus in noting that since copular sentences with
definite description subjects also exhibit this pat-
tern of binding, as shown in (7b), a uniform expla-
nation for the two cases can be sought if the cleft
pronoun and the cleft clause together form a defi-
nite description.
(7) a. It was herself that Mary saw first.
b. The one that Mary saw first was herself.
Under the discontinuous constituent analysis, it-
clefts reduce to copular sentences, and therefore
the observation that they can have equative and
predicational interpretations (Ball 1978, DeClerck
1988, Hedberg 2000), the readings attested in cop-
ular sentences, follows. For instance, (5a) (re-
peated as (8a)) can be paraphrased as (8b), and
corresponds to a typical equative sentence. And
(9a) can be paraphrased as (9b), and corresponds
to a typical predicational sentence. According to
our analysis, (8a) will be assigned the semantic
representation in (8c), and (9a) will be assigned
the semantic representation in (9c).

Inspired by work of Kroch and Joshi (1987) and
Abeill´e (1994) on discontinuous constituents re-
sulting from extraposition, we propose a tree-local
MCTAG analysis for the syntax of it-clefts. Cru-
cially, we propose that the elementary trees for
cleft pronoun and the cleft clause form a multi-
component set, as in f(αit), (Qwho won)} in Fig-
ure 1 and f(αit), (Qwho beat)} in Figure 4.

We propose to do compositional semantics us-
ing STAG as defined in Shieber (1994). In STAG,
each syntactic elementary tree is paired with one
or more semantic tree with links between match-
ing nodes. A synchronous derivation proceeds by
mapping a derivation tree from the syntax side
to an isomorphic derivation tree in the semantics
side, and is synchronized by the links specified in
the elementary tree pairs. In the tree pairs given
in Figure 1, the trees on the left side are syntactic
elementary trees and the ones on the right side are

For the derivation of predicational it-clefts as
in (9a), we use the tree pairs in &lt;(αwas kid),
(α0was kid)&gt;, &lt;(αJohn), (α0John)&gt;, and
&lt;{(αit), (βwho beat)}, {(α0it), (β0who beat)}&gt;
in Figure 4. The elementary tree in (αwas kid)
which represents a predicational copular sentence
is similar to the one in (αwas) in that in both
trees, the copula combines with a small clause FP.
The important difference is that in (αwas kid) the
subject DP is an argument substitution site and the
predicative DP (a kid) is lexicalized, whereas in
(αwas) both the subject and the non-subject DPs
are argument substitution sites. This difference is
reflected in the semantic trees, as seen in (α0was)
in Figure 1 with two term nodes and (α0was kid)
in Figure 4 with one term node. The syntactic and
semantic derivation trees, which are isomorphic,
are given in &lt;(δ9a), (δ09a)&gt; in Figure 5, and the
corresponding derived trees are given in &lt;(γ9a),
(γ09a)&gt; in Figure 6. The semantic derived tree in
(γ09a) can be reduced to the formula in (12) after
the application of λ-conversion.

(βwho won)} in Figure 1. Adjoining (βsaid)
onto the CI node in (βwho won) has the effect
of stretching the dependency between the relative
pronoun who and its gap in the cleft clause. The
derivation and the derived trees for (14) are given
in Figure 10.
To handle the coordination of the constituent
containing the clefted constituent and the cleft
clause, as illustrated in (15), we propose to use
Node Contraction and Conjoin proposed in Sarkar
and Joshi (1996). Informally, Node Contraction
takes two nodes of like categories and collapses
them into a single node, and Conjoin coordinates
the least nodes dominating the two contiguous
strings. We use the conjunction tree in Figure 11
to apply Conjoin at FP.
Figure 12 contains the elementary tree anchor-
ing equative was. We mark the nodes to be con-
tracted with a box, and augment the name of the
elementary tree with a set listing these contrac-
tion nodes. Thus, (αwas){DPi,T,Cop} means that
DPi, T and Cop nodes are marked for contraction
in (αwas) elementary tree.
Composition of (αwas){DPi,T,Cop} tree in
Figure 12 and another (αwas){DPi,T,Cop} tree
with the conjunction tree in Figure 11, along
with the substitution and adjoining of (αOhno)
and an equivalent tree (αKim) anchoring Kim,
(βwho won) and an equivalent tree (βwho lost)
anchoring lost, and (αit) in appropriate places,
yields the derived structure in Figure 13, where the
contracted nodes get identified. In this structure,
the DP hosting it is dominated by two TP nodes,
T is dominated by two TI nodes and Cop is domi-
nated by two CopP nodes. Thus, the derived struc-
ture produced by Conjoin and Node Contraction is
a directed graph, not a tree.

tendable to handle various grammatical variations
on it-clefts such as wh-extraction of the clefted
constituent, unbounded dependency between the
relative pronoun and its gap in the cleft clause
and coordination of the constituent containing the
clefted constituent and the cleft clause. In our
TAG analysis of it-clefts, the cleft pronoun and
the cleft clause bear a direct syntactic relation be-
cause the elementary trees for the two parts belong
to a single multi-component set. They do not ac-
tually form a syntactic constituent in the derived
tree, but as the elementary trees for the two belong
to the same multi-component set, the intuition that
they form a discontinuous constituent is captured.
Further, the semantics of the two trees is defined
as a definite quantified phrase, capturing the intu-
ition that they form a semantic unit as a definite
description.

We present our TAG analysis in section 4 and extend our proposal to grammatical variations on it-clefts in section 5. 2 Arguments against the expletive approach It has been shown in Hedberg (2000) that the cleft pronoun can be replaced with this or that, as in (2), depending on the discourse contextual interpretation of the cleft clause. The fact that the choice of the cleft pronoun is subject to pragmatic constraints indicates that the cleft pronoun cannot simply be an expletive element devoid of any semantic content. (2) a. This is not Iowa we’re talking about. (Hedberg 2000, ex. 17) b. That’s the French flag you see flying over there. (Hedberg 2000, ex. 20) Although the details are different, many expletive analyses advocate for the position that the clefted constituent is syntactically associated with the gap in the cleft clause either directly through movement, or indirectly through co-indexation with an operator in the cleft clause. One thing that is common in all these analyses is that the cleft clause is not considered to have the internal structure of a restrictive relative clause. We point out (1) It was cleft pronoun + copula + OHNO [who won]. clefted co</context>
<context position="4561" citStr="Hedberg (2000)" startWordPosition="751" endWordPosition="752">was Ohno Ahn beat. c. It was Ohno whose Dad cheered. The cleft clause, however, does not relate to the clefted constituent in the way that a restrictive relative clause relates to its head noun, as first noted in Jespersen (1927). This is because the clefted constituent can be a proper noun, unlike a head noun modified by a restrictive relative clause, as illustrated in (4). This suggests that there is no syntactic link between the clefted constituent and the gap in the cleft clause. (4) * Ohno that won is an American. 3 A discontinuous constituent analysis As pointed out in Percus (1997) and Hedberg (2000), it-clefts have existential and exhaustive presuppositions, just as definite descriptions do. The inference in (5c) associated with (5a) survives in the negative counterpart in (5b). This is exactly the way the presupposition associated with the definite description the king ofFrance behaves: the presupposition spelled-out in (6c) survives in both the affirmative (6a) and the negative counterpart in (6b). Both authors argue that this parallelism between definite descriptions and it-clefts can be accounted for if the cleft pronoun and the cleft clause form a semantic unit, with it playing the </context>
<context position="6618" citStr="Hedberg 2000" startWordPosition="1094" endWordPosition="1095">type of binding takes place, we follow Percus in noting that since copular sentences with definite description subjects also exhibit this pattern of binding, as shown in (7b), a uniform explanation for the two cases can be sought if the cleft pronoun and the cleft clause together form a definite description. (7) a. It was herself that Mary saw first. b. The one that Mary saw first was herself. Under the discontinuous constituent analysis, itclefts reduce to copular sentences, and therefore the observation that they can have equative and predicational interpretations (Ball 1978, DeClerck 1988, Hedberg 2000), the readings attested in copular sentences, follows. For instance, (5a) (repeated as (8a)) can be paraphrased as (8b), and corresponds to a typical equative sentence. And (9a) can be paraphrased as (9b), and corresponds to a typical predicational sentence. According to our analysis, (8a) will be assigned the semantic representation in (8c), and (9a) will be assigned the semantic representation in (9c). (8) a. It was Ohno who won. b. The one who won was Ohno. c. THEz [won(z)] [z = Ohno&apos;] (9) a. It was a kid who beat John. b. The one who beat John was a kid. c. THEz [beat(z, John&apos;)] [kid(z)] 4</context>

First, the cleft pronoun it is an expletive, and the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic relation to the clefted constituent, such as one of predication (Jesperson, 1937; Chomsky, 1977; Williams, 1980; Delin, 1989; Delahunty, 1982; Rochemont, 1986; Heggie, 1988; ´E.

Second, the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic relation to the cleft pronoun and is spelled-out after the clefted constituent through extraposition or by forming a discontinuous constituent with the cleft pronoun from the basegenerated position at the end of the sentence (Jesperson, 1927; Akmajian, 1970; Emonds, 1976; Gundel, 1977; Wirth, 1978; Percus, 1997; Hedberg, 2000).

The cleft clause, however, does not relate to the clefted constituent in the way that a restrictive relative clause relates to its head noun, as first noted in Jespersen (1927). This is because the clefted constituent can be a proper noun, unlike a head noun modified by a restrictive relative clause, as illustrated in (4). This suggests that there is no syntactic link between the clefted constituent and the gap in the cleft clause. (4) * Ohno that won is an American. 3 A discontinuous constituent analysis As pointed out in Percus (1997) and Hedberg (2000), it-clefts have existential and exhaustive presuppositions, just as definite descriptions do. The inference in (5c) associated with (5a) survives in the negative counterpart in (5b). This is exactly the way the presupposition associated with the definite description the king ofFrance behaves: the presupposition spelled-out in (6c) survives in both the affirmative (6a) and the negative counterpart in (6b). Both authors argue that this parallelism between definite descriptions and it-clefts can be accounted for if the cleft pronoun and the cleft clause form a semantic unit, w</context>

Adjoining (βsaid) onto the CI node in (βwho won) has the effect of stretching the dependency between the relative pronoun who and its gap in the cleft clause. The derivation and the derived trees for (14) are given in Figure 10. To handle the coordination of the constituent containing the clefted constituent and the cleft clause, as illustrated in (15), we propose to use Node Contraction and Conjoin proposed in Sarkar and Joshi (1996). Informally, Node Contraction takes two nodes of like categories and collapses them into a single node, and Conjoin coordinates the least nodes dominating the two contiguous strings. We use the conjunction tree in Figure 11 to apply Conjoin at FP. Figure 12 contains the elementary tree anchoring equative was. We mark the nodes to be contracted with a box, and augment the name of the elementary tree with a set listing these contraction nodes. Thus, (αwas){DPi,T,Cop} means that DPi, T and Cop nodes are marked for contraction in (αwas) elementary tree. Composition of (αwas){DPi,T,Cop} tree in Fi</context>

In STAG, each syntactic elementary tree is paired with one or more semantic tree with links between matching nodes. A synchronous derivation proceeds by mapping a derivation tree from the syntax side to an isomorphic derivation tree in the semantics side, and is synchronized by the links specified in the elementary tree pairs. In the tree pairs given in Figure 1, the trees on the left side are syntactic elementary trees and the ones on the right side are semantic trees.
