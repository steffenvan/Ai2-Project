The BA Language Technology program
was recently introduced at the North-West
University and is, to date, the only of its
kind in South Africa. This paper gives an
overview of the program, which consists
of computational linguistic subjects as
well as subjects from languages, computer
science, mathematics, and statistics. A
brief discussion of the content of the pro-
gram and specifically the computational
linguistics subjects, illustrates that the BA
Language Technology program is a voca-
tionally directed, future oriented teaching
program, preparing students for both fu-
ture graduate studies and a career in lan-
guage technology. By means of an
example, it is then illustrated how stu-
dents and researchers alike benefit from
working side by side on research and de-
velopment projects by using a problem-
based, project-organized approach to cur-
riculum design and teaching.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992484">
A new undergraduate teaching program, BA Lan-
guage Technology, was recently introduced at the
Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West Univer-
sity (NWU). The introduction of this program was
motivated by two factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990841">
(a) a need within the Faculty of Arts to develop
teaching programs that are relevant, vocationally
directed, and future-oriented; and
(b) a need in the South African higher education
system for capacity building in the field of in lan-
guage technology (PanSALB &amp; DACST, 2000).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906285714286">
To date, the BA Language Technology program
is the only one of its kind in South Africa. It has
therefore remained imperative that the program
equips students adequately to fill positions in the
emerging South African language technology in-
dustry. At the same time, students should be able
to continue with graduate studies, and therefore the
program had to be designed in such a way that stu-
dents receive an academic training that incorpo-
rates a solid theoretical component alongside the
need to get enough practical experience. These two
imperatives are reflected in the program structure,
and also in the project-based learning approach
that we adopted.

2 Program Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978347826087">
After wide consultation with international and lo-
cal role players and experts, a program was de-
signed that combines language subjects and natural
sciences (mainly computer science, mathematics
and statistics) with a core group of computational
linguistic and language technology subjects. This
section offers an overview of the BA Language
Technology program. An example of a typical pro-
gram will be given and the modules which form
part of the program will be discussed briefly.
The program has a basic core of compulsory
modules, but allows some room for students to
take modules based on personal interest and abil-
ity. A student who excels in computer program-
ming can choose to take additional modules from
that field after completing the compulsory mod-
ules. Students may also choose to take more lan-
guage or mathematics modules after completing
their compulsory modules. There are also a number
of general formative subjects that all students at the
University must take, which are not being dis-
cussed here. The basic course structure is presented
in Table 1.

The various general formative modules offered at
the university include academic literacy, study
skills, computer literacy and information skills,
philosophy and academic and scientific writing
courses. The elective modules from which the stu-
dents can choose are mathematics, computer sci-
ence and languages. The languages from which the
students can choose are Afrikaans, English or
Setswana (regular university courses) or introduc-
tory courses (foreign language level) in two South
African languages, Setswana and isiZulu and two
foreign European languages, German and French.
Students are encouraged to take at least one
South African language. This is motivated in part
by trends in the macro-political environment. In
government policy documents, such as the final
language policy presented to cabinet, language
technology is principally regarded as a means to
promote multilingualism and increase access of
information in a country with eleven official lan-
guages. In the context of the program itself, it is
expected that students acquire and/or improve their
proficiency in the various languages; students are
also expected to develop basic knowledge of the
structure of the particular languages. This basic
knowledge is then developed further in the module
“Linguistics for language technology students”
(second year, first semester). The module includes
components of phonetics, morphology and syntax,
to enable students to learn how to do detailed lin-
guistic data analysis.
In the first semester of the second year, students
are introduced to Language Technology. An over-
view of the field of study is given and it is indi-
cated how the knowledge students gained in the
modules they have completed, should be put to use
within the field. The course also focuses on the
relationship between a more practical language
technology orientation and a more theoretical natu-
ral language processing (NLP) orientation, to en-
able students to see the broader picture and
develop a sense for the coherence of the teaching
program.
Language technologies are the subject of two
modules in the second semester of the third year.
They spend equal amounts of time on speech-
based technologies and text-based technologies.
The focus of these courses is specific language
technology applications. At any given time, there
are a number of ongoing projects at the university.
Students are involved in these projects, learning to
develop the specific applications, but also develop-
ing general skills for other types of applications,
within the framework of project-based learning, as
will be outlined later in this paper. Students are
expected to participate in ongoing projects on vari-
ous levels, ranging from annotating corpora to in-
tricate programming – depending on their aptitude
and preferences.
This is followed by a six-month internship in the
first semester of the fourth year, at an approved
company or higher education or research institu-
tion. Apart from extending their training in the de-
velopment of language technology applications,
the internship is intended to let students get a “real

world” experience in the language technology in-
dustry before they have to make career decisions.
In their final semester, students have to com-
plete a supervised project, which fits in with cur-
rent research at the university. It is important that
students should be positive about this project and
therefore students are consulted when project to-
pics are chosen. In this stage of the program, stu-
dents have very little class in order to enable them
to work on their projects on a full-time base, which
provides for more practical experience.
Students are introduced to Natural Language
Processing in the first semester of the third year.
This course focuses mainly on statistical tech-
niques for the analysis of the kinds of phonetic,
morphological and syntactic data that were intro-
duced in the second semester of the second year.
The logic is that students must be able to analyze
data manually as linguists first, in order to develop
an appreciation for the capabilities, power and
limitations of statistical NLP methods.
An advanced NLP course is offered in the se-
cond semester after students have completed their
internship and while they are working on their own
projects. This course is tailored to the individual
interests and needs of the students. The specific
NLP techniques relevant to their projects, as well
as problems they encountered during their intern-
ships, serve as guiding principles for the selection
of content. At the same time, we incorporate a se-
lection of hot topics in NLP research and some
techniques for dealing with semantic data.
As computational linguistics is a relatively new
field of study in South Africa, students and lectur-
ers/researchers have to learn together, even by
making mistakes and taking ‘wrong’ sidetracks
during the learning process. In order to facilitate
these circumstances, a problem-oriented and pro-
ject-organized approach, based on the educational
system developed at the Aalborg University, Den-
mark, since 1974 (Kjersdam &amp; Enemark, 1994),
was taken in the design of the curricula of the Lan-
guage Technology and NLP modules. This means
that the content of some of the Language Technol-
ogy and NLP subjects vary from year to year, de-
pending on the current project(s) being conducted
at the university. However, by working alongside
each other on research and development projects,
both students and lecturers engage in active learn-
ing, proving to yield excellent results in the acquir-
ing of knowledge in the field. The next section
describes how various research and development
projects are integrated in the undergraduate and
graduate teaching programs, in order to facilitate
hands-on, outcome-based learning.

<bodyText confidence="0.999929046511628">
Problem-Based Learning (PBL; also called pro-
blem-oriented education) can be defined as learn-
ing “based on working with unsolved, relevant and
current problems from society/real life... By ana-
lyzing the problems in depth the students learn and
use the disciplines and theories which are consid-
ered to be necessary to solve the problems posed,
i.e. the problem defines the subjects and not the
reverse” (Kjersdam &amp; Enemark, 1994: 16; cf.
Schwartz et al., 2001; Macdonald, 2002). This ap-
proach is successfully implemented world-wide in
the teaching of specifically more applied sciences,
such as, inter alia, medicine (Albanese &amp; Mitchell,
1993; Barrows and Tamblyn, 1980; Moore et al.,
1994), and engineering (De Graaf &amp; Kolmos,
2003; Fink, 2002).
Within the context of computational linguistics,
this &amp;quot;applied-teaching approach&amp;quot; maintains a dy-
namic triangular equilibrium between training, re-
search and product development, serving
researchers, students, and the industry alike. A pro-
ject-organized approach offers lecturers an oppor-
tunity to align course material with their research
projects, while students are enabled to gain “com-
prehensive knowledge of the development of theo-
retical and methodological tools” (Kjersdam and
Enemark, 1994: 17). Therefore, after completion of
their formal studies, students should be able to
contribute to research and the development of
original paradigms to solve new and complex
problems in the future.
In the BA Language Technology program, PBL
is incorporated with project-organized education in
two ways. On the one hand various project-based
modules are included in the curriculum. For in-
stance in the third year of study, the modules
“Language Technology: Speech Applications” and
“Language Technology: Text Applications” are
introduced, where students have to develop various
small modules for both speech and text technologi-
cal applications (e.g. a simple rule-based stemmer).
In the final year of study, the largest part of the
year is spent on independent project work, which is
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999987696078432">
conducted either at the university, or while doing
an internship elsewhere. These projects are on a
much larger scale than the third year projects, with
the possibility to build on the work of the previous
year (e.g. to develop a more sophisticated stemmer,
using more advanced NLP techniques).
On the other hand, some of the other modules
(e.g. the “Natural Language Processing” modules)
are more project-driven, since they are organized
around existing research projects. Students are
mostly drawn in on a so-called “design-oriented”
level, i.e. where they have to deal with “know-how
problems which can be solved by theories and
knowledge they have acquired in their lectures”
(Kjersdam &amp; Enemark, 1994: 7). After the project
and the problems related to the project are ex-
plained to students, they get involved by collecting
data, identifying possible/different solutions, for-
mulating rules and algorithms, analyzing data,
evaluating different components, etc. In this way
they get know-how and experience in theoretical,
methodological, and implementation issues.
This can be illustrated by a recent example,
where work on a spelling checker project was inte-
grated in the curricula of various modules. In this
project, involving the development of spelling
checkers for five different South African lan-
guages, a variety of NLP techniques were imple-
mented in the various spelling checkers, depending
on the orthographical complexity of and resources
available for a specific language. For instance, lan-
guages such as Tswana and Northern Sotho have a
relatively simple orthographical structure (in the
sense that it is more disjunctive), and a straight-
forward lexicon-based approach to spelling check-
ing therefore suffice for these languages. In
contrast, Afrikaans, Zulu and Xhosa are ortho-
graphically more complex languages, requiring a
spelling checking approach based on morphologi-
cal analysis or decomposition, which is of course
more interesting from a computational linguistic
perspective. For all of these languages, almost no
resources were available at the start of the project,
posing a huge but interesting challenge (e.g. could
available technologies for other languages, such as
a Porter stemmer, be adapted for these lan-
guages?).
From the onset of the spelling checker project,
students were involved in all aspects of the project.
Using Jurafsky &amp; Martin (2000) as a point of de-
parture, students were introduced to the basic pro-
blems of spelling checking, relating it to the
current project and specifically to the challenges
posed by spelling checking for Afrikaans (e.g. pro-
ductive concatenative compound formation, deri-
vational word formation, etc.). Students were
thoroughly involved in all discussions of the aims
of the project, potential problems and possible so-
lutions, as well as the general system architecture
(i.e. students were involved on the design-oriented
level). Students were therefore introduced to basic
concepts such as tokenization, stemming, and
Levenshtein Distance (for purposes of generating
suggestions), within a real-world context.
After the planning and design phase, each stu-
dent got involved in solving different problems of
the project, e.g. developing a stemmer (using fi-
nite-state techniques) and a compound analyzer
(using machine-learning techniques), the automatic
generation of a lexicon, evaluating spelling check-
ers (within the broader context of the evaluation of
NLP applications), etc. Although each student
worked separately on different problems, they
were forced to extend their experience by helping
each other with their different tasks, thereby ex-
panding their general knowledge and experience.
In this way, students also came to learn that differ-
ent problems call for different approaches: to use
finite-state techniques for hyphenation in Afri-
kaans is simply to labor-intensive, while machine
learning offers highly efficient solutions to the
problem. An introduction to machine learning was
therefore also introduced in the curriculum.
The advantages of this approach proved to be
many: not only did the project benefit from the
sub-projects of each of the students, but students
got the feeling that they were involved in “impor-
tant” and relevant work. They got the opportunity
to apply the theoretical knowledge they acquired in
the classes in a practical, hands-on environment, to
improve their understanding of the theories and
concepts of the study field, and to solve real-world
problems. Additionally, members of staff were
enabled to harmonize their research and teaching
responsibilities, optimizing the quality and quantity
of their outputs. Moreover, existing students were
motivated to continue with their studies in compu-
tational linguistics on MA level (where they are
working on more advanced problems), while un-
dergraduate student numbers increased (which can
be ascribed to a greater awareness of language
technology in the community, brought about par-

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987176470588">
Since its very inception, the BA Language Tech-
nology program at the North-West University was
designed as a vocationally directed, future-oriented
teaching program. A curriculum with a core of
computational linguistic subjects, strengthened by
a strong foundation in languages, computer sci-
ence, mathematics, and statistics, equips students
both with enough practical experience to start
working in the industry, and with enough theoreti-
cal knowledge to continue with postgraduate stu-
dies.
By taking a problem-based, project-organized
approach to curriculum design, students and re-
searchers alike benefit from working side by side
on research and development projects (as illustra-
ted by the incorporation of a spelling checker pro-
ject in the curricula of various subjects). The same
approach is followed in other subjects, such as
&amp;quot;Language Technology: Speech Applications&amp;quot;,
where students are working in collaboration with
their lecturers on various speech-based projects. As
new research projects are initiated, the curricula of
the various subjects are adapted accordingly. For
example, in 2005 a new research project on syntac-
tic parsing commenced – consequently, new stu-
dents are confronted with other problems than their
predecessors, while still learning, for example,
about the differences between linguistic and statis-
tical approaches to NLP. With the help of students
in the program and others involved, the program is
constantly evaluated and adjusted accordingly,
thereby ensuring that it delivers well-educated and
informed students, prepared for the challenges of a
career in language technology.

Within the context of computational linguistics, this &amp;quot;applied-teaching approach&amp;quot; maintains a dynamic triangular equilibrium between training, research and product development, serving researchers, students, and the industry alike. A project-organized approach offers lecturers an opportunity to align course material with their research projects, while students are enabled to gain “comprehensive knowledge of the development of theoretical and methodological tools” (Kjersdam and Enemark, 1994: 17). Therefore, after completion of their formal studies, students should be able to contribute to research and the development of original paradigms to solve new and complex problems in the future. In the BA Language Technology program, PBL is incorporated with project-organized education in two ways. On the one hand various project-based modules are included in the curriculum. For instance in the third year of study, the modules “Language Technology: Speech Applications” and “Language Technology: Text Applications” are introduced, where students have to develop various small modules for bo</context>

At the same time, we incorporate a selection of hot topics in NLP research and some techniques for dealing with semantic data. As computational linguistics is a relatively new field of study in South Africa, students and lecturers/researchers have to learn together, even by making mistakes and taking ‘wrong’ sidetracks during the learning process. In order to facilitate these circumstances, a problem-oriented and project-organized approach, based on the educational system developed at the Aalborg University, Denmark, since 1974 (Kjersdam &amp; Enemark, 1994), was taken in the design of the curricula of the Language Technology and NLP modules. This means that the content of some of the Language Technology and NLP subjects vary from year to year, depending on the current project(s) being conducted at the university. However, by working alongside each other on research and development projects, both students and lecturers engage in active learning, proving to yield excellent results in the acquiring of knowledge in the field. The next section describes how various research and development projects are integrated in the undergraduate and graduate tea</context>

On the other hand, some of the other modules (e.g. the “Natural Language Processing” modules) are more project-driven, since they are organized around existing research projects. Students are mostly drawn in on a so-called “design-oriented” level, i.e. where they have to deal with “know-how problems which can be solved by theories and knowledge they have acquired in their lectures” (Kjersdam &amp; Enemark, 1994: 7). After the project and the problems related to the project are explained to students, they get involved by collecting data, identifying possible/different solutions, formulating rules and algorithms, analyzing data, evaluating different components, etc. In this way they get know-how and experience in theoretical, methodological, and implementation issues. This can be illustrated by a recent example, where work on a spelling checker project was integrated in the curricula of various modules. In this project, involving the development of spelling checkers for five different South African la</context>
