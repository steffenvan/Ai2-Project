Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999939944444444">
We present a semantic and pragmatic account
of the anaphoric properties of past and perfect
that improves on previous work by integrating dis-
course structure, aspectual type, surface structure
and commonsense knowledge. A novel aspect of
our account is that we distinguish between two
kinds of temporal intervals in the interpretation
of temporal operators — discourse reference inter-
vals and event intervals. This distinction makes
it possible to develop an analogy between center-
ing and temporal centering, which operates on dis-
course reference intervals. Our temporal property-
sharing principle is a defeasible inference rule on
the logical form. Along with lexical and causal
reasoning, it plays a role in incrementally resolv-
ing underspecified aspects of the event structure
representation of an utterance against the current
context.

The Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987911157894737">
The past tense has been compared with anaphoric
definite pronouns ([20] [22]) and definite noun
phrases ([27]). The supporting observation is
that in two consecutive past tense descriptions of
events, as in (1) below (from [181), the second sen-
tence refers to a time (V) whose identity depends
on the time (t) of the event described in the first
sentence.
(1)a. The Lone Ranger got on his horse. (t)
b. He rode off into the sunset. (V)
Tense interpretation also involves common-
sense inferences in that the specific relation be-
tween the two event times may vary. In (1), the
relation inferred to hold is temporal progression (t
t&apos;), but other ordering relations are also possible
(see [6] [27]). Any temporal relations are in fact
possible for two consecutively described events in
discourse.
A number of factors affect the interpretation
as to whether successive past tenses are anaphor-
ically related, and if they are, what the relative
order of the associated events is. The determinant
factors have been argued to be discourse struc-
ture ([27] [14]), aspectual type ([6] [12] [17]), sur-
face structure ([71 [14]), and commonsense knowl-
edge ([19] [27] [13]). However, no account has ad-
equately addressed all four factors.
The problem in tense interpretation that we
address is illustrated with Example (2) (from [27]).
(2)a. John went over (ti) to Mary&apos;s house.
b. On the way, he had (t2) stopped (t3) by the
flower shop for some roses. (t3 t2 (=--t1))
c. Unfortunately, they failed (t4) to cheer her
up. (t3 ti t4)
c&apos;. He picked out (t4&apos;) 5 red ones, 3 white ones
and 1 pale pink. (t3 t4&apos; ti)
(2c) and (2c&apos;) are alternative third sentences. Al-
though both are in the simple past, and both evoke
events of the same aspectual type (transition event
[23]), they are interpreted differently. We refer
to the contextually established time that a past
tense is resolved against as the &amp;quot;discourse refer-
ence time.&amp;quot; A discourse reference time (ti) is in-
troduced in (2a) with the event of John going to
Mary&apos;s house at t1.1 The past perfect in (2b) in-
troduces two times: John&apos;s stopping at the flower
shop (t3) precedes the time t2 (t3 t2), and t2 is
typically inferred to be equal to the time of going
over to Mary&apos;s house (ti); hence t3 ti. In (2c),
the time of failing to cheer Mary (t4) is inferred
to occur just after ti, whereas in the parallel ver-
sion (20, the time of picking out roses (t4&apos;) is
inferred to occur during or just after t3, thus be-
fore ti. Thus, as noted by Webber [27], a past
perfect evokes two temporal referents (e.g., t2 and
t3) and either of them can provide a discourse ref-
erence time for a subsequent past tense.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.98975325">
1Later we will see that although the first tense gen-
erates a discourse reference time for the subsequent
one, its temporal referent (here ti) is not precisely
equivalent to it.

Another aspect of the problem in tense in-
terpretation is illustrated with so-called extended
flashbacks such as Example (3), similar to the one
discussed in [14].
(3) John and Mary went to buy a lawnmower.
Somebody had stolen theirs the day before.
They had seen the thief go away. John had
run after him to no avail. All the lawnmow-
ers were too expensive. They decided they
couldn&apos;t afford a new one.
There are two narrative threads in (3), one de-
scribing John and Mary&apos;s visit to a store, the other
John&apos;s chase of the thief. These threads corre-
spond to the repeated use of the past and of the
past perfect, respectively. The return from the
past perfect to the past in also coincides with the
return to the earlier thread. Note that (i) not
only the simple past but also the past perfect
can achieve an effect of continuity and that (ii)
more than one discourse reference time needs to
be maintained in order to account for the return
to an earlier one.
The general problem in tense interpretation
that we address is how to keep track of all the po-
tential discourse reference times in a context, and
how to select the right one for a given anaphoric
past tense.
We argue that the choice of the discourse an-
tecedent of a temporal operator is subject to cen-
tering effects. We assume that each temporal op-
erator in a sentence introduces a discourse refer-
ence time into the discourse context. We claim
that this set of times constitutes a list of poten-
tial discourse reference times for the next sentence,
which we&apos;ll later refer to as the temporal forward-
looking center (TCf), and that the position of a
temporal operator in the logical form of the sen-
tence affects the choice of the antecedent through
structural parallelism (as a case of the property-
sharing effect in centering [161).
We formalize the effect of surface structure on
the choice of temporal antecedent by means of de-
feasible axioms. These axioms must be less specific
than axioms encoding causal reasoning. We argue
that the choice of discourse reference time is an
instance of a general principle in defeasible rea-
soning, namely, the Penguin Principle [19] that
chooses the most specific axiom applicable. We
support our claims with data from the Brown cor-
pus.
In the next section, we review the three ex-
isting proposals most related to ours — Webber
[27], Lascarides and Oberlander [19], and Hwang
and Schubert [14]. The next two sections present
a review of centering followed by a discussion of
the analogous effects of temporal centering. To
account for temporal centering effects, we then
present our tense rules and our account of how
commonsense reasoning interacts with the default
preferences generated by the surface structure.

Webber [27] argues that temporal entities are
subject to focusing processes analogous to those
constraining the interpretation of definite noun
phrases. She explicitly rejects, however, a more
direct analogy to Sidner&apos;s [26] potential local foci,
and assumes only one temporal referent in the
temporal focus (TF).
Lascarides and Oberlander [19] present de-
feasible reasoning rules for narrative understand-
ing that partly address the reasoning and control
needs of Webber&apos;s model. For example, they argue
that in the case of conflicting inferences regard-
ing the temporal order of two times [e.g., whether
precedes, follows, or overlaps], the most specific
interpretation should be preferred. However, they
do not address cases such as (2), where there are
multiple possible discourse reference times and the
choice of one interpretation over the other needs
to be accounted for.
Hwang and Schubert [14] intend to account
for the role played by structural factors in the
choice of anaphoric relations among distinct past
tenses. They propose the contextual structures
called tense trees built as a narrative gets inter-
preted. Tense trees reflect the structural depen-
dencies among the tense and aspect operators in
the interpretation of the sentences. The events
evoked by a sentence are &amp;quot;appended&amp;quot; to the tree
nodes whose positions reflect the structural posi-
tions of the corresponding temporal operators in
the sentence.
Webber [27] and Hwang and Schubert [14] dif-
fer markedly regarding the relative weight they
assign to commonsense inferences versus surface
structure, but both have problems with examples
like (2). Neither can readily account for the in-
terpretation assigned to (2c&apos;). Webber assumes
that the TF of (2b) is initially ti, but shifts to t3,
thus initiating an embedded segment, after (2c&apos;)
has been processed sufficiently to recognize that
TF=t3 yields a more sensible interpretation than
TF=t2(=t1). She does not discuss how t3 comes
to be considered as a potential TF in this case,
much less how to reject t2(=t1). Like Webber,
Hwang and Schubert assume that (2c&apos;) requires
recognition of an embedded segment, but admit-
tedly they have not resolved the conflict between
the need for discourse segment recognition, a task
for commonsense reasoning, and the clear sepa-
ration of tense resolution from commonsense rea-
soning that they advocate. They also fail to dis-
tinguish betwen the hierarchical structures of sen-

tences and discourses in the tense tree. Tense tree
thus overcommits in places where the rule should
belong to defeasible preferences.
Our approach is to formulate the structural
preferences for tense resolution as defeasible rules
analogous to centering preferences for pronoun res-
olution. These structural preferences, which are
overlooked in Webber&apos;s or Lascarides and Ober-
lander&apos;s accounts, interact with the commonsense
inferences used in tense interpretation.

Centering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997974159090909">
Centering [9] is a refinement of Sidner&apos;s [26] local
focusing model. It consists of a set of principles
and rules for dynamically updating the local at-
tentional state [11] in discourse processing.
We assume the following general picture of
discourse processing. A discourse consists of a se-
quence of utterances utti, uttn. The sentence
grammar translates the content of each utterance
utti into a (set of) surface logical form(s) contain-
ing unresolved anaphoric expressions and opera-
tors. We call it here a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; formula (h. This
logical form is similar, in spirit, to Hwang and
Schubert&apos;s [14] indexical formula and Alshawi&apos;s [2]
quasi logical form, whose main motivations are to
represent that part of the sentence meaning in-
dependent from the particular discourse context.
This &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; meaning representation acts as a
clean interface to the pragmatic processing needed
to resolve context-dependent expressions. Utter-
ance interpretation takes place in a context, and
outputs an updated context. Part of this dynamic
context is the attentional state that represents the
currently salient entities partially ordered by rel-
ative salience.
We say that each formula cbi defines a transi-
tion relation between the input attentional state
AS,_ and the output attentional state ASi. An
attentional state ASi contains the focus of atten-
tion Foci whose most salient subpart is the center
of attention. After resolving anaphoric expressions
in j, the center of attention contains a partially
ordered set of forward-looking centers C fi com-
prising the entities realized in Oi . A member of
C fi might (but need not) be the backward-looking
center Cbi, the currently most salient entity.
Centering has mainly been used to constrain
how discourse anaphoric pronouns are processed;
e.g., the centering rule [9] predicts that Cbi will
be realized with a pronoun if Cb1=Cb1_1.2 Also,
when Cbi=Cbi_i and both are realized by definite
pronouns, it is predicted that both will be real-
21.1ere we avoid the complication acknowledged in
[11] that the two relevant utterances need not literally
be adjacent.

ized in a common grammatical role, with subject
preferred over non-subject [16] [24]. A number of
transition relation types have been distinguished
in centering. In this paper, we will use the fol-
lowing four types: Cb-retention, Cb-establishment,
Cb-resumption, and NULL-transition.3
In Cb-retention, the same entity is retained
as the Cb: Cbi_i = Cbi 0 NULL. In Cb-
establishment, another member of Cf becomes
the Cb: Cbi_i Cbi, Cbi E Cfj_i (Cbi_i may
be NULL). These two are the most relevant to
the present paper. In Cb-resumption, an old Cb
not in Cf but in the current Foc is resumed.
In NULL-transition, the output state has no Cb
(Cbi=NULL). Centering posits a default prefer-
ence for retention over establishment. We pro-
visionally assume that establishment is preferred
over resumption or NULL-transition.
We illustrate centering with Fig. 1, where c
and c&apos; are alternative continuations of b. After a.,
C fi contains two entities, John&apos; and storel. In b.,
John&apos; is referred to with a subject pronoun, and
is established as Cb2. In c., because John&apos; is the
current Cb, and because retention is preferred over
establishment, centering predicts that a subject
pronoun will refer to John&apos; rather than to Bill&apos;.
The default is overridden in c&apos; and instead, the
subject pronoun is inferred to refer to Bill&apos; because
it is likely that the perceiver in the first perceptual
state, see&apos;, remains the perceiver in the subsequent
perceptual state, appear&apos;.
3Cb-retention and Cb-establishment are due to
Kameyama [15] [16]. These two roughly correspond
to the three [10] and four [5] transition types pro-
posed elsewhere. Cb-resumption captures Sidner&apos;s [26]
use of a discourse focus stack in the potential focus
list, and can be analogously formalized as a Cb stack
within the Cf. NULL-transition has been implicit in
Kameyama&apos;s work but has not been made an explicit
transition type.

Centering effects in tense
interpretation
Our proposal is motivated by the parallel between
example (2) above and the centering example in
Fig. 1. As illustrated in Figure 2, we would
like to say that utterances (2a) and (2b) share
the same discourse reference time rl that links t2
to ti. The shared discourse reference time rl is
thereby established as a backward-looking tempo-
ral center (TCb). (2c) retains the TCb, linking t4
to t2(=t1), whereas (2c&apos;) establishes a new TCb,
linking t4&apos; to t3.
In order to establish a direct analogy between
centering and temporal centering, however, we
need to first clarify the nature of the temporal
entities in the attentional state. Note that if (2c)
retains the &amp;quot;same&amp;quot; TCb, this TCb cannot be iden-
tified with either t2 of (2h) or t4 of (2c), since t2
and t4 are distinct (t1=t2, ti t4). The TCb
remains fixed while the event times within it may
move forward or backward. The TCb is then quite
different from the reference time as used in propos-
als inspired by Reichenbach [25] such as Dowty&apos;s
[6] and Hinrichs [12]).4 Recall the extended flash-
back example (3) above. There are two simulta-
neous narrative threads, in the simple past and in
the past perfect, and the former seems to remain
somehow in the background while the latter is in
the foreground. These examples seem to indicate
that when processing a text a reader maintains
a list of &amp;quot;potential foci&amp;quot; ordered by their relative
salience, instead only one temporal focus, as in
Webber&apos;s account.
Further evidence in favor of the analogy was
obtained by examining a random sample of dis-

[17], where they argue for the separation of the tem-
poral perspective point (TPpt) that is relatively fixed
and the reference point (Rpt) that moves with narra-
tive progression.
course sequences from the Brown corpus [8], a
heterogeneous corpus that should yield unbiased
data. Each multi-sentence sequence contained
one of two types of trigger sentences with multi-
ple temporal operators — the past perfect matrix
clause or the past matrix verb taking an embed-
ded past or past perfect complement clause (e.g.,
John remembered that Mary had asked for roses).
We observed that this trigger&apos;s output TCb was
almost always the time associated with the super-
ordinate operator. Following each trigger was a
target sentence with a simple past matrix clause.
This creates a sequence analogous to (2b-c) or
(2b-c&apos;). We analyzed each sequence to determine
whether the discourse reference time for the past
in the target sentence was introduced by the trig-
ger&apos;s superordinate operator (as a case of TCb-
retention) or by a subordinate operator (as a case
of TCb-establishment). In the total of 80 exam-
ples, we found 52 retentions (65%) and 12 estab-
lishments 15%). Others included 9 cases of &amp;quot;nei-
ther&amp;quot; (11%) (some combination of resumption and
NULL-transition) and 7 undecidable cases (9%).
These data are consistent with our hypothesis that
in a sentence with multiple temporal operators,
the relative likelihood that a given temporal op-
erator provides the discourse reference time for a
subsequent past depends on its syntactic promi-
nence. The question is, how do temporal centering
and commonsense reasoning interact to yield the
observed results?

Two levels of logical representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990302541666666">
Our explanation for the interaction between tem-
poral centering and commonsense reasoning rests
on assuming two distinct levels of representation
in sentence interpretation. One is the logical form
independent from the context and obtained by a
direct translation of the surface syntactic structure
of the utterance. The other is a fully resolved log-
ical expression that results from incrementally re-
solving context-dependent expressions in the log-
ical form. For simplicity, our discussion ignores
anything but temporal operators.
Much as in Hwang and Schubert&apos;s proposal
[14], the logical form contains unresolved tempo-
ral operators — e.g., tense operators, PRES(ent)
and PAST, and aspectual operators, PERF(ect) and
PROG(ressive). It also represents the structural po-
sition of the temporal operators in a sentence. The
crucial difference is that we take each tense and
aspect operator to also give rise to a discourse ref-
erence interval (see below) that is contextually re-
solved. Our logical forms for (2a) and (2b) are
shown in (4).

The temporal operators in our logical forms
are translated into the language of what we call the
event structure representation (ESR). In essence,
ESR represents the temporal and causal relations
among the eventualities described in discourse.
We will use Allen&apos;s [1] interval representation
scheme for this representation level. Described
eventualities correspond to event intervals and
what we have been calling the &amp;quot;discourse reference
times&amp;quot; correspond to discourse reference intervals.
To represent relations among these temporal inter-
vals, we use disjunctive subsets of Allen&apos;s thirteen
relations. With Allen&apos;s representation, we can di-
rectly represent vague or ambiguous temporal rela-
tions expressed in natural language and incremen-
tally resolve them to more specific relations using
constraint propagation. Our discourse reference
intervals coincide exactly with the computational
role of Allen&apos;s reference intervals.

Tense mapping rules

<bodyText confidence="0.99911447368421">
Now we define the recursive mapping T be-

representation.5 These tense mapping rules &amp;quot;un-
pack&amp;quot; the relations among relevant event inter-
vals and discourse reference intervals encoded by
temporal operators in the logical form, and gen-
erate the initial event structure representation.
Although these rules look similar to Hwang and
Schubert&apos;s tense deindexing rules, they play a very
different role. Rather than performing sentence
interpretation, as their deindexing rules do, our
mapping rules specify the semantics of the logical
form in terms of the event structure representa-
tion. The r rules for PAST and PERF are shown in
Fig. 3.
We assume that formulas denote sets of time
intervals. For every clause associated with a for-
mula OP0, where OP is a temporal operator (PAST
or PERF) and 0 is a formula, there is an event inter-

val e corresponding to the specific time for which
0 is inferred to hold. We express this relation as
e k 4 (e supports 0). A statement of this form
evaluates to true if the denotation of e is an ele-
ment of the denotation of 0.
Each event interval e is temporally included
in a discourse reference interval r, semantically
treated as an open variable — the value of r is
constrained by contextual factors such as tempo-
ral centering and commonsense reasoning, as de-
scribed in a later section.
SuperNow and SuperRef have values deter-
mined by the position of the subformula 0P0 in the
logical form. SuperNow evaluates to the current
utterance interval — the time interval in which
the current utterance takes place. We assume that
there is an updating mechanism for SuperNow de-
fined for each utterance initiation including the
onset of a quoted speech. SuperRef evaluates to
the event interval evoked by the temporal opera-
tor that immediately dominates the current one in
the logical form.
Starts_before, a disjunction of meets, pre-
cedes and the inverse of finishes (m -.&lt; fi), is
the possible relation between e and SuperNow for
any PASTO (or between e and SuperRef for any
PERU)), irrespective of the aspectual type of 0.
Orients, borrowed from Hwang and Schubert, is
the disjunctive set of all of Allen&apos;s thirteen re-
lations. Both starts_before and orients may be
further specialized after computing 0&apos;s aspectual
type, which depends partly on the aspectual types
of its constituents and partly on commonsense
reasoning.&apos; We can state certain default speci-
fications of orients. For example, involving two
transition event intervals, orients defaults to pre-
cedes (e.g., see (1) where t -.&lt; t &apos; ). Stative inter-
vals by default overlap other non-stative or stative
intervals (cf. [6] [12]).
LastIn(r) is a function defined over dis-
course reference intervals, and evaluates to the
most recent non-stative event interval in the dis-
course reference interval r, where applicable. This
event interval orients the new event interval e.
LastIn(r) corresponds to the &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot; that
moves with narrative progression in approaches
like Dowty [6] and Hinrichs [12].

val is assumed to persist up through the present.
Thus t2 starts_bef ore ub is specialized to t2

k [3, with discourse reference interval r3 such that
t3 C r3. SuperRef evaluates to t2, the event in-
terval of the dominating PAST operator, yielding
t3 starts_before t2, which is then specialized
to t3 t2 due to the aspectual types of PERF/3
and [3.
The interaction between structural
factors and causal knowledge
We propose that defeasible rules producing hy-
potheses about the interpretation of an utterance
operate on both the levels of representation used
in tense interpretation. On the event structure
representation level, we assume the existence of
axioms formalizing lexical semantics and other as-
pects of commonsense knowledge (e.g., [13] [19]),
and call them causal axioms. Simplified examples
are given in (6) and (7) below. We use the default
conditional &gt; introduced by Asher and Morreau

The other, more novel, assumption we make
is that there are defeasible rules that operate on
the logical form, on the basis of structural infor-
mation only. We formalize the effects of structural
information in terms of what we call logical form
axioms. Much as in the case of axioms formaliz-
ing commonsense knowledge, logical form axioms
can be defeasible. Although the effects of struc-
tural factors on anaphora interpretation are widely
acknowledged in linguistic theories (e.g., binding
theory), the interest is more on indefeasible gram-
matical principles. Our logical form axioms en-
code grammatically derived defeasible preferences,
the kind of structural effects that centering and
temporal centering uncover.
We assume the following architecture for sen-
tence interpretation. Once the logical form has
been obtained, logical form reasoning takes place.
There are two kinds of rules in logical form reason-
ing — monotonic (or indefeasible) and defeasible.
The former rewrite the logical form, and the lat-
ter generate logical form hypotheses, that are addi-
tional logical form expressions. All of the hypothe-
ses resulting from logical form reasoning, as well as
the original interpretation, are then mapped into
event structure representations, and causal axioms
are used to complete the interpretation. All com-
plete interpretations of a sentence are compared
to find the best hypothesis.
We propose to encode temporal centering as
defeasible logical form axioms that generate logi-
cal form hypotheses about the interpretations of
unresolved discourse reference intervals. To be
more precise, we claim that the following principle
holds:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.699951">
Temporal Property-sharing Principle (TPP)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998835">
Resolve the current discourse reference interval
ri against a discourse reference interval ri in the
attentional state. By default, ri and ri should
share the same property reflecting the temporal
position in the logical form.
This general preference can be encoded by
means of logical form axioms of the type shown
in (8), whose intended interpretation is as follows
— Let uttn_i and uttn be two consecutive ut-
terances in discourse, lf (utt) be a function from
utterances to their logical forms, (PASTri (D) be
a subformula of lf(uttn_i), (PASTr2 T) be a

function from pairs of a formula lfl and a sub-
formula 1f2 into the &amp;quot;temporal position&amp;quot; of 1f2 in
lfl. The temporal position of a subformula in a
formula is the sequence of higher temporal oper-
ators of the subformula. For example, in the for-

A similar rule generates hypotheses about the
identity of two discourse reference intervals both
introduced by PERF operators in the same tempo-
ral positions.
Lascarides and Oberlander [19] propose the
Penguin Principle as a way of choosing among
conflicts generated by the application of defeasible
rules. The principle says that whenever a conflict
between rules arises, the hypothesis obtained by
applying the most specific rule should be chosen.
The logical form axioms encode general knowledge
of linguistic structures independent from particu-
lar events or situations being described. Thus the
information they encode is necessarily less specific
than rules encoding lexical inferences and causal
relations. Hence the following consequences on the
TPP:
The TPP applies in the absence of informa-
tion about causal relation between the events.
Any hypothesis that results from causal rea-
soning is preferred over the hypothesis sug-
gested by the TPP.
This general pattern of interaction between
causal and logical form axioms predicts the fol-
lowing Temporal Centering Principle:
Temporal Centering Principle (TCP) When cbi
evokes a set of unresolved discourse reference
intervals r1, rn, each rk is resolved against
the current atttentional state as follows — (i) IF
causal axioms generate a hypothesis, take it, (ii)
ELSE IF the TPP generates a hypothesis, take
it, (iii) ELSE r1,...,rn are new to the discourse.
After resolution, r1, rn are in the TC I1 in the
output context of 0i.
Case (i) of the TCP allows any of the four transi-
tion types, retention, establishment, resumption,
or NULL. A NULL-transition only result only
from negative conclusions obtained from causal
axioms. Under the TPP in the form of rule
(8) that applies only on consecutive utterances,
case (ii) would result in either TCb-retention
or TCb-establishment, but not TCb-resumption.
How does this accord with our corpus data dis-
cussed earlier? In the most frequent (65%) TCb-
retention, the discourse reference interval evoked
by the matrix past tense is identified with an-
other evoked by the matrix past tense in the pre-
vious utterance. In the next frequent (15%) TCb-
establishment, it is identified with the one evoked
by the subordinate temporal operator. This sharp
difference in frequency would be explained by the
fact that the TPP supports the former but not the
latter.
Webber&apos;s example, revisited.
We now go back to Webber&apos;s example (2) and ex-
plain how the interactions of defeasible rules result
in the temporal centering transitions shown in Fig.
2. The input consists of the logical forms from Ta-
ble 1.
(2a) For the initial sentence of discourse, only the
NULL-transition can apply. r1 is not identified,
and remains as an open variable. AS1 contains
TC fi=[r].].
(213) The TPP can apply for PAST; resulting in
TCb-establishment, with r1=.--r2. As a re-
sult, TCf2=[rl,r3], TCb2=r1, and the value of
LastIn(r2)=LastIn(r1) is t1. This yields ti
orients t2, where t1 is the transition event
interval for (a) and t2, for a state (PERF f3).
When a non-stative event interval orients a
stative event interval, the former is partly cov-
ered by (overlaps, starts, finishes, equals, during,
or their inverses) the latter by default.
(2c) The TPP, in the form of rule (8), generates
the hypothesis expressed by the following log-
ical form: (PASTr4.ri &apos;The roses fail to
cheer her&apos;). The causal reasoning generates
the same conclusion, namely, in order to give
somebody flowers, one has to be at somebody&apos;s
place, so we conclude that the &apos;failing-to-cheer
event&apos; continues the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of John&apos;s going
over to Mary&apos;s house. Either way, we have a
TCb-retention, yielding TC f3 =[r1(=r4)] and
TCb3=r1. The value of LastIn(r4) is now ti,
yielding ti orients t4. Since t1 and t4 are
event intervals for transition events (a and 7),
orients defaults to ti t4.
(2c&apos;) There is a conflict. While the TPP would sug-
gest a continuation of the story of John&apos;s visit
at Mary&apos;s house, the causal rules such as (6)
suggest that the event of picking up flowers
takes place at the florist&apos;s, and the rules such
as (7) suggest that being at the florist&apos;s results
from the action of &amp;quot;stopping by&amp;quot; the florist&apos;s.
The Penguin Principle now applies, resulting in
TCb-establishment, and t3 t4.

Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999390625">
We have presented a semantic and pragmatic ac-
count of the past tense that uniformly accounts for
its discourse anaphoric properties. We distinguish
between two kinds of intervals, discourse reference
intervals and event intervals, which allows us to
provide a direct analogy between centering and
temporal centering.
We introduce the notion of logical form rea-
soning, which obviates the need for tense trees as
the source for structural reasoning, and, at the
same time, enables us to account for the interac-
tion between the structural preferences and causal
reasoning. By including in both logical form ex-
pressions and event structure representation an ex-
plicit indication of the contextual parameters to be
resolved, rules can be formulated that exploit the
kind of information available at each level. We
can therefore factor out different sources of de-
feasible preferences in tense interpretation. Rules
operating on the logical form formalize the effects
of structural factors, and rules operating on the
event structure formalize the effects of common-
sense knowledge.
The ordering preferences in our Model are con-
sistent with data from a large, heterogeneous cor-
pus. In the future work, we need to develop an
evaluation method for our model, to specify more
fully the knowledge representation and reasoning
needs, and finally to clarify consequences that our
model might have on a more unified model of at-
tentional state to simultaneously account for nom-
inal and temporal anaphora.

<abstract confidence="0.994988555984559">We present a semantic and pragmatic account of the anaphoric properties of past and perfect that improves on previous work by integrating discourse structure, aspectual type, surface structure and commonsense knowledge. A novel aspect of our account is that we distinguish between two kinds of temporal intervals in the interpretation of temporal operators — discourse reference intervals and event intervals. This distinction makes it possible to develop an analogy between centering and temporal centering, which operates on disreference intervals. Our propertyprinciple a defeasible inference rule on the logical form. Along with lexical and causal reasoning, it plays a role in incrementally resolving underspecified aspects of the event structure representation of an utterance against the current context. The Problem The past tense has been compared with anaphoric definite pronouns ([20] [22]) and definite noun phrases ([27]). The supporting observation is that in two consecutive past tense descriptions of events, as in (1) below (from [181), the second sentence refers to a time (V) whose identity depends on the time (t) of the event described in the first sentence. (1)a. The Lone Ranger got on his horse. (t) b. He rode off into the sunset. (V) Tense interpretation also involves commonsense inferences in that the specific relation between the two event times may vary. In (1), the relation inferred to hold is temporal progression (t t&apos;), but other ordering relations are also possible (see [6] [27]). Any temporal relations are in fact possible for two consecutively described events in discourse. A number of factors affect the interpretation as to whether successive past tenses are anaphorically related, and if they are, what the relative order of the associated events is. The determinant have been argued to be struc- [14]), type [12] [17]), surstructure ([71 and knowl- [27] [13]). However, no account has adequately addressed all four factors. The problem in tense interpretation that we address is illustrated with Example (2) (from [27]). (2)a. John went over (ti) to Mary&apos;s house. b. On the way, he had (t2) stopped (t3) by the flower shop for some roses. (t3 t2 (=--t1)) c. Unfortunately, they failed (t4) to cheer her up. (t3 ti t4) c&apos;. He picked out (t4&apos;) 5 red ones, 3 white ones and 1 pale pink. (t3 t4&apos; ti) (2c) and (2c&apos;) are alternative third sentences. Although both are in the simple past, and both evoke events of the same aspectual type (transition event [23]), they are interpreted differently. We refer to the contextually established time that a past tense is resolved against as the &amp;quot;discourse reference time.&amp;quot; A discourse reference time (ti) is introduced in (2a) with the event of John going to house at The past perfect in (2b) introduces two times: John&apos;s stopping at the flower (t3) time t2 (t3 t2), and t2 is typically inferred to be equal to the time of going over to Mary&apos;s house (ti); hence t3 ti. In (2c), the time of failing to cheer Mary (t4) is inferred occur just whereas in the parallel version (20, the time of picking out roses (t4&apos;) is to occur just thus be- Thus, as noted by Webber [27], a past perfect evokes two temporal referents (e.g., t2 and t3) and either of them can provide a discourse reference time for a subsequent past tense. we will see that although the first tense generates a discourse reference time for the subsequent one, its temporal referent (here ti) is not precisely equivalent to it. 70 Another aspect of the problem in tense inis illustrated with so-called as Example (3), similar to the one discussed in [14]. John and Mary buy a lawnmower. stolen the day before. seen thief go away. John run after him to no avail. All the lawnmowwere too expensive. They couldn&apos;t afford a new one. There are two narrative threads in (3), one describing John and Mary&apos;s visit to a store, the other John&apos;s chase of the thief. These threads correspond to the repeated use of the past and of the past perfect, respectively. The return from the past perfect to the past in also coincides with the return to the earlier thread. Note that (i) not only the simple past but also the past perfect can achieve an effect of continuity and that (ii) more than one discourse reference time needs to be maintained in order to account for the return to an earlier one. The general problem in tense interpretation that we address is how to keep track of all the potential discourse reference times in a context, and how to select the right one for a given anaphoric past tense. We argue that the choice of the discourse anof a temporal operator is subject to ceneffects. assume that each temporal operator in a sentence introduces a discourse reference time into the discourse context. We claim that this set of times constitutes a list of potential discourse reference times for the next sentence, which we&apos;ll later refer to as the temporal forwardlooking center (TCf), and that the position of a temporal operator in the logical form of the sentence affects the choice of the antecedent through parallelism (as a case of the propertyin centering [161). We formalize the effect of surface structure on the choice of temporal antecedent by means of deaxioms. These axioms must be specific than axioms encoding causal reasoning. We argue that the choice of discourse reference time is an instance of a general principle in defeasible reanamely, the Principle that the specific applicable. We support our claims with data from the Brown corpus. In the next section, we review the three existing proposals most related to ours — Webber [27], Lascarides and Oberlander [19], and Hwang and Schubert [14]. The next two sections present a review of centering followed by a discussion of the analogous effects of temporal centering. To account for temporal centering effects, we then present our tense rules and our account of how commonsense reasoning interacts with the default preferences generated by the surface structure. Related Work Webber [27] argues that temporal entities are subject to focusing processes analogous to those constraining the interpretation of definite noun phrases. She explicitly rejects, however, a more direct analogy to Sidner&apos;s [26] potential local foci, and assumes only one temporal referent in the focus Lascarides and Oberlander [19] present defeasible reasoning rules for narrative understanding that partly address the reasoning and control needs of Webber&apos;s model. For example, they argue that in the case of conflicting inferences regarding the temporal order of two times [e.g., whether follows, or overlaps], the specific interpretation should be preferred. However, they do not address cases such as (2), where there are multiple possible discourse reference times and the choice of one interpretation over the other needs to be accounted for. Hwang and Schubert [14] intend to account for the role played by structural factors in the choice of anaphoric relations among distinct past tenses. They propose the contextual structures trees as a narrative gets interpreted. Tense trees reflect the structural dependencies among the tense and aspect operators in the interpretation of the sentences. The events evoked by a sentence are &amp;quot;appended&amp;quot; to the tree nodes whose positions reflect the structural positions of the corresponding temporal operators in the sentence. Webber [27] and Hwang and Schubert [14] differ markedly regarding the relative weight they assign to commonsense inferences versus surface structure, but both have problems with examples like (2). Neither can readily account for the interpretation assigned to (2c&apos;). Webber assumes that the TF of (2b) is initially ti, but shifts to t3, initiating an embedded segment, has been processed sufficiently to recognize that yields a sensible than TF=t2(=t1). She does not discuss how t3 comes to be considered as a potential TF in this case, much less how to reject t2(=t1). Like Webber, Hwang and Schubert assume that (2c&apos;) requires recognition of an embedded segment, but admittedly they have not resolved the conflict between the need for discourse segment recognition, a task for commonsense reasoning, and the clear separation of tense resolution from commonsense reasoning that they advocate. They also fail to disbetwen the hierarchical structures of sen- 71 tences and discourses in the tense tree. Tense tree thus overcommits in places where the rule should belong to defeasible preferences. Our approach is to formulate the structural preferences for tense resolution as defeasible rules analogous to centering preferences for pronoun resolution. These structural preferences, which are overlooked in Webber&apos;s or Lascarides and Oberlander&apos;s accounts, interact with the commonsense inferences used in tense interpretation. Centering is a refinement of Sidner&apos;s [26] local focusing model. It consists of a set of principles rules for dynamically updating the local atstate in discourse processing. We assume the following general picture of processing. A discourse consists of a seof utterances utti, sentence grammar translates the content of each utterance a (set of) form(s) containing unresolved anaphoric expressions and operators. We call it here a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; formula (h. This logical form is similar, in spirit, to Hwang and [14] formula Alshawi&apos;s [2] logical form, main motivations are to represent that part of the sentence meaning independent from the particular discourse context. This &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; meaning representation acts as a clean interface to the pragmatic processing needed to resolve context-dependent expressions. Utterance interpretation takes place in a context, and outputs an updated context. Part of this dynamic context is the attentional state that represents the salient entities ordered by relative salience. say that each formula defines a transirelation the input attentional state and the output attentional state state contains the of attenwhose most salient subpart is the attention. resolving anaphoric expressions center of attention contains a partially set of centers C fi comthe entities realized in . A member of fi (but need not) be the Cbi, currently most salient entity. Centering has mainly been used to constrain how discourse anaphoric pronouns are processed; the centering rule [9] predicts that realized with a pronoun if Also, and both are realized by definite it is predicted that both will be realwe avoid the complication acknowledged in [11] that the two relevant utterances need not literally be adjacent. a.

John&apos;] Cb-establishment Figure 1: Illustration of Centering ized in a common grammatical role, with subject preferred over non-subject [16] [24]. A number of transition relation types have been distinguished in centering. In this paper, we will use the folfour types: Cb-establishment, In Cb-retention, the same entity is retained the = Cbi 0 NULL. Cbanother member of Cb: Cbi, Cbi (Cbi_i may be NULL). These two are the most relevant to present paper. In Cb-resumption, an old in in the current resumed. In NULL-transition, the output state has no Cb Centering posits a preferretention over establishment. We provisionally assume that establishment is preferred over resumption or NULL-transition. We illustrate centering with Fig. 1, where c and c&apos; are alternative continuations of b. After a., contains two entities, John&apos; and storel. In b., John&apos; is referred to with a subject pronoun, and established as c., because John&apos; is the current Cb, and because retention is preferred over establishment, centering predicts that a subject pronoun will refer to John&apos; rather than to Bill&apos;. The default is overridden in c&apos; and instead, the subject pronoun is inferred to refer to Bill&apos; because it is likely that the perceiver in the first perceptual state, see&apos;, remains the perceiver in the subsequent perceptual state, appear&apos;. and Cb-establishment are due to Kameyama [15] [16]. These two roughly correspond to the three [10] and four [5] transition types proposed elsewhere. Cb-resumption captures Sidner&apos;s [26] use of a discourse focus stack in the potential focus list, and can be analogously formalized as a Cb stack within the Cf. NULL-transition has been implicit in Kameyama&apos;s work but has not been made an explicit transition type. 72 a. John went over (ti) to Mary&apos;s house. b.

He picked out (t4&apos;) 5 red ones, 3 white ones, and 1 pale pink. TCbestablishment Figure 2: Illustration of Temporal Centering Centering effects in tense interpretation Our proposal is motivated by the parallel between example (2) above and the centering example in Fig. 1. As illustrated in Figure 2, we would like to say that utterances (2a) and (2b) share the same discourse reference time rl that links t2 to ti. The shared discourse reference time rl is thereby established as a backward-looking temporal center (TCb). (2c) retains the TCb, linking t4 to t2(=t1), whereas (2c&apos;) establishes a new TCb, linking t4&apos; to t3. In order to establish a direct analogy between centering and temporal centering, however, we need to first clarify the nature of the temporal entities in the attentional state. Note that if (2c) retains the &amp;quot;same&amp;quot; TCb, this TCb cannot be identified with either t2 of (2h) or t4 of (2c), since t2 and t4 are distinct (t1=t2, ti t4). The TCb remains fixed while the event times within it may move forward or backward. The TCb is then quite from the time used in proposals inspired by Reichenbach [25] such as Dowty&apos;s and Hinrichs Recall the extended flashback example (3) above. There are two simultaneous narrative threads, in the simple past and in the past perfect, and the former seems to remain somehow in the background while the latter is in the foreground. These examples seem to indicate that when processing a text a reader maintains a list of &amp;quot;potential foci&amp;quot; ordered by their relative salience, instead only one temporal focus, as in Webber&apos;s account. Further evidence in favor of the analogy was by examining a random sample of disproposal is made Kamp and Reyle [17], where they argue for the separation of the tempoint (TPpt) is relatively fixed the reference (Rpt) moves with narrative progression. course sequences from the Brown corpus [8], a heterogeneous corpus that should yield unbiased data. Each multi-sentence sequence contained of two types of sentences multiple temporal operators — the past perfect matrix clause or the past matrix verb taking an embedded past or past perfect complement clause (e.g., John remembered that Mary had asked for roses). We observed that this trigger&apos;s output TCb was almost always the time associated with the superordinate operator. Following each trigger was a sentence a simple past matrix clause. This creates a sequence analogous to (2b-c) or (2b-c&apos;). We analyzed each sequence to determine whether the discourse reference time for the past in the target sentence was introduced by the trigger&apos;s superordinate operator (as a case of TCbretention) or by a subordinate operator (as a case of TCb-establishment). In the total of 80 examples, we found 52 retentions (65%) and 12 establishments 15%). Others included 9 cases of &amp;quot;neicombination of resumption and NULL-transition) and 7 undecidable cases (9%). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that in a sentence with multiple temporal operators, the relative likelihood that a given temporal operator provides the discourse reference time for a subsequent past depends on its syntactic prominence. The question is, how do temporal centering and commonsense reasoning interact to yield the observed results? Two levels of logical representation Our explanation for the interaction between temporal centering and commonsense reasoning rests on assuming two distinct levels of representation sentence interpretation. One is the form independent from the context and obtained by a direct translation of the surface syntactic structure of the utterance. The other is a fully resolved logical expression that results from incrementally resolving context-dependent expressions in the logical form. For simplicity, our discussion ignores anything but temporal operators. Much as in Hwang and Schubert&apos;s proposal [14], the logical form contains unresolved temporal operators — e.g., tense operators, PRES(ent) aspectual operators, PERF(ect) and PROG(ressive). It also represents the structural position of the temporal operators in a sentence. The crucial difference is that we take each tense and operator to also give rise to a refinterval below) that is contextually resolved. Our logical forms for (2a) and (2b) are shown in (4). &apos;John goes over to Mary&apos;s house&apos;) 73 e (e C r) starts_before SuperNow) (LastIn(r) orients e) r()]) e (e C r) starts_before SuperRef) (LastIn(r) orients e) = Figure 3: Mapping rules for PAST and PERF &apos;John stops by the florist for some roses&apos;)) The temporal operators in our logical forms are translated into the language of what we call the structure representation (ESR). essence, ESR represents the temporal and causal relations among the eventualities described in discourse. We will use Allen&apos;s [1] interval representation scheme for this representation level. Described correspond to intervals what we have been calling the &amp;quot;discourse reference correspond to reference intervals. To represent relations among these temporal intervals, we use disjunctive subsets of Allen&apos;s thirteen relations. With Allen&apos;s representation, we can directly represent vague or ambiguous temporal relations expressed in natural language and incrementally resolve them to more specific relations using constraint propagation. Our discourse reference intervals coincide exactly with the computational of Allen&apos;s intervals. Tense mapping rules we define the recursive mapping between the logical form and the event structure These tense mapping rules &amp;quot;unpack&amp;quot; the relations among relevant event intervals and discourse reference intervals encoded by temporal operators in the logical form, and generate the initial event structure representation. Although these rules look similar to Hwang and Schubert&apos;s tense deindexing rules, they play a very different role. Rather than performing sentence interpretation, as their deindexing rules do, our mapping rules specify the semantics of the logical form in terms of the event structure representa- The for shown in Fig. 3.

We assume that there is an updating mechanism for SuperNow defined for each utterance initiation including the of a quoted speech. to the event interval evoked by the temporal operator that immediately dominates the current one in the logical form. disjunction of meets, precedes and the inverse of finishes (m -.&lt; fi), is possible relation between between any of the aspectual type of 0. from Hwang and Schubert, is the disjunctive set of all of Allen&apos;s thirteen relations.

[6] [12]). a function defined over discourse reference intervals, and evaluates to the recent interval in the discourse reference interval r, where applicable. This event interval orients the new event interval e. LastIn(r) corresponds to the &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot; that moves with narrative progression in approaches like Dowty [6] and Hinrichs [12]. How the mapping rules work Table 1 shows the logical form and the event structure determined by the mapping rules for each sentence of (2) (repeated here). (5)a.

SuperRef to event inof the dominating yielding starts_before t2, is then specialized t2 to the aspectual types of PERF/3 The interaction between structural factors and causal knowledge We propose that defeasible rules producing hypotheses about the interpretation of an utterance operate on both the levels of representation used in tense interpretation. On the event structure representation level, we assume the existence of axioms formalizing lexical semantics and other aspects of commonsense knowledge (e.g., [13] [19]), call them axioms. examples are given in (6) and (7) below. We use the default conditional &gt; introduced by Asher and Morreau [3] and used by Lascarides and Oberlander [19]. (6) encodes the inference that people usually pick up flowers at the florist&apos;s. (7) say that people are usually at certain places as a result of their going there. (6) PICK-UP(X,flowers,t) &gt; (AT(X,florist,t&apos;) A tCt&apos;) (7) AT(X,place,t) &gt; (Go-To(X,place,t&apos;) A t&apos;-&lt;t) The other, more novel, assumption we make is that there are defeasible rules that operate on the logical form, on the basis of structural information only. We formalize the effects of structural in terms of what we call form as in the case of axioms formalizing commonsense knowledge, logical form axioms can be defeasible. Although the effects of structural factors on anaphora interpretation are widely acknowledged in linguistic theories (e.g., binding theory), the interest is more on indefeasible grammatical principles. Our logical form axioms encode grammatically derived defeasible preferences, the kind of structural effects that centering and temporal centering uncover. We assume the following architecture for sentence interpretation. Once the logical form has been obtained, logical form reasoning takes place. There are two kinds of rules in logical form reasoning — monotonic (or indefeasible) and defeasible. The former rewrite the logical form, and the latgenerate form hypotheses, are additional logical form expressions. All of the hypotheses resulting from logical form reasoning, as well as the original interpretation, are then mapped into event structure representations, and causal axioms are used to complete the interpretation. All complete interpretations of a sentence are compared to find the best hypothesis. We propose to encode temporal centering as defeasible logical form axioms that generate logical form hypotheses about the interpretations of unresolved discourse reference intervals. To be more precise, we claim that the following principle holds: Property-sharing Principle Resolve the current discourse reference interval a discourse reference interval ri in the state. By default, ri should the same the temporal position in the logical form. This general preference can be encoded by means of logical form axioms of the type shown in (8), whose intended interpretation is as follows Let and be two consecutive utin discourse, (utt) a function from to their logical forms, (D) be subformula of T) be of pos (if 1.4f 2) be a function from pairs of a formula lfl and a subformula 1f2 into the &amp;quot;temporal position&amp;quot; of 1f2 in The position a subformula in a is the sequence of operof the subformula. For example, in the foreC r Constraint a PAST a PAST (PERF/3) PERF # PAST -y PAST 7&apos; ti C rl t2 C r2 t3 C r3 t4 C r4 t4&apos;C r4&apos; ti (m fi) t3 t2 t4 u, t4&apos;(-0 75 (PAST (PERF temporal position (PAST (PERE the empty sequence 0, of (PERE the sequence (PAST), and that of 0 is the sequence (PAST,PERF). In a case (I)) = pos(un, (PASTr2 ‘II)), the TPP generates the hypothesis that the two discourse reference intervals r1 and r2 are the same. ,uttn ) = pos (lf , (PAST,.2 ) : A similar rule generates hypotheses about the identity of two discourse reference intervals both by in the same temporal positions. and Oberlander the Principle a way of choosing among conflicts generated by the application of defeasible rules. The principle says that whenever a conflict between rules arises, the hypothesis obtained by the specific should be chosen. The logical form axioms encode general knowledge of linguistic structures independent from particular events or situations being described. Thus the they encode is necessarily specific than rules encoding lexical inferences and causal relations. Hence the following consequences on the TPP: The TPP applies in the absence of information about causal relation between the events. Any hypothesis that results from causal reasoning is preferred over the hypothesis suggested by the TPP. This general pattern of interaction between causal and logical form axioms predicts the following Temporal Centering Principle: Centering Principle cbi evokes a set of unresolved discourse reference each resolved against current atttentional state as follows — (i) causal axioms generate a hypothesis, take it, (ii) IF TPP generates a hypothesis, take (iii) are new to the discourse. resolution, are in the in the context of Case (i) of the TCP allows any of the four transition types, retention, establishment, resumption, or NULL. A NULL-transition only result only from negative conclusions obtained from causal axioms. Under the TPP in the form of rule (8) that applies only on consecutive utterances, case (ii) would result in either TCb-retention or TCb-establishment, but not TCb-resumption. How does this accord with our corpus data discussed earlier? In the most frequent (65%) TCbretention, the discourse reference interval evoked by the matrix past tense is identified with another evoked by the matrix past tense in the previous utterance. In the next frequent (15%) TCbestablishment, it is identified with the one evoked by the subordinate temporal operator. This sharp difference in frequency would be explained by the fact that the TPP supports the former but not the latter. Webber&apos;s example, revisited. We now go back to Webber&apos;s example (2) and explain how the interactions of defeasible rules result in the temporal centering transitions shown in Fig. 2. The input consists of the logical forms from Table 1. (2a) For the initial sentence of discourse, only the can apply. is identified, remains as an open variable. contains The TPP can apply for in with r1=.--r2. As a TCb2=r1, and the value of LastIn(r2)=LastIn(r1) is t1. This yields ti orients t2, where t1 is the transition event for (a) and t2, for a state a non-stative event interval event interval, the former is covby starts, finishes, equals, during, or their inverses) the latter by default. (2c) The TPP, in the form of rule (8), generates the hypothesis expressed by the following logform: &apos;The roses fail to her&apos;). causal reasoning generates same conclusion, namely, order to give somebody flowers, one has to be at somebody&apos;s we conclude that the &apos;failing-to-cheer event&apos; continues the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of John&apos;s going over to Mary&apos;s house. Either way, we have a yielding =[r1(=r4)] and The value of LastIn(r4) is now orients t4. t1 and event intervals for transition events (a and 7), to ti t4. There is a conflict. While TPP would suggest a continuation of the story of John&apos;s visit at Mary&apos;s house, the causal rules such as (6) suggest that the event of picking up flowers takes place at the florist&apos;s, and the rules such as (7) suggest that being at the florist&apos;s results from the action of &amp;quot;stopping by&amp;quot; the florist&apos;s. The Penguin Principle now applies, resulting in TCb-establishment, and t3 t4. 76 Conclusions We have presented a semantic and pragmatic account of the past tense that uniformly accounts for its discourse anaphoric properties. We distinguish between two kinds of intervals, discourse reference intervals and event intervals, which allows us to provide a direct analogy between centering and temporal centering. We introduce the notion of logical form reasoning, which obviates the need for tense trees as the source for structural reasoning, and, at the same time, enables us to account for the interaction between the structural preferences and causal reasoning. By including in both logical form expressions and event structure representation an explicit indication of the contextual parameters to be resolved, rules can be formulated that exploit the kind of information available at each level. We can therefore factor out different sources of defeasible preferences in tense interpretation. Rules operating on the logical form formalize the effects of structural factors, and rules operating on the event structure formalize the effects of commonsense knowledge. The ordering preferences in our Model are consistent with data from a large, heterogeneous corpus. In the future work, we need to develop an evaluation method for our model, to specify more fully the knowledge representation and reasoning needs, and finally to clarify consequences that our model might have on a more unified model of attentional state to simultaneously account for nominal and temporal anaphora.

The supporting observation is that in two consecutive past tense descriptions of events, as in (1) below (from [181), the second sentence refers to a time (V) whose identity depends on the time (t) of the event described in the first sentence. (1)a. The Lone Ranger got on his horse. (t) b. He rode off into the sunset. (V) Tense interpretation also involves commonsense inferences in that the specific relation between the two event times may vary. In (1), the relation inferred to hold is temporal progression (t t&apos;), but other ordering relations are also possible (see [6] [27]). Any temporal relations are in fact possible for two consecutively described events in discourse. A number of factors affect the interpretation as to whether successive past tenses are anaphorically related, and if they are, what the relative order of the associated events is. The determinant factors have been argued to be discourse structure ([27] [14]), aspectual type ([6] [12] [17]), surface structure ([71 [14]), and commonsense knowledge ([19] [27] [13]).

Thus, as noted by Webber [27], a past perfect evokes two temporal referents (e.g., t2 and t3) and either of them can provide a discourse reference time for a subsequent past tense. 1Later we will see that although the first tense generates a discourse reference time for the subsequent one, its temporal referent (here ti) is not precisely equivalent to it. 70 Another aspect of the problem in tense interpretation is illustrated with so-called extended flashbacks such as Example (3), similar to the one discussed in [14]. (3) John and Mary went to buy a lawnmower. Somebody had stolen theirs the day before. They had seen the thief go away. John had run after him to no avail. All the lawnmowers were too expensive. They decided they couldn&apos;t afford a new one. There are two narrative threads in (3), one describing John and Mary&apos;s visit to a store, the other John&apos;s chase of the thief. These threads correspond to the repeated use of the past and of the past perfect, respectively. The return from the past perfect to the past in also coincides with the return to the earlier thread.

We formalize the effect of surface structure on the choice of temporal antecedent by means of defeasible axioms. These axioms must be less specific than axioms encoding causal reasoning. We argue that the choice of discourse reference time is an instance of a general principle in defeasible reasoning, namely, the Penguin Principle [19] that chooses the most specific axiom applicable. We support our claims with data from the Brown corpus. In the next section, we review the three existing proposals most related to ours — Webber [27], Lascarides and Oberlander [19], and Hwang and Schubert [14]. The next two sections present a review of centering followed by a discussion of the analogous effects of temporal centering. To account for temporal centering effects, we then present our tense rules and our account of how commonsense reasoning interacts with the default preferences generated by the surface structure. Related Work Webber [27] argues that temporal entities are subject to focusing processes analogous to those constraining the interpretation of definite noun phrases. She explicitly rejects, however, a more direct analogy to Sidner&apos;s [26] potential local foci, and assumes only o</context>

Lascarides and Oberlander [19] present defeasible reasoning rules for narrative understanding that partly address the reasoning and control needs of Webber&apos;s model. For example, they argue that in the case of conflicting inferences regarding the temporal order of two times [e.g., whether precedes, follows, or overlaps], the most specific interpretation should be preferred. However, they do not address cases such as (2), where there are multiple possible discourse reference times and the choice of one interpretation over the other needs to be accounted for. Hwang and Schubert [14] intend to account for the role played by structural factors in the choice of anaphoric relations among distinct past tenses. They propose the contextual structures called tense trees built as a narrative gets interpreted. Tense trees reflect the structural dependencies among the tense and aspect operators in the interpretation of the sentences. The events evoked by a sentence are &amp;quot;appended&amp;quot; to the tree nodes whose positions reflect the structural positions of the corresponding temporal operators in the sentence.

One is the logical form independent from the context and obtained by a direct translation of the surface syntactic structure of the utterance. The other is a fully resolved logical expression that results from incrementally resolving context-dependent expressions in the logical form. For simplicity, our discussion ignores anything but temporal operators. Much as in Hwang and Schubert&apos;s proposal [14], the logical form contains unresolved temporal operators — e.g., tense operators, PRES(ent) and PAST, and aspectual operators, PERF(ect) and PROG(ressive). It also represents the structural position of the temporal operators in a sentence. The crucial difference is that we take each tense and aspect operator to also give rise to a discourse reference interval (see below) that is contextually resolved.

We formalize the effect of surface structure on the choice of temporal antecedent by means of defeasible axioms. These axioms must be less specific than axioms encoding causal reasoning. We argue that the choice of discourse reference time is an instance of a general principle in defeasible reasoning, namely, the Penguin Principle [19] that chooses the most specific axiom applicable. We support our claims with data from the Brown corpus. In the next section, we review the three existing proposals most related to ours — Webber [27], Lascarides and Oberlander [19], and Hwang and Schubert [14]. The next two sections present a review of centering followed by a discussion of the analogous effects of temporal centering. To account for temporal centering effects, we then present our tense rules and our account of how commonsense reasoning interacts with the default preferences generated by the surface structure.

Lascarides and Oberlander [19] present defeasible reasoning rules for narrative understanding that partly address the reasoning and control needs of Webber&apos;s model. For example, they argue that in the case of conflicting inferences regarding the temporal order of two times [e.g., whether precedes, follows, or overlaps], the most specific interpretation should be preferred.

Our approach is to formulate the structural preferences for tense resolution as defeasible rules analogous to centering preferences for pronoun resolution. These structural preferences, which are overlooked in Webber&apos;s or Lascarides and Oberlander&apos;s accounts, interact with the commonsense inferences used in tense interpretation. Centering Centering [9] is a refinement of Sidner&apos;s [26] local focusing model. It consists of a set of principles and rules for dynamically updating the local attentional state [11] in discourse processing. We assume the following general picture of discourse processing. A discourse consists of a sequence of utterances utti, uttn. The sentence grammar translates the content of each utterance utti into a (set of) surface logical form(s) containing unresolved anaphoric expressions and operators. We call it here a &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; formula (h. This logical form is similar, in spirit, to Hwang and Schubert&apos;s [14] indexical formula and Alshawi&apos;s [2] quasi logic</context>

These two roughly correspond to the three [10] and four [5] transition types proposed elsewhere.

This distinction makes it possible to develop an analogy between centering and temporal centering, which operates on discourse reference intervals. Our temporal propertysharing principle is a defeasible inference rule on the logical form. Along with lexical and causal reasoning, it plays a role in incrementally resolving underspecified aspects of the event structure representation of an utterance against the current context. The Problem The past tense has been compared with anaphoric definite pronouns ([20] [22]) and definite noun phrases ([27]). The supporting observation is that in two consecutive past tense descriptions of events, as in (1) below (from [181), the second sentence refers to a time (V) whose identity depends on the time (t) of the event described in the first sentence. (1)a. The Lone Ranger got on his horse. (t) b. He rode off into the sunset. (V) Tense interpretation also involves commonsense inferences in that the specific relation between the two event times may vary. In (1), the relation inferred to hold is temporal progression (t t&apos;), but other ordering relations are also possible (see [6] [27]). Any temporal r</context>

A number of factors affect the interpretation as to whether successive past tenses are anaphorically related, and if they are, what the relative order of the associated events is. The determinant factors have been argued to be discourse structure ([27] [14]), aspectual type ([6] [12] [17]), surface structure ([71 [14]), and commonsense knowledge ([19] [27] [13]). However, no account has adequately addressed all four factors. The problem in tense interpretation that we address is illustrated with Example (2) (from [27]). (2)a. John went over (ti) to Mary&apos;s house. b. On the way, he had (t2) stopped (t3) by the flower shop for some roses. (t3 t2 (=--t1)) c. Unfortunately, they failed (t4) to cheer her up. (t3 ti t4) c&apos;. He picked out (t4&apos;) 5 red ones, 3 white ones and 1 pale pink. (t3 t4&apos; ti) (2c) and (2c&apos;) are alternative third sentences. Although both are in the simple past, and both evoke events of the same aspectual type (transition event [23]), they are interpreted differently. We refer to the contextually established time that a past tense is resolved against as the &amp;quot;discourse reference time.&amp;quot; A discour</context>

We formalize the effect of surface structure on the choice of temporal antecedent by means of defeasible axioms. These axioms must be less specific than axioms encoding causal reasoning. We argue that the choice of discourse reference time is an instance of a general principle in defeasible reasoning, namely, the Penguin Principle [19] that chooses the most specific axiom applicable. We support our claims with data from the Brown corpus. In the next section, we review the three existing proposals most related to ours — Webber [27], Lascarides and Oberlander [19], and Hwang and Schubert [14]. The next two sections present a review of centering followed by a discussion of the analogous effects of temporal centering. To account for temporal centering effects, we then present our tense rules and our account of how commonsense reasoning interacts with the default preferences generated by the surface structure. Related Work Webber [27] argues that temporal entities are subject to focusing processes analogous to those constraining the interpretation of definite noun phrases. She explicitly rejects, however, a more direct anal</context>

Hwang and Schubert [14] intend to account for the role played by structural factors in the choice of anaphoric relations among distinct past tenses. They propose the contextual structures called tense trees built as a narrative gets interpreted. Tense trees reflect the structural dependencies among the tense and aspect operators in the interpretation of the sentences. The events evoked by a sentence are &amp;quot;appended&amp;quot; to the tree nodes whose positions reflect the structural positions of the corresponding temporal operators in the sentence. Webber [27] and Hwang and Schubert [14] differ markedly regarding the relative weight they assign to commonsense inferences versus surface structure, but both have problems with examples like (2). Neither can readily account for the interpretation assigned to (2c&apos;). Webber assumes that the TF of (2b) is initially ti, but shifts to t3, thus initiating an embedded segment, after (2c&apos;) has been processed sufficiently to recognize that TF=t3 yields a more sensible interpretation than TF=t2(=t1). She does not discuss how t3 comes to be considered as a potential TF in this case, much less how to reject t2(=t1)</context>
