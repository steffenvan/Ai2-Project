Little research has been done to explore
differences in the interactional aspects of
dialogue between children with Autis-
tic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and those
with typical development (TD). Quantify-
ing the differences could aid in diagnosing
ASD, understanding its nature, and better
understanding the mechanisms of dialogue
processing. In this paper, we report on a
study of dialogues with children with ASD
and TD. We find that the two groups differ
substantially in how long they pause be-
fore speaking, and their use of fillers, ac-
knowledgments, and discourse markers.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999748466666667">
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) form a group
of severe neuropsychiatric conditions whose fea-
tures can include impairments in reciprocal social
interaction and in communication (APA, 2000).
These impairments may take different forms,
ranging from individuals with little or no com-
munication to fully verbal individuals with fluent,
grammatically correct speech. In this latter verbal
group, shortcomings in communication have been
noted, including using and processing social cues
during conversations. This is no surprise, since
negotiating a conversation requires many abilities,
several of which are generally impaired in ASD,
such as generating appropriate prosody (Kanner,
1943) and “theory of mind” (Baron-Cohen, 2000).
We make a distinction between transactional
and interactional aspects of dialogue (Brown and
Yule, 1983). The transactional aspect refers to
message content and interactional focuses on ex-
pressing social relations and personal attitudes.
In this paper, we focus on surface behaviors
that speakers use to help manage the interaction,
namely turn-taking, and the use of fillers, dis-
course markers, and acknowledgments. One ad-
vantage of these behaviors is that they do not re-
quire complete understanding of the dialogue, and
thus lend themselves to automatic analysis. In
addition, these behaviors are under the speaker’s
control and should be robust to what the other
speaker is doing. We hypothesize that just as in-
teractional aspects in general are affected in ASD,
so are these surface behaviors. However, to our
knowledge, little or no work has been done on this.
Investigating how the interactional aspects of
dialogue are affected in ASD serves several pur-
poses. First, it can help in the diagnostic process.
Currently, diagnosing ASD is subjective. Objec-
tive measures based on dialogue interaction could
improve the reliability of the diagnostic process.
Second, it can help us refine the behavioral phe-
notypes of ASD, which is critical for progress on
the basic science front. Third, it can help us re-
fine therapy for people with ASD to address di-
alogue interaction deficits. Fourth, understand-
ing what dialogue aspects are affected in high-
functioning verbal children with ASD can help de-
termine which aspects of dialogue are primarily
social in nature. For example, do speakers use
fillers to signal that there is a communication prob-
lem, or are fillers a symptom of it (cf. Clark and
Fox Tree, 2002)?
In this paper, we report on a study of interac-
tional aspects of dialogues between clinicians and
children with ASD. The dialogues were recorded
during administration of the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2000), which
is an instrument used to assist in diagnosing ASD.
We compare the performance of these children
with a group of children with typical development
(TD).

The data used in this paper was collected dur-
ing administration of the ADOS on 22 TD chil-
dren and 26 with ASD, ranging in age from 4 to
8 years old. The children with ASD were high-
functioning and verbal. The speech of the clini-
cian and child was transcribed into utterance-like
units, with a start and an end time. Activities were
annotated in a separate tier. The transcriptions in-
cluded the punctuation marks ‘.’, ‘!’, and ‘?’ to

Pauses between Turns: We first examine how
long children wait before starting their turn. We
hypothesized that children with ASD would wait
longer on average to respond, either because they
are less aware of (a) the turn-taking cues, (b) the
social obligation to minimize inter-turn pauses, or
(c) they have a slower processing and response
times. For this analysis, we look at all turns in
which there is no overlap between the beginning of
the child’s turn and the clinician’s speech. Data is
available on 4412 pauses for the TD children and
5676 for the children with ASD. The grand means
of the children’s pauses are shown in Table 1 along
with the standard deviations. The TD children’s
average pause length is 0.876s. For the children
with ASD, it is 1.115s, 27.3% longer. This dif-
ference is significant, a-priori independent t-test
t=2.34 (df=39), p&lt;.02 one-tailed.

<bodyText confidence="0.999399172413793">
We also examine the pauses following ques-
tions by the clinician versus non-questions. Ques-
tions are interesting as they impose a social obli-
gation for the child to respond, and they have
strong prosodic cues at their ending. We identified
questions as utterances transcribed with a ques-
tion mark, which might include rhetorical ques-
tions. After a non-question (e.g., a statement), the
average pause is 1.076s for the TD children and
1.329s for children with ASD. This difference is
not statistically significant by independent t-test,
t&lt;1.6, NS. After a question, the average pause
is 0.748s for the TD children and 1.005s for the
children with ASD, a significant difference by a-
priori independent t-test t=2.72 (df=42), p&lt;.005
one-tailed. The ASD children on average take
34.4% longer to respond. Thus, after a question,
the difference between children with TD and ASD
is more pronounced.
Pauses by Activity: The ADOS includes hav-
ing the child engage in different activities. For
this research, we collapse the activities into three
types: converse is when there is no non-speech
task; describe is when the child is doing a men-
tal task, such as describing a picture; and play is
when the child is interacting with the clinician in
a play session. To better understand the difference
between questions and non-questions, we examine
the pauses in each activity (Table 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.999951631578947">
After a question, the TD children tend to re-
spond with similar pauses in each activity (the dif-
ferences in column 2 between activities are not
significant by pairwise paired t-test, all t’s&lt;1.6,
NS). After a question, the child has a social obli-
gation to respond, and this does not seem to be
overridden by whether there is a separate task
they are involved in. Even after a non-question,
conversants have a social obligation to keep the
speaking floor occupied and so to minimize inter-
utterance pauses (Sacks et al., 1974). However, as
seen in the third column, the pauses are affected
by the type of activity, and the differences are
statistically significant by pairwise paired t-test,
(df=21), two-tailed: converse-describe t=2.24,
p&lt;.04; describe-play t=5.68, p&lt;.0001; converse-
play t=6.87, p&lt;.0001. The biggest difference is
with play. Here, it seems that the conversants
physical interaction lessens the social obligation
of maintaining the speaking floor. These findings
are interesting for social-linguistics as it suggests
that the social obligations of turn-taking are al-
tered by the presence of a non-speech task.
We next compare the children with ASD to the
TD children. For the converse activity, we see that
the children with ASD take longer to respond, af-
ter questions and non-questions. The difference
after questions is significant by independent t-test,
t=1.74 (df=46) p&lt;.05, one-tailed, whereas the dif-
ference after non-questions is marginal, t=1.47
(df=28) p&lt;.08. This result could be explained by
the slower processing and response times associ-
ated with ASD.
Just as with the TD children, we see that after
a non-question, the children with ASD take longer
to respond when there is another task. The differ-
ences in pause lengths between converse and play
are significant, by paired t-test, t=2.89 (df=23)

p&lt;.009, two-tailed. The difference between de-
scribe and play is marginal, t=2.03 (df=25) p&lt;.06,
and there was no significant difference between
converse and describe, t&lt;1, NS.
After a question, the children with ASD take
longer to respond when there is another task, espe-
cially for play, although the pairwise differences in
pause length between activities are not significant.
This suggests that the children with ASD become
distracted when there is another task, and so be-
come less sensitive to either the question prosody
or the social obligation of questions.
Fillers: We next examine the rate of fillers, at
the beginning of turns, beginning of utterances,
and in the middle of utterances. We look at these
contexts individually as fillers can serve different
roles, such as turn-taking, stalling for time or as
part of a disfluency, and their role is correlated
to their position in a turn. The rates are reported
in Table 3, along with the total number of fillers
within each category. Interestingly, the rate of ‘uh’
between children with TD and ASD is similar for
all positions (independent t-test, all g’s&lt;1, NS).

The more interesting finding, though, is in the

cantly less than the TD children in every position,

<bodyText confidence="0.999816970588236">
We also examined the overall usage of ‘um’ in
each activity (Table 4). The TD children use ‘um’
more often in each activity than the children with
ASD, and the differences are statistically signif-
icant by independent two-tailed t-test: converse
t=3.62 (df=29), p&lt;.002; describe t=2.83 (df=27),
p&lt;.01; play t=2.42 (df=33), p&lt;.03. This result
supports the robustness of the findings about ‘um’.
Many researchers have speculated on the role
of ‘um’ and ‘uh’. In recent work, Clark and Fox
Tree (2002) argued that they signal a delay, and
that ‘um’ signals more delay than ‘uh’. They view
both as linguistic devices that are planned for, just
as any other word is. Our work suggests that ‘um’
and ‘uh’ arise from different cognitive processes,
and that the process that accounts for ‘uh’ is not
affected by ASD, while the process for ‘um’ is.1
Acknowledgments: We next look at the rate of
acknowledgments: single word utterances that are
used to show agreement or understanding. Thus,
the use of acknowledgments requires awareness of
the other person’s desire to ensure mutual under-
standing. As the corpus did not have these words
explicitly marked, we identify a word as an ac-
knowledgment if it meets the following criteria:
(a) it is one of the words listed in Table 5 (based
on Heeman and Allen, 1999); (b) it is first in the
speaker’s turn; and (c) it does not follow a question
by the clinician. The TD children used acknowl-
edgments in 17.42% of their turns that did not fol-
low a question, while the children with ASD did
this only 13.39% of the time (Table 5), a statis-
tically significant difference by a-priori indepen-
dent t-test t=1.78 (df=46), p&lt;.05 one-tailed.

Discourse Markers: We next examine dis-
course markers, which are words such as ‘well’
and ‘oh’ that express how the current utterance
relates to the discourse context (Schiffrin, 1987).
We classified a word as a discourse marker if it
was the first word in an utterance and is one of
the words in Table 6 (Heeman and Allen, 1999).
As shown in Table 6, the children with ASD use
discourse markers significantly less than the TD
children in both conditions by a-priori indepen-
dent, one-tailed t-test: turn-initial t=3.24 (df=43)
p&lt;.002; utterance-initial t=4.01 (df=44) p&lt;.0001.

As can be seen, most of the difference is in the use
of ‘and’. The data for the other discourse markers
was sparse, so we compared ‘and’ against all of the
others combined. The decreased usage of ‘and’
in the ASD children is statistically significant
for both conditions by a-priori independent, one-
tailed t-test: turn-initial t=4.47 (df=30), p&lt;.0001;
utterance-initial t=3.79 (df=43), p&lt;.0002. There
is little difference in the use of all of the other dis-
course markers combined, and the difference is not
statistically significant.

One explanation for the decreased usage of
‘and’ and not the other discourse markers might
be that, of all the discourse markers, ‘and’ seems
to have the least meaning. It simply signifies
that there is some continuation between the new
speech and the previous context. This might make
it difficult for children with ASD to learn its use. A
second explanation is that the children with ASD
are using ‘and’ correctly, but simply do not pro-
duce as many utterances that are related to the pre-
vious context (cf. Bishop et al., 2000).

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998465">
In this paper, we examined a number of interac-
tional aspects of dialogue in the speech of children
with ASD and TD. We found that children with
ASD have a lower rate of the filler ‘um’, acknowl-
edgments, and the discourse marker ‘and.’ We also
found that in certain situations, they take longer to
respond. These deficits might prove useful for im-
proved diagnosis of ASD. We also found that chil-
dren with ASD have a lower rate of ‘um’ but not
of ‘uh’, and that only the discourse marker ‘and’
seems to be affected. This might prove useful for
both better understanding the nature of ASD as
well as better understanding the role of these phe-
nomena in dialogue. Although the results reported
in this work are preliminary, they do show the po-
tential of our approach. More work is needed to
ensure that our automatic identification of turn-
taking events, discourse markers, and acknowl-
edgments is correct and to explore alternate expla-
nations for the results that we observed.

These impairments may take different forms, ranging from individuals with little or no communication to fully verbal individuals with fluent, grammatically correct speech. In this latter verbal group, shortcomings in communication have been noted, including using and processing social cues during conversations. This is no surprise, since negotiating a conversation requires many abilities, several of which are generally impaired in ASD, such as generating appropriate prosody (Kanner, 1943) and “theory of mind” (Baron-Cohen, 2000). We make a distinction between transactional and interactional aspects of dialogue (Brown and Yule, 1983). The transactional aspect refers to message content and interactional focuses on expressing social relations and personal attitudes. In this paper, we focus on surface behaviors that speakers use to help manage the interaction, namely turn-taking, and the use of fillers, discourse markers, and acknowledgments. One advantage of these behaviors is that they do not require complete understanding of the dialogue, and thus lend themselves to automatic analysis. In addition, these behaviors are</context>

Thus, the use of acknowledgments requires awareness of the other person’s desire to ensure mutual understanding. As the corpus did not have these words explicitly marked, we identify a word as an acknowledgment if it meets the following criteria: (a) it is one of the words listed in Table 5 (based on Heeman and Allen, 1999); (b) it is first in the speaker’s turn; and (c) it does not follow a question by the clinician. The TD children used acknowledgments in 17.42% of their turns that did not follow a question, while the children with ASD did this only 13.39% of the time (Table 5), a statistically significant difference by a-priori independent t-test t=1.78 (df=46), p&lt;.05 one-tailed.

After a question, the TD children tend to respond with similar pauses in each activity (the differences in column 2 between activities are not significant by pairwise paired t-test, all t’s&lt;1.6, NS). After a question, the child has a social obligation to respond, and this does not seem to be overridden by whether there is a separate task they are involved in. Even after a non-question, conversants have a social obligation to keep the speaking floor occupied and so to minimize interutterance pauses (Sacks et al., 1974). However, as seen in the third column, the pauses are affected by the type of activity, and the differences are statistically significant by pairwise paired t-test, (df=21), two-tailed: converse-describe t=2.24, p&lt;.04; describe-play t=5.68, p&lt;.0001; converseplay t=6.87, p&lt;.0001. The biggest difference is with play. Here, it seems that the conversants physical interaction lessens the social obligation of maintaining the speaking floor. These findings are interesting for social-linguistics as it suggests that the social obligations of turn-taking are altered by the presence of a non-speech task</context>

Discourse Markers: We next examine discourse markers, which are words such as ‘well’ and ‘oh’ that express how the current utterance relates to the discourse context (Schiffrin, 1987). We classified a word as a discourse marker if it was the first word in an utterance and is one of the words in Table 6 (Heeman and Allen, 1999). As shown in Table 6, the children with ASD use discourse markers significantly less than the TD children in both conditions by a-priori independent, one-tailed t-test: turn-initial t=3.24 (df=43) p&lt;.002; utterance-initial t=4.01 (df=44) p&lt;.0001. 1In Lunsford et al.
