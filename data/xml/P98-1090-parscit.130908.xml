Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994210625">
Our corpus of descriptive text contains a signifi-
cant number of long-distance pronominal references
(8.4% of the total). In order to account for how these
pronouns are interpreted, we re-examine Grosz and
Sidner&apos;s theory of the attentional state, and in par-
ticular the use of the global focus to supplement
centering theory. Our corpus evidence concerning
these long-distance pronominal references, as well
as studies of the use of descriptions, proper names
and ambiguous uses of pronouns, lead us to con-
clude that a discourse focus stack mechanism of the
type proposed by Sidner is essential to account for
the use of these referring expressions. We suggest
revising the Grosz &amp; Sidner framework by allowing
for the possibility that an entity in a focus space may
have special status.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994116">
We call LONG-DISTANCE PRONOMINALISATIONS
those cases of pronoun use in which the antecedent
of the pronoun does not occur either in the same
sentence as the pronoun or in the immediately pre-
ceding one, but further back in the text. These cases
are thought to be rare on the basis of studies such
as (Hobbs, 1978), which found that 98% of pro-
noun antecedents in the corpus analysed were in the
same sentence as the pronoun or the previous one.
However, our analysis of a small corpus of oral de-
scriptions of museum items collected for the ILEX
project (Hitzeman et al., 1997) revealed that long-
distance pronouns are much more common in this
kind of data —four times as common, in fact: out of
a total of 83 pronouns, 7 (8.4%) were long-distance.
The typical pattern of long-distance pronominalisa-
tion in the ILEX dialogues is shown in (1), where the
pronoun him in the last sentence refers to the jew-
eller, mentioned most recently two sentences ear-
lier.

2. What these symbolise for me are one of the pre-
occupations of the 1980s, which is recycling.
3. The jeweller who made these bangles was par-
ticularly interested in the idea of using intrinsically
worthless material— material that had been thrown
away, old junk— and he lavished on those materials
an incredibly painstaking and time-consuming tech-
nique, so that the amount of time put into the labour
of making these jewels bears absolutely no relation
to the value of the materials that he&apos;s used.
4. And if you look at, for instance, the bangle at the
bottom— that&apos;s the blue and red one— what looks as
though it&apos;s painted decoration is in fact inlaid; it&apos;s

All 7 long-distance pronouns in the ILEX dialogues
we have studied refer to discourse entities intro-
duced in background text in this way.
Unlike Sidner&apos;s theory of focus (Sidner, 1979),
the theory of the attentional state in (Grosz and
Sidner, 1986) (henceforth: G&amp;S) does not include
explicit provision for long-distance pronominalisa-
tions, although some of the necessary tools are po-
tentially already there, as we will see. The compo-
nent of the theory that deals with pronominal ref-
erence, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), only
accounts for cases in which the antecedent of a pro-
noun is introduced by the previous sentence; cases
such as (1) have to be handled by different mech-
anisms. In this paper we look the phenomenon of
long-distance pronominalisation in some detail, ex-
amining data from different domains, and consider

its implications for G&amp;S&apos;s theory.
2 Theories of focus
Space unfortunately prevents a full discussion of
Grosz&apos;s (1977), Sidner&apos;s (1979), and G&amp;S&apos;s (1986)
theories of focus and the attentional state in this
abstract. The crucial aspects of these theories, for
the purpose of the discussion below, are as follows.
First of all, G&amp;S propose a distinction between two
components of the attentional state: the GLOBAL
FOCUS, structured as a stack of focus spaces and ac-
cessed to interpret definite descriptions; and the LO-
CAL FOCUS, consisting of the information preferen-
tially used to interpret pronouns. In addition, they
adopt CENTERING THEORY (Grosz et al., 1995) as
a theory of the local focus.
Secondly, although G&amp;S&apos;s theory integrates
ideas from both Grosz&apos;s and Sidner&apos;s original the-
ories, and although both of these theories assumed
a stack structure, the global focus in G&amp;S&apos;s the-
ory is structured as a stack of focus spaces, as in
Grosz&apos;s original proposal, rather than as a stack of
discourse foci, as in Sidner&apos;s original theory. The
claim that different parts of the attentional state are
accessed when resolving pronouns and definite de-
scriptions is supported, broadly speaking, by psy-
cholinguistic research (see, e.g., (Garrod, 1993)).
The main claims of centering theory are also con-
sistent with psycholinguistic results (Hudson, 1988;
Gordon et al., 1993). To our knowledge, however,
the choice of a stack of focus spaces over a stack
of discourse foci has never been motivated; yet this
decision plays a crucial role in our problem, as we
will see.
A point worth keeping in mind throughout the
following discussion is that, although the concept
of CB (centering theory&apos;s name for the current most
salient entity) was originally introduced as &apos;roughly
corresponding to Sidner&apos;s concept of discourse fo-
cus&apos;, in fact it is not clear that the two concepts are
capturing the same intuitions (Poesio and Steven-
son, 1998). Although it is often the case that the CB
and the discourse focus coincide, this is not true in
general.&apos; For the purposes of this paper, however,
we will assume that the two notions do coincide,
and will use the neutral term MOST SALIENT EN-
TITY (MSE) to refer to the discourse focus / CB of a
particular segment of text.
This intuitive impression was confirmed by a recent study
(Giouli. 1996). whose author tracked both the &apos;intuitive CB&apos; and
the &apos;intuitive discourse focus&apos; of 8 Map Task conversations.

3 The Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999266684210526">
The Intelligent Labelling Explorer (ILEx) project is
building a system that generates descriptions of ob-
jects displayed in a museum gallery.2 In order to
generate the most natural descriptions of the ob-
jects, dialogues with a museum curator were col-
lected, describing objects in the National Museum
of Scotland&apos;s 20th Century Jewellery Gallery. We
will refer to this corpus as the ILEX corpus. In the
dialogues, the curator (LG) moves from case to case
as directed by an observer (JO) and describes the
jewels in each case, as in example (1).
The work described here is part of two related
projects: SOLE, the goal of which is to extend
the ILEX system with the capability of generating
prosodically adequate speech, and GNOME, which
is concerned with the generation of nominal expres-
sions. A second corpus of museum object descrip-
tions was collected for use with SOLE; we will refer
to this corpus as the SOLE corpus.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997733">
4.1 First Hypothesis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961923076923">
Because G&amp;S&apos;s theory of the attentional state al-
ready hypothesises global focus structures in addi-
tion to the local attentional structures assumed in
centering theory, the simplest explanation for our
cases of long-distance pronominalisation is to hy-
pothesise that readers exploit the global focus to re-
solve pronouns in such cases.
Assuming that the global focus is involved in
these cases, instead of complicating the local fo-
cus/centering theory, is consistent with the little
available psychological evidence —e.g., with the re-
sults of Clark and Sengul (1979), who observed a
slowdown in reading times for the sentence con-
taining the pronoun when the antecedent is not in
the same or the previous sentence, implying that
long-distance pronominal anaphora are handled dif-
ferently.
Furthermore, suggesting that these pronouns are
resolved by accessing the global focus would not
really amount to a revision of the basic assump-
tions of G&amp;S&apos;s theory. Although no explicit pro-
posal concerning the respective roles of local fo-
cus and global focus in pronoun resolution has ever
been made in the literature on the G&amp;S framework,
cases of pronouns involving access to the global at-
tentional structure rather than to the local focus have

already been discussed in this literature. So-called
RETURN-POPS, which are pronouns that signal a re-
turn to a superordinate discourse segment, were dis-
cussed by Grosz (1977) and then in detail in (Fox,
1987). In (2), for example, sentence 5 resumes the
segment interrupted by 2-4; the antecedent for the
pronoun her is supposed to be found on the stack,
although the details of this process have never re-
ally been discussed.3

<bodyText confidence="0.906111692307693">
A second case of pronouns that clearly seem to in-
volve access to some global structure are so-called
&apos;generic&apos; pronouns, such as they in (3):
(3) John went back to the hotel. He looked for
Mary in their room, but couldn&apos;t find her. They
told him that she had left about an hour earlier.
(We are not aware of any account of these uses of
pronouns within the G&amp;S framework.)
As we will see in a moment, the long-distance
pronouns observed in the ILEX dialogues are neither
generic pronouns nor return-pops; nevertheless, we
are going to show that these cases, as well, are re-
solved by accessing the global focus.

4.2 Long-distance pronouns need not be
return-pops
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980862266666667">
The use of him in the last sentence of (1) could only
be termed a RETURN-POP if it were to involve a re-
turn to the previous discourse segment which &apos;pops
over&apos; sentence 4 (And ifyou look at, for instance, the
bangle at the bottom ... ) and &apos;closes off&apos; the ma-
terial introduced in that sentence. But this is clearly
not the case, as shown by the fact that the final sen-
tence contains a reference to both the jeweller and
the bangle. Indeed, the bangle could also be referred
to with a pronoun: And it took hiln something like
120 hours of work. The fact that pronouns and def-
inite NPs in the last sentence can refer back to ma-
terial in the 4th sentence indicates that this material
must still be on the stack.
&apos;This example is from (Pollack et at., 1982).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999786">
4.3 Discourse Structure in the Example Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964976744186">
Before discussing how the global focus is used for
resolving pronouns such as the long-distance pro-
noun in the last sentence of (1), we need to discuss
the structure of these examples: i.e., is the part of
(1) which has the jeweller as MSE (2nd sentence)
still on the stack when the part that describes details
of the jewel and contains the long-distance pronoun
(3rd and 4th sentence) is processed?
Answering this question is made more difficult by
the fact that G&amp;S&apos;s theory of the intentional struc-
ture is very abstract, and therefore does not help
much in specific cases, especially when the genre
is not task-oriented conversations. More specific
indications concerning the structure of the relevant
example, and more in general of the conversations
in the ILEX corpus, are given by Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988),4
although even with RST it is still possible to anal-
yse any given text in many different ways. Nev-
ertheless, we believe that the structure depicted in
Figure 1 is a plausible analysis for (1); an alterna-
tive analysis would be to take the 4th and 5th sen-
tence as elaborations of and he lavished on those
materials an incredibly painstaking technique ... ,
but in this case, as well (and in all other rhetorical
structures we could consider) sentences 4 and 5 are
satellites of sentence 3. (We have employed the set
of rhetorical relations currently used to analyse the
ILEX data.)
The relation between G&amp;S&apos;s and RST&apos;S notion
of structure has been analysed by, among others,
(Moore and Paris, 1993; Moser and Moore, 1996).
According to Moser and Moore, the relation can be
characterised as follows: an RST nucleus expresses
an intention In; a satellite expresses an intention Is;
and In dominates I. Thus, in (1), the nucleus of the
exemplification relation, sentence 3, would domi-
nate the satellite, consisting of sentences 4 and 5.
We will make the same assumption here. Hence
we can assume that the third sentence in (1) will
still be on the stack when processing the 4th and 5th
sentences. This would also hold for the alternative
rhetorical structures we have considered.5
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.95856975">
4Fox, as well, used RST to analyse the structure of texts in
her study of the effect of discourse structure on anaphora (Fox,
1987).
5Some readers might wonder whether it wouldn&apos;t be sim-
pler to assume that all of the utterances in (1) are part of the
same segment. This assumption would indeed make the an-
tecedent accessible; however, it would not explain the data, not
at least if we assume that it is centering theory that determines

4.4 What Goes on the Stack?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966235294118">
We can finally turn to the task of explaining how
the global focus is used to resolve long-distance
pronominalisations. The simplest explanation con-
sistent with the G&amp;S&apos;s framework would be to as-
sume that resolving such pronouns involves search-
ing for the first discourse entity in the focus space
stack that satisfies gender and number constraints.
Under the assumptions about the discourse struc-
ture of examples like (1) just discussed, this expla-
nation would indeed account for that example; there
is evidence, however, that additional constraints are
involved. The first bit of evidence is that the pres-
ence on the focus space stack of an appropriate an-
tecedent does not always make the use of a long
distance pronoun felicitous. Consider the follow-
ing fragment of an article that appeared in The
Guardian, January 28, 1995, p.3.

cashire, has six children. The eldest are two
I 7-year-old twin boys, one awaiting a heart by-
pass operation and the other with severe be-
havioral problems. A 13-year-old son has hy-
drocephalus. She was living with her hus-
band when Wigan magistrates ordered her to

he earned only £70 per week as a part-time

anaphoric reference, since centering does not explain how a
pronoun can refer to an antecedent two sentences back. Assum-
ing that there is more than one segment in such texts, instead,
will turn out to be not just a more plausible assumption about
segmentation: it will also give us a simple way to explain the
data.
The use of he in the last sentence is awkward, even
though there is a discourse entity on the focus space
stack— the husband— that would satisfy the con-
straints imposed by the pronoun. This seems to in-
dicate that the elements of a focus space are not all
equally accessible.
The second relevant bit of evidence concerns the
use of proper names in the ILEX corpus. It may hap-
pen in the ILEX dialogues that a designer like Jessie
King is first mentioned by name in a segment where
she is not the main topic of discussion, as in Other
jewels in the Bohemian style include a brooch by
Jessie King. If this is the case, then when later we&apos;re
talking about another jewel that King designed, she
will have to be introduced again with a full proper
name, Jessie King, rather than simply King. If, how-
ever, she becomes the &apos;main topic&apos; of discussion,
then later, whenever we talk about her again, we can
use reduced forms of her proper name, such as King.
Again, this difference is not easy to explain in terms
of focus spaces if we assume that all objects in a
focus space have the same status.
A third class of expressions providing evidence
relevant to this discussion are bridging descriptions,
i.e., definite descriptions like the door that refer to
an object associated with a previously mentioned
discourse entity such as the house, rather than to
the entity itself (Clark, 1977). Poesio et al. (1997;
1998) report experiments in which different types of
lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridg-
ing descriptions and other cases of definite descrip-
tions that require more than simple string match for
their resolution. Their results indicate that to re-
solve bridging descriptions it is not sufficient sim-
ply to find which of the entities in the current focus
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997276">
553
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806169230769">
space is semantically closest to the bridging descrip-
tion: in about half of the cases of bridging descrip-
tions that could be resolved on the basis of the lexi-
cal knowledge used in these experiments, the focus
spaces contained an entity whose description was
more closely related to that of the bridging descrip-
tion than the one of the actual antecedent(s).
This evidence about infelicitous pronouns, proper
names, and bridging descriptions suggests that the
entities in a focus space are not all equally salient.
In fact, one could even wonder if we need focus
spaces at all; i.e., if Sidner&apos;s original proposal - ac-
cording to which it&apos;s just the MSE that goes on the
stack, not the whole focus space - is correct. A re-
vision of G&amp;S&apos;s theory along these lines— i.e., in
which the focus space stack is replaced by an MSE
stack— would still explain (1), since the jeweller is
clearly the MSE of sentence 3; indeed, all 7 cases
of long-distance pronouns found in the ILEX corpus
have a previous MSE as their antecedent. But, in ad-
dition, this revision would explain the awkwardness
of (4): the husband was never an MSE, SO it would
not be on the stack.
A global focus of this type would also give us a
way to formulate a restriction on using shortened
forms of proper names that would account for the
facts observed in the ILEX corpus: reduced NPs
are allowed for entities that have been introduced
as MSES, full NPS are needed otherwise. And fi-
nally, keeping track of previous MSES seems essen-
tial for bridging descriptions as well: in order to
find the reasons for the low performance of algo-
rithms for resolving bridging descriptions entirely
based on lexical knowledge, (Poesio et al., 1998)
examined the bridging descriptions their corpus to
find out their &apos;preferred&apos; antecedent.6 They found
that the preferred antecedent of a bridging descrip-
tion is a previous MSE in 54 out of 203 cases. In
the SOLE corpus, 8 out of 11 bridging descriptions
relate to the MSE.
Does this mean, then, that we can get rid of fo-
cus spaces, and assume that it&apos;s ivIsEs that go on the
stack? Before looking at the data, we have to be
clear as to what would count as evidence one way
or the other. Even an approach in which only previ-
ous mSES are on the stack would still allow access to
entities which are part of what Grosz called the IM-
PLICIT FOCUS of these MSES, i.e., the entities that
As discussed in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), in general there
is more than one potential &apos;antecedent&apos; for a bridging descrip-
tion in a text.
are &apos;strongly associated&apos; with the MSES. This notion
of &apos;strong association&apos; is difficult to define— in fact,
it is likely to be a matter of degree— but nevertheless
it is plausible to assume that the objects &apos;strongly
associated&apos; with a discourse entity A do not include
every discourse entity B which is part of a situation
described in the text in which A is also involved; and
this can be tested with linguistic examples, up to a
point. For example, whereas definite descriptions
like the radiator cap can easily be resolved in a null
context to a car, descriptions like the dog can&apos;t, as
shown by the infelicity of (5d) as a continuation of
(5b), even though dogs in cars are not uncommon;
some contextual antecedent is needed.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990193962962963">
c. The radiator cap was shining in the sun.
d. The dog was enjoying the warmth.
The question we have to answer, then, is whether
the only information that is available as part of the
attentional state is what is &apos;strongly associated&apos; with
one of the previous MSES, or, instead, all of the in-
formation mentioned in the text.7
Now, sentences like (5a) license both bridging de-
scriptions to the car, as in (5c), and to Mary, as in
Her hat had become very hot. Whatever we take
the MSE of (5a) to be, it seems implausible to ar-
gue that both the bridging descriptions the radiator
cap and Her hat are resolved by looking at the ob-
jects &apos;strongly associated&apos; with that discourse entity.
It is much simpler to assume that both Mary and
the car are still accessible as part of the focus space
constructed to represent the situation described by
the text. This also holds for what we have called
&apos;generic&apos; pronouns, as shown by (3), in which they
refers to individuals associated with the hotel men-
tioned in the first sentence, not to the MSE, John.
And indeed, Sidner assumed two stacks— one of
discourse foci, the other of actor foci. But even
this extension would not be enough, because the an-
tecedent of a bridging description is not always an
entity explicitly introduced in the text, but can also
be a more abstract DISCOURSE TOPIC, by which we

7Notice however that the claim that only MSES go on the
stack does not entail that everything else in the text is simply
forgotten— the claim is simply that that information is not avail-
able for resolving references anymore; presumably it would
be stored somewhere in &apos;long term memory&apos;. Conversely,
the claim that everything stays on the stack would have to be
supplemented by some story concerning how information gets
forgotten—e.g., by some caching mechanism such as the one
proposed by Walker (1996).

mean an issue / proposition that can be said to char-
acterise the content of the focus space as a whole. In
a corpus analysis done in connection with (Poesio et
al., 1997; Poesio et al., 1998), we found that 7 out
of 70 inferential descriptions were of this type; in
the SOLE corpus, in which 3 out of 11 bridging de-
scriptions behave this way. An example of this use
is the description the problem below, that refers to
the problem introduced by the first sentence in the

Reference to abstract objects in general seem to re-
quire maintaining information about the events and
situations described by a text on the stack— see, e.g.,
(Webber, 1991). So, it looks like what we need is
something of a compromise between the notion of
global focus implicit in Sidner&apos;s original proposal
and that proposed by G&amp;S.

4.5 The proposal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.780287083333333">
The following hypothesis about the global focus and
its use in pronoun resolution seems to provide the
best account of the evidence we have examined:
1. The global focus consists of a stack of fo-
cus spaces, as in G&amp;S&apos;s proposal. Each of
these focus spaces can be summarised as be-
ing &apos;about&apos; some object / proposition / issue—
indeed, more than one— for which we will use
the term DISCOURSE TOPICS; but, in addition,
Each focus space may be optionally associated
with a MOST SALIENT ENTITY (MSE) explic-
itly introduced in the text.
3. The antecedent for a non-generic pronoun is
preferentially to be found in the local focus; if
none is available, one of the msEs associated
with a focus space on the stack can also serve
as antecedent.8
4. Generic pronouns refer back to the situation
described by the current focus space;
5. Bridging descriptions can be related either to
an entity in the current focus space, or to an
MSE, or to a discourse topic;
&apos;This would explain the difference in reading times ob-
served by (Clark and Sengul, 1979).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.677098">
6. Definite descriptions can refer back to any en-
tity in the global focus, including discourse
topics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958">
The reason for using the term &apos;optional&apos; in 2 is that
whereas focus spaces can always be described as be-
ing about something, they are not always associated

In a recent paper, Hahn and Strube (1997) propose
to extend centering theory with what is, essentially,
Sidner&apos;s stack of discourse foci, although their al-
gorithm for identifying the CP is not identical to
Sidner&apos;s. Their analysis of German texts shows a
rather good performance for their algorithm, but, as
only MSES are predicted to be accessible, none of
the anaphors depending on focus space information
could be resolved. Their algorithm also appears to
treat definite descriptions and pronouns uniformly
as &apos;anaphors&apos;, which seems problematic in the light
of psychological evidence showing that they behave
differently, and examples like the following:

(Guindon, 1985) proposed an alternative model
of the attentional state involving a cache instead of
a stack, and Walker (1996) argues that the cache
model can account for all of the data that origi-
nally motivated the stack model and, in addition,
explains the use of informationally redundant ut-
terances. The cache model isn&apos;t yet specified in
enough detail for all of its implications for the data
discussed here to be clear, but it appears that some
of the issues discussed in this paper would have to
be addressed in a cache model as well, and that
some of our conclusions would apply in a model
of that type as well. In particular, these propos-
als are not very specific about whether the cache
should count as a replacement of just the global fo-
cus component of G&amp;S&apos;s theory or of both local
and global focus, and about what should go in the
cache—Guindon seems to assume that it&apos;s discourse
entities, whereas Walker also seems to allow for
propositions and relational information. If the cache
was intended as an alternative model of the global
focus component, the data discussed here could be

Our main intent in looking at long-distance pronom-
inalisation was to make some of the aspects of the
G&amp;S model of attentional state more precise, and
to clarify its connection with earlier work by Sid-
ner. The evidence we have presented suggests a
main conclusion and a corollary. The main conclu-
sion is that the uses of long-distance pronouns in our
corpus can be explained as cases of reference to the
MSE of a segment whose associated focus space is
still on the stack. The corollary is that these ex-
amples can be accounted for within a G&amp;S-style
model of discourse structure, provided that the the-
ory is augmented by singling out some entities in
focus spaces, and having these entities do some of
the work done by Sidner&apos;s stack of discourse foci.
A concern with studies of this type is that notions
such as &apos;most salient entity&apos; are hard to define, and
it&apos;s not obvious that two different researchers would
necessarily agree on what is the MSE of a given sen-
tence. Work on verifying whether the notion we are
assuming can indeed be reliably identified is under
way as part of the GNOME project.

<abstract confidence="0.995894821180556">Our corpus of descriptive text contains a significant number of long-distance pronominal references (8.4% of the total). In order to account for how these pronouns are interpreted, we re-examine Grosz and Sidner&apos;s theory of the attentional state, and in particular the use of the global focus to supplement centering theory. Our corpus evidence concerning these long-distance pronominal references, as well as studies of the use of descriptions, proper names and ambiguous uses of pronouns, lead us to conclude that a discourse focus stack mechanism of the type proposed by Sidner is essential to account for the use of these referring expressions. We suggest revising the Grosz &amp; Sidner framework by allowing for the possibility that an entity in a focus space may have special status. 1 Motivation call PRONOMINALISATIONS those cases of pronoun use in which the antecedent of the pronoun does not occur either in the same sentence as the pronoun or in the immediately preceding one, but further back in the text. These cases are thought to be rare on the basis of studies such as (Hobbs, 1978), which found that 98% of pronoun antecedents in the corpus analysed were in the same sentence as the pronoun or the previous one. However, our analysis of a small corpus of oral deof museum items collected for the project (Hitzeman et al., 1997) revealed that longdistance pronouns are much more common in this kind of data —four times as common, in fact: out of a total of 83 pronouns, 7 (8.4%) were long-distance. The typical pattern of long-distance pronominalisain the is shown in (1), where the the last sentence refers to jewmost recently two sentences earlier. Okay, thank you. Shall we look at the object in case number 16, number 1? There&apos;s a set of three objects here. LG: I. Yes. 2. What these symbolise for me are one of the preoccupations of the 1980s, which is recycling. The jeweller made these bangles was particularly interested in the idea of using intrinsically worthless material— material that had been thrown away, old junk— and he lavished on those materials an incredibly painstaking and time-consuming technique, so that the amount of time put into the labour of making these jewels bears absolutely no relation to the value of the materials that he&apos;s used. 4. And if you look at, for instance, the bangle at the bottom— that&apos;s the blue and red one— what looks as though it&apos;s painted decoration is in fact inlaid; it&apos;s bits of cut-off razor-blade, biro. knitting needles, inlaid into layer after layer of resin, which is done in emulation of Japanese lacquer technique. And that particular bangle took like 120 hours of work. 7 long-distance pronouns in the we have studied refer to discourse entities introduced in background text in this way. Unlike Sidner&apos;s theory of focus (Sidner, 1979), the theory of the attentional state in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) (henceforth: G&amp;S) does not include explicit provision for long-distance pronominalisations, although some of the necessary tools are potentially already there, as we will see. The component of the theory that deals with pronominal reference, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), only accounts for cases in which the antecedent of a pronoun is introduced by the previous sentence; cases such as (1) have to be handled by different mechanisms. In this paper we look the phenomenon of long-distance pronominalisation in some detail, examining data from different domains, and consider 550 its implications for G&amp;S&apos;s theory. 2 Theories of focus Space unfortunately prevents a full discussion of Grosz&apos;s (1977), Sidner&apos;s (1979), and G&amp;S&apos;s (1986) theories of focus and the attentional state in this abstract. The crucial aspects of these theories, for the purpose of the discussion below, are as follows. First of all, G&amp;S propose a distinction between two of the attentional state: the as a stack of focus spaces and accessed to interpret definite descriptions; and the LOof the information preferentially used to interpret pronouns. In addition, they THEORY et al., 1995) as a theory of the local focus. Secondly, although G&amp;S&apos;s theory integrates ideas from both Grosz&apos;s and Sidner&apos;s original theories, and although both of these theories assumed a stack structure, the global focus in G&amp;S&apos;s theory is structured as a stack of focus spaces, as in Grosz&apos;s original proposal, rather than as a stack of discourse foci, as in Sidner&apos;s original theory. The claim that different parts of the attentional state are accessed when resolving pronouns and definite descriptions is supported, broadly speaking, by psycholinguistic research (see, e.g., (Garrod, 1993)). The main claims of centering theory are also consistent with psycholinguistic results (Hudson, 1988; Gordon et al., 1993). To our knowledge, however, the choice of a stack of focus spaces over a stack of discourse foci has never been motivated; yet this decision plays a crucial role in our problem, as we will see. A point worth keeping in mind throughout the following discussion is that, although the concept theory&apos;s name for the current most salient entity) was originally introduced as &apos;roughly corresponding to Sidner&apos;s concept of discourse focus&apos;, in fact it is not clear that the two concepts are capturing the same intuitions (Poesio and Steven- 1998). Although it is often the case that the and the discourse focus coincide, this is not true in general.&apos; For the purposes of this paper, however, we will assume that the two notions do coincide, will use the neutral term SALIENT EN- (MSE) refer to the discourse focus / a particular segment of text. This intuitive impression was confirmed by a recent study 1996). whose author tracked both the &apos;intuitive the &apos;intuitive discourse focus&apos; of 8 Map Task conversations. 3 The Data The Intelligent Labelling Explorer (ILEx) project is building a system that generates descriptions of obdisplayed in a museum In order to generate the most natural descriptions of the objects, dialogues with a museum curator were collected, describing objects in the National Museum of Scotland&apos;s 20th Century Jewellery Gallery. We refer to this corpus as the In the dialogues, the curator (LG) moves from case to case as directed by an observer (JO) and describes the jewels in each case, as in example (1). The work described here is part of two related goal of which is to extend with the capability of generating adequate speech, and is concerned with the generation of nominal expressions. A second corpus of museum object descripwas collected for use with will refer this corpus as the 4 Analysis 4.1 First Hypothesis Because G&amp;S&apos;s theory of the attentional state already hypothesises global focus structures in addition to the local attentional structures assumed in centering theory, the simplest explanation for our cases of long-distance pronominalisation is to hypothesise that readers exploit the global focus to resolve pronouns in such cases. Assuming that the global focus is involved in these cases, instead of complicating the local focus/centering theory, is consistent with the little available psychological evidence —e.g., with the results of Clark and Sengul (1979), who observed a slowdown in reading times for the sentence containing the pronoun when the antecedent is not in the same or the previous sentence, implying that long-distance pronominal anaphora are handled differently. Furthermore, suggesting that these pronouns are resolved by accessing the global focus would not really amount to a revision of the basic assumptions of G&amp;S&apos;s theory. Although no explicit proposal concerning the respective roles of local focus and global focus in pronoun resolution has ever been made in the literature on the G&amp;S framework, cases of pronouns involving access to the global attentional structure rather than to the local focus have systemintro.html 551 already been discussed in this literature. So-called are pronouns that signal a return to a superordinate discourse segment, were discussed by Grosz (1977) and then in detail in (Fox, 1987). In (2), for example, sentence 5 resumes the segment interrupted by 2-4; the antecedent for the supposed to be found on the stack, although the details of this process have never rebeen (2) 1. C: Ok Harry. I&apos;m have a problem that my—with today&apos;s economy daughter is working, 2. H: I missed your name. 3. C: Hank. 4. H: Go ahead Hank. C: well as her husband A second case of pronouns that clearly seem to involve access to some global structure are so-called pronouns, such as (3): went back to the hotel. He looked for in their room, but couldn&apos;t find her. told him that she had left about an hour earlier. are aware of any account of these uses of pronouns within the G&amp;S framework.) As we will see in a moment, the long-distance observed in the are neither generic pronouns nor return-pops; nevertheless, we are going to show that these cases, as well, are reaccessing the global focus. 4.2 Long-distance pronouns need not be return-pops use of the last sentence of (1) could only termed a it were to involve a return to the previous discourse segment which &apos;pops sentence 4 look at, for instance, the at the bottom ... ) &apos;closes off&apos; the material introduced in that sentence. But this is clearly not the case, as shown by the fact that the final sentence contains a reference to both the jeweller and the bangle. Indeed, the bangle could also be referred with a pronoun: it took hiln something like hours of work. fact that pronouns and definite NPs in the last sentence can refer back to material in the 4th sentence indicates that this material must still be on the stack. &apos;This example is from (Pollack et at., 1982). 4.3 Discourse Structure in the Example Text Before discussing how the global focus is used for resolving pronouns such as the long-distance proin the last sentence of need to discuss the structure of these examples: i.e., is the part of which has the jeweller as sentence) still on the stack when the part that describes details of the jewel and contains the long-distance pronoun (3rd and 4th sentence) is processed? Answering this question is made more difficult by the fact that G&amp;S&apos;s theory of the intentional structure is very abstract, and therefore does not help much in specific cases, especially when the genre is not task-oriented conversations. More specific indications concerning the structure of the relevant example, and more in general of the conversations the are given by Rhetorical Struc- Theory and Thompson, even with is still possible to analyse any given text in many different ways. Nevertheless, we believe that the structure depicted in Figure 1 is a plausible analysis for (1); an alternative analysis would be to take the 4th and 5th senas elaborations of he lavished on those materials an incredibly painstaking technique ... , but in this case, as well (and in all other rhetorical structures we could consider) sentences 4 and 5 are satellites of sentence 3. (We have employed the set of rhetorical relations currently used to analyse the ILEX data.) relation between G&amp;S&apos;s and of structure has been analysed by, among others, (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moser and Moore, 1996). According to Moser and Moore, the relation can be as follows: an expresses intention satellite expresses an intention in (1), the nucleus of the exemplification relation, sentence 3, would dominate the satellite, consisting of sentences 4 and 5. We will make the same assumption here. Hence we can assume that the third sentence in (1) will still be on the stack when processing the 4th and 5th sentences. This would also hold for the alternative structures we have as well, used analyse the structure of texts in her study of the effect of discourse structure on anaphora (Fox, 1987). readers might wonder whether it wouldn&apos;t be simpler to assume that all of the utterances in (1) are part of the same segment. This assumption would indeed make the antecedent accessible; however, it would not explain the data, not at least if we assume that it is centering theory that determines 552 EXEMPLIFICATION Jewelle particularly interested in using worthless material&apos; CONSEQUENCE And if you look at, for instance .... that particular bangle took .... The jeweller who made these so that the amount of time he bangles .... put into the labour .... Figure 1: A possible analysis of (1). 4.4 What Goes on the Stack? We can finally turn to the task of explaining how the global focus is used to resolve long-distance pronominalisations. The simplest explanation consistent with the G&amp;S&apos;s framework would be to assume that resolving such pronouns involves searching for the first discourse entity in the focus space stack that satisfies gender and number constraints. Under the assumptions about the discourse structure of examples like (1) just discussed, this explanation would indeed account for that example; there is evidence, however, that additional constraints are involved. The first bit of evidence is that the presence on the focus space stack of an appropriate antecedent does not always make the use of a long distance pronoun felicitous. Consider the followfragment of an article that appeared in 28, 1995, p.3. Partington, aged 44, from Bolton, Lancashire, has six children. The eldest are two I 7-year-old twin boys, one awaiting a heart bypass operation and the other with severe behavioral problems. A 13-year-old son has hydrocephalus. She was living with her husband when Wigan magistrates ordered her to be jailed unless she paid 15 per week, although he earned only £70 per week as a part-time postman. anaphoric reference, since centering does not explain how a pronoun can refer to an antecedent two sentences back. Assuming that there is more than one segment in such texts, instead, will turn out to be not just a more plausible assumption about segmentation: it will also give us a simple way to explain the data. use of the last sentence is awkward, even though there is a discourse entity on the focus space stack— the husband— that would satisfy the constraints imposed by the pronoun. This seems to inthat the elements of a focus space are not equally accessible. The second relevant bit of evidence concerns the of proper names in the It may hapin the that a designer like first mentioned by name in a segment where is not the main topic of discussion, as in jewels in the Bohemian style include a brooch by King. this is case, then when later we&apos;re talking about another jewel that King designed, she will have to be introduced again with a full proper King, than simply however, she becomes the &apos;main topic&apos; of discussion, then later, whenever we talk about her again, we can reduced forms of her proper name, such as Again, this difference is not easy to explain in terms of focus spaces if we assume that all objects in a focus space have the same status. A third class of expressions providing evidence relevant to this discussion are bridging descriptions, definite descriptions like door refer to an object associated with a previously mentioned entity such as house, than to the entity itself (Clark, 1977). Poesio et al. (1997; 1998) report experiments in which different types of lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridging descriptions and other cases of definite descriptions that require more than simple string match for their resolution. Their results indicate that to resolve bridging descriptions it is not sufficient simto find of the entities in the current focus 553 space is semantically closest to the bridging description: in about half of the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved on the basis of the lexical knowledge used in these experiments, the focus spaces contained an entity whose description was more closely related to that of the bridging description than the one of the actual antecedent(s). This evidence about infelicitous pronouns, proper names, and bridging descriptions suggests that the entities in a focus space are not all equally salient. In fact, one could even wonder if we need focus spaces at all; i.e., if Sidner&apos;s original proposal acto which it&apos;s just the goes on the stack, not the whole focus space is correct. A revision of G&amp;S&apos;s theory along these lines— i.e., in the focus space stack is replaced by an would still explain (1), since jeweller the sentence 3; indeed, all 7 cases long-distance pronouns found in the a previous their antecedent. But, in addition, this revision would explain the awkwardness (4): the husband was never an SO would not be on the stack. A global focus of this type would also give us a way to formulate a restriction on using shortened forms of proper names that would account for the observed in the reduced NPs are allowed for entities that have been introduced needed otherwise. And fikeeping track of previous essential for bridging descriptions as well: in order to find the reasons for the low performance of algorithms for resolving bridging descriptions entirely based on lexical knowledge, (Poesio et al., 1998) examined the bridging descriptions their corpus to out their &apos;preferred&apos; They found that the preferred antecedent of a bridging descripis a previous 54 out of 203 cases. In 8 out of 11 bridging descriptions to the Does this mean, then, that we can get rid of focus spaces, and assume that it&apos;s ivIsEs that go on the stack? Before looking at the data, we have to be clear as to what would count as evidence one way or the other. Even an approach in which only previous mSES are on the stack would still allow access to entities which are part of what Grosz called the IMthese the entities that in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), in general there is more than one potential &apos;antecedent&apos; for a bridging description in a text. &apos;strongly associated&apos; with the notion of &apos;strong association&apos; is difficult to define— in fact, it is likely to be a matter of degree— but nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the objects &apos;strongly associated&apos; with a discourse entity A do not include every discourse entity B which is part of a situation described in the text in which A is also involved; and this can be tested with linguistic examples, up to a point. For example, whereas definite descriptions radiator cap easily be resolved in a null to car, like dog as shown by the infelicity of (5d) as a continuation of (5b), even though dogs in cars are not uncommon; some contextual antecedent is needed. a. saw a car go by quickly. b. It was a bright, warm day. The radiator cap in the sun. The dog the warmth. The question we have to answer, then, is whether the only information that is available as part of the attentional state is what is &apos;strongly associated&apos; with of the previous instead, all of the inmentioned in the Now, sentences like (5a) license both bridging descriptions to the car, as in (5c), and to Mary, as in hat had become very hot. we take (5a) to be, it seems implausible to arthat both the bridging descriptions radiator hat resolved by looking at the objects &apos;strongly associated&apos; with that discourse entity. is much simpler to assume that and the car are still accessible as part of the focus space constructed to represent the situation described by the text. This also holds for what we have called pronouns, as shown by which refers to individuals associated with the hotel menin the first sentence, not to the indeed, Sidner assumed one of discourse foci, the other of actor foci. But even this extension would not be enough, because the antecedent of a bridging description is not always an entity explicitly introduced in the text, but can also a more abstract TOPIC, which we however that the claim that only on the stack does not entail that everything else in the text is simply forgotten— the claim is simply that that information is not available for resolving references anymore; presumably it would be stored somewhere in &apos;long term memory&apos;. Conversely, the claim that everything stays on the stack would have to be supplemented by some story concerning how information gets forgotten—e.g., by some caching mechanism such as the one proposed by Walker (1996). 554 mean an issue / proposition that can be said to characterise the content of the focus space as a whole. In a corpus analysis done in connection with (Poesio et al., 1997; Poesio et al., 1998), we found that 7 out of 70 inferential descriptions were of this type; in in which 3 out of 11 bridging descriptions behave this way. An example of this use the description problem that refers to the problem introduced by the first sentence in the text: Solo players have to be creative if they want to work a lot, because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited. ...The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line problem... abstract objects in general seem to require maintaining information about the events and situations described by a text on the stack— see, e.g., (Webber, 1991). So, it looks like what we need is something of a compromise between the notion of global focus implicit in Sidner&apos;s original proposal and that proposed by G&amp;S. 4.5 The proposal The following hypothesis about the global focus and its use in pronoun resolution seems to provide the best account of the evidence we have examined: 1. The global focus consists of a stack of focus spaces, as in G&amp;S&apos;s proposal. Each of these focus spaces can be summarised as being &apos;about&apos; some object / proposition / issue— indeed, more than one— for which we will use term TOPICS; in addition, Each focus space may be optionally associated a SALIENT ENTITY (MSE) explicitly introduced in the text. 3. The antecedent for a non-generic pronoun is preferentially to be found in the local focus; if none is available, one of the msEs associated with a focus space on the stack can also serve 4. Generic pronouns refer back to the situation described by the current focus space; 5. Bridging descriptions can be related either to an entity in the current focus space, or to an to a discourse topic; &apos;This would explain the difference in reading times observed by (Clark and Sengul, 1979). 6. Definite descriptions can refer back to any entity in the global focus, including discourse topics. The reason for using the term &apos;optional&apos; in 2 is that whereas focus spaces can always be described as being about something, they are not always associated with a &apos;most salient entity&apos;: e.g., the first sentence in (6) introduces several topics (woodwind players, their need to be creative, etc.) but does not introduce 5 Related Work In a recent paper, Hahn and Strube (1997) propose to extend centering theory with what is, essentially, Sidner&apos;s stack of discourse foci, although their alfor identifying the not identical to Sidner&apos;s. Their analysis of German texts shows a rather good performance for their algorithm, but, as predicted to be accessible, none of the anaphors depending on focus space information could be resolved. Their algorithm also appears to treat definite descriptions and pronouns uniformly as &apos;anaphors&apos;, which seems problematic in the light of psychological evidence showing that they behave differently, and examples like the following: (7) a. John, saw Mary. He, greeted her. b. John, saw Mary. ??The man, greeted her. (Guindon, 1985) proposed an alternative model of the attentional state involving a cache instead of a stack, and Walker (1996) argues that the cache model can account for all of the data that originally motivated the stack model and, in addition, explains the use of informationally redundant utterances. The cache model isn&apos;t yet specified in enough detail for all of its implications for the data discussed here to be clear, but it appears that some of the issues discussed in this paper would have to be addressed in a cache model as well, and that some of our conclusions would apply in a model of that type as well. In particular, these proposals are not very specific about whether the cache should count as a replacement of just the global focus component of G&amp;S&apos;s theory or of both local and global focus, and about what should go in the cache—Guindon seems to assume that it&apos;s discourse entities, whereas Walker also seems to allow for propositions and relational information. If the cache was intended as an alternative model of the global focus component, the data discussed here could be 555 taken as an argument that what goes in the cache should be focus spaces with distinguished msEs. 6 Conclusions Our main intent in looking at long-distance pronominalisation was to make some of the aspects of the G&amp;S model of attentional state more precise, and to clarify its connection with earlier work by Sidner. The evidence we have presented suggests a main conclusion and a corollary. The main conclusion is that the uses of long-distance pronouns in our corpus can be explained as cases of reference to the a segment whose associated focus space is still on the stack. The corollary is that these examples can be accounted for within a G&amp;S-style model of discourse structure, provided that the theory is augmented by singling out some entities in focus spaces, and having these entities do some of the work done by Sidner&apos;s stack of discourse foci. A concern with studies of this type is that notions such as &apos;most salient entity&apos; are hard to define, and it&apos;s not obvious that two different researchers would agree on what is the a given sentence. Work on verifying whether the notion we are assuming can indeed be reliably identified is under as part of the</abstract>

Assuming that the global focus is involved in these cases, instead of complicating the local focus/centering theory, is consistent with the little available psychological evidence —e.g., with the results of Clark and Sengul (1979), who observed a slowdown in reading times for the sentence containing the pronoun when the antecedent is not in the same or the previous sentence, implying that long-distance pronominal anaphora are handled differently. Furthermore, suggesting that these pronouns are resolved by accessing the global focus would not really amount to a revision of the basic assumptions of G&amp;S&apos;s theory. Although no explicit proposal concerning the respective roles of local focus and global focus in pronoun resolution has ever been made in the literature on the G&amp;S framework, cases of pronouns involving access to</context>

The antecedent for a non-generic pronoun is preferentially to be found in the local focus; if none is available, one of the msEs associated with a focus space on the stack can also serve as antecedent.8 4. Generic pronouns refer back to the situation described by the current focus space; 5. Bridging descriptions can be related either to an entity in the current focus space, or to an MSE, or to a discourse topic; &apos;This would explain the difference in reading times observed by (Clark and Sengul, 1979). 6. Definite descriptions can refer back to any entity in the global focus, including discourse topics. The reason for using the term &apos;optional&apos; in 2 is that whereas focus spaces can always be described as being about something, they are not always associated with a &apos;most salient entity&apos;: e.g., the first sentence in (6) introduces several topics (woodwind players, their need to be creative, etc.) but does not introduce an MSE. 5 Related Work In a recent paper, Hahn and Strube (1997) propose to extend centering theory with what is, essentially, Sidner&apos;s stack of discourse foci, although their </context>

If, however, she becomes the &apos;main topic&apos; of discussion, then later, whenever we talk about her again, we can use reduced forms of her proper name, such as King. Again, this difference is not easy to explain in terms of focus spaces if we assume that all objects in a focus space have the same status. A third class of expressions providing evidence relevant to this discussion are bridging descriptions, i.e., definite descriptions like the door that refer to an object associated with a previously mentioned discourse entity such as the house, rather than to the entity itself (Clark, 1977). Poesio et al. (1997; 1998) report experiments in which different types of lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridging descriptions and other cases of definite descriptions that require more than simple string match for their resolution. Their results indicate that to resolve bridging descriptions it is not sufficient simply to find which of the entities in the current focus 553 space is semantically closest to the bridging description: in about half of the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved on the basis of the lexical knowledge used in these experiments, the foc</context>

So-called RETURN-POPS, which are pronouns that signal a return to a superordinate discourse segment, were discussed by Grosz (1977) and then in detail in (Fox, 1987).

This would also hold for the alternative rhetorical structures we have considered.5 4Fox, as well, used RST to analyse the structure of texts in her study of the effect of discourse structure on anaphora (Fox, 1987). 5Some readers might wonder whether it wouldn&apos;t be simpler to assume that all of the utterances in (1) are part of the same segment.

These cases are thought to be rare on the basis of studies such as (Hobbs, 1978), which found that 98% of pronoun antecedents in the corpus analysed were in the same sentence as the pronoun or the previous one. However, our analysis of a small corpus of oral descriptions of museum items collected for the ILEX project (Hitzeman et al., 1997) revealed that longdistance pronouns are much more common in this kind of data —four times as common, in fact: out of a total of 83 pronouns, 7 (8.4%) were long-distance. The typical pattern of long-distance pronominalisation in the ILEX dialogues is shown in (1), where the pronoun him in the last sentence refers to the jeweller, mentioned most recently two sentences earlier.

We suggest revising the Grosz &amp; Sidner framework by allowing for the possibility that an entity in a focus space may have special status. 1 Motivation We call LONG-DISTANCE PRONOMINALISATIONS those cases of pronoun use in which the antecedent of the pronoun does not occur either in the same sentence as the pronoun or in the immediately preceding one, but further back in the text. These cases are thought to be rare on the basis of studies such as (Hobbs, 1978), which found that 98% of pronoun antecedents in the corpus analysed were in the same sentence as the pronoun or the previous one. However, our analysis of a small corpus of oral descriptions of museum items collected for the ILEX project (Hitzeman et al., 1997) revealed that longdistance pronouns are much more common in this kind of data —four times as common, in fact: out of a total of 83 pronouns, 7 (8.4%) were long-distance. The typical pattern of long-distance pronominalisation in the ILEX dialogues is shown in (1), where the pronoun him in the last sentence refers to the jeweller, mentio</context>

The claim that different parts of the attentional state are accessed when resolving pronouns and definite descriptions is supported, broadly speaking, by psycholinguistic research (see, e.g., (Garrod, 1993)). The main claims of centering theory are also consistent with psycholinguistic results (Hudson, 1988; Gordon et al., 1993). To our knowledge, however, the choice of a stack of focus spaces over a stack of discourse foci has never been motivated; yet this decision plays a crucial role in our problem, as we will see.

More specific indications concerning the structure of the relevant example, and more in general of the conversations in the ILEX corpus, are given by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988),4 although even with RST it is still possible to analyse any given text in many different ways.

Again, this difference is not easy to explain in terms of focus spaces if we assume that all objects in a focus space have the same status. A third class of expressions providing evidence relevant to this discussion are bridging descriptions, i.e., definite descriptions like the door that refer to an object associated with a previously mentioned discourse entity such as the house, rather than to the entity itself (Clark, 1977). Poesio et al. (1997; 1998) report experiments in which different types of lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridging descriptions and other cases of definite descriptions that require more than simple string match for their resolution. Their results indicate that to resolve bridging descriptions it is not sufficient simply to find which of the entities in the current focus 553 space is semantically closest to the bridging description: in about half of the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved on the basis of the lexical knowledge used in these experiments, the focus spaces contained a</context>

A global focus of this type would also give us a way to formulate a restriction on using shortened forms of proper names that would account for the facts observed in the ILEX corpus: reduced NPs are allowed for entities that have been introduced as MSES, full NPS are needed otherwise. And finally, keeping track of previous MSES seems essential for bridging descriptions as well: in order to find the reasons for the low performance of algorithms for resolving bridging descriptions entirely based on lexical knowledge, (Poesio et al., 1998) examined the bridging descriptions their corpus to find out their &apos;preferred&apos; antecedent.6 They found that the preferred antecedent of a bridging description is a previous MSE in 54 out of 203 cases.
