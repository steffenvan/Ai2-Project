This paper complements a series of works on
implicative verbs such as manage to and fail
to. It extends the description of simple im-
plicative verbs to phrasal implicatives as take
the time to and waste the chance to. It shows
that the implicative signatures of over 300
verb-noun collocations depend both on the se-
mantic type of the verb and the semantic type
of the noun in a systematic way.

<bodyText confidence="0.999867428571429">
There is a substantial body of literature on the se-
mantics of English complement constructions start-
ing with (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970) and (Kart-
tunen, 1971; Karttunen, 1973), including (Rudanko,
1989; Rudanko, 2002; Nairn et al., 2006; Egan,
2008). These studies have developed a semantic
classification of verbs and verb-noun collocations
that take sentential complements. They focus on
constructions that give rise to implied commitments
that the author cannot disavow without being inco-
herent or without contradicting herself. For exam-
ple, (1a) presupposes that Kim had not rescheduled
the meeting, (1b) entails that she didn’t and presup-
poses that she intended to reschedule it.

FACTIVE constructions like forget that X involve
presuppositions, IMPLICATIVE constructions like
forget to X give rise to entailments and may carry
presuppositions.
Presuppositions persist under negation, in ques-
tions and if-clauses, entailments do not. For ex-
ample, the negation of (1b), Kim did not forget
to reschedule the meeting, entails that Kim did
reschedule the meeting and presupposes, as (1b)
does, that it was her intention to do so.
Implicative constructions involve entailments.
The entailment may be positive or negative depend-
ing on the polarity of the containing clauses. Replac-
ing forget by didn’tforget in (1b) gives an entailment
of the opposite polarity. Questions and if-clauses do
not yield any entailments.

The constructions forget to X and remember to X are
two-way implicative constructions. They yield an
entailment about the truth or falsity of X both in af-
firmative and in negative sentences. We use the no-
tation + −  |− + for the verb forget to to indicate that
forget to X yields a negative entailment for X in a posi-
tive context, +−, and a positive entailment in a negative
context, −+. The first sign stands for the polarity of the
embedding context, the second sign for the polarity of the
entailment. We code the verb remember to as + +  |− −
because in a positive context remember to X yields a pos-
itive entailment about X, ++, and the opposite, −−, in a
negative context.
There are two major types of implicative construc-
tions. TWO-WAY IMPLICATIVES like forget to and re-
member to yield an entailment both in positive and neg-
ative contexts, ONE-WAY IMPLICATIVES yield an entail-
ment only under one polarity. Karttunen (1971; 1973)
and Nairn et al. (2006) list verbs of both types. Table 1
gives a few examples of two-way implicatives.

The type of the complementizer that a verb takes may

X is factive but forget to X is a + −  |− + implicative con-
struction. (1a) presupposes that Kim had not rescheduled
the meeting, (1b) entails that she didn’t.1 If we replace
forgot in (1) by didn’t forget, the presupposition of (1a)
remains intact but the entailment of (1b) reverses polar-
ity: Kim did reschedule the meeting.2 In contrast to for-
get, pretend that X and pretend to X are both counterfac-
tive. The sentences in (2) and their affirmative counter-

Constructions such as manage to X and fail to X are per-
fectly symmetrical in that they yield an entailment both
in affirmative and negative contexts. As noted early on,
(Karttunen, 1971; Karttunen, 1973), there are four types
of verbs that yield an entailment about their complement
clause only under one or the other polarity.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999339">
2.3 Ambiguity of not wait to X
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855">
The construction not wait to X can be understood in two
ways. The example in (12a) could be continued either
with (12b) or (12c).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934575666666667">
(12) a. Ed did not wait to call for help.
b.... Instead he left the scene in a hurry.
c.... But it was too late.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997535">
The continuation (12b) implies that Ed did not call for
help, (12c) implies that Ed called for help right away. The
word instead in (12b) and the anaphoric it in (12c) are
clues that indicate whether Ed made a call or not.
A Google search finds numerous examples of both
types. The sentences in (13) contain wait to X in the −−
sense, in the the examples in (14) it has the −+ interpre-
tation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6856774">
(13) a. Deena did not wait to talk to anyone. Instead,
she ran home.
b. He did not wait to hear Ms. Coulter’s response,
but immediately walked up the balcony stairs
and left.
</listItem>
<construct confidence="0.910806666666667">
4Although not hesitate to X seems to deny that there was
any hesitation to X, many examples from the web suggest oth-
erwise: When I got the paper back I almost hesitated to see the
grade, but when I saw the A on the title page, that hesitation
quickly turned into relief. Not hesitate to X is an idiom, it is not
compositional.
</construct>
<listItem confidence="0.606407714285714">
(14) a. It hurt like hell, but I’m glad she didn’t wait to
tell me.
b. Kalamazoo didn’t wait to strike back. The K-
Wings scored two goals in less than 90 seconds.
c. I didn’t wait to open the gift. Heck, I didn’t
even wait to wear them. They’re the softest most
comfy overalls I’ve ever owned.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
The construction not wait to X is not vague about the
truth or falsity of the complement. Either it means that
X was not done at all or it means that X was done right
away without delay. In most contexts it is immediately
clear which interpretation the author has in mind. The
ambiguity mostly goes unnoticed.
The source of the ambiguity can be seen in examples
where wait to has two infinitival complements.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.924842625">
(15) a. “My biggest regret is that I didn’t wait [to get
married] [to have kids]” says Gerald, a father of
three. “If I had it to do over again, I’d wait until
I was married to become a father.”
b. Chances are, you probably didn’t wait [to get
permission from the scientific establishment] [to
start believing in the creative power of thought
and the underlying spirituality of the universe].
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.963079375">
c. I raised my hand above my head, as if I were in
school or something, but didn’t wait [for anyone
to give me the “okay”] [to start talking].
The examples in (15) have the form not wait [to X] [to
Y]. They entail that X did not happen but Y is true. In
other words wait to is −− with respect to its first comple-
ment and −+ with respect to the second. In (15a) Gerald
did not get married but had kids. In (15b) the addressee
probably started believing without the permission of the
scientific establishment.
The implicit assumption in these cases is that one
might see X as a precondition for Y but the protagonist
skipped X and proceeded directly to Y. The ambiguity
arises from the fact that syntactically the two comple-
ments of wait to are both optional.
In the case of (15a), Gerald might have said My great-
est regret is that I didn’t wait to get married leaving out
the second complement, or he might have said My great-
est regret is that I didn’t wait to have kids leaving out the
first.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999203125">
In the case of (12a) that is ambiguous without a con-
text, the reader has to guess whether it should be read
as Ed did not wait [to call for help][... ] or Ed did not
wait [... ] [to call for help]. The continuation (12b) is
consistent with the first option, (12c) with the second.
The fact that the ambiguity of (12a) is syntactic rather
than semantic explains why it is not possible to translate
this sentence to languages such as Finnish, German and
French in a way that preserves the ambiguity. The trans-
lator has to decide which of the two interpretations is the
right one because they translate differently. In this re-
spect (12a) is similar to well known examples such as
time flies like an arrow and I saw her duck that have no
ambiguity-preserving translations in other languages be-
cause the ambiguity comes from accidental lexical and
syntactic overlaps that are language-specific.

2.4 Invited inferences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994524933333333">
Although one-way implicatives yield a definite entail-
ment only under one polarity, in many contexts they are
interpreted as if they were two-way implicatives. For ex-
ample, the complement of prevent from in negative sen-
tences such as (16) is likely to be understood to be true
and the author probably intended the sentence to be inter-
preted in that way.
(16) The language barrier did not prevent us from having
a few laughs together.
If something was not prevented or if someone could do it,
it may have happened. If someone was not forced to do
something or hesitated doing it, maybe she did not do it.
However, an explicit denial is possible as in (17) showing
that the inference about the veridicality of the comple-
ment is pragmatically based, not truth-conditional.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.634503142857143">
(17) a. Her mother did not prevent her from visiting her
father, but she never did.
b. He showed he could jab, but didn’t. He showed
he could work the body, but didn’t.

but they left on their own.
d. She hesitated to ask, but had to: “Stateside?”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968823529412">
The promotion of can and be able to from a one-way
implicative to a two-way implicative is similar to the phe-
nomenon that (Geis and Zwicky, 1971) discuss under the
label of INVITED INFERENCE. What they observe is the
tendency to read conditionals as biconditionals. For ex-
ample, If you mow my lawn I will give you $5 is usually
interpreted as I will give you $5 if and only if you mow my
lawn. Invited inferences may be explicitly cancelled. as
in (17), and they do not even arise in contexts where they
would conflict with what is known: Firms were allowed
to earn more than they did earn. Obviously, firms did not
earn more than they earned. No invited inference in this
case.
The phenomenon of invited inferences is much more
prevalent than has been recognized and it has not been
systematically studied except for SCALAR IMPLICA-
TURES for which there is a vast literature.5

3 Phrasal implicatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995444444445">
There is a large class of multiword constructions that are
semantically similar to the single verbs in Tables 1 and 2.
We call them PHRASAL IMPLICATIVES. They are com-
posed of a transitive verb such as have, make, take and
use, and a noun phrase headed by a noun such as attempt,
effort and opportunity that can take sentential comple-
ments. The “implicative signature” of such a phrase de-
pends both on the type of verb and the type of the noun.
We organize the presentation by the nouns.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964153">
3.1 attempt, effort, trouble, initiative
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99801325">
In the case of attempt the relation between a single verb
implicative and a phrasal one is obvious. For example,
attempt to X and make an attempt to X are virtually syn-
onymous.6
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97353775">
(18) a. Kim didn’t attempt to hide her feelings.
b. Kim didn’t make any attempt to hide her feel-
ings.
c. Kim made no effort to hide her feelings.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865166666667">
All the examples in (18) entail that Kim did not hide her
feelings. The affirmative versions of these sentences are
non-committal with respect to the complement clause.
Attempts and efforts can fail. Consequently, attempt to X,
make an attempt to X and make an effort to X are all −−
implicatives like allow NP to X in Table 2. The phrasal
version provides more ways to express negation than the
simple verb. It can be expressed by the determiner as in
(18c).
Another way to bring about a negative entailment in
this construction is to indicate by an adjective such as
futile that an attempt was made but it failed.

6We assume here that the infinitival clause is syntactically
a complement to the noun. In (18b), (18c) and in all the later
examples in this section there is an alternative syntactic anal-
ysis under which the to-complement expresses a purpose. In
that sense it does not modify the noun but the verb. The pur-
pose clause could be fronted separately, as in To hide her feel-
ings, Kim turned away. Purpose clauses are non-committal as
to whether the intended purpose was achieved.

<bodyText confidence="0.91896815">
Conversely, make a successful attempt to X entails that
X came about. Attempts can be described as bungled,
defeated, foiled, etc. that all yield a negative entailment
for the complement.
Complement taking nouns tend to occur with specific
verbs. Attempt can appear with have, make and take but
make is by far the most common collocate verb for this
noun. Semantically have/make/take an attempt to X are
all −− implicatives.
The choice of the collocate verb makes a difference
for many other nouns. In particular, make an effort to X
is a −− implicative but take an effort to X is a two-way
implicative. It has the signature + +  |− − as illustrated
in (20).
(20) a. He took an effort to bring me to the butterfly
garden.
b. She took no effort to dress in style.
In these examples take an effort to X is an equi-
construction. They are in contrast with the take an effort
sentences in (21).

<listItem confidence="0.7989155">

to infringe copyright.
b. It took no effort to unscrew the bolt.
c. Did it take an effort to be so clever?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983706666666667">
The examples in (21) do not contain phrasal implicatives,
they have an extraposed complement clause. Extraposi-
tion is a factive construction. The extraposed infinitival
clauses in (21) are presupposed.
The nouns trouble and initiative are like effort in that
they form a + +  |− − implicative phrase with take.
(22) a. She took the trouble to iron all the clothes.
b. Napoleon didn’t take the trouble to study the
country he was going to invade.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998318">
3.2 opportunity, chance, occasion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.915267278688525">
The phrase take the/an opportunity to X is a two-way ++
|−− implicative whereas have the/an opportunity to X is
only a −− implicative. (23a) entails that Kim expressed
her feelings, (23b) entails the opposite.
(23) a. Kim took the opportunity to express her feel-
ings.
b. Kim didn’t take the opportunity to express her
feelings.
Replacing took by have as in (24) takes away the pos-
itive entailment. (24a) is non-commital with respect to
the veridicality of the complement, (24b) has the same
negative entailment as (23b).
(24) a. Kim had the opportunity to express her feelings.
b. Kim didn’t have the opportunity to express her
feelings.
In (24) one could substitute get for have as getting some-
thing entails having it and not getting something entails
not having it. The substitution of lack or miss or lose for
have in (24) turns the −− implicative into a +− implica-
tive. In (25) we get a negative entailment in the affirma-
tive and no entailment under negation.
(25) a. The Belarusians lacked the opportunity to create
a distinctive national identity.
b. I didn’t lack the opportunity to engage in a rela-
tionship, I just felt no desire to.
There are several verbs that can substitute for take in (23)
without changing the entailments. They include more de-
scriptive synonyms for take such as seize, grab and snap.
There is also another family of verbs, use, utilize, exploit
and expend, that yield a two-way + +  |− − implicative
phrase with the/an opportunity to X.
(26) a. Randy used the opportunity to toot his own
horn.
b. Randy didn’t use the opportunity to toot his own
horn.
Here use could be replaced by make use of, itself a + +
 |− − implicative phrase.
Another class of verbs that yield implicative construc-
tions with the/a opportunity to X consists of lose, miss,
squander and waste that entail either not having or not
using an opportunity.
(27) a. Mr. Spitzer wasted the opportunity to drive a
harder bargain.
b. Galileo did not waste the opportunity to aim a
funny mock-syllogism at Grassi’s flying eggs.
Although WordNet classifies the verb waste as a hyponym
of the verb use, the two constructions, use the opportu-
nity to X and waste the opportunity to X, have opposite
entailment signatures. (27a) entails that Spitzer did not
drive a harder bargain. Replacing waste by did not use
in (27a) yields the same entailment as the original: he
didn’t. Similarly, (27b) entails that Galileo aimed a mock
syllogism at this opponent but replacing waste by use in
(27b) entails that he did not do that. In other words, use
the/an opportunity to X is a + +  |− − implicative, but
waste the/an opportunity to X is a + −  |− + implicative
construction.
Table 3 below summarizes the observations in this sec-
tion. HAVE stands for have and get; LACK for lack, miss,
give up, throw away and discard; TAKE for take, seize,

Wasting no time to X in the sense of ‘quickly do X’ is an
idiomatic use of waste. The examples in (30) do not mean
the opposite if the negation is removed. To express the
idea opposite to (30b), for example, you have to resort to
another idiom, Madonna took her time to move on to her
next single, it is not correct to say that she wasted time.

forward ++|−− implicative construction, have the time

We classify have the ability to X as a −− implicative and

Table 4: Implicative signatures for verb-noun colloca-
tions
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999479">
This table lists the implicative signatures of over three
hundred phrasal implicative verb-noun collocations. On
the level of surface strings the number of constructions is
of course much larger because of different tenses for the
verb and the many ways of fleshing a noun into a noun
phrase. For example, the verb waste expands to wasted,
has wasted, did not waste, etc. The noun chance expands
to a chanche, the chance, his chance, her last chance, etc.
The verb-noun collocations are publicly available.7 It
is a much larger class than the simple implicatives dis-
cussed in Section 2 but it is not complete. From a lin-
guistic point of view finding all the specimens is not im-
portant if the conceptual classification is done correctly.
For computational applications completeness does mat-
ter. We plan to continue to expand the list in the near
future.
The noun and verb classes discussed in Section 3 con-
tain items that are not together in any WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) SYNSET class. For example, acquit, fulfill, meet,
and perform are interchangeable in sentences such as

(37) a. He conscientiously acquitted his duty to inform
and educate the Court.
b. He fulfilled his duty to cremate his dead
brother’s body.
c. The officer met his duty to investigate and had
probable cause to arrest Kim.
As far as WordNet is concerned, the verbs acquit, ful-
fill, meet, and perform are totally unrelated. Neverthe-
less they constitute an equivalence class for this particular
phrasal implicative collocation, the MEET OBLIGATION
to X construction.
The same holds for the noun classes in Section 3. The
class in 3.5 includes chutzpah and foresight. Substituting
foresight for chutzpah in (33a) would retain the entail-
ment, that Julie asked the meter maid for a quarter, but it
would bring in a different presupposition.
Some computational systems already take advantage
of the semantic classification of simple and phrasal im-
plicatives. PARC’s Bridge system (Nairn et al., 2006) im-
plements the simple implicatives discussed in Section 2.
A few of the phrasal implicatives discussed in Section 3
have also been implemented in Bridge (Pichotta, 2008).
The NatLog system (MacCartney, 2009) implements the
same simple implicatives as Bridge but in a different way.
But neither Bridge nor NatLog does anything with pre-
suppositions. NatLog takes (1b), Kim forgot to resched-
ule the meeting, as a paraphrase of what it entails, Kim
did not reschedule the meeting, Bridge doesn’t. But nei-
ther system recognizes the presupposition of intent that
comes with the construction forget to X.
One area that remains to be systematically explored is
the complements of adjectives. It is known that there are
factive adjectives such as strange, as in It is strange that
Federer has never suffered a major injury, and two-way
implicative adjectives such as lucky, as in He was lucky to
break even, and phrasal adjective ++|−− constructions
such as see (it) fit to X, as in He saw fit to laugh and sneer
at us.
Another unexplored topic is phrasal factives such as
make pretense to X that is counterfactive, a paraphrase of
pretend to X.
We will address these issues in future work with the
Language and Natural Reasoning group at CSLI.8

There are two major types of implicative constructions. TWO-WAY IMPLICATIVES like forget to and remember to yield an entailment both in positive and negative contexts, ONE-WAY IMPLICATIVES yield an entailment only under one polarity.

The first sign stands for the polarity of the embedding context, the second sign for the polarity of the entailment. We code the verb remember to as + + |− − because in a positive context remember to X yields a positive entailment about X, ++, and the opposite, −−, in a negative context. There are two major types of implicative constructions.
