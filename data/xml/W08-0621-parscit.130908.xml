We developed a temporal annotation schema
that provides a structured method to capture
contextual and temporal features of clinical
conditions found in clinical reports. In this
poster we describe the elements of the annota-
tion schema and provide results of an initial
annotation study on a document set compris-
ing six different types of clinical reports.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989103125">
Distinguishing between historical and recent con-
ditions is important for most tasks involving re-
trieval of patients or extraction of information from
textual clinical records. Various approaches can be
used to determine whether a condition is historical
or recent. Chapman et al. (2007) developed an al-
gorithm called ConText that uses trigger terms like
“history” to predict whether a condition is histori-
cal. Studies of ConText show that this approach is
inadequate for determining whether a condition is
historical, achieving recall of 67% and precision
74% on emergency department reports. Temporal
modeling methods commonly reason about the
temporality of an event with respect to absolute
time and other temporally related events (Zhou et
al., 2006; Chambers et al., 2007). Knowing the
relative or absolute time the condition occurred can
be useful in determining whether the condition is
historical. However, we hypothesize that many
clinical conditions in clinical reports are not modi-
fied by explicit temporal references.
To test this hypothesis and explore other types
of information that may be useful in automatically
distinguishing historical from recent clinical condi-
tions in dictated clinical records, we developed a
temporal annotation schema that accounts for ex-
plicit temporal expressions, temporal trigger terms,
and clinical reporting acts described in reports.
Three annotators applied the schema to six types of
reports. We measured inter-annotator agreement
scores and obtained prevalence and distribution
figures for the three annotation types.

2 Methods
2.1 Dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993925">
Our dataset is comprised of 24 clinical reports of
six types dictated at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center during 2007: discharge summaries,
surgical pathology, radiology, echocardiograms,
operative gastrointestinal, and emergency depart-
ment reports. A physician pre-annotated the 518
clinical conditions in the reports and marked each
one as recent or historical.
We developed our annotation schema using one
of each report type (six reports). Annotators
(authors HH, DM and WC) annotated the remain-
ing 18 reports as described below.

2.2 Annotation Schema
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746588235294">
For our temporal annotation study, each pre-
annotated clinical condition was annotated with
three types of information: temporal expression,
trigger term, and clinical reporting act.
The set of temporal expressions (TEs) is taken
from Zhou et al. (2006) and includes categories
such as DATE AND TIME for explicit TEs and KEY
EVENTS for TEs relative to significant clinical
events. A given clinical condition is annotated with
the category of the TE it is modified by. For exam-
ple, in the sentence “The stroke occurred on
1/5/2000”, the condition “stroke” is annotated with
category DATE AND TIME. There is also a category
NO TEMPORAL EXPRESSION for annotating condi-
tions that are not linked to a TE.
Trigger terms (TTs) are explicit signals (words
and phrases) in text other than TEs that indicate

whether a condition is recent or historical (Chap-
man et al., 2007). If a condition co-occurs with a
TT, it is annotated with TRIGGER: YES. For exam-
ple, “pneumonia” in the sentence “Films indicate
pneumonia, which is new for this patient” is anno-
tated as TRIGGER: YES because “new” is a TT.
Error analyses of our previous studies indicate
that the context in which a condition is mentioned
in a report is potentially useful for prediction of a
condition as recent or historical. Clinical reports
consist of statements that group into segments ac-
cording to the clinical reporting act (CRA) they
describe, such as noting a past history and consid-
ering a diagnosis. CRAs are tightly correlated with
report sections; however, sections are not consis-
tent, and different CRAs can occur within a single
section. We distinguish 16 CRAs. Each clinical
condition is annotated with one CRA. For exam-
ple, the condition “smoker” in the sentence “She
was a smoker” is annotated SOCIAL HISTORY.

2.3 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998715">
To establish the level of inter-annotator agreement,
we iteratively annotated groups of six reports (one
of each type). After each iteration, we refined our
annotation schema and guidelines. We analyzed
annotations, overall and by report type, in the fol-
lowing way: 1) calculate inter-annotator kappa
score, 2) measure prevalence of TT and TE catego-
ries, and 3) observe distribution of CRAs.

3 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989863">
As shown in figure 1, average inter-annotator
scores as measured by Cohen&apos;s kappa for TE, TT,
and CRA (.68, .82 and .72 respectively) reached
acceptable levels after three iterations and are ex-
pected to rise further with increased annotation
experience and understanding of the guidelines.
Table 1 shows the prevalence of TEs and TTs
across six report types, where prevalence is defined
as the frequency of TE or TT found in a given re-
port. Use of TEs across report types ranged from
0% to 52% whereas TTs were found less often at
0% to 34% by report genre. Table 2 plots the cor-
relation between the CRA assigned to a clinical
condition and the condition&apos;s classification as re-
cent or historical. We found that there is a strong
correlation for the most commonly occurring clini-
cal reporting acts (PH, PR, and PO). We are there-
fore optimistic that CRAs can serve as an
informative feature for a statistical recent/historical
classifier.

<bodyText confidence="0.999984545454546">
The finding that many conditions are associated
with neither a TE nor a TT and study of ConText’s
limitations with such categories at the scope of the
sentence suggests that additional features are nec-
essary to discern a condition as recent or historical.
Whereas temporality in discourse may follow a
sequential chronology as narrative unfolds, refer-
ences to past instances within clinical text are not
easily resolved. We are optimistic that CRAs may
help this issue and will focus our study to evaluate
whether these three features are sufficient together.
