This paper discusses research on distin-
guishing word meanings in the context of
information retrieval systems. We conduc-
ted experiments with three sources of evid-
ence for making these distinctions: mor-
phology, part-of-speech, and phrases. We
have focused on the distinction between
homonymy and polysemy (unrelated vs. re-
lated meanings). Our results support the
need to distinguish homonymy and poly-
semy. We found: 1) grouping morpholo-
gical variants makes a significant improve-
ment in retrieval performance, 2) that more
than half of all words in a dictionary that
differ in part-of-speech are related in mean-
ing, and 3) that it is crucial to assign credit
to the component words of a phrase. These
experiments provide a better understanding
of word-based methods, and suggest where
natural language processing can provide
further improvements in retrieval perform-
arce.

Lexical ambiguity is a fundamental problem in nat-

the problem, or about the impact that it has on spe-
cific applications. We report on our experiments to

senses (morphology, part of speech, and phrases) as
multiple sources of evidence.&apos; Experiments were de-
signed to test each source of evidence independently,
and to identify areas of interaction. Our hypothesis
is:
Hypothesis 1 Resolving lexical ambiguity will lead
to an improvement in retrieval performance.
There are many issues involved in determining
how word senses should be used in information re-
trieval. The most basic issue is one of identity â€”
what is a word sense? In previous work, research-
ers have usually made distinctions based on their
intuition. This is not satisfactory for two reasons.
First, it is difficult to scale up; researchers have gen-
erally focused on only two or three words. Second,
they have used very coarse grained distinctions (e.g..
&apos;river bank&apos; v. &apos;commercial bank&apos;). In practice it is
often difficult to determine how many senses a word
should have, and meanings are often related (Kilgar-
riff 91).
A related issue is sense granularity. Dictionar-
ies often make very fine distinctions between word
meanings, and it isn&apos;t clear whether these distinc-
tions are important in the context of a particular
application. For example, the sentence They danced
across the room is ambiguous with respect to the
word dance. It can be paraphrased as They were
across the room and they were dancing, or as They
crossed the room as they danced. The sentence is
not ambiguous in Romance languages, and can only
have the former meaning. Machine translation sys-
tems therefore need to be aware of this ambiguity and
translate the sentence appropriately. This is a sys-
tematic class of ambiguity, and applies to all -verbs
of translatory motion.&apos; (e.g., The bottle floated under
the bridge will exhibit the same distinction (Talmy
85)). Such distinctions are unlikely to have an im-
pact on information retrieval. However, there are
&apos;We used the Longman Dictionary as our source of
information about word senses (Procter 78).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996627">

<bodyText confidence="0.999922942857143">
also distinctions that are important in information
retrieval that are unlikely to be important in ma-
chine translation. For example. the word west can
be used in the context the East versus the West, or in
the context West Germany. These two senses were
found to provide a good separation between relevant
and non-relevant documents, but the distinction is
probably not important for machine translation. It
is likely that different applications will require differ-
ent types of distinctions, and the type of distinctions
required in information retrieval is an open question.
Finally, there are questions about how word senses
should be used in a retrieval system. In general,
word senses should be used to supplement word-
based indexing rather than indexing on word senses
alone. This is because of the uncertainty involved
with sense representation, and the degree to which
we can identify a particular sense with the use of a
word in context. If we replace words with senses, we
are making an assertion that we are very certain that
the replacement does not lose any of the information
important in making relevance judgments, and that
the sense we are choosing for a word is in fact cor-
rect. Both of these are problematic. Until more is
learned about sense distinctions, and until very ac-
curate methods are developed for identifying senses,
it is probably best to adopt a more conservative ap-
proach (i.e., uses senses as a supplement to word-
based indexing).
The following section will provide an overview of
lexical ambiguity and information retrieval. This
will be followed by a discussion of our experiments.
The paper will conclude with a summary of what has
been accomplished, and what work remains for the
future.

2 Lexical Ambiguity and
Information Retrieval
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997027">
2.1 Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977452380952">
Many retrieval systems represent documents and
queries by the words they contain. There are two
problems with using words to represent the content
of documents. The first problem is that words are
ambiguous, and this ambiguity can cause documents
to be retrieved that are not relevant. Consider the
following description of a search that was performed
using the keyword &apos;AIDS&apos;:
Unfortunately, not all 34 [references] were
about AIDS, the disease. The references
included &amp;quot;two helpful aids during the first
three months after total hip replacement&amp;quot;,
and &amp;quot;aids in diagnosing abnormal voiding
patterns&amp;quot;. (Helm 83)
One response to this problem is to use phrases
to reduce ambiguity (e.g., specifying &apos;hearing aids&apos;
if that is the desired sense). It is not always pos-
sible, however, to provide phrases in which the word
occurs only with the desired sense. In addition. the
requirement for phrases imposes a significant burden
on the user.
The second problem is that a document can be
relevant even though it does not use the same words
as those that are provided in the query. The user
is generally not interested in retrieving documents
with exactly the same words, but with the concepts
that those words represent. Retrieval systems ad-
dress this problem by expanding the query words us-
ing related words from a thesaurus (Salton and Mc-
Gill 83). The relationships described in a thesaurus,
however, are really between word senses rather than
words. For example, the word &apos;term&apos; could be syn-
onymous with &apos;word&apos; (as in a vocabulary term), &apos;sen-
tence&apos; (as in a prison term), or &apos;condition&apos; (as in
&apos;terms of agreement&apos;). If we expand the query with
words from a thesaurus, we must be careful to use
the right senses of those words. We not only have
to know the sense of the word in the query (in this
example, the sense of the word &apos;term&apos;), but the sense
of the word that is being used to augment it (e.g., the
appropriate sense of the word &apos;sentence&apos;) (Chodorow
et al 88).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99978">
2.2 Types of Lexical Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99952025">
Lexical ambiguity can be divided into homonymy
and polysemy, depending on whether or not the
meanings are related. The bark of a dog versus the
bark of a tree is an example of homonymy; review as
a noun and as a verb is an example of polysemy.
The distinction between homonymy and polysemy
is central. Homonymy is important because it sep-
arates unrelated concepts. If we have a query about
&apos;AIDS&apos; (the disease), and a document contains &apos;aids&apos;
in the sense of a hearing aid, then the word aids
should not contribute to our belief that the docu-
ment is relevant to the query. Polysemy is important
because the related senses constitute a partial repres-
entation of the overall concept. If we fail to group
related senses, it is as if we are ignoring some of the
occurrences of a query word in a document. So for
example, if we are distinguishing words by part-of-
speech, and the query contains &apos;diabetic&apos; as a noun,
the retrieval system will exclude instances in which
&apos;diabetic&apos; occurs as an adjective unless we recognize
that the noun and adjective senses for that word are
related and group them together.
Although there is a theoretical distinction between
homonymy and polysemy, it is not always easy to tell

them apart in practice. What determines whether
the senses are related? Dictionaries group senses
based on part-of-speech and etymology, but as illus-
trated by the word review, senses can be related even
though they differ in syntactic category. Senses may
also be related etymologically, but be perceived as
distinct at the present time (e.g.. the &apos;cardinal&apos; of a
church and &apos;cardinal&apos; numbers are etymologically re-
lated). We investigated several methods to identify
related senses both across part of speech and within
a single homograph, and these will be described in
more detail in Section 3.2.1.

3 Experiments on Word-Sense
Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999299">
3.1 Preliminary Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897">
Our initial experiments were designed to investigate
the following two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2 Word senses provide an effective
separation between relevant and non-relevant docu-
ments.
As we saw earlier in the paper, it is possible for
a query about &apos;AIDS&apos; the disease to retrieve docu-
ments about &apos;hearing aids&apos;. But to what extent are
such inappropriate matches associated with relevance
judgments? This hypothesis predicts that sense mis-
matches will be more likely to appear in documents
that are not relevant than in those that are relevant.
Hypothesis 3 Even a small domain-specific collec-
tion of documents exhibits a significant degree of lex-
ical ambiguity.
Little quantitative data is available about lexical
ambiguity, and such data as is available is often con-
fined to only a small number of words. In addition,
it is generally assumed that lexical ambiguity does
not occur very often in domain-specific text. This
hypothesis was tested by quantifying the ambiguity
for a large number of words in such a collection, and
challenging the assumption that ambiguity does not
occur very often.
To investigate these hypotheses we conducted ex-
periments with two standard test collections, one
consisting of titles and abstracts in Computer Sci-
ence, and the other consisting of short articles from
Time magazine.
The first experiment was concerned with determ-
ining how often sense mismatches occur between
a query and a document, and whether these mis-
matches indicate that the document is not relevant.
To test this hypothesis we manually identified the
senses of the words in the queries for two collec-
tions (Computer Science and Time). These words
were then manually checked against the words they
matched in the top ten ranked documents for each
query (the ranking was produced using a probabil-
istic retrieval system). The number of sense mis-
matches was then computed, and the mismatches in
the relevant documents were identified.
The second experiment involved quantifying the
degree of ambiguity found in the test collections. We
manually examined the word tokens in the corpus for
each query word, and estimated the distribution of
the senses. The number of word types with more
than one meaning was determined. Because of the
volume of data analysis, only one collection was ex-
amined (Computer Science), and the distribution of
senses was only coarsely estimated: there were ap-
proximately 300 unique query words, and they con-
stituted 35,000 tokens in the corpus.
These experiments provided strong support for
Hypotheses 2 and 3, Word meanings are highly cor-
related with relevance judgements, and the corpus
study showed that there is a high degree of lexical
ambiguity even in a small collection of scientific text
(over 40% of the query words were found to be am-
biguous in the corpus). These experiments provided
a clear indication of the potential of word mean-
ings to improve the performance of a retrieval sys-
tem. The experiments are described in more detail
in (Krovetz and Croft 92).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.839759">
3.2 Experiments with different sources of
evidence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999398125">
The next set of experiments were concerned with
determining the effectiveness of different sources
of evidence for distinguishing word senses. We
were also interested in the extent with which a
difference in form corresponded to a difference in
meaning. For example, words can differ in mor-
phology (authorize/authorized), or part-of-speech
(diabetic [noun]/diabetic [adj]), or in their abil-
ity to appear in a phrase (database/data base).
They can also exhibit such differences, but rep-
resent different concepts, such as author/authorize.
sink[nounl/sink[verbb or stone wall/stonewall. Our
default assumption was that a difference in form is
associated with a difference in meaning unless we
could establish that the different word forms were
related.

3.2.1 Linking related word meanings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999724">
We investigated two approaches for relating senses
with respect to morphology and part of speech: 1)
exploiting the presence of a variant of a term within
its dictionary definition. and 2) using the overlap of
the words in the definitions of suspected variants.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993545">

<bodyText confidence="0.999980657534246">
For example, liable appears within the definition of
liability, and this is used as evidence that those words
are related. Similarly, flat as a noun is defined as &apos;a
flat tire&apos;, and the presence of the word in its own
definition, but with a different part of speech, is
taken as evidence that the noun and adjective mean-
ings are related. We can also compute the overlap
between the definitions of liable and liability, and
if they have a significant number of words in com-
mon then that is evidence that those meanings are
related. These two strategies could potentially be
used for phrases as well, but phrases are one of the
areas where dictionaries are incomplete, and other
methods are needed for determining when phrases
are related. We will discuss this in Section 3.2.4.
We conducted experiments to determine the effect-
iveness of the two methods for linking word senses.
In the first experiment we investigated the perform-
ance of a part-of-speech tagger for identifying the
related forms. These related forms (e.g., fiat as a
noun and an adjective) are referred to as instances of
zero-affix morphology, or functional shift (Marchand
63). We first tagged all definitions in the dictionary
for words that began with the letter &apos;W&apos;. This pro-
duced a list of 209 words that appeared in their own
definitions with a different part of speech. However,
we found that only 51 (24%) were actual cases of
related meanings. This low success rate was almost
entirely due to tagging error. That is, we had a false
positive rate of 76% because the tagger indicated the
wrong part of speech. We conducted a failure ana-
lysis and it indicated that 91% the errors occurred in
idiomatic expressions (45 instances) or example sen-
tences associated with the definitions (98 instances).
We therefore omitted idiomatic senses and example
sentences from further processing and tagged the
rest of the dictionary.&apos;
The result of this experiment is that the dictionary
contains at least 1726 senses in which the headword
was mentioned, but with a different part of speech,
of which 1.566 were in fact related (90.7%). We ana-
lyzed the distribution of the connections, and this is
given in Table 1 (n = 1566).
However, Table 1 does not include cases in which
the word appears in its definition, but in an inflected
form. For example, &apos;cook&apos; as a noun is defined as
&apos;a person who prepares and cooks food&apos;. Unless we
recognize the inflected form, we will not capture all of
the instances. We therefore repeated the procedure,
but allowing for inflectional variants. The result is
given in Table 2 (n = 1054).
We also conducted an experiment to determine
the effectiveness of capturing related senses via word
overlap. The result is that if the definitions for the
root and variant had two or more words in common,3
93% of the pairs were semantically related. However,
of the sense-pairs that were actually related, two-
thirds had only one word in common. We found
that 65% of the sense-pairs with one word in com-
mon were related. Having only one word in common
between senses is very weak evidence that the senses
are related, and it is not surprising that there is a
greater degree of error.
The two experiments, tagging and word overlap,
were found to be to be highly effective once the com-
mon causes of error were removed. In the case of
tagging the error was due to idiomatic senses and ex-
ample sentences, and in the case of word overlap the
error was links due to a single word in common. Both
methods have approximately a 90% success rate in
pairing the senses of morphological variants if those
problems are removed. The next section will discuss
our experiments with morphology.

3.2.2 Experiments with Morphology
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985270967741935">
We conducted several experiments to determine
the impact of grouping morphological variants on
retrieval performance. These experiments are de-
scribed in detail in (Krovetz 93), so we will only
summarize them here.
Our experiments compared a baseline (no stem-
ming) against several different morphology routines:
1) a routine that grouped only inflectional variants
(plurals and tensed verb forms), 2) a routine that
grouped inflectional as well as derivational variants
(e.g., -ize, -ity), and 3) the Porter stemmer (Porter
80). These experiments were done with four different
test collections which varied in both size and subject
area. We found that there was a significant improve-
ment over the baseline performance from grouping
morphological variants.
Earlier experiments with morphology in IR did not
report improvements in performance (Harman 91).
We attribute these differences to the use of different
test collections, and in part to the use of different
retrieval systems. We found that the improvement
varies depending on the test collection, and that col-
lections that were made up of shorter documents were
more likely to improve. This is because morpholo-
gical variants can occur within the same document,
but they are less likely to do so in documents that
are short. By grouping morphological variants, we
are helping to improve access to the shorter docu-
ments. However, we also found improvements even

in a collection of legal documents which had an av-
erage length of more than 3000 words.
We also found it was very difficult to improve
retrieval performance over the performance of the
Porter stemmer, which does not use a lexicon. The
absence of a lexicon causes the Porter stemmer
to make errors by grouping morphological &amp;quot;false
friends&amp;quot; (e.g.. author/authority, or police/policy).
We found that there were three reasons why the
Porter stemmer improves performance despite such
groupings. The first two reasons are associated with
the heuristics used by the stemmer: 1) some word
forms will be grouped when one of the forms has
a combination of endings (e.g., -ization and -ize).
We empirically found that the word forms in these
groups are almost always related in meaning. 2) the
stemmer uses a constraint on the form of the res-
ulting stem based on a sequence of consonants and
vowels; we found that this constraint is surprisingly
effective at separating unrelated variants. The third
reason has to do with the nature of morphological
variants. We found that when a word form appears
to be a variant, it often is a variant. For example,
consider the grouping of police and policy. We ex-
amined all words in the dictionary in which a word
ended in &apos;y&apos;, and in which the &apos;y&apos; could be replaced
by *e&apos; and still yield a word in the dictionary. There
were 17:5 such words, but only 39 were clearly un-
related in meaning to the presumed root (i.e., cases
like policy/police). Of the 39 unrelated word pairs,
only 14 were grouped by the Porter stemmer because
of the consonant/vowel constraints. We also identi-
fied the morphological &amp;quot;false friends&amp;quot; for the 10 most
frequent suffixes. We found that out of 911 incorrect
word pairs, only 303 were grouped by the Porter
stemmer.
Finally, we found that conflating inflectional vari-
ants harmed the performance of about a third of
the queries. This is partially a result of the inter-
action between morphology and part-of-speech (e.g.,
a query that contains work in the sense of theoretical
work will be grouped with all of the variants asso-
ciated with the the verb - worked, working, works);
we note that some instances of works can be related
to the singular form work (although not necessarily
the right meaning of work), and some can be related
to the untensed verb form. Grouping inflectional
variants also harms retrieval performance because
of an overlap between inflected forms and uninflec-
ted forms (e.g., arms can occur as a reference to
weapons, or as an inflected form of arm). Conflat-
ing these forms has the effect of grouping unrelated
concepts, and thus increases the net ambiguity.
Our experiments with morphology support our at-
gument about distinguishing homonymy and poly-
semy. Grouping related morphological variants
makes a significant improvement in retrieval per-
formance. Morphological false friends (policy/police)
often provide a strong separation between relevant
and non-relevant documents (see (Krovetz and Croft
92)). There are no morphology routines that can
currently handle the problems we encountered with
inflectional variants, and it is likely that separating
related from unrelated forms will make further im-
provements in performance.

3.2.3 Experiments with Part of Speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976">
Relatively little attention has been paid in IR to
the differences in a word&apos;s part of speech. These
differences have been used to help identify phrases
(Dillon and Gray 83), and as a means of filtering
for word sense disambiguation (to only consider the
meanings of nouns (Voorhees 93)). To the best of our
knowledge the differences have never been examined
for distinguishing meanings within the context of IR.
The aim of our experiments was to determine how
well part of speech differences correlate with differ-
ences in word meanings, and to what extent the use
of meanings determined by these differences will af-
fect the performance of a retrieval system. We con-
ducted two sets of experiments, one concerned with
homonymy, and one concerned with polysemy. In
the first experiment the Church tagger was used to
identify part-of-speech of the words in documents
and queries. The collections were then indexed by
the word tagged with the part of speech (i.e., in-
stead of indexing &apos;book&apos;, we indexed &apos;book/noun&apos;
and &apos;book/verb&apos;).4 A baseline was established in
which all variants of a word were present in the
query, regardless of part of speech variation; the
baseline did not include any morphological variants
of the query words because we wanted to test the in-
teraction between morphology and part-of-speech in
a separate experiment. The baseline was then com-
pared against a version of the query in which all vari-
ations were eliminated except for the part of speech
that was correct (i.e., if the word was used as a noun
in the original query, all other variants were elimin-
ated). This constituted the experiment that tested
homonymy. We then identified words that were re-
lated in spite of a difference in part of speech; this
was based on the data that was produced by tagging
the dictionary (see Section 3.2.1). Another version of
the queries was constructed in which part of speech
variants were retained if the meaning was related,

4 In actuality, we indexed it with whatever tags were
used by the tagger; we are just using &apos;noun&apos; and &apos;verb&apos;
for purposes of illustration.

and this was compared to the previous version.
When we ran the experiments, we found that
performance decreased compared with the baseline.
However, we found many cases where the tagger was
incorrect.&apos; We were unable to determine whether
the results of the experiment were due to the incor-
rectness of the hypothesis being tested (that distinc-
tions in part of speech can lead to an improvement
in performance), or to the errors made by the tagger.
We also assumed that a difference in part-of-speech
would correspond to a difference in meaning. The
data in Table 1 and Table 2 shows that many words
are related in meaning despite a difference in part-
of-speech. Not all errors made by the tagger cause
decreases in retrieval performance, and we are in the
process of determining the error rate of the tagger on
those words in which part-of-speech differences are
also associated with a difference in concepts (e.g.,
novel as a noun and as an adjective).6

3.2.4 Experiments with Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999168927536232">
Phrases are an important and poorly understood
area of IR. They generally improve retrieval perform-
ance, but the improvements are not consistent. Most
research to date has focused on syntactic phrases,
in which words are grouped together because they
are in a specific syntactic relationship (Fagan 87),
(Smeaton and Van Rijsbergen 88). The research
in this section is concerned with a subset of these
phrases, namely those that are lexical. A lexical
phrase is a phrase that might be defined in a dic-
tionary, such as hot line or back end. Lexical phrases
can be distinguished from a phrases such as sanc-
tions against South Africa in that the meaning of a
lexical phrase cannot necessarily be determined from
the meaning of its parts.
Lexical phrases are generally made up of only two
or three words (overwhelmingly just two), and they
usually occur in a fixed order. The literature men-
tions examples such as blind venetians vs. venetian
blinds, or science library vs. library science, but
these are primarily just cute examples. It is very
rare that the order could be reversed to produce a
different concept.
Although dictionaries contain a large number of
phrasal entries, there are many lexical phrases that
are missing. These are typically proper nouns
(United States, Great Britain, United Nations) or
technical concepts (operating system, specific heat,
&apos;See (Krovetz 95) for more details about these errors.

due process. strict liability). We manually identified
the lexical phrases in four different test collections
(the phrases were based on our judgement). and we
found that 92 out of 120 phrases (77%) were not
found in the Longman dictionary. A breakdown of
the phrases is given in (Krovetz 95).
For the phrase experiment we not only had to
identify the lexical phrases, we also had to identify
any related forms, such as database/data base. This
was done via brute force â€” a program simply con-
catenated every adjacent word in the database. and
if it was also a single word in the collection it prin-
ted out the pair. We tested this with the Computer
Science and Time collections, and used those results
to develop an exception list for filtering the pairs
(e.g., do not consider &apos;special ties/specialties&apos;). We
represented the phrases using a proximity operator&apos;
and tried several experiments to include the related
form when it was found in the corpus.
We found that retrieval performance decreased for
118 out of 120 phrases. A failure analysis indic-
ated that this was due to the need to assign partial
credit to individual words of a phrase. The com-
ponent words were always related to the meaning of
the compound as a whole (e.g., Britain and Great
Britain).
We also found that most of the instances of
open/closed compounds (e.g., database&apos; data base)
were related. Cases like &apos;stone wall/stonewall&apos; or
&apos;bottle neck/bottleneck&apos; are infrequent. The effect on
performance of grouping the compounds is related to
the relative distribution of the open and closed forms.
Database! data base occurred in about a 50/50 distri-
bution, and the queries in which they occurred were
significantly improved when the related form was in-
cluded.

3.2.5 Interactions between Sources of
Evidence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977743083333333">
We found many interactions between the different
sources of evidence. The most striking is the inter-
action between phrases and morphology. We found
that the use of phrases acts as a filter for the group-
ing of morphological variants. Errors in morphology
generally do not hurt performance within the restric-
ted context. For example, the Porter stemmer will
reduce department to depart, but this has no effect
in the context of the phrase &apos;Justice department&apos;.
&apos;The proximity operator specifies that the query
words must be adjacent and in order, or occur within
a specific number of words of each other.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982833333333">
Most of the research on lexical ambiguity has not
been done in the context of an application. We
have conducted experiments with hundreds of unique
query words, and tens of thousands of word occur-
rences. The research described in this paper is one of
the largest studies ever done. We have examined the
lexicon as a whole, and focused on the distinction
between homonymy and polysemy. Other research
on resolving lexical ambiguity for IR (e.g., (Sander-
son 94) and (Voorhees 93)) does not take this dis-
tinction into account.
Our research supports the argument that it is im-
portant to distinguish homonymy and polysemy. We
have shown that natural language processing res-
ults in an improvement in retrieval performance (via
grouping related morphological variants), and our
experiments suggest where further improvements can
be made. We have also provided an explanation for
the performance of the Porter stemmer, and shown
it is surprisingly effective at distinguishing variant
word forms that are unrelated in meaning. The ex-
periment with part-of-speech tagging also high-
lighted the importance of polysemy; more than half
of all words in the dictionary that differ in part of
speech are also related in meaning. Finally, our ex-
periments with lexical phrases show that it is crucial
to assign partial credit to the component words of
a phrase. Our experiment with open/closed com-
pounds indicated that these forms are almost always
related in meaning.
The experiment with part-of-speech tagging in-
dicated that taggers make a number of errors, and
our current work is concerned with identifying those
words in which a difference in part of speech is as-
sociated with a difference in meaning (e.g., train as
a noun and as a verb). The words that exhibit such
differences are likely to affect retrieval performance.
We are also examining lexical phrases to decide how
to assign partial credit to the component words.
This work will give us a better idea of how language
processing can provide further improvements in IR,
and a better understanding of language in general.

<abstract confidence="0.99783052173913">This paper discusses research on distinguishing word meanings in the context of information retrieval systems. We conducted experiments with three sources of evidence for making these distinctions: morphology, part-of-speech, and phrases. We have focused on the distinction between homonymy and polysemy (unrelated vs. related meanings). Our results support the need to distinguish homonymy and polysemy. We found: 1) grouping morphological variants makes a significant improvement in retrieval performance, 2) that more than half of all words in a dictionary that differ in part-of-speech are related in meaning, and 3) that it is crucial to assign credit to the component words of a phrase. These experiments provide a better understanding of word-based methods, and suggest where natural language processing can provide further improvements in retrieval performarce.</abstract>
