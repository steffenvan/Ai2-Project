<bodyText confidence="0.9996595">
The technology of finite-state transduc-
ers is implemented to recognize, lem-
matize and tag composite tenses in Ser-
bian in a way that connects the auxiliary
and main verb. The suggested approach
uses a morphological electronic dictio-
nary of simple words and appropriate lo-
cal grammars.

The lemmatization of verb forms is, in general, re-
duced to the assignment of a predefined canonical
form to simple verb forms. In Serbian/Croatian
this canonical form is the infinitive. This princi-
ple can be successfully applied, under certain con-
straints, to other inflective words as well, namely
to the lemmatization of nouns and adjectives.
However, the lemmatization of verb forms, viewed
as the establishment of a relation between tex-
tual word and lexical word and the assignment
of values of morphological categories that con-
nect them, has many deficiencies (Gross, 1998-
1999), since composite verbs, though they repre-
sent conjugated forms of a verb, cannot be recog-
nized within the same framework. For instance,
the string video ga je (Engl. he saw him) will
be tagged as an active past participle of the verb
videti in singular masculine form, followed by a
clitic pronoun ga, followed by the third person
present of the auxiliary verb jesam. Comparing
this string with the corresponding string in present
tense vidi ga (Engl. he sees him) it can be clearly
observed that the form video in the first example
should be tagged as a third person perfect of the
verb videti with the additional information that the
form is of masculine gender.
One of the reasons for which the composite
tenses are not recognized during the morpholog-
ical analysis is due to the inserts that separate the
auxiliary verb form from the form of the main
verb. The distance between these two forms can
be considerable, measured either with the num-
ber of inserted words or with the complexity of
the syntactic structure of the inserted word se-
quence. Further reasons to postpone the composite
tense recognition until the syntactic analysis can
be found in the so-called free word order and in
the ambiguities of auxiliary and main verb forms
(Popovi´c, 1997)
On the other hand, the consequences of inade-
quate recognition of composite verbs during mor-
phological analysis are manifold. First of all, the
problem of the recognition of composite tenses is
thus pushed toward the syntactic analysis and for
that reason the process of lemmatization can be
accomplished only partially on the morphological
level, while a considerable number of ambigui-
ties cannot be eliminated during the morphologi-
cal analysis.
In this article we will present the problem of
the recognition of composite active tenses in con-
temporary Serbian as well as one partial solution
that is based on the application of finite transduc-
ers. First we will describe a Serbian morpholog-
ical e-dictionary of simple verb forms (in section
2), in section 3 we will indicate the problems en-
countered in lemmatization based on simple verb
forms, and in section 4 we will present the struc-
ture of composite active verb tenses in Serbian and
one possibility to represent them by finite trans-
ducers. In the conclusion we will discuss the limi-
tations of this solution and will outline further de-
velopments.

2 E-dictionary of simple verb forms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998450333333334">
The morphological e-dictionary (DELAS) of Ser-
bian is being developed in the format described
in (Courtois, 1990), (Vitas, 2000). Presently this
dictionary contains approximately 15,000 verb en-
tries, which corresponds to typical one-volume
Serbian/Croatian dictionaries. In this dictionary
each verb (with a few exceptions) is represented
by its infinitive form. For each verb, simple forms
of conjugation, given as character strings between
two consecutive separators, have been generated
together with possible values of their morphologi-
cal categories. This task has been accomplished by
using descriptions of different verb classes in the
form of regular expressions and their implementa-
tion by finite transducers incorporated in the IN-
TEX system (Silberztein, 1993). A part of a reg-
ular expression in the INTEX format of the trans-
ducer V122.fst is:

4zxem/:Pxs +
4zxi/:Yys +
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996344481481482">
So far, 339 transducers have been developed that
precisely describe the simple verb forms of con-
jugation, starting from the verbs’ infinitive forms.
For each verb, in addition to its verb forms, all the
inflected forms of the corresponding verbal noun
and passive past participle, if they exist, have been
generated as well. The area in DELAS dedicated
to the designation of syntactic and semantic char-
acteristics has been filled for each verb with its
basic features: aspect, reflexiveness, and transi-
tiveness. This dictionary contains verbs in both
ekavian and ijekavian pronunciation, which is also
marked in this area of the DELAS dictionary (Vi-
tas, 2001).
An example of a few entries in the DELAS dic-
tionary is:
pokazati,V122+Perf+Tr+Iref+Ref
pokazivati,V18+Impf+Tr+Iref+Ref
where, for instance, the tags +Perf+Tr+Iref+Ref
signify, respectively, that the verb pokazati (Engl.
to show) is perfective, transitive, and can, but need
not, be reflexive. The tag V122 signifies that the
conjugation of this verb is described by transducer
V122.fst. The simple verb forms described by this
transducer are: infinitive (W), present (P), aorist
(A), imperfect (I), imperative (Y), future (F), ac-
tive past participle (G), passive past participle (T),
present participle (S), and perfect participle (X).
An example of some of the 30 generated simple
forms for verb pokazati is:
pokaza,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:Ays:Azs
pokazacxe,pokazati.V122+Perf
+Tr+Iref+Ref:Fzs:Fzp
pokazala,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:Gsf:Gpn
pokazana,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:Tfs:Tnp
pokazati,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:W
pokazavsxi,pokazati.V122+Perf
+Tr+Iref+Ref:X
pokazxem,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:Pxs
pokazxi,pokazati.V122+Perf+Tr
+Iref+Ref:Yys
Proceeding from the information in morphologi-
cal e-dictionary and using the formalisms incorpo-
rated in the INTEX system it is possible to formu-
late complex queries on texts. In the initial phase
of text processing — the application of lexical re-
sources — each text string that occurs in some of
the applied dictionaries of the DELAF form is as-
signed one or more lexical entries with possible
grammatical categories. This enables the process-
ing of, among others, queries of the forms:
pokazati — matches all text strings that
literally coincide with the query string;
pokazati — matches all text strings to
which the lemma pokazati is assigned in the
dictionary;
pokazati:P —matches all text strings
that coincide with some form of the verb
pokazati in present tense (according to the
dictionary);
pokazati:Ps — matches all text
strings that coincide with some singular form
of the verb pokazati in present tense (regard-
less of person);
pokazati:G —matches all text strings
that coincide with some form of the active
past participle of the verb pokazati (regard-
less of number), etc.
The syntactic and semantic information associ-
ated to verb entries in DELAS can also be used to
express queries:
V-Aux:P —matches all text strings that
coincide with some present tense form of a
verb that is not auxiliary, etc.
Even more complex queries can be formulated
through local grammars (Roche, 1997).

3 Lemmatization of simple verb forms

<bodyText confidence="0.999819">
The recognition of simple verb forms has been
tested on several different texts. First we give
quantitative data for four texts, marked consec-
utively as R, P, K, and F that are described in
more details in Appendix A. Data about the length
of texts and frequencies of particular simple verb
forms (without disambiguation) is given in Table
1. N in the Table denotes the number of simple
forms (and different simple forms), that are se-
quences of alphabetic characters between two sep-
arators.
Verb forms that participate in the produc-
tion of composite tenses, active past participle
( V:G ) and infinitive ( V:W ) for active
tenses, and passive past participle ( V:T )
for passive tenses represent over a quarter of all

From the data in Table 2 it can be concluded that
auxiliary verb forms that participate in composite
tense formation represent the dominant usage of
these verbs. By comparison of data from Tables 1
and 2 one can see that tagging by e-dictionary does
not give the proper insight into the way a particular
verb is realized in the text.
In the process of lemmatization and tagging of a
Serbian text a high degree of ambiguity of simple
V — matches all text strings that coincide
with some simple verb form;

verb forms is prominent. The origins of the ambi-
guity of strings that can potentially be verb forms
can be various:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980961421052632">
(a) A string can represent several different re-
alizations of morphological categories of the
same verb, e.g. the string peva is at the same
time the third person singular of the present
tense and the second and third person singular
of the aorist tense of the verb pevati (Engl. to
sing), while the clitic form ´ce is the third per-
son singular and plural of the present tense of
the auxiliary verb hteti (Engl. to wish).
(b) A string can represent forms of different verbs.
Such is the case with string ˇzeli that represents
the third person singular of the present tense of
the verb ˇzeleti (Engl. to desire) and the plural
masculine gender of the active past participle
of the verb ˇzeti (Engl. to reap).
(c) A string can represent verb forms as well as
forms of some other part of speech. Such
is the case with string viˇse that can represent
one of several comparative forms of the adjec-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96667721875">
tive visok (Engl. high), the adverb viˇse (Engl.
more), the preposition viˇse (Engl. above), and
the third person of the aorist of the verb viti
(Engl. to wind). Similarly, the string sirena
is the nominative singular of the noun sirena
(Engl. siren), but also the singular feminine
gender of the active past participle of the verb
siriti (Engl. to produce cheese).
The problem of disambiguation is particularly
difficult in the case of pronoun forms, such as mi
(the nominative of the pronoun we and the clitic of
the dative of the pronoun I) and je (the accusative
of the pronoun she/it), the conjunction da (Engl.
to, that, etc.), and the particles da (Engl. yes)
and li (Engl. if, whether) with certain forms of
the verbs miti (Engl. to wash), jesam (Engl. to
be), dati (Engl. to give), and liti (Engl. to pour).
This kind of ambiguity can partly be removed by
putting more frequent forms into a filter dictio-
nary that gives them precedence over less frequent
forms. For instance, the particle li is much more
frequent than the third person singular of the aorist
of the verb liti.

4 The structure of composite tenses in
Serbian
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653333333333">
In Serbian six composite tenses are used in the ac-
tive voice. The way they are constructed is de-
scribed by the graph in the Figure 1. The applica-
tion of this transducer to text R recognizes a total
of 401 occurrences of composite tenses. The con-
cordances of the recognized occurrences are given
in Figure 2.
However, the graph in Figure 1 does not
take account of variations of different kinds.
First, word order can vary so that the form
of the auxiliary verb follows the form of the
main verb. The recognized forms of the perfect
(PR) and conditional I (C1) shown in Figure
2 can be realized, in a different context as
video nisam, iˇsao je, , mogli biste. The rec-
ognized composite verb forms of the future I
tense (F1) ´cu primetiti and ´cu biti shown in the
same Figure have two alternative forms: (a)
the simple form primeti´cu and bi´cu, and (b) the
da-construction ja ´cu da primetim, ja ´cu da budem
that can be described with the regular expres-
sion (&lt;hteti:Pi&gt; + &lt;hteti:Ph&gt;) da
&lt;V:P&gt;. Moreover, the auxiliary verb is omitted
in the third person singular of the perfect tense
when the reflexive pronoun se occurs together
with the main verb. For instance, instead of the
string bojao:Gsm se:PRO je:PzsintextR
the string bojao:Gsm se:PRO is realized.
Second, the graph in Figure 1 does not express
the condition that the auxiliary verb and main verb
have to agree in gender and number. For instance,
the sequence dosxla:Gsf smo:Pxp can not
be a potential perfect tense because there is no
agreement in number (dosxla is a singular fem-
inine active past participle, while smo is the first
person plural of the verb jesam).

<bodyText confidence="0.998522956521739">
Third, a string of simple words of arbitrary
length can be inserted between the form of the
auxiliary verb and the form of the main verb. In
Table 3 the frequency of inserts of different length
that occurred in text P between the auxiliary verb
jesam and V:G (potentially representing
the perfect tense) is given.
The following occur among inserts comprising
one word: The reflexive pronoun se, the clitic
particle li, the clitic pronouns, adverbs, but also
the conjunction da that introduces a depen-
dent clause (for instance, Da su nxegovi
roditelxi znali da sam ja htela,).
Among inserts of two words occurs, for in-
stance Mislila sam da ste otisxli
that was already recognized among inserts of
length 0 as Mislila sam and ste otisxli.
This shows that the greedy algorithm is not
an adequate solution in recognizing composite
tenses. However, with a non-greedy algorithm
undesirable occurrences of composite tense
recognition also appear, as in the example To
je kao moja majka koja nije htela...

where the search algorithm looks for the first form
of the active past participle following the clitic
form of the auxiliary verb.
The structure of inserts can be modeled by a
subgraph that needs to be inserted at certain po-
sitions in graph shown in the Figure 1. This graph
named ins.fst, acts as a filter that tends to describe
the permitted inserts. This graph is built step by
step on the basis of the analysis of the concor-
dances that recognize the composite tenses. Fig-
ure 3 shows one of its subgraphs that recognizes
insertions consisting of pronominal clitics by tak-
ing into consideration their order.
The description of variations in the structure of
composite verbs from Figure 1 leads to the sub-
stitution of paths in this graph with subgraphs
that recognize particular composite tenses, tak-
ing into consideration the stated constraints. The
subgraph perfect.fst that recognizes the perfect
tense is given in Figure 4. The arcs in a sub-
graph can be represented by other subgraphs that
are implemented as finite transducers. The output
of each transducer is the morphological code of
the recognized form. The transducers inside the
graph are labeled as variables: $5 labels the sub-
graph jesam-ceo that encompasses all clitic and
negated forms of the verb jesam . This kind
of labeling enables a shift of the inserts into new
position, after the recognized form of the compos-
ite tense.
An example of successful recognition of the
perfect tense in text R with the transducer per-
fect.fst is given in Figure 5. The underlined parts
of text outside the parenthesis are fragments rec-
ognized by subgraph ins.fst.
Examples of unsuccessful recognition are given
in Figure 6. In the first example the number of
active past participle (p) and number of auxiliary
verb (s) do not agree. In the second example the
form of the clitic pronoun je has not been resolved
correctly, as subgraph ins.fst does not forbid oc-
currences of the auxiliary verb forms.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971117647059">
By tagging the text with information obtained
from the morphological e-dictionary and bycon-
struction of appropriate local grammars in the
form of finite transducers, it is possible to recog-
nize with considerable reliability the occurrences
of composite tenses in Serbian texts. In this way
the recognition of composite tenses remains in
the scope of morphological analysis and can be
achieved with the same technology that is used for
other morphological phenomena. The refinement
of obtained results is tightly coupled with the de-
gree of precision of the graph ins.fst that recog-
nizes inserts (Gross, 2000). On the other hand, it
is expected that a number of ambiguities described
in section 3 will be resolved through the develop-
ment of a dictionary of compounds DELAC and a
dictionary for disambiguation DESAMB.

In Serbian/Croatian this canonical form is the infinitive. This principle can be successfully applied, under certain constraints, to other inflective words as well, namely to the lemmatization of nouns and adjectives. However, the lemmatization of verb forms, viewed as the establishment of a relation between textual word and lexical word and the assignment of values of morphological categories that connect them, has many deficiencies (Gross, 1998- 1999), since composite verbs, though they represent conjugated forms of a verb, cannot be recognized within the same framework. For instance, the string video ga je (Engl. he saw him) will be tagged as an active past participle of the verb videti in singular masculine form, followed by a clitic pronoun ga, followed by the third person present of the auxiliary verb jesam. Comparing this string with the corresponding string in present tense vidi ga (Engl. he sees him) it can be clearly observed that the form video in the first example should be tagged as a third person perfect of the verb vide</context>

In this dictionary each verb (with a few exceptions) is represented by its infinitive form. For each verb, simple forms of conjugation, given as character strings between two consecutive separators, have been generated together with possible values of their morphological categories. This task has been accomplished by using descriptions of different verb classes in the form of regular expressions and their implementation by finite transducers incorporated in the INTEX system (Silberztein, 1993). A part of a regular expression in the INTEX format of the transducer V122.fst is: 2/:Ays:Azs + 2cxe/:Fzs:Fzp + 2la/:Gsf:Gpn + 2na/:Tfs:Tnp + &lt;E&gt;/:W + 2vsxi/:X + 4zxem/:Pxs + 4zxi/:Yys + So far, 339 transducers have been developed that precisely describe the simple verb forms of conjugation, starting from the verbs’ infinitive forms. For each verb, in addition to its verb forms, all the inflected forms of the corresponding verbal noun and passive past participle, if they exist, have been generated as well.
