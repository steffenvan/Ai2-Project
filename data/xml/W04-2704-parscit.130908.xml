The PropBank project is creating a corpus of
text annotated with information about basic
semantic propositions. PropBank I (Kingsbury
&amp; Palmer, 2002) added a layer of predicate-
argument information, or semantic roles, to
the syntactic structures of the English Penn
Treebank. This paper presents an overview
of the second phase of PropBank Annotation,
PropBank II, which is being applied to Eng-
lish and Chinese, and includes (Neodavid-
sonian) eventuality variables, nominal
references, sense tagging, and connections to
the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), a pro-
ject for annotating discourse connectives and
their arguments.

<bodyText confidence="0.999900545454546">
An important question is the degree to which current
statistical NLP systems can be made more domain-
independent without prohibitive costs, either in terms of
engineering or annotation. The Proposition Bank is
designed as a broad-coverage resource to facilitate the
development of more general systems. It focuses on the
argument structure of verbs, and provides a complete
corpus annotated with semantic roles, including partici-
pants traditionally viewed as arguments and ad-
juncts. Correctly identifying the semantic roles of the
sentence constituents is a crucial part of interpreting
text, and in addition to forming a component of the in-
formation extraction problem, can serve as an interme-
diate step in machine translation or automatic
summarization.
The Proposition Bank project takes a practical approach
to semantic representation, adding a layer of predicate-
argument information, or semantic roles, to the syntactic
structures of the Penn Treebank. The resulting resource
can be thought of as shallow, in that it does not repre-
sent co-reference, quantification, and many other
higher-order phenomena, but also broad, in that it cov-
ers every verb in the corpus and allows representative
statistics to be calculated. The semantic annotation pro-
vided by PropBank is only a first approximation at cap-
turing the full richness of semantic representation.
Additional annotation of nominalizations and other
noun predicates has already begun at NYU. This paper
presents an overview of the second phase of PropBank
Annotation, PropBank II, which is being applied to Eng-
lish and Chinese and includes (Neodavidsonian) eventu-
ality variables, nominal references, sense tagging, and
discourse connectives.

PropBank (Kingsbury &amp; Palmer, 2002) is an annotation
of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank
II (Marcus, 1994) with `predicate-argument&apos; structures,
using sense tags for highly polysemous words and se-
mantic role labels for each argument. An important goal
is to provide consistent semantic role labels across dif-
ferent syntactic realizations of the same verb, as in the
window in [ARG0 John] broke [ARG1 the window] and
[ARG1 The window] broke. PropBank can provide fre-
quency counts for (statistical) analysis or generation
components in a machine translation system, but pro-
vides only a shallow semantic analysis in that the anno-
tation is close to the syntactic structure and each verb is
its own predicate.
In PropBank, semantic roles are defined on a verb-by-
verb basis. An individual verb&apos;s semantic arguments are
simply numbered, beginning with 0. Polysemous verbs
1 Associated with Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Other members of the project are Eleni Miltsakaki, Rashmi Prasad,
(Univ. of PA) and Bonnie Webber (Univ. of Edinburgh)
have several Framesets, corresponding to a relatively
coarse notion of word senses, with a separate set of
numbered roles, a roleset, defined for each Frameset.
For instance, leave has both a DEPART Frameset ([ARG0
John] left [ARG1 the room]) and a GIVE Frameset, ([ARG0
I] left [ARG1 my pearls] [ARG2 to my daughter-in-law]
[ARGM-LOC in my will].) While most Framesets have
three or four numbered roles, as many as six can appear,
in particular for certain verbs of motion. Verbs can take
any of a set of general, adjunct-like arguments
(ARGMs), such as LOC (location), TMP (time), DIS
(discourse connectives), PRP (purpose) or DIR (direc-
tion). Negations (NEG) and modals (MOD) are also
marked.
The same annotation philosophy has been extended to
the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank (Xue and Palmer,
2003). The Chinese PropBank annotation is performed
on a smaller (250k words) and yet growing corpus an-
notated with syntactic structures (Xue et al 2004). The
same syntactic alternations that form the basis for the
English PropBank annotation also exist in robust quanti-
ties in Chinese, even though it may not be the case that
the same exact verbs (meaning verbs that are close
translations of one another) have the exact same range
of syntactic realization for Chinese and English. For
example, in (1), &amp;quot;xin-nian/New Year zhao-dai-
hui/reception&amp;quot; plays the same role in (a) and (b), which
is the event or activity held, even though it occurs in
different syntactic positions. Assigning the same argu-
ment label, Arg1, to both instances, captures this regu-
larity. It is worth noting that the predicate “ju-
xing/hold&amp;quot; does not have passive morphology in (1a),
despite of what its English translation suggests. Like the
English PropBank, the adjunct-like elements receive
more general labels like TMP or LOC, as also illustrated
in (1). The tag set for Chinese and English PropBanks
are to a large extent similar and more details can be
found in (Xue and Palmer, 2003).
(1) a. [ARG1 xin-nian/New Year zhao-dai-
hui/reception] [ARGM-TMP jin-tian/today] [ARGM-
LOC zai/at diao-yu-tai/Diaoyutai guo-bin-guan/state
guest house ju-xing/hold]
&amp;quot;The New Year reception was held in Diaoyutai State
Guest House today.&amp;quot;
b. [ARG0 tang-jia-xuan/Tang Jiaxuan] [ARGM-
TMP jin-tian/today] [ARGM-LOC zai/at diao-yu-
tai/Diaoyutai guo-bin-guan/state guest house] ju-
xing/hold [arg1 xin-nian/New Year zhao-dai-
hui/reception]
&amp;quot;Tang Jiaxuan was holding the New Year Reception in
Diaoyutai State Guest House today.&amp;quot;
For polysemous verbs that take different sets of seman-
tic roles, we also distinguish different Framesets. (2)
and (3) illustrate the different Framesets of &amp;quot;tong-
guo/pass&amp;quot;, which correspond loosely with major senses
of the verb. The Frameset in (2) roughly means &amp;quot;pass
by voting&amp;quot; while the Frameset illustrated by (3) means
&amp;quot;pass through&amp;quot;. The different Framesets are generally
reflected in the different alternation patterns, which can
serve as a cue for statistical systems performing Frame-
set disambiguation. (2) is similar to the causa-
tive/inchoative alternation (Levin, 1993). In contrast, (3)
shows object drop.

There are also some notable differences between Chi-
nese PropBank and English PropBank. In general, the
verbs in the Chinese PropBank are less polysemous,
with the vast majority of the verbs having just one
Frameset. On the other hand, the Chinese PropBank has
more verbs (including static verbs which are generally
translated into adjectives in English) normalized by the
corpus size.

3 Adding Event Variables to PropBank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.925342888888889">
Event variables provide a rich analytical tool for analyz-
ing verb meaning. Positing that there is an event vari-
able allows for a straightforward representation of the
logical form of adverbial modifiers, the capturing of
pronominal reference to events, and the representation
of nouns that refer to events. For example, event vari-
ables make it possible to have direct reference to an
event with a noun phrase, as in (4a) destruction, and to
refer back to an event with a pronoun (as illustrated in

century.
b. Brutus stabbed Caesar. That was a pivotal event

<bodyText confidence="0.9475022">
Arg2: their high-volume clients
As the representations in (7) illustrate, only the Neo-
davidsonian representation gives the correct interpreta-
tion of this sentence.
PropBank I annotations can be translated straightfor-
wardly into logical representations with event variables,
as illustrated in (5), with relations being defined as
predicates of events, and Args and ArgMs representing
relations between event variables and corresponding
phrases.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932817583333333">
(5) a. Mr. Bush met him privately, in the White House,
on Thursday.

&amp; MNR(e, privately) &amp; LOC(e, ‘in the White

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97651472">
As the representation in (5c) shows, we adopt Neo-
davidsonian analysis of events, which follows Parsons
(1990) in treating arguments on a par with modifiers in
the event structure. An alternative analysis is the origi-
nal Davidsonian analysis of events (Davidson 1967),
where the arguments of the verb are analyzed as its
logical arguments.
Our choice of a Neodavidsonian representation is moti-
vated by its predictions with respect to obligatoriness of
arguments. Under the Davidsonian approach, arguments
are logical arguments of the verb and thus must be im-
plied by the meaning of the sentence, either explicitly or
implicitly (i.e. existentially quantified). On the other
hand, it has been a crucial assumption in PropBank that
not all roles must necessarily be present in each sen-
tence. For example, the Frameset for the verb serve,
shown in (6a) has three roles: Arg0, Arg1, and Arg2.
Actual usages of the verb, on the other hand, do not
require the presence of all three roles. For example, the
sentence in (6b), as its PropBank annotation in (6c)
shows, does not include Arg1.
(6) a. serve.01 &amp;quot;act, work&amp;quot;:
Arg0:worker
Arg1:job, project
Arg2:employer
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.89146019047619">
b. Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten
by institutions seeking better ways *trace* to serve
their high-volume clients.
c. Arg0: *trace* -&gt; institutions
REL: serve
(7) Davidsonian representation:
∃e ∃z serve(e, institutions, z, their high-volume
clients)
Neodavidsonian representation:
∃e serve(e)&amp;Arg0(e, institutions)&amp;Arg2(e, their
high-volume clients)
Assuming a Neodavidsonian representation, we can
analyze all Args and certain types of modifiers as predi-
cates of events. The types of ArgMs that can be ana-
lyzed as predicates of event variables are shown below:
• MNR: to manage businesses profitably
• TMP: to run the company for 23 years
• LOC: to use the notes on the test
• DIR: to jump up
• CAU: because of ...
• PRP: in order to ...
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898">
Whereas for the most part, translating these adverbials
into modifiers of event variables does not require man-
ual annotation, certain constructions need human revi-
sion. For example, in the sentence in (8a) the temporal
ArgM ‘for the past five years’ does not modify the event
variable e introduced by the verb manage, as our auto-
matic translation would predict. The revised analysis of
this sentence, given in (8b), follows Krifka 1989, who
proposed that negated sentences refer to maximal events
– events that have everything that happened during their
running time as a part. Annotation of this sentence
would thus require us to introduce an additional event
variable, the maximal event e’, which has a duration
‘for the past five years’ and has no event of unions
managing wage increases as part.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.778340333333333">
(8) a. For the past five years, unions have not managed
to win wage increases.
b. ∃e’ TMP(e’, ‘for the past five years’) &amp;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976654571428571">
∃¬e(e&lt;e’ &amp; managing(e) &amp; Arg0(e, unions) &amp;
Arg1(e, ‘win wage increases’))
Further annotation involves linking empty categories in
PropBank to event variables in cases of control, as illus-
trated in (9), where event variables can be viewed as the
appropriate antecedents for PRO, marked as ‘*’ below:
(9) The car collided with a lorry, * killing both drivers.
And, finally, we will consider tagging variables accord-
ing to the aspectual class of the eventuality they denote,
such as states or events. Events, such as John built a
house, involve some kind of change and usually imply
that some condition, which obtains when the event be-
gins, is terminated by the event. States, on the other
hand, do not involve any change and hold for varying
amounts of time. It does not make sense to ask how long
a state took (as opposed to events), and whether the
state is culminated or finished.
This distinction between states and events plays an im-
portant role for the temporal analysis of discourse, as
the following examples (from Kamp and Reyle 1993)
illustrate:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953199">
(10) a. A man entered the White Hart. Bill served him a
beer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97233132">
b. I arrived at the Olivers’ cottage on Friday night.
It was not a propitious beginning to my visit. She
was ill and he in a foul mood.
If a non-initial sentence denotes an event, then it is typi-
cally understood as following the event described by the
preceding sentence. For example, in (10a), the event of
Bill serving a beer is understood as taking place after
the event of ‘a man entering the White Hart’ was com-
pleted. On the other hand, states are interpreted as tem-
porally overlapping with the time of the preceding
sentence, as illustrated in (10b). The sentences she was
ill and he was in a foul mood seem to describe a state of
affairs obtaining at the time of the speaker’s arrival.
As this example illustrates, there are different types of
temporal relations between eventualities (as we will call
both events and states) and adverbials that modify them,
such as temporal overlap and temporal containment.
Furthermore, these relations crucially depend on the
aspectual properties of the sentence. Translation of PB
annotations to logical representations with eventuality
variables and tagging these variables according to their
aspectual type would thus make it possible to provide an
analysis of temporal relations. This analysis should also
be compatible with a higher level of annotation of tem-
poral structure (e.g. Ferro et al, 2001).

4 Annotation of Nominal Coreference
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653823529412">
Our approach to coreference annotation is based on the
recognition of the different types of relationships that
might be called &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot;. The most straightfor-
ward case is that of two semantically definite NPs that
refer to identical entities, as in (11). Anaphoric rela-
tions (very broadly defined) are those in which one NP
(or possessive adjective) has no referential value of its
own but depends on an antecedent for its interpretation.
In some cases this can be relatively simple, as in (12), in
which the pronoun He takes John Smith as its antece-
dent. However, in some cases, as in (13), the antecedent
may not even be a referring expression, or can, as in
(14), refer to an entity that may or may not exist, with
the non-existent a car being the antecedent of it. The
anaphor does not have to be an NP, as in (15), in which
the possessive their, which takes many companies as its
antecedent, is an adjective.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996223375">
(11) John Smith of Company X arrived yesterday. Mr.
Smith said that...&amp;quot;
(12) John Smith of Company X arrived yesterday. He
said that...&amp;quot;
(13) No team spoke about its system.
(14) I want to buy a car. I need it to go to work.
(15) Many companies raised their payouts by more than
10%.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997302428571429">
Another level of complexity is raised by NPs that are
not anaphors, in that they have their own reference (per-
haps abstract or nonexistent), but are not in an identity
relationship with an antecedent, but rather describe a
property of that antecedent. Typical cases of this are
predicate nominals, as in (16), or appositives, as in (17),
and other cases as in (18).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9818245">
(16) Larry is a university lecturer.
(17) Larry, the chair of his department, became presi-
dent.
(18) The stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998653818181818">
As has been discussed (e.g., van Deemter &amp; Kibble,
2001), such cases have fundamentally different proper-
ties than either the identity relationships of (11) or the
anaphoric relationships of (12)-(15).
Annotation of nominal co-reference is being done in
two passes. The first pass involves annotation of true
co-reference between semantically definite NPs`. The
issue here is to consider what the semantically definite
nouns are. Initially, they are defined as proper nouns
(named entities), either as NPs (America) or prenominal
adjectives (American politicians).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94637175">
(19) The last time the S&amp;P 500 yield dropped below 3%
was in the summer of 1987... There have been only
seven other times when the yield on the S&amp;P 500
dropped....
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950670787234043">
It is reasonable to expand this to definite descriptions,
so that in (19), the S&amp;P 500 yield and the yield on the
S&amp;P 500 are marked as coreferring. However, some
definite NPs can refer to clauses, not NPs, such as The
pattern in (20), and we will not do such cases of clausal
antecedents on the first pass.
(20) The index fell 40% in 1975 and jumped 80% in
1976. The pattern is an unusual one.
Anaphoric relations are being done on a &amp;quot;need-to-
annotate&amp;quot; basis. For each anaphoric NP or possessive
adjective, the annotator needs to determine its antece-
dent. As discussed, this is a different type of relation
than identity, and this distinction will be noted in the
annotation. The issue here is what we consider an ana-
phoric element to be. We consider all cases of pro-
nouns, possessives, reflexives, and NPs with that/those
to be potential cases of anaphors (again, broadly de-
fined). However, as with definite NPs, we only mark
those that have an NP antecedent, and not clausal ante-
cedents. For example, in (21), it refers to the current
3.3% reading, and so would be marked as being in an
antecedent-anaphor relation. In (22), it refers to having
the dividend increases, which is not an NP, and so
would not be marked as being in an anaphor relation in
the first pass. Similar considerations apply to potential
anaphors like those NP, that NP, etc.
(21) ...the current 3.3% reading isn&apos;t as troublesome as
it might have been.
(22) Having the dividend increases is a supportive ele-
ment in the market outlook, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a
main consideration&amp;quot;.
Note that placing the burden on the anaphors to deter-
mine what gets marked as being in an anaphor-
antecedent leaves it open as to what the antecedent
might be, other than the requirement just mentioned of it
being an NP. Not only might it be non-referring NPs as
in (13) or (14), it could even be a generic, as in (23), in
which books is the antecedent for they.
(23) I like books. They make me smile.
The second pass will tackle the more difficult issues:
1. Descriptive NPs, as in (16)-(18). While the informa-
tion provided by these cases would be extremely valu-
able for information extraction and other systems, there
are some uncertain issues here, mostly focusing on how
such descriptors describe the antecedent at different
moments in time and/or space. The crucial question is
therefore what to take the descriptor to be.

(24) Henry Higgins might become the president of
Dreamy Detergents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990893214285714">
For example, in (18), it can&apos;t be just $4.02 and $3.85,
since this does not include information about *when*
the stock price had such values. The same issue arises
for (17). As van Deemter &amp; Kibble point out, such
cases can interact with issues of modality in uncertain
ways, as illustrated in (24). Just saying that in (24) the
president of Dreamy Detergents is in the same type of
relationship with Henry Higgins as a university lecturer
is with Larry in (16) would be very misleading.
2. Clausal antecedents - Here we will handle cases of it
and other anaphor elements and definite NPs referring
to non-NPs as antecedents, as in (21). This will most
likely be done by referring to the eventuality variable
associated with the antecedent.

5 Linking to the Penn Discourse Treebank
(PDTB)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9902375">
The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is currently be-
ing built by the PDTB team at the University of Penn-
sylvania, providing the next appropriate level of
annotation: the annotation of the predicate argument
structure of connectives (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b). The
PDTB project is based on the idea that discourse con-
nectives can be thought of as predicates with their asso-
ciated argument structure. This perspective of discourse
is based on a series of papers extending lexicalized tree-
adjoining grammar (LTAG) to discourse (DLTAG),
beginning with Webber and Joshi (1998).2 This level of
annotation is quite complex for a variety of reasons,
such as the lack of available literature describing dis-
course connectives and frequent occurrences of empty
(lexically null) connectives between two sentences that
cannot be ignored. Also, unlike the predicates at the
sentence level, some of the discourse connectives, espe-
cially discourse adverbials, take their arguments ana-
phorically and not structurally, requiring an intimate
association with event variable representation.
The long-range goal of the PDTB project is to develop a
large scale and reliably annotated corpus that will en-
code coherence relations associated with discourse con-
nectives, including their argument structure and
anaphoric links, thus exposing a clearly defined level of
discourse structure and supporting the extraction of a
range of inferences associated with discourse connec-
tives. This annotation will reference the Penn Treebank
(PTB) annotations as well as PropBank.
In PDTB, a variety of connectives are considered, such
as subordinate and coordinate conjunctions, adverbial
connectives and implicit connectives amounting to a
total of approximately 20,000 annotations; 10,000 im-

ent of DLTAG framework for two reasons: (1) to make the

different frameworks and (2) to make the annotation task

plicit connectives and 10,000 annotations of the 250
explicit connectives identified in the corpus (for details
see (Miltsakaki et al 2004a and Miltsakaki et al 2004b).
Current annotations in PDTB are performed by four
annotators. Individual annotation proceeds one connec-
tive at a time. This way, the annotators quickly gain
experience with that connective and develop a better
understanding of its predicate-argument characteristics.
For the annotation of implicit connectives, the annota-
tors are required to provide an explicit connective that
best expressed the inferred relation.
The PDTB is expected to be released by November
2005. The final version of the corpus will also contain
characterizations of the semantic roles associated with
the arguments of each type of connective as well as
links to PropBank.

6. Annotation of Word Senses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999480882353">
The critical question with respect to sense tagging in-
volves the choice of senses. In other words, which
sense inventory, and which level of granularity with
respect to that sense inventory? The PropBank Frames
Files for the verbs include coarse-grained sense distinc-
tions based primarily on usages of a verb that have dif-
ferent numbers of predicate-arguments. These are
termed Framesets – referring to the set of roles for each
one and the corresponding set of syntactic frames. We
are currently sense-tagging the annotated predicates for
lemmas with multiple Framesets, which can be done
quickly and accurately with an inter-annotator agree-
ment of over 90%. The distinctions made by the
Framesets are very coarse, and each one would map to
several standard dictionary entries for the lemma in
question. More fine-grained sense distinctions could be
useful for Automatic Content Extraction, yet it remains
to be determined exactly which distinctions are neces-
sary and what methodology should be followed to pro-
vide additional word sense annotation.
Palmer et al (2004b) present an hierarchical approach to
verb senses, where different levels of sense distinctions,
from PropBank Framesets to WordNet senses, form a
continuum of granularity. At the intermediate level of
sense hierarchy we are considering manual groupings of
the SENSEVAL-2 verb senses (Palmer, et.al., 2004a),
developed in a separate project. Given a large disagree-
ment rate between annotators (average inter-annotator
agreement rate for Senseval-2 verbs was only 71%),
verbs were grouped by two or more people into sets of
closely related senses, with grouping differences being
reconciled, and the sense groups were used for coarse-
grained scoring of the systems. These groupings of
WordNet senses were shown to reconcile a substantial
portion of the manual and automatic tagging disagree-
ments, showing that many of these disagreements are
fairly subtle. Using the groups as a more coarse-grained
set of sense distinctions improved ITA and system
scores by almost 10%, to 82% and 69%, respectively
(Palmer, et. al. 2004a).
We have been investigating whether or not the groups
can provide an intermediate level of hierarchy in be-
tween the PropBank Framesets and the WN 1.7 senses.
Based on our existing WN 1.7 tags and Frameset tags of
the Senseval2 verbs in the Penn Treebank, 95% of the
verb instances map directly from sense groups to
Framesets, with each Frameset typically corresponding
to two or more sense groups. Using the PropBank
coarse-grained senses as a starting place, and WordNet
sense tagging for over 1000 verbs produced automati-
cally through mapping VerbNet to PropBank (Kipper,
et. al., 2004), we have the makings of a large scale tag-
ging experiment on the Penn Treebank. This will en-
able investigations into the applicability of clearly
defined criteria for sense distinctions at varying levels
of granularity, and produce a large, 1M word corpus of
sense-tagged text for training WSD systems
The hierarchical approach to verb senses, as utilized by
most standard dictionaries as well as Hector (Atkins,
’93), and as applied to SENSEVAL-2, presents obvious
advantages for the problem of Word Sense Disambigua-
tion. The human annotation task is simplified, since
there are fewer choices at each level and clearer distinc-
tions between them. The automated systems can com-
bine training data from closely related senses to
overcome the sparse data problem, and both humans
and systems can back off to a more coarse-grained
choice when fine-grained choices prove too difficult.

This paper has presented an overview of the second
phase of PropBank Annotation, PropBank II, which is
being applied to English and Chinese. It includes (Neo-
davidsonian) eventuality variables, nominal references,
an hierarchical approach to sense tagging, and connec-

An alternative analysis is the original Davidsonian analysis of events (Davidson 1967), where the arguments of the verb are analyzed as its logical arguments. Our choice of a Neodavidsonian representation is motivated by its predictions with respect to obligatoriness of arguments. Under the Davidsonian approach, arguments are logical arguments of the verb and thus must be implied by the meaning of the sentence, either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. existentially quantified). On the other hand, it has been a crucial assumption in PropBank that not all roles must necessarily be present in each sentence.

Furthermore, these relations crucially depend on the aspectual properties of the sentence. Translation of PB annotations to logical representations with eventuality variables and tagging these variables according to their aspectual type would thus make it possible to provide an analysis of temporal relations. This analysis should also be compatible with a higher level of annotation of temporal structure (e.g. Ferro et al, 2001). 4 Annotation of Nominal Coreference Our approach to coreference annotation is based on the recognition of the different types of relationships that might be called &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot;. The most straightforward case is that of two semantically definite NPs that refer to identical entities, as in (11). Anaphoric relations (very broadly defined) are those in which one NP (or possessive adjective) has no referential value of its own but depends on an antecedent for its interpretation. In some cases this can be relatively simple, as in (12), in which the pronoun He takes John Smith as its antecedent. H</context>

Events, such as John built a house, involve some kind of change and usually imply that some condition, which obtains when the event begins, is terminated by the event. States, on the other hand, do not involve any change and hold for varying amounts of time. It does not make sense to ask how long a state took (as opposed to events), and whether the state is culminated or finished. This distinction between states and events plays an important role for the temporal analysis of discourse, as the following examples (from Kamp and Reyle 1993) illustrate: (10) a. A man entered the White Hart. Bill served him a beer. b. I arrived at the Olivers’ cottage on Friday night. It was not a propitious beginning to my visit. She was ill and he in a foul mood. If a non-initial sentence denotes an event, then it is typically understood as following the event described by the preceding sentence. For example, in (10a), the event of Bill serving a beer is understood as taking place after the event of ‘a man entering the White Hart’ was completed. On the other hand, states are interpreted as temporally overlapping with the time of the preceding se</context>

The PDTB project is based on the idea that discourse connectives can be thought of as predicates with their associated argument structure. This perspective of discourse is based on a series of papers extending lexicalized treeadjoining grammar (LTAG) to discourse (DLTAG), beginning with Webber and Joshi (1998).2 This level of annotation is quite complex for a variety of reasons, such as the lack of available literature describing discourse connectives and frequent occurrences of empty (lexically null) connectives between two sentences that cannot be ignored.

Current annotations in PDTB are performed by four annotators. Individual annotation proceeds one connective at a time. This way, the annotators quickly gain experience with that connective and develop a better understanding of its predicate-argument characteristics. For the annotation of implicit connectives, the annotators are required to provide an explicit connective that best expressed the inferred relation. The PDTB is expected to be released by November 2005. The final version of the corpus will also contain characterizations of the semantic roles associate</context>

We are currently sense-tagging the annotated predicates for lemmas with multiple Framesets, which can be done quickly and accurately with an inter-annotator agreement of over 90%. The distinctions made by the Framesets are very coarse, and each one would map to several standard dictionary entries for the lemma in question. More fine-grained sense distinctions could be useful for Automatic Content Extraction, yet it remains to be determined exactly which distinctions are necessary and what methodology should be followed to provide additional word sense annotation. Palmer et al (2004b) present an hierarchical approach to verb senses, where different levels of sense distinctions, from PropBank Framesets to WordNet senses, form a continuum of granularity. At the intermediate level of sense hierarchy we are considering manual groupings of the SENSEVAL-2 verb senses (Palmer, et.al., 2004a), developed in a separate project. Given a large disagreement rate between annotators (average inter-annotator agreement rate for Senseval-2 verbs was only 71%), verbs were grouped by two or more people into sets of closely related senses, with grouping differences being reconciled, and the </context>

We are currently sense-tagging the annotated predicates for lemmas with multiple Framesets, which can be done quickly and accurately with an inter-annotator agreement of over 90%. The distinctions made by the Framesets are very coarse, and each one would map to several standard dictionary entries for the lemma in question. More fine-grained sense distinctions could be useful for Automatic Content Extraction, yet it remains to be determined exactly which distinctions are necessary and what methodology should be followed to provide additional word sense annotation. Palmer et al (2004b) present an hierarchical approach to verb senses, where different levels of sense distinctions, from PropBank Framesets to WordNet senses, form a continuum of granularity. At the intermediate level of sense hierarchy we are considering manual groupings of the SENSEVAL-2 verb senses (Palmer, et.al., 2004a), developed in a separate project. Given a large disagreement rate between annotators (average inter-annotator agreement rate for Senseval-2 verbs was only 71%), verbs were grouped by two or more people into sets of closely related senses, with grouping differences being reconciled, and the </context>

An alternative analysis is the original Davidsonian analysis of events (Davidson 1967), where the arguments of the verb are analyzed as its logical arguments. Our choice of a Neodavidsonian representation is motivated by its predictions with respect to obligatoriness of arguments. Under the Davidsonian approach, arguments are logical arguments of the verb and thus must be implied by the meaning of the sentence, either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. existentially quantified). On the other hand, it has been a crucial assumpti</context>

The PDTB project is based on the idea that discourse connectives can be thought of as predicates with their associated argument structure. This perspective of discourse is based on a series of papers extending lexicalized treeadjoining grammar (LTAG) to discourse (DLTAG), beginning with Webber and Joshi (1998).2 This level of annotation is quite complex for a variety of reasons, such as the lack of available literature describing discourse connectives and frequent occurrences of empty (lexically null) connectives between two sentences that cannot be ignored. Also, unlike the predicates at the sentence level, some of the discourse connectives, especially discourse adverbials, take their arguments anaphorically and not structurally, requiring an intimate association with event variable representation. The long-range goal of the PDTB project is to develop a large scale and reliably annotated corpus th</context>

While most Framesets have three or four numbered roles, as many as six can appear, in particular for certain verbs of motion. Verbs can take any of a set of general, adjunct-like arguments (ARGMs), such as LOC (location), TMP (time), DIS (discourse connectives), PRP (purpose) or DIR (direction). Negations (NEG) and modals (MOD) are also marked. The same annotation philosophy has been extended to the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2003). The Chinese PropBank annotation is performed on a smaller (250k words) and yet growing corpus annotated with syntactic structures (Xue et al 2004). The same syntactic alternations that form the basis for the English PropBank annotation also exist in robust quantities in Chinese, even though it may not be the case that the same exact verbs (meaning verbs that are close translations of one another) have the exact same range of syntactic realization for Chinese and English. For example, in (1), &amp;quot;xin-nian/New Year zhao-daihui/reception&amp;quot; plays the same role in (a) and (b), which is the event or a</context>
