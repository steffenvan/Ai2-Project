<bodyText confidence="0.9986475">
The development of Human Language Technology
(HLT) is one of the important by-products of the in-
formation revolution. However, the level of knowl-
edge and skills in HLT for African languages remain
unfortunately low as most scholars continue to work
within the frameworks of knowledge production for
an industrial society while the information age dawns.
This paper reports the work of African Languages
Technology Initiative (Alt-i) over a five-year period,
and thereby presents a proposal for the acceleration of
the development of knowledge and skills in HLT for
African languages.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994041509434">
The world is undergoing a transformation from
industrial economies to an information economy,
in which the indices of value are shifting from
material to non-material resources. This trans-
formation has been rightly described as a revolu-
tion because of the height of its pace and inten-
sity. Of necessity therefore, the response to the
changes brought about by the information revo-
lution has to be commensurate, both in pace and
intensity.
At the root of the information revolution is
the development of digital technology which has
brought about a major shift in the way we con-
ceptualize, describe and anticipate our world.
One of the salient social imperatives of the in-
formation revolution is the need for humans to
communicate through and with machines. This
has brought about the need to make machines
capable of handling natural language used by
humans as against formal language used by ma-
chines. The field of Human Language Technol-
ogy (HLT) was developed to provide the neces-
sary knowledge and skills that will enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency with which ma-
chines mediate communication between humans
as well as facilitate communication between hu-
mans and machines.
So far, developments in HLT have not suffi-
ciently addressed African languages. This is at-
tributable to a low level of awareness of the im-
portance of and lack of interest in HLT and
among scholars of African languages and schol-
ars of technology on the African continent. Fur-
thermore, there is little or no immediate eco-
nomic incentive in working in HLT. Conse-
quently, there is a dearth of scholars with the
requisite impetus, knowledge and skills to sup-
port the development of HLT for African lan-
guages. Hence, even though there are pockets of
activities in Africa, the level of development of
HLT for African languages remains low.
The circumstances that necessitated the de-
velopment of HLT have been described, and
rightly so as a revolution. The response therefore
has to be commensurate both in pace and inten-
sity. Hence, the need for accelerated develop-
ment of HLT for African languages is urgent.
This paper presents a proposal aimed at accel-
erating the development of HLT for African lan-
guages based on the experiences gathered at Af-
rican Languages Technology Initiative (Alt-i)
over a five-year period of activities mainly in
Nigeria.

2 The State of Language technology in
Africa
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944">
The application of Language technology to Afri-
can languages is relatively new and most efforts
seem to be incidental. The most consistent ef-
forts motivated and guided by national policy
come from South Africa while projects in other
countries are based primarily on private initia-
tives. In a report on HLT development in Sub-
Saharan Africa, Justus Roux (2008) reported nine
organizations involved in HLT activities in South
Africa, one organization in West Africa and two
in East Africa. Seven out of the nine organiza-
tions in South Africa are based in universities,
one is a Semi-Government institution and one is
an agency of the Government.
The seven universities with HLT projects are:

Apart from the organisations reported above,
there are individual efforts in some universities.
These include Dr. Odetunji Odejobi working on
Text to Speech Synthesis at Obafemi Awolowo
University, Ile Ife, Nigeria, Dr. Wanjiku
Ng&apos;ang&apos;a working on Machine Translation and
Dr. Peter Wagacha working on Machine Learn-
ing, both at the at the University of Nairobi,
Kenya.
Apart from these organizations and individu-
als that are strictly located in Africa, there are a
number other efforts in various parts of the
world that address HLT for Africa languages,
usually in cooperation with some organizations
in Africa. Examples include:

• Local Language Speech Technology Ini-

<bodyText confidence="0.847162416666667">
Also, there are significant short-term activi-
ties on language technology for African lan-

have not been sufficiently publicized. For exam-
ple, in 2002, there was an undergraduate project
in Yoruba-English machine translation at the St
Mary&apos;s College of Maryland, USA.1

Bisharat and SIL. Even though both organizations are
not strictly founded for developing language technol-

3 On-going Alt-i Activities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962175">
Since its inception, Alt-i has done more work in
Yoruba than in other African languages. This is
due primarily to the ready availability of intellec-
tual and other resources for Yoruba at Alt-i&apos;s base
in Ibadan. However, work in a few other lan-
guages with available local resources have also
been undertaken. The main projects undertaken
so far are:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9941055">
3.1 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of
Yoruba
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987075">
The ASR project started in 2001, and is still on-
going. A PhD thesis with the title of Application
of Tonemic Information for Search-Space Reduc-
tion in the Automatic Speech Recognition of Yo-
ruba is one of the results of the ASR project. The
project approaches ASR of Yoruba from the
point of view that Yoruba tones carry so much
information that “talking drums” can “speak” the
Yoruba language, hence, ASR of Yoruba (and
probably other African tone languages) should be
based primarily on tones or at least should ad-
dress considerable computational resources to-
wards correct identification of tones. Experi-
ments have shown that a tone-guided search of
the recognition space as proposed in the above
PhD thesis leads to improvement in recognition
speed and accuracy. ASR efforts are continuing
within the project “Redefining Literacy”; Alt-i&apos;s
main on-going project funded by the Open Soci-
ety Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA).

<bodyText confidence="0.999988272727273">
This project was conceived and initiated in 2002.
TTS is a major component of the “Redefining
Literacy” project but we have not yet succeeded
in attracting funding for this component of the
project. Hence, it is in abeyance. However, one
of our Associates, Dr. Odetunji Odejobi of the
Department of Computer Science and Engineer-
ing of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife
is actively working on TTS and we are collabora-
tion with him on this project. Dr. Odejobi ap-
plies fuzzy logic to formalise Yoruba prosody.

tics and African Languages as well as the Africa
Regional Center for information Science, both at
the University of Ibadan. The main thrust of the
present stage of the project is identifying and
developing formal specifications for various
challenges of a rule-based machine translation as
it relates to translation between Igbo/Yoruba and
English.

3.4 Yoruba Spelling checker
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952954545455">
As a member of the African Network of Localiz-
ers (AnLoc), Alt-i is developing a spelling
checker for Yoruba in Open Office. This has
provided the opportunity to undertake a compu-
tational study of Yoruba morphology. Staff and
students of the Department of Linguistics and
African Languages at the University of Ibadan
are playing an active role in this project. The
work is producing new insights for interpreting
the existing literature of Yoruba morphology and
is already leading to interests in similar projects
for other languages. As at the time of writing, a
dictionary file of about 5000 Yoruba root words
and over 100 highly productive affix rules have
been developed. Even though some important
Yoruba morphological rules cannot be efficiently
coded in Hunspell (the software on which the
spelling checker is based) the modest dictionary
and affix files have produced a useful spelling
checker. The project is funded by the Interna-
tional Development Research Center (IDRC) of
Canada.

As a by-product of the Yoruba spelling checker
project, Alt-i is developing an automatic diacritic
application program, using the Bayesian learning
approach. This project is not funded, but it is
taking due advantage of some of the resources,
particularly the corpus produced in the IDRC
funded spelling checker project. Work is on-
going to expand the corpus used for the auto-

Alt-i was appointed by Microsoft as moderators
for the localization of Microsoft Vista and Office
Suite into Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. This project
is making steady progress.
3.7 Academic assistance to the University of
Ibadan
Apart from the above projects, Alt-i offers aca-
demic support to the University of Ibadan. The
Executive Director of Alt-i teaches post-graduate
courses in Artificial Intelligence and Information
Networking as well as supervises post-graduate
projects at the Africa Regional Center for Infor-
mation Science (ARCIS) in the University of
Ibadan. He also gives various levels of support
in the supervision of post-graduate projects, par-
ticularly in the area of acoustic analysis of speech
at the Department of Linguistics and African
Languages.
Some of the HLT issues addressed in the
Master in Information Science projects between
2002 and the present include:
Statistical Language Model (SLM) of Yoruba,
Man-Machine Communication in Yoruba, Ma-
chine Translation between spoken and signed
Yoruba for the deaf and impaired in hearing, Yo-
ruba phonology multimodal learning courseware
and phonetically motivated automatic language
identification.
Many PhD students of the Department of Lin-
guistics and African Languages have also en-
joyed intellectual support and use of Alt-i&apos;s
speech laboratory in their studies

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887652173913">
Many staff members and students from far and
wide travel to Ibadan to use Alt-i&apos;s speech labora-
tory. PhD students as well as faculty members
from the University of Lagos, University of Ilo-
rin, University of Benin and University of Abuja
come regularly to use the facilities. At present a
teaching staff of the Department of Systems En-
gineering of the University of Lagos is undertak-
ing a PhD programme on ASR of Yoruba. This
PhD candidate visits Ibadan frequently and regu-
larly to use Alt-i&apos;s library and speech laboratory,
as well as consult Alt-i staff.
Alt-i is involved in the activities of various
scholarly associations such as the West African
Linguistic Society (WALS), Linguistics Asso-
ciation of Nigeria (LAN) and the Yoruba Studies
Association of Nigeria (YSAN). In 2004, Alt-i
collaborated with the West African Linguistics
Society to organize the West African Languages
Congress with the theme: Globalisation and the
Future of African Languages. Alt-i&apos;s collabora-

Alt-i runs a Bridge Building Seminar series as a
way of encouraging cross-disciplinary studies in
universities and research centers. These semi-
nars have so far been run in eight Nigerian uni-
versities and the National Institute for Nigerian

While undertaking the above activities in the last
five years between 2003 and 2008, the following
observation were made:

<listItem confidence="0.909536826086956">
• The intellectual resources needed for de-
veloping knowledge, skills and academic
programmes in Language Technology
are largely available in Nigerian univer-
sities.
• The lack of awareness of the need to ad-
dress language technology problems has
made it difficult to harness and direct
these resources towards the development
of language technology for African lan-
guages.
• Strong sentimental attachments to de-
partmental traditions makes it extremely
difficult for scholars to venture far out-
side their departmental cocoons.
• The importance of linguistics as a field
of study and the role of linguists in soci-
ety are not properly understood. Hence
students of linguistic may not be suffi-
ciently motivated to aspire to their im-
portant roles in society.
• Inappropriate admission criteria, limited

5 Recommendations
</sectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.848166727272727">
• Intensive and sustained awareness build-
ing programmes on the importance of
linguistics and language technology
should be undertaken in institutions of
higher learning. This will make it possi-
ble to harness some of the available intel-
lectual resources that remain yet un-
tapped for the development of language
technology for African languages in
these institutions.
• Admission criteria and curricular should
be reviewed in order to encourage and
capacitate students to widen their intel-
lectual horizon beyond the artificial tra-
ditional departmental boundaries.
• Modern techniques for the management
of learning resources should be em-
ployed in order to address the logistic
challenges that discourage students from
taking courses across the faculties of sci-
ence, technology and arts.
6 Alt-i: a historical perspective
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953833333333">
Initial interests in language technology that ulti-
mately led to the founding of Alt-i date back to
1978, but it was in 1985 that a small group of one
Electrical Engineer and two Physicist started to
investigate Text to Speech synthesis of Yoruba in
Ibadan, Nigeria. All they were armed with was a
book (Electronic Speech Synthesis by Geof Bris-
tow), a microphone and storage oscilloscope. It
was extremely difficult to get the required mate-
rials in the Nigeria of those days.
Unfortunately, neither the Physicists nor the
Engineer realized the relevance of linguistics in
their work because the academic environment
within which they grew did not provide the nec-
essary impetus for interdisciplinary or multidis-
ciplinary studies between certain fields of study,
certainly not between linguistics, physics and
engineering. This brought about a lot of misdi-
rected efforts and frustration. By 2001 however,
with better access to the scientific literature of
computational linguistics and HLT, it had be-
come clear to what was left of the group that
HLT is as much an issue in language as it is an
issue in technology.
A careful review of the relevant aspects of the
scientific literature of linguistics was then under-
taken. Contacts were made with some of the
known scholars of Yoruba phonology and their
insights brought new impetus to the work, lead-
ing to the founding of Alt-i in 2001.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992451">
56
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984117647059">
The salient point in this historical perspective
is that the academic environment that produced
the members of the original group did not pro-
vide the necessary impetus for the level of cross-
disciplinary cooperation demanded by the solu-
tions to the problems the group was addressing.
Even though there were many papers that illus-
trated fruitful connections between linguistics
and computer science in the mid 1980&apos;s, the Ni-
gerian economy was in such a bad state that the
universities could not afford to keep their librar-
ies updated with current publications in any field.
Nigerian universities now have noticeably better
access to the global academic literature but a sys-
temic weaknesses that does not encourage inter-
disciplinary scholarship still subsists and needs
to be addressed.

7 Proposal
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990773809524">
A project with advocacy and service components
aimed at accelerating the development of lan-
guage technology for African languages is here-
by proposed. The aim of the proposed project is
to produce lecturers, researchers and other ex-
perts in language technology for African lan-
guages.
The advocacy component will identify and
develop policy thrusts that will encourage the
development of language technology and raise
awareness at various levels of the importance of
linguistics and language technology. These in-
clude raising awareness among secondary school
students, university undergraduates, cultural ac-
tivists and relevant policy makers.
Within the service component, in affiliation
with a university, a post-graduate course of study
aimed at producing a number of PhDs in lan-
guage technology/computational linguistics with-
in the space of about five to six years is to be
developed. The candidates for this post-graduate
course shall be university graduates of various
relevant fields. The programme shall start with a
one year diploma programme of intensive course
work in linguistics, computational and cognitive
sciences. These will serve to widen the knowl-
edge-base of the participants thereby creating the
necessary connections between their back-
grounds and various aspects of language tech-
nology. Those that attain a high level of
achievement in the diploma course may stay on
for another six-months to undertake a practical
project in language technology. Success in this
project will earn such candidates a master degree
in language technology or computational linguis-
tics. Graduates of the master programme that
attain a high level of performance in the project
will be encouraged to stay on for the PhD pro-
gramme.
The main faculty for the programme shall be
drawn from relevant departments in the univer-
sity. They shall undergo induction courses (lo-
cally and overseas) to re-orientate their knowl-
edge towards applications in language technol-
ogy.
To kick-start the programme, the support of
scholars in the international language technology
community shall be sought for curricular devel-
opment as well as teaching. Occasional or short-
term visiting lectureships will be accommodated
within sabbatical, fellowship and exchange pro-
grammes.
As an on-going experiment in this regard, two
students of the university of Ibadan are at present
working together on Yoruba-English machine
translation. One student is a graduate of Com-
puter Science, working towards a master degree
in Information Science, while the other is a grad-
uate of Linguistics working towards a master de-
gree in Linguistics. The two students are jointly
supervised by a lecturer in Information Science
and a lecturer in Linguistics. Even though the
computer science graduate has never had any
formal training in Linguistics and the Linguistics
graduate has never had any formal training in
computing, their collaboration has served to wi-
den their knowledge-bases. The student of lin-
guistics is approaching the project from the point
of view of comparative syntax and is now able to
express syntax rules in the form of context-free-
grammar in Prolog, while the Information Sci-
ence student is approaching the project from the
point of view of predicate logic as a knowledge
representation formalism and now has a fair un-
derstanding of the principles of Yoruba and Eng-
lish grammars.
Even though the experiment is still on-going,
the emerging results suggest that the one year of
formal study in the proposed diploma programme
will provide adequate knowledge and skills for
graduates of the physical sciences, computer sci-
ence, technology, linguistics and psychology to
undertake productive research in language tech-
nology.

8 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999919333333333">
The development of language technology for Af-
rican languages is at a rather embryonic stage.
Apart from the efforts in South Africa, there are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994672">
57
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966289473684">
little or no coherent programmes on language
technology in African universities. National lan-
guage policies where they exist do not accom-
modate language technology issues and there is
a generally low level of awareness of the benefits
derivable from language technology.
With one-third of the world&apos;s languages spo-
ken in Africa, there is an urgent need for the de-
velopment of new techniques that address the
peculiar features of these languages and thereby
make it possible for the cultures that use them to
benefit from the information revolution without
having to adopt foreign languages
The implementation of the proposed aca-
demic programme in HLT would require active
support of the Nigerian government in coopera-
tion and collaboration with other friendly gov-
ernments as well as various multilateral agencies
for funding and other resources. However, in the
absence of a language policy and a coherent lan-
guage technology programme, the advocacy
component becomes be the necessary starting
point.
Developments in HLT and computational lin-
guistics present avenues for Nigerian universities
to re-invigorate the study of linguistics, provide
new impetus for students of linguistics and pre-
pare graduates of linguistics for more roles in
society than the traditional teaching of local lan-
guages at secondary level. Nigerian universities
must therefore play an important role in the nec-
essary advocacy.
As the world moves further into the informa-
tion age, concerted efforts are need to ensure that
developments in HLT takes due account of Afri-
can languages so that African languages and cul-
tures can benefit from the information revolu-
tion.

<context position="3507" citStr="Roux (2008)" startWordPosition="562" endWordPosition="563">imed at accelerating the development of HLT for African languages based on the experiences gathered at African Languages Technology Initiative (Alt-i) over a five-year period of activities mainly in Nigeria. 2 The State of Language technology in Africa The application of Language technology to African languages is relatively new and most efforts seem to be incidental. The most consistent efforts motivated and guided by national policy come from South Africa while projects in other countries are based primarily on private initiatives. In a report on HLT development in SubSaharan Africa, Justus Roux (2008) reported nine organizations involved in HLT activities in South Africa, one organization in West Africa and two in East Africa. Seven out of the nine organizations in South Africa are based in universities, one is a Semi-Government institution and one is an agency of the Government. The seven universities with HLT projects are: Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Language Technologies for African Languages – AfLaT 2009, pages 53–58, Athens, Greece, 31 March 2009. c�2009 Association for Computational Linguistics 53 • University of Cape Town • University of Limpopo • University of the Nort</context>
