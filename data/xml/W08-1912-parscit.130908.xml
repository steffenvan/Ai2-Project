We compare a psycholinguistic approach
of mental lexicon organization with a com-
putational approach of implicit lexical or-
ganization as found in dictionaries. In this
work, we associate dictionaries with ’small
world’ graphs. This multidisciplinary ap-
proach aims at showing that implicit struc-
ture of dictionaries, mathematically iden-
tified, fits the way young children catego-
rize. These dictionary graphs might there-
fore be considered as ’cognitive artifacts’.
This shows the importance of semantic
proximity both in cognitive and computa-
tional organization of verbs lexicon.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999808764705882">
According to (Dik, 1991) a linguistic theory
should be compatible with psycholinguistic re-
search on language acquisition, treatment, pro-
duction, interpretation and memorization of lin-
guistic expressions. We agree with this view and
postulate that elaborating electronic dictionaries
on the ground of a linguistic theory, satisfying
Dik’s principle, will confer them good ergonomics
that will increase their usability. Our approach is
to some extent comparable to WordNet initiative
(Fellbaum, 1998), in the sense that we are trying
to characterize speakers’ mental lexicon.
In this paper, we focus on verb lexical orga-
nization through the examination of verbal pivot
metaphorical utterances (VPMU). Such utterances
involve an understudied structural aspect of the
lexicon: interdomain co-hyponymy (Duvignau,

2002; Duvignau and Gaume, 2008). In this
context, we take semantic proximity as a cen-
tral principle for cognitive ergonomics influenc-
ing dynamic lexical acquisition and adult lexical
organization. VPMU generally consists in substi-
tuting elements from different semantic domains.
They are usually considered as deviants while they
might constitute a linguistic illustration of the cat-
egorial flexibility advocated in (Piaget, 1945; Ny,
1979; Hofstadter, 1995). They might therefore
reveal an early lexical structuring mode that may
form a ground for improving electronic dictionar-
ies.
This paper presents a mathematical method able
to discover the areas in which this structuring
mode appears in dictionaries. Our approach is to
take advantage of the mathematical structure of the
network generated by verb definitions. This struc-
ture has been mentioned in (Watts and Strogatz,
1998), studied for WordNet by (Sigman and Cec-
chi, 2002), refined in (Gaume et al., 2002) and ex-
ploited in the current proposal.
The paper is organized as follows. The next sec-
tion brings evidence of categorization by seman-
tic proximity from early lexicon acquisition ex-
periments. Section 3 presents the computational
model, hereafter ’proxemy’. Section 4 details our
work on lexical graphs while section 5 compares
the results of experimental studies with those of
the computational model.
2 Toward a categorization by semantic
proximity: evidences from early lexicon
acquisition

proximation, we have chosen to support our claim

2.1 Inter-domains vs. intra-domain semantic
approximations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998302727272727">
Studies in this field are almost exclusively lim-
ited to nominal utterances. (Duvignau et al.,
2005) established the existence of the production
of metaphor-like utterances with a verbal pivot in
2-4 years-old children and proposed to consider
them, at this stage of language development, as se-
mantic approximations and not as mistakes or true
metaphors. Duvignau distinguished two kinds of
semantic approximations: Inter-domains proxim-
ity and intra domain proximity between verbs (Du-
vignau, 2002).

- Inter-domains proximity / co-hyponymy be-
tween verbs : a ’linguistic approximation’

orange) [Age: 3 years] [movie: a lady peels
an orange]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986734619047619">
In this category of approximation, the verb used
by the speaker constitutes a reference to a semantic
domain different from the one of element it is com-
bined to (’undress’ / ’orange’). For this reason, the
approximate character of the verb is understand-
able independently of the context of the utterance:
detecting the approximation occurs at the linguis-
tic level. We call this type of production ’semantic
approximation’. They might constitute a metaphor
or an ’analogic surextention’.
When someone has a conventional verb in the
mental lexicon (’to peel’) and use a non conven-
tional but relevant verb like ’to undress the orange’
for the action [to peel the orange his verbal seman-
tic approximation constitutes a metaphor. On the
contrary when someone does not have a conven-
tional verb in the mental lexicon but manages to
use a non conventional but relevant verb in saying
’to undress’ for this action, his verbal semantic ap-
proximation constitutes a ’surextension’ but not an
error because of the lexical relation that links these
verbs. In fact, according to (Duvignau and Gaume,
2008) ’to undress’ and ’to peel’ are related by an
inter-domains synonymic relation.
- Intra-domain proximity / co-hyponymy be-
tween verbs: a ’pragmatic approximation’ In
this category, illustrated by (2) the approximate
character of the verb comes only from a non-
correspondence between the verb used and the re-
ality it designates. This happens with utterances in
which the use of the verbal form does not create
any semantic tension within the utterance but des-
ignates a way of carrying out an activity that does
not correspond precisely to the action undertaken.
(2) Elle coupe l’orange (She cuts the or-
ange)[age: 3 years][movie: a lady peels an
orange]
We propose an experimental study of the produc-
tion of verbal semantic approximations like (2) or
(1) by way of a naming task of 17 action-movies
with young children (from 2 to 4 years old). We
compare their performances with adult’s ones.

2.2 Experimental Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99966075">
In order to elicit the production of semantic ap-
proximations we proposed to all our participants
an action-video naming task. The population sam-
ple consisted of:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99736125">
• 54 non-disturbed children (2-4 years old),
monolingual in French
• 77 non-disturbed young adults (18-40 years
old), monolingual in French

The action movies sequences are coming from the
Approx protocol (Duvignau et al., 2005). The ma-
terial consists in 17 action-movies sequences de-
scribed in table 1.
The 17 action movies are presented in random
order to each participant. Instructions were given
at the time the action in the movie was completed
and its results were visible (e.g when the glass is
broken). At that moment a question was asked
to the participant:’What did the woman do? (just
now)’

2.3 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999363">
Each of the children produced between 2 and 5 ap-
proximations: ’Elle casse la tomate’ -She breaks a
tomato ’ [action = to squash], ’Elle épluche le bois’
- She peels the wood’ [action = to strip the bark off
a log]. Globally, children produced semantic ap-
proximations for 34 % of the naming tasks, which
were distributed as follows: 24 % intra-domain
semantic approximations, 10 % inter-domains se-
mantic approximations. They produced them sig-
nificantly more frequent than adults : 5 % with
4% intra-domain semantic approximations and 1
% inter-domains semantic approximations.

The student Test shows the difference between
children and adults in terms of production of se-
mantic approximation is very significant: here p &lt;
0, 01 while p &lt; 0, 05 is enough.
These results signal the importance of seman-
tic approximations and of semantic proximity be-
tween verbs in the cognitive organization of verbs
lexicon.
In the rest of the paper we present a computa-
tional model of semantic proximity and then com-
pare this model with the experimental data ob-
tained from the children.

3 Proxemy: a computational approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838">
A theory of language useful for computational
work must account for language statistical regu-
larities. Zipf law (Zipf, 1949) satisfy this obser-
vation but provides little insight on lexical struc-
tural organization. More recent graph theory stud-
ies (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001; Sigman and
Cecchi, 2002), capitalizing on results in other sci-
entific domains, provided interesting contributions
to the establishment of such a theory of language.
All structures discovered in this field research sat-
isfy the “hierarchical small word” (HSW) defini-
tion (see section 3.1). Our approach takes place in
this general framework. Our specificities are:

that guides us and help us on our results vali-

ity among vertices (here vertices are French
verbs).

<bodyText confidence="0.999864875">
The study by (Resnik and Diab, 2000) signaled
that although existing models for verb similarity
performed reasonably well against human judg-
ments, none managed to handle certain types of
metaphorical pairs such as to undress / to peel off
that are nonetheless declared to be rather similar
by speakers. We aim to develop a model address-
ing this issue.

3.1 Small World Networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99915">
Networks corresponding to structures found in real
world (henceforth real world networks) are sparse:
in a graph with n nodes, the maximum num-
ber of possible edges is O(n2) while the number
of edges in real networks is generally inferior to
O(nlog(n)). Watts and Strogatz (Watts and Stro-
gatz, 1998) proposed two indicators to characterize
a large sparse graph G:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99161425">
• L : the characteristic path length, i.e the mean
of the shortest path between two nodes of G
• C : the clustering coefficient, C E [0, 1], it
measures the graph tendency to host zones
very dense in edges. (The more clustered the
graph is, the more the graph’s C approaches
1, whereas in random graphs C is very close
to 0).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6768825">
In applying these criteria to different types of
graphs, Watts and Strogatz found that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999841384615385">
• real world networks have a tendency to have
a small L: generally there is at least one short
path between any two nodes ;
• real world networks have a tendency to have
a large C: this reflects a relative tendency for
two neighbors on the same node to be inter-
connected;
• random graphs have a small L: If someone
builds a graph randomly with a density of
edges comparable to real world networks, it
will obtain graphs with a small L;
• random graphs have a small C: They are not
composed of aggregates. In a random graph

<page confidence="0.995805">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966148148148">
there is no reason why neighbors of a same
node are more likely to be connected than any
two other nodes, hence their poor tendency to
form aggregates.
Watts and Strogatz proposed to call the graphs
having these two characteristics (a small L and
a large C) small worlds (SW). They recognized
these SW in all the real world networks they ob-
served, and therefore postulated for being a SW
was an universal property of real world networks.
A complete presentation of Small Words can be
found, for example, in (Newman, 2003).
More recent research has shown that most SW
also have a hierarchical structure (hereafter hier-
archical small worlds, HSW ). The distribution
of the vertices incidence degrees follows a power
law. The probability P(k) that a given node has k
neighbors decreases as a power law, P(k) Pz� k−λ,
where A is a constant characteristic of the graph
(Barabási and Albert, 1999), while random graphs
conforms to a Poisson Law.
In the next section, we present ’proxemy’, a se-
mantic proximity measure based on a distance we
define. A interesting particularity of this distance
is to calculate the distance between two vertices on
the ground of the complete graph, and not only on
their direct neighbors.

3.2 The mathematical model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999696777777778">
PROX (PROXemy) is a stochastic method de-
signed for studying “Hierarchical Small Worlds”.1
This method takes graph as input and transform
them in a Markov chain whose states are graph ver-
tices. Metaphorically, energy particles wander ran-
domly from vertex to vertex through the edges of
the graph. It is their trajectory dynamics that give
us the structural properties of the graph.
PROX takes a graph in input and output a simi-
larity measure between the vertices of the graph.
Our problem is therefore the opposite than the
one of Pathfinder networks (PFNETs see (Schvan-
eveldt et al., 1988)). PFNETs take a full proximity
matrix in input and output a sparse graph. Their
goal is to minimize the number of edges required
in the sparse graph to be able to approximate the
full distance matrix corresponding to the initial full
proximity matrix.

obtained by PROX algorithm. It corresponds to some kind of
semantic proximity.

PROX build a similarity measure between the
vertices. The hypothesis is that areas having a
high density in edges (hereafter, these areas will
be called aggregates) correspond to closely related
verb meanings (in a graph of verbs).

Therefore when, PROX(G, t, r, s) &gt;

bility to be, at instant t on s than on u and it is
graph structure that determine these probabilities.
For the rest of this paper we will set the value
of t to 4 since L is less than 4 in the kind of
graph we are concerned with. Therefore, we take
into account the global graph simply by calculating
PROX(G; 4; r; s).

<bodyText confidence="0.99989262962963">
Meaning in dictionary definition is at least partially
brought by the relations they create between the
words constituting the entries. Our approach con-
sists in exploiting the small word properties of the
graphs corresponding to dictionaries. More pre-
cisely, we are taking advantage of our hypothe-
sis that aggregates correspond to areas of closely
related senses. We illustrate our approach on
two kinds of dictionary, two traditional dictionar-
ies, Le Grand Robert3 and TLFi4, and an syn-
onym dictionary (Dicosyn) made of compilation
of synonym relations extracted from seven other
dictionaries (Bailly, Benac, Du Chazaud, Guizot,
Lafaye, Larousse et Robert).5
We create a graph from a dictionary in the fol-
lowing way. The entries constituted the vertices.
Edges between two vertices A and B were added
if and only if B appears in A’s lemmatized defini-
tion6 as illustrated in Figure 4.1
We proceed in this way for each entry and ob-
tained a graph of the dictionary. By extracting the
subgraph composed only of verbs, the ’neighbor-
hood’ we get for the verb ’écorcer’ is illustrated
by Figure 4.1. Then we render the graph sym-
metric and reflexive. These modifications on the
graphs are allowed thanks to its paradigmatic na-
ture. Graphs created in this way are typical small

(Duvignau, 2002) has shown that co-hyponymy
verb lexical organization according fits with a
power law distribution of incidence degrees. In our
opinion, (i) the hierarchical organization of dictio-
naries is a consequence of the special role of the
hypernymy relation together with the polysemy of
some specific vertices; (ii) the strong C reflects
the role of interdomain co-hyponyny (Duvignau,
2002; Duvignau and Gaume, 2003). For example,
in French language, ’casser (to break)’ appears in
many definitions: ’émietter (to crumble)’, ’frag-
menter (to fragment)’, ’détériorer (to damage)’,
’révoquer (to dismiss)’, ’abroger (to abrogate)’.
This results in a very high incidence for the vertex
’casser (to break)’. Moreover, many triangles ex-
ist ( {casser, émietter, fragmenter}, {casser, révo-
quer, abroger}...,) and they help to create aggre-
gates. These areas that are bringing co-hyponyms
closer in the resulting graph.

Word Sense Disambiguation is a general issue for
natural language processing that we need to ad-

verb ’causer’: to cause (3) and to chat (4).

Of course, the word ’causer’ may appear in other
definitions like ’bavarder’ (to chat) . Although
a French speaker knows that the ’causer’ in (5)
refers to the definition (4) our system for building
the graph cannot disambiguate. The solution we
propose is to (i) first create a fictive vertex which
is not a dictionary entry and then (ii) adds two
edges {CAUSER, CAUSER-1} and {CAUSER,
CAUSER-2 }. When ’causer’ is found in another
definition like (5), we add the edge { BAVARDER,
CAUSER } as illustrated in Figure (5).

In Figure (5), many edges are hidden for clarity
reasons. Dashed edges ({Discuter, Causer2}) re-
sult from the fact ’Discuter’ and ’Parler’ are in the
definition of ’Causer-2’.
At this stage, we apply PROX to such graph as
the one Figure (5) in order to get a matrix [ ˆG4]
as defined in section 3.2. [ ˆG4] bavarder,causer−1 &lt;
[ ˆG4]bavarder,causer−2. This comparison allows us
to disambiguate.
More generally, let suppose we found a word
with k entries in a definition, we will then have
S1, ... , Sk vertices corresponding to the entries a
fictive vertex S. In case there is an edge {A, S}
it is replaced by {A, Si} where Si is such that
[ ˆG4]A,Si = MAX0&lt;i≤k{ ˆG4]A,Si}. Then we re-
move all fictive vertices from the graph to get a
disambiguated graph.

word of a word according to our proxemy mea-

Prox is a robust method: changing randomly a
few edges does not change significantly the results.
The repartition of aggregates is not strongly af-
fected by a random redistribution of some edges.
However the relevance of our proxemy approach
of lexical networks is tied to the linguistic rep-
resentativity of the networks we use. Therefore,
we tested the PROX model of four different dictio-

linguistic experimental results presented in section

For each of these graphs we looked at two vari-
ables to be related with the psycho-linguistics ex-
periments: the answers incidence and the proxim-
ity of answers to a ’reference verb’
Answers incidence We compare in the graph the
average incidence degree between adult (IDadult)
and children answers (IDchildren).

The proximity of answers to a ’reference verb’
Three linguist judges determined together for each
movie which was the most appropriate verb to de-
scribe the action performed in the movie (hereafter
Ri is the reference verb for the movie Mi). For
a given movie Mi, an answer may therefore be
ranked according to its proxemy according to Ri.
For a lexical graph G = (V, E) composed of n
words, and for a reference verb Ri ∈ V , one can
define rankRi for ranking all the vertices of V in
decreasing order resulting from a PROX iteration
PROX(G, t, Ri, •) on V (see section 3.2).

Our first hypothesis was that IDadult &lt;
IDchildren. According to the hypothesis children
would learn first words corresponding to high in-
cidence vertices. Then they would use them for
talking about an large lexical area (e.g ’casser’ (to
break) is used by children while adults use a more
precise verb like ’déchirer’ (to tear) which has a
lower incidence in dictionary graphs).
Our second hypothesis was that the mean of the
rank of the children answers according to the ref-
erence verb is higher that the adult ones. When a
child is attempting to communicate an event (e.g
déchirer un livre, to tear a book) for which he does
not have an already constituted verbal category, he
would do an analogy with a past event (e.g to break
a glass) and use this verb for describing the cur-
rent event (e.g casser un livre, to break a book).
The adult could use a number of more accurate
verbs but their proxemic rank, with regard to the
reference verb, is generally lower than the children
ones.
The table 2 shows the results concerning an-
swers incidence. Although some variability is ob-
served across the graphs, our first hypothesis is val-
idated for the 4 graphs. On the three first graphs
the average incidence of answers is roughly twice
as the adults one.
The table 3 illustrates the results concerning
proxemic rank of answers according to the ref-
erence verb. Again, in spite of some variability
across the graphs our second hypothesis is vali-
dated as well. Moreover, having in mind that the
graph has about 10 000 vertices, we observe that
although less close that adults answers, the chil-
dren answers remain relatively close to the refer-
ence verb according to our proxemic measure.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984333333333">
Our psycholinguistic approach allows us to estab-
lish that semantic proximity between verbs play a
fundamental role during the period of early lexi-
cal acquisition. We signaled the existence in the
organization of the lexicon of a relation of co-
hyponymy between verbs. Based on these first
observations we consider that productions based
on semantic proximity are particularly interesting:
they manifest the existence, at the surface level of
discourse, of a lexical relation of inter-domain ’se-
mantic proximity’ between verbs not yet consid-
ered in linguistics.
Moreover we have seen that semantic approxi-
mations for verbs appear to fit the proximity values
calculated by PROX. On the ground of these first
results, we postulate that constructing electronic
dictionaries on the ground of linguistic theory of
lexical semantic organization that fits with early
lexicon acquisition as well with adult lexical orga-
nization will provide them interesting ergonomics
properties. This should increase their usability and

might be taken into account for normalizing elec-
tronic dictionaries.
For example, we are developing a ’proxemic
electronic dictionary’ from TLFi. Such dictionar-
ies enable to find an uncommon but precise verb
like ’to bark’ by using (i) a common verb like ’to
undress’ which is related to ’to bark’ by seman-
tic proximity and (ii) a word (e.g ’tree’) bringing a
relevant semantic domain. Moreover, in the def-
inition of ’to bark’ one can find: ’tree’, ’grain’
’fruit’ which are close from each other accord-
ing to PROX ran on nouns. Finally, when we
look for verbs that are close from both ’to un-
dress’ and ’tree’, PROX provides the verbs: ’to
cut, to ring, to peel, to notch, to bark, to incise,...’
which constitute relevant verbs. Such a dictio-
nary can be useful for didactic studies where it can
complements approaches like and NLP for word
sense desambiguization (Gaume et al., 2004) or
de-metaphorization.

They recognized these SW in all the real world networks they observed, and therefore postulated for being a SW was an universal property of real world networks. A complete presentation of Small Words can be found, for example, in (Newman, 2003). More recent research has shown that most SW also have a hierarchical structure (hereafter hierarchical small worlds, HSW ). The distribution of the vertices incidence degrees follows a power law. The probability P(k) that a given node has k neighbors decreases as a power law, P(k) Pz� k−λ, where A is a constant characteristic of the graph (Barabási and Albert, 1999), while random graphs conforms to a Poisson Law. In the next section, we present ’proxemy’, a semantic proximity measure based on a distance we define. A interesting particularity of this distance is to calculate the distance between two vertices on the ground of the complete graph, and not only on their direct neighbors. 3.2 The mathematical model PROX (PROXemy) is a stochastic method designed for studying “Hierarchical Small Worlds”.1 This method takes graph as input and transform them in a Markov chain whose states are graph vertices.

Figure 2: Sub-graph of the verbs near ’écorcer’ from Robert (Duvignau, 2002) has shown that co-hyponymy verb lexical organization according fits with a power law distribution of incidence degrees. In our opinion, (i) the hierarchical organization of dictionaries is a consequence of the special role of the hypernymy relation together with the polysemy of some specific vertices; (ii) the strong C reflects the role of interdomain co-hyponyny (Duvignau, 2002; Duvignau and Gaume, 2003). For example, in French language, ’casser (to break)’ appears in many definitions: ’émietter (to crumble)’, ’fragmenter (to fragment)’, ’détériorer (to damage)’, ’révoquer (to dismiss)’, ’abroger (to abrogate)’. This results in a very high incidence for the vertex ’casser (to break)’. Moreover, many triangles exist ( {casser, émietter, fragmenter}, {casser, révoquer, abroger}...,) and they help to create aggregates.

Our approach is to some extent comparable to WordNet initiative (Fellbaum, 1998), in the sense that we are trying to characterize speakers’ mental lexicon. In this paper, we focus on verb lexical organization through the examination of verbal pivot metaphorical utterances (VPMU). Such utterances involve an understudied structural aspect of the lexicon: interdomain co-hyponymy (Duvignau, © 2008.

VPMU generally consists in substituting elements from different semantic domains. They are usually considered as deviants while they might constitute a linguistic illustration of the categorial flexibility advocated in (Piaget, 1945; Ny, 1979; Hofstadter, 1995).

When someone has a conventional verb in the mental lexicon (’to peel’) and use a non conventional but relevant verb like ’to undress the orange’ for the action [to peel the orange his verbal semantic approximation constitutes a metaphor. On the contrary when someone does not have a conventional verb in the mental lexicon but manages to use a non conventional but relevant verb in saying ’to undress’ for this action, his verbal semantic approximation constitutes a ’surextension’ but not an error because of the lexical relation that links these verbs. In fact, according to (Duvignau and Gaume, 2008) ’to undress’ and ’to peel’ are related by an inter-domains synonymic relation. - Intra-domain proximity / co-hyponymy between verbs: a ’pragmatic approximation’ In this category, illustrated by (2) the approximate character of the verb comes only from a noncorrespondence between the verb used and the reality it designates.

Zipf law (Zipf, 1949) satisfy this observation but provides little insight on lexical structural organization. More recent graph theory studies (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001; Sigman and Cecchi, 2002), capitalizing on results in other scientific domains, provided interesting contributions to the establishment of such a theory of language. All structures discovered in this field research satisfy the “hierarchical small word” (HSW) definition (see section 3.1). Our approach takes place in this general framework.

In a random graph 88 there is no reason why neighbors of a same node are more likely to be connected than any two other nodes, hence their poor tendency to form aggregates. Watts and Strogatz proposed to call the graphs having these two characteristics (a small L and a large C) small worlds (SW). They recognized these SW in all the real world networks they observed, and therefore postulated for being a SW was an universal property of real world networks. A complete presentation of Small Words can be found, for example, in (Newman, 2003). More recent research has shown that most SW also have a hierarchical structure (hereafter hierarchical small worlds, HSW ). The distribution of the vertices incidence degrees follows a power law. The probability P(k) that a given node has k neighbors decreases as a power law, P(k) Pz� k−λ, where A is a constant characteristic of the graph (Barabási and Albert, 1999), while random graphs conforms to a Poisson Law. In the next section, we present ’proxemy’, a semantic proximity measure based on a distance we define. A interesting particularity of this distance is to calculate the distance betw</context>

Metaphorically, energy particles wander randomly from vertex to vertex through the edges of the graph. It is their trajectory dynamics that give us the structural properties of the graph. PROX takes a graph in input and output a similarity measure between the vertices of the graph. Our problem is therefore the opposite than the one of Pathfinder networks (PFNETs see (Schvaneveldt et al., 1988)). PFNETs take a full proximity matrix in input and output a sparse graph. Their goal is to minimize the number of edges required in the sparse graph to be able to approximate the full distance matrix corresponding to the initial full proximity matrix. 1In this paper we will use the term ’proxemy’ to refer to the obtained by PROX algorithm. It corresponds to some kind of semantic proximity. PROX build a similarity measure between the vertices. The hypothesis is that areas having a high density in edges (hereafter, these areas will be called aggregates) correspond to closely related verb meanin</context>

(The more clustered the graph is, the more the graph’s C approaches 1, whereas in random graphs C is very close to 0).
