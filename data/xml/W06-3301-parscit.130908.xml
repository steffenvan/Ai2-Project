Most current definitional question an-
swering systems apply one-size-fits-all
lexicosyntactic patterns to identify defini-
tions. By analyzing a large set of online
definitions, this study shows that the se-
mantic types of definienda constrain both
lexical semantics and lexicosyntactic pat-
terns of the definientia. For example,
“heart” has the semantic type [Body Part,
Organ, or Organ Component] and its
definition (e.g., “heart locates between the
lungs”) incorporates semantic-type-
dependent lexicosyntactic patterns (e.g.,
“TERM locates ...”) and terms (e.g.,
“lung” has the same semantic type [Body
Part, Organ, or Organ Component]). In
contrast, “AIDS” has a different semantic
type [Disease or Syndrome]; its definition
(e.g., “An infectious disease caused by
human immunodeficiency virus”) consists
of different lexicosyntactic patterns (e.g.,
“...causes by...”) and terms (e.g., “infec-
tious disease” has the semantic type [Dis-
ease or Syndrome]). The semantic types
are defined in the widely used biomedical
knowledge resource, the Unified Medical
Language System (UMLS).

<bodyText confidence="0.999466346153846">
Definitional questions (e.g., “What is X?”) consti-
tute an important question type and have been a
part of the evaluation at the Text Retrieval Confer-
ence (TREC) Question Answering Track since
2003. Most systems apply one-size-fits-all lexico-
syntactic patterns to identify definitions (Liang et
al. 2001; Blair-Goldensohn et al. 2004;
Hildebrandt et al. 2004; Cui et al. 2005). For ex-
ample, the pattern “NP, (such as|like|including)
query term” can be used to identify the definition
“New research in mice suggests that drugs such as
Ritalin quiet hyperactivity” (Liang et al. 2001).
Few existing systems, however, have explored the
relations between the semantic type (denoted as
SDT) of a definiendum (i.e., a defined term (DT))
and the semantic types (denoted as SDef) of terms in
its definiens (i.e., definition). Additionally, few
existing systems have examined whether the lexi-
cosyntactic patterns of definitions correlate with
the semantic types of the defined terms.
By analyzing a large set of online definitions, this
study shows that 1) SDef correlates with SDT, and 2)
SDT constrains the lexicosyntactic patterns of the
corresponding definitions. In the following, we
will illustrate our findings with the following four
definitions:

In the above four definitions, the superscripts in
[brackets] are the semantic types (e.g., [Body Part,
Organ, or Organ Component] and [Disease or Syn-
drome]) of the preceding terms. A multiword term
links words with the underscore “_”. For example,
“heart” IS-A [Body Part, Organ, or Organ Compo-
nent] and “heart_muscle” IS-A [Tissue]. The se-
mantic types are defined in the Semantic Network
(SN) of the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS), the largest biomedical knowledge re-
source. Details of the UMLS and SN will be de-
scribed in Section 2. We applied MMTx (Aronson
et al. 2004) to automatically map a string to the
UMLS semantic types. MMTx will also be de-
scribed in Section 2.
Simple analysis of the above four definitions
shows that given a defined term (DT) with a se-
mantic type SDT (e.g., [Body Part, Organ, or Organ
Component]), terms that appear in the definition
tend to have the same or related semantic types
(e.g., [Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component]
and [Spatial Concept]). Such observations were
first reported as “Aristotelian definitions”
(Bodenreider and Burgun 2002) in the limited do-
main of anatomy. (Rindflesch and Fiszman 2003)
reported that the hyponym related to the definien-
dum must be in an IS-A relation with the hy-
pernym that is related to the definiens. However,
neither work demonstrated statistical patterns on a
large corpus as we report in this study. Addition-
ally, none of the work explicitly suggested the use
of patterns to support question answering.
In addition to statistical correlations among seman-
tic types, the lexicosyntactic patterns of the defini-
tions correlate with SDT. For example, as shown by
sentences a~d, when SDT is [Body Part, Organ, or
Organ Component], its lexicosyntactic patterns
include “...located...”. In contrast, when SDT is
[Disease or Syndrome], the patterns include
“...due to...” and “... caused by...”.
In this study, we empirically studied statistical cor-
relations between SDT and SDef and between SDT and
the lexicosyntactic patterns in the definitions. Our
study is a result of detailed statistical analysis of
36,535 defined terms and their 226,089 online
definitions. We built our semantic constraint model
based on the widely used biomedical knowledge
resource, the UMLS. We also adapted a robust in-
formation extraction system to generate automati-
cally a large number of lexicosyntactic patterns
from definitions. In the following, we will first
describe the UMLS and its semantic types. We will
then describe our data collection and our methods
for pattern generation.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999662705882353">
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is
the largest biomedical knowledge source main-
tained by the National Library of Medicine. It pro-
vides standardized biomedical concept relations
and synonyms (Humphreys et al. 1998). The
UMLS has been widely used in many natural lan-
guage processing tasks, including information re-
trieval (Eichmann et al. 1998), extraction
(Rindflesch et al. 2000), and text summarization
(Elhadad et al. 2004; Fiszman et al. 2004).
The UMLS includes the Metathesaurus (MT),
which contains over one million biomedical con-
cepts and the Semantic Network (SN), which
represents a high-level abstraction from the UMLS
Metathesaurus. The SN consists of 134 semantic
types with 54 types of semantic relations (e.g., is-a
or part-of) that relate the semantic types to each
other. The UMLS Semantic Network provides
broad and general world knowledge that is related
to human health. Each UMLS concept is assigned
one or more semantic types.
The National Library of Medicine also makes
available MMTx, a programming implementation
of MetaMap (Aronson 2001), which maps free text
to the UMLS concepts and associated semantic
types. MMTx first parses text into sentences, then
chunks the sentences into noun phrases. Each
noun phrase is then mapped to a set of possible
UMLS concepts, taking into account spelling and
morphological variations; each concept is
weighted, with the highest weight representing the
most likely mapped concept. One recent study has
evaluated MMTx to have 79% (Yu and Sable
2005) accuracy for mapping a term to the semantic

type(s) in a small set of medical questions. Another
study (Lacson and Barzilay 2005) measured
MMTx to have a recall of 74.3% for capturing the
semantic types in another set of medical texts.
In this study, we applied MMTx to identify the
semantic types of terms that appear in their defini-
tions. For each candidate term, MMTx ranks a list
of UMLS concepts with confidence. In this study,
we selected the UMLS concept that was assigned
with the highest confidence by MMTx. The UMLS
concepts were then used to obtain the correspond-
ing semantic types.

<bodyText confidence="0.999971928571429">
We collected a large number of online definitions
for the purpose of our study. Specifically, we ap-
plied more than 1 million of the UMLS concepts as
candidate definitional terms, and searched for the
definitions from the World Wide Web using the
Google:Definition service; this resulted in the
downloads of a total of 226,089 definitions that
corresponded to a total of 36,535 UMLS concepts
(or 3.7% of the total of 1 million UMLS concepts).
We removed from definitions the defined terms;
this step is necessary for our statistical studies,
which we will explain later in the following sec-
tions. We applied MMTx to obtain the correspond-
ing semantic types.

4 Statistically Correlated Semantic Types
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992946">
We then identified statistically correlated semantic
types between SDT and SDef based on bivariate tabu-
lar chi-square (Fleiss 1981).
Specifically, given a semantic type STYi, i=1,2,3,..., 134
of any defined term, the observed numbers of defi-
nitions that were and were not assigned the STYi
are O(Defi) and O(Defi). All indicates the total
226,089 definitions. The observed numbers of defi-
nitions in which the semantic type STYi, did and did
not appear were O(Alli) and O(Alli). 134 represents
the total number of the UMLS semantic types. We
applied formulas (1) and (2) to calculate expected
frequencies and then the chi-square value (the de-
gree of freedom is one). A high chi-square value
indicates the importance of the semantic type that
appears in the definition. We removed the defined
terms from their definitions prior to the semantic-
type statistical analysis in order to remove the bias
introduced by the defined terms (i.e., defined terms
frequently appear in the definitions).

<bodyText confidence="0.945835580645161">
To determine whether the chi-square value is large
enough for statistical significance, we calculated
its p-value. Typically, 0.05 is the cutoff of signifi-
cance, i.e. significance is accepted if the corre-
sponding p-value is less than 0.05. This criterion
ensures the chance of false significance (incor-
rectly detected due to chance) is 0.05 for a single
SDT-SDef pair. However, since there are 134*134
possible SDT-SDef pairs, the chance for obtaining at
least one false significance could be very high. To
have a more conservative inference, we employed
a Bonferroni-type correction procedure (Hochberg
1988).
Specifically, let p(1)≤p(2)≤ • • • 5 p(m) be the or-
dered raw p-values, where m is the total number of
SDT-SDef pairs. A SDef is significantly associated
with a SDT if SDef’s corresponding p-value
≤ p(i) ≤ α /(m − i + 1) for some i. This correction
procedure allows the probability of at-least-one-
false-significance out of the total m pairs is less
than alpha (=0.05).
The number of definitions for each SDT ranges from
4 ([Entity]), 10 ([Event]), 17 ([Vertebrate]) to
8,380 ([Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein]) and
18,461 ([Organic Chemical]) in our data collection.
As the power of a statistical test relies on the sam-
ple size, some correlated semantic types might be
undetected when the number of available defini-
tions is small. It is therefore worthwhile to know
what the necessary sample size is in order to have a
decent chance of detecting difference statistically.

For this task, we assume P0 and P1 are true prob-

Based upon that, we calculated the minimal re-
quired number of sentences n such that the prob-

or equal to 0.8. This sample size is determined
based on the following two assumptions: 1) the
observed frequencies are approximately normally

Our null hypothesis is that given any pair of

two different semantic types of the total 134 se-
mantic types, there are no statistical differences in
the distributions of the semantic types of the terms
that appear in the definitions.
We applied the bivariate tabular chi-square test to
measure the semantic type distribution. Following
similar notations to Section 4, we use OXi and OYi
for the corresponding frequencies of not being ob-
served in SDef(X) and SDef(Y).
For each semantic type STY, we calculate the ex-
pected frequencies of being observed and not being
observed in SDef(X) and SDef(Y), respectively, and
their corresponding chi-square value according to
formulas (3) and (4):

Our chi-square statistics show that for any pair of
semantic types {SDT(X), SDT(Y)}, X≠ Y, the distri-
butions of SDef are statistically different at al-
pha=0.05; the results show that the semantic types
of the defined terms correlate to the semantic types
in the definitions. Our results also show that the
syntactic patterns are distributed differently among
different semantic types of the defined terms (al-
pha=0.05).
Our results show that many semantic types that
appear in definitions are statistically correlated
with the semantic types of the defined terms. The
average number and standard deviation of statisti-
cally correlated semantic types is 80.6±35.4 at
P&lt;&lt;0.0001.
Figure 1 shows three SDT ([Body Part, Organ, or
Organ Component], [Disease or Syndrome], and
[Organization]) with the corresponding top five
statistically correlated semantic types that appear
in their definitions. Our results show that in a total
of 112 (or 83.6%) cases, SDT appears as one of the
top five statistically correlated semantic types in
SDef, and that in a total of 94 (or 70.1%) cases, SDT
appears at the top in SDef. Our results indicate that
if a definitional term has a semantic type SDT, then
the terms in its definition tend to have the same or
related semantic types.
We examined the cases in which the semantic
types of definitional terms do not appear in the top
five semantic types in the definitions. We found
that in all of those cases, the total numbers of defi-
nitions that were used for statistical analysis were
too small to obtain statistical significance. For ex-
ample, when SDT is “Entity”, the minimum size for
a SDef was 4.75, which is larger than the total num-
ber of the definitions (i.e., 4). As a result, some
actually correlated semantic types might be unde-
tected due to insufficient sample size.
Our results also show that the lexicosyntactic pat-
terns of definitional sentences are SDT-dependent.
Our results show that many lexicosyntactic pat-
terns that appear in definitions are statistically cor-
related with the semantic types of defined terms.
The average number and standard deviation of sta-
tistically correlated lexico-syntactic patterns is
1656.7±1818.9 at P&lt;&lt;0.0001. We found that the
more definitions an SDT has, the more lexicosyntac-
tic patterns.
Figure 2 shows the top 10 lexicosyntactic patterns
(based on chi-square statistics) that were captured
by Autoslog-TS with three different SDT; namely,
[Disease or Syndrome], [Body Part, Organ, or
Organ Component], and [Organization]. Figure 3
shows the top 10 lexicosyntactic patterns ranked
by AutoSlog-TS which incorporated the frequen-
cies of the patterns (Riloff and Philips 2004).
Figure 4 lists the top 30 common patterns across
all different semantic types SDT. We found that
many common lexicosyntactic patterns (e.g.,
“...known as...”, “...called”, “...include...”) have
been identified by other research groups through
either manual or semi-automatic pattern discovery
(Blair-Goldensohn et al. 2004).

The statistical correlations between SDT and SDef
may be useful to enhance the performance of a
definition-question-answering system by at least
two means. First, the semantic types may be useful
for word sense disambiguation. A simple applica-
tion is to rank definitional sentences based on the
distributions of the semantic types of terms in the
definitions to capture the definition of a specific
sense. For example, a biomedical definitional ques-
tion answering system may exclude the definition
of other senses (e.g., “feeling” as shown in the sen-
tence “The locus of feelings and intuitions; ‘in
your heart you know it is true’; ‘her story would
melt your heart.’”) if the semantic types that define
“heart” do not include [Body Part, Organ, or Organ
Component] of terms other than “heart”.
Secondly, the semantic-type correlations may be
used as features to exclude non-definitional sen-
tences. For example, a biomedical definitional
question answering system may exclude the fol-
lowing non-definitional sentence “Heart rate was

<bodyText confidence="0.999699794117647">
unaffected by the drug” because the semantic types
in the sentence do not include [Body Part, Organ,
or Organ Component] of terms other than “heart”.
SDT-dependent lexicosyntactic patterns may en-
hance both the recall and precision of a definitional
question answering system. First, the large sets of
lexicosyntactic patterns we generated automati-
cally may expand the smaller sets of lexicosyntac-
tic patterns that have been reported by the existing
question answering systems. Secondly, SDT-
dependent lexicosyntactic patterns may be used to
capture definitions.
The common lexicosyntactic patterns we identified
(in Figure 4) may be useful for a generic defini-
tional question answering system. For example, a
definitional question answering system may im-
plement the most common patterns to detect any
generic definitions; specific patterns may be im-
plemented to detect definitions with specific SDT.
One limitation of our work is that the lexicosyntac-
tic patterns generated by Autoslog-TS are within
clauses. This is a disadvantage because 1) lexico-
syntactic patterns can extend beyond clauses (Cui
et al. 2005) and 2) frequently a definition has mul-
tiple lexicosyntactic patterns. Many of the patterns
might not be generalizible. For example, as shown
in Figure 2, some of the top ranked patterns (e.g.,
“Subj_AuxVp_&lt;dobj&gt;_BE_ARMY&gt;”) identified
by AutoSlog-TS may be too specific to the text
collection. The pattern-ranking method introduced
by AutoSlog-TS takes into consideration the fre-
quency of a pattern and therefore is a better rank-
ing method than the chi-square ranking (shown in
Figure 3).

2002; Rindflesch and Fiszman 2003) who observed
that the principle nouns in definientia are fre-
quently semantically related (e.g., hyponyms, hy-
pernyms, siblings, and synonyms) to definiena.
Semantic constraints have been introduced to defi-
nitional question answering (Prager et al. 2000;
Liang et al. 2001). For example, an artist’s work
must be completed between his birth and death
(Prager et al. 2000); and the hyponyms of defined
terms might be incorporated in the definitions
(Liang et al. 2001). Semantic correlations have
been explored in other areas of NLP. For example,
researchers (Turney 2002; Yu and Hatzivassi-
loglou 2003) have identified semantic correlation
between words and views: positive words tend to
appear more frequently in positive movie and
product reviews and newswire article sentences
that have a positive semantic orientation and vice
versa for negative reviews or sentences with a
negative semantic orientation.

10 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945035714286">
This is the first study in definitional question an-
swering that concludes that the semantics of a de-
finiendum constrain both the lexical semantics and
the lexicosyntactic patterns in the definition. Our
discoveries may be useful for the building of a
biomedical definitional question answering system.
Although our discoveries (i.e., that the semantic
types of the definitional terms determine both the
lexicosyntactic patterns and the semantic types in
the definitions) were evaluated with the knowledge
framework from the biomedical, domain-specific
knowledge resource the UMLS, the principles may
be generalizable to any type of semantic classifica-
tion of definitions. The semantic constraints may
enhance both recall and precision of one-size-fits-
all question answering systems, which may be
evaluated in future work.
As stated in the Discussion session, one disadvan-
tage of this study is that the lexicosyntactic pat-
terns generated by Autoslog-TS are within clauses.
Future work needs to develop pattern-recognition
systems that are capable of detecting patterns
across clauses.
In addition, future work needs to move beyond
lexicosyntactic patterns to extract semantic-
lexicosyntactic patterns and to evaluate how the
semantic-lexicosyntactic patterns can enhance
definitional question answering.

The UMLS Semantic Network provides broad and general world knowledge that is related to human health. Each UMLS concept is assigned one or more semantic types. The National Library of Medicine also makes available MMTx, a programming implementation of MetaMap (Aronson 2001), which maps free text to the UMLS concepts and associated semantic types. MMTx first parses text into sentences, then chunks the sentences into noun phrases. Each noun phrase is then mapped to a set of possible UMLS concepts, taking into account spelling and morphological variations; each concept is weighted, with the highest weight representing the most likely mapped concept.

The semantic types are defined in the widely used biomedical knowledge resource, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). 1 Introduction Definitional questions (e.g., “What is X?”) constitute an important question type and have been a part of the evaluation at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Question Answering Track since 2003. Most systems apply one-size-fits-all lexicosyntactic patterns to identify definitions (Liang et al. 2001; Blair-Goldensohn et al. 2004; Hildebrandt et al. 2004; Cui et al. 2005). For example, the pattern “NP, (such as|like|including) query term” can be used to identify the definition “New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet hyperactivity” (Liang et al. 2001). Few existing systems, however, have explored the relations between the semantic type (denoted as SDT) of a definiendum (i.e., a defined term (DT)) and the semantic types (denoted as SDef) of terms in its definiens (i.e., definition). Additionally, few existing systems have examined whether the lexicosyntactic patterns of definitions correlate with the semantic types of the defined terms. B</context>

The common lexicosyntactic patterns we identified (in Figure 4) may be useful for a generic definitional question answering system. For example, a definitional question answering system may implement the most common patterns to detect any generic definitions; specific patterns may be implemented to detect definitions with specific SDT. One limitation of our work is that the lexicosyntactic patterns generated by Autoslog-TS are within clauses. This is a disadvantage because 1) lexicosyntactic patterns can extend beyond clauses (Cui et al. 2005) and 2) frequently a definition has multiple lexicosyntactic patterns. Many of the patterns might not be generalizible.

The UMLS has been widely used in many natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval (Eichmann et al. 1998), extraction (Rindflesch et al. 2000), and text summarization (Elhadad et al. 2004; Fiszman et al. 2004). The UMLS includes the Metathesaurus (MT), which contains over one million biomedical concepts and the Semantic Network (SN), which represents a high-level abstraction from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The SN consists of 134 semantic types with 54 types of semantic relations (e.g., is-a or part-of) that relate the semantic types to each other. The UMLS Semantic Network provides broad and general world knowledge that is related to human health. Each UMLS concept is assigned one or more semantic types.

Typically, 0.05 is the cutoff of significance, i.e. significance is accepted if the corresponding p-value is less than 0.05. This criterion ensures the chance of false significance (incorrectly detected due to chance) is 0.05 for a single SDT-SDef pair. However, since there are 134*134 possible SDT-SDef pairs, the chance for obtaining at least one false significance could be very high. To have a more conservative inference, we employed a Bonferroni-type correction procedure (Hochberg 1988). Specifically, let p(1)≤p(2)≤ • • • 5 p(m) be the ordered raw p-values, where m is the total number of SDT-SDef pairs. A SDef is significantly associated with a SDT if SDef’s corresponding p-value ≤ p(i) ≤ α /(m − i + 1) for some i. This correction procedure allows the probability of at-least-onefalse-significance out of the total m pairs is less than alpha (=0.05). The number of definitions for each SDT ranges from 4 ([Entity]), 10 ([Event]), 17 ([Vertebrate]) to 8,380 ([Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein]) and 18,461 ([Organic Chemical]) in our data collection.

In this study, we automatically generated large sets of lexicosyntactic patterns from our collection of online definitions.

For each semantic type, the relevant text incorporated the definitions, and the non-relevant text incorporated an equal number of sentences that were randomly selected from the MEDLINE collection.

One recent study has evaluated MMTx to have 79% (Yu and Sable 2005) accuracy for mapping a term to the semantic 2 type(s) in a small set of medical questions. Another study (Lacson and Barzilay 2005) measured MMTx to have a recall of 74.3% for capturing the semantic types in another set of medical texts. In this study, we applied MMTx to identify the semantic types of terms that appear in their definitions. For each candidate term, MMTx ranks a list of UMLS concepts with confidence. In this study, we selected the UMLS concept that was assigned with the highest confidence by MMTx. The UMLS concepts were then used to obtain the corresponding semantic types. 3 D</context>
