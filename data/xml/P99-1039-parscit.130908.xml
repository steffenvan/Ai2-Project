The paper shows that movement or equivalent
computational structure-changing operations of any
kind at the level of logical form can be dispensed
with entirely in capturing quantifier scope ambi-
guity. It offers a new semantics whereby the ef-
fects of quantifier scope alternation can be obtained
by an entirely monotonic derivation, without type-
changing rules. The paper follows Fodor (1982),
Fodor and Sag (1982), and Park (1995, 1996) in
viewing many apparent scope ambiguities as arising
from referential categories rather than true general-
ized quantifiers.

It is standard to assume that the ambiguity of sen-
tences like (1) is to be accounted for by assigning
two logical forms which differ in the scopes as-
signed to these quantifiers, as in (2a,b): I

The question then arises of how a grammar/parser
can assign all and only the correct interpretations to
sentences with multiple quantifiers.
This process has on occasion been explained
in terms of &amp;quot;quantifier movement&amp;quot; or essentially

&apos;The notation uses juxtaposition fa to indicate application
of a functor f to an argument a. Constants are distinguished
from variables by a prime, and semantic functors like admires&apos;
are assumed to be &amp;quot;Curried&amp;quot;. A convention of &amp;quot;left associativi-
ty&amp;quot; is assumed, so that admires&apos;yx is equivalent to (admires&apos; y)x.
equivalent computational operations of &amp;quot;quantify-
ing in&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;storage&amp;quot; at the level of logical form.
However, such accounts present a problem for
monostratal and monotonic theories of grammar
like CCG that try to do away with movement or
the equivalent in syntax. Having eliminated non-
monotonic operations from the syntax, to have to
restore them at the level of logical form would be
dismaying, given the strong assumptions of trans-
parency between syntax and semantics from which
the monotonic theories begin. Given the assump-
tions of syntactic/semantic transparency and mono-
tonicity that are usual in the Frege-Montague tra-
dition, it is tempting to try to use nothing but the
derivational combinatorics of surface grammar to
deliver all the readings for ambiguous sentences like
(1). Two ways to restore monotonicity have been
proposed, namely: enriching the notion of deriva-
tion via type-changing operations; or enriching the
lexicon and the semantic ontology.
It is standard in the Frege-Montague tradition to
begin by translating expressions like &amp;quot;every boy&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;some saxophonist&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;generalized quanti-
fiers&amp;quot; in effect exchanging the roles of arguments
like NPs and functors like verbs by a process of
&amp;quot;type-raising&amp;quot; the former. In terms of the notation
and assumptions of Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mar (CCG, Steedman 1996) the standard way to in-
corporate generalized quantifiers into the semantics
of CG deterMiners is to transfer type-raising to the
lexicon, assigning the following categories to deter-
miners like every and some, making them functions
from nouns to &amp;quot;type-raised&amp;quot; noun-phrases, where
the latter are simply the syntactic types correspond-
ing to a generalized quantifier:

(T is a variable over categories unique to each in-
dividual occurrence of the raised categories (3) and
(4), abbreviating a finite number of different raised
types. We will distinguish such distinct variables as
T, T&apos;, as necessary.)
Because CCG adds rules of function composition
to the rules of functional application that are stan-
dard in pure Categorial Grammar, the further in-
clusion of type-raised arguments engenders deriva-
tions in which objects command subjects, as well as
more traditional ones in which the reverse is true.
Given the categories in (3) and (4), these alterna-
tive derivations will deliver the two distinct logi-
cal forms shown in (2), entirely monotonically and
without involving structure-changing operations.
However, linking derivation and scope as simply
and directly as this makes the obviously false pre-
diction that in sentences where there is no ambi-
guity of CCG derivation there should be no scope
ambiguity. In particular, object topicalization and
object right node raising are derivationally unam-
biguous in the relevant respects, and force the dis-
placed object to command the rest of the sentence
in derivational terms. So they should only have the
wide scope reading of the object quantifier. This is
not the case:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.525934666666667">
(5) a. Some saxophonist, every boy admires.
b. Every boy admires, and every girl detests,
some saxophonist.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999502">
Both sentences have a narrow scope reading in
which every individual has some attitude towards
some saxophonist, but not necessarily the same sax-
ophonist. This observation appears to imply that
even the relatively free notion of derivation provided
by CCG is still too restricted to explain all ambigu-
ities arising from multiple quantifiers.
Nevertheless, the idea that semantic quantifier
scope is limited by syntactic derivational scope has
some very attractive features. For example, it imme-
diately explains why scope alternation is both un-
bounded and sensitive to island constraints. There
is a further property of sentence (5b) which was
first observed by Geach (1972), and which makes
it seem as though scope phenomena are strongly re-
stricted by surface grammar. While the sentence has
one reading where all of the boys and girls have
strong feelings toward the same saxophonist—say,
John Coltrane—and another reading where their
feelings are all directed at possibly different saxo-
phonists, it does not have a reading where the sax-
ophonist has wide scope with respect to every boy,
but narrow scope with respect to every girl—that
is, where the boys all admire John Coltrane, but
the girls all detest possibly different saxophonists.
There does not even seem to be a reading involving
separate wide-scope saxophonists respectively tak-
ing scope over boys and girls—for example where
the boys all admire Coltrane and the girls all detest
Lester Young.
These observations are very hard to reconcile
with semantic theories that invoke powerful mech-
anisms like abstraction or &amp;quot;Quantifying In&amp;quot; and its
relatives, or &amp;quot;Quantifier Movement.&amp;quot; For example,
if quantifiers are mapped from syntactic levels to
canonical subject, object etc. position at predicate-
argument structure in both conjuncts in (5b), and
then migrate up the logical form to take either wide
or narrow scope, then it is not clear why some saxo-
phonist should have to take the same scope in both
conjuncts. The same applies if quantifiers are gener-
ated in situ, then lowered to their surface position.2
Related observations led Partee and Rooth
(1983), and others to propose considerably more
general use of type-changing operations than are
required in CCG, engendering considerably more
flexibility in derivation that seems to be required by
the purely syntactic phenomena that have motivated
CCG up till now.3
While the tactic of including such order-
preserving type-changing operations in the gram-
mar remains a valid alternative for a monotonic
treatment of scope alternation in CCG and related
forms of categorial grammar, there is no doubt that
it complicates the theory considerably. The type-
changing operations necessarily engender infinite
sets of categories for each word, requiring heuris-
tics based on (partial) orderings on the operations
concerned, and raising questions about complete-
ness and practical parsability. All of these ques-
tions have been addressed by Hendriks and others,
but the result has been to dramatically raise the ratio
of mathematical proofs to sentences analyzed.
It seems worth exploring an alternative response
to these observations concerning interactions of sur-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.987037">
2Such observations have been countered by the invocation
of a &amp;quot;parallelism condition&amp;quot; on coordinate sentences, a rule of
a very expressively powerful &amp;quot;transderivational&amp;quot; kind that one
would otherwise wish to avoid.
3For example, in order to obtain the narrow scope object
reading for sentence (5b), Hendriks (1993), subjects the cate-
gory of the transitive verb to &amp;quot;argument lifting&amp;quot; to make it a
function over a type-raised object type, and the coordination
rule must be correspondingly semantically generalized.

face structure and scope-taking. The present paper
follows Fodor (1982), Fodor and Sag (1982), and
Park (1995, 1996) in explaining scope ambiguities
in terms of a distinction between true generalized
quantifiers and other purely referential categories.
For example, in order to capture the narrow-scope
object reading for Geach&apos;s right node raised sen-
tence (5b), in whose CCG derivation the object must
command everything else, the present paper fol-
lows Park in assuming that the narrow scope read-
ing arises from a non-quantificational interpretation
of some saxophonist, one which gives rise to a read-
ing indistinguishable from a narrow scope reading
when it ends up in the object position at the level
of logical form. The obvious candidate for such a
non-quantificational interpretation is some kind of
referring expression.
The claim that many noun-phrases which have
been assumed to have a single generalized quan-
tifier interpretation are in fact purely referential is
not new. Recent literature on the semantics of
natural quantifiers has departed considerably from
the earlier tendency for semanticists to reduce all
semantic distinctions of nominal meaning such as
de clicto/de re, reference/attribution, etc. to dis-
tinctions in scope of traditional quantifiers. There
is widespread recognition that many such distinc-
tions arise instead from a rich ontology of different
types of (collective, distributive, intensional, group-
denoting, arbitrary, etc.) individual to which nom-
inal expressions refer. (See for example Webber
1978, Barwise and Perry 1980, Fodor and Sag 1982,
Fodor 1982, Fine 1985, and papers in the recent col-
lection edited by Szabolcsi 1997.)
One example of such non-traditional entity types
(if an idea that apparently originates with Aristotle
can be called non-traditional) is the notion of &amp;quot;arbi-
trary objects&amp;quot; (Fine 1985). An arbitrary object is an
object with which properties can be associated but
whose extensional identity in terms of actual objects
is unspecified. In this respect, arbitrary objects re-
semble the Skolem terms that are generated by in-
ference rules like Existential Elimination in proof
theories of first-order predicate calculus.
The rest of the paper will argue that arbitrary ob-
jects so interpreted are a necessary element of the
ontology for natural language semantics, and that
their involvement in CCG explains not only scope
alternation (including occasions on which scope al-
ternation is not available), but also certain cases of
anomalous scopal binding which are unexplained
under any of the alternatives discussed so far.
2 Donkeys as Skolem Terms
One example of an indefinite that is probably better
analyzed as an arbitrary object than as a quantified
NP occurs in the following famous sentence, first
brought to modern attention by Geach (1962):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962314">
(6) Every farmer who owns a donkey, beats it,.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892875">
The pronoun looks as though it might be a variable
bound by an existential quantifier associated with a
donkey. However, no purely combinatoric analysis
in terms of the generalized quantifier categories of-
fered earlier allows this, since the existential cannot
both remain within the scope of the universal, and
come to c-command the pronoun, as is required for
true bound pronominal anaphora, as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.900566">
(7) Every farmer, in the room thinks that she, de-
serves a subsidy
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993983">
One popular reaction to this observation has been
to try to generalize the notion of scope, as in Dy-
namic Predicate Logic (DPL). Others have pointed
out that donkey pronouns in many respects look
more like non-bound-variable or discourse-bound
pronouns, in examples like the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.769983">
(8) Everybody who knows Gilbert, likes him,.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999661052631579">
I shall assume for the sake of argument that &amp;quot;a
donkey&amp;quot; translates at predicate-argument structure
as something we might write as arb&apos; donkey&apos; . I
shall assume that the function arb&apos; yields a Skolem
term—that is, a term applying a unique functor to
all variables bound by universal quantifiers in whose
extent arb&apos; donkey&apos; falls. Call it skdonkeyx in this case,
where skdonkey maps individual instantiations of x—
that is, the variable bound by the generalized quan-
tifier every farmer—onto objects with the property
donkey&apos; in the database.4
An ordinary discourse-bound pronoun may be
bound to this arbitrary object, but unless the pro-
noun is in the scope of the quantifiers that bind any
variables in the Skolem term, it will include a vari-
able that is outside the scope of its binder, and fail
to refer.
This analysis is similar to but distinct from
the analyses of Cooper (1979) and Heim (1990),

mechanism whereby a bound variable pronoun &amp;quot;knows&amp;quot; about
its binder. Whatever this mechanism is, it does not have the
power of movement, abstraction, or storage. An arbitrary ob-
ject is deterministically bound to all scoping universals.

who assume that a donkey translates as a quanti-
fied expression, and that the entire subject every
farmer who owns a donkey establishes a contextu-
ally salient function mapping farmers to donkeys,
with the donkey/E-type pronoun specifically of the
type of such functions. However, by making the
pronoun refer instead to a Skolem term or arbitrary
object, we free our hands to make the inferences
we draw on the basis of such sentences sensitive to
world knowledge. For example, if we hear the stan-
dard donkey sentence and know that farmers may
own more than one donkey, we will probably in-
fer on the basis of knowledge about what makes
people beat an arbitrary donkey that she beats all
of them. On the other hand, we will not make a
parallel inference on the basis of the following sen-
tence (attributed to Jeff Pelletier), and the knowl-
edge that some people have more than one dime in
their pocket.

The reason is that we know that the reason for
putting a dime into a parking meter, unlike the rea-
son for beating a donkey, is voided by the act itself.
The proposal to translate indefinites as Skolem
term-like discourse entities is anticipated in much
early work in Artificial Intelligence and Compu-
tational Linguistics, including Kay (1973), Woods
(1975 p.76-77), VanLehn (1978), and Webber
(1983, p.353, cf. Webber 1978, p.2.52), and also
by Chierchia (1995), Schlenker (1998), and in un-
published work by Kratzer. Skolem functors are
closely related to, but distinct from, &amp;quot;Choice Func-
tions&amp;quot; (see Reinhart 1997, Winter 1997, Sauerland
1998, and Schlenker 1998 for discussion. Webber&apos;s
1978 analysis is essentially a choice functional anal-
ysis, as is Fine&apos;s.)

If indefinites can be assumed to have a referen-
tial translation as an arbitrary object, rather than a
meaning related to a traditional existential gener-
alized quantifier, then other supposed quantifiers,
such as some/a few/two saxophonists may also be
better analyzed as referential categories.
We will begin by assuming that some is not a
quantifier, but rather a determiner of a (singular) ar-
bitrary object. It therefore has the following pair of
subject and complement categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9992705">
(10) a. some := (T I (T\NP))1N :4.4.q(arb&apos; p)
b. some := (TVT INP))IN :Xp.A,q.q(arb&apos; p)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997628818181818">
In this pair of categories, the constant arb&apos; is the
function identified earlier from properties p to en-
tities of type e with that property, such that those
entities are functionally related to any universally
quantified NPs that have scope over them at the level
of logical form. If aril p is not in the extent of any
universal quantifier, then it yields a unique arbitrary
constant individual.
We will assume that every has at least the gen-
eralized quantifier determiner given at (3), repeated
here:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9914815">
(11) a. every := (T I (T\NP))I N :
Ap.A.q.Vx.px qx
b. every := (TVT INP))IN :
kp.A,q.Vx.px qx
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997556">
These assumptions, as in Park&apos;s related account,
provide everything we need to account for all and
only the readings that are actually available for the
Geach sentence (5b), repeated here:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8392705">
(12) Every boy admires, and every girl detests,
some saxophonist.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996792392857143">
The &amp;quot;narrow-scope saxophonist&amp;quot; reading of this
sentence results from the (backward) referential cat-
egory (10b) applying to the translation of Every boy
admires and every girl detests of type S/NP (whose
derivation is taken as read), as in (13). Crucially, if
we evaluate the latter logical form with respect to a
database after this reduction, as indicated by the dot-
ted underline, for each boy and girl that we exam-
ine and test for the property of admiring/detesting
an arbitrary saxophonist, we will find (or in the
sense of Lewis (1979) &amp;quot;accommodate&amp;quot; or add to our
database) a potentially different individual, depen-
dent via the Skolem functors skis., and sk, upon
that boy or girl. Each conjunct thereby gives the
appearance of including a variable bound by an ex-
istential within the scope of the universal.
The &amp;quot;wide-scope saxophonist&amp;quot; reading arises
from the same categories as follows. If Skolem-
ization can act after reduction of the object, when
the arbitrary object is within the scope of the uni-
versal, then it can also act before, when it is not in
scope, to yield a Skolem constant, as in (14). Since
the resultant logical form is in all important respects
model-theoretically equivalent to the one that would
arise from a wide scope existential quantification,
we can entirely eliminate the quantifier reading (4)
for some, and regard it as bearing only the arbitrary
object reading (10).5

Consistent with Geach&apos;s observation, these cate-
gories do not yield a reading in which the boys ad-
mire the same wide scope saxophonist but the girls
detest possibly different ones. Nor do they yield
one in which the girls also all detest the same sax-
ophonist, but not necessarily the one the boys ad-
mire. Both facts are necessary consequences of the
monotonic nature of CCG as a theory of grammar,
without any further assumptions of parallelism con-
ditions.
In the case of the following scope-inverting rel-
ative of the Geach example, the outcome is subtly
different.

some man detests, before combination with the gen-

two Skolem constants, say sky&apos;oman and sk,t nan liking
every saxophonist, again without the involvement of
a true existential quantifier:

These readings are obviously correct. However,
since Skolemization of the arbitrary man and
woman has so far been assumed to be free to occur
any time, it seems to be predicted that one arbitrary
object might become a Skolem constant in advance
of reduction with the object, while the other might
do so after. This would give rise to further read-
ings in which only one of some man or some woman
takes wide scope—for example:6

Steedman (1991) shows on the basis of pos-
sible accompanying intonation contours that the
coordinate fragments like Some woman likes and
some man detests that result from right node rais-
ing are identical with information structural units
of utterances—usually, the &amp;quot;theme.&amp;quot; In the present
framework, readings like (18) can therefore be elim-
inated without parallelism constraints, by the further
assumption that Skolernization/binding of arbitrary
objects can only be done over complete information
structural units—that is, entire themes, rhemes, or
utterances. When any such unit is resolved in this
way, all arbitrary objects concerned are obligatorily
bound.7
While this account of indefinites might appear to
mix derivation and evaluation in a dangerous way,
this is in fact what we would expect from a mono-
The non-availability of such readings has also been used
to argue for parallelism constraints. Quite apart from the the-
oretically problematic nature of such constraints, they must be
rather carefully formulated if they are not to exclude perfectly
legal conjunction of narrow scope existentials with explicitly
referential NPs, as in the following:

tonic semantics that supports the use of incremental
semantic interpretation to guide parsing, as humans
appear to (see below).
Further support for a non-quantificational analy-
sis of indefinites can be obtained from the observa-
tion that certain nominals that have been talked of
as quantifiers entirely fail to exhibit scope alterna-
tions of the kind just discussed. One important class
is the &amp;quot;non-specific&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;non-group-denoting count-
ing&amp;quot; quantifiers, including the upward-monotone,
downward-monotone, and non-monotone quanti-
fiers (Barwise and Cooper 1981) such as at least
three, few, exactly five and at most two in examples
like the following, which are of a kind discussed by
Liu (1990), Stabler (1997), and Beghelli and Stow-

guages that are known to any linguist, and (19b)
cannot mean that there are at least three/few/exactly
five languages. languages that most linguists speak.
Beghelli and Stowell (1997) account for this be-
havior in terms of different &amp;quot;landing sites&amp;quot; (or in GB
terms &amp;quot;functional projections&amp;quot;) at the level of LF for
the different types of quantifier. However, another
alternative is to believe that in syntactic terms these
noun-phrases have the same category as any other
but in semantic terms they are (plural) arbitrary ob-
jects rather than quantifiers, like some, a few, six and
the like. This in turn means that they cannot engen-
der dependency in the arbitrary object arising from
some linguist in (19a). As a result the sentence has a
single meaning, to the effect that there is an arbitrary
linguist who can program in at most two program-
ming languages.

4 Computing Available Readings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989893577777778">
We may assume (at least for English) that even
the non-standard constituents created by function
composition in CCG cannot increase the number
of quantifiable arguments for an operator beyond
the limit of three or so imposed by the lexicon. It
follows that the observation of Park (1995, 1996)
that only quantified arguments of a single (possi-
bly composed) function can freely alternate scope
places an upper bound on the number of readings.
The logical form of an n-quantifier sentence is a
term with an operator of valency 1, 2 or 3, whose ar-
gument(s) must either be quantified expressions or
terms with an operator of valency 1, 2 or 3, and so
on. The number of readings for an n quantifier sen-
tence is therefore bounded by the number of nodes
in a single spanning tree with a branching factor b
of up to three and n leaves. This number is given
by a polynomial whose dominating term is 121&amp;quot;go—
that is, it is linear in n, albeit with a rather large
constant (since nodes correspond up to 3! = 6 read-
ings). For the relatively small n that we in practice
need to cope with, this is still a lot of readings in the
worst case.
However, the actual number of readings for real
sentences will be very much lower, since it depends
on how many true quantifiers are involved, and in
exactly what configuration they occur. For example,
the following three-quantifier sentence is predicted
to have not 3! = 6 but only 4 distinct readings, since
the non-quantifiers exactly three girls and some
book cannot alternate scope with each other inde-
pendently of the truly quantificational dependency-
inducing Every boy.
(20) Every boy gave exactly three girls some book.
This is an important saving for the parser, as redun-
dant analyses can be eliminated on the basis of iden-
tity of logical forms, a standard method of eliminat-
ing such &amp;quot;spurious ambiguities.&amp;quot;
Similarly, as well as the restrictions that we have
seen introduced by coordination, the SVO grammar
of English means (for reasons discussed in Steed-
man 1996) that embedded subjects in English are
correctly predicted neither to extract nor take scope
over their matrix subject in examples like the fol-
lowing:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.81194825">
(21) a. *a boy who(m) I know that admires John
Coltrane
b. Somebody knows that every boy admires
some saxophonist.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997519">
As Cooper 1983 points out, the latter has no read-
ings where every boy takes scope over somebody.
This three-quantifier sentence therefore has not 3! =
6, not 2! * 2! = 4, but only 2! * 1 = 2 readings.
Bayer (1996) and Kayne (1998) have noted related

<bodyText confidence="0.989745870370371">
restrictions on scope alternation that would other-
wise be allowed for arguments that are marooned in
mid verb-group in German. Since such embeddings
are crucial to obtaining proliferating readings, it is
likely that in practice the number of available read-
ings is usually quite small.
It is interesting to speculate finally on the relation
of the above account of the available scope readings
with proposals to minimize search during process-
ing by building &amp;quot;underspecified&amp;quot; logical forms by
Reyle (1992), and others cited in Willis and Man-
andhar (1999). There is a sense in which arbitrary
individuals are themselves under-specified quanti-
fiers, which are disambiguated by Skolemization.
However, under the present proposal, they are dis-
ambiguated during the derivation itself.
The alternative of building a single under-
specified logical form can under some circum-
stances dramatically reduce the search space and
increase efficiency of parsing—for example with
distributive expressions in sentences like Six girls
ate five pizzas, which are probably intrinsically un-
specified. However, few studies of this kind have
looked at the problems posed by the restrictions on
available readings exhibited by sentences like (5b).
The extent to which inference can be done with the
under-specified representations themselves for the
quantifier alternations in question (as opposed to
distributives) is likely to be very limited. If they
are to be disambiguated efficiently, then the disam-
biguated representations must embody or include
those restrictions. However, the restriction that
Geach noted seems intrinsically disjunctive, and
hence appears to threaten efficiency in both parsing
with, and disambiguation of, under-specified repre-
sentations.
The fact that relatively few readings are available
and that they are so tightly related to surface struc-
ture and derivation means that the technique of in-
cremental semantic or probabilistic disambiguation
of fully specified partial logical forms mentioned
earlier may be a more efficient technique for com-
puting the contextually relevant readings. For ex-
ample, in processing (22) (adapted from Hobbs and
Shieber 1987), which Park 1995 claims to have only
four readings, rather than the five predicted by their
account, such a system can build both readings for
the S 1 NP every representative of three companies
saw and decide which is more likely, before build-
ing both compatible readings of the whole sentence
and similarly resolving with respect to statistical or
contextual support:
(22) Every representative of three companies saw
some sample.

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999965333333333">
The above observations imply that only those so-
called quantifiers in English which can engender
dependency-inducing scope inversion have interpre-
tations corresponding to genuine quantifiers. The
others are not quantificational at all, but are various
types of arbitrary individuals translated as Skolem
terms. These give the appearance of taking nar-
row scope when they are bound to truly quantified
variables, and of taking wide scope when they are
unbound, and therefore &amp;quot;take scope everywhere.&amp;quot;
Available readings can be computed monotonically
from syntactic derivation alone. The notion of syn-
tactic derivation embodied in CCG is the most pow-
erful limitation on the number of available read-
ings, and allows all logical-form level constraints
on scope orderings to be dispensed with, a result
related to, but more powerful than, that of Pereira
(1990).

It offers a new semantics whereby the effects of quantifier scope alternation can be obtained by an entirely monotonic derivation, without typechanging rules. The paper follows Fodor (1982), Fodor and Sag (1982), and Park (1995, 1996) in viewing many apparent scope ambiguities as arising from referential categories rather than true generalized quantifiers.</abstract>

Recent literature on the semantics of natural quantifiers has departed considerably from the earlier tendency for semanticists to reduce all semantic distinctions of nominal meaning such as de clicto/de re, reference/attribution, etc. to distinctions in scope of traditional quantifiers. There is widespread recognition that many such distinctions arise instead from a rich ontology of different types of (collective, distributive, intensional, groupdenoting, arbitrary, etc.) individual to which nominal expressions refer. (See for example Webber 1978, Barwise and Perry 1980, Fodor and Sag 1982, Fodor 1982, Fine 1985, and papers in the recent collection edited by Szabolcsi 1997.) One example of such non-traditional entity types (if an idea that apparently originates with Aristotle can be called non-traditional) is the notion of &amp;quot;arbitrary objects&amp;quot; (Fine 1985). An arbitrary object is an object with which properties can be associated but whose extensional identity in terms of actual objects is unspecified. In this respect, arbitrary objects resemble the Skolem terms that are generated by inference rules like Existential Elimination in proof theories of first-order </context>

The pronoun looks as though it might be a variable bound by an existential quantifier associated with a donkey. However, no purely combinatoric analysis in terms of the generalized quantifier categories offered earlier allows this, since the existential cannot both remain within the scope of the universal, and come to c-command the pronoun, as is required for true bound pronominal anaphora, as in: (7) Every farmer, in the room thinks that she, deserves a subsidy One popular reaction to this observation has been to try to generalize the notion of</context>

This observation appears to imply that even the relatively free notion of derivation provided by CCG is still too restricted to explain all ambiguities arising from multiple quantifiers. Nevertheless, the idea that semantic quantifier scope is limited by syntactic derivational scope has some very attractive features. For example, it immediately explains why scope alternation is both unbounded and sensitive to island constraints. There is a further property of sentence (5b) which was first observed by Geach (1972), and which makes it seem as though scope phenomena are strongly restricted by surface grammar. While the sentence has one reading where all of the boys and girls have strong feelings toward the same saxophonist—say, John Coltrane—and another reading where their feelings are all directed at possibly different saxophonists, it does not have a reading where the saxophonist has wide scope with respect to every boy, but narrow scope with respect to every girl—that is, where the boys all admire John Coltrane, but the girls all detest possibly different saxophonists.

The fact that relatively few readings are available and that they are so tightly related to surface structure and derivation means that the technique of incremental semantic or probabilistic disambiguation of fully specified partial logical forms mentioned earlier may be a more efficient technique for computing the contextually relevant readings. For example, in processing (22) (adapted from Hobbs and Shieber 1987), which Park 1995 claims to have only four readings, rather than the five predicted by their account, such a system can build both readings for the S 1 NP every representative of three companies saw and decide which is more likely, before building both compatible readings of the whole sentence and similarly resolving with respect to statistical or contextual support: (22) Every representative of three companies saw some sample. 5 Conclusion The above observations imply that only those socalled quantifiers in English which can engender dependency-inducing scope inversion have interpretations co</context>

It follows that the observation of Park (1995, 1996) that only quantified arguments of a single (possibly composed) function can freely alternate scope places an upper bound on the number of readings. The logical form of an n-quantifier sentence is a term with an operator of valency 1, 2 or 3, whose argument(s) must either be quantified expressions or terms with an operator of valency 1, 2 or 3, and so on.

The same applies if quantifiers are generated in situ, then lowered to their surface position.2 Related observations led Partee and Rooth (1983), and others to propose considerably more general use of type-changing operations than are required in CCG, engendering considerably more flexibility in derivation that seems to be required by the purely syntactic phenomena that have motivated CCG up till now.3 While the tactic of including such orderpreserving type-changing operations in the grammar remains a valid alternative for a monotonic treatment of scope alternation in CCG and related forms of categorial grammar, there is no doubt that it complicates the theory considerably.

Two ways to restore monotonicity have been proposed, namely: enriching the notion of derivation via type-changing operations; or enriching the lexicon and the semantic ontology. It is standard in the Frege-Montague tradition to begin by translating expressions like &amp;quot;every boy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;some saxophonist&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;generalized quantifiers&amp;quot; in effect exchanging the roles of arguments like NPs and functors like verbs by a process of &amp;quot;type-raising&amp;quot; the former. In terms of the notation and assumptions of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, Steedman 1996) the standard way to incorporate generalized quantifiers into the semantics of CG deterMiners is to transfer type-raising to the lexicon, assigning the following categories to determiners like every and some, making them functions from nouns to &amp;quot;type-raised&amp;quot; noun-phrases, where the latter are simply the syntactic types corresponding to a generalized quantifier: (3) every := (T I (T\NP)) I N -4 qx every := (T\(TINP))1N :A,p.A,q.Vx.px qx (4) some := (T I (T\NP))1N : XpAq.ax.px A qx some := (TVT I NP))1N :Xp.4.3x.px A qx 301 (T is a variable over categories unique to each individual occurrence of</context>

This is an important saving for the parser, as redundant analyses can be eliminated on the basis of identity of logical forms, a standard method of eliminating such &amp;quot;spurious ambiguities.&amp;quot; Similarly, as well as the restrictions that we have seen introduced by coordination, the SVO grammar of English means (for reasons discussed in Steedman 1996) that embedded subjects in English are correctly predicted neither to extract nor take scope over their matrix subject in examples like the following: (21) a. *a boy who(m) I know that admires John Coltrane b. Somebody knows that every boy admires some saxophonist. As Cooper 1983 points out, the latter has no readings where every boy takes scope over somebody.

Recent literature on the semantics of natural quantifiers has departed considerably from the earlier tendency for semanticists to reduce all semantic distinctions of nominal meaning such as de clicto/de re, reference/attribution, etc. to distinctions in scope of traditional quantifiers. There is widespread recognition that many such distinctions arise instead from a rich ontology of different types of (collective, distributive, intensional, groupdenoting, arbitrary, etc.) individual to which nominal expressions refer. (See for example Webber 1978, Barwise and Perry 1980, Fodor and Sag 1982, Fodor 1982, Fine 1985, and papers in the recent collection edited by Szabolcsi 1997.) One example of such non-traditional entity types (if an idea that apparently originates with Aristotle can be called non-traditional) is the notion of &amp;quot;arbitrary objects&amp;quot; (Fine 1985). An arbitrary object is an object with which properties can be associated but whose extensional identity in terms of actual objects is unspecified. In this respect, arbitrary objects resemble the Skolem terms that are generated by inference rules like Existential Elimination in proof </context>

We will begin by assuming that some is not a quantifier, but rather a determiner of a (singular) arbitrary object. It therefore h</context>
