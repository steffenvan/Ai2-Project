In this work we test the use of word similarity lists
for anaphora resolution in Portuguese corpora. We
applied an automatic lexical acquisition technique
over parsed texts to identify semantically similar
words. After that, we made use of this lexical

In this work we investigate the use of word similar-
ity list for treating coreference, especially the cases
where the coreferent expressions have semantically
related head nouns (instead of same head nouns),
which we call indirect anaphora.
We applied a lexical acquisition technique
(Gasperin, 2001) over Portuguese parsed corpora to
automatically identify semantically similar words.
After that, we made use of this lexical knowledge
to resolve the coreferent definite descriptions where
the head-noun of the anaphor is different from the
head-noun of its antecedent.
Previous work on anaphoric resolution of English
texts has used acquired lexical knowledge in differ-
ent ways, examples are (Poesio et al., 2002; Schulte
im Walde, 1997; Bunescu, 2003).
This paper is organised as follows. The next sec-
tion explain our notion of indirect anaphora. Section
3 details the tools and techniques used to the con-
struction of our lexical resource. Section 4 presents
our heuristic for solving the indirect anaphors on the
basis of such resource. Section 5 details the corpus
we are using for evaluating the proposed heuristics.
Section 6 reports the implementation of the heuris-
tic and in Section 7 we present our experiments
over Portuguese annotated corpora. In Section 8 we
discuss our results and compare them to previous
works. Finally, Section 9 presents our concluding
comments.

2 Indirect anaphora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997936933333334">
Coreference has been defined by (van Deemter and
Kibble, 2000) as the relation holding between lin-
guistic expressions that refer to the same extralin-
guistic entity. A slightly different discourse rela-
tion is anaphora. In an anaphoric relation the in-
terpretation of an expression is dependent on previ-
ous expressions within the same discourse (in vari-
ous ways). Therefore, an anaphoric relation may be
coreferent or not. An expression may be anaphoric
in the strict sense that its interpretation is only possi-
ble on the basis of the antecedent, as it is in general
the case of pronouns in written discourse. On the
other hand, it might be just coreferent, in the sense
that the entity has been mentioned before in the text.
In this work, we focus on the expressions that are
anaphoric and coreferent, and restricting even more,
just the indirect cases, when the antecedent head-
noun and the anaphor head-noun are not same but
semantically related.
To clarify what we mean by indirect anaphora,
we detail the classification we adopted in our pre-
vious work (Vieira et al., 2002; Vieira et al., 2003).
Our classes of analyses were based on the analy-
ses of English texts presented in (Poesio and Vieira,
1998), with the difference that we divided the Bridg-
ing class of their analyses into two different classes,
separating coreferent (Indirect Anaphora) and non-
coreferent (Other Anaphora) cases. Each definite
description (d) is classified into one of the follow-
ing four classes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7593388">
1. Direct anaphora: d corefers with a previous
expression a; d and a have the same nominal
head:
a. A Comissão tem conhecimento do livro... (the
Commission knows the book)
d. a Comissão constata ainda que o livro não se
debruça sobre a actividade das várias... (the Com-
mission remarks that the book ignores the activity
of various)
2. Indirect anaphora: d corefers with a previous
expression a; d and a have different nominal
heads:
a. a circulação dos cidadões que dirigem-se... (the
flow of the citizens heading to...)
d. do controle das pessoas nas fronteiras (the con-
trol of the people in the borders)
3. Other Anaphora: d does not corefer with a pre-
vious expression a, but depends for its interpre-
tation on a:
a. o recrutamento de pessoal científico e técnico...
(the recruitment of scientific and technical em-
ployees)
d. as condições de acesso à carreira científica (the
conditions of employment for scientific jobs)
4. Discourse New: the interpretation of d does not
depend on any previous expression:
d. o livro não se debruça sobre a actividade das
várias organizações internacionais... (the book ig-
nores the activity of various international organ-
isation...)

<bodyText confidence="0.9998065">
In (Schulte im Walde, 1997) acquired lexical
knowledge is used for solving bridging descrip-
tions, a broader class of anaphoric relations that
includes our class, indirect anaphora. (Poesio et
al., 2002) presents alternative techniques, based
on syntactic patterns, focusing on meronymy rela-
tions. Finally, (Bunescu, 2003) deals with another
class of anaphoric descriptions, which is also in-
cluded in the bridging class, called as associative
anaphora, following (Hawkins, 1978), where asso-
ciative anaphora is an anaphoric relation between
non-coreferent entities.

3 Lexical resource
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817814814815">
Our lexical resource consists on lists of semantically
related words. These lists are constructed automati-
cally by a syntax-based knowledge-poor technique.
The technique used is described in (Gasperin et al.,
2001; Gasperin, 2001), and it is an extension of the
technique presented in (Grefenstette, 1994).
Briefly, this technique consists on extracting spe-
cific syntactic contexts for every noun in the parsed
whole corpus and then applying a similarity mea-
sure (the weighted Jaccard measure) to compare the
nouns by the contexts they have in common (more
contexts they share, more similar they are). As syn-
tactic context, we understand any word that estab-
lishes a syntactic relation with a given noun in the
corpus. An example of one kind of syntactic context
considered is subject/verb, meaning that two nouns
that occur as subject of the same verb share this
context. Other examples of syntactic contexts are
verb/object, modifier/noun, etc. To each context it
is assigned a global and a local weight: the first re-
lated to the context frequency in the corpus, and the
second related to its frequency as a context of the
noun in focus. As output, we have a list of the most
similar nouns to each noun in the corpus, ordered
by the similarity value. We present the similarity
list for the noun acusarão (accusation) in Table 1
as an example.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.861243">

<bodyText confidence="0.990473327272728">
The similarity lists can contain any kind of se-
mantic relation (e.g. synonymy, hyponymy, etc.)
between the words, but they are not classified. In
general, the similarity lists for the less frequent
words in the corpus contain some non-semantically
related words (noise), since the relations were based
on few syntactic contexts they shared along the cor-
pus.
The main advantage of this technique is the pos-
sibility of having a corpus-tunned lexical resource
built completely automatically. This resource re-
flects closely the semantic relations present in the
corpus used to create the lists. So, we believe the
similarity lists are more suitable for being used as
lexical knowledge for resolving the anaphoras than
a generic lexical base (e.g. Wordnet), since it focus
on the semantic relations between the terms that ap-
pear in the corpus, without considering extra mean-
ings that some words could have. New lists could be
generated from each corpus that one aims to resolve
the anaphoras.
To generate the similarity lists for Portuguese we
utilised a 1,400,000-words corpus from the Brazil-
ian newspaper ’Folha de São Paulo’, containing
news about different subjects (sports, economics,
computers, culture, etc.). This corpus includes the
acusação
(accusation)
set of texts that was hand-annotated with corefer-
ence information in previous work (Vieira et al.,
2002; Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002). The corpus
was parsed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS
(Bick, 2000), provided by VISL project1.
We created two different sets of similarity lists:
one considering just nouns and the other consider-
ing nouns and proper names. So, the first set of lists
includes one list for each noun in the corpus and
each list is composed by other common nouns. The
second set of lists has one list for each noun and
proper name in the corpus, and each list is com-
posed by other nouns and proper names. The first
set contains 8019 lists and the second 12275, corre-
sponding to the different nouns (and proper names)
appearing in the corpus. Each similarity list con-
tains the 15 words that are more similar to the word
in focus, according to the calculated similarity val-
ues.
Having lexical information about the proper
names in the corpus is important, since we have
many coreference cases whose anaphor or an-
tecedent is a proper name. But when generating the
similarity lists, proper names bring noise (in gen-
eral they are less frequent then common nouns) and
the lists became more heterogeneous (includes more
non semantically related words).

4 Using similar words lists to solve
indirect anaphora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991168">
From the manual annotation and classification of
680 definite descriptions we selected those cases
classified as indirect anaphora (95). For each of
them there is a list of candidate antecedents. This
list is formed by all NPs that occur in the text. We
consider as candidates all the NPs that occur in the
text before the anaphor being mentioned.
Our heuristic for solving indirect anaphoras using
lists of similar words is the following. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998289125">
• Hana is the head-noun of the anaphor
• Hcanz is the head-noun of the antecedent can-
didate i
• Lana is the anaphor’s list of similar nouns
• Lcanz is the list of similar nouns for the candi-
date i
• So, Hcanz is considered the antecedent of Hana
if

<footnote confidence="0.647308">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.855406764705882">
We call (1) ’right direction’, (2) ’opposite direc-
tion’, and (3) ’indirect way’.
We consider (1) &gt; (2) &gt; (3) when regarding the
reliability of the semantic relatedness between Hana
and Hcanz.
If the application of the heuristic resulted in more
than one possible antecedent, we adopted a weight-
ing scheme to choose only one among them. The
candidate with the lowest weight wins. For ranking
the possible antecedents, we considered two param-
eters:
• reliability: how the possible antecedent was se-
lect, according to (1), (2) or (3). A penalis-
ing value is added to its weight: 0, 40, 200,
respectively. The higher penalty for the ’indi-
rect way’ is because we expected it could cause
many false positives;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9709055">
• recency: we consider the distance in words be-
tween the anaphor and the possible antecedent.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981666666667">
The penalty values for the reliability parameter
were chosen in such a way they could be in the same
magnitude as the recency parameter values, that are
measured in words. For example, if candidate A is
250 words far from the anaphor and was selected
by (1) (getting weight=250) and a candidate B is 10
words far from the anaphor and was selected by (3)
(getting weight=210), candidate B will be selected
as the correct antecedent.

5 Our evaluation corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835769230769">
As result of previous work (Vieira et al., 2002;
Vieira et al., 2003), we have a Portuguese corpus
manually annotated with coreference information.
This corpus is considered our gold-standard to eval-
uate the performance of the heuristic presented in
the previous section. The study aimed to verify if
we could get a similar distribution of types of defi-
nite descriptions for Portuguese and English, which
would serve as an indication that the same heuristics
tested for English (Vieira et al., 2000) could apply
for Portuguese. The main annotation task in this
experiment was identifying antecedents and classi-
fying each definite description according to the four
classes presented in section 2.
For the annotation task, we adopted the MMAX
annotation tool (Müller and Strube, 2001), that re-
quires all data to be encoded in XML format. The
corpus is encoded by &lt;word&gt; elements with sequen-
tial identifiers, and the output - the anaphors and
its antecedents - are enconded as &lt;markable&gt; ele-
ments, with the anaphor markable pointing to the
antecedent markable by a ‘pointer’ attribute.
The annotation process was split in 4 steps: se-
lecting coreferent terms; identifying the antecedent
of coreferent terms; classifying coreferent terms (di-
rect or indirect); classifying non-coreferent terms
(discourse new or other anaphora). About half of
the anaphoras were classified as discourse new de-
scriptions, which account for about 70% of non-
coreferent cases. Among the coreferent cases the
number of direct coreference is twice the number of
indirect coreference. This confirms previous work
done for English.
For the present work, we took then the 95 cases
classified as indirect coreference to serve as our
evaluation set. In 14 of this cases, the relation be-
tween anaphor and antecedent is synonymy, in 43
of the cases the relation is hyponymy, and in 38, the
antecedent or the anaphor are a proper name.

6 Implementing heuristics for indirect
anaphora in ART
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987164516129">
Our heuristics were implemented as an XSL
stylesheet on the basis of the Anaphora Resolution
Tool (ART) (Vieira et al., 2003).
The tool integrates a set of heuristics correspond-
ing to one or more stylesheets to resolve different
sorts of anaphora. The heuristics may be applied in
a sequence defined by the user. As resolving direct
anaphoric descriptions (the ones where anaphor and
antecedent have the same head noun) is a much sim-
pler problem with high performance rates as shown
in previous results (Vieira et al., 2000; Bean and
Riloff, 1999), these heuristics should be applied
first in a system that resolves definite descriptions.
In this work, however, we decided to consider for
the experiments just the anaphoras that were pre-
viously annotated as indirect and check if the pro-
posed heuristic is able to find the correct antecedent.
ART allows the user to define the set of anaphors
to be resolved, in our case they are selected from
previously classified definite descriptions. The
stylesheet for indirect anaphora takes as input this
list of indirect anaphors, a list of the candidates and
the similarity lists. We consider all NPs in the text
as candidates, and for each anaphor we consider just
the candidates that appear before it in the text (we
are ignoring cataphora at moment).
All the input and output data is in XML for-
mat, based on the data format used by MMAX.
Our stylesheet for solving indirect anaphora takes
the &lt;markable&gt; elements with empty ‘pointer’ at-
tribute (coming unsolved from passing by the previ-

7 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949764705882">
We run two experiments: one using the similarity
lists with proper names and another with the lists
containing just common nouns.
With these experiments we verify the values for
precision, recall and false positives on the task
of choosing an semantically similar antecedent for
each indirect anaphor. Our annotated corpus has 95
indirect anaphors with nominal antecedents, where
57 of them do not include proper names (as anaphor
or as antecedent). We use a non annotated version of
this corpus for the experiments. It contains around
6000 words, from 24 news texts of 6 different news-
paper sections.
Firstly, we reduced both sets of similarity lists to
contain just the list for the words present in this por-
tion of the corpus (660 lists without proper names
and 742 including proper names).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976955">
7.1 Experiment 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996127291666666">
Considering the 57 indirect anaphoras to be solved
(the ones that do not include any proper name), we
could solve 19 of them. It leads to a precision of
52.7% and a a recall of 33.3%. Table 2 shows the
result of our study considering the set of common
noun lists.
Most of the cases could be resolved by ‘right di-
rection’, that represents the more intuitive way. 21
of the cases didn’t get any antecedent. We got 17
false positives, with different causes:
1. the right antecedent was not in the lists, there-
fore it could not be found but other wrong an-
tecedents were retrieved. For example, in meu
amigo Ives Gandra da Silva Martins escreveu
para esse jornal ... o conselheiro Ives (my
friend Ives_Gandra_da_Silva_Martins wrote
to this newspaper ... the councillor Ives), two
more candidates head-nouns are similar words
to “conselheiro” (councillor): “arquiteto” (ar-
chitect) and “consultor” (consultant), but not
“amigo” (friend);
2. the right antecedent was in the lists but another
wrong antecedent was given higher weights,
because of proximity to the anaphora, as in the
example a rodovia Comandante João Ribeiro
de Barros ... próximo a ponte ... ao ten-
tar atravessar a estrada (the highway Coman-
dante Joao Ribeiro de Barros ... near to the
bridge ... while trying to cross the road). Here,
the correct antecedent to “a estrada” (the road)
is “rodovia” (the highway) and it is present in
“estrada”’s similarity list (right direction), but
also is “ponte” (the bridge) and it is closer to
the anaphor in the text.
As expected, most of the false positives (11 cases)
were ’resolved’ by “indirect way”.
Considering all similar words found among the
candidates, not just the one with highest weight, we
could find the correct antecedent in 24 cases (42%).
The average number of similar words among the
candidates was 2.8, taking into account again the
positive and false positive cases. These numbers
report how much the similarity lists encode the se-
mantic relations present in the corpus. 64% of the
synonymy cases and 28% of the hyponymy cases
could be resolved. 35% of the hyponymy cases re-
sulted in false positives, the same happened with
just 14% of the synonymy cases.

them. It leads to a precision of 36.8% and a a recall
of 22.1%. There was no antecedent found for 38
anaphors, and 36 anaphors got wrong antecedents
(half of them by “inderect way”). We observed the
same causes for false positives as the two presented
for experiment 1.
Considering all cases resolved (correct and false
ones), we could find the correct antecedent among
the similar words of the anaphor in 31 cases
(32.6%). The average number of similar words
among the candidates was 2.75. The numbers for
synonymy and hyponymy cases were the same as
in experiment 1 - 64% and 28% respectively. The
numbers for proper names were 50% of false posi-
tives and 50% of unresolved cases. It means none

Due to the nature of the relations, only some of
them were expected to be found in WordNet. For
Synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy, 39% of the
38 cases could be solved on the basis of WordNet.
From this related work we can see the large variety
of cases one can found in a class such as bridging. In
our work we concentrated on coreference relations,
these can be related to synonymy, hypernymy, and
proper name sub-classes evaluated in (Poesio et al.,
1997).
The technique presented in (Schulte im Walde,
1997) based on lexical acquisition from the British
National Corpus was evaluated against the same
cases in (Poesio et al., 1997). For synonymy, hy-
pernymy and meronymy, it was reported that 22%
of the 38 cases were resolved. In (Poesio et al.,
2002) the inclusion of syntactic patterns improved
the resolution of meronymy in particular, result-
ing in 66% of the meronymy cases being resolved.
Bunescu (Bunescu, 2003) reports for his method on
resolving associative anaphora (anaphoric relation
between non-coreferent entities) a precision of 53%

9 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983384615385">
We tested the use of word similarity lists on re-
solving indirect anaphoras on Portuguese newspa-
per texts. We presented our heuristic for searching
word similarity lists to be able to find the relation
between an anaphor and its antecedent. We con-
sidered similarity lists containing proper names and
lists containing just common nouns. Our heuris-
tic was able to resolve 33.3% of the cases, with
precision of 52.7% when considering just common
nouns, and we got 22.1%recall with precision of
36.8% when including proper names. Even though
considering proper names give us the possibility of
treating more anaphora cases, we got lower preci-
sion than using the lists with only nouns, since such
lists are more homogeneous. These results are com-
parable to previous work dealing with such complex
anaphora.
As future work, we intend to integrate our heuris-
tic for indirect anaphora with other heuristics for
anaphora resolution into ART and investigate the
best combination of application of these. Concern-
ing refining the proposed heuristic, we intend to
run more experiments aiming to tune the penalis-
ing weights when choosing an antecedent among
the candidates already selected by the search on the
similarity lists.

The tool integrates a set of heuristics corresponding to one or more stylesheets to resolve different sorts of anaphora. The heuristics may be applied in a sequence defined by the user. As resolving direct anaphoric descriptions (the ones where anaphor and antecedent have the same head noun) is a much simpler problem with high performance rates as shown in previous results (Vieira et al., 2000; Bean and Riloff, 1999), these heuristics should be applied first in a system that resolves definite descriptions. In this work, however, we decided to consider for the experiments just the anaphoras that were previously annotated as indirect and check if the proposed heuristic is able to find the correct antecedent. ART allows the user to define the set of anaphors to be resolved, in our case they are selected from previously classified definite descriptions. The stylesheet for indirect anaphora takes as input this list of indirect anaphors, a list of the candidates and the similarity lists. We consider all NPs in </context>

New lists could be generated from each corpus that one aims to resolve the anaphoras. To generate the similarity lists for Portuguese we utilised a 1,400,000-words corpus from the Brazilian newspaper ’Folha de São Paulo’, containing news about different subjects (sports, economics, computers, culture, etc.). This corpus includes the acusação (accusation) set of texts that was hand-annotated with coreference information in previous work (Vieira et al., 2002; Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002). The corpus was parsed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000), provided by VISL project1. We created two different sets of similarity lists: one considering just nouns and the other considering nouns and proper names. So, the first set of lists includes one list for each noun in the corpus and each list is composed by other common nouns. The second set of lists has one list for each noun and proper name in the corpus, and each list is composed by other nouns and proper names. The first set contains 8019 lists and the second 12275, corresponding to the different nouns (and proper names) appearing in the corpus. Each similarity list contains the 15 words </context>

For synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy, it was reported that 22% of the 38 cases were resolved. In (Poesio et al., 2002) the inclusion of syntactic patterns improved the resolution of meronymy in particular, resulting in 66% of the meronymy cases being resolved.

The study aimed to verify if we could get a similar distribution of types of definite descriptions for Portuguese and English, which would serve as an indication that the same heuristics tested for English (Vieira et al., 2000) could apply for Portuguese. The main annotation task in this experiment was identifying antecedents and classifying each definite description according to the four classes presented in section 2. For the annotation task, we adopted the MMAX annotation tool (Müller and Strube, 2001), that requires all data to be encoded in XML format. The corpus is encoded by &lt;word&gt; elements with sequential identifiers, and the output - the anaphors and its antecedents - are enconded as &lt;markable&gt; elements, with the anaphor markable pointing to the antecedent markable by a ‘pointer’ attribute. The annotation process was split in 4 steps: selecting coreferent terms; identifying the antecedent of coreferent terms; classifying coreferent terms (direct or indirect); classifying non-coreferent terms (discourse new or other anaphora).

In this work, we focus on the expressions that are anaphoric and coreferent, and restricting even more, just the indirect cases, when the antecedent headnoun and the anaphor head-noun are not same but semantically related. To clarify what we mean by indirect anaphora, we detail the classification we adopted in our previous work (Vieira et al., 2002; Vieira et al., 2003). Our classes of analyses were based on the analyses of English texts presented in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), with the difference that we divided the Bridging class of their analyses into two different classes, separating coreferent (Indirect Anaphora) and noncoreferent (Other Anaphora) cases. Each definite description (d) is classified into one of the following four classes: 1. Direct anaphora: d corefers with a previous expression a; d and a have the same nominal head: a.

The technique presented in (Schulte im Walde, 1997) based on lexical acquisition from the British National Corpus was evaluated against the same cases in (Poesio et al., 1997).

New lists could be generated from each corpus that one aims to resolve the anaphoras. To generate the similarity lists for Portuguese we utilised a 1,400,000-words corpus from the Brazilian newspaper ’Folha de São Paulo’, containing news about different subjects (sports, economics, computers, culture, etc.). This corpus includes the acusação (accusation) set of texts that was hand-annotated with coreference information in previous work (Vieira et al., 2002; Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002). The corpus was parsed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000), provided by VISL project1. We created two different sets of similarity lists: one considering just nouns and the other considering nouns and proper names. So, the first set of lists includes one list for each noun in the corpus and each list is composed by other common nouns. The second set of lists has one list for each noun and proper name in the corpus, and each list is composed by other nouns and proper names. The first set contains 8019 lists and the second 12275, corresponding to the different nouns (and proper names</context>

We applied a lexical acquisition technique (Gasperin, 2001) over Portuguese parsed corpora to automatically identify semantically similar words. After that, we made use of this lexical knowledge to resolve the coreferent definite descriptions where the head-noun of the anaphor is different from the head-noun of its antecedent. Previous work on anaphoric resolution of English texts has used acquired lexical knowledge in different ways, examples are (Poesio et al., 2002; Schulte im Walde, 1997; Bunescu, 2003). This paper is organised as follows. The next section explain our notion of indirect anaphora. Section 3 details the tools and techniques used to the construction of our lexical resource. Section 4 presents our heuristic for solving the indirect anaphors on the basis of such resource. Section 5 details the corpus we are using for evaluating the proposed heuristics.

This confirms previous work done for English. For the present work, we took then the 95 cases classified as indirect coreference to serve as our evaluation set. In 14 of this cases, the relation between anaphor and antecedent is synonymy, in 43 of the cases the relation is hyponymy, and in 38, the antecedent or the anaphor are a proper name. 6 Implementing heuristics for indirect anaphora in ART Our heuristics were implemented as an XSL stylesheet on the basis of the Anaphora Resolution Tool (ART) (Vieira et al., 2003). The tool integrates a set of heuristics corresponding to one or more stylesheets to resolve different sorts of anaphora. The heuristics may be applied in a sequence defined by the user. As resolving direct anaphoric descriptions (the ones where anaphor and antecedent have the same head noun) is a much simpler problem with high performance rates as shown in previous results (Vieira et al., 2000; Bean and Riloff, 1999), these heuristics should be applied first in a system that resolves definite descriptions.
