Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999941764705882">
This paper describes a system for classify-
ing semantic relations among nominals, as
in SemEval task 4. This system uses a
corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with
WordNet senses and covering 139 different
semantic relations. Given a set of nomi-
nal pairs for training, as provided in the Se-
mEval task 4 training data, this system con-
structs for each training pair a set of features
made up of relations and WordNet sense
pairs which occurred with those nominals
in the corpus. A Naive Bayes learning al-
gorithm learns associations between these
features and relation membership categories.
The identification of relations among nomi-
nals in test items takes place on the basis of
these associations.

Using WordNet (Miller, 1995), version 2.0, a cor-
pus of noun-noun compounds was constructed such
that each compound was annotated with the correct
WordNet noun senses for constituent words, the cor-
rect semantic relation between those words, and the
correct WordNet verb sense for that relation, as de-
scribed below.

definition explaining the relation between the words
in that compound (compounds from other sources
would not have such associated definitions). Also,
using compounds from WordNet guarantees that all
constituent words of those compounds would also
have entries in WordNet. An initial list of over
40,000 two-word noun-noun compounds was ex-
tracted from WordNet 2.0. From this list a random
subset was selected. From that set all compounds
using scientific latin (e.g. ocimum basilicum), id-
iomatic compounds (e.g. zero hour), compounds
containing proper nouns (e.g. Yangtze river), non-
english compounds (e.g. faux pas), and chemical
terminology (e.g. carbon dioxide) were excluded.
The remaining compounds were placed in random
order, and a research assistant annotated each with
the WordNet noun senses of the constituent words,
the semantic relation between those words, and the
WordNet verb sense of that relation. A web page
was created for this annotation task, showing the an-
notator the compound to be annotated and the Word-
Net gloss (meaning) for that compound. This page
also showed the annotator the list of WordNet senses
for the modifier noun and head noun in the com-
pound, allowing the annotator to select the correct
sense for each word. After word-sense selection an-
other page was presented allowing the annotator to
identify the correct semantic relation for that com-
pound and to select the correct WordNet sense for
the verb in that relation.

Word sense, relation, and relation sense information
was gathered for 2,500 compounds. Relation occur-
rence was well distributed across these compounds:
there were 139 different relations used in the corpus.
Note that in SemEval task 4, the number of relation
categories available was much smaller than the set
of relation categories available in our corpus (just 7

tween nominals in SemEval task 4.
The approach to compound disambiguation taken
here is similar to that taken by for example Kim &amp;
Baldwin (2005) and Girju, Moldovan, Tatu, &amp; An-
tohe (2005), and works by finding other compounds
containing words from the same semantic categories
as the words in the compound to be disambiguated:
if a particular relation occurs frequently in those
other compounds, that relation is probably also the
correct relation for the compound in question. We
take WordNet senses to represent semantic cate-
gories. Once the correct WordNet sense for a word
has been identified, that word can placed in a set of
nested semantic categories: the category represented
by that sense, by the parent sense (or hypernym) of
that sense, the parent of that parent, and so on up to
the (notional) root sense of WordNet.
Figure 1 shows the algorithm in pseudocode. The
algorithm uses the corpus of annotated noun-noun

compounds and, to disambiguate a compound, takes
as input the correct WordNet sense for the modifier
and head words of that compound (if known) plus
all hypernyms of those senses. If modifier and head
word senses are not known, the most frequent senses
for those words are used, plus all hypernyms of those
senses. The algorithm pairs each modifier sense with
every head sense. For each sense-pair, the algorithm
goes through the corpus of compounds and extracts
every compound whose modifier sense (or a hyper-
nym of that sense) is equal to the modifier sense in
the current sense-pair, and whose head sense (or a
hypernym of that sense) is equal to the head sense in
that pair. The algorithm counts the number of times
each relation occurs in that set of compounds, and
assigns each relation a Proportional Relation Occur-
rence (PRO) score for that pair, equal to the condi-
tional probability of relation R given sense-pair S.
If the PRO score for relation R in the current
sense-pair is greater than the score obtained for R
with some other pair, the current score is recorded
for R. If the score for R for the current pair P is
greater than any previous score obtained for P, that
score is recorded for P. In this way the algorithm
finds the maximum score for each relation R across
all sense-pairs, and the maximum score for each pair
P across all relations. The algorithm returns a list of
relations and of sense-pairs for the compound, both
sorted by score. The relations and sense-pairs with
the highest scores are those most likely to be correct
for that compound and to be most important for its
relational meaning.
In Costello, Veale and Dunne (2006), this algo-
rithm was tested by applying it to the annotated cor-
pus using a leave-one-out approach. These tests
showed a reliable relationship between PRO score
and accuracy of response. At a PRO level of 1, the
algorithm return a response (selects a relation) for
just over 900 compounds, and approximately 850 of
those responses are correct (the algorithm’s preci-
sion at this level is 0.92).

4 Adapting to the SemEval 4 task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840769230769">
To apply the PRO algorithm to the training and test
sentences in SemEval task 4 first required a mapping
from the labels used to tag nominals in that task (la-
bels e1 and e2) to the modifier and head categories
used by the PRO algorithm. To carry out this map-
ping the nominal whose label appeared in the first
position in a relation tag was taken to be the modi-
fier for that relation, and that in the second position
was taken to be the head; for example, with the rela-
tion tag CONTAINER-CONTENT(E1,E2) the nomi-
nal e1 would be taken to be the modifer and e2 to
be the head. Given this mapping the PRO algorithm
could be applied to sentences from SemEval task 4,
taking modifier and head nominals as input and pro-
ducing as output lists of candidate relations and rel-
evant sense pairs (sorted by PRO score).
The relations produced by the PRO algorithm do
not correspond to the 7 relations in SemEval task
4. To make predictions about the 7 SemEval rela-
tions, the scored relation lists and sense-pair lists
returned by the PRO algorithm were used as fea-
tures for a straightforward Naive Bayes learning al-
gorithm, as implemented in the Perl module Algo-
rithm::NaiveBayes. For each sentence in a training
set in SemEval task 4, the PRO algorithm was ap-
plied to produce a list of relations and sense pairs
describing that sentence. Each relation and each
sense pair in this list has an associated PRO score,
and Naive Bayes was trained on these features of all
members of the training set, and then applied to test
set sentences to produce predictions about each sen-
tence’s membership or non-membership in the rela-
tion in question.
Version A of the system used neither the WordNet
sense tags nor the Query labels provided with the 7
relation categories used. Instead of using WordNet
senses for the input words the system simply used
the first (most frequent) noun senses for those words,
and proceeded as described above. Version B used
WordNet sense tags. Versions C and D of the system
used either the first WordNet sense or the provided
sense tags, coupled with the query terms used in the
SemEval task. An additional module in the system
was intended to make use of these query terms in
relation classification by comparing the query term
of the sentence to be classified with query terms in
positive or negative training examples of that rela-
tion, and making a decision based on that compari-
son. Unfortunately, due to an error this query term
module was not activated in the submitted runs, so
the results from versions C and D are the same as
from A and B.

Table 1 shows the results returned for the PRO sys-
tem for training run 4 (using all 140 training items in
each relation) for the four possible runs A, B, C and
D. Due to the error in activating the query term mod-
ule, columns C4 and D4 are identical to columns A4
and B4. There are two notable aspects of the results
in Table 1. First, the system’s performance was bet-
ter for run A4 (that did not use WordNet senses) than
for B4 (using WordNet senses). Indeed, the system
came first out of 6 systems which took part in the
A4 run. This was surprising: it had been expected
that using the correct WordNet senses for nominals
would improve the system’s performance. Analy-
sis revealed that A4 runs using most frequent Word-
Net senses provided more matches with entries in
the compound corpus the B4 run using the correct
WordNet senses. This may explain why the system
gave a better performance for A4 than B4.
The second interesting aspect of Table 1 is the
variation of the system’s responses across the dif-
ferent relation categories. For the two relations
‘Origin-Entity’ and ‘Theme-Tool’ the system has an
F-score of 50 or less, while for the other five rela-
tions the system’s F-score is around 70. It is not as
yet clear why the system performed so poorly for
these relations: further investigation is needed to ex-
plain this curious pattern.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971363636364">
This paper has described a system for automatically
seslecting relations between nominals which uses
the PRO algorithm and compound corpus to form
features for pairs of nominals (consisting of can-
didate relations and sense-pairs co-occurring with
those relations), and uses a Naive Bayes algorithm
to learn to identify relations between nominals from
those features. The system performs best using the
most frequent WordNet senses for those nominals,
suggesting that the system may work usefully in de-
ducing semantic relations between nominals with-
out the need to deduce word senses. However, the
system’s performance does not seem particularly
impressive or suitable for application to real-world
tasks as yet. The system’s best performance repre-
sents an accuracy of 66% across relations: in other
words, the system gets 1 in three relations wrong in
the SemEval task.
There is one very obvious area for improvement in
the system described here. Currently the system uses
a simple Naive Bayes algorithm for learning associ-
ations between features and relation categories. A
more sophisticated approach (using Support Vector
Machines, for example) would be likely to improve
the systsem’s performance noticably. The conver-
sion of the system to use some form of SVM should
not be difficult. A more difficult problem, however,
is to address the system’s poor performance on some
relations. This is currently difficult to understand,
and represents a serious flaw in the system. Resolv-
ing this problem may reveal some useful aspects of
the structure of different sorts of semantic relations
between nominals.

Four different versions of the adapted system were produced (versions A,B, C and D), either using or not using the WordNet labels and the Query labels provided with training and test items in SemEval task 4. Section 5 discusses the performance of these different versions of the system. Finally, Section 6 finishes the paper with some discussion and ideas for future work. 2 A Corpus of Annotated Compounds Using WordNet (Miller, 1995), version 2.0, a corpus of noun-noun compounds was constructed such that each compound was annotated with the correct WordNet noun senses for constituent words, the correct semantic relation between those words, and the correct WordNet verb sense for that relation, as described below. 2.1 Corpus Procedure The compounds used in this corpus were selected from the set of noun-noun compounds defined in WordNet. Compounds from WordNet were used because each compound had an associated gloss or 1A file containing this corpus is available for download from http://inismor.ucd.ie/∼fintanc/wordnet compou</context>
