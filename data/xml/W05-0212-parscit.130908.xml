Native speakers of English who are good
readers can “sound out” words or names
from printed text, even if they have never
seen them before, although they may not
be conscious of the strategies they use.
No tools are available today that can con-
vey that knowledge to learners, showing
them the rules that apply in English text.
We have adapted the letter-to-phoneme
component of a text-to-speech synthesizer
to a web-based software system that can
teach word decoding to non-native speak-
ers of English, English-speaking children,
and adult learners.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999935703703704">
Learning to read a language like English involves
learning many different operations, including pho-
nemic awareness, word recognition, fluency, ver-
bal comprehension, and expression. The research
in this project focuses on the pronunciation aspect
of reading from the printed page: understanding
how letters, or graphemes, in words are related to
sounds, or phonemes.
Most people recognize that the relationship be-
tween English orthography and phonetic represen-
tation is complex and somewhat arbitrary.
Although there is significant evidence that phono-
logical information plays an important role in word
reading (Kayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, and
Seidenberg, 2001), the precise role of “phonics
rules” that would allow a learner to “sound out” a
printed word has been debated by educators as well
as by cognitive psychologists, and many versions
of phonics rules have been discussed by educators.
A classic paper by Clymer (1963) argued that
most of the phonics generalizations taught in ele-
mentary school are not valid most of the time.
Clymer found that for many of the rules, there
were so many exceptions that the rule had little
utility as a generalization for teaching learners to
sound out a word of English. However, the
Clymer results do not necessarily mean that phonic
generalizations are not useful to readers. Since
Clymer, there have been many papers that have
suggested alternate formulations of the letter-to-
phoneme rules for teaching reading. For example,
a recent study by Johnston (2001) found one rea-
son that Clymer considered phonics rules to be
unreliable is because the rules he evaluated were
too general. Today, there is no consensus on a set
of rules, nor does there exist any complete, explicit
rule system that “decodes” any word or proper
name of English for learners.
E-Speech’s letter-to-phoneme (LTP) software,
developed over many years for text-to-speech and
speech recognition applications, uses proprietary
rules to produce pronunciations for any input text.
We have adapted the LTP software into a proto-
type web-based, interactive online system that tea-
ches word pronunciation by explicitly presenting
rules for those words/names pronounced according
to regular rules and by showing exceptions to the
rules. The system allows students to view families
of words that obey any given rule and to view
words with the same letter patterns that obey diffe-
rent rules.
Our intent is to develop a system that can pro-
vide phonics training for beginning readers, either
children or adults who are native speakers of En-

glish, as well as for nonnative speakers of English
and language-disabled learners. We envision the
system either as part of an interactive dictionary or
general language-teaching package or stand-alone
as an instructional tool for teaching word pronun-
ciation.
A major challenge is to identify rules that are
useful for learners and to present them effectively.
We have begun to test our prototype system with
nonnative speakers of English who were studying
English as a second or foreign language. Our pre-
liminary results indicate that the software was (1)
useful in improving nonnative speakers’ pronun-
ciation of English words; (2) effective at teaching
both “basic” pronunciation rules, such as those
commonly taught in phonics programs, and some
novel, proprietary pronunciation rules.

The Word Pronunciation tool allows a student to
enter any word or name – whether it is in any dic-
tionary or not - and see our set of rules that account
for its pronunciation. The screen capture below
shows the output for the word “photograph”. The
student can also hear the word pronounced, either
normally or syllable-by-syllable.1

1 The system uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to repre-
sent phonetic transcriptions, because most of our target population,
adult foreign-born learners of English as a second language, were
familiar with this alphabet, since it is used in many English learners’
dictionaries.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997083">
In addition, a student can click on any rule and see
other words obeying the same rule as well as
words that are exceptions to the rule.2
The Letter Pattern tool allows a student to enter
a letter or sequence of letters (ie, a letter pattern)
and see the rules that apply to that pattern and ex-
ceptions to those rules. For example, a student
confused by the fact that &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot; don&apos;t
rhyme can enter the letter pattern &amp;quot;ow&amp;quot; and view
the various generalizations (rules) that determine
the pronunciation of this letter string in different
contexts, as well as words that don&apos;t follow these
generalizations (exceptions). The software under-
lying this tool allows the user to tailor the output to
his needs of the moment. For example, one can
choose 1-syllable versus multisyllabic words as
targets for the rules, how many sample words to
output by default, and how big a vocabulary from
which to draw words. A simple example of the
operation of this tool is illustrated in Figure 2.

While we developed the Letter Pattern tool for ge-
neral use by learners, we used its underlying search
engine in exercises designed to diagnose and teach
pronunciation rules.
We implemented a framework for a self-paced
set of exercises that allows the user to work alone
to diagnose his pronunciation-rule weaknesses and
learn the rules necessary to correct his errors. We
used this framework to assess the effectiveness of
our rules and system for learners.
In the typical exercise interaction, the user sees
a sequence of words and must choose the correct
pronunciation for each. He indicates his choice of

is, rules for pronouncing phonemes. Although our letter-to-phoneme
software assigns lexical stress (to indicate which syllable bears pri-
mary stress in polysyllabic words), the stress assignment algorithm is
quite complicated. Although the algorithm is accurate, it is too com-
plicated for a human to apply for learning. We also ignored the rules
for morphological decomposition, such as for analyzing “walking’
into “walk” plus “ing” or “snowman” into “snow” plus “man”.

pronunciation by clicking on one of several op-
tions, represented in the International Phonetic Al-
phabet (IPA) or by clicking on a speaker-symbol,
so that he can hear the options spoken. An example
of a test item would be the nonsense word “doke”.
If the user chooses an incorrect pronunciation for
this word, he is told the correct pronunciation, as
well as the relevant rule, which in this case is that
an &apos;o&apos; followed by a single consonant followed by a
final &apos;e&apos; is pronounced /oʊ/. The user can choose
to see actual examples of the rule in action
(“smoke”, “home”, etc.) and other rules involving
&apos;o&apos; (eg., the default pronunciation /ɑ:/, as in “hot”).
In some cases, the exercises tested real English
words, and in others, “nonsense” words (words
that do not exist in English but are possible as
words, because they have letter sequences occur-
ring in English words). Only through knowing the
general rules of English pronunciation can a stu-
dent correctly predict the pronunciation of words
he has never seen before. Figure 3 shows the exer-
cise for knowledge of the letter “a” in the nonsense
word “jate.&amp;quot;

This “lesson” screen highlights the relevant pro-
nunciation rule in the word. Because subjects told
us that our pronunciation rule syntax, derived from
our LTP rules, was “too mathematical” and hard to
understand, the screen also displays an English
language explanation for each rule (e.g., “In the
letter pattern a – any letter – e, the letter a is pro-
nounced as /eɪ/”). In our prototype, we developed
a simple text-generation algorithm to translate
from our “mathematical” rule syntax (“a → /eɪ/, in
a.e”) into normal English for the rules that we tes-
ted in our evaluation. Going forward, however, we
will need to produce the explanations via a more
sophisticated algorithm or simply hand-prepare
explanations for the rules.
A subject can click on the “See all words” link
to see more English words in which that rule ap-
plies. After the “lesson” the learner is given the
opportunity to try again, in order to reinforce the
correct pronunciation.
The design of the prototype incorporates several
features that are important to its extension to a full
learning system. First, the set of exercises is table-
driven, so that is relatively easy to add a new set of
exercises. This feature is important since a com-
plete system will need a large number of exercises.
Second, the system is designed so that the corpus
of words that serve as examples of the rules can be
changed easily. This feature is important since
different user groups (e.g., adult nonnative spea-
kers, children, speakers with reading disabilities)
may require different kinds of words as examples.

3 Experimental Results

<bodyText confidence="0.9407029375">
In addition to developing lexical resource tools, we
conducted an experiment to determine (1) if our
software could be useful in teaching nonnative
speakers of English how to pronounce English
words, and if so, (2) if both commonly-taught pro-
nunciation rules and pronunciation rules that are
idiosyncratic to the E-Speech letter-to-phoneme
system can effectively be taught.
We considered testing the lexical resource tools
directly by giving students lists of words and in-
structing them to use the tools to learn the pronun-
ciation rules for the words. However, we felt that a
more efficient way of testing our software would
be to develop a set of exercises to diagnose and
teach various pronunciation rules and then to test
how effectively students learned from the exer-
cises. We developed the design of the exercises

We sought to improve nonnative speakers’ word
pronunciation competence, aiming toward giving
them the competence of native speakers of English.
Therefore, we included both native and nonnative
speakers as subjects. 10 nonnative speakers of
English and 7 native speakers of English success-
fully completed the final set of exercises. Six
non-native subjects were undergraduates or gradu-
ate students at Montclair State University who had
been assigned to an English as a Second Language
course based on their performance on an English
language test administered by the university. The
other four were nonnative speakers of English in
Brazil, Bolivia, and Germany. Native languages of
the subjects were German, Portuguese, Korean,
Spanish, Polish, Bangla (Bangladesh), and Urhobo
(Nigeria). The native English-speaking subjects
were high school or college students who grew up
in New Jersey.3
The subjects were assigned logins to the system
and were instructed to complete a series of exer-
cises, each of which would present different Eng-
lish pronunciation rules. A subject logged in to the
system with a web-browser over the internet, saw a
printed word and a set of possible pronunciations
for the word (as described above). The student was
instructed to listen to the set of choices and to
choose the pronunciation that he thought was cor-
rect. Subjects were told that each exercise would
consist of two parts. The first part of each exercise
would identify the pronunciation rules with which
a subject might need help and then teach the rule;
the second part of the exercise would determine
whether teaching the pronunciation rules was ef-
fective. In the teaching part of the exercise, each
rule was presented several times, as it applied to
different words. Subjects were allowed to repeat
the first part of each exercise as many times as they
wished, until they felt comfortable about proceed-
ing to the test part of the exercise.
3 Nonnative subjects were told that we had developed software for teaching
word pronunciation and we needed nonnative speakers to try the software and
see if it helped them to improve their word pronunciation. English-speaking
subjects were told that we had developed software for teaching word pronuncia-
tion to nonnative subjects, and that we needed to compare the students’ per-
formance with native speakers’ performance.
Our software logged the students’ choice for
each word in each part of each exercise and scored
it as correct (1) or incorrect (0). We computed the
percentage of correct choices, which we call the
word pronunciation score. We also logged the
number of times a student practiced with the diag-
nosis/lesson portion of each exercise, and the
amount of time a student spent with each item.
The basic exercises were:
Basic: 1-syllable nonsense words representing
“basic” rules, rules that are extremely common in
English words. These are productive rules (English
speakers apply them in nonsense words), and rules
capturing these generalizations are commonly
taught in phonics programs. Specifically the exer-

letter - e , as in make
• a is pronounced /æ/ by default, as in cat and analo-
gous rules for the letters e, i, o, u.

The other exercises taught and tested rules from
the LTP system, using English words rather than
nonsense words as the material. These were:
LTP1: the basic rules for the letter a, plus the
trisyllabic laxing rule (which we call the 3-syllable
rule), which causes underlying long vowels and
diphthongs to shorten to a lax vowel in antepenul-

timate syllables:
• a is pronounced /ei/, in a - any letter - e, as in make
• a is pronounced /æ/ in a – any letter - e when a is 3
syllables from the end of a word (the “3-syllable
rule”), as in tragedy
• a is pronounced /æ/,by default, as in cat
LTP2: rules for a before the letter l:
• a is pronounced /:):/ in all at the end of the word, as
in ball
• a is pronounced /:):/, in alt, as in salt
• a is pronounced /ei/, in a - any letter - e, as in sale

• a is pronounced /æ/ by default, as in pal and cat

by the letter r:
• a is pronounced /:):/ in war
• a is pronounced /aB/ in arr followed by any vowel ,
as in carry
• a is pronounced /a:/ in ar at the end of the word, as
in car, and in ar followed by any consonant, as in
part

dents could integrate all the rules.

We chose this particular set of LTP rules be-
cause they would allow us to compare the “basic”
rules, common to many phonics programs, and
rules in our LTP system that are not taught in
phonics programs. All the non-basic rules in our
experiment were pronunciation rules for the letter
“a” and were chosen because they applied to many
English words and represented a variety of formal
types of rules. For example, some had relatively
simple contexts (e.g., “alt”), and some had compli-
cated contexts. For most of the rules, the context
was specified in terms of the surrounding letters
(for example, the letter a when followed by any
letter and the letter e). For one rule, the context
was specified in terms of the surrounding pho-
nemes. This latter type of rule is complicated be-
cause it requires that a learner first identify the
phonemes for the letters surrounding the target let-
ter “a”.
In the exercise on “basic rules”, we used non-
sense words to teach and test pronunciation rules.
Our reasoning was that the strongest test of
whether a student knows the rules is to test his
pronunciation of nonsense words, since the only
way he could possibly know how to pronounce a
nonsense word is by applying the rules. Further,
we felt there was strong evidence that the “basic
rules” are productive in English. That is, native
speakers of English know these rules and apply
them in novel words and nonsense words. For ex-
ample, English speakers pronounce the “a” in non-
sense words with “a” – consonant – “e” at the end
of a word, (e.g., “pake”, “glape”, “nade”) as /ei/.
Consequently, we felt that teaching and testing
with nonsense words would help give nonnative
speakers the same competence as native speakers.
However, for the other exercises we used real
English words. Our reasoning was that the non-
basic rules, although they apply to classes of Eng-
lish words, may not be productive in English. That
is, native speakers of English might not apply the
rules to nonsense words, even though the rule gov-
erns a class of existing English words. For exam-
ple, in English, “oo” is most commonly /u:/ (as in
“coo” and “cool”), but when the “oo” is followed
by a final “k”, the vowel is almost always pro-
nounced /u/ (e.g., “took”, “book”, “cook”,
“brook”, “crook”, “snook”, though there are a few
exceptions: “kook”, “spook”). The question thus
arises whether native speakers of English, who
obviously know how to pronounce these words,
have internalized the “ook rule” and apply it in
novel words. Native speakers do not always pro-
nounce novel “ook” words with /u/; instead, they
sometimes use /u:/ in nonsense words, like
“mook”, “dook”, “vook” (see Treiman et. al.,
2003). Of course, the fact that a rule is not produc-
tive does not mean that it is not useful for teaching
students how to pronounce words; clearly it would
be useful for students to know that “ook” is usually
pronounced /uk/. However, since we wanted to
compare nonnatives’ performance to natives’ per-
formance, and we were primarily concerned with
teaching nonnative speakers how to pronounce real
English words, we chose to teach and test real, as
opposed to nonsense, words.4
We did include one test of non-basic-rules that
used nonsense words, anticipating that native
speakers might perform differently from nonna-
tives, if the nonnatives, who had been explicitly
taught pronunciation rules, applied them to non-
sense words, even if natives did not apply them
productively in nonsense words.

native speakers had higher word pronunciation

across subjects, for the different exercises, which
represented different sets of pronunciation rules.
We wanted to know whether some exercises
proved more learnable than others. In general, as
shown at the right side of the Figure 7, for nonna-
tive speakers, for each exercise, the word pronun-
ciation scores were higher after the lessons than
before, although the effects were greater for some
exercises than others. For native speakers, in con-
trast, there were no systematic differences in the
before versus after scores. However, overall,
scores were higher for some exercises than for
other exercises even for native speakers. Examina-
tion of the native speakers’ “incorrect” responses
suggests that dialectal issues may have caused
some native speakers to choose responses that we
did not anticipate. For example, for the word
“waffle”, some native subjects chose the pronun-
ciation /wɔ:fəl/, although we had assumed that the
pronunciation in these subjects’ dialect was
/wɑ:fəl/.
Figures 8 and 9 suggest that some rules were
useful to nonnative subjects. For example, the &amp;quot;ba-
sic&amp;quot; rules, in general, were effective; the nonsense
words tested after the lessons elicited higher scores
than those tested before any lessons. Of the other,
letter-to-phoneme-based rules, the &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; rule and
the 3-syllable rule seemed to be effective (the “be-
fore” bar for “war” is not displayed in Figure 9,
because the before score was extremely low, only
20%).

A complicated rule, the /w/a rule (i.e., the rule that
the letter &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; after the phoneme /w/ is pronounced
/ɑ:/), appeared not to be useful to nonnative sub-
jects. We found no evidence for the effect of teach-
ing for another rule, the “aste” rule, because all
nonnative subjects knew the pronunciation of the
“aste” words before the lessons. However, there
were differences between subjects. One source of
this difference is probably due to differences in the
nonnative subjects’ pre-existing English knowl-
edge; that is some subjects knew some word pro-
nunciations in advance of the lessons.
Consequently, for some rules we obtained data for
only a few subjects.
As discussed above, since the items in the exer-
cises testing our letter-to-phoneme rules were Eng-
lish words (even though there were not common
words) how do we know that subjects’ perform-
ance was due to our lessons; perhaps the subjects
simply knew the words’ pronunciation before par-
ticipating in our experiments? How well do nonna-
tive speakers apply the rules they learned to words
that we can be sure they have never seen before?
One of our exercises, LTP-all included a section
that contained only nonsense words (e.g., “later-
ous”, “plar”, “swarg”, “falt”).
Figure 10. Word Pronunciation Scores for non-
words versus words in the Integrated Rules Test
LTP-all after lessons
Figure 10 presents the results of the nonsense
word portion of LTP-all: pronunciation scores for
real English words versus nonsense words for non-
native subjects and the analogous scores for native
speakers, collapsed across subjects. Although
there were between-subject differences, on aver-
age, both sets of subjects had lower scores for non-
sense words than for words. If subjects based their
scores for all test items – words as well as non-
sense words – entirely on the word pronunciation
rules that we included in our exercises, then we
would expect their scores to be the same for words
and nonsense words. Since words have an empiri-
cally correct pronunciation (they are given in a
dictionary, for example), native speakers may be
relying on a stored phonological representation for
the word items. For nonsense words, however, the
subjects must rely on rules or other principles. If
subjects used rules or principles for pronouncing
nonsense words different from the ones we ex-
pected, then the nonsense word scores would be
lower than those for words. However, the pronun-
ciation scores for the nonsense words for the non-
native subjects were higher than that for natives.
This fact suggests that the nonnatives were, in fact,
applying the pronunciation rules they had learned
in our lessons to the nonwords.

In summary, our preliminary results indicate
that: (1) our software was useful in teaching non-
native speakers of English how to pronounce Eng-
lish words; (2) both “basic” pronunciation rules
and some novel, proprietary pronunciation rules
were useful for teaching word pronunciation.

4 Future Research

<bodyText confidence="0.999980368421053">
The major directions for our future research are to
select and reformulate LTP rules that are useful for
teaching and then to obtain more user data for
nonnative speakers and for native-English-
speaking children learning to read.
First, we intend to produce a complete learner’s
rule system for English, based on the entire set of
text-to-speech LTP rules. Since our text-to-speech
system contains roughly 800 LTP rules, which we
believe is too large a number for learners, a signifi-
cant task is to reduce the number of rules. We
intend to focus on rules that apply to large numbers
of words and remove rules that apply to few words,
relegating the words to which they apply to the
exceptions dictionary. We also intend to attempt
to collapse rules that apply in similar contexts.
Second, we need to determine whether learners
can, in general, understand a pronunciation system
that requires rule ordering. In our system, some
rules are labeled as “default” rules, meaning that
they apply if no other rules apply. Consequently,
learners must know all the rules in order to know
when to apply the default rule. If the number of
rules is too large, learners may need a system in
which each rule is independently unambiguous.
Third, we need to recruit more nonnative speak-
ers of English who are good candidates for improv-
ing their word pronunciation skills. Some of our
subjects in this experiment had relatively high
word pronunciation scores before exposure to our
lessons, so that observing any effect of our lessons
was inherently limited. Therefore, we would like
to recruit more subjects with lower word pronun-
ciation ability, in order to get a better picture of the
effectiveness of our system. Can we predict which
students will have high pronunciation scores and
which will have low scores based on a student’s
report of his or her experience in English

Figure 11 presents the average word pronuncia-
tion scores for each subject at the beginning of the
exercises, before doing lessons. As shown, the
reported length of time a student had studied Eng-
lish was not correlated with word pronunciation
scores. Consequently, we cannot depend on a stu-
dent’s reported length of time studying English as
predictive of his word pronunciation abilities. In-
stead, we will need to screen prospective subjects
via pretesting.
Finally, although we have developed our system
for nonnative speakers, we would like to test our
system with native-English-speaking children
learning to read. However, it is likely that the user
interface and corpus of exemplar words will need
to be different for the child population.

Most people recognize that the relationship between English orthography and phonetic representation is complex and somewhat arbitrary. Although there is significant evidence that phonological information plays an important role in word reading (Kayner, Foorman, Perfetti, Pesetsky, and Seidenberg, 2001), the precise role of “phonics rules” that would allow a learner to “sound out” a printed word has been debated by educators as well as by cognitive psychologists, and many versions of phonics rules have been discussed by educators. A classic paper by Clymer (1963) argued that most of the phonics generalizations taught in elementary school are not valid most of the time. Clymer found that for many of the rules, there were so many exceptions that the rule had little utility as a generalization for teaching learners to sound out a word of English. However, the Clymer results do not necessarily mean that phonic generalizations are not useful to readers. Since Clymer, there have been many papers that have suggested alternate formulations of the letter-tophoneme rules for teaching reading.
