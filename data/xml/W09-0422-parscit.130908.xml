We describe two systems for English-to-
Czech machine translation that took part
in the WMT09 translation task. One of
the systems is a tuned phrase-based system
and the other one is based on a linguisti-
cally motivated analysis-transfer-synthesis
approach.

We participated in WMT09 with two very dif-
ferent systems: (1) a phrase-based MT based
on Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and tuned for
English→Czech translation, and (2) a complex
system in the TectoMT platform (ˇZabokrtsk´y et
al., 2008).

As the source of parallel data we use an internal
release of Czech-English parallel corpus CzEng
(Bojar et al., 2008) extended with some additional
texts. One of the added sections was gathered
from two major websites containing Czech sub-
titles to movies and TV series1. The matching of
the Czech and English movies is rather straight-
forward thanks to the naming conventions. How-
ever, we were unable to reliably determine the se-
ries number and the episode number from the file
names. We employed a two-step procedure to au-
tomatically pair the TV series subtitle files. For
every TV series:

1. We clustered the files on both sides to remove
duplicates
2. We found the best matching using a provi-
sional translation dictionary. This proved to
be a successful technique on a small sample
of manually paired test data. The process was
facilitated by the fact that the correct pairs of
episodes usually share some named entities
which the human translator chose to keep in
the original English form.

2.3 Data Preprocessing using TectoMT
platform: Analysis and Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815739130435">
As we believe that various kinds of linguistically
relevant information might be helpful in MT, we
performed automatic analysis of the data. The
data were analyzed using the layered annotation
scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0
(PDT 2.0, Hajiˇc and others (2006)), i.e. we used
three layers of sentence representation: morpho-
logical layer, surface-syntax layer (called analyti-
cal (a-) layer), and deep-syntax layer (called tec-
togrammatical (t-) layer).
The analysis was implemented using TectoMT,
(ˇZabokrtsk´y et al., 2008). TectoMT is a highly
modular software framework aimed at creating
MT systems (focused, but by far not limited to
translation using tectogrammatical transfer) and
other NLP applications. Numerous existing NLP
tools such as taggers, parsers, and named entity
recognizers are already integrated in TectoMT, es-
pecially for (but again, not limited to) English and
Czech.
During the analysis of the large Czech mono-
lingual data, we used Jan Hajiˇc’s Czech tagger
shipped with PDT 2.0, Maximum Spanning Tree
parser (McDonald et al., 2005) with optimized set
of features as described in Nov´ak and ˇZabokrtsk´y
(2007), and a tool for assigning functors (seman-
tic roles) from Klimeˇs (2006), and numerous other
components of our own (e.g. for conversion of an-
alytical trees into tectogrammatical ones).
In the parallel data, we analyzed the Czech side
using more or less the same scenario as used for
the monolingual data. English sentences were an-
alyzed using (among other tools) Morce tagger
Spoustov´a et al. (2007) and Maximum Spanning
Tree parser.2
The resulting deep syntactic (tectogrammatical)
Czech and English trees are then aligned using T-
aligner—a feature based greedy algorithm imple-
mented for this purpose (Mareˇcek et al., 2008). T-
aligner finds corresponding nodes between the two
given trees and links them. For deciding whether
to link two nodes or not, T-aligner makes use of
a bilingual lexicon of tectogrammatical lemmas,
morphosyntactic similarities between the two can-
didate nodes, their positions in the trees and other
similarities between their parent/child nodes. It

(2008)), we used phrase-structure parser Collins (1999) with
subsequent constituency-dependency conversion.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998819">
also uses word alignment generated from surface
shapes of sentences by GIZA++ tool, Och and Ney
(2003). We use acquired aligned tectogrammatical
trees for training some models for the transfer.
As analysis of such amounts of data is obvi-
ously computationally very demanding, we run it
in parallel using Sun Grid Engine3 cluster of 40
4-CPU computers. For this purpose, we imple-
mented a rather generic tool that submits any Tec-
toMT pipeline to the cluster.

3 Factored Phrase-Based MT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858676470588">
We essentially repeat our experiments from last
year (Bojar and Hajiˇc, 2008): GIZA++ align-
ments4 on a-layer lemmas (a-layer nodes corre-
spond 1-1 to surface tokens), symmetrized using
grow-diag-final (no -and) heuristic5.
Probably due to the domain difference (the test
set is news), including Subtitles in the parallel data
and Web in the monolingual data did not bring any
improvement that would justify the additional per-
formance costs. For most of the phrase-based ex-
periments, we thus used only 2.2M parallel sen-
tences (27M Czech and 32M English tokens) and
43M Czech sentences (694 M tokens).
In Table 3 below, we report the scores for the
following setups selected from about 50 experi-
ments we ran in total:
Moses T is a simple phrase-based translation (T)
with no additional factors. The translation is
performed on truecased word forms (i.e. sen-
tence capitalization removed unless the first
word seems to be a name). The 4-gram lan-
guage model is based on the 43M sentences.
Moses T+C is a factored setup with form-to-form
translation (T) and target-side morphological
coherence check following Bojar and Hajiˇc
(2008). The setup uses two language mod-
els: 4-grams of word forms and 7-grams of
morphological tags.
Moses T+C+C&amp;T+T+G 84k is a setup desirable
from the linguistic point of view. Two in-
dependent translation paths are used: (1)
form→form translation with two target-side
checks (lemma and tag generated from the
target-side form) as a fine-grained baseline

<footnote confidence="0.9977125">

4Default settings, IBM models and iterations: 153343.
5Later, we found out that the grow-diag-final-and heuris-
tic provides insignificantly superior results.

with the option to resort to (2) an independent
translation of lemma→lemma and tag→tag
finished by a generation step that combines
target-side lemma and tag to produce the fi-
nal target-side form.
We use three language models in this setup
(3-grams of forms, 3-grams of lemmas, and
10-grams of tags).
Due to the increased complexity of the setup,
we were able to train this model on 84k par-
allel sentences only (the Commentaries sec-
tion) and we use the target-side of this small
training data for language models, too.
For all the setups we perform standard MERT
training on the provided development set.6

4 Translation Setup Based on
Tectogrammatical Transfer
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999477">
In this translation experiment, we follow the tradi-
tional analysis-transfer-synthesis approach, using
the set of PDT 2.0 layers: we analyze the input
English sentence up to the tectogrammatical layer
(through the morphological and analytical ones),
then perform the tectogrammatical transfer, and
then synthesize the target Czech sentence from its
tectogrammatical representation. The whole pro-
cedure consists of about 80 steps, so the following
description is necessarily very high level.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989781">
4.1 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977">
Each sentence is tokenized (roughly according to
the Penn Treebank conventions), tagged by the En-
glish version of the Morce tagger Spoustoviet al.
(2007), and lemmatized by our lemmatizer. Then
the dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005) is
applied. Then the analytical trees resulting from
the parser are converted to the tectogrammatical
ones (i.e. functional words are removed, only
morphologically indispensable categories are left
with the nodes using a sequence of heuristic proce-
dures). Unlike in PDT 2.0, the information about
the original syntactic form is stored with each t-
node (values such as v:inf for an infinitive verb
form, v:since+fin for the head of a subor-
dinate clause of a certain type, adj:attr for
an adjective in attribute position, n:for+X for a
given prepositional group are distinguished).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.582861333333333">
6We used the full development set of 2k sentences for
“Moses T” and a subset of 1k sentences for the other two
setups due to time constraints.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998367">
One of the steps in the analysis of English is
named entity recognition using Stanford Named
Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). The nodes
in the English t-layer are grouped according to the
detected named entities and they are assigned the
type of entity (location, person, or organization).
This information is preserved in the transfer of the
deep English trees to the deep Czech trees to al-
low for the appropriate capitalization of the Czech
translation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.885783">
4.2 Transfer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998049">
The transfer phase consists of the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999666714285714">
• Initiate the target-side (Czech) t-trees sim-
ply by “cloning” the source-side (English) t-
trees. Subsequent steps usually iterate over
all t-nodes. In the following, we denote a
source-side t-node as S and the correspond-
ing target-side node as T.
• Translate formemes using
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977075">
two probabilistic dictionaries
(p(T.formeme|S.formeme, S.parent.lemma)
and p(T.formeme|S.formeme)) and a few
manual rules. The formeme translation
probability estimates were extracted from a
part of the parallel data mentioned above.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987818444444444">
• Translate lemmas using a probabilistic dictio-
nary (p(T.lemma|S.lemma)) and a few rules
that ensure compatibility with the previously
chosen formeme. Again, this probabilistic
dictionary was obtained using the aligned
tectogrammatical trees from the parallel cor-
pus.
• Fill the grammatemes (deep-syntactic equiv-
alent of morphological categories) gender
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8042159">
(for denotative nouns) and aspect (for verbs)
according to the chosen lemma. We also
fix grammateme values where the English-
Czech grammateme correspondence is non-
trivial (e.g. if an English gerund expression is
translated to Czech as a subordinating clause,
the tense grammateme has to be filled). How-
ever, the transfer of grammatemes is defi-
nitely much easier task than the transfer of
formemes and lemmas.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.838154">
4.4 Preliminary Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999739175">
According to our observations most errors happen
during the transfer of lemmas and formemes.
Usually, there are acceptable translations of
lemma and formeme in respective n-best lists
but we fail to choose the best one. The sce-
nario described in Section 4.2 uses quite a
primitive transfer algorithm where formemes
and lemmas are translated separately in two
steps. We hope that big improvements could
be achieved with more sophisticated algo-
rithms (optimizing the probability of the whole
tree) and smoothed probabilistic models (such
as p(T.lemma|S.lemma, T.parent.lemma) and
p(T.formeme|S.formeme, T.lemma, T.parent.lemma)).
Other common errors include:
we derive surface morphological categories
from their deep counterparts taking care of their
agreement where appropriate and we also remove
personal pronouns in subject positions (because
Czech is a pro-drop language).
To arrive at the surface tree structure, auxil-
iary nodes of several types are added, including
(1) reflexive particles, (2) prepositions, (3) subor-
dinating conjunctions, (4) modal verbs, (5) ver-
bal auxiliaries, and (6) punctuation nodes. Also,
grammar-based node ordering changes (imple-
mented by rules) are performed: e.g. if an English
possessive attribute is translated using Czech gen-
itive, it is shifted into post-modification position.
After finishing the inflection of nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs (according to the values of
morphological categories derived from agreement
etc.), prepositions may need to be vocalized: the
vowel -e or -u is attached to the preposition if the
pronunciation of prepositional group would be dif-
ficult otherwise.
After the capitalization of the beginning of each
sentence (and each named entity instance), we ob-
tain the final translation by flattening the surface
tree.

<listItem confidence="0.99993225">
• Analysis: parsing (especially coordinations
are problematic with McDonald’s parser).
• Transfer: the translation of idioms and col-
locations, including named entities. In these
cases, the classical transfer at the t-layer
is not appropriate and utilization of some
phrase-based MT would help.
• Synthesis: reflexive particles, word order.

Unfortunately, this preliminary evaluation sug-
gests that simpler models perform better, partly
because it is easier to tune them properly both
from computational point of view (e.g. MERT
not stable and prone to overfitting with more fea-
tures7), as well as from software engineering point
of view (debugging of complex pipelines of tools
is demanding). Moreover, simpler models run
faster: “Moses T” with 12 sents/minute is 4.6
times faster than “Moses T+C”. (Note that we have
not tuned either of the models for speed.)
While “Moses T” is probably nearly identical
setup as Google and Univ. of Edinburgh use,
the knowledge of correct language-dependent to-
kenization and the use of relatively high quality
large language model data seems to bring moder-
ate improvements.

Taligner finds corresponding nodes between the two given trees and links them. For deciding whether to link two nodes or not, T-aligner makes use of a bilingual lexicon of tectogrammatical lemmas, morphosyntactic similarities between the two candidate nodes, their positions in the trees and other similarities between their parent/child nodes.

Unlike in PDT 2.0, the information about the original syntactic form is stored with each tnode (values such as v:inf for an infinitive verb form, v:since+fin for the head of a subordinate clause of a certain type, adj:attr for an adjective in attribute position, n:for+X for a given prepositional group are distinguished). 6We used the full development set of 2k sentences for “Moses T” and a subset of 1k sentences for the other two setups due to time constraints. One of the steps in the analysis of English is named entity recognition using Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). The nodes in the English t-layer are grouped according to the detected named entities and they are assigned the type of entity (location, person, or organization). This information is preserved in the transfer of the deep English trees to the deep Czech trees to allow for the appropriate capitalization of the Czech translation. 4.2 Transfer The transfer phase consists of the following steps: • Initiate the target-side (Czech) t-trees simply by “cloning” the source-side (English) ttrees. Subsequent steps usually iterate over all t-nodes. In the following, we denote a source-side t-node as S a</context>
