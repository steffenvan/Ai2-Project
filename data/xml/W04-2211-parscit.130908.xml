<bodyText confidence="0.992588458333333">
This paper addresses a new method of
constructing Korean-Chinese verb
patterns from existing patterns. A verb
pattern is a subcategorization frame of
a predicate extended by translation
information. Korean-Chinese verb
patterns are invaluable linguistic
resources that only used for
Korean-Chinese transfer but also for
Korean parsing. Usually a verb pattern
has been either hand-coded by expert
lexicographers or extracted auto-
matically from bilingual corpus. In the
first case, the dependence on the
linguistic intuition of lexicographers
may lead to the incompleteness and the
inconsistency of a dictionary. In the
second case, extracted patterns can be
domain-dependent. In this paper, we
present a method to construct Korean-
Chinese verb patterns semi-
automatically from existing Korean-
Chinese verb patterns that are manually
written by lexicographers.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999203714285715">
PBMT (Pattern-based Machine Translation)
approach has been adopted by many MT
researchers, mainly due to the portability,
customizability and the scalability of the
approach. cf. Hong et al. (2003a), Takeda (1996),
Watanabe &amp; Takeda (1998). However, major
drawback of the approach is that it is often very
costly and time-consuming to construct a large
amount of data enough to assure the
performance of the PBMT system. From this
reason many studies from PBMT research
circles have been focused on the data acquisition
issue. Most of the data acquisition studies were
about automatic acquisition of lexical resources
from bilingual corpus.
Since 2001, ETRI has developed a Korean-
Chinese MT system, TELLUS K-C, under the
auspices of the MIC (Ministry of Information
and Communication) of Korean government.
We have adopted verb pattern based approach
for Korean-Chinese MT. The verb patterns play
the most crucial role not only in the transfer but
also in the source language analysis. In the
beginning phase of the development, most of the
verb patterns were constructed manually by
experienced Korean-Chinese lexicographers
with some help of editing tools and electronic
dictionaries. In the setup stage of a system, the
electronic dictionary is very useful for building a
verb pattern DB. It provides with a
comprehensive list of entries along with some
basic examples to be added to the DB. In most
cases, however, the examples in the dictionary
with which the lexicographers write a verb
pattern are basic usages of the verb in question,
and other various usages of the verb are often
neglected. Bilingual corpus can be useful
resources to extract verb patterns. However, as
for language pairs like Korean-Chinese for
which there are not so much bilingual corpus
available in electronic form, the approach does
not seem to be suitable. Another serious
problem with the bilingual corpus-based
approach is that the patterns extracted from the
corpus can be domain-dependent.
The verb pattern generation based on
translation equivalency is another good
alternative to data acquisition from bilingual
corpus. The idea was originally introduced by
Fujita &amp; Bond (2002) for Japanese to English
MT.
In this paper, we present a method to
construct Korean-Chinese verb patterns from
existing Korean-Chinese verb patterns that are
manually written by lexicographers. The clue for
the semi-automatic generation is provided by the
idea that verbs of similar meanings often share
the argument structure as already shown in
Levin (1993). The synonymy among Korean
verbs can be indirectly inferred from the fact
that they have the same Chinese translation.
We have already applied the approach to
TELLUS K-C and increased the number of verb
patterns from about 110,000 to 350,000. Though
350,000 patterns still contain many erroneous
patterns, the evaluations in section 5 will show
that the accuracy of the semi-automatically
generated patterns is noteworthy and the pattern
matching ratio improves significantly with
350,000 pattern DB.

When constructing verb pattern dictionary, too
much dependence on the linguistic intuition of
lexicographers can lead to the inconsistency and
the incompleteness of the pattern dictionary.
Similar problems are encountered when working
with a paper dictionary due to the insufficient
examples. Hong et al (2002) introduced the
concept of causative/passive linking to Korean
word dictionary. The active form ‘mekta (to
eat)’ is linked to its causative/passive forms
‘mekita (to let eat)’, and ‘mekhita (to be eaten)’,
respectively. The linking information of this sort
helps lexicographers not to forget to construct
verb patterns for causative/passive verbs when
they write a verb pattern for active verbs. The
semi-automatic generation of verb patterns using
translation equivalency was tried in Hong et al
(2002). However, as only the voice information
was used as a filter, the over-generation problem
is serious.
Fujita &amp; Bond (2002) and Bond &amp; Fujita
(2003) introduced the new method of
constructing a new valency entry from existing
entries for Japanese-English MT. Their method
creates valency patterns for words in the word
dictionary whose English translations can be
found in the valency dictionary. The created
valency patterns are paraphrased using
monolingual corpus. The human translators
check the grammaticality of the paraphrases.
Yang et al. (2002) used passive/causative
alternation relation for semi-automatic verb
pattern generation. Similar works have been
done for Japanese by Baldwin &amp; Tanaka (2000)
and Baldwin &amp; Bond (2002) .

3 Verb Pattern in TELLUS K-C
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906909090909">
The term ‘verb pattern’ is understood as a kind
of subcategorization frame of a predicate.
However, a verb pattern in our approach is
slightly different from a subcategorization frame
in the traditional linguistics. The main difference
between the verb pattern and the subcategoriza-
tion frame is that a verb pattern is always linked
to the target language word (the predicate of the
target language). Therefore, a verb pattern is
employed not only in the analysis but also in the
transfer phase so that the accurate analysis can
directly lead to the natural and correct genera-
tion. In the theoretical linguistics, a subcatego-
rization frame always contains arguments of a
predicate. An adjunct of a predicate or a
modifier of an argument is usually not included
in it. However, in some cases, these words must
be taken into account for the proper translation.
In translations adjuncts of a verb or modifiers of
an argument can seriously affect the selection of
target words. (1) exemplifies verb patterns of
“cata (to sleep)”:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.464678">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.551973">
1 The slot for nominal arguments is separated by a symbol
“!” from case markers like “ka”, “lul”, “eykey”, and etc.
The verb is also separated by the symbol into the root and
the ending.

On the left hand of “&gt;” Korean subcate-
gorization frame is represented. The argument
position is filled with a variable (A, B, or C)
equated with a semantic feature (WEATHER,
HUMAN, WATCH, PHENOMENA). Currently
we employ about 410 semantic features for
nominal semantic classifications. The Korean
parts of verb patterns are employed for syntactic
parsing.
On the right hand of “&gt;” Chinese translation
is given with a marker “:v”. To every pattern is
attached an example sentence for better
comprehensibility of the pattern. This part
serves for the transfer and the generation of
Chinese sentence.

4 Pattern Construction based on
Chinese Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999526791666667">
In this chapter, we elaborate on the method of
semi-automatic construction of Korean-Chinese
verb patterns. Our method is similar to that of
Fujita &amp; Bond (2002) and inspired by it as well,
i.e. it makes most use of the existing resources.
The existing resources are in this case verb
patterns that have already been built manually.
As every Korean verb pattern is provided with
the corresponding Chinese translation, Korean
verb patterns can be re-sorted to Chinese
translations. The basic assumption of this
approach is that the verbs with similar meanings
tend to have similar case frames, as is pointed
out in Levin (1993). As an indication to the
similarity of meaning among Korean verbs,
Chinese translation can be employed. If two
verbs share Chinese translation, they are likely
to have similar meanings. The patterns that have
translation equivalents are seed patterns for
automatic pattern generation.
Our semi-automatic verb pattern generation
method consists of the following four steps:
Step1: Re-sort the existing Korean-Chinese verb
patterns according to Chinese verbs
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.987862066666667">
Example:
Chinese Verb 1: ift (to give)
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka
B=HUMAN!eykey
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul
swuyeha!ta
Chinese Verb 2: (to stop)
kumantwuta A=HUMAN!ka
B=CONSTRUCTION!lul
kumantwu!ta
kwantwuta A=ORGANIZATION!ka
B=VIOLATION!lul
kumantwu!ta
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.94458025">
When the re-sorting is done, we have sets of
synonymous Korean verbs which share Chinese
translations, such as {tulita, cwuta, swuyehata}
and {kumantwuta, kwantwuta }.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.805642055555556">
Step2: Pair verbs with the same Chinese
translation
Example:
Chinese Verb 1: ift (to give)
Pair1:
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka
B=HUMAN!eykey
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta
Pair2:
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul
swuyeha!ta
Pair3:
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka
B=HUMAN!eykey
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.86102">
swuyeha!ta
Step3: Exchange the verbs, if the following
three conditions are met:
- The two Korean verbs of the pair have
the same voice information
- Neither of the two verbs is idiomatic
expressions
- The Chinese translation is not ࡴҹ,
䖯㸠, خ� ԰
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.915805666666667">
Example:
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=HUMAN!eykey
C=VEGETABLE!lul tuli!ta
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul
tuli!ta
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul cwu!ta
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul
cwu!ta
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul
swuyeha!ta
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=HUMAN!eykey
C=VEGETABLE!lul swuyeha!ta
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.942456">
Step4: If the newly-generated pattern already
exists in the verb pattern dictionary, it is
discarded.
The three conditions to be met in the third
step are the filters to prevent the over-generation
of patterns. The following examples shows why
the first condition, i.e., “the voice of the verbs in
question must agree”, must be met.
ttiwuta : A=HUMAN!ka B=PLACE!ey
C=PLANT!lul ttiwu!ta &gt; A C :v B
[ai(A)ka mwulwi(B)ey namwutip(C)ul ttiwuta:
A baby floated a leaf on the water]
sayongtoyta : A=HUMAN!eyuyhay
B=MEDICINE!ka sayongtoy!ta
Ⓓ⫼ [hankwuksalamtul(A)eyuyhay yak(B)i
hambwulo sayongtoyta: The drug is misused by
Koreans]
sayonghata : A=HUMAN!ka B=MEDICINE!lul
sayongha!ta Ⓓ⫼ [hankwuksalamtul
(A)un yak(B)ul hambwulo sayonghanta:
Koreans are misusing the drug]
As we re-sort the existing patterns according
to the Chinese verbs which are marked with “:v”,
the verbs of different voice may be gathered
together. However, as the above examples show,
the voice (active vs. causative in (2), passive vs.
active in (3)) affects the argument structure of
verbs. We conclude that generating patterns
without considering the voice information can
lead to the over-generation of patterns. The
voice information of verbs can be obtained from
the linking information between the verb pattern
dictionary and the word dictionary. We will not
look into the details of the linking relation
between the verb pattern dictionary and the
word dictionary of TELLUS K-C system in this
paper. cf. Hong et al. (2002)
The second condition relates to the lexical
patterns of Korean. Lexical patterns are used for
collocational expressions. As the nature of
collocation implies, a predicate that shows a
strict co-occurrence relation with a certain
nominal argument cannot be arbitrarily com-
bined with any other nouns.
The third condition deals with the support
verb construction of Chinese. The four verbs, ࡴ
ҹ, 䖯㸠, خ� ԰, belong to the major verbs
in Chinese that form support verb construction
with predicative nouns. In support verb
construction, the argument structure of the
sentence is not determined by a verb but by a
predicative noun. Because of this, the same
Chinese translation cannot be the indication of
similar meaning of Korean verbs, as followed:

Although the Korean verbs “ttallangkelita (to
ring)”, “ssawuta (to fight)”, “wuntonghata (to
exercise)” share the Chinese verb “ ”, the
argument structure of each Chinese translation is
determined by the predicative nouns that are
syntactically objects of the verbs.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991631578947">
The 114,581 verb patterns we have constructed
for 3 years were used as seed patterns for semi
automatic generation of patterns. After the steps
1 and 2 of the generation process were finished,
the sets of possible synonymous verbs were
constructed. To filter out the wrong synonym
sets, the whole sets were examined by two
lexicographers. It took a week for two
lexicographers to complete this process. The
wrong synonym sets were produced mainly due
to the homonymy of Chinese verbs.
From the original 114,581 patterns, we
generated 235,975 patterns. We performed two
evaluations with the generated patterns. In the
first evaluation, we were interested in finding
out how many correct patterns were generated.
The second evaluation dealt with the improve-
ment of the pattern matching ratio due to the
increased number of patterns.

In the first evaluation we randomly selected
3,086 patterns that were generated from 30
Chinese verbs. The expert Korean-Chinese
lexicographers examined the generated patterns.
Among the 3,086 patterns, 2,180 were correct.
The accuracy of the semi-automatic generation
was 70.65%. Although the evaluation set was
relatively small in size, the accuracy rate seemed
to be quite promising, considering there still
remain other filtering factors that can be taken
into account additionally.

<bodyText confidence="0.999634476190476">
Korean-Chinese verb patterns are invaluable
linguistic resources that cannot only be used for
Korean-Chinese transfer but also for Korean
analysis. In the set-up stage of the development,
a paper dictionary can be used for exhaustive
listing of entry words and the basic usages of the
words. However, as the verb patterns made from
the examples of a dictionary are often in-
sufficient, a PBMT system suffers from the
coverage problem of the verb pattern dictionary.
Considering there are not so many Korean-
Chinese bilingual corpus available in electronic
form till now, we believe the translation-based
approach, i.e. Chinese-based pattern generation
approach provides us with a good alternative.
The focus of our future research will be
given on the pre-filtering options to prevent
over-generation more effectively. Another issue
will be about post-filtering technique using
monolingual corpus with minimized human
intervention.

Bilingual corpus can be useful resources to extract verb patterns. However, as for language pairs like Korean-Chinese for which there are not so much bilingual corpus available in electronic form, the approach does not seem to be suitable. Another serious problem with the bilingual corpus-based approach is that the patterns extracted from the corpus can be domain-dependent. The verb pattern generation based on translation equivalency is another good alternative to data acquisition from bilingual corpus. The idea was originally introduced by Fujita &amp; Bond (2002) for Japanese to English MT. In this paper, we present a method to construct Korean-Chinese verb patterns from existing Korean-Chinese verb patterns that are manually written by lexicographers. The clue for the semi-automatic generation is provided by the idea that verbs of similar meanings often share the argument structure as already shown in Levin (1993). The synonymy among Korean verbs can be indirectly inferred from the fact that they have the same Chinese translation. We have already applied the approach to TELLUS K-C and increased the number of verb patterns from about 110,000 to 350,00</context>

Currently we employ about 410 semantic features for nominal semantic classifications. The Korean parts of verb patterns are employed for syntactic parsing. On the right hand of “&gt;” Chinese translation is given with a marker “:v”. To every pattern is attached an example sentence for better comprehensibility of the pattern. This part serves for the transfer and the generation of Chinese sentence. 4 Pattern Construction based on Chinese Translation In this chapter, we elaborate on the method of semi-automatic construction of Korean-Chinese verb patterns. Our method is similar to that of Fujita &amp; Bond (2002) and inspired by it as well, i.e. it makes most use of the existing resources. The existing resources are in this case verb patterns that have already been built manually. As every Korean verb pattern is provided with the corresponding Chinese translation, Korean verb patterns can be re-sorted to Chinese translations. The basic assumption of this approach is that the verbs with similar meanings tend to have similar case frames, as is pointed out in Levin (1993).

Though 350,000 patterns still contain many erroneous patterns, the evaluations in section 5 will show that the accuracy of the semi-automatically generated patterns is noteworthy and the pattern matching ratio improves significantly with 350,000 pattern DB. 2 Related Works When constructing verb pattern dictionary, too much dependence on the linguistic intuition of lexicographers can lead to the inconsistency and the incompleteness of the pattern dictionary. Similar problems are encountered when working with a paper dictionary due to the insufficient examples. Hong et al (2002) introduced the concept of causative/passive linking to Korean word dictionary. The active form ‘mekta (to eat)’ is linked to its causative/passive forms ‘mekita (to let eat)’, and ‘mekhita (to be eaten)’, respectively.

However, as the above examples show, the voice (active vs. causative in (2), passive vs. active in (3)) affects the argument structure of verbs. We conclude that generating patterns without considering the voice information can lead to the over-generation of patterns. The voice information of verbs can be obtained from the linking information between the verb pattern dictionary and the word dictionary. We will not look into the details of the linking relation between the verb pattern dictionary and the word dictionary of TELLUS K-C system in this paper. cf. Hong et al. (2002) The second condition relates to the lexical patterns of Korean. Lexical patterns are used for collocational expressions. As the nature of collocation implies, a predicate that shows a strict co-occurrence relation with a certain nominal argument cannot be arbitrarily combined with any other nouns. The third condition deals with the support verb construction of Chinese. The four verbs,  ҹ, 䖯㸠, خ� , belong to the major verbs in Chinese that form support verb construction with predicative nouns. In support verb construction, the argument structure of the sentence is not determined by a verb bu</context>

In this paper, we present a method to construct KoreanChinese verb patterns semiautomatically from existing KoreanChinese verb patterns that are manually written by lexicographers. 1 Introduction PBMT (Pattern-based Machine Translation) approach has been adopted by many MT researchers, mainly due to the portability, customizability and the scalability of the approach. cf. Hong et al. (2003a), Takeda (1996), Watanabe &amp; Takeda (1998). However, major drawback of the approach is that it is often very costly and time-consuming to construct a large amount of data enough to assure the performance of the PBMT system. From this reason many studies from PBMT research circles have been focused on the data acquisition issue.
