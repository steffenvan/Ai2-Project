Our society was founded on 13 June 1962 as
the Association for Machine Translation and
Computational Linguistics. Consequently, this
1982 Annual Meeting represents our 20th
anniversary. We did, of course, change our name
to the Association for Computational Linguistics
in 1968, but that did not affect the continuity of
the organization. The date of this panel, 17
June, misses the real anniversary by four days,
but no matter; the occasion still allows us to
reflect on where we have been and where we are
going. I seem to be sensitive to opportunities
for celebrations. In looking through my AMTCL/ACL
correspondence over the years, I came across a
copy of a memo sent to Bob Simmons and Hood
Roberts during our 10th anniversary year,
recommending that something in commemoration might
be appropriate. I cannot identify anything in the
program of that meeting or in my notes about it
that suggests they took me seriously then, but
that reflects the critical difference between
volunteering a recommendation and just plain
volunteering!
My invitation to participate in this panel
was sent out to the presidents of the Association,
who were, in order, Vic Yngve, Dave Hays, Win
Lehmann, Paul Garvin, Susumo Kuno, (I fit here in
the sequence), Martin Kay, Warren Plath, Joyce
Friedman, Bob Simmons, Bob Barnes, Bill Woods,
Aravind Joshi, Stan Petrick, Paul Chapin, Jon
Allen, Ron Kaplan, Bonnie Webber, Norm Sondheimer,
and Jane Robinson, and to my predecessor as
Secretary-Treasurer, Hood Roberts. Harry
Josselson, our first Secretary-Treasurer, is no
longer among us, but he would have enjoyed such a
gathering, being one for ceremony and celebration.
Vic, Dave, Martin, Warren, Joyce, Bob
Simmons, Bill, Aravind, Stan, Paul, Jon, Ron,
Bonnie, and Norm agreed to join me on the panel.
Jane refused on the grounds that she was not yet
part of history and that her Presidential Address
provided ample platform to convey her reflections.
Win, Paul, Susumo, and Bob Barnes were not able to
come, and Hood was still waffling when this piece
was being written. Vic, Dave, Win, Bob Simmons,
Aravind, Paul, Jon, Norm, and I have written down
some of our reflections; they appear on the
following pages.
My charge to the panelists, with respect to
both oral and written tradition, was quite broad:
-You are asked to reflect on significant
experiences during your tenure of that office, in
particular as they reflect on the state of
computational linguistics then and now, and
perhaps with some suggestions for what the future
will bring.&amp;quot; The written responses are varied, as
you can see; I am sure that the oral responses
will prove to be equally so.
To provide some perspective--and record some
history, I am attaching a synopsis of &amp;quot;officers,
editors, committees, meetings, and program
chairing&amp;quot; (please let me know about errors!). It
is interesting to note the names of people--many
of whom are still prominent in the field, the
practices associated with our annual meetings, and
our publication history. I will comment on the
latter two.
Our first meeting was held in conjunction
with the 1963 ACM National Conference, but it is
clear that our primary allegiance has been with
the Linguistic Society of America, since we met
seven times in conjunction with its summer
meetings. For a period, we alternated between the
LSA and the Spring Joint Computer Conference--and
actually included that schedule in our membership
flyer. We joined with the American Society for
Information Science twice, and the Cognitive
Science Society once. The convocation of the
first International Conference on Computational
Linguistics, now known popularly as COLING,
replaced our annual meeting in 1965, and we are
scheduled to host COLING-84 in two years.
Recently, we have been meeting independently,
reflecting an increased confidence in our ability
to &amp;quot;make it on our own!&amp;quot;
The publication history of the Association
has been equally varied. The Finite String, our
newsletter, was published as a separate under the
editorship of Hood Roberts from 1964 through 1973,
and has continued in various forms ever since. In
1965, the Association adopted MT: Mechanical
Translation, a journal founded by Vic Yngve in
1954, changing its name to Mechanical Translation
and Computational Linguistics in the process.
However, that journal was not able to sustain a
sufficient flow of manuscripts, and the last
issue, dated 1968, was published in 1970. After a
lengthy exploration of an alternative primary
journal, Dave Hays brought the American Journal of
Computational Linguistics into being in 1974. His
intention had been to create a printed journal
that contained extended abstracts, supplemented by
microfiches that provided details, programs, and
computer listings. This proposal was submitted to
the National Science Foundation for support. A
grant was approved, but it stipulated that we
publish a microfiche-only journal, and we did that
until 1978, The Finite String being issued as a
separate microfiche during this period. It became
increasingly clear during the five microfiche
years that the micropublishing industry was not
going to develop as predicted in the early 1970s.

Microfiche readers that were both inexpensive and President 1967 1968
convenient had not materialized, and our members
Kuno Walker
were reluctant to commit their manuscripts to a Vice-President Walker Mersel
medium that restricted readership to a dedicated Sec-Treasurer Josselson Josselson
few. Consequently, George Heidorn set about Executive Satterthwait Satterthwait
converting the AJCL to a printed journal, the Committee Hockett Fromkin
first issue of which appeared in 1980. Respectful Members Pendergraft Pendergraft
of its microformal origins, it is distributed with Editor (FS) Roberts Roberts
a microfiche that duplicates the printed version Editor (MTCL) Yngve Yngve
but sometimes contains additional material. The Assoc Editor Chapin
Finite String Newsletter continues to provide Nominating Garvin Garvin
general information of interest to the membership Committee Hays Kuno
as a special section. Members Lieberman Lieberman

To complete our publication history, I can 4/21 (SJCC) 7/24-25 (LSA)
announce a new venture that the Association is Program Chair Walker Petrick
just beginning, Studies in Natural Language
Processing, a monograph series under the 1969 1970
Editorship of Aravind Joshi. It was prompted by President Kay Plath
Norm Sondheimer and brought into being through the Vice-President Plath Friedman
organizational efforts of Paul Chapin. We are Sec-Treasurer Josselson Josselson
just completing negotiations with Cambridge Executive Satterthwait Wall
