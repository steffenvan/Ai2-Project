<bodyText confidence="0.999991769230769">
This paper describes a proposal for
Portuguese possessive pronominal anaphor
(PPA) resolution, a problem little considered
so far. Particularly, we address the problem
of Portuguese 3rd person intrasentential
PPAs seu/sua/seus/suas (his/her/their/its, for
human and non-human subjects in English),
which constitute 30% of pronominal
occurrences in our corpus (Brazilian laws
about environment protection). Considering
some differences between PPAs and other
kinds of anaphors, such as personal or
demonstrative pronouns, we define three
knowledge sources (KSs) for PPA resolution:
surface patterns (taking in account factors
such as syntactic parallelism), possessive
relationship rules and sentence centering.
These knowledge sources are organized in a
blackboard architecture for PPA resolution,
which provides both knowledge and
procedure distribution among autonomous
entities (reflexive agents), each of them
specialized in a particular aspect of the
problem solving. The proposal has been
implemented and its results are discussed at
the end of the work.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940115384615">
Most work on anaphor resolution
apply syntactic constraints (c-command,
gender and number agreement, etc) to select
the appropriate anaphoric referent. However,
these constraints are not suitable for
possessive pronominal anaphor (PPA)
resolution in Portuguese, which requires a
more specific approach.
This paper describes a resolution
strategy for a problem little considered so far,
PPAs &amp;quot;seu/sua/seus/suas&amp;quot; (his/her/their/its,
for human and non-human subjects in
English), which constitute 30% of
pronominal occurrences in our corpus
(Brazilian laws about environment
protection).
The paper is structured as follows.
We present some characteristics of
Portuguese PPAs (section 2). We then
describe some factors in PPA resolution and
the way these factors can determine PPAs
antecedents (section 3). Factors are
implemented as knowledge sources in a
blackboard architecture (section 4), and
finally we present the results of our
implementation (section 5).

2. The PPA resolution problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997667625">
From the interpretation point of view,
PPAs are widely different from other kinds of
anaphors, such as personal or demonstrative
pronouns. In this section we present some
specific characteristics of Portuguese PPAs
&amp;quot;seu/sua/seus/suas&amp;quot;, by means of generic
examples in natural language. Some of these
examples, however, may be inappropriate in

<bodyText confidence="0.989569352941177">
English version, when using pronouns
&amp;quot;his/her/ their/its&amp;quot;.
First, we notice the lack of gender or
number agreement between PPAs and their
antecedents. The English version of example
1 has a trivial solution, based on syntactic
constraints, but the Portuguese version is
ambiguous:
Ex 1: Joao falou a Maria sobre seu cachorro.
(John told Mary about his dog).
Example 2 shows that PPAs can
occur in several grammatical (usually, non-
subject) positions. Besides, in example 3, we
notice that PPAs can refer to different
segments of a &amp;quot;NP-of-NP-of-NP...&amp;quot; chain.
This kind of structure, with several NPs in
the same chain, is typical in our domain.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.430470714285714">
Ex 2: Joao viu um cachorro trazendo seu jornal I seu
filhote. (John saw a dog bringing his newspaper I its
puppy).
Ex 3: 0 pai do garotinho vendeu sua casa. (The father
of the little boy sold his house).
0 dono do cao vendeu seu carro I seu filhote. (The
owner of the dog sold his car I its puppy).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884045454546">
In some situations, PPAs like shown
in example 2 and 3 can be solved by applying
semantic knowledge, since PPAs establish
possessive relationships (in concrete or
figurative sense) between objects in
discourse. For example, a human being can
usually possess &amp;quot;his car&amp;quot;, but a dog cannot.
However, we have found in our corpus
several PPAs, namely abstract anaphors,
which cannot be particularly related to any
semantic object. For example, we have PPAs
such as &amp;quot;their importance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;their relevance&amp;quot;,
etc. Similarly, we have found also some
abstract antecedents, such as &amp;quot;the problem&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;the importance&amp;quot;, etc.
Finally, we notice that, in our corpus,
we have to treat long and complex sentence
structures, which are typical in the domain
(laws) that we are dealing with. Thus, despite
PPAs in our corpus are mostly (99%)
intrasentential, there is a high number of
candidates for each anaphor.

3. Factors in PPA resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901269230769">
This section describes a minimal set
of factors in PPA resolution, based on corpus
investigation. These factors will be
considered in place of traditional syntactic
constraints, which are not suitable for our
present problem, as shown in section 2. In
our proposal, because of the structural
complexity of sentences in the domain, we
have adopted a practical approach, based on
simple heuristic rules, with a view to
avoiding syntactic and semantic analysis.
Similar strategies have been adopted in
several recent works in anaphor resolution,
such as T. Nasukawa (1994), R. Mitkov
(1996), R. Vieira &amp; M. Poesio (1997) and
others.
We have defined 6 simple factors in
PPA resolution (F1 to F6) based on syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic knowledge, aiming
to determine PPAs antecedents in our
specific domain. As a secondary goal, we
apply our proposal also to PPAs in a different
domain (see section 5). Factors, enunciated
as heuristic rules, will act as constraints (F1
to F5) or preferences (F6), as established by
J. Carbonell (1988).

3.1. Syntactic level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934555555556">
Since typical syntactic constraints are
not suitable for PPA resolution, in our
approach we have limited the role of
syntactic knowledge to simple heuristic rules
based on surface patterns. Surface patterns
are typical expressions in the domain, which
gave information about PPAs antecedents. To
each relevant surface pattern, we have
associated a heuristic rule. Some of these
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99930512">
rules can directly elect, with high rate of
success, the most probable antecedent,
whereas others can only exclude a specific
candidate:
Fl - in the pattern &lt;NP and I or PPA&gt;, &lt;NP&gt;
must be elected the most probable antecedent
of &lt;PPA&gt;. Ex: &amp;quot;John and his dog&amp;quot;;
F2 - in the pattern &lt;of NP.. .of PPA&gt;, &lt;NP&gt;
must be elected the most probable antecedent
of &lt;PPA&gt;. This rule deals with some cases of
syntactic parallelism. Ex: &amp;quot;the death of Suzy,
of her children and...&amp;quot;;
F3 - in the patter &lt;NP of PPA&gt;, &lt;NP&gt; is not
a valid candidate for &lt;PPA&gt;. Ex: in &amp;quot;the
death of his son&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; is not a valid
candidate;
F4 - in the pattern &lt;NP of NP of NP... of
NP&gt;, only the full chain and the last NP can
be considered candidates for PPAs
antecedents, i.e., NPs in the middle of the
chain can be discarded. This rule adapts the
study developed by L. Kister (1995) for NP
chains in French, and it constitutes an
important mechanism for reducing the high
number of candidates in our current problem.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984744">
3.2. Semantic level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997414310344828">
Heuristic rules based on surface
patterns are not sufficient to discriminate
among a large set of candidates, as we found
in our domain. Thus, we also use semantic
knowledge in order to increase the results.
Our semantic approach considers possessive
relationship rules in the form &lt;Objl owns
Obj2 &gt;, used to represent &amp;quot;part-of&apos;
relationships between typical entities of the
domain, according to J. Pustejovsky&apos;s (1995)
semantic theory. For example, in our corpus
some PPAs can be solved with knowledge
such as &lt;city owns habitants&gt;, &lt;ecosystem
owns natural resources&gt; etc.
In order to apply this kind of
knowledge to the whole corpus, we have
defined object classes and possible
possessive relationships among them. For
example, for the anaphor &amp;quot;their hunt&amp;quot; in our
corpus, there is a semantic rule which expects
only a member of the class &lt;animals&gt; as a
suitable antecedent. Typical members of this
class would be &amp;quot;birds&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;mammals&amp;quot; and all
related expressions found in our corpus.
Based on this organization we have defined
another factor in PPA resolution:
F5 - There must be a valid possessive
relationship between a PPA and its
antecedent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980506">
3.3. Pragmatic level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873166666667">
Working together, surface patterns
and possessive relationships can deal with
many PPAs found in our corpus, but we still
have two problems to be solved: semantic
ambiguity among two or more acceptable
candidates and abstract anaphors/antecedents,
which cannot be solved by simply applying
possessive relationship rules.
For these cases, and possibly for some
other cases not included in previous rules, we
suggest a pragmatic factor, adapted from S.
Brennan&apos;s et al (1987) centering algorithm.
Although sentence center plays a crucial role
in many works in anaphor resolution, usually
limiting the number of candidates to be
considered, we notice that, because PPAs can
refer to almost any NP in the sentence (rather
than, for example, personal pronouns, which
are often related to the sentence center),
pragmatic knowledge plays only a secondary
- but still important - role in our approach.
We have adapted basic aspects of center
algorithm, considering subject/object
preference, and domain concepts preference,

suggested by R. Mitkov (1996), aiming to
estimate the most probable center for
intrasentential PPAs. Thus, in case of
ambiguity among candidates (after applying
factors Fl to F5), we will consider the
estimated center as the preferable PPA
antecedent. This constitutes our final rule:
F6 - the sentence center will be preferred
among remaining candidates.

<bodyText confidence="0.998515056603774">
Factors have been grouped in three
knowledge sources (KSs), as part of a
blackboard architecture, based on D.
Corkill&apos;s (1991) work, as shown in figure 1.
KSs are independent modules specialized in
different aspects of PPA resolution problem
(surface patterns, possessive relationships,
sentence center), providing both knowledge
and procedure distribution among
autonomous entities (specialists).
Since in our proposal knowledge and
procedure are represented by heuristic rules,
KSs have been implemented as reflexive
agents, according to S. J Russel &amp; P. Norvig
(1995) work. A reflexive agent is a rule-
based entity, which acts according to the
perceived environment (the blackboard
structure).
The blackboard is a global database
containing information about the problem
PPA
(PPA) to be solved: sentence structure
information and a set of hypotheses
(candidates) to be evaluated by specialists
(KSs). The specialists watch the blackboard,
looking for a PPA problem to be solved, and
evaluate the given data. Specialists can elect,
discard or assign preferable candidates,
according to their condition-action rules.
The resolution process is coordinated
by PPA solver agent, a specialist in PPA
resolution. When the PPA solver agent
receives a PPA resolution requirement, it
writes the initial data (in our current
implementation, for intrasentential PPAs, all
previous NPs in the sentence are considered
as part of the initial set of candidates) onto
the blackboard and activates the specialists.
After each contribution, the PPA solver
evaluates the number of remaining
candidates and the possible need for further
contributions. At the end of the cycle, in case
of ambiguity, the PPA solver will choose the
preferred candidate, as determined by the
sentence center specialist.
The motivations for adopting a
blackboard architecture are the benefits of
heterogeneous knowledge distribution and
independence among KSs. These benefits
will allow us to expand the architecture,
adding new factors in PPA resolution or even
adding new specialists, dedicated to different
anaphoric phenomena.

5. Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995636363636">
We have examined 198 PPAs from a
corpus on Brazilian laws about environment
protection. As a result of our implementation,
we have achieved a success rate of 92,97%.
We evaluate this result as very successful,
considering the small set of factors taken in
account.
We have also examined PPAs in a
second text genre, taking sentences from
magazine scientific articles. Within these
texts, we have taken 100 intrasentential
PPAs, and our strategy has chosen a correct
antecedent in 88% of the cases. This
deterioration, as a consequence of some
different surface pattern occurrences, is to be
expected in a new text genre.
As a future work, we aim to expand
the architecture, by means of adding new
specialists and improving the control
mechanism, in order to solve intersentential
PPAs and different kinds of pronouns, such
as demonstrative and personal.

Factors in PPA resolution This section describes a minimal set of factors in PPA resolution, based on corpus investigation. These factors will be considered in place of traditional syntactic constraints, which are not suitable for our present problem, as shown in section 2. In our proposal, because of the structural complexity of sentences in the domain, we have adopted a practical approach, based on simple heuristic rules, with a view to avoiding syntactic and semantic analysis. Similar strategies have been adopted in several recent works in anaphor resolution, such as T. Nasukawa (1994), R. Mitkov (1996), R. Vieira &amp; M. Poesio (1997) and others. We have defined 6 simple factors in PPA resolution (F1 to F6) based on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge, aiming to determine PPAs antecedents in our specific domain. As a secondary goal, we apply our proposal also to PPAs in a different domain (see section 5). Factors, enunciated as heuristic rules, will act as constraints (F1 to F5) or preferences (F6), as established by J. Carbonell (1988). 3.1. Syntactic level Since typical syntactic constraints are not suitable for PPA resolution, in our approach we have limited the ro</context>
