The NAACL-HLT 2007 / AMTA Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST)
took place on 26 April 2007 following the NAACL-HLT conference hosted by the University of
Rochester in New York. It was organized in response to growing interest in statistical, tree structured
models of relations between natural languages. Our hope was to bring together researchers working on
various aspects of this subject, and coming from various traditions. One way that the diversity of these
traditions can be seen is in their nomenclature: transduction grammars originated in formal language
theory (Lewis and Stearns 1968, Aho and Ullman 1969), and as interest in them was renewed in the
computational linguistics literature in the 1990s, they came to be also known as synchronous grammars.
Pushdown transducers and tree transducers, also introduced in the late 1960s, embody a less declarative,
rather more procedural view, but, in many cases, have transduction-grammar equivalents.
Another dimension of diversity is the variety of applications of synchronous/transduction grammars,
which is richly reflected in our workshop program. We selected fourteen papers, which include
papers on formal properties of synchronous/transduction grammars from both theoretical (Shieber) and
comparative experimental (Zhang and Gildea; Huang; Dreyer, Hall and Khudanpur) perspectives, and
papers applying synchronous/transduction grammars to machine translation as well as generation (Hall
and Nˇemec) and semantic interpretation (Nesson and Shieber). The invited speaker for the workshop
was William C. Rounds of the University of Michigan, a pioneer of tree-transducer theory who was one
of the first to explore the usefulness of tree transducers for natural language.
The papers included a wide spectrum of experiments trying different tradeoffs between representational
adequacy versus efficiency. Some models adopted binary-rank ITG or inversion transduction grammar
constraints (Cherry and Lin; Huang; Dreyer, Hall and Khudanpur), while others permitted up to STAG
or synchronous tree-adjoining grammar expressiveness (Nesson and Shieber; Shieber), with others in
between at the SDTG or syntax directed transduction grammar a.k.a. SCFG or synchronous context-
free grammar level (Zhang, Zens and Ney; Zhang and Gildea). Transduction rules ranged from mildly
hierarchical, heavily lexical transduction rules on one hand (Cherry and Lin; Zhang, Zens and Ney;
Venkatapathy and Bangalore; Dreyer, Hall and Khudanpur), to abstract transduction rules emphasizing
compositional syntax on the other (Nesson and Shieber; Hall and Nˇemec; Shieber).
A number of papers investigated machine learning techniques for inducing synchronous/transduction
grammars (Zhang, Zens and Ney; Cherry and Lin). Some of these focused on improving algorithms for
binarizing or reducing the rank of synchronous/transduction grammars (Zhang and Gildea; Huang). The
workshop also witnessed a number of papers proposing new ways of integrating tree structured models
into statistical methods in machine translation (Hopkins and Kuhn; Venkatapathy and Joshi; Bonneau-
Maynard, Allauzen, D´echelotte and Schwenk; Font Llitj´os and Vogel; Owczarzak, van Genabith and
Way; Venkatapathy and Bangalore).
The Association for Machine Translation in the Americas sponsored $1000 in scholarships for several
students to attend the workshop. We thank AMTA for their generosity, and we also thank the Program
Committee for their extremely quick reviews.
