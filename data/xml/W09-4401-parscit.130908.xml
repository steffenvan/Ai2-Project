This paper outlines a formal description of
grammatical relations between definitions and
verbal predications found in Definitional Contexts
in Spanish. It can be situated within the framework
of Predication Theory, a model derived from
Government &amp; Binding Grammar. We use this
model to describe: (i) the syntactic patterns that
establish the relationship between definitions and
predications; (ii) how useful these patterns are for
the identification of definitions in technical
corpora.

The (semi-)automatic recognition of terms and definitions
in a corpus is an important task to research areas such as
computational lexicography, terminology, language
engineering and others. In the case of term recognition,
several works report successful methodologies,
computational tools and experiments that aim to identify
and extract, in a no-supervised way, term candidates from
large specialized corpora (e. g. Cabré, Estopà &amp; Vivaldi
2001).
However, the automatic recognition of definitions
presents a much higher degree of complexity, since
definitions are linguistic structures used to formulate
concepts (Sager, 1990). In contrast to terms, which are
considered language units whose function is to refer
specific entities in a scientific or technical knowledge
domain, definitions condense information and establish
several conceptual relations, with the purpose to delimitate
the essential properties or attributes that characterize an
entity in relation to others.
There are currently many authors that have proposed
different methodologies for identifying candidates to

definitions, considering both linguistic and statistical points
of views. Some relevant methodologies are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.950497666666667">
• Definitional Sentences (fr. énonces définitoires):
Auger (1997), Rebeyrolle (2000).
• Terms in Contexts: Pearson (1998).
• Knowledge-Rich Contexts: Meyer (2001).
• Mining Definitions on Texts: Malaisé,
Zweigenbaum &amp; Bachimont (2005).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
In accordance with these methodologies, in this paper we
present a methodology to identify different types of
definitions in technical corpora, considering that these
definitions are configured as grammatical patterns, in
particular, as phrase structures. These patterns are linked to
verbal predications with syntactic regularities.
For the syntactic analysis of these patterns, we use a
formal model called Predication Theory (henceforth,
PredT). This model is formulated within the framework of
Government &amp; Binding Grammar (Rothstein, 1983; Bowers
1993, 2001. So, the PredT allows us to describe, in a formal
way, the grammatical relations that definitions establish
with verbal predications. Taking this relationship into
account, it is possible to identify good candidates to
definitions considering their association with verbal
predications, specifically when these definitions are
introduced in scientific and technical texts.

2. Definitional Contexts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997322375">
We situate this analysis within the framework of
Definitional Contexts (or DCs) extraction. According to
Sierra et al. (2008), a DC is a discursive structure that
contains relevant information to define a term. A DC has at
least two constituents: a term and a definition, and usually
linguistic or metalinguistic forms, such as verbal phrases,
typographical markers and/or pragmatic patterns. An
example is:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.45300975">
1. In general, the paraprofessional workers are defined
as those persons who are engaged in the provision of
social care or social services, but who do not have
professional training or qualifications.

Workshop On Definition Extraction 2009 - Borovets, Bulgaria, pages 1–6,
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931090909091">
According to this example, the term Paraprofessional
workers is emphasised by the use of bold font; the verbal
predication are defined as links the term paraprofessional
workers to the actual definition those persons who are
engaged... The term, the verbal predication and the
definition are discursive units introduced by the pragmatic
pattern In general. These are the three units that constitute
the main syntactic sequence of a DC.
In this work we study this kind of DCs in Spanish,
where the association between definitions and verbal
predications is made explicit.

3. A formal description respect to
predication
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859133333333">
Taking into consideration that these sequences are
composed of a verbal predication and definitions, several
authors have found and reported such sequences for English
(Pearson, 1998; Meyer 2001; Malaisé, Zweigenbaum &amp;
Bachimont, 2005) and French (Auger 1997, Rebeyrolle
2000). These authors have considered the use of these types
of verbal predications as useful patterns for the
(semi)automatic extraction of information associated to
definitions.
However, none of these authors have analysed the
nature of the relations between predications and definitions.
In this paper, we focus on the description of their nature at
the syntactic level, based on the PredT as a pertinent formal
model for explaining the relations established between
verbal predications and definitions.

3.1 Predication theory in GB grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969759">
Grosso modo, PredT is a model derived from Government
&amp; Binding Grammar, formulated by Chomsky (1981).
PredT postulates that all predications indicate a semantic
relationship between an entity and a particular property or
characteristic feature. Syntactically, PredT explains all
verbal predications as a type of phrase, structured around a
relation X-is-a-Subject-of/Y-is-a-predicate-of. This relation
is regulated by a syntactic rule named rule of predicate
linking, proposed by Rothstein (1983). Examples of these
relations are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8456815">
2. a. John is an intelligent professor.
b. John considers his father as an intelligent professor.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9962285">
Following Rothstein’s explanation, Bowers (1993, 2001)
develops a simple model to describe the syntactic
configuration of these phrases, called Predicative Phrase
(PrP). The PrP is mapped by a non-lexical head (that is, a
functional head), and its grammatical behaviour is similar to
that of phrases such as Inflexional Phrase (IP) or
Complement Phrase (CP). A graphical tree representation
of a PrP is:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998796">
Figure 1: Tree representation for PrP, according to Bowers (1993:
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9245842">
596).
Figure 1 shows the basic elements that make up a PrP.
Bowers recognise a functional head with the features +/-
predicative (Pr). This head maps two Subjects, a primary
subject in the position of Specifier of PrP (represented by a
Noun Phrase or NP); and a secondary subject, in the
position of Specifier of Verbal Phrase or VP (often a NP).
Finally, both subjects, the VP and the PrP are linked to one
or several complements, which assume many phrasal
representations (e.g. NP, IP, CP, and so on).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999364">
3.2 Primary and secondary predications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.907158">
Based on this distinction between primary and secondary
subjects, it is possible to recognise two types of
predications:
 Simple or primary predication, consisting of a
subject to the left of the verb (in position of
Specifier of PrP), and a predicate to the right of
the verb. An example in Spanish is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9736805">
3. [Una computadora [es [un tipo de máquina electrónica que
sirve para hacer operaciones PrP] VP] IP] (Eng. [A computer
[is [a kind of electronic machine used to make operations
PrP] VP] IP]).
 Double or secondary predication, which integrates
a primary subject in a pre-verbal position, a
secondary subject (situated as Specifier of VP),
and the predicate. For example, again, in Spanish:
4. [Turing [define una computadora [como un mecanismo
electrónico que procesa conjuntos de datos PrP] VP] IP]
(Eng. [Turing [defines a computer [as a kind of electronic
device that processes a set of data PrP] VP] IP]).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934285714286">
In (4), the predicate como un mecanismo electrónico...
(Engl. as a kind of electronic device...) affects the
secondary subject una computadora (Engl. a computer), in
accordance with the explanation provided by Bowers
(1993). For our analysis, we consider both types of
predications as regular patterns that syntactically codify
sequences of terms, verbal predications and definitions.

<bodyText confidence="0.9411676">
4. Combinatory of patterns in DCs
Based on our formal description of PrP, it is possible to
identify two types of patterns that structure particular
sequences in DCs:
 In the case of primary predications, it codifies a
sequence composed of a Term, a Verbal
Predication and a Definition.
 In the case of secondary predication, it codifies a
sequence composed of a specific Author, a Term,
a Verbal Predication and a Definition.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976989">
4.1. Term + Verbal Predication + Definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909">
This sequence is a good example of a formulation of
canonical definitional patterns, because the primary
predication links directly a subject represented by a term,
with a specific set of attributes codified in the PrP. These
patterns are shown in the following sequences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.871465230769231">
5. a. [El contenedor refrigerado Term] [es Verbal Predication] [una
forma especializada de transporte de perecederos Definition]
(Eng. [The refrigerated container Term] [is Verbal Predication] [a
specialized form to transport perishable goods Definition])
b. [Un esquema XML Term] [representa Verbal Predication] [el
significado y la estructura de la información recibida
desde una aplicación Definition] (Eng. [An XML schema Term]
[represents Verbal Predication] [the meaning and structure of the
information received from an application Definition]).
c. [Una jerarquía de dependencias Term] [se refiere a Verbal
Predication] [todas las tablas que incluyen referencias mutuas
Definition] (Eng. [A hierarchy of units Term] [refers to Term] [all
tables that include references to each other Definition]).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999467666666667">
The sequence Term + Verbal Predication + Definition in
cases 5 a-c is equivalent to the structure of primary
predication. Therefore, the Term is situated in the position
of Primary Subject, the Verbal Predication has the role of
head of a VP, and the Definition is introduced through a
PrP.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.5185615" genericHeader="method">
4.2. Author + Term + Verbal Predication +
Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998637">
The second sequence we report here shows the sequence
Author + Term + Verbal Predication + Definition. The
characteristic feature of this pattern is that it explicitly points
out the author (or authors) of the definition. This feature
maps a semantic role, according to FrameNet (Baker,
Fillmore and Lowe, 1998), concretely the author can be
conceived as a Cognizer that associates certain Categories
(the Definition) to a particular Item (that is, the Term). This
is illustrated in the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.866745692307692">
6. a. [Carlos Godino Author] [define Verbal Predication] [la arquitectura
naval Term] [como la ciencia que se enfoca en la
construcción de los buques Definition] (Eng. [Carlos Godino
Author] [defines Verbal Predication] [naval architecture Term] [as
the science that focuses on the construction of ships
Definition])
b. [El artículo Author] [describe Verbal Predication] [la evolución de
ecología del paisaje Term] [como una ciencia integrativa y
transdisciplinaria Definition] (Eng. [The article Author]
[describes Verbal Predication] [the evolution of landscape
ecology Term] [as an integrative and interdisciplinary
science Definition]).

evolución de sistemas antiguos de cálculo o de ordenación
Definition] (Eng. [We Author] [can consider Verbal Predication] [the
modern programmable computers Term] [as the evolution
of ancient systems of calculation and management
Definition]).
Hence, the pattern followed by this sequence clearly refers
to the author of a definition, as shown in 6 a-c. However, a
syntactic behaviour observed in this pattern is its recurrent
configuration in non-personal forms, i.e. impersonal and
passive forms, for example:
7. a. [Se conoce como Verbal Predication] [reenganche rápido Term]
[a la operación de cierre de un interruptor después de una
falla Definition] (Eng. [It is known as Verbal Predication] [Quick
Re-closing Term] [to the operation of a switch after a fault
Definition]).
b. [Los niveles relativos de los alcances de ola Term] [fueron
descritos como Verbal Predication] [una función del parámetro
de similitud de oleaje Definition] (Eng. [The relative levels of
the wave reach Term] [were described as Verbal Predication] [a
function of the wave similarity parameter Definition]
In these examples, we observe the use of non-personal
verbal patterns as in (7a), where the clitic Se is inserted
(Eng. It) to make the sentence impersonal, or in (7b), which
is in the passive form. So, when these sequences assume a
non-personal pattern, they become equivalent to primary
predications, where there is not an explicit mention of the
author of a definition.
5. Types of definitions linked to
predications
Another aspect that we found in the relation between
predications and definitions is the influence of the
predication on the selection of a particular type of
definition. In fact, this influence is important because we
can establish and formalise a possible grammar model that
helps to identify different kinds of definitions, given a
primary or secondary predication.
Following Sierra et al. (2008) and Aguilar (2009), we
outline a typology with 4 types of definitions: analytical,
synonymical, functional and extensional. These definitions
are derived from Aristotle’s model:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.714065666666667">
Synonymical Functional Extensional
Genus Term
Differentia

<figureCaption confidence="0.9957015">
Figure 2. Typology of definitions based on Aristotle’s model
(Sierra et al. 2008: 81).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.995407428571429">
Figure 2 illustrates how these four types of definitions can
be identified according to the presence/absence of Genus
Term and/or Differentia in a good candidate of definition.
So, when both the Genus Term and the Differentia are
explicit, we have an analytical definition, which can be
associated with two kinds of predication: primary
predication or secondary predication.
When only the Genus Term is explicit, there is a
certain relation of conceptual equivalence between the term
and its definition. So, following Cruse (1986), we
characterise this definition as synonymical.
In contrast, when only the Differentia is explicit, we
have two options:
 The first one describes the use or the function of an
entity represented by the term, that is, a functional
definition.
 The second one enumerates all the components of a
possible entity or a possible set, that is, an
extensional definition.
In the following sections we briefly describe each type of
definition.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990982">
5.1. Analytical definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995652384615385">
This definition occurs associated with primary and
secondary predications. In the case of primary predication,
the analytical definition is integrated in a sequence Term +
Verbal Predication + Definition. This definition does not
explicitly state the author of a definition. For example:
8. [El apartarrayos Term] [es Verbal Predication] [un dispositivo
Genus Term] [que protege las instalaciones contra
sobretensiones de origen atmosférico Differentia] (Engl.
[The lightning conductor Term] [is Verbal Predication] [a device
Genus Term] [that protects electrical systems against surges
of atmospheric origin Differentia]).
We propose a possible grammatical description
model for this relation:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.999532375">
Definition Genus Term Differentia
Analytical Noun Phrase = Noun + Complement Phrase =
(Simple {Adjective Relative Pronoun +

<bodyText confidence="0.999698444444445">
In the case of secondary predications linked to
analytical definitions, they follow the sequence
Author + Term + Verbal Predication + Definition,
where the Author is equivalent to the primary
subject, the Term assumes the position of secondary
subject, and the definition is introduced after the
Verbal Predication. In this case, the adverbial
particle como (Eng. as/like), or the preposition por
(Eng. for/by) indicate the place of the definition:

5.2. Synonymous definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807666666667">
The synonymous definitions have a syntactic relation with
primary predications, specifically with the Genus Term, but
not with the differentia. An example is:

<listItem confidence="0.693987333333333">

<bodyText confidence="0.99935675">
In (9), we observe that the Term la tensión de base (Engl.
the base tension) establishes a relation of cognitive
equivalent with the Genus Term tensión unidad (Engl. unit
tension). We formalise this relation in table 3:

5.3. Functional definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9879981">
The functional verbal pattern introduces a type of definition where
the Genus Term is absent, but introduces a Differentia that
describes the function or the use of a particular entity. The verbal
pattern is also associated with a primary predication. The example
is:
10. [La técnica de velocimetría de imágenes Term] [permite Verbal
Predication] [medir la velocidad de un campo de flujo bi o tri

are structured around a primary predication. An example is:

In this paper, we have outlined a formal description of the
grammatical relations that can be established between
definitions and verbal predications in DCs. We consider
this is a pertinent way to analyse the syntactic behaviour of
definitions in specialised texts, specifically when these
definitions are linked to verbal predications.
We have described these verbal predications
according to the PredT, a grammatical model useful to
formalise patterns generated by the association of verbal
predications to specific definitions. This description
allowed us to distinguish:
 Two types of verbal predications: primary and
secondary predications. Both predications entail
particular types of definitions, depending on the verb
that functions as the head of the predication.
 These predications play an important role in the
selection and introduction of specific types of
definitions. In this paper, we have proposed a
possible typology of definitions, based on the role
played by predications. This typology considers four
types of definitions: analytical, synonymical,
functional and extensional.
 In addition, it is possible to observe that the relation
established between the types of definitions with
primary/secondary predications configure two
sequences that structure two different kinds of DCs:
(i) a sequence, Term + Verbal Predication +
Definition, configured in primary predications which
can be linked to analytical, synonymical, functional
and extensional definitions and; (ii) another
sequence, Author + Term + Verbal Predication +
Definition, delineated by secondary predications
which can be associated to secondary predications.
We think that the use of these patterns proposed in our
analysis can sketch a useful grammatical model, applied
to the task of (semi)automatic recognition and extraction
of definitions in Spanish, from text corpora.

<abstract confidence="0.998974583333333">This paper outlines a formal description of grammatical relations between definitions and verbal predications found in Definitional Contexts in Spanish. It can be situated within the framework of Predication Theory, a model derived from Government &amp; Binding Grammar. We use this model to describe: (i) the syntactic patterns that establish the relationship between definitions and predications; (ii) how useful these patterns are for the identification of definitions in technical corpora.</abstract>
