The Prague Czech-English Dependency Tree-
bank (PCEDT) is a new syntactically annotated
Czech-English parallel resource. The Penn
Treebank has been translated to Czech, and its
annotation automatically transformed into de-
pendency annotation scheme. The dependency
annotation of Czech is done from plain text by
automatic procedures. A small subset of cor-
responding Czech and English sentences has
been annotated by humans. We discuss some
of the problems we have experienced during
the automatic transformation between annota-
tion schemes and hint at some of the difficulties
to be tackled by potential guidelines for depen-
dency annotation of English.

<bodyText confidence="0.999869243243243">
The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
(PCEDT) is a project of creating a Czech-English
syntactically annotated parallel corpus motivated by
research in the field of machine translation. Parallel data
are needed for designing, training, and evaluation of both
statistical and rule-based machine translation systems.
Since Czech is a language with relatively high degree
of word-order freedom, and its sentences contain certain
syntactic phenomena, such as discontinuous constituents
(non-projective constructions), which cannot be straight-
forwardly handled using the annotation scheme of Penn
Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Linguistic Data Consor-
tium, 1999), based on phrase-structure trees, we decided
to adopt for the PCEDT the dependency-based annotation
scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank – PDT (Lin-
guistic Data Consortium, 2001). The PDT is annotated
on three levels: morphological layer (lowest), analytic
layer (middle) – surface syntactic annotation, and tec-
togrammatical layer (highest) – level of linguistic mean-
ing. Dependency trees, representing the sentence struc-
ture as concentrated around the verb and its valency, are
used for the analytical and tectogrammatical levels, as
proposed by Functional Generative Description (Sgall et
al., 1986).
In Section 2, we describe the process of translating the
Penn Treebank into Czech. Section 3 sketches the gen-
eral procedure for transforming phrase topology of Penn
Treebank into dependency structure and describes the
specific conversions into analytical and tectogrammatical
representations. The following Section 4 describes the
automatic process of parsing of Czech into analytical rep-
resentation and its automatic conversion into tectogram-
matical representation. Section 5 briefly discusses some
of the problems of annotation from the point of view of
mutual compatibility of annotation schemes. Section 6
gives an overview of additional resources included in the
PCEDT.

When starting the PCEDT project, we chose the latter of
two possible strategies: either the parallel annotation of
already existing parallel texts, or the translation and anno-
tation of an existing syntactically annotated corpus. The
choice of the Penn Treebank as the source corpus was
also pragmatically motivated: firstly it is a widely rec-
ognized linguistic resource, and secondly the translators
were native speakers of Czech, capable of high quality
translation into their native language.
The translators were asked to translate each English
sentence as a single Czech sentence and to avoid unneces-
sary stylistic changes of translated sentences. The trans-
lations are being revised on two levels, linguistic and fac-
tual. About half of the Penn Treebank has been translated
so far (currently 21,628 sentences), the project aims at
translating the whole Wall Street Journal part of the Penn
Treebank.

translation systems, we selected a test set of 515 sen-

the Czech Republic and two of them from the U.S.A.

3 Transformation of Penn Treebank

<bodyText confidence="0.991383">
The transformation algorithm from phrase-structure
topology into dependency one, similar to transformations
described by Xia and Palmer (2001), works as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996128083333333">
• Terminal nodes of the phrase are converted to nodes
of the dependency tree.
• Dependencies between nodes are established recur-
sively: The root node of the dependency tree trans-
formed from the head constituent of a phrase be-
comes the governing node. The root nodes of the
dependency trees transformed from the right and left
siblings of the head constituent are attached as the
left and right children (dependent nodes) of the gov-
erning node, respectively.
• Nodes representing traces are removed and their
children are reattached to the parent of the trace.

reasons of symmetry with Czech data and compatibility
with the dependency annotation scheme, the English part
was automatically lemmatized by the morpha tool (Min-
nen et al., 2001) using manually assigned POS tags of the
Penn Treebank.

The structural transformation works as described
above. Because the handling of coordination in PDT is
different from the Penn Treebank annotation style and
the output of Jason Eisner’s head assigning scripts, in
the case of a phrase containing a coordinating conjunc-
tion (CC), we consider the rightmost CC as the head. The
treatment of apposition is a more difficult task, since there
is no explicit annotation of this phenomenon in the Penn
Treebank; constituents of a noun phrase enclosed in com-
mas or other delimiters (and not containing CC) are con-
sidered to be in apposition and the rightmost delimiter
becomes the head.
The information from both the phrase tree and the de-
pendency tree is used for the assignment of analytical
functions:

assigns the function tag AuxV to a modal verb
headed by a verb, etc. The attribute mPOS repre-
senting the POS of a node is obligatory for every
rule. The rules are examined primarily in the order
of the longest prefix of the POS of the given node
and secondarily in the order as they are listed in the
rule file. The ordering of rules is important, since
the first matching rule found assigns the analytical
function and the search is finished.
Specifics of the PDT and Penn Treebank annotation
schemes, mainly the markup of coordinations, apposi-
tions, and prepositional phrases are handled separately:

<listItem confidence="0.958984384615385">
• Coordinations and appositions: the analytical func-
tion that was originally assigned to the head of a
coordination or apposition is propagated to its child
nodes by attaching the suffix Co or Ap to them, and
the head node gets the analytical function Coord or
Apos, respectively.
• Prepositional phrases: the analytical function origi-
nally assigned to the preposition node is propagated
to its child and the preposition node is labeled AuxP.
• Sentences in the PDT annotation style always con-
tain a root node labeled AuxS, which, as the only one
in the dependency tree, does not correspond to any
terminal of the phrase tree; the root node is inserted

3.3 English Tectogrammatical Dependency Trees
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996977020408163">
The transformation of Penn Treebank phrase trees into
tectogrammatical representation consists of a structural
transformation, and an assignment of a tectogrammat-
ical functor and a set of grammatemes to each node.
At the beginning of the structural transformation, the
initial dependency tree is created by a general transfor-
mation procedure as described above. However, func-
tional (synsemantic) words, such as prepositions, punc-
tuation marks, determiners, subordinating conjunctions,
certain particles, auxiliary and modal verbs are handled
differently. They are marked as “hidden” and information
about them is stored in special attributes of their govern-
ing nodes (if they were to head a phrase, the head of the
other constituent became the governing node in the de-
pendency tree).
The well-formedness of a tectogrammatical tree struc-
ture requires the valency frames to be complete: apart
from nodes that are realized on surface, there are several
types of “restored” nodes representing the non-realized
members of valency frames (cf. pro-drop property of
Czech and verbal condensations using gerunds and in-
finitives both in Czech and English). For a partial recon-
struction of such nodes, we can use traces, which allow
us to establish coreferential links, or restore general par-
ticipants in the valency frames.
For the assignment of tectogrammatical functors, we
can use rules taking into consideration POS tags (e.g.
PRP —&gt; APP), function tags (JJ —&gt; RSTR, JJR —&gt; CPR,
etc.) and lemma (“not” —&gt; RHEM, “both” —&gt; RSTR).
Grammateme Assignment – morphological gram-
matemes (e.g. tense, degree of comparison) are assigned
to each node of the tectogrammatical tree. The assign-
ment of the morphological attributes is based on Pen-
nTreebank tags and reflects basic morphological proper-
ties of the language. At the moment, there are no auto-
matic tools for the assignment of syntactic grammatemes,
which are designed to capture detailed information about
deep syntactic structure.
The whole procedure is described in detail in
Kuˇcerov´a and ˇZabokrtsk´y (2002).
In order to gain a “gold standard” annotation, 1,257
sentences have been annotated manually (the 515 sen-
tences from the test set are among them). These data
are assigned morphological gramatemes (the full set of
values) and syntactic grammatemes, and the nodes are
reordered according to topic-focus articulation (informa-
tion structure).

whose counterparts in Czech occur rarely, and therefore
are not handeled thoroughly by the guidelines for tec-
togrammatical annotation designed for Czech. To men-
tion just a few, among the former belongs the annotation
of articles, certain aspects of the system of verbal tenses,
and phrasal verbs. A specimen of a roughly correspond-
ing phenomenon occurring both in Czech and English is
the gerund. It is a very common means of condensation
in English, but its counterpart in Czech (usually called
transgressive) has fallen out of use and is nowadays con-
sidered rather obsolete.
The guidelines for Czech require the transgressive to
be annotated with the functor COMPL. The reason why it is
highly problematic to apply them straightforwardly also
to the annotation of English, is that the English gerund
has a much wider range of functions than the Czech trans-
gressive. The gerund can be seen as a means of con-
densing subordinated clauses with in principle adverbial
meaning (as it is analyzed in the phrase-structure annota-
tion of Penn Treebank). Since the range of functors with
adverbial meaning is much more fine-grained, we deem it
inappropriate to mark the gerund clauses in such a simple
way on the tectogrammatical level.
From the point of view of machine translation, the
gerund constructions pose considerable difficulties be-
cause of the many syntactic constructions suitable as their
translations corresponding to their varied syntactic func-
tions.
We present two examples illustrating the issues men-
tioned above. Each example consists of three figures, the
first one presenting the Penn Treebank annotation of a (in
the second case simplified) sentence from the Penn Tree-
bank, the second one giving its tentative tectogrammatic
representation (according to the guidelines for Czech ap-
plied to English), and the third one containing the tec-
togrammatical representation of its translation into Czech
(see Figures 1, 3, 5, and Figures 6, 7, 8). Note that in nei-
ther of the two examples the Czech transgressive is used
as the translation of the English gerund; a coordination
structure is used instead.
On the other hand, we have also experienced phenom-
ena in English whose Penn Treebank style of annotation
is insufficient for a successfull conversion into depen-
dency representation.
In English, the usage of constructions with nominal
premodification is very frequent, and the annotation of
such noun phrases in the Penn Treebank is often flat,
grouping together several constituents without reflecting
finer syntactic and semantic relations among them (see
Figure 9 for an example of such a noun phrase). In fact,
the possible syntactic and especially semantic relations
between the members of the noun phrase can be highly
ambiguous, but when translating such a noun phrase into
Czech, we are not usually able to preserve the ambiguity
and are forced to resolve it by choosing one of the read-
ings (see Figure 10).
Sometimes we even may be forced to insert new words
explicitly expressing the semantic relations within the
nominal group. An example of an English noun phrase
and the tectogrammatical representation of its Czech
translation with an inserted word “podnikajici” (‘operat-
ing’) can be found in Figures 11 and 12.

The PCEDT comprises also a translation dictionary com-
piled from three different Czech-English manual dictio-
naries: two of them were downloaded form the Web and
one was extracted from Czech and English EuroWord-
Nets. Entry-translation pairs were filtered and weighed
taking into account the reliability of the source dictio-
nary, the frequencies of the translations in Czech and En-
glish monolingual corpora, and the correspondence of the
Czech and English POS tags. Furthermore, by training
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) translation model on the
training part of the PCEDT extended by the manual dic-
tionaries, we obtained a probabilistic Czech-English dic-
tionary, more sensitive to the domain of financial news

The resulting Czech-English probabilistic dictionary

where for each entry-translation pair all the correspond-

SMT Quick Run is a package of scripts and instructions
for building statistical machine translation system from
the PCEDT or any other parallel corpus. The system uses
models GIZA++ and ISI ReWrite decoder (Germann et
al., 2001).
TrEd is a graphical editor and viewer of tree structures.
Its modular architecture allows easy handling of diverse
annotation schemes, it has been used as the principal an-
notation environment for the PDT and PCEDT.
Netgraph is a multi-platform client-server application
for browsing, querying and viewing analytical and tec-
togrammatical dependency trees, either over the Internet
or locally.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987958333333">
We have described the process of building the first ver-
sion of a parallel treebank for two relatively distant lan-
guages, Czech and English, during which we have also
attempted to reconcile two fairly incompatible linguistic
theories used for their description.
The resulting data collection contains data syntacti-
cally annotated on several layers of analysis. There have
already been experimental machine translation systems
MAGENTA (Hajiˇc et al., 2002) and DBMT ( ˇCmejrek
et al., 2003) confirming the exploitability of the corpus
and showing that we are capable of performing auto-
matic transformations from phrase structures to depen-
dency representation with an acceptable, though still not
impeccable quality.
However, for both languages, we have presented ex-
amples of phenomena, for which the “native” annotation
scheme does not provide a sufficiently fine-grained anal-
ysis. In such cases, automatic conversion between anno-
tation schemes is not possible, and the less we can hope
for successfull machine translation.
The question of enhancing the annotation schemes to
allow for a lossless transformation between them remains
still open, and its difficulty presents a yet unfathomed
depth.

<abstract confidence="0.9893761875">The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT) is a new syntactically annotated Czech-English parallel resource. The Penn Treebank has been translated to Czech, and its annotation automatically transformed into dependency annotation scheme. The dependency annotation of Czech is done from plain text by automatic procedures. A small subset of corresponding Czech and English sentences has been annotated by humans. We discuss some of the problems we have experienced during the automatic transformation between annotation schemes and hint at some of the difficulties to be tackled by potential guidelines for dependency annotation of English.</abstract>

Marking of Heads in English The concept of the head of a phrase is important during the tranformation described above. For marking head constituents in each phrase, we used Jason Eisner’s scripts. Lemmatization of English Czech is an inflective language, rich in morphology, therefore lemmatization (assigning base forms) is indispensable in almost any linguistic application. Mostly for reasons of symmetry with Czech data and compatibility with the dependency annotation scheme, the English part was automatically lemmatized by the morpha tool (Minnen et al., 2001) using manually assigned POS tags of the Penn Treebank.
