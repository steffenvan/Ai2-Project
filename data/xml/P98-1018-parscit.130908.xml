Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999963882352941">
This paper examines the phenomenon of conso-
nant spreading in Arabic sterns. Each spread-
ing involves a local surface copying of an un-
derlying consonant, and, in certain phonologi-
cal contexts, spreading alternates productively
with consonant lengthening (or gemination).
The morphophonemic triggers of spreading lie
in the patterns or even in the roots themselves,
and the combination of a spreading root and
a spreading pattern causes a consonant to be
copied multiple times. The interdigitation of
Arabic stems and the realization of consonant
spreading are formalized using finite-state mor-
photactics and variation rules, and this ap-
proach has been successfully implemented in a
large-scale Arabic morphological analyzer which
is available for testing on the Internet.

Most formal analyses of Semitic languages, in-
cluding Arabic, defend the reality of abstract,
unpronounceable morphemes called ROOTS,
consisting usually of three, but sometimes two
or four, consonants called RADICALS. The clas-
sic examples include ktb a1)1, appearing
in a number of words having to do with writ-
ing, books, schools, etc.; and drs .)), ap-
pearing in words having to do with studying,
learning, teaching, etc. Roots combine non-
concatenatively with PATTERNS to form STEMS,
a process known informally as INTERDIGITA-
TION or INTERCALATION. We shall look first
at Arabic stems in general before examining
GEMINATION and SPREADING, related phenom-
ena wherein a single underlying radical is real-

The stems in Figure 12 share the drs root mor-
pheme, and indeed they are traditionally or-
ganized under a drs heading in printed lexi-
cons like the authoritative Dictionary of Mod-
ern Written Arabic of Hans VVehr (1979).
A root morpheme like drs interdigitates with
a pattern morpheme, or, in some analyses.
with a pattern and a separate vocalization mor-
pheme, to form abstract stems. Because inter-
digitation involves pattern elements being in-
serted between the radicals of the root mor-
pheme, Semitic stem formation is a classic
example of non-concatenative morphotactics.
Separating and identifying the component mor-
phemes of words is of course the core task of
morphological analysis for any language, and
analyzing Semitic stems is a classic challenge

1.2 Interdigitation as Intersection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.927038492063492">
Finite-state morphology is based on the
claim that both morphotactics and phonologi-
cal/orthographical variation rules, i.e. the rela-
tion of underlying forms to surface forms, can
be formalized using finite-state automata (Ka-
plan and Nay, 1981; Karttunen, 1991; Kaplan
and Nay, 1994). Although the most acces-
sible computer implementations (Koskenniemi,
1983; Antworth, 1990; Karttunen, 1993) of
finite-state morphotactics have been limited to
building words via the concatenation of mor-
phemes, the theory itself does not have this limi-
tation. In Semitic morphotactics, root and pat-
tern morphemes (and, according to one&apos;s the-
ory, perhaps separate vocalization morphemes)
are naturally formalized as regular languages,
and stems are formed by the intersection, rather
than the concatenation, of these regular lan-
guages. Such analyses have been laid out else-
where (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley,
1998a; Beesley, 1998b) and cannot be repeated
here. For present purposes, it will suffice to view
morphophonemic (underlying) stems as being
formed from the intersection of a root and a pat-
tern, where patterns contain vowels and C slots
into which root radicals are, intuitively speak-
ing, &amp;quot;plugged&amp;quot;, as in the following Form I per-
fect active and passive verb examples.
Root: d r s k t b
Pattern: CaCaC CaCaC
Stem: daras katab
Root: d r s k t b
Pattern: CuCiC CuCiC
Stem: duris kutib qutil
Prefixes and suffixes concatenate onto the stems
in the usual way to form complete, but still mor-
phophonemic, words; and finite-state variation
rules are then applied to map the morphophone-
mic strings into strings of surface phonemes or
orthographical characters. For an overview of
this approach, see Karttunen, Kaplan and Zae-
nen (1992).
Following Harris (1941) and Hudson (1986),
and unlike McCarthy (1981), we also allow the
patterns to contain non-radical consonants as
in the following perfect active Form VII, Form
VIII and Form X examples.
Form VII Form VIII Form X
Root: ktb k tb kt b
Pattern: nCaCaC CtaCaC staCCaC
Stem: nkatab ktatab staktab
In this formalization, noun patterns work ex-
actly like verb patterns, as in the following ex-
amples:
Root: k t b k t b kt b
Pattern: CiCaaC CuCuC maCCuuC
Stem: kitaab kutub maktuub
Gloss: &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; &amp;quot;letter&amp;quot;
Where such straightforward intersection of
roots and patterns into stems would appear to
break down is in cases of gemination and spread-
ing, where a single root radical appears multiple
times in a surface stem.

2 Arabic Consonant Gemination and

2.1 Gemination in Forms II and V
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993803636363636">
Some verb and noun stems exhibit a double re-
alization (a copying) of an underlying radical,
resulting in gemination3 or spreading at the sur-
face level. Looking at gemination first, it is best
known from verb stems known in the European
tradition as Forms II and V, where the middle
radical is doubled. Kay&apos;s (1987) pattern nota-
tion uses a G symbol before the C slot that
needs to be doubled.&apos;
3 Gemination in Arabic words can alternatively be an-
alyzed as consonant lengthening, as in Harris (1941) and
as implied by Holes (1995). This solution is very attrac-
tive if the goal is to generate fully-voweled orthograph-
ical surface strings of Arabic, but for the phonological
examples in this paper we adopt the gemination repre-
sentation as used by phonologists like McCarthy (1981).
4 Kay&apos;s stem-building mechanism, using a multi-tape
transducer implemented in Prolog, sees G on the pattern
tape and writes a copy of the middle radical on the stern
tape without consuming it. Then the following C does
the same but consumes the radical symbol in the usual
way. Kay&apos;s analysis in fact abstracts out the vocaliza-

In the same spirit, but with a different mecha-

As in all cases, the stem is formed by straight-
forward intersection, resulting in abstract stems
like darXas. The X symbol is subsequently re-
alized via finite-state variation rules as a copy of
the preceding consonant in a phonological gram-
mar (/darras/) or, in an orthographical system
such as ours, as an optionally written shadda di-
acritic (0...:5S). Finite-state rules to effect such

2.2 Gemination/Spreading in Form IX
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998980884615384">
Spreading, which appears to involve consonant
copying over intervening phonemes, is not so
different from gemination; and indeed it is com-
mon in &amp;quot;spreading&amp;quot; verb stems for the spread-
ing to alternate productively with gemination.
The best known example of Arabic consonant
spreading is the verbal stem known as Form
IX (the same behavior is also seen in Form
XI, Form XIV, Form QIV and in several noun
forms). A typical example is the root dhm
(r a which in Form IX has the meaning &amp;quot;be-
come black&amp;quot;.
Spreading is not terribly common in Modern
Standard Arabic, but it occurs in enough verb
and noun forms to deserve, in our opinion, full
treatment. In our lexicon of about 4930 roots,
tion, placing it on a separate transducer tape, but this
difference is not important here. For extensions of this
multi-tape approach see Kiraz (1994; 1996). The cur-
rent approach differs from the multi-tape approaches in
formalizing roots, patterns and vocalizations as regular
languages and by computing (&amp;quot;linearizing&amp;quot;) the stems
at compile time via intersection of these regular lan-
guages (Beesley, 1998a; Beesley, 1998b).
5See, for example, the rules of Antworth (1990) for
handling the limited reduplication seen in Tagalog.

20 have Form IX possibilities (see Figure 2).
Most of them (but not all) share the general
meaning of being or becoming a certain color.
McCarthy (1981) and others (Kay, 1987; Ki-
raz, 1994; Bird and Blackburn, 1991) postulate
an underlying Form IX stem for dhm that looks
like dhamam, with a spreading of the final m
radical; other writers like Beeston (1968) list the
stem as dhamm, with a geminated or length-
ened final radical. In fact, both forms do oc-
cur in full surface words as shown in Figure 3,
and the difference is productively and straight-
forwardly phonological. For perfect endings like
+a (le&apos;) and +at (&apos;she&apos;), the final consonant is
geminated (or &amp;quot;lengthened&amp;quot;, depending on your
formal point of view). If, however, the suffix be-
gins with a consonant, as in +tu ( &apos;I&apos;) or +ta
(&apos;you, masc. sg.&apos;), then the separated or true
spreading occurs.

notation of Beeston, it is tempting to formal-
ize the underlying Form IX perfect active pat-
tern as CCaCX so that it intersects with root
dhm to form dhamX. When followed by a suf-
fix beginning with a vowel such as +a or +at,
phonologically oriented variation rules would re-
alize the X as a copy of the preceding consonant
(/dhamm/). Arabic abhors consonant clus-
ters, and it resorts to various &amp;quot;cluster busting&amp;quot;
techniques to eliminate them. The final phono-
logical realization would include an epentheti-
cal /2i/ on the front, to break up the dh clus-
ter, and would treat the copied m as the on-
set of a syllable that includes the suffix: /?id-
ham-ma/, or, orthographically, PeSI. When
followed by a suffix beginning with a conso-
nant, as in dhamX+tu, the three-consonant
cluster would need to be broken up by another
epenthetic vowel as in /?id-ha-mam-tu/, or,
orthographically, However, However, for reasons
to become clearer below when we look at bilit-
eral roots, we defined an underlying Form IX
perfect active pattern CCaCaX leading to ab-
stract stems like dhamaX.
2.3 Other Cases of Final Radical
Gemination/Spreading
Other verb forms where the final radical is
copied include the rare Forms XI and XIV. Root
lhj ( r o j) intersects with the Form XI perfect
active pattern CCaaCaX to form the abstract
stem lhaajaX ( &amp;quot;curdle&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;coagulate&amp;quot;), leading
to surface forms like /7il-haaj-ja/ (LW) and
flil-haa-jaj-tu/ (L:4) that vary exactly
as in Form IX. The same holds for root shb
o ,p), which takes both Form IX (shabaX)
and Form XI (shaabaX), both meaning &amp;quot;be-
come reddish&amp;quot;. In our lexicon, one root qis
(„7, 3) takes form XIV, with patterns like the
perfect active CCanCaX and imperfect active
CCanCiX (-be pigeon-breasted&amp;quot;). Other sim-
ilar Form XIV examples probably exist but are
not reflected in the current dictionary.
Aside from the verbal nouns and partici-
ples of Forms IX, XI and XIV, other noun-like
patterns also involve the spreading of the fi-
nal radical. These include CiCCiiX and Ca-
CaaCiiX, taken by roots nhr c 3), mean-
ing &amp;quot;skilled/experienced&amp;quot;, and rid
meaning &amp;quot;coward/cowardly&amp;quot;. The CaCaaCiiX
pattern also serves as the broken (i.e. ir-
regular) plural for CuCCuuX stems for the
roots zir ( J) meaning &amp;quot;ill-tempered&amp;quot;, stir
c 00) meaning &amp;quot;thrush/blackbird&amp;quot;, lyd
J) meaning &amp;quot;chin&amp;quot;, and thr ( c 10) and
txr t_ .10), both meaning &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;. When an
X appears after a long vowel as in tuxruuX,
it is always realized as a full copy of the pre-
vious consonant as in /tuxruur/ ( J32,10), no
matter what follows.

Gemination/Spreading
Just as Forms II and V involve gemination of the
middle radical, other forms including Form XII
involve the separated spreading of the middle
radical. A preceding diphthong, like a preceding
long vowel, causes X to be realized as a full
copy of the preceding consonant, as shown in
the following examples.

3 Biliteral Roots
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994674375">
As pointed out in McCarthy (1981, p. 396-
7), the gemination vs. spreading behavior of
Form IX stems is closely paralleled by Form
I stems involving traditionally analyzed &amp;quot;bilit-
eral&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;geminating&amp;quot; roots such as tm (also
characterized as tmm) and sm (possibly smm)
and many others of the same ilk. As shown in
Figure 4, these roots show Form I gemination
with suffixes beginning with a vowel vs. full
spreading when the suffix begins with a conso-
nant. However Form IX is handled, these par-
allels strongly suggest that the exact same un-
derlying forms and variations rules should also
handle the form I of biliteral roots.
However, the Form I perfect active pattern,
in the current notation, is simply CaCaC (or

idence, for normal triliteral roots like ktb, that
any kind of copying is specified by the Form I
pattern itself.
Keeping CaCaC as the Form I perfect active
pattern, the behavior of biliteral roots falls out
effortlessly if they are formalized not as sm and
tm, nor as smm and tmm, but as smX and
tmX, with the copying-trigger X as the third
radical of the root itself. Such roots intersect
in the normal way with triliteral patterns as in

walter, 1990). Roots and patterns are inter-
sected (Beesley, 1998b) at compile time to yield
90,000 stems. Various combinations of prefixes
and suffixes, concatenated to the stems, yield
over 72,000,000 abstract words. Sixty-six finite-
state variation rules map these abstract strings
into fully-voweled orthographical strings, and
additional trivial rules are then applied to op-
tionally delete short vowels and other diacritics,
allowing the system to analyze unvoweled, par-
tially voweled, and fully-voweled orthographical
strings.
The full system, including a Java interface
that displays both input and output in Arabic
script, is available for testing on the Internet

<abstract confidence="0.996004888888889">This paper examines the phenomenon of consonant spreading in Arabic sterns. Each spreading involves a local surface copying of an underlying consonant, and, in certain phonological contexts, spreading alternates productively with consonant lengthening (or gemination). The morphophonemic triggers of spreading lie in the patterns or even in the roots themselves, and the combination of a spreading root and a spreading pattern causes a consonant to be copied multiple times. The interdigitation of Arabic stems and the realization of consonant spreading are formalized using finite-state morphotactics and variation rules, and this approach has been successfully implemented in a large-scale Arabic morphological analyzer which is available for testing on the Internet.</abstract>

Although the most accessible computer implementations (Koskenniemi, 1983; Antworth, 1990; Karttunen, 1993) of finite-state morphotactics have been limited to building words via the concatenation of morphemes, the theory itself does not have this limitation. In Semitic morphotactics, root and pattern morphemes (and, according to one&apos;s theory, perhaps separate vocalization morphemes) are naturally formalized as regular languages, and stems are formed by the intersection, rather than the concatenation, of these regular languages. Such analyses have been laid out elsewhere (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley, 1998a; Beesley, 1998b) and cannot be repeated here. For present purposes</context>

The current dictionaries contain 4930 roots, each one hand-coded to indicate the subset of patterns with which it legally combines (Buckwalter, 1990). Roots and patterns are intersected (Beesley, 1998b) at compile time to yield 90,000 stems. Various combinations of prefixes and suffixes, concatenated to the stems, yield over 72,000,000 abstract words. Sixty-six finitestate variation rules map these abstract strings into fully-voweled orthographical strings, and additional trivial rules are then applied to optionally delete short vowels and other diacritics, allowing the system to analyze unvoweled, partially voweled, and fully-voweled orthographical strings.

Keeping CaCaC as the Form I perfect active pattern, the behavior of biliteral roots falls out effortlessly if they are formalized not as sm and tm, nor as smm and tmm, but as smX and tmX, with the copying-trigger X as the third radical of the root itself. Such roots intersect in the normal way with triliteral patterns as in Figure 6, and they are mapped to appropriate surface strings using the same rules that realize Form IX stems. 4 Rules The TWOLC rule (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) that maps an X, coming either from roots like tmX or from patterns like Form IX CCaCaX. into a copy of the previous consonant is the following, where Cons is a grammar-level variable ranging freely over consonants, LongVowel is a grammar-level variable ranging freely over long vowels and diphthongs, and C is an indexed local variable ranging over the enumerated set of consonants.

In fact, both forms do occur in full surface words as shown in Figure 3, and the difference is productively and straightforwardly phonological. For perfect endings like +a (le&apos;) and +at (&apos;she&apos;), the final consonant is geminated (or &amp;quot;lengthened&amp;quot;, depending on your formal point of view).

McCarthy (1981) and others (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994; Bird and Blackburn, 1991) postulate an underlying Form IX stem for dhm that looks like dhamam, with a spreading of the final m radical; other writers like Beeston (1968) list the stem as dhamm, with a geminated or lengthened final radical. In fact, both forms do occur in full surface words as shown in Figure 3, and the difference is productively and straightforwardly phonological. For perfect endings like +a (le&apos;) and +at (&apos;she&apos;), the final consonant is geminated (or &amp;quot;lengthened&amp;quot;, depending on your formal point of view). If, however, the suffix begins with </context>

While not especially common, there are more roots that take middle-radical-spreading noun patterns than take the better-known Form IX verb patterns. 3 Biliteral Roots As pointed out in McCarthy (1981, p. 396- 7), the gemination vs. spreading behavior of Form IX stems is closely paralleled by Form I stems involving traditionally analyzed &amp;quot;biliteral&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;geminating&amp;quot; roots such as tm (also characterized as tmm) and sm (possibly smm) and many others of the same ilk. As shown in Figure 4, these roots show Form I gemination with suffixes beginning with a vowel vs. full spreading when the suffix begins with a consonant. However Form IX is handled, these parallels strongly suggest that the exact same underlying forms and variations rules should also handle the form I of biliteral roots. However, </context>
