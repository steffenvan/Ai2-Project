Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934117647059">
A method for mapping linguistic descrip-
tions in plain XML into semantically rich
RDF/OWL is outlined and demonstrated.
Starting with Simons’s (2003) original
proof of concept of this method, we extend
his Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL)
for creating metaschemas to carry out the
mapping, employ the General Ontology for
Linguistic Description (GOLD) of Farrar
and Langendoen (2003) as the target se-
mantic schema, and make use of SeRQL,
an RDF-aware search engine. This data
migration effort is in keeping with the vi-
sion of a Semantic Web; it is part of an ef-
fort to build a ‘community of practice’
around semantically rich linguistic re-
sources.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892257142857">
Machine-readable structured linguistic docu-
ments (comparative word lists, lexicons, annotated
texts, audio and audio-video recordings aligned
with transcriptions (possibly annotated), gram-
matical descriptions, etc.) are being made available
in a wide variety of formats on the Web. Until re-
cently, the linguistics community has not been par-
ticularly concerned about the ease with which
those structures can be accessed by other users, nor
about the comparability of the structures that can
be accessed. Now that community is beginning to
realize that XML encoding provides relatively
straightforward access to the intended structures
and at the same time insures that the documents
will continue be accessible for the foreseeable fu-
ture.
However, XML encoding by itself does not in-
sure comparability. To achieve that goal, the com-
munity must either adopt standards for encoding
particular structures, or methods need to be devel-
oped for interpreting structures that are differently
encoded. This paper reports on an effort to do the
latter: to migrate XML documentation of linguistic
structure to a semantically interoperable format.
One of the most compelling reasons to do so is to
enable intelligent search: the ability to query
documents based on their semantics, rather than on
strings of characters that may occur in them or on
their document syntax. Facilitating intelligent
searching is also one of the major goals of the Se-
mantic Web. We are making the first steps towards
a Semantic Web for linguistics by showing how to
migrate a significant amount of language resources
to a format that makes them semantically compa-
rable.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997805625">
The work reported in this paper was carried out
as part of the Electronic Metastructure for Endan-
gered Language Data (EMELD) project
[emeld.org] (NSF grant 0094934) and the Data-
Driven Linguistic Ontology project (NSF grant
0411348). One of the objectives of the EMELD
project is the “formulation and promulgation of
best practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexi-
con.” Underlying this objective is the goal of en-
suring that the digital language documentation
produced by linguists will be truly portable in the
sense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will tran-
scend computer environments, scholarly communi-
ties, domains of application, and the passage of
time. The project was undertaken on the basis of
the following principles:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9899888">
1. XML markup provides the best format for
the interchange and archiving of endangered
language description and documentation.
2. No single schema or set of schemas for
XML markup can be imposed on all lan-
guage resources.
3. The resources must nevertheless be compa-
rable for searching, drawing inferences, etc.
Simons (2003) points out the conflict between
the second and third principles, and describes the
following set of actions for reconciling them.
1. Develop a community consensus on shared
ontologies of linguistic concepts that can
serve as the basis for interoperation.
2. Define the semantics of any particular
markup schema by mapping its elements and
attributes to the concepts in the shared on-
tology that they represent.
3. Map each individual language resource onto
its (partial) semantic interpretation by apply-
ing the mapping of its markup schema.
4. Perform queries and other knowledge-based
operations across resources over these se-
mantic interpretations rather than the origi-
nal XML documents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.940507371428571">
The EMELD project has already begun work on
the first of these action items, the creation of a
sharable ontology for language documentation and
description, a General Ontology for Linguistic De-
scription (GOLD) [emeld.org/gold] (Farrar and
Langendoen, 2003), which is intended to be
grounded in a suitable upper ontology such as
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or DOLCE (Ma-
solo et al., 2002). GOLD is itself being written in
OWL, the Ontology Web Language (McGuinness
and van Harmelen, 2004), for use in Semantic Web
applications. Simons (2003, 2004) also provides a
‘proof of concept’ for an implementation of the
remaining three action items as follows.
1. Beginning with three dictionaries that used
similar but distinct markup based on the
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines
(Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002),
Simons created mappings from their differ-
ent markup schemas to a common semantics
as defined by an RDF Schema (Brickley and
Guha, 2004). Such a semantic schema pro-
vides a “formal definition ... of the concepts
in a particular domain, including types of re-
sources that exist, the properties that can re-
late pairs of resources, and the properties
that can describe a single resource in terms
of literal values” (Simons, 2004). This map-
ping he called a metaschema, a formal defi-
nition of how the elements and attributes of
a markup schema are to be interpreted in
terms of the concepts of the semantic
schema. He called the ‘language’ for writing
metaschemas (defined via an XML DTD) a
Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989463666666667">
2. Simons performed the semantic interpreta-
tion operation in a two-step process using
XSLT, first to create an interpreter for a par-
ticular metaschema and then to apply it
against a source document to yield the RDF
document (repository) that is its semantic in-
terpretation.
3. Simons then loaded the RDF repositories
into a Prolog system to create a merged da-
tabase of RDF triples and used Prolog’s in-
ference engine to query the semantic inter-
pretations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998860344827586">
Simons (2003) describes this implementation as
providing a semantics of markup, rather than as
devising yet another markup language for seman-
tics. As such, it is in the spirit of efforts such as
Sperberg-McQueen et al. (2000), who define the
meaning of markup as the set of inferences li-
censed by it. However, their model does not pro-
vide for the general comparison of documents. It is
also in the spirit of the proposal for a Linguistic
Annotation Framework (LAF) under development
by Working Group 1-1 of ISO TC 37 SC 4
[www.tc37sc4.org] (Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide,
Romary and de la Clergerie, 2003), but differs
from it in some significant ways. For example, our
strategy does not require that the source annota-
tions be mapped to an XML ‘pivot format’. On the
other hand, the LAF does not require that the
source annotations be in XML to begin with. The
‘data categories’ of the LAF correspond to the
concepts in GOLD; however the “creation of an
ontology of annotation classes and types” is not yet
part of the LAF (Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie
2003). Moreover, the LAF data model is confined
to feature structures, whereas GOLD plans to offer
feature structures as one of several data structuring
alternatives. Finally, through its connection with
an upper ontology, GOLD will also be related to
the ‘rest of the world’, whereas the LAF ontology
is apparently intended for linguistic structure only.

3 Goals of this paper
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990319">
In this paper we extend Simons’ proof of con-
cept for the use of metaschemas in the following
ways.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.939162666666667">
1. GOLD itself is used as the semantic schema.
2. SIL is extended to include the ability to map
the content of designated elements and at-
tributes in source documents to the semantic
schema, not just the markup itself.
3. We devise metaschemas for lexicons that
use distinct XML markup schemas: one of
the lexicons that Simons (2003) originally
used, for Sikaiana (Solomon Islands) with

about 3000 entries; a Hopi (Arizona) dic-
tionary with about 30,000 entries, for which
Kenneth Hill’s original encoding using a
proprietary and no longer supported data-
base program was converted to XML by
Lewis and Gonzalez; and a Potawatomi
(Great Lakes region, US and Canada) lexi-
con being created by Laura Buszard-
Welcher using the EMELD FIELD tool.
4. The Prolog query engine is replaced by
SeRQL, an SQL-like query language for
Sesame, an RDF database program (Broek-
stra, Kampman and van Harmelen 2002;
User Guide for Sesame 2004). It is our in-
tention to couple Sesame with an inference
engine that reads OWL documents, such as
Racer (Haarslev and Moller 2001).
In carrying out the migration of such language
resources to the Semantic Web, we are guided by
the principle of preserving the original analyses as
much as possible. At the same time, since the mi-
grated resources are to be rendered mutually inter-
operable and transparent to the tools that are de-
signed to work over them, the migration process
has the potential to greatly increase the precision
of the original analyses, to reveal inconsistencies
in them, and ultimately to result in enriched re-
sources. For example, the comparison of two de-
scriptions of the same language that has been made
possible by migration could reveal errors in one or
the other. Similarly, a single resource could be
checked for consistency with accumulated linguis-
tic knowledge represented in an ontology. The mi-
gration process thus provides two sources of new
knowledge. First is the knowledge brought in from
the document interpretation process itself, i.e. by
the linguist, not necessarily the one who performed
the original analysis. Second when the migrated
documents are added to the knowledge base, new
inferences can be automatically generated based on
the general knowledge of linguistics captured in
the ontology. The type of new knowledge gener-
ated is however constrained, for example, by the
type of search to be done over the resulting knowl-
edge base (see section 6).
However the migration process can also skew or
misinterpret the intentions underlying the original
documentation. To minimize this risk, the migra-
tion tools should be as non-intrusive as possible.
Even so, some steps are necessary to add structure
where structure is lacking in the original XML
documentation and to interpret the meaning of the
original elements where their meanings are unde-
fined or unclear. For the ontology the implication
is that theory-laden concepts either should be
avoided or less encumbered alternatives should be
made available.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983571428572">
An important guiding principle used in the con-
struction of GOLD is to distinguish between those
concepts that represent the content of linguistic
data and those that pertain to the structuring of
those data (cf. Ide and Romary 2003 who also dis-
tinguish between data content and data structure).
A particular entry in a lexicon, for example, is a
data structure used to organize lexical data in a
particular fashion. Entries usually contain actual
data instances, e.g., the Hopi word nahalayvi’yma
or its phonological properties. The process of data
migration is made much easier if a separation be-
tween data and data structure is upheld in the se-
mantic schema.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998159">
4.1 Data content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945523809524">
Linguistic data content includes linguistic ex-
pressions, the physical manifestations of language,
also known as ‘morphs’, or simply ‘forms’, which
may be written, spoken or signed. In GOLD, writ-
ten linguistic expressions are represented as
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION with the subclasses
ORTHOGRAPHICPART, ORTHOGRAPHICWORD, and
ORTHOGRAPHICSENTENCE. These are defined as
special types of strings. In order to analyze linguis-
tic data further, abstract counterparts of linguistic
expressions are proposed called LINGUISTICUNIT.
The abstract units are the main objects of interest
in formal linguistics. In some theories, the various
subclasses of LINGUISTICUNIT correspond to
‘morphemes’, ‘constituents’, or ‘constructions’. No
assumptions are made about whether these have
any mental significance, e.g. whether they are un-
derlying forms. The class hierarchy for
LINGUISTICUNIT is presented in Farrar, Lewis and
Langendoen (2002), and can be viewed in GOLD
using Protégé 2.0 [protege.stanford.edu].
The LINGUISTICUNIT hierarchy is organized ac-
cording to how its components are realized as
forms, and not according to their formal linguistic
features, which are theory specific. So, for exam-
ple, LEXICALUNIT is simply a formal unit that can
appear in isolation in its realized form, and not
necessarily something that can be a constituent of
larger syntactic constructions. The methodology
leaves open the question of whether, for example,
a SUBLEXICALUNIT can also be a phrasal constitu-
ent, as appears to be the case with CLITIC. Yet an-
other alternative would be to organize LINGUISTIC-
UNIT according to semantic features, e.g., a
SUBLEXICALUNIT would be something which usu-
ally represents a grammaticized notion. But, since
this varies from language to language, a different
taxonomy would be needed for every type of lan-
guage encountered. To sum up, adhering to strictly
formal features necessitates theory-specific tax-
onomies, while adhering to semantic features leads
to language-specific taxonomies. Instead a neutral
approach is taken in which LINGUISTICUNIT is or-
ganized according to how instances are realized as
linguistic expressions.
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION is related to LIN-
GUISTICUNIT by the predicate REALIZES. The par-
ticular sort of LINGUISTICUNIT is further defined
according to what kinds of attributes it can take.
So, a MORPHOSYNTACTICUNIT has attributes of
the sort MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE. Instances
of particular attributes are PASTTENSE, SINGULAR-
NUMBER, and PROGRESSIVEASPECT. The class of
attributes pertaining to linguistic units parallels
other kinds of non-linguistic attributes such as
SHAPEATTRIBUTE and PHYSICALSTATE.
There are several varieties of attributes which
linguists find useful for language description, in-
cluding phonological and semantic features. Se-
mantic attributes contrast with morphosyntactic
attributes in that the former correspond to the no-
tional characteristics of linguistic form that have
some manifestation in the grammar.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992011">
4.2 Data structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969436363637">
A linguistic data structure is defined as an ab-
stract information container which provides a way
to package elements of linguistic data. The two
main types of data structures contained in GOLD
at the moment are LEXICALITEM and FEATURE-
STRUCTURE. Our characterization of LEXICALITEM
extends that of Bell and Bird (2000). At a mini-
mum, a LEXICALITEM should contain an instance
of LEXICALUNIT or of SUBLEXICALUNIT. Special
relations are given in GOLD which pertain only to
data structures, e.g., HASLEXICALUNIT relates a
LEXICALITEM to a LEXICALUNIT. Instances of
LEXICALITEM typically include glosses either in
the same language in the case of a monolingual
lexicon, or in some other language in the case of a
bilingual lexicon. Glosses are simply instances of
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION related to the entry
via the relation GLOSS. Entries relate to one an-
other via relations such as SYNONYMOF and
ANTONYMOF.
If a LEXICALITEM contains extensive morpho-
logical information, we may represent this in the
form of a FEATURESTRUCTURE. The FEATURE-
STRUCTURE class is part of a more extensive set of
data structures known as a FEATURESYSTEM (Lan-
gendoen and Simons, 1995; Maxwell, Simons and
Hayashi, 2002). A FEATURESPECIFICATION is a
data structure that contains a subclass and an in-
stance of MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE (i.e. an
ordered pair), for example, [TENSE: PASTTENSE].
The implementation of the FEATURESYSTEM con-
struct allows for recursive FEATURESPECIFICA-
TIONs in which, for example, a subclass of
MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE is paired with an
instance of FEATURESTRUCTURE.
One criticism that could be raised against the in-
clusion of data structures in a semantic resource
such as GOLD is that they are superfluous. Why
not simply leave it up to the source markup to de-
scribe the elements of data structure, e.g., in the
form of an XML Schema? This is certainly a rea-
sonable criticism, since excluding data structures
from GOLD would make the ontological model-
ling process much simpler. However, they are in-
cluded because we envision that subsequent appli-
cations will need to be able to reason, not only
about the data itself, but also about how it is struc-
tured. For example, it might be necessary to com-
pare elements of a LEXICALITEM to that of
FEATURESTRUCTURE. This is actually an essential
step in achieving the vision of the Semantic Web,
namely, constraining the source data in such a way
as to preserve structure where structure is defined
and to enrich structure where structure is left un-
specified.

5 Semantic Interpretation Language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99702212">
The Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) was
originally created to define the meaning of the
elements and attributes declared in an XML
markup schema, as well as the relationships be-
tween them. An SIL metaschema is an XML
document that formally maps the elements and
attributes of an XML encoded resource to concepts
in an OWL ontology or an RDF Schema. Further-
more, the metaschema formally interprets the
original markup structure by declaring what the
dominance and linking relations in the XML
document structure represent. For example, con-
sider the extract from the Hopi lexicon shown in
Figure 1.
The dominance relation between the elements
&lt;MSI&gt; (for ‘morphosyntactic information’) and
&lt;POS&gt; (for ‘part of speech’) in the original XML
is implicitly something like ‘has’. This can be
made more explicit by mapping it to HAS-
MORPHOSYNTACTICPROPERTY, a formally defined
relation in the ontology. This relation is formally
defined in the ontology by specifying its signature,
i.e. what kinds of arguments it can take. Thus, a
better defined, more exact, relationship between
elements of markup is achieved.

SIL has been extended to formalize the resolu-
tion of content in addition to markup. For example,
the semantics of the gram vt in the XML structure
&lt;POS&gt;vt&lt;/POS&gt; can be specified via a mapping
to the ontology as an instance of VERB-
TRANSITIVE, in addition to defining the semantics
of the POS element itself.
An SIL metaschema, as described in detail in
Simons (2004), is an XML document built from
metaschema directives, which are essentially proc-
essing instructions expressed as XML elements.
Directives like resource, property, lit-
eral and translate generate elements of the
resulting semantic interpretation. Part of the SIL
DTD is shown in Figure 2.

Of primary importance to the interpretation of

interpreted as referencing a morphosyntactic prop-
erty, the value of which is content interpretable by
the terminology set identified by the reference
Hopi/Hopi_pos_mapping.xml. A terminol-
ogy set contains a simple mapping between terms
used in the source document and the names of the
equivalent concepts in the ontology. SIL can han-
dle both one-to-one terminology mappings (e.g.,
mapping from the tag vt to the concept VERB-
TRANSITIVE) as well as one-to-many mappings
(e.g. mapping from 1sg to a property bundle of
FIRSTPERSON and SINGULARNUMBER).

SIL is designed to allow interoperability be-

The SIL only guarantees interoperability when

the mapping. If an entire group relies on a common
semantic schema, e.g. GOLD, a ‘community of
practice’ is formed. This in turn facilitates intelli-
gent search across converted resources.
Currently, writing an SIL metaschema is done
entirely by hand. We are in the process, however,
of developing two tools to automate the process.
The first tool will allow the user to define the rela-
tionship between the terminology used within a
resource with relevant GOLD concepts. The sec-
ond tool will define the structural mapping rela-
tionship between the resource and a given meta-
structure. The first tool, named Alchemy, presents
the user with a drag-and-drop interface in which
the user defines the terms used within her resource
by associating them with one or more GOLD con-
cepts. The relationship between any given term
and relevant GOLD concepts can be complex, with
one-to-one or one-to-many relationships being al-
lowed, and the relationships themselves can be of
any of a number of types: SameAs, KindOf, etc.
We are in the process of building this tool, embed-
ded within an systems developer toolkit accompa-
nying GOLD.
The second as of yet unnamed tool is still in the
early design stages. This tool will allow the user to
first define the type of resource she is converting
(lexicon, interlinear text, grammar, etc.), and will
then lead her through a series of questions that de-
fine the structure by associating it with a meta-type
definition for the particular resource type. The tool
will require a precise and well-defined ‘semantics
of linguistic structure’, a conceptual space of lin-
guistic structural types that will be included in
GOLD, but is still in the process of being defined.
The final output of this tool, in association with an
Alchemy-defined terminology set, will be an SIL
metaschema.

6 Querying Resources

In this section, we discuss the general issue of
searching over linguistic descriptions on the Web,
and the current state of our effort to do so using
SeRQL (see section 3 item 4) over the RDF reposi-
tories for Sikaiana, Hopi and Potawatomi gener-
ated by the metaschemas from their XML-encoded
lexicons.

6.1 Dimensions of search over linguistic de-
scriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99333075">
As mentioned in section 1 above, one of the
most compelling reasons to migrate XML docu-
mentation to a semantically interoperable format is
to enable intelligent search. For the linguistics
community, we envision several parameters of
search over semantically interoperable linguistic
documentation. Search may be performed accord-
ing to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963668625">
• level of analysis (phonetic, morphosyntactic,
discourse)
• typological dimension (including language
type)
• intent of search (for exploring some particu-
lar language, or for language comparison)
• kind of results desired (which data structure
to return)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763222222222">
Search also varies according to degree of diffi-
culty, that is, whether search requires the assis-
tance of an inferencing engine or not. Direct
search is defined as search over explicitly repre-
sented data, i.e. instance data in the knowledge
space. This includes the simple string matching of
conventional search engines. But since the search
will be carried out using the enriched RDF frame-
work, direct search is not limited to string match-
ing in the original XML. An example of direct
search is to find all data that includes a reference to
instances of some grammatical category (e.g.,
PASTTENSE). Boolean searching with direct search
is also possible, e.g., searching for cases of port-
manteau morphemes, expressed in our framework
as two or more MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTES
associated with some LINGUISTICUNIT.
Indirect search goes beyond direct search by
making use of inferences based on the structuring
of the concepts in an ontology. For example the
concept of PLURALNUMBER means ‘two or more’,
the concept of DUALNUMBER means ‘exactly two’,
and the concept of MULTALNUMBER means ‘three
or more’. A direct search for PLURALNUMBER will
miss those instances represented as DUALNUMBER
and MULTALNUMBER, whereas an indirect search
will find them.

In Figure 6, we give the SeRQL query (omitting

for all the lexical items specified as having the
GOLD concept PROGRESSIVEASPECT in the three
lexicons. This query returned 1135 results, all from
Hopi.

Potawatomi; an example for each language is

More complex queries that take advantage of the
structure of the ontology are also possible, for ex-
ample to find all the verbs in the lexicons regard-
less of whether they have been tagged as transitive
verbs, intransitive verbs, or simply as verbs. With
further development of the method described here,
much more elaborate queries over much larger lin-
guistic data repositories will be possible. This re-
sult, we hope, will encourage much more wide-
spread distribution of language resources on the
Web and the creation of a large community of
practice that uses those resources for research,
teaching, and language revitalization efforts.

The two main types of data structures contained in GOLD at the moment are LEXICALITEM and FEATURESTRUCTURE. Our characterization of LEXICALITEM extends that of Bell and Bird (2000). At a minimum, a LEXICALITEM should contain an instance of LEXICALUNIT or of SUBLEXICALUNIT. Special relations are given in GOLD which pertain only to data structures, e.g., HASLEXICALUNIT relates a LEXICALITEM to a LEXICALUNIT. Instances of LEXICALITEM typically include glosses either in the same language in the case of a monolingual lexicon, or in some other language in the case of a bilingual lexicon. Glosses are simply instances of ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION related to the entry via the relation GLOSS. Entries relate to one another via relations such as SYNONYMOF and ANTONYMOF.

One of the objectives of the EMELD project is the “formulation and promulgation of best practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexicon.” Underlying this objective is the goal of ensuring that the digital language documentation produced by linguists will be truly portable in the sense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will transcend computer environments, scholarly communities, domains of application, and the passage of time. The project was undertaken on the basis of the following principles: 1. XML markup provides the best format for the interchange and archiving of endangered language description and documentation. 2. No single schema or set of schemas for XML markup can be imposed on all language resources. 3. The resources must nevertheless be comparable for searching, drawing inferences, etc. Simons (2003) points out the conflict between the second and third principles, and describes the fol</context>

Until recently, the linguistics commun</context>

Map each individual language resource onto its (partial) semantic interpretation by applying the mapping of its markup schema. 4. Perform queries and other knowledge-based operations across resources over these semantic interpretations rather than the original XML documents. The EMELD project has already begun work on the first of these action items, the creation of a sharable ontology for language documentation and description, a General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD) [emeld.org/gold] (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003), which is intended to be grounded in a suitable upper ontology such as SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or DOLCE (Masolo et al., 2002). GOLD is itself being written in OWL, the Ontology Web Language (McGuinness and van Harmelen, 2004), for use in Semantic Web applications.

The Prolog query engine is replaced by SeRQL, an SQL-like query language for Sesame, an RDF database program (Broekstra, Kampman and van Harmelen 2002; User Guide for Sesame 2004). It is our intention to couple Sesame with an inference engine that reads OWL documents, such as Racer (Haarslev and Moller 2001). In carrying out the migration of such language resources to the Semantic Web, we are guided by the principle of preserving the original analyses as much as possible. At the same time, since the migrated resources are to be rendered mutually interoperable and transparent to the tools that are designed to work over them, the migration process has the potential to greatly increase the precision of the original analyses, to reveal inconsistencies in them, and ultimately to result in enriched resources.

Simons (2003) describes this implementation as providing a semantics of markup, rather than as devising yet another markup language for semantics. As such, it is in the spirit of efforts such as Sperberg-McQueen et al. (2000), who define the meaning of markup as the set of inferences licensed by it. However, their model does not provide for the general comparison of documents. It is also in the spirit of the proposal for a Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) under development by Working Group 1-1 of ISO TC 37 SC 4 [www.tc37sc4.org] (Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie, 2003), but differs from it in some significant ways. For example, our strategy does not require that the source annotations be mapped to an XML ‘pivot format’. On the other hand, the LAF does not require that the source annotations be in XML to begin with. The ‘data categories’ of the LAF correspond to the concepts in GOLD; however the “creation of an ontology of annotation classes and types” is not yet part of the LAF (Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie 2003). Moreover, the LAF data model is confined to feature structures, whereas GOLD plans to offer feature st</context>

Even so, some steps are necessary to add structure where structure is lacking in the original XML documentation and to interpret the meaning of the original elements where their meanings are undefined or unclear. For the ontology the implication is that theory-laden concepts either should be avoided or less encumbered alternatives should be made available. 4 GOLD An important guiding principle used in the construction of GOLD is to distinguish between those concepts that represent the content of linguistic data and those that pertain to the structuring of those data (cf. Ide and Romary 2003 who also distinguish between data content and data structure). A particular entry in a lexicon, for example, is a data structure used to organize lexical data in a particular fashion. Entries usually contain actual data instances, e.g., the Hopi word nahalayvi’yma or its phonological properties. The process of data migration is made much easier if a separation between data and data structure is upheld in the semantic schema. 4.1 Data content Linguistic data content includes linguistic expressions, the physical manifestations of language, also known as ‘morphs’, or simply ‘forms’, which may be</context>

Instances of LEXICALITEM typically include glosses either in the same language in the case of a monolingual lexicon, or in some other language in the case of a bilingual lexicon. Glosses are simply instances of ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION related to the entry via the relation GLOSS. Entries relate to one another via relations such as SYNONYMOF and ANTONYMOF. If a LEXICALITEM contains extensive morphological information, we may represent this in the form of a FEATURESTRUCTURE. The FEATURESTRUCTURE class is part of a more extensive set of data structures known as a FEATURESYSTEM (Langendoen and Simons, 1995; Maxwell, Simons and Hayashi, 2002). A FEATURESPECIFICATION is a data structure that contains a subclass and an instance of MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE (i.e. an ordered pair), for example, [TENSE: PASTTENSE]. The implementation of the FEATURESYSTEM construct allows for recursive FEATURESPECIFICATIONs in which, for example, a subclass of MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE is paired with an instance of FEATURESTRUCTURE. One criticism that could be raised against the inclusion of data structures in a semantic resource such as GOLD is that they are superfluous.

One of the objectives of the EMELD project is the “formulation and promulgation of best practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexicon.” Underlying this objective is the goal of ensuring that the digital language documentation produced by linguists will be truly portable in the sense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will transcend computer environments, scholarly communities, domains of application, and the passage of time. The project was undertaken on the basis of the following principles: 1. XML markup provides the best format for the interchange and archiving of endangered language description and documentation. 2. No single schema or set of schemas for XML markup can be imposed on all language resources. 3. The resources must nevertheless be comparable for searching, drawing inferences, etc. Simons (2003) points out the conflict between the second and third principles, and describes the fol</context>

He called the ‘language’ for writing metaschemas (defined via an XML DTD) a Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL). 2.

GOLD itself is used as the semantic schema. 2. SIL is extended to include the ability to map the content of designated elements and attributes in source documents to the semantic schema, not just the markup itself. 3. We devise metaschemas for lexicons that use distinct XML markup schemas: one of the lexicons that Simons (2003) originally used, for Sikaiana (Solomon Islands) with about 3000 entries; a Hopi (Arizona) dictionary with about 30,000 entries, for which Kenneth Hill’s original encoding using a proprietary and no longer supported database program was converted to XML by Lewis and Gonzalez; and a Potawatomi (Great Lakes region, US and Canada) lexicon being created by Laura BuszardWelcher using the EMELD FIELD tool. 4.

Extract from Hopi Lexicon SIL has been extended to formalize the resolution of content in addition to markup. For example, the semantics of the gram vt in the XML structure &lt;POS&gt;vt&lt;/POS&gt; can be specified via a mapping to the ontology as an instance of VERBTRANSITIVE, in addition to defining the semantics of the POS element itself. An SIL metaschema, as described in detail in Simons (2004), is an XML document built from metaschema directives, which are essentially processing instructions expressed as XML elements. Directives like resource, property, literal and translate generate elements of the resulting semantic interpretation. Part of the SIL DTD is shown in Figure 2. &lt;!ELEMENT metaschema (namespace+, (interpret |ignore)+)&gt; &lt;!ELEMENT namespace (#PCDATA)&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST namespace prefix CDATA #REQUIRED&gt; &lt;!ELEMENT interpret (resource | translate |property | literal)*&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST interpret markup CDATA #REQUIRED&gt; &lt;!ELEMENT resource (property | translate |literal |embed)*&gt; &lt;!ATTLIST r</context>
