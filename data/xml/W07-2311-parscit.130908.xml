Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973583333333">
This paper describes a model of the choice of
modal verbs and modal particles. The choice
mechanism does not require a modality-specific
input as, e.g., a modal logical formula. Instead
semantic (modal force) and pragmatic
constraints (speech act marking) are applied to
the available information on the whole and
constrain the set of modal candidates to those
that are appropriate in the respective contexts.
The choice model is realized in the CAN system
that generates recommendations about courses
of study.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605826086957">
Modality is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Speakers
use modals very frequently to express that a
state of affairs is not simply true or false, but
that the propositional content of the respective
sentence must be evaluated against some
background information. For example, a
sentence like she must study computer science
expresses that, given some contextual
information, it follows necessarily from this
information that she studies computer science.
Pragmatically, in the same context, the use of
the modal verb must is able to signal the
existence of a certain speech act, for example an
advice.
Such an estimation of the validity of a
proposition against contextual restrictions and
signalling a speech act at the same time is rather
the rule than the exception so that it is not
surprising that modality concerns all relevant
processing levels in NLG.
If we take the standard division of labour for an
NLG system (cf. Reiter and Dale 2000),
basically each module affects modality:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.883254962962963">
• Trivially, content selection is a
modality-related task since a decision
must be drawn which content shall be
modalized.
• Discourse structuring may be modality-
sensitive for two reasons: first, some
rhetorical relations suggest the use of
modals within their arguments,1 and
second, if information is grouped, this
chunk might serve as conversational
background triggering the use of
modals.
• Since sentence connectives can bear
modal meanings (Blilhdorn 2004),
sentence aggregation is modality-
sensitive as well.
• Modals are no content words, but they
are polysemous lexical items and
candidates for lexical choice.
• Even the generation of referring
expressions is sensitive to modality
because pronouns behave differently in
certain modal contexts (a phenomenon
labelled in formal semantics as modal
subordination, see Roberts 1989).
• Finally, the grammatical realization
requires modal-specific grammar rules.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999530888888889">
Although modality is anything but a peripheral
phenomenon, it did not receive much attention
in research on NLG yet. This is even more
astonishing if one considers generated texts
produced by NLG systems. Many systems
generate texts with modals, but the use of these
modals is not driven by semantic decisions. For
example, the STOP system (Reiter et al. 2003)
generates letters which contain modal verbs

and/or conditionals (whose meaning is closely
linked to modality) as, e.g., However, you might
like to be a non-smoker if it was easy to stop.
The question-answering system described in
Moriceau (2006) uses web page extracts in
addition to the generated answer. These extracts
contain modal expressions (e.g., it could also be
explained by random movements).
ADVISOR II (Elhadad 1995) is a generation
system that covers exactly the same domain as
the CAN system described in this paper. Its
generated sentences contain modal verbs (e.g.,
You have little experience with writing papers.
5o it could be difficult.), and it realizes several
of the speech acts that play a role in CAN as
well. However, since ADVISOR II is based on a
theory of argumentation that focuses on scalars
and lexical items with a scalar semantics,
respectively, the choice of modals is not driven
by the underlying theory. Lexical choice
concerns primarily scalar adjectives,
connectives, and judgement determiners.
In general, the papers on the mentioned systems
suggest that the use of these modal expressions
is not based on a meaningful representation of
modality or processes that systematically result
in the use of appropriate modal expressions.
Rather these systems seem to realize modals by
means of template-based approaches. A
semantically or pragmatically motivated choice
does not occur.

1.1 Aim of this paper
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939833333333">
In this paper, we present such a model of the
choice of modals. This model is integrated into
the CAN system (conceptualization for modal
expressions), an NLG system that generates
recommendations for courses of study
(Klabunde 2007). Currently, the choice of
modals is confined to modal verbs like können
(can) or müssen (must) and modal particles (ja,
doch; these particles have no direct counterparts
in English). The model does not require a
content representation as formulas of some
modal logic. The only concession to modality is
the existence of more than one content plan. We
operate with ordinary content plans created by a
planner, and simulate the semantics of modal
operators by means of quantification.
Additionally, we formulate pragmatic conditions
as speech act markers. The combination of
semantic with pragmatically motivated
conditions allows the selection of modal verbs
and particles, respectively.
In what follows, we will first describe the
semantic and pragmatic particularities of modal
verbs and particles and some relevant analyses
of these modals in formal semantics and
pragmatics (section 2). Based on these
approaches, we present the CAN system in
section 3. The choice of modals in CAN is
described in detail in section 4. We conclude this
paper with an outline of our future work.

2 Modal verbs and particles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999671375">
Modality is a blurred concept that centers around
the notions of possibility and necessity (cf.
Kratzer 1981; Papafragou 2006, Werner 2006,
and many others). Independent of what modal
expression is used, a modal sentence expresses
that the propositional content of the sentence
possibly or necessarily holds with respect to
some contextual restrictions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993752">
2.1 Modal verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996162875">
Standard approaches to the semantics of modal
verbs emphasize the relevance of two
parameters for a semantic analysis: the modal
force, i.e. the expression of possibility or
necessity, and contextual restrictions by means
of a conversational background. Some German
examples shall demonstrate the relevance of
these parameters:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.900330733333333">
(1) Du musst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen
You must attend the semantics course
Modal force: necessity
No restriction on the conversational
background
(2) Du sollst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen
You are to attend the semantics course
Modal force: necessity
Preferably a teleological, deontic or
epistemic conversational background
(3) Du darfst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen
You may attend the semantics course
Modal force: possibility
Preferably a deontic conversational
background
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997417666666667">
Meaning differences between modal verbs are
explained by different admissible modal forces
and conversational backgrounds. For example,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991943">
74
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992655">
the difference between müssen and sollen is just
the class of admissible backgrounds: both
express necessity as modal force, but while
müssen is not confined to specific conversational
backgrounds, sollen requires a teleological, a
deontic, or an epistemic background.
In Kratzer’s (1981) seminal work – inspired by
modal logics - propositions and conversational
backgrounds are represented as sets of possible
worlds, so that the whole approach boils down to
set-theoretic operations on possible world sets.
For our approach it is especially important that
the semantics of the modal operators ❑
(necessity) and 0 (possibility) is traced back to
universal and existential quantification over
possible worlds, respectively: if [p] denotes the
set of possible worlds, where the proposition p
holds, and R(w) is the set of accessible possible
worlds for a given world w, then: [❑(p)] _ kw.
(R(w) c [p]), and [0(p)] _ kw. (R(w) n [p] #
0).
For example, the sentence you must attend the
semantics course is true iff, given an actual
world w, all worlds that are accessible from w
belong to the set of worlds in which the
addressee attends the semantics course.
Although truth-conditions do not play an
essential role for the choice of modals, modal
forces do. We describe in section 4 how modal
forces are modelled by quantification over plan
nodes.
In addition to semantic constraints, modal verbs
may also serve as speech act markers (cf. Zeevat
2003). Many modal verbs are associated with
preferred conversational backgrounds, and this
background suggests a certain speech act. For
example, dürfen (may) expresses possibility as
modal force and can be used if a deontic
background becomes relevant. With such a
background, dürfen expresses a permission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999758">
2.2 Modal particles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.927672833333333">
Contrary to modal verbs, modal particles do not
have a semantics at all; their function is to relate
the propositional content to the speech situation.
For example, ja as modal particle indicates the
speaker’s evidence that the propositional content
is true:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.572486">
(4) Du besuchst ja den 5emantik-Kurs
</listItem>
<construct confidence="0.71737625">
You are attending the semantic course – as
we both know
Stressed doch marks a contradiction with the
listener‘s assumptions or - with normal
intonation - that the content is probably present
in the common ground:
(5) Du besuchst DOCH/doch den 5emantik-
Kurs
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.994886151515152">
You are attending the semantics course – I
am right/ am I right?
The particles always express possibility as
modal force, since the speaker signals that
according to his belief state it is not definitely
the case that the propositional content is true.
Furthermore, the particles are typically used
with an epistemic conversational background.
Zeevat (2004) points out that particles function
as context- and speech act markers. As context
markers, they signal the existence of a specific
relation between the common ground CG and
proposition �. For example, the particle ja
signals the relation old(CG, �).
As for speech act marking, the modal particles
behave analogous to modal verbs. The pragmatic
function of the particles is to map the default
speech act – the assertion - to a non-default one
as, e.g., a reminder or a recommendation. If the
particles function as speech act markers, their
meaning may be represented as planning
operators (cf. Appelt 1985 for an axiomatic
approach to speech act planning). In this case,
context marking belongs to the preconditions,
and using the particle has certain effects with
respect to the speaker’s goal and the listener’s
information state.
In choosing modal particles we benefit from the
vicinity of the formal characteristics of modal
particles to planning operators. As described in
section 4.2, we formulate speech acts as
operator-like rules that manipulate the common
ground.

3 The CAN system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.81666">
The CAN system supports students in choosing
courses for their course of study within the B.A.
program at the University of Bochum. The users
provide the system with the courses they
attended so far, the maximal number of
semesters they would like to study, and the
courses they want to attend. Based on this
information, the system generates
recommendations/pieces of advice etc. which
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994624">
75
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998186">
courses the user should/must/can/may take. The
architecture of the system is given in figure 1.
Content determination and linearization is
realized by a forward planner. The planner
produces a sequence of plans that are all of equal
value. More than one plan is needed in order to
have alternative scenarios as “possible worlds”
at hand, which is a prerequisite for the use of
any modal expression.
Since students have to major in two independent
areas, plans can contain conflicts. For example,
it could be the case that the user selects two
courses that take place at the same time. In these
cases the existence of the conflict will be
linguistically indicated and the conflict must be
resolved. Conflicts are resolved either by
considering the internal hierarchy of the course
types (obligatory courses are ranked higher than
optional ones), or – if both courses are of equal
value – by the user.

The modals are chosen by considering semantic
and pragmatic constraints as described in section
4.
Currently, the system is able to choose the
following modal expressions: müssen (must),
können (can), wollen (want), dürfen (may), nicht
brauchen (does not need to), the subjunctive
sollten (should), and the particles ja and doch.
The sentences are realized by means of
sentential templates with slots for the courses,
semesters, and modal expressions.

4 The choice of modals in CAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999658">
The basic idea in the choice of modals is to use
semantic and pragmatic constraints as filters for
all modal candidates.
The conversational background fixes those
modals that can be used at all. Based on this
initial set, the computed modal force restricts the
initial set to those modals that express that force.
Finally, we check whether the speech acts
associated with the remaining modals are
appropriate in the respective context.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994299">
4.1 Semantic constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999748484848485">
The conversational background is constituted by
the application domain. Since the knowledge
base contains information about the conditions
of study, we are primarily dealing with deontic
uses of the modals. The user’s input as well as
the information provided so far are stored in a
discourse model that constitutes an epistemic
background.2
The modal force is computed by quantification
over plan nodes. Basically, the content planner
works in a STRIPS-like fashion (Fikes et al.
1972). In order to achieve a definition of modal
forces in planning terms, it might be useful to
remind some definitions:
A plan Tc = (α1, ..., αn) is a sequence of tasks αi.
A plan graph G is a set of plans which have the
same starting node and the same final node: G =
{Tc1, ..., Tcm} such that b&apos;Tci: α1, αn E Tci.
We use a simplified version of operator
definitions that does without a delete list of
items to be removed from the current state
description: an operator is a pair (P,E) with P
being a formula as precondition and E a set of
formulas that describes the effects of the action.
States are modified just by extending the current
state by the effects of an instance of an operator:
Mi = Mi-1 v E. A plan Tc = (α1, ..., αn) will be
2 We should note that our approach is actually too
simple to treat all epistemic uses. Epistemic
interpretations express the speaker’s estimation of the
probability that a state of affairs comes true; we are
just able to check whether some information was
already given or is assumed to be new for the user.

accepted if all tasks αi are applicable in the
corresponding states: Mi-1 |- Pαi
Given these standard definitions, the conditions
for the modal forces are as follows:

0(αj) iff 37Li E G: Mαj-1 |- Pαj
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996036">
4.2 Pragmatic constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990625">
Our formulation of pragmatic constraints is
based on Zeevat‘s (2003, 2004) work on speech
act marking. Basically, Zeevat describes speech
act markers (focus markers, modal particles, and
others) as planning operators with preconditions
and effects. Three speech acts and their
constraints shall demonstrate how speech act
marking works in our approach.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.548957">
4.2.1 Permissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775">
Generally, a permission expresses that the
addressee‘s goal is compatible with the goals of
the speaker. Preconditions for realizing this
speech act are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.784117">
• The speaker is socially superordinate to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.67378525">
the listener. We believe that this
essential condition is satisfied due to the
user’s acceptance of CAN as a
supporting system.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.870093">
• The propositional content of the
sentence is compatible with the plan
graph.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999158928571429">
Context marking is not necessary. The system
checks whether the user‘s favoured courses {c1,
..., cn} can be mapped onto at least one of the
generated plans: 37Li: b&apos;cj: cj E 7Li.
If these conditions are satisfied, the modal verb
dürfen (may) is used since (1) it is an admissible
modal verb for the underlying deontic
background, (2) it expresses possibility as modal
force, i.e. the mentioned compatibility of the
conversational background with the
propositional content (the user’s courses), and –
due to the first condition mentioned above - it
may be used as illocutionary indicator of
permissions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.817376">
4.2.2 Reminders
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997410434782609">
Reminders draw on the discourse record as
epistemic conversational background. The
preconditions concern context marking: the
content must already be suggested in the
conversational background.
We are able to adopt Zeevat‘s (2004:102)
characterisation who takes the relation old as
context marker:
old(CG,�) iff CG |= suggested(�), and
suggested is defined by means of a set of
operators {O1, .., On} like x dreams that, x
believes that etc.: suggested(φ) H � v O1
suggested(φ) v ... v On suggested(�).
Since we are not dealing with attitude contexts,
our approach is a scaled-down version of
Zeevat’s proposal. The system checks whether
the proposition had been inserted into the
discourse record some time ago (in this case, CG
|= � is trivially satisfied). If this is the case, the
modal particle ja or doch is used because these
particles expresses possibility as modal force
(compatibility of the propositional content with
a plan) and signal the reminder.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986937">
4.2.3 Recommendations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955875">
Recommendations declare a certain state of
affairs as advantageous with respect to some
goal. Computationally, this is an optimization
problem: attending a course in a specific
semester is advantageous for the completion of
the course of study, if its attendance optimizes
the number of semesters for that completion.
If some course c becomes relevant – either it
was selected by the user or is given in the
knowledge base – the precondition is: 37Li, 7Lj
with c E 7Li, 7Lj and |7Li |&lt; |7Lj|.
If such an optimal attendance exists, the
subjunctive form sollte (should) is used. Sollte
expresses possibility, may be used for deontic
backgrounds, and is an illocutionary indicator of
recommendations.

the main clause (müssen, must). Wollen is used
because the user declares attending a course of

with at least one plan, viz. the plan that declares
such a course in the current semester. Since this
course must necessarily be attended to achieve
the user’s goal (every plan with the user’s goal

there is no plan containing the wanted course in
the respective semester (incompatibility of the
user’s input with the generated plans). For the
same reason, the preconditions of a permission
are not applicable. The particle has been chosen
because the user selected the same course some
time ago. The incompatibility is derived from
the discourse model so that the sentence is a
reminder on speech act level. The sentence also
explains why the course is incompatible with
each plan.

5 Summary and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979545454545">
The approach to the choice of modals described
in this paper does not require modal logic
formulas as content representations. However,
since the use of modals signals talking about
alternative scenarios/ worlds, one needs a way of
representing these alternatives. We solved this
problem by letting the planner create all possible
plans for the same initial and final state. This
bundle of equal plans allows us to determine the
modal force by means of quantifying plan nodes.
This semantic analysis restricts the set of modal
candidates to those items that are able to express
the determined modal force. A further
diminution of this set is achieved by considering
speech-act related conditions the modals must
satisfy.
Our future work comprises broadening the set of
modals (especially modal adverbs and syntactic
constructions with modal meanings), a more
elaborated treatment of modal forces, and the
evaluation of the system’s behaviour.
Thus far we treat modal forces from a traditional
viewpoint: there are two forces and nothing in
between. However, there are several linguistic
means to signal different degrees of modal
forces (various modal adverbs, the subjunctive,
and others). Quantifying over the plan nodes
should be a suitable means to model these
varying modal forces. Just as generalized
quantifiers express different relations between
two sets, we should be able to trace back the
modal forces to relations between all available
nodes and those that express propositional units.

<bodyText confidence="0.999993230769231">
Finally, we are planning to provide CAN with a
web interface in order to gain comments on the
linguistic adequacy of the generated modals.
Comments from students who played around
with the system seem to suggest that the modal
verbs are appropriate but the use of the modal
particles could be bemusing. The use of modal
particles seems to be deeply rooted in ordinary,
“real” conversation so that some students were
confused when CAN generates a sentence with a
chummy connotation. The evaluation shall
clarify whether the modals support the
acceptance of the expressed content.

<abstract confidence="0.998014576171875">This paper describes a model of the choice of modal verbs and modal particles. The choice mechanism does not require a modality-specific input as, e.g., a modal logical formula. Instead semantic (modal force) and pragmatic constraints (speech act marking) are applied to the available information on the whole and constrain the set of modal candidates to those that are appropriate in the respective contexts. choice model is realized in the that generates recommendations about courses of study. 1 Motivation Modality is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Speakers use modals very frequently to express that a state of affairs is not simply true or false, but that the propositional content of the respective sentence must be evaluated against some background information. For example, a like must study computer science expresses that, given some contextual information, it follows necessarily from this information that she studies computer science. Pragmatically, in the same context, the use of modal verb able to signal the existence of a certain speech act, for example an advice. Such an estimation of the validity of a proposition against contextual restrictions and signalling a speech act at the same time is rather the rule than the exception so that it is not surprising that modality concerns all relevant processing levels in NLG. If we take the standard division of labour for an NLG system (cf. Reiter and Dale 2000), basically each module affects modality: • Trivially, content selection is a modality-related task since a decision must be drawn which content shall be modalized. • Discourse structuring may be modalitysensitive for two reasons: first, some rhetorical relations suggest the use of within their and second, if information is grouped, this chunk might serve as conversational background triggering the use of modals. • Since sentence connectives can bear modal meanings (Blilhdorn 2004), sentence aggregation is modalitysensitive as well. • Modals are no content words, but they are polysemous lexical items and candidates for lexical choice. • Even the generation of referring expressions is sensitive to modality because pronouns behave differently in certain modal contexts (a phenomenon labelled in formal semantics as modal subordination, see Roberts 1989). • Finally, the grammatical realization requires modal-specific grammar rules. Although modality is anything but a peripheral phenomenon, it did not receive much attention in research on NLG yet. This is even more astonishing if one considers generated texts produced by NLG systems. Many systems generate texts with modals, but the use of these modals is not driven by semantic decisions. For the (Reiter et al. 2003) generates letters which contain modal verbs examples given on the RST website show this very clearly. 73 and/or conditionals (whose meaning is closely to modality) as, e.g., you like to be a non-smoker if it was easy to stop. The question-answering system described in Moriceau (2006) uses web page extracts in addition to the generated answer. These extracts modal expressions (e.g., be by random (Elhadad 1995) is a generation system that covers exactly the same domain as described in this paper. Its generated sentences contain modal verbs (e.g., You have little experience with writing papers. it and it realizes several the speech acts that play a role in However, since is based on a theory of argumentation that focuses on scalars and lexical items with a scalar semantics, respectively, the choice of modals is not driven by the underlying theory. Lexical choice concerns primarily scalar connectives, and judgement determiners. In general, the papers on the mentioned systems suggest that the use of these modal expressions is not based on a meaningful representation of modality or processes that systematically result in the use of appropriate modal expressions. Rather these systems seem to realize modals by means of template-based approaches. A semantically or pragmatically motivated choice does not occur. 1.1 Aim of this paper In this paper, we present such a model of the choice of modals. This model is integrated into for modal an NLG system that generates recommendations for courses of study (Klabunde 2007). Currently, the choice of is confined to modal verbs like or and modal particles particles have no direct counterparts in English). The model does not require a content representation as formulas of some modal logic. The only concession to modality is the existence of more than one content plan. We operate with ordinary content plans created by a planner, and simulate the semantics of modal operators by means of quantification. Additionally, we formulate pragmatic conditions as speech act markers. The combination of semantic with pragmatically motivated conditions allows the selection of modal verbs and particles, respectively. In what follows, we will first describe the semantic and pragmatic particularities of modal verbs and particles and some relevant analyses of these modals in formal semantics and pragmatics (section 2). Based on these we present the in 3. The choice of modals in described in detail in section 4. We conclude this paper with an outline of our future work. 2 Modal verbs and particles Modality is a blurred concept that centers around the notions of possibility and necessity (cf. Kratzer 1981; Papafragou 2006, Werner 2006, and many others). Independent of what modal expression is used, a modal sentence expresses that the propositional content of the sentence possibly or necessarily holds with respect to some contextual restrictions. 2.1 Modal verbs Standard approaches to the semantics of modal verbs emphasize the relevance of two for a semantic analysis: the i.e. the expression of possibility or necessity, and contextual restrictions by means a Some German examples shall demonstrate the relevance of these parameters: (1) Du musst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen You must attend the semantics course Modal force: necessity No restriction on the conversational background (2) Du sollst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen You are to attend the semantics course Modal force: necessity Preferably a teleological, deontic or epistemic conversational background (3) Du darfst den 5emantik-Kurs besuchen You may attend the semantics course Modal force: possibility Preferably a deontic conversational background Meaning differences between modal verbs are explained by different admissible modal forces and conversational backgrounds. For example, 74 difference between just the class of admissible backgrounds: both express necessity as modal force, but while not confined to specific conversational a teleological, a deontic, or an epistemic background. In Kratzer’s (1981) seminal work – inspired by modal logics propositions and conversational backgrounds are represented as sets of possible worlds, so that the whole approach boils down to set-theoretic operations on possible world sets. For our approach it is especially important that semantics of the modal operators and is traced back to universal and existential quantification over possible worlds, respectively: if [p] denotes the set of possible worlds, where the proposition p holds, and R(w) is the set of accessible possible for a given world w, then: _ and _ (R(w) example, the sentence must attend the course true iff, given an actual world w, all worlds that are accessible from w belong to the set of worlds in which the addressee attends the semantics course. Although truth-conditions do not play an essential role for the choice of modals, modal forces do. We describe in section 4 how modal forces are modelled by quantification over plan nodes. In addition to semantic constraints, modal verbs may also serve as speech act markers (cf. Zeevat 2003). Many modal verbs are associated with preferred conversational backgrounds, and this background suggests a certain speech act. For expresses possibility as modal force and can be used if a deontic background becomes relevant. With such a a permission. 2.2 Modal particles Contrary to modal verbs, modal particles do not have a semantics at all; their function is to relate the propositional content to the speech situation. example, modal particle indicates the speaker’s evidence that the propositional content is true: besuchst ja den 5emantik-Kurs You are attending the semantic course – as we both know a contradiction with the listener‘s assumptions or with normal intonation that the content is probably present in the common ground: besuchst DOCH/doch den 5emantik- Kurs You are attending the semantics course – I am right/ am I right? The particles always express possibility as modal force, since the speaker signals that according to his belief state it is not definitely the case that the propositional content is true. Furthermore, the particles are typically used with an epistemic conversational background. Zeevat (2004) points out that particles function as contextand speech act markers. As context markers, they signal the existence of a specific relation between the common ground CG and For example, the particle the relation As for speech act marking, the modal particles behave analogous to modal verbs. The pragmatic function of the particles is to map the default speech act – the assertion to a non-default one as, e.g., a reminder or a recommendation. If the particles function as speech act markers, their meaning may be represented as planning operators (cf. Appelt 1985 for an axiomatic approach to speech act planning). In this case, context marking belongs to the preconditions, and using the particle has certain effects with respect to the speaker’s goal and the listener’s information state. In choosing modal particles we benefit from the vicinity of the formal characteristics of modal particles to planning operators. As described in section 4.2, we formulate speech acts as operator-like rules that manipulate the common ground. The supports students in choosing courses for their course of study within the B.A. program at the University of Bochum. The users provide the system with the courses they attended so far, the maximal number of semesters they would like to study, and the courses they want to attend. Based on this information, the system recommendations/pieces of advice etc. which 75 courses the user should/must/can/may take. The architecture of the system is given in figure 1. Content determination and linearization is realized by a forward planner. The planner produces a sequence of plans that are all of equal value. More than one plan is needed in order to have alternative scenarios as “possible worlds” at hand, which is a prerequisite for the use of any modal expression. Since students have to major in two independent areas, plans can contain conflicts. For example, it could be the case that the user selects two courses that take place at the same time. In these cases the existence of the conflict will be linguistically indicated and the conflict must be resolved. Conflicts are resolved either by considering the internal hierarchy of the course types (obligatory courses are ranked higher than optional ones), or – if both courses are of equal value – by the user. modalized sentence 1: Architecture of The modals are chosen by considering semantic and pragmatic constraints as described in section 4. Currently, the system is able to choose the modal expressions: not need to), the subjunctive and the particles The sentences are realized by means of sentential templates with slots for the courses, semesters, and modal expressions. The choice of modals in The basic idea in the choice of modals is to use semantic and pragmatic constraints as filters for all modal candidates. The conversational background fixes those modals that can be used at all. Based on this initial set, the computed modal force restricts the initial set to those modals that express that force. Finally, we check whether the speech acts associated with the remaining modals are appropriate in the respective context. 4.1 Semantic constraints The conversational background is constituted by the application domain. Since the knowledge base contains information about the conditions of study, we are primarily dealing with deontic uses of the modals. The user’s input as well as the information provided so far are stored in a discourse model that constitutes an epistemic The modal force is computed by quantification over plan nodes. Basically, the content planner in a fashion (Fikes et al. 1972). In order to achieve a definition of modal forces in planning terms, it might be useful to remind some definitions: plan ..., a sequence of tasks A plan graph G is a set of plans which have the same starting node and the same final node: G = ..., such that E We use a simplified version of operator definitions that does without a delete list of items to be removed from the current state an operator is a pair P being a formula as precondition and E a set of formulas that describes the effects of the action. States are modified just by extending the current state by the effects of an instance of an operator: A plan ..., be should note that our approach is actually too simple to treat all epistemic uses. Epistemic interpretations express the speaker’s estimation of the probability that a state of affairs comes true; we are just able to check whether some information was already given or is assumed to be new for the user. User user input Conflict recognition &amp; verbalisation Path search module plans and conflicts Planner path Knowledge base Discourse model 76 if all tasks applicable in the states: |- Given these standard definitions, the conditions for the modal forces are as follows: ❑iff |iff |- 4.2 Pragmatic constraints Our formulation of pragmatic constraints is based on Zeevat‘s (2003, 2004) work on speech act marking. Basically, Zeevat describes speech act markers (focus markers, modal particles, and others) as planning operators with preconditions and effects. Three speech acts and their constraints shall demonstrate how speech act marking works in our approach. 4.2.1 Permissions Generally, a permission expresses that the addressee‘s goal is compatible with the goals of the speaker. Preconditions for realizing this speech act are: • The speaker is socially superordinate to the listener. We believe that this essential condition is satisfied due to the acceptance of a supporting system. • The propositional content of the sentence is compatible with the plan graph. Context marking is not necessary. The system whether the user‘s favoured courses can be mapped onto at least one of the plans: If these conditions are satisfied, the modal verb is used since (1) it is an admissible modal verb for the underlying deontic background, (2) it expresses possibility as modal force, i.e. the mentioned compatibility of the conversational background with the propositional content (the user’s courses), and – due to the first condition mentioned above it may be used as illocutionary indicator of permissions. 4.2.2 Reminders Reminders draw on the discourse record as epistemic conversational background. The preconditions concern context marking: the content must already be suggested in the conversational background. We are able to adopt Zeevat‘s (2004:102) who takes the relation context marker: iff CG |= and defined by means of a set of .., like dreams that, x that � v Since we are not dealing with attitude contexts, our approach is a scaled-down version of Zeevat’s proposal. The system checks whether the proposition had been inserted into the discourse record some time ago (in this case, CG trivially satisfied). If this is the case, the particle used because these particles expresses possibility as modal force (compatibility of the propositional content with a plan) and signal the reminder. 4.2.3 Recommendations Recommendations declare a certain state of affairs as advantageous with respect to some goal. Computationally, this is an optimization problem: attending a course in a specific semester is advantageous for the completion of the course of study, if its attendance optimizes the number of semesters for that completion. If some course c becomes relevant – either it was selected by the user or is given in the base – the precondition is: c &lt; If such an optimal attendance exists, the form is used. expresses possibility, may be used for deontic backgrounds, and is an illocutionary indicator of recommendations. 4.3 Example outputs The following three examples show the contextdependent choice of modals, depending on the user’s input, the information in the knowledge base, and the previous course of the interaction with the system. Note that the multiple occurrence of modals within one clause is possible: • The user selects a course of type „synchronic linguistics“: 77 Sie einen Kurs [Typ Synchronie] im Grundkursmodul „Germanistische Linguistik“ besuchen wollen, dann müssen Sie den Grundkurs Germanistische Linguistik, Teil 2 besuchen. If you want to attend a synchronic linguistics course in the basic module „Germanic Linguistics“, then you must attend part 2 of the basic course on Germanic Linguistics. The generated conditional sentence contains a verb in the if-clause want) and in main clause must). used because the user declares attending a course of some type as his goal. This goal is compatible with at least one plan, viz. the plan that declares such a course in the current semester. Since this course must necessarily be attended to achieve the user’s goal (every plan with the user’s goal final task contains this course), used. Speech act-related conditions are not relevant for this sentence. • The user selects the semantics course again, after some other course selections: dürfen doch dieses Semester den Kurs „Semantik“ nicht belegen, weil Sie nicht alle Voraussetzungen erfüllen. You must not attend the semantics course, because you do not satisfy all prerequisites – did you forget this? The generated sentence contains the negated verb and the modal particle The former is used because there is no plan containing the wanted course in the respective semester (incompatibility of the user’s input with the generated plans). For the same reason, the preconditions of a permission are not applicable. The particle has been chosen because the user selected the same course some time ago. The incompatibility is derived from the discourse model so that the sentence is a reminder on speech act level. The sentence also explains why the course is incompatible with each plan. • The user selects two courses with overlapping hours: wollen „Strukturen einer „Einführung in die Allerdings überschneiden sie sich zeitlich. Sie eine andere Auswahl You want to attend „Structures of a</abstract>

Kratzer 1981; Papafragou 2006, Werner 2006, and many others). Independent of what modal expression is used, a modal sentence expresses that the propositional content of the sentence possibly or necessarily holds with respect to some contextual restrictions. 2.1 Modal verbs Standard approaches to the semantics of modal verbs emphasize the relevance of two parameters for a semantic analysis: the modal force, i.e. the expression of possibility or necessity, and contextual restrictions by means of a conversational background.

Such an estimation of the validity of a proposition against contextual restrictions and signalling a speech act at the same time is rather the rule than the exception so that it is not surprising that modality concerns all relevant processing levels in NLG. If we take the standard division of labour for an NLG system (cf. Reiter and Dale 2000), basically each module affects modality: • Trivially, content selection is a modality-related task since a decision must be drawn which content shall be modalized. • Discourse structuring may be modalitysensitive for two reasons: first, some rhetorical relations suggest the use of modals within their arguments,1 and second, if information is grouped, this chunk might serve as conversational background triggering the use of modals. • Since sentence connectives can bear modal meanings (Blilhdorn 2004), sentence aggregation is modalitysensitive as well. • Modals are no content words, but they ar</context>

For example, the sentence you must attend the semantics course is true iff, given an actual world w, all worlds that are accessible from w belong to the set of worlds in which the addressee attends the semantics course. Although truth-conditions do not play an essential role for the choice of modals, modal forces do. We describe in section 4 how modal forces are modelled by quantification over plan nodes. In addition to semantic constraints, modal verbs may also serve as speech act markers (cf. Zeevat 2003). Many modal verbs are associated with preferred conversational backgrounds, and this background suggests a certain speech act. For example, dürfen (may) expresses possibility as modal force and can be used if a deontic background becomes relevant. With such a background, dürfen expresses a permission. 2.2 Modal particles Contrary to modal verbs, modal particles do not have a semantics at all; their function is to relate the propositional content to the speech situation. For example, ja as modal particle indicates the speaker’s evidence that the propositional content is true: (4) Du besuchst j</context>

The particles always express possibility as modal force, since the speaker signals that according to his belief state it is not definitely the case that the propositional content is true. Furthermore, the particles are typically used with an epistemic conversational background. Zeevat (2004) points out that particles function as context- and speech act markers. As context markers, they signal the existence of a specific relation between the common ground CG and proposition �. For example, the particle ja signals the relation old(CG, �). As for speech act marking, the modal particles behave analogous to modal verbs. The pragmatic function of the particles is to map the default speech act – the assertion - to a non-default one as, e.g., a reminder or a recommendation. If the particles function as speech act markers, their meaning may be represented as planning operators (cf. Appelt</context>
