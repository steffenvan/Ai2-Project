We present two recently released open-
source taggers: NameTag is a free soft-
ware for named entity recognition (NER)
which achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morpho-
logical Dictionary and Tagger) performs
morphological analysis (with lemmatiza-
tion), morphological generation, tagging
and tokenization with state-of-the-art re-
sults for Czech and a throughput around
10-200K words per second. The taggers
can be trained for any language for which
annotated data exist, but they are specifi-
cally designed to be efficient for inflective
languages, Both tools are free software
under LGPL license and are distributed
along with trained linguistic models which
are free for non-commercial use under the

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999913357142857">
Morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging
and named entity recognition are one of the most
important components of computational linguistic
applications. They usually represent initial steps
of language processing. It is no wonder then that
they have received a great deal of attention in the
computational linguistics community and in some
respect, these tasks can even be considered very
close to being “solved”.
However, despite the fact that there is a consid-
erable number of POS taggers available for En-
glish and other languages with a large number of
active users, we lacked a POS tagger and NE rec-
ognizer which would

• be well suited and trainable for languages
with very rich morphology and thus a large
tagset of possibly several thousand plausible
combinations of morphologically related at-
tribute values,
• provide excellent, preferably state-of-the-art
results for Czech,
• be distributed along with trained linguistic
models for Czech,
• allow the user to train custom models for any
language,
• be extremely efficient in terms of RAM and
disc usage to be used commercially,
• offer a full end-to-end solution for users with
little computational linguistics background,
• be distributed as a library without additional
dependencies,
• offer API in many programming languages,
• be open-source, free software.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998409888888889">
Following these requirements, we have devel-
oped a morphological dictionary and tagger soft-
ware, which is described and evaluated in Sec-
tion 3; and a named entity recognizer, which is de-
scribed and evaluated in Section 4. The software
performance and resource usage are described in
Section 5 and the release and licensing condition
information is given in Section 6. We conclude the
paper in Section 7.

In English, the task of POS tagging has been in
the center of computational linguists’ attention for
decades (Kucera and Francis, 1967), with renewed
interest after significant improvements achieved
by (Collins, 2002). The recent state-of-the-art for
English POS supervised tagging without external
data for training is by (Shen et al., 2007) and there
are many available taggers, such as well-known
Brill tagger (Brill, 1992), TnT tagger (Brants,
2000) and many others.

In Czech, the POS tagging research has been
carried out mostly by Czech speaking linguistic
community and the current state-of-the-art was re-
ported by (Spoustov´a et al., 2009) in Morˇce re-
search project1. Based on this project, two taggers
were released: Morˇce tagger (released as part of
COMPOST2 containing morphological analyzer,
tagger and trained models, available to registered

2.2 Named Entity Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995252">
For English, many NE datasets and shared tasks
exist, e.g. CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003), MUC7 (Chinchor, 1998).
These shared tasks and the associated freely avail-
able NE annotated corpora allowed wide and suc-
cessful research in NE recognition in English. For
example, the systems which published high scores
on the CoNLL-2003 task include (Suzuki and
Isozaki, 2008), (Ando and Zhang, 2005) and to our
knowledge, the best currently known results on
this dataset were published by (Ratinov and Roth,
2009). One should also mention a well-known and
widely used Stanford parser (Finkel et al., 2005).
In Czech, the referential corpus for NE recog-
nition is called the Czech Named Entity Corpus4
(ˇSevˇcikov´a et al., 2007) and we describe its’ prop-
erties further in Section 4.2. The development of
the Czech NE recognition research is easy to fol-
low: started by a pilot project by (ˇSevˇcikov´a et al.,
2007), the results were improved by (Kravalov´a
and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2009), (Konkol and Konop´ık,
2011) and (Konkol and Konopik, 2013). The cur-
rent state-of-the-art results for CNEC are reported
by (Strakov´a et al., 2013). So far, there was no
freely available Czech NE recognizer.

(suffixes) to mark linguistic cases, grammatical
number, gender etc. Therefore, many forms may
be related to one lemma. For example, the lemma
“zelen´y” (“green” in Czech) can appear as “ze-
len´y”, “zelenˇejˇsi”, “zelen´emu” etc. – there are
several tens of forms for this type of adjective.
Corpus-wise, there are 168K unique forms and
72K lemmas in a corpus of 2M words (Prague De-
pendency Treebank 2.5 (Bejˇcek et al., 2012)) in
Czech. It is therefore crucial to handle the end-
ings effectively and to reduce the processing costs
where regularities are found.
Given a resource with forms, lemmas and tags,6
MorphoDiTa estimates regular patterns based on
common form endings and automatically clusters
them into morphological “templates” without
linguistic knowledge about the language. We now
describe the method for template set creation.
During template set creation, MorphoDiTa
takes lemmas one by one. For each lemma, it
collects all corresponding forms and builds a trie
(De La Briandais, 1959; Knuth, 1997). Trie is a
tree structure in which one character corresponds
to a node and all descendants of a node share the
same prefix. The procedure then finds a suitable
common ancestor in the trie (common prefix or
stem). The heuristics is “such a node whose sub-
tree has depth at most N and at the same time has
the maximal number of ancestors with one child”.
Intuitively, this means we want to select a long
prefix (stem) – hence “maximal number of ances-
tors” but at the same time, the linguistic endings
are not too long (at most N). Having selected a
common prefix, all the endings (including their
corresponding tags) in its subtree define a tem-
plate. A rich trie with many subtrees may be split
into multiple templates. For example, a simple trie
for noun “hrad” (“castle” in Czech) with one tem-
plate, and also two lemmas sharing two templates
are shown in Fig. 1. When processing the next
lemma and its corresponding forms, either new
template is created, or the templates are reused if
the set of endings is the same. Larger N leads to
longer endings and larger number of classes, and
smaller N leads to short endings and less classes.7
Sometimes, the word “inflective” is used also for agglutina-
tive languages such as Turkish, Hungarian or Finnish; we be-
lieve our tools are suitable for these, too, but we have not
tested them on this group yet.

</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.999976675675676">
The number of templates determines the effi-
ciency of dictionary encoding. When too few tem-
plates are used, many are needed to represent a
lemma. When too many are used, the representa-
tion of the templates themselves is large.
The morphological dictionary is then saved in
binary form and the software offers a higher level
access: given a form, morphological analysis lists
all possible lemma-tag pairs; given a lemma-tag
pair, MorphoDiTa generates the respective form.
The analysis function is then used in tagging,
which we describe in the next section.
The heuristics described above does not require
linguistic knowledge about the language and han-
dles linguistic regularities very well. The major
advantage is a significant data compression lead-
ing to efficient resource usage: in our setting, the
original morphology dictionary, the Czech Morf-
flex, contains 120M form-tag pairs derived from
1M unique lemmas, using 3 922 different tags, of
total size 6.7GB.8 Using the proposed heuristics
with N = 8, there are 7 080 templates created,
such that the whole dictionary is encoded using
3M template instances. The resulting binary form
of the dictionary uses 2MB, which is 3 000 times
smaller than the original dictionary.
In order to look up a word form in the dictio-
nary, we split it into a prefix and an ending for
all ending lengths from 1 to N. We then find
templates associated with both the prefix and the
ending. For each such template, we return the
lemma corresponding to the prefix and the tag cor-
responding to the ending. The result is a set of
lemma-tag pairs found during this procedure. This
algorithm can be implemented efficiently – our
implementation performs 500k word form lookups
per second in the Czech morphological dictionary.

3.3 POS Tagger Evaluation

<bodyText confidence="0.980767692307692">
An evaluation of POS taggers, which do not use
external data, is shown in Table 1 for Czech and in
Table 2 for English. MorphoDiTa reaches state-of-
the-art results for Czech and nearly state-of-the-
art results for English. The results are very simi-
lar for the three Czech systems, Morˇce, Featurama
and MorphoDiTa, because in all three cases, they
are implementations of (Spoustov´a et al., 2009).
However, MorphoDiTa is the first end-to-end ap-
plication released under a free license.
Due to rich morphosyntactic complexity of the
Czech language and the positional tagging scheme
proposed by (Hajiˇc, 2004), there are 3 922 plausi-
ble tags in Czech (although only 1571 unique tags
actually appear in training data).
However, in many applications, only the first
two tagging positions, which correspond to POS
and sub-POS,9 are actually needed for further pro-
cessing, which greatly reduces the complexity of
the task, leaving only 67 possible tags (64 in train-
ing data), although some morphological informa-
tion, such as case, is lost.

basic properties such as the type of pronouns, conjunctions,
adjectives, also some tense and active/passive/mood informa-
tion for verbs, etc.

The NE recognizer is an implementation of a re-
search project by (Strakov´a et al., 2013). The rec-
ognizer is based on a Maximum Entropy Markov
Model. First, maximum entropy model predicts,
for each word in a sentence, the full probabil-
ity distribution of its classes and positions with
respect to an entity. Consequently, a global op-
timization via dynamic programming determines
the optimal combination of classes and named en-
tities chunks (lengths). The classification features
utilize morphological analysis, two-stage predic-
tion, word clustering and gazetteers and are de-
scribed in (Strakov´a et al., 2013).
The recognizer is available either as a run-time

Czech, or as a package which allows custom mod-
els to be trained using any NE-annotated data.

Czech Named Entity Corpus annotation allows
ambiguous labels, that is, one entity can be labeled
with two classes; however, NameTag predicts ex-

Furthermore, CNEC also allows embedded

NameTag always predicts only the outer-most en-

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983684210526">
We released two efficient, light-weight POS- and
NE taggers (especially efficient for inflective lan-
guages), which are available to a wide audience
as an open-source, free software with rich API
and also as an end-to-end application. The tag-
gers reach state-of-the-art results for Czech and
are distributed with the models. We are currently
working on more language releases (Slovak, Pol-
ish and Arabic). We are also aware that the cre-
ation of the dictionary relies on the existence of a
resource annotated with forms, lemmas and tags,
which may not be readily available. Therefore,
our future work includes developing a guesser for
analyzing previously unseen but valid word forms
in inflective languages, using only data annotated
with disambiguated POS tags. We hope the release
for Czech will prove useful for broad audience, for
example for shared tasks which include Czech lan-
guage data.

<abstract confidence="0.997630304347827">We present two recently released opensource taggers: NameTag is a free software for named entity recognition (NER) which achieves state-of-the-art performance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morphological Dictionary and Tagger) performs morphological analysis (with lemmatization), morphological generation, tagging and tokenization with state-of-the-art results for Czech and a throughput around 10-200K words per second. The taggers can be trained for any language for which annotated data exist, but they are specifically designed to be efficient for inflective languages, Both tools are free software under LGPL license and are distributed along with trained linguistic models which are free for non-commercial use under the CC BY-NC-SA license. The releases include standalone tools, C++ libraries with Java, Python and Perl bindings and web services.</abstract>

This algorithm can be implemented efficiently – our implementation performs 500k word form lookups per second in the Czech morphological dictionary. 3.2 POS Tagger Methodology The POS tagger is an offspring of Morˇce and Featurama research projects based on (Spoustov´a et al., 2009). For each form in the text, the morphological dictionary suggests all possible lemmatag candidates and these lemma-tag pairs are disambiguated by the tagger. The tagger is implemented as supervised, rich feature averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) and the classification features are adopted from (Spoustov´a et al., 2009). lemmas, because the process of minimization cannot capture templates containing word forms (or their prefixes) of multiple lemmas. 8Which compresses to 454MB using gzip -9.

It is therefore crucial to handle the endings effectively and to reduce the processing costs where regularities are found. Given a resource with forms, lemmas and tags,6 MorphoDiTa estimates regular patterns based on common form endings and automatically clusters them into morphological “templates” without linguistic knowledge about the language. We now describe the method for template set creation. During template set creation, MorphoDiTa takes lemmas one by one. For each lemma, it collects all corresponding forms and builds a trie (De La Briandais, 1959; Knuth, 1997). Trie is a tree structure in which one character corresponds to a node and all descendants of a node share the same prefix. The procedure then finds a suitable common ancestor in the trie (common prefix or stem). The heuristics is “such a node whose subtree has depth at most N and at the same time has the maximal number of ancestors with one child”. Intuitively, this means we want to select a long prefix (stem) – hence “maximal number of ancestors” but at the same time, the linguistic endings are not too long (at most N).

Czech language was trained on the training part of the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.5 (Bejˇcek et al., 2012). The English language was trained on the standard training portion (Sections 0-18) of the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). In both cases, the system was tuned on the development set (Sections 19-21 in PTB/WSJ in English) and tested on the testing section (Sections 22-24 in PTB/WSJ in English). 3.3 POS Tagger Evaluation An evaluation of POS taggers, which do not use external data, is shown in Table 1 for Czech and in Table 2 for English. MorphoDiTa reaches state-ofthe-art results for Czech and nearly state-of-theart results for English. The results are very similar for the three Czech systems, Morˇce, Featurama and MorphoDiTa, because in all three cases, they are implementations of (Spoustov´a et al., 2009). Howe</context>

These shared tasks and the associated freely available NE annotated corpora allowed wide and successful research in NE recognition in English. For example, the systems which published high scores on the CoNLL-2003 task include (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008), (Ando and Zhang, 2005) and to our knowledge, the best currently known results on this dataset were published by (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).
