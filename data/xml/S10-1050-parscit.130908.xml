<bodyText confidence="0.999938230769231">
This paper describes our approach to the
automatic identification of semantic rela-
tions between nominals in English sen-
tences. The basic idea of our strategy
is to develop machine-learning classifiers
which: (1) make use of class-independent
features and classifier; (2) make use of
a simple and effective feature set without
high computational cost; (3) make no use
of external annotated or unannotated cor-
pus at all. At SemEval 2010 Task 8 our
system achieved an F-measure of 75.43%
and a accuracy of 70.22%.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991034541666667">
Knowledge extraction of semantic relations be-
tween pairs of nominals from English text is one
important application both as an end in itself and
as an intermediate step in various downstream
NLP applications, such as information extraction,
summarization, machine translation, QA etc. It is
also useful for many auxiliary tasks such as word
sense disambiguation, language modeling, para-
phrasing and discourse relation processing.
In the past decade, semantic relation classifica-
tion has attracted a lot of interest from researchers
and a wide variety of relation classification
schemes exist in the literature. However, most
research work is quite different in definition of
relations and granularities of various applications.
That is, there is little agreement on relation
inventories. SemEval 2010 Task 8 (Hendrickx
et al., 2008) provides a new standard benchmark
for semantic relation classification to a wider
community, where it defines 9 relations includ-
ing CAUSE-EFFECT, COMPONENT-WHOLE,
CONTENT-CONTAINER, ENTITY-DESTINATION,
ENTITY-ORIGIN, INSTRUMENT-AGENCY,
MEMBER-COLLECTION, MESSAGE-TOPIC,
</bodyText>

PRODUCT-PRODUCER, and a tenth pseudo-
relation OTHER (where relation is not one of the
9 annotated relations).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8349125">
Unlike the previous semantic relation task in
SemEval 2007 Task 4, the current evaluation pro-
vides neither query pattern for each sentence nor
manually annotated word sense (in WordNet se-
mantic) for each nominals. Since its initiative is
to provide a more realistic real-world application
design that is practical, any classification system
must be usable without too much effort. It needs
to be easily computable. So we need to take into
account the following special considerations.
1. The extracted features for relation are ex-
pected to be easily computable. That is, the
steps in the feature extraction process are to
be simple and direct for the purpose of reduc-
ing errors possibly introduced by many NLP
tools. Furthermore, a unified (global) feature
set is set up for all relations rather than for
each relation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998965388888889">
2. Most previous work at SemEval 2007 Task
4 leveraged on external theauri or corpora
(whether unannotated or annotated) (Davi-
dov and Rappoport, 2008), (Costello, 2007),
(Beamer et al., 2007) and (Nakov and Hearst,
2008) that make the task adaption to different
domains and languages more difficult, since
they would not have such manually classified
or annotated corpus available. From a practi-
cal point of view, our system would make use
of less resources.
3. Most previous work at Semeval 2007 Task
4 constructed several local classifiers on dif-
ferent algorithms or different feature subsets,
one for each relation (Hendrickx et al., 2007)
and (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008). Our ap-
proach is to build a global classifier for all
relations in practical NLP settings.

Based on the above considerations, the idea of
our system is to make use of external resources as
less as possible. The purpose of this work is two-
fold. First, it provides an overview of our simple
and effective process for this task. Second, it com-
pares different features and classification strate-
gies for semantic relation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.936802">
2.1 Features Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932882352941">
For each training and test sentence, we reduce the
annotated target entities e1 and e2 to single nouns
noun1 and noun2, by keeping their last nouns only,
which we assume to be heads.
We create a global feature set for all relations.
The features extracted are of three types, i.e., lex-
ical, morpho-syntactic and semantic. The feature
set consists of the following 6 types of features.
Feature set 1: Lemma of target entities e1
and e2. The lemma of the entities annotated in
the given sentence.
Feature set 2: Stem and POS of words be-
tween e1 and e2. The stem and POS tag of the
words between two nominals. First all the words
between two nominals were extracted and then the
Porter’s stemming was performed to reduce words
to their base forms (Porter, 1980). Meanwhile,
OpenNLP postag tool was used to return part-of-
speech tagging for each word.
Feature set 3: syntactic pattern derived from
syntactic parser between e1 and e2. Typically,
the verb phrase or preposition phrase which con-
tain the nominals are important for relation clas-
sification. Therefore, OpenNLP Parser was per-
formed to do full syntactic parsing for each sen-
tence. Then for each nominal, we look for its par-
ent node in the syntactic tree until the parent node
is a verb phrase or preposition phrase. Then the
label of this phrase and the verb or preposition of
this phrase were extracted as the syntactic features.
Besides, we also extracted other 3 feature types
with the aid of WordNet.
Feature set 4: WordNet semantic class of e1
and e2. The WordNet semantic class of each an-
notated entity in the relation. If the nominal has
two and more words, then we examine the seman-
tic class of “w1 w2” in WordNet. If no result re-
turned from WordNet, we examine the semantic
class of head in the nominal. Since the cost of
manually WSD is expensive, the system simply
used the first (most frequent) noun senses for those
words.
Feature set 5: meronym-holonym relation
between e1 and e2. The meronym-holonym
relation between nominals. These information
are quite important for COMPONENT-WHOLE and
MEMBER-COLLECTION relations. WordNet3.0
provides meronym and holonym information for
some nouns. The features are extracted in the fol-
lowing steps. First, for nominal e1, we extract its
holonym from WN and for nominal e2, we extract
its Synonyms/Hypernyms. Then, the system will
check if there is same word between e1’s holonym
and e2’s synonym &amp; hypernym. The yes or no
result will be a binary feature. If yes, we also ex-
amine the type of this match is “part of” or “mem-
ber of” in holonym result. Then this type is also
a binary feature. After that, we exchange the posi-
tion of e1 and e2 and perform the same process-
ing. By creating these features, the system can
also take the direction of relations into account.
Feature set 6: hyponym-hypernym rela-
tion between nominal and the word of ”con-
tainer”. This feature is designed for CONTENT-
CONTAINER relation. For each nominal, WordNet
returns its hypernym set. Then the system examine
if the hypernym set contains the word “container”.
The result leads to a binary feature.

2.2 Classifier Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903947368421">
Our system is to build up a global classifier based
on global feature set for all 9 non-Other relations.
Generally, for this multi-class task, there are two
strategies for building classifier, which both con-
struct classifier on a global feature set. The first
scheme is to treat this multi-class task as an multi-
way classification. Since each pair of nominals
corresponds to one relation, i.e., single label clas-
sification, we build up a 10-way SVM classifier for
all 10 relations. Here, we call it multi-way clas-
sification. That is, the system will construct one
single global classifier which can classify 10 rela-
tions simultaneously in a run. The second scheme
is to split this multi-class task into multiple binary
classification tasks. Thus, we build 9 binary SVM
classifiers, one for each non-Other relation. Noted
that in both strategies the classifiers are built on
global feature set for all relations. For the sec-
ond multiple binary classification, we also exper-

imented on different prob. thresholds, i.e., 0.25
and 0.5. Furthermore, in order to reduce errors
and boost performance, we also adopt the major-
ity voting strategy to combine different classifiers.

3 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999942">
3.1 System Configurations and Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956">
The classifiers for all relations were optimized
independently in a number of 10-fold cross-
validation (CV) experiments on the provided train-
ing sets. The feature sets and learning algorithms
which were found to obtain the highest accuracies
for each relation were then used when applying the
classifiers to the unseen test data.
Table 1 summaries the 7 system configurations
we submitted and their performance on the test
data.
Among the above 7 system, SR5 system shows
the best macro-averaged F1 measure. Table 2 de-
scribes the statistics and performance obtained per
relation on the SR5 system.
Table 3 shows the performance of these 7 sys-
tems on the test data as a function of training set
size.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983149">
3.2 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976759259259">
The first three systems are based on three feature
sets, i.e.,F1-F3, with different classification strat-
egy. The next three systems are based on all six
feature sets with different classification strategy.
The last system adopts majority voting scheme on
the results of four systems, i.e., SR1, SR2, SR4
and SR5. Based on the above series of exper-
iments and results shown in the above 3 tables,
some interesting observations can be found as fol-
lows.
Obviously, although we did not perform WSD
on each nominal and only took the first noun sense
as semantic class, WordNet significantly improved
the performance. This result is consistent with
many previous work on Semeval 2007 Task 4 and
once again it shows that WordNet is important
for semantic relation classification. Specifically,
whether for multi-way classification or multiple
binary classification, the systems involved features
extracted from WordNet performed better than the
others not involved WN, for example, SR4 better
than SR1 (74.82% vs 60.08%), SR5 better than
SR2 (75.43% vs 72.59%), SR6 better than SR3
(72.19% vs 68.50%).
Generally, the performance of multiple binary
classifier is better than multi-way classifier. That
means, given a global feature set for 9 relations,
the performance of 9 binary classifiers is better
than a 10-way classifier. Specifically, when F1-F3
are involved, SR2 (72.59%) and SR3 (68.50%) are
both better than SR1 (60.08%). However, when
F1-F6 feature sets are involved, the performance
of SR4 is between that of SR5 and SR6 in terms of
macro-averaged F1 measure. With respect to ac-
curacy measure (Acc), SR4 system performs the
best.
Moreover, for multiple binary classification, the
threshold of probability has impact on the perfor-
mance. Generally, the system with prob. threshold
0.25 is better than that with 0.5, for example, SR2
better than SR3 (72.59% vs 68.50%), SR5 better
than SR6 (75.43% vs 72.19%).
As an ensemble system, SR7 combines the re-
sults of SR1, SR2, SR4 and SR5. However, this
majority voting strategy has not shown significant
improvements. The possible reason may be that
these classifiers come from a family of SVM clas-
sifiers and thus the random errors are not signifi-
cantly different.
Besides, one interesting observation is that SR4
system achieved the top 2 performance on TD1
data amongst all participating systems. This
shows that, even with less training data, SR4 sys-
tem achieves good performance.

Furthermore, a unified (global) feature set is set up for all relations rather than for each relation. 2.

The features extracted are of three types, i.e., lexical, morpho-syntactic and semantic. The feature set consists of the following 6 types of features. Feature set 1: Lemma of target entities e1 and e2. The lemma of the entities annotated in the given sentence. Feature set 2: Stem and POS of words between e1 and e2. The stem and POS tag of the words between two nominals. First all the words between two nominals were extracted and then the Porter’s stemming was performed to reduce words to their base forms (Porter, 1980). Meanwhile, OpenNLP postag tool was used to return part-ofspeech tagging for each word. Feature set 3: syntactic pattern derived from syntactic parser between e1 and e2. Typically, the verb phrase or preposition phrase which contain the nominals are important for relation classification. Therefore, OpenNLP Parser was performed to do full syntactic parsing for each sentence. Then for each nominal, we look for its parent node in the syntactic tree until the parent node is a verb phrase or preposition phrase. Then the label of this phrase and the verb or preposition of this phrase were extracted</context>
