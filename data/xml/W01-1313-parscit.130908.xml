Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999850625">
We describe a procedure for arranging into a
time-line the contents of news stories
describing the development of some situation.
We describe the parts of the system that deal
with 1. breaking sentences into event-clauses
and 2. resolving both explicit and implicit
temporal references. Evaluations show a
performance of 52%, compared to humans.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999859423076923">
Linguists who have analyzed news stories
(Schokkenbroek,1999; Bell,1997; Ohtsuka and
Brewer,1992, etc.) noticed that “narratives1 are
about more than one event and these events are
temporally ordered. Though it seems most
logical to recapitulate events in the order in
which they happened, i.e. in chronological order,
the events are often presented in a different
sequence”. The same paper states that “it is
important to reconstruct the underlying event
order2 for narrative analysis to assign meaning to
the sequence in which the events are narrated at
the level of discourse structure....If the
underlying event structure cannot be
reconstructed, it may well be impossible to
understand the narrative at all, let alone assign
meaning to its structure”.
Several psycholinguistic experiments show
the influence of event-arrangement in news
stories on the ease of comprehension by readers.
Duszak (1991) had readers reconstruct a news
story from the randomized sentences. According
to his experiments readers have a default strategy
by which—in the absence of cues to the
contrary—they re-impose chronological order on
events in the discourse.

The problem of reconstructing the
chronological order of events becomes more
complicated if we have to deal with separate
news stories, written at different times and
describing the development of some situation, as
is the case for multidocument summarization.
By judicious definition, one can make this
problem easy or hard. Selecting only specific
items to assign time-points to, and then
measuring correctness on them alone, may give
high performance but leave much of the text
unassigned. We address the problem of
assigning a time-point to every clause in the text.
Our approach is to break the news stories into
their constituent events and to assign time-
stamps—either time-points or time-intervals—to
these events. When assigning time-stamps we
analyze both implicit time references (mainly
through the tense system) and explicit ones
(temporal adverbials) such as ‘on Monday’, ‘in
1998’, etc. The result of the work is a prototype
program which takes as input set of news stories
broken into separate sentences and produces as
output a text that combines all the events from all
the articles, organized in chronological order.

2 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999335">
As data we used a set of news stories about an
earthquake in Afghanistan that occurred at the
end of May in 1998. These news stories were
taken from CNN, ABC, and APW websites for
the DUC-2000 meeting. The stories were all
written within one week. Some of the texts were
written on the same day. In addition to a
description of the May earthquake, these texts
contain references to another earthquake that
occurred in the same region in February 1998.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.992301" genericHeader="method">
3 Identifying Events
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904">
To divide sentences into event-clauses we use
CONTEX (Hermjakob, 1997), a parser that
produces a syntactic parse tree augmented with
semantic labels. CONTEX uses machine
learning techniques to induce a grammar from a
given treebanks. A sample output of CONTEX
is given in Appendix 1.
To divide a sentence into event-clauses the
parse tree output by CONTEX is analyzed from
left to right (root to leaf). The ::CAT field for
each node provides the necessary information
about whether the node under consideration
forms a part of its upper level event or whether it
introduces a new event. ::CAT features that
indicate new events are: S-CLAUSE, S-SNT, S-
SUB-CLAUSE, S-PART-CLAUSE, S-REL-
CLAUSE. These features mark clauses which
contain both subject (one or several NPs) and
predicate (VP containing one or several verbs).
The above procedure classifies a clause
containing more than one verb as a simple
clause. Such clauses are treated as one event and
only one time-point will be assigned to them.
This is fine when the second verb is used in the
same tense as the first, but may be wrong in
some cases, as in He lives in this house now and
will stay here for one more year. There are no
such clauses in the analyzed data, so we ignore
this complication for the present.
The parse tree also gives information about
the tense of verbs, used later for time assignment.
In order to facilitate subsequent processing,
we wish to rephrase relative clauses as full
independent sentences. We therefore have to
replace pronouns where it is possible by their
antecedents. Very often the parser gives
information about the referential antecedents (in
the example below, Russia). Therefore we
introduced the rule: if it is possible to identify
the referent, put it into the event-clause:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6857876">
1.Russia &lt;..&gt; said;
2.which &lt;Russia&gt; has loaned helicopters in
previous disasters;
3.it &lt;Russia&gt; would consider sending aid.
But sometimes the antecedent is identified
incorrectly.
Qulle charged that the United Nations and
non-governmental organizations involved
in the relief were poorly coordinated,
which was costing lives.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.987861285714286">
Here the antecedent for which is identified as the
relief, and gives which &lt;the relief&gt; was costing
lives instead of which &lt;poor coordination&gt; was
costing lives. Fortunately, in most cases our rule
works correctly.
Although the event-identifier works
reasonably well, breaking text into event-clauses
needs further investigation. Table 1 shows the
performance of the system. Two kinds of
mistakes are made by the event identifier: those
caused by CONTEX (it does not identify clauses
with omitted predicate, etc.) and those caused by
the fact that our clause identifier does too
shallow analysis of the parse tree.

4 Time-stamper
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995998">
According to (Bell, 1997) “time is expressed at
different levels—in the morphology and syntax of
the verb phrase, in time adverbials whether lexical
or phrasal, and in the discourse structure of the
stories above the sentence”.

symbol Ti is used as a comparative time-point if the
time the article was written is unknown. The
information in brackets gives the exact date the
article was written, which is the main anchor point
for the time-stamper. The information about hours,
minutes and seconds is ignored for the present.
2. Last time point assigned in the same sentence
While analyzing different event-clauses within the
same sentence we keep track of what time-point was
most recently assigned within this sentence. If
needed, we can refer to this time-point. In case the
most recent time information assigned is not a date
but an interval we record information about both
time boundaries. When the program proceeds to the
next sentence, the variable for the most recently
assigned date becomes undefined. In most cases this
assumption works correctly (example 5.2–5.3):
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.386453">
5.2.1 In the village of Kol, hundreds of people

5.2.2 that &lt;a United Nations helicopter&gt;
touched down three days after Saturday’s
earthquake
5.2.3 &lt;after Saturday’s earthquake&gt; struck a
remote mountainous area rocked three months
earlier by another massive quake
5.2.4 that &lt;another massive quake&gt; claimed
some 2,300 victims.
5.3.1 On Monday and Tuesday, U.N. helicopters
evacuated 50 of the most seriously injured to
emergency medical centers.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957388888889">
The last time interval assigned for sentence 5.2 is
{1998:53:0}---{1998:71:0}, which gives an
approximate range of days when the previous
earthquake happened. But the information in
sentence 5.3 is about the recent earthquake and not
about the previous one of 3 months earlier, which is
why it would be a mistake to point Monday and
Tuesday within that range.
Mani and Wilson (2000) point out “over half of
the errors [made by his time-stamper] were due to
propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time
to neighboring events”. The rule of dropping the
most recently assigned date as an anchor point when
proceeding to the next sentence very often helps us
to avoid this problem.
There are however cases where dropping the
most recent time as an anchor when proceeding to
the next sentence causes errors:

4.8.1 But in February a devastating earthquake

thousands of people homeless.

suffered through a logistical nightmare to reach
the snow-bound region with assistance.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997256">
It is clear that sentence 4.9 is the continuation of
sentence 4.8 and refers to the same time point
(February earthquake). In this case our rule assigns
the wrong time to 4.9.1. Still we retain this rule
because it is more frequently correct than incorrect.

4.3 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995247166666667">
First, the text divided into event-clauses is run
through a program that extracts all the date-stamps
(made available by Kevin Knight, ISI). In most
cases this program does not miss any date-stamps
and extracts only the correct ones. The only cases in
which it did not work properly for the texts were:

time (Merriam-Webster dictionary).
After extracting all the date-phrases we proceed
to time assignment.

4.4 Rules of Time Assignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981975">
When assigning a time to an event, we select the
time to be either the most recently assigned date or,
if the value of the most recently assigned date is
undefined, to the date of the article. We use a set of
rules to perform this selection. These rules can be
divided into two main categories: those that work
for sentences containing explicit date information,
and those that work for sentences that do not.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.878106333333333">
4.4.1 Assigning Time-Stamps to the Clauses
with Explicit Date Information
• Day of the Week
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745137931035">
If the day-of-the-week used in the event-
clause is the same as that of the article (or the
most recently assigned date, if it is defined), and
there no words before it could signal that the
described event happened earlier or will happen
later, then the time-point of the article (or the
most recently assigned date, if it is defined) is
assigned to this event. If before or after a day-of-
the-week there is a word/words signaling that the
event happened earlier of will happen later then
the time-point is assigned in accordance with this
signal-word and the most recently assigned date,
if it is defined.
If the day-of-the-week used in the event-
clause is not the same as that of the article (or the
most recently assigned date, if it is defined), then
if there are words pointing out that the event
happened before the article was written or the
tense used in the clause is past, then the time for
the event-clause is assigned in accordance with
this word (such words we call signal-words), or
the most recent day corresponding to the current
day-of-the-week is chosen. If the signal-word
points out that the event will happen after the
article was written or the tense used in the clause
is future, then the time for the event-clause is
assigned in accordance with the signal word or
the closest subsequent day corresponding to the
current day-of-the-week.

helicopters evacuated 50 of the most
seriously injured to emergency medical
centers.
The time for article 5 is (06/06/1998:Tuesday
15:17:00). So, the time assigned to this event-
clause is: 5.3.1 {1998:151:1}, {1998:152:2}.

The rules are the same as for a day-of-the-
week, but in this case a time-range is assigned to
the event-clause. The left boundary of the range
is the first day of the month, the right boundary
is the last day of the month, and though it is
possible to figure out the days of weeks for these
boundaries, this aspect is ignored for the present.

homeless.
The time for article 4 is (05/30/1998:Saturday
14:41:00). So, the time assigned to this event-
clause is 4.8.1 {1998:32:0}---{1998:60:0}.
In the analyzed corpus there is a case where
the presence of a name of month leads to a
wrong time-stamping:

<footnote confidence="0.8374204">
6.3.1 Estimates say
6.3.2 up to 5,000 people died from the May

<bodyText confidence="0.999449888888889">
Because of February, a wrong time-interval is
assigned to clause 6.3.3, namely {1998:32:0}---
{1998:60:0}. As this event-clause is a description
of the latest news as compared to some figures it
should have the time-point of the article. Such
cases present a good possibility for the use of
machine learning techniques to disambiguate
between the cases where we should take into
account date-phrase information and where not.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943049">
• Weeks, Days, Months, Years
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975115">
We might have date-stamps where the words
weeks, days, months, years are used with
modifiers. For example
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.914284">
5.2.1 In the village of Kol, hundreds of

5.2.2 that &lt;a United Nations helicopter&gt;

remote mountainous area rocked three
months earlier by another massive quake
5.2.4 that &lt;another massive quake&gt; claimed
some 2,300 victims.
In event-clause 5.2.3 the expression three months
earlier is used. It is clear that to get the time for
the event it is not enough to subtract 3 months
from the time of the article because the above
expression gives an approximate range within
which this event could happen and not a
particular date. For such cases we invented the
following rule:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.882395375">
Time=multiplier*length4; (in this case 3*30);
Day=DDD-Time; (for years Year=YYYY-Time)
Left boundary of the range=
Day-round (10%(Day));
(for years = Year - round(10%(Year)))
Right boundary of the range =
Day + round (10%(Day));
(for years = Year + round (10%(Year)))
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9792275">
For event 5.2.3 the time range will be
{1998:53:0)---{1998:71:0) (the exact date of the
article is {1998:152:2}).
If the modifier used with weeks, days, months
or years is several, then the multiplier used in (1)
is equal to 2.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966534">
• When, Since, After, Before, etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999327818181818">
If an event-clause does not contain any date-
phrase but contains one of the words ‘when’,
‘since’, ‘after’, ‘before’, etc., it might mean that
this clause refers to an event, the time of which
can be used as a reference point for the event
under analysis. In this case we ask the user to
insert the time for this reference event manually.
This rule can cause problems in cases where
‘after’ or ‘before’ are used not as temporal
connectors but as spatial ones, though in the
analyzed texts we did not face this problem.

• Other Tenses

<bodyText confidence="0.999784210526316">
Other tenses that can be identified with the
help of CONTEX are Present and Past
Indefinite. In the analyzed data all the verbs in
Present Indefinite are given the most recently
assigned date (or the date of the article). The
situation with Past Indefinite is much more
complicated and requires further investigation of
more data. News stories usually describe the
events that already took place at some time in the
past, which is why even if the day when the
event happened is not over, past tense is very
often used for the description (this is especially
noticeable for US news of European, Asian,
African and Australian events). This means that
very often an event-clause containing a verb in
Past Indefinite Tense can be assigned the most
recently assigned date (or the date of the article).
It might prove useful to use machine learned
rules for such cases.

4.5 Sources of Errors for Time-stamper
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992583333333">
We ran the time-stamper program on two
types of data: list of event-clauses extracted by
the event identifier and list of event-clauses
created manually. Tables 2 and 3 show the
results. In the former case we analyzed only the
correctly identified clauses. One can see that
even on manually created data the performance
of the time-stamper is not 100%. Why?
Some errors are caused by assigning the time
based on the date-phrase present in the event-
clause, when this date-phrase is not an adverbial
time modifier but an attribute. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9980996">
1. Estimates say
2. up to S,000 people died from the May 30
earthquake,
3. more than twice as many fatalities as in
the February disaster.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981420142857143">
The third event describes the May 30 earthquake
but the time interval given for this event is
{1998:32:0}---{1998:60:0} (i.e., the event
happened in February). It might be possible to
use machine learned rules to correct such cases.
One more significant source of errors is the
writing style:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9995165">
1. “When I left early this morning,
2. everything was fine.
3. After the earthquake, I came back,
4. and the house had collapsed.
S. I looked for two days and gave up.
6. Everybody gave up
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999470153846154">
When the reader sees early this morning he or
she tends to assign to this clause the time of the
article, but later as seeing looked for two days,
realizes that the time of the clause containing
early this morning is two days earlier than the
time of the article. It seems that the errors caused
by the writing style can hardly be avoided.
If an event happened at some time-point but
according to the information in the sentence we
can assign only a time-interval to this event (for
example, February Earthquake) then we say that
the time-interval is assigned correctly if the
necessary time-point is within this time-interval

5 Time-line for Several News Stories and its
Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967888888889">
After stamping all the news stories from the
analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from
all the articles into a chronological order. After
doing that we obtain a new set of event-clauses
which can easily be divided into two subsets–the
first one containing all the references to the
February earthquake, the second one containing
the list of event-clauses in chronological order,
describing what happened in May.
Such a text where all the events are organized
in a chronological order might be very helpful in
multidocument summarization, where it is
important to include into the final summary not
only the most important information but also the
most recent one. The output of the presented
system gives the information about the time-
order of the events described in several
documents.

Several linguistic and psycholinguistic studies
deal with the problem of time-arrangement of
different texts. The research presented in these
studies highlights many problems but does not
solve them.
As for computational applications of time
theories, most work was done on temporal
expressions that appear in scheduling dialogues
(Busemann et al., 1997; Alexandresson et al.,
1997). There are many constraints on temporal
expressions in this domain. The most relevant
prior work is (Mani and Wilson, 2000), who
implemented their system on news stories,
introduced rules spreading time-stamps obtained
with the help of explicit temporal expressions
throughout the whole article, and invented
machine learning rules for disambiguating
between specific and generic use of temporal
expressions (for example, whether Christmas is
used to denote the 25th of December or to denote
some period of time around the 25th of
December). They also mention a problem of
disambiguating between temporal expression and
proper name, as in ‘USA Today’.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998175611111111">
Bell (1997) notices “more research is needed
on the effects of time structure on news
comprehension. The hypothesis that the non-
canonical news format does adversely affect
understanding is a reasonable one on the basis of
comprehension research into other narrative
genres, but the degree to which familiarity with
news models may mitigate these problems is
unclear”. This research can greatly improve the
performance of time-stamper and might lead to a
list of machine learning rules for time detection.
In this paper we made an attempt to not just
analyze and decode temporal expressions but to
apply this analysis throughout the whole text and
assign time-stamps to such type of clauses,
which later could be used as separate sentences
in various natural language applications, for
example in multidocument summarization.

The last time interval assigned for sentence 5.2 is {1998:53:0}---{1998:71:0}, which gives an approximate range of days when the previous earthquake happened. But the information in sentence 5.3 is about the recent earthquake and not about the previous one of 3 months earlier, which is why it would be a mistake to point Monday and Tuesday within that range. Mani and Wilson (2000) point out “over half of the errors [made by his time-stamper] were due to propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time to neighboring events”. The rule of dropping the most recently assigned date as an anchor point when proceeding to the next sentence very often helps us to avoid this problem. There are however cases where dropping the most recent time as an anchor when proceeding to the next sentence causes errors: 4.8.1 But in February a devastating earthquake in the same region killed 2,300 people and left thousands of people homeless. 4.9.1 At the time international aid workers suf</context>

Several psycholinguistic experiments show the influence of event-arrangement in news stories on the ease of comprehension by readers. Duszak (1991) had readers reconstruct a news story from the randomized sentences. According to his experiments readers have a default strategy by which—in the absence of cues to the contrary—they re-impose chronological order on events in the discourse. 1 Schokkenbroek (1999) uses the term narrative for news stories that relate more than one event. 2 i.e., chronological order.
