The last decade has seen an explosion in the work done in the development of robust natural
language processing systems. A common methodology used in building these systems has been to
analyze a sample of the data available (either manually, or automatically for training statistical
systems), build statistical/heuristical schemas based upon the analysis, and test the system on a
blind sample of the data. Due to this commonly used paradigm, an important area of research that
has not been given the attention it deserves is the estimation of syntactic and semantic complexity
faced by these systems in the tasks they perform.
The Workshop on Syntactic and Semantic Complexity in Natural Language Processing Systems,
held on April 30th, 2000 at the Language Technology Joint Conference on Applied Natural Lan-
guage Processing and the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics
(ANLP-NAACL2000) was organized around the goals of discussing, promoting, and presenting new
research results regarding the question of complexity as it pertains to the syntax and semantics of
natural language. In particular, the goal of the workshop was to focus on:

<listItem confidence="0.999867">
• estimation of the syntactic and semantic complexity of specific NLP tasks
• semantic complexity and world knowledge
• role of syntactic and semantic complexity in system design and testing
• syntactic and semantic complexity and its role in the evaluation of NLP systems
• use of syntactic and semantic complexity as a performance predictor
• relationship between syntactic and semantic complexity

We would like to thank all authors who showed their interest by submitting papers to the
workshop. We would also like to thank the members of the program committee: Branirair Boguraev
(IBM Research), J-P Chanod (Xerox, Grenoble), Shalom Lappin (Kings College, London), Aravind
Joshi (University of Pennsylvania), Larry Moss (Indiana), Rohit Parikh (CUNY), and Adam Pease
