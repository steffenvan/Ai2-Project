This paper proposes a system of map-

instruments for automatic text under-
standing. The system illustrated in Japa-
nese consists of a set of verb classes and
information on mapping them together with
noun phrases, tense and aspect. The sys-

possible inferences between the verb
classes with information on tense and as-

I. INTRODUCTION

â€¢ The purpose of this paper is to pro-
pose a system of mapping classes of syn-
tactic structures as instruments for auto-
matic text understanding. The system con-
sists of a set of verb classes and infor-
mation on mapping them together with noun
Phrases. tense and aspect, and is supposed
to be utilized for inference in automatic
text understanding.
The language used for illustration of
the system is Japanese.
There is a tendency for non-syntactic
analysers and semantic grammars in auto-
matic text understanding. However, this
proposal is motivated by the fact that
syntactic structures. once analyzed and
classified in terms of semantic related-
ness, provide much information for under-
standing. This is supported by the fact
that human beings use syntactically re-
lated sentences when they ask questions
about texts.
The system we are proposing has the
following elements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975364333333333">
I) Verb classes.
2) Mapping of noun phrases between
or among some verb classes.
3) Direction of possible inference
between the classes with information on
tense and aspect.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998906909090909">
Our experiment, in which subjects are
asked to make true-false questions about
certain texts, revealed that native speak-
ers think that they understand texts by
deducting sentences lexically or semanti-
cally related. For instance, a human being
relates questions such as &apos;Did Mary go to
a theater?&apos; to a sentence in texts such as
&apos;John took Mary to a theater.&apos; Or, by the
same sentence, he understands that &apos;Mary
was in the theater.&apos;

II. FEATURES OF THE JAPANESE SYNTAX
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976158454545455">
Features of Japanese syntax relevant
to the discussion in this paper are pre-
sented below.
The sentence usually has case mark-
ings as postpositions to noun phrases. For
Instance.
I. John la Mary ni himitsu o hanashita
&apos;John told a secret to Mary.&apos;
In sentence I. postpositions ga. ni and
o indicate nominative, dative and accusa-
tive. respectively.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998503">
409
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992443">
However. postpositions do not unique-
ly map to deep cases. Take the following
sentences for example.
The two expressions, or viewpoints, on the
same phenomenon. that is, &apos;John showed to
Mary a book which she saw.&apos; are related
in Japanese by the verb root mi.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989989">
2. John wa santi n_i itta.
&apos;John went at 3 o&apos;clock.&apos;
3. John wa Tokyo nt itta.
&apos;John went to Tokyo.&apos;
4. John wa Tokyo pi_ sundeiru.
&apos;John lives in Tokyo.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983133">
Ni in the sentences 2, 3. 4 indicate time.
goal and location. respectively. This is
due to the verb category (3 and 4) or the
class of noun phrases (2 and 3) appearing
in each sentence.
Certain morpheme classes hide the
casemarking. e.g.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969707666666667">
5. John mo itta.
&apos;John also went (,-;omewhere).
6. Tokyo mo itta.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.956758631578947">
&apos;Someone went to Tokyo also,
The mo in sentence 5 and 6 means &apos;also&apos;.
Therefore these sentences are derived from
different syntactical constructions, that
is. sentences 7 and 8. respectively.
7. John qa itta.
&apos;John went (somewhere).&apos;
8. Tokyo ni itta.
&apos;Someone went to Tokyo.&apos;
Furthermore. as illustrated in sen-
tences 5 through 6, noun phrases may be
deleted freely. provided the context
gives full information. In sentences 6 and
7. a noun phrase indicating the goal is
missing and sentences 6 and 8 lack that
indicating the subject. Finally, there
are many pairs of lexically related verbs,
transitive and instrasitive. indicating
the :;ame phenomenon differently
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.88232575">
9. John ga Mary ni hon o miseta.
&apos;John showed a book to Mary.&apos;
10. Mary ga hon o mita.
&apos;Mary saw a book.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993945">
The system under consideration uti-
lizes some of the above features (case
marking and lexically related verbs) and
in turn can be used to ease difficulties
of automatic understanding, caused by some
other features (case hiding. ambiguious
case marking and deletion of noun
Phrases.)

III. VERB CLASS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976025">
The system is illustrated below with
verbs related to the notion of movement.
The verb classes in this category are as
follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995134">
(1) Verb class of causality of
movement (CM)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8232462">
Examples:tsureteiku &apos;to take (a
person)*
tsuretekuru &apos;to bring (a
person)*
hakobu &apos;to carry&apos;
yaru &apos;to give&apos;
oshieru to tell&apos;
Verbs of this class indicate that someone
causes something or someone moves. How to
move varies as seen later.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.785787">
(2) Verb class of movement(MV)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.957403166666667">
Examples:iku &apos;to go&apos;
kuru &apos;to come&apos;
idousuru &apos;to move&apos;
Verbs of this class indicated that some-
thing or someone moves from one place to
another.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945592">
(3) Verb class of existence(EX)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.83000675">
Examples:iru &apos;(animate) be&apos;
aru &apos;(inanimate) be
Verbs of this class indicate the existence
of something or someone.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990213">
410
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.962714133333333">
(4) Verb class of possession(PS)
Examples:motsu &apos;to possess&apos;
kau &apos;to keep&apos;
Verbs of this class indicate someone&apos;s
possession of something or someone.
Notice that the fundamental notion of
MOVE here is much wider than the normal
meaning of the word &apos;move&apos;. When someone
learns some idea from someone else. it is
understood that an abstract notion moves
from the former to the latter.
Furthermore, verbs of each class dif-
fer slightly from each other in semantic
structures. But the difference is de-
scribed as difference in features filling

ence between yaru, &apos;to give&apos; and uru. &apos;to

instrument, while the former does not. In-

syntactic structures of the verb classes
discusssed above is presented in Diagram
Items filling the case slots in the
semantic frame. or the noun phrases in
surface syntactic structures. have partic-
ular conditions depending on individual
verbs. Some examples of conditions are
presented in Diagram III.
By these conditions, the mapping of
syntactic structures presented in Diagram
II is transformed to that in terms of in-
dividual verbs. Furthermore, rules of di-
rections for reasoning presented in Dia-
gram IV connect specific sentences.
Take the following sentence for example.
11. John ga keiki o Mary ni mottekita.
(-ani) (+ani) (CV-past)
&apos;John brought a cake for Mary.&apos;
has related sentences like the following.
12. Keiki ga Mary ni itta.
&apos;A cake went to Mary.&apos;
13. Keiki ga Mary (no tokoro) ni aru.
&apos;There is a cake at Mary&apos;s&apos;
14. Marl/ ga keiki o motteiru.
&apos;Mary has cake.
As far as all the rules and conditions are
incorporated into the computer program.
inference would be possible among sen-
tences 11 through 14 in automatic text un-
derstanding. Furthermore. this system can
also be utilized in the automatic text
understanding by locating missing noun
phrases and determining ambiguous grammat-
ical cases in the sentence, finding seman-
tically related sentences between the
questions and the text. and gathering the
right semantic information.
Since this system uses information on
syntactic structures, it is much simpler
in terms of the semantic structures than
the Conceptual Dependencey Model, for in-
stance. and the mapping among the sentence
patterns semantically related much more
explicit.
