The representation of whole texts is a major concern of
the field known as information retrieval (IR), an impor-
tant aspect of which might more precisely be called
&apos;document retrieval&apos; (DR). The DR situation, with which
we will be concerned, is, in general, the following:
a. A user, recognizing an information need, presents to
an IR mechanism (i.e., a collection of texts, with a
set of associated activities for representing, stor-
ing, matching, etc.) a request, based upon that need
hoping that the mechanism will be able to satisfy
that need.
b. The task of the IR mechanism is to present the user
with the text(s) that it judges to be most likely to
satisfy the user&apos;s need, based upon the request.
c. The user examines the text(s) and her/his need is
satisfied completely or partially or not at all.
The user&apos;s judgement as to the contribution of each
text in satisfying the need establishes that text&apos;s
usefulness or relevance to the need.
Several characteristics of the problem which DR attempts
to solve make current IR systems rather different from,
say, question-answering systems. One is that the needs
which people bring to the system require, in general,
responses consisting of documents about the topic or
problem rather than specific data, facts, or inferences.
Another is that these needs are typically not precisely
specifiable, being expressions of an anomaly in the
user&apos;s state of knowledge. A third is that this is an
essentially probabilistic, rather than deterministic
situation, and is likely to remain so. And finally,
the corpus of documents in many such systems is in the
order of millions (of, say, journal articles or ab-
stracts), and the potential needs are, within rather
broad subject constraints, unpredictable. The DR situ-
ation thus puts certain constraints upon text represen-
tation and relaxes others. The major relaxation is
that it may not be necessary in such systems to produce
representations which are capable of inference. A con-
straint, on the other hand, is that it is necessary to
have representations which can indicate problems that a
user cannot her/himself specify, and a matching system
whose strategy is to predict which documents might re-
solve specific anomalies. This strategy can, however,
be based on probability of resolution, rather than cer-
tainty. Finally, because of the large amount of data,.
it is desirable that the representation techniques be
reasonably simple computationally.
Appropriate text representations, given these con-
straints, must necessarily be of whole texts, and prob-
ably ought to be themselves whole, unitary structures,
rather than lists of atomic elements, each treated sep-
arately. They must be capable of representing problems,
or needs, as well as expository texts, and they ought
to allow for some sort of pattern matching. An obvious
general schema within these requirements is a labelled
associative network.
Our approach to this general problem is strictly prob-
lem-oriented. We begin with a representation scheme
which we realize is oversimplified, but which stands
within the constraints, and test whether it can be pro-
gressively modified in response to observed deficien-
cies, until either the desired level of performance in
solving the problem is reached, or the approach is shown
to be unworkable. We report here on some linguistical-
ly-derived modifications to a very simple, but neverthe-
less psychologically and linguistically based word-co-
occurrence analysis of text [1] (figure 1).

The original analysis was applied to two kinds of texts:
abstracts of articles representing documents stored by
the system, and a set of &apos;problem statements represent-
ing users&apos; information needs -- their anomalous states
of knowledge -- when they approach the system. The
analysis produced graph-like structures, or association
maps, of the abstracts and problem statements which were
evaluated by the authors of the texts (Figure 2)
(Figure 3).

CLUSTERING LARGE FILES OF DOCUMENTS
USING THE SINGLE-LINK METHOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812357142857">
A method for clustering large files of documents
using a clustering algorithm which takes 0(n==2)
operations (single-link) is proposed. This
method is tested on a file of 11,613 documents
derived from an operational system. One prop-
erty of the generated cluster hierarchy (hier-
archy connection percentage) is examined and
it indicates that the hierarchy is similar to
those from other test collections. A comparison
of clustering times with other methods shows
that large files can be clustered by single-
link in a time at least comparable to various
heuristic algorithms which theoretically require
fewer operations.

In general, the representations were seen as being ac-
curate reflections of the author&apos;s state of knowledge
or problem; however, the majority of respondents also
felt that some concepts were too strongly or weakly
connected, and that important concepts were omitted
(Table 1).
We think that at least some of these problems arise
because the algorithm takes no account of discourse
structure. But because the evaluations indicated that
the algorithm produces reasonable representations, we
have decided to amend the analytic structure, rather
than abandon it completely.

Our current modifications to the analysis consist pri-
marily of methods for translating facts about discourse
structure into rough equivalents within the word-co-
occurrence paradigm. We choose this strategy, rather
than attempting a complete and theoretically adequate
discourse analysis, in order to incorporate insights
about discourse without violating the cost . volume
constraints typical of DR systems. The modit-cations
are designed to recognize such aspects of discourse
structure as establishment of topic; setting of context;
summarizing; concept foregrounding; and stylistic vari-
ation. Textual characteristics which correspond with
these aspects include discourse-initial and discourse-
final sentences; title words in the text; equivalence
relations; and foregrounding devices (Figure 4).
1. Repeat first and last sentences of the text.
These sentences may include the more important con-
cepts, and thus should be more heavily weighted.
2. Repeat first sentence of paragraph after the last
sentence.
To integrate these sentences more fully into the
overall structure.
3. Make the title the first and last sentence of the
text, or overweight the score for each co-occurrence
containing a title word.
Concepts in the title are likely to be the most im-
portant in the text, yet are unlikely to be used
often in the abstract.
4. Hyphenate phrases in the input text (phrases chosen
algorithmically) and then either: a. Use the phrase
only as a unit equivalent to a single word in the
co-occurrence analysis; or b. use any co-occurrence
with either member of the phrase as a co-occurrence
with the phrase, rather than the individual word.
This is to control for conceptual units, as opposed
to conceptual relations.
5. Modify original definition of adjacency, which
counted stop-list words, to one which ignores stop-
list words. This is to correct for the distortion
caused by the distribution of function words in the
recognition of multi-word concepts.
