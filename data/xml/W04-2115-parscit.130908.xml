<bodyText confidence="0.999941538461538">
In this paper, we present the current state of
development of a large-scale lexicon built at
LabEL1 for Portuguese. We will concentrate on
multiword expressions (MWE), particularly on
multiword nouns, (i) illustrating their most relevant
morphological features, and (ii) pointing out the
methods and techniques adopted to generate the
inflected forms from lemmas. Moreover, we
describe a corpus-based aproach for the acquisition
of new multiword nouns, which led to a
significant enlargement of the existing lexicon.
Evaluation results concerning lexical coverage in
the corpus are also discussed.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99940964">
MWEs have been viewed, for long time, as
marginal idiosyncratic combinations of words. In
recent years, however, there has been a growing
awareness in the NLP community of the problems
that MWEs pose and the need for their robust
handling. Several major conferences and satellite
workshops have been dedicated to the subject
(ACL, EACL, LREC, for instance); major
publications devote thematic issues to MWEs.
Anticipating that growing interest, over the last
years, a significant part of LabEL’s research has
been devoted to the development of large-scale,
linguistically precise language resources, namely
to the construction of computational lexicons for
simple and multiword units (Eleutério et al., 1995;
Ranchhod et al., 1999; Ranchhod et al., 2004).
In fact, we have observed that MWEs are used
frequently in both everyday language and technical
and scientific texts to express ideas and concepts
that in general cannot be stated by “free” linguistic
structures. They include a large range of different
linguistic phenomena, such as: (i) lexical
compounds (nouns: cellular phone, rush hour, New
Jersey; adjectives: well-known; adverbs: for the
time being, in short; prepositions and conjunctions:

in spite of, in order to) (ii) phrasal verbs (give up);
(iii) light verbs (give a lecture); (iv) fixed
(proverbs and maxims) and semi-fixed sentences
(to see the light at the end of the tunnel; to take the
Lord’ name in vain). From a linguistic point of
view, all these expressions exhibit distributional
and selectional constraints, i.e. they lack
compositionality, and frequently have idiomatic
interpretations.
In this paper, we focus on multiword nouns.
Special attention will be given to their
formalization and generation, using INTEX, a
public FST (Finite-State Transducer) based NLP
system [Silberztein, 1993]. In this context, we
present the main characteristics of a new
inflectional module, conceived at LabEL, fully
compatible with this system. Next, we describe the
acquisition methodology used to gather new
dictionary entries in a fragment (extracts 1,520,001
to 1,567,625) of the non-annotated version of a
public Portuguese corpus, CETEMPublico2.
Finally, based on this experiment, we assess, on
the one hand, the dictionary increase, and, on the
other hand, the lexical coverage improvement in
the referred corpus.

2 Characterization of Multiword Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993569571428571">
Multiword (or compound) nouns are composed of
non-capitalized simple words. Superficially, they
seem to result from general rules of word
combinations but they present constraints
(morphological, combinatorial, etc.) concerning
the properties they were supposed to have.
Regarding inflection, general rules presented by
grammarians do apply to some cases, but most
compounds exhibit inflectional restrictions on
gender or number that cannot be described by the
morphological properties of their constituents.
Table 1 presents a few examples of the most
representative classes of compound nouns in
Portuguese.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.955393666666667">
2 CETEMPublico is a journalistic corpus containing
about 180 million words (see Santos and Rocha, 2001
for techical information).

Table 1: Some binary compound noun classes
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892529411765">
These classes represent binary compounds,
comprised of two content words (where one of
them is a noun), eventually connected by a
grammatical word3.
The classification criteria are based on the
noun’s internal structures, which are generally
associated with a characteristic inflectional pattern.
For instance, compound nouns belonging to the
NA class usually allow the inflection in gender
and/or number of both constituents (e.g. bomba
atómica, bombas atómicas); on the contrary, in the
majority of NDN compound nouns, only the first
noun can inflect (conselho de guerra, conselhos de
guerra).
In the following sections, further relevant
information on inflection, formalization and
generation of inflected forms will be given.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.8281" genericHeader="method">
3 Formalization of NA and NDN Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956363636364">
Following methods and formalisms introduced at
LADL [Gross, 1988; Courtois and Silberztein,
1990], linguistic attributes of simple and
multiword units are systematically encoded in
dictionaries compatible with INTEX.
In this system, compound word entries are
handled depending on their internal structure. They
are formalized and processed separately by
different programs.
In order to simplify the formalization of
linguistic attributes, and make the generation
process easier, we implemented a new inflectional
module compatible with INTEX system. The main
strength of this tool is allowing the simultaneous
generation of all compounds, regardless of their
internal structure, reusing the inflectional graphs
already built for simple words [Mota,
forthcoming]. The morphological constraints are
specified manually, assigning to each constituent
the inflectional code that corresponds to its
inflectional behavior within the compound, as
illustrated by the following dictionary entries:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.471602">
actor(N040) secundário(A001),N+NA+Hum
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.766554">
3 Even though less productive than the previous
structures, there are longer multi-word combinations
that may involve more than one compound form (e.g.
cabo de alta tensão, high-tension electricity cable).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989425666666667">
ser(N205) humano(A201),N+NA+Hum
ponto(N201) de vista,N+NDN+Fred
direitos(N292) de autor,N+NDN
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988842105263">
In the first compound, both constituents keep
their simple word dictionary inflectional code; they
inflect in gender and number, according to the
compound inflectional behavior.
On the other hand, the compound noun ser
humano inflects only in number, which means that
the masculine nominal constituent ser preserves its
inflectional code, but the adjectival constituent
humano (which also inflects in gender, as simple
word) receives a new code that just allows its
inflection in number within the compound.
In the case of the NDN compounds, as
previously mentioned, only the head can inflect:
ponto de vista inflects in number, so the head
receives a code allowing its inflection; direitos de
autor does not inflect (it is an exclusive masculine
plural noun), hence the head is assigned an
inflectional code that simply transmits these gender
and number features to the compound.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.967268" genericHeader="method">
4 Generation of Inflected Forms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997759333333333">
The following example illustrates how the new
inflection module uses the dictionary information,
briefly presented in the previous section:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.83933">
actor(N040) secundário(A001),N+NA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998925">
Inititally, the inflectional module generates the
inflected forms of the noun actor, based on the
inflectional paradigm described in the graph N040.
Then, it combines the resulting inflected nouns
with all inflected forms of the adjective
secundário, generated given graph A001.
Subsequentely, the combinations that do not verify
the gender and number agreement constraints are
eliminated. Additionally, the constituent
inflectional attributes are inherited by the
compound.
As a result, the following entries are obtained:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.5361095">
actor secundário,actor secundário.N+NA:ms
actriz secundária,actor secundário.N+NA:fs
actores secundários,actor secundário.N+NA:mp
actrizes secundárias,actor secundário.N+NA:fp
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923222222222">
This example illustrates the case where both
words that constitute the compound have similar
inflectional features. These attributes are directly
transferred to the inflected forms of the compound.
When one of the compound constituents does
not have either gender or number explicit
morphemes, as artista (which can be either a
masculine or a feminine singular form) in the
following entry:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.629523">
artista(N101) plástico(A001),N+NA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880375">
the inflectional module assigns to the compound
the morphological attributes of the constituent that
has explicit gender and/or number morphems (in
this case, plástico).
The compounds just illustrated belong to the NA
class4. The inflection of NDN forms simply
corresponds to the inflection of the head noun and
assigment of its attributes to the compoud.

5 Acquisition of New Entries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836902439024">
With the purpose of increasing the number of the
most representative nominal entries (NA and
NDN) in the common multiword dictionaries, we
used a corpus-based approach.
In the first stage, candidates were automatically
extracted from a fragment of CETEMPublico
corpus (from now on, acquisition corpus), using
INTEX. After tokenized by INTEX, 6,385,531
tokens (corresponding to 138,230 different tokens)
were identified in the acquisition corpus. From
those, 5,162,111 (138,174 different forms) are
alphabetic words.
LabEL’s simple and multiword electronic
dictionaries were then applied to the acquisition
corpus. These dictionaries contained 171,159
nominal entries, from which 82% were simple
words and 18% compounds. From the 22,581
compounds, 61,7% are NA, 33,6% are NDN and
the remaining 4,7% belong to other strucutres.
Candidate identification was performed using
the elementary regular expressions &lt;N&gt;de&lt;N&gt;
and (&lt;N:ms&gt;&lt;A:ms&gt; + &lt;N:fs&gt;&lt;A:fs&gt; +
&lt;N:mp&gt;&lt;A:mp&gt; + &lt;N:fp&gt;&lt;A:fp&gt;)5. They match
nominal compounds presenting, respectively, an
NDN and an NA structure. With respect to the
latter structure, the expression also guarantees
morphological agreement between nouns and
adjectives.
Such expressions recognized in the acquisition
corpus 242,527 (187,146 different forms)
candidates, from which 117,616 (69,066 different
forms) are NDN structures and 230,761 (118,080
different forms) are NA structures.
Each class’s candidates were integrated into a
concordance, to which were applied the existing
compound dictionaries. The resulting list of non-
recognized candidates was then manually reviewed
by linguists, aiming the selection and linguistic
formalization of valid compounds. Graphic 1
reflects the effort involved in the selection
procedure.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9363736">
4 This procedure also applies to other compounds
composed of two or more elements that inflect (e.g.
acidente(N201) vascular(A205) cerebral(A211), stroke).
5 Regular expressions are written according to the
INTEX format.
</footnote>
<figureCaption confidence="0.68096">
Graphic 1: NA and NDN candidates
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984885">
One clear observation is that there is a great
discrepancy between the initial candidate lists
(NA: 238,313; NDN: 116,246) and the final
selected compound forms (NA: 21,289; NDN:
3750)6. The percentage in the graphic was
calculated based on the number of non-recognized
different candidates (NA: 104,715; NDN: 56,741).
Another interesting observation regarding
Graphic 1 is that the size of the NA candidate list
is slightly more than a double of the NDN
candidate list. Nevertheless, the NA candidate list
includes proportionally more valid compound
forms (NA: 20%; NDN: 7%). In addition, the final
selected NA compound list contains about five
times more entries than the corresponding NDN
list.
The selected compound forms resulted in a total
of 19,825 NA and 3,769 NDN canonical entries,
which correspond respectively to 41,267 NA and
7,722 NDN inflected forms.

6 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974375">
Before lexical acquisition, the application of
LabEL’s lexical resources to the acquistion corpus
allowed assigning 94,229 different simple word
tags (34,892 nouns) and 15,120 different
compound tags (13,594 nouns). Hence, the
compound noun percentage is low (28%),
compared to the number of different nominal tags
assigned to simple forms. This discrepancy is not
unexpected, regarding the low number of nominal
compound entries in dictionaries.
As previously mentioned, the gathering of NA
and NDN compounds in the acquisition corpus led
to the formalization of 23,594 canonical entries.
Accordingly, the inflected form dictionary
increased approximately 3 to 4 times (more 53,815
entries, in a total of 76,396 entries).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9785108">
6 In this study, we did not assess the list of candidates
recognized by dictionaries, which means that we did not
count the hypothetical cases of embedded compound
forms (e.g. cabo de alta-tensão, high-tension electricity
cable).

When we apply the enlarged dictionary to the
same corpus, we observe that the percentage of
compound nouns with respect to the total of
nominal tags incresead significantly. Now, 40,902
different compound forms were identified, which
means that more than a half of the nouns in the
corpus correspond to multiwords.
Considering the compound occurrences in the
acquisition corpus, Graphic 2 illustrates their
frequency distribution.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.648241">
Graphic 2: Compound noun frequency
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
It is important to draw attention to the fact that
89% of compound forms occur less than five
times; in particular, 58% occur just once.
These figures demonstrate that, contrary to what
is observed with simple nouns, which are very
recurrent in texts, the average number of
compound occurrences is, in general, extremely
low. This evidence raises the question whether
statistical methods, based on frequencies, can
adequately handle the majority of compound
forms.
Regardless of wether the compound acquisition
has been done exclusively in a fragment of
CETEMPúblico, the application of the new
dictionary to the remaining fragments of this
corpus also increased the number of tags assigned
to compound words.
On average, before lexical acquisition about
13,000 different compound nouns were
recognized; this number more than doubled
(approx. 33,000) when we applied the enlarged
dictionaries to the other fragments. As mentioned
before, in the acquisition corpus, the number of
compound tags exceeded the number of simple
noun tags. So, we may infer that a similar behavior
would be expected in the remaining fragments, if
they were also considered.

7 Final Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956842105263">
In this paper, we described a new FST-based
compound inflectional tool. The main advantage of
this inflectional module is reusing INTEX simple
word inflectional graphs in the simultaneous
generation of all compound, regardless of their
internal structure. Even though it has only been
tested in the formalization and generation of
Portuguese compound nouns, we believe it can be
easily adapted to handle other languages having
similar compound inflectional behavior.
A corpus-based approach to multiword
acquisition was also presented. We showed that, in
spite of involving human effort, the results
obtained effectively improved dictionary coverage.
Moreover, the results concerning compound noun
frequency raised the question whether statistical
approaches, based on word frequencies, are
(un)adequate to extract multiword nouns from
texts.

Several major conferences and satellite workshops have been dedicated to the subject (ACL, EACL, LREC, for instance); major publications devote thematic issues to MWEs. Anticipating that growing interest, over the last years, a significant part of LabEL’s research has been devoted to the development of large-scale, linguistically precise language resources, namely to the construction of computational lexicons for simple and multiword units (Eleutério et al., 1995; Ranchhod et al., 1999; Ranchhod et al., 2004). In fact, we have observed that MWEs are used frequently in both everyday language and technical and scientific texts to express ideas and concepts that in general cannot be stated by “free” linguistic structures. They include a large range of different linguistic phenomena, such as: (i) lexical compounds (nouns: cellular phone, rush hour, New Jersey; adjectives: well-known; adverbs: for the time being, in short; prepositions and conjunctions: 1 LabEL (Laboratório de Engenharia da Linguagem) http://label.ist.utl.pt in spite of, in order to) (ii) </context>

Regarding inflection, general rules presented by grammarians do apply to some cases, but most compounds exhibit inflectional restrictions on gender or number that cannot be described by the morphological properties of their constituents. Table 1 presents a few examples of the most representative classes of compound nouns in Portuguese. 2 CETEMPublico is a journalistic corpus containing about 180 million words (see Santos and Rocha, 2001 for techical information).

From a linguistic point of view, all these expressions exhibit distributional and selectional constraints, i.e. they lack compositionality, and frequently have idiomatic interpretations. In this paper, we focus on multiword nouns. Special attention will be given to their formalization and generation, using INTEX, a public FST (Finite-State Transducer) based NLP system [Silberztein, 1993]. In this context, we present the main characteristics of a new inflectional module, conceived at LabEL, fully compatible with this system. Next, we describe the acquisition methodology used to gather new dictionary entries in a fragment (extracts 1,520,001 to 1,567,625) of the non-annotated version of a public Portuguese corpus, CETEMPublico2. Finally, based on this experiment, we assess, on the one hand, the dictionary increase, and, on the other hand, the lexical coverage improvement in the referred corpus. 2 Characterization of Multiword Nouns Multiword (or compound) nouns are composed of</context>
