Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999783411764706">
With the rapid development of Internet
and many related technology, Web has
become the main source of information.
For many search engines, there are
many different identities in the returned
results of character information query.
Thus the Research of People disambig-
uation is important. In this paper we at-
tempt to solve this problem by combing
different knowledge. As people usually
have different kind of careers, so we first
utilize this knowledge to classify people
roughly. Then we use social context of
people to identify different person. The
experimental results show that these
knowledge are helpful for people disam-
biguation.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987634125">
For the real world, many people share one
name; this is a very common phenomenon. Ac-
cording to the third national census sample sur-
vey conducted by the State Language Commit-
tee in 1989, the duplicate names rate for single
name was 67.7%, whereas that of double name
was 32.4%.
There are two commonly used name disam-
biguation approach, one is based on the vector
space model, and the other is based on so-
cial networks.
The first is text-based vector space clustering
approach. An entity can be expressed as one
vector which is formed according to the content
word of the original document. And then the si-
milarity is used to merge documents or classify
documents.
The second method is based on social net-
works. The first step of the method is to build
social networks, by analyze the relationship of
different people. Generally if two people’s name
always occurs in same document or very near
context ,they will have close relations, one of
them will be helpful for disambiguate the other.
In this paper, we first use the domain of cha-
racter’s document to classify roughly, and then
context information using social networking is
considered again to disambiguate person’s
name again.
2 the principle of our system
Fig.1. shows the basic principle of our system.
The basic steps are:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.48595">
1) documents with same people’s name
are input;
2) classify these documents into seven ca-
reers which include Cultural, adminis-
trative, military, science, education,
sports, health, economic and etc;

<bodyText confidence="0.947003380952381">
Fig.1. the general framework of our approach
3) Judge if the people are reporter in doc-
ument, if yes; separate them according
to their address.
4) Separate documents by using social
networks. This is because different
people usually have different social re-
lations. Different social relations usual-
ly means different people and different
identity. The social network of one
people is gained by counting its co-
occur frequency with other peoples.
rates were high. The reasons include the follow-
ing:
First, in he document pre-classification
processing, the named entity recognition has not
been carried out in the text dealing with the clas-
sification of the document. Some of them are not
the people’s name.
Second, different people may have same do-
main, thus the accuracy is adversely affected.

4 Summaries
In this paper, we utilize two kind of knowledges:
1) people always have his own career; 2) people
have his own social circle. We think these in-
formation will be more helpful for disambiguation.
Thus we attempt to solve this problem by com-
bing different knowledge. As people usually

this knowledge to classify people roughly. Then
we use social context of people to identify differ-
ent person. In the future we wish to address the
following aspects: 1) add and improve name
recognition accuracy; 2) extract and select the
useful context of person’s name, which is the
problem of information extraction; 3) recognize
some kind of public people such as political
leaders, famous singers and etc. to improve the
effect of social networks.
