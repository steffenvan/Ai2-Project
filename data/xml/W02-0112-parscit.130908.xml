<bodyText confidence="0.999765421052632">
The paper gives a review of teaching
Computational Linguistics (CL) at the
University of Tartu. The current
curriculum foresees the possibility of
studying CL as an independent 4-year
subject in the Faculty of Philosophy on
the bachelor stage. In connection with
the higher education reform in Estonia,
new curricula will be introduced from
the next study year where the 3-year
bachelor stage will be followed by a 2-
year master’s stage. It will then be
possible to study CL proceeding from
two paths: in the Faculty of Philosophy,
and additionally also in the Faculty of
Mathematics and Computer Science.
This way two types of specialists will
be trained who will hopefully be able to
complement each other in team-work.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939404255319">
Computational Linguistics as a special subject can
in Estonia only be studied at the University of
Tartu (UT).
Computational linguistics as an independent
subject has been taught at UT from the study year
1998/99, various separate courses from the study
year 1996/97. The curriculum and various new
courses were developed with the support provided
by a number of RESP projects. Based on the
experience of Western universities, the topics of
linguistics, computer science, mathematics and
computational linguistics were selected. As the
subject was launched in the Department of
Estonian and Finno-Ugric Linguistics, Faculty of
Philosophy, then linguistic subjects prevail in the
curriculum. But the tuition is provided jointly by
two faculties: Faculty of Philosophy teaches
linguistic subjects, Faculty of Mathematics and
Computer Science teaches mathematics and
informatics subjects, the computational linguistic
subjects have been divided between these two
faculties. Language of instruction is Estonian.
Preparing the lectures in new subjects has been
mostly accompanied by making available these
materials on the web as well. A number of
students of computer science and linguistics also
listen to several computational linguistics lectures
as electives or optional subjects. Therefore we
face the problem how to make these subjects
interesting and manageable for students with
various qualifications.
New curricula will take effect as of the study
year 2002/2003 at UT. According to them, the 3
year bachelor study is followed by 2-year master
studies which in turn may be followed by 4-year
doctoral studies (so far the 4+2+4 year model was
used). Bachelor studies will provide the general
basic higher education, master studies will lead to
a qualification in a specific subject. The new
modified curriculum takes into account the
experience obtained in the process of teaching so
far. In addition to that, the new curriculum for
computer science foresees the (new) possibility to
major in language technology. In the following,
we will present the structure of the curricula and
our experience so far in teaching the subjects of
computational linguistics.

2 Background to tuition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999234743243244">
Tuition can be efficient only when the lecturers
themselves are active researchers.
R&amp;D work in computational linguistics and
language technology in Estonia is being carried
out, in addition to UT, in the Institute of the
Estonian Language (IEL is a research institution)
and the Institute of Cybernetics of Tallinn
Technical University. The IEL focuses on
compiling computer lexicons but also on the
computer (morphological) processing of Estonian.
The topics at the Institute of Cybernetics include
the generation of spoken Estonian (together with
IEL), the Institute has also started compiling
databases necessary for speech recognition.
The R&amp;D at the University of Tartu has
focused on the computer analyses of Estonian
texts and compiling the text corpora of Estonian
underlying that research. The major research
topics include
Formalising the morphology and syntax of the
Estonian language
Formalising the semantics of Estonian (incl
compiling a lexico-semantic database)
Pragmatics: modelling the Estonian (spoken)
dialogue.
Based on the results of the research, various
linguistic software and resources have been
elaborated at UT:
The morphological analyser and generator of
Estonian; the university spin-off language
software company Filosoft in turn has used
these resources for creating the Estonian spell
checker and hyphenator (included in the MS
Office package)
Estonian morphologic disambiguator and
syntax analyser
Various corpora of written Estonian for the
period 1890-1990 (total 3 million words),
partly morphologically and syntactically
tagged
A corpus of spoken Estonian (300 000 words
transliterated), and a corpus of Estonian
dialogues based on it (60 000 words).
UT computational linguists have participated in a
number of international projects, e.g. GLOSSER,
MULTEXT-EAST, TELRI-I, TELRI-II,
CONCEDE, EuroWordNet, BABEL, to name
some, and carried out numerous projects
commissioned by the Estonian Science
Foundation and the Estonian Informatics Centre.
The plans for the next years include further
development of language software, incl
morphological and semantic disambiguator and
the syntactic analyser and generator, to study and
model the formal structure of dialogues, to expand
the tagged corpora. All these outputs can be used
in various language technology applications, from
aids to the text compiler (e.g. grammar and style
checkers in a text editing programme) to machine
translation or man-machine dialogue in Estonian.
Previously, in 1960s, UT was engaged in
language statistics and automated information
retrieval (in 1970s, an information retrieval
system for legal texts was developed at UT).
In the second half of 1960s, a special structural
linguistics work group (the so-called generative
grammar group) was active at the Department of
the Estonian Language. It included lecturers,
doctoral students and students. Quite a few of the
present computational linguists received their first
knowledge of CL from that group.
Until 1998, obtaining the CL education was
only possible according to individually tailored
study plans.

3.1 Earlier experience
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966930857142857">
While elaborating the CL curriculum and
preparing and modifying new courses, we have
tried to take into account the experience of other
universities.
As demonstrated by a questionnaire carried out
in March 1999 in 60 European universities where
CL is being taught (de Smedt et al., 1999), three
options are basically used in teaching CL and
language technology:
A minor in philology (dominating)
A minor in Computer Science
An independent subject.
The curricula typically include 4 blocks of
subjects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997538">
1) Linguistics
2) Computer Science
3) Mathematics
4) Computational Linguistics
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.889475476190476">
At UT, as already mentioned, CL is taught as
an independent subject in the Faculty of
Philosophy. The amount of studies is
characterised by the number of credit points (CP)
where 1 CP corresponds to 40 hours of work by
the student (incl. independent work). The total
amount of the 4-year bachelor studies is 160 CP.
In the current curriculum, the amount of CL is
60 CP and it includes the same 4 typical blocks as
named above:
Linguistics 20 CP
Computer Science 3 CP
Mathematics 10 CP
Computational Linguistics 27 CP, from them
electives 4 CP and the bachelor thesis 12 CP.
As may be seen, the block of Computer
Science is very small (presently, it includes only
the subjects ”Prolog for linguists”, 2 CP, and
”UNIX for linguists”, 1 CP). In the new
curriculum, we have increased the importance of
that block.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999436">
3.2 New curriculum
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823710526316">
The necessity for the new curriculum was
prompted by the higher education reform in
Estonia. The reform was launched in 2000 and is
based on various international documents and
agreements (Magna Charta Universitatum).
The main objectives of the Estonian higher
education reform are:
to expand the cross-curriculum share
of subject areas by widening the
opportunities of interdisciplinary
studies;
to simplify the system of university
education levels;
to simplify and expand the
opportunities of students from
different specialities to continue their
studies in other universities (also
outside Estonia).
The Bachelor level education will be achieved
after completing a 3-year curriculum (nominal
study period, 120 CP). The Master level education
will be achieved upon completing a 5-year
curriculum (nominal study period, 200 CP). The
Doctoral level education will be achieved upon
completing a 9-year curriculum (nominal study
period, 360 CP) and defending the doctoral thesis.
Bachelor studies will provide general
theoretical education at the university level. In the
first year, the students study subjects shared by
the curricula of one broad field. The second year
they study following the narrow field module and
the third year is devoted to specialised subjects.
Master studies will provide special,
professional knowledge and vocational skills.
The ”Estonian and Finno-Ugric linguistics”
curriculum that will become operational in the
Faculty of Philosophy foresees the possibility of
majoring in computational linguistics.
In the bachelor studies one has to take
two obligatory base modules:
”Humanities” (16 CP) and ”Estonian
philology” (16 CP);
obligatory narrow field module ”Estonian
and Finno-Ugric linguistics” (16 CP);
obligatory speciality module
”Computational linguistics” (20 CP, incl a
bachelor’s thesis 4 CP);
two modules of elective subjects (each 16
CP) from the list of the following subjects:
”Estonian language”, ”Estonian language
and culture for non-Estonians”, ”Finnish
language and culture”, ”Finno-Ugric
languages”, ”Hungarian language and
culture” and ”General linguistics”;
electives and optional subjects (20 CP) that
may be chosen from any curriculum.
The CL speciality module entails the following
subjects: ”Mathematics for computational
linguists I”, “Programming”, “Data analysis in
humanities”, “Linguistic theories for
computational linguists”, each amounting to 4 CP.
Upon completing bachelor studies, the student
will receive the Bachelor degree in Estonian and
Finno-Ugric linguistics. As a rule, this education
will not guarantee entry to the labour market (at
least not as a computational linguist) but has to be
followed by master studies. It is assumed that at
least 75% of students admitted to bachelor studies
will continue their master studies.
Master studies curriculum comprises of
speciality studies (56 CP), master thesis (20 CP)
and optional subjects (4 CP). A prerequisite for
starting the master’s studies is either a bachelor’s
degree or education level corresponding to it. A
preliminary condition for entrance to the CL
speciality is having taken the speciality module
during the bachelor studies. Thus every person
with a bachelor’s degree who has taken the 4
subjects comprising the CL speciality module may
enter the CL master’s studies.
In master studies, the CL speciality studies will
consist of compulsory subjects (22 CP) and
electives (34 CP). The compulsory subjects are
“Introduction to CL”, “Corpus linguistics”,
“Language technology”, “Mathematics for
computational linguists II” and the master’s
seminar. The list of electives is open and will be
updated according to requirements and
possibilities.
The present list includes subjects from
linguistics, computer science and CL.
Linguistics subjects include, for example
“Phonology and morphology”, „Syntax of
Estonian“, “Semantics”, “Theories of linguistic
communication“, „Pragmatics”. Computer science
subjects included in the list are “Artificial
Intelligence I and II”, “Applied software: Perl“,
„Databases”; Computational Linguistics subjects
include such as “Computational morphology”,
“Computational lexicology”, “Syntactic analyser”,
etc.
The majority of the subjects are the same that
have been and are taught within the existing
curriculum but there will also be several new
ones, e.g. “Statistical models of natural
languages” and “Introduction to speech
technology”.
The qualification conferred to a graduate will
be that of master of Estonian and Finno-Ugric
linguistics (computational linguistics). This is a
specialist whose computational linguistics
education is based on linguistics (this has been the
case up to now when studying according to the
present curriculum).

<bodyText confidence="0.999976562500001">
In connection with preparing new curricula it
became possible to start preparing computational
linguists with a different education at UT based
on computer science –language technology
studies. Proceeding from the new computer
science curriculum to come into force in the
Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science it
is possible to choose blocks of linguistics and CL
subjects that have been named language
technology modules (to differentiate them from
the CL modules of the curriculum of Estonian and
Finno-Ugric linguistics in the Faculty of
Philosophy).
Bachelor studies in computer science will
provide general knowledge in the classical
branches of mathematics and basic knowledge of
computer software, hardware, networks and
systems, artificial intelligence, software
technologies and data protection and a certain
amount of practical skills for work in the
computer science (incl programming skills). It is
possible to choose between theoretical computer
science, software systems and language
technology. Upon completing bachelor studies,
the student will receive the Bachelor degree in
Computer Science.
The language technology narrow field module
(16 CP) comprises the subjects “Language
technology”, “Introduction to CL”, “Corpus
linguistics”, “Introduction to general linguistics”
and “Database theory”.
Master studies in computer science will
provide profound knowledge in one area of the
computer science enabling the person to carry out
development activities in that area; skills to
provide consultations; team-work and project
management skills. It is possible to major in
theoretical computer science, cryptology or
language technology.
The qualification conferred to a graduate will
be that of master of computer science.
A prerequisite for entrance to master’s studies
is the bachelor’s degree in the computer science
(or in a close speciality) and prerequisite subjects
amounting to 20 CP (Object-oriented
programming, Algorithms and data structures,
Introduction to mathematical logics, Elements of
discrete mathematics, Algebra I, Data bases).
The didactics of informatics and master
seminar are compulsory for all master students
(both 4 CP); optional subjects may be chosen for
the amount of 4 CP.
Those who major in language technology will
have the following compulsory subjects in master
studies: Software technology, Automata,
languages and translators, Graphs, Theory of
databases, Artificial Intelligence I, Computational
morphology, Syntax theories and models,
Computational lexicology, Semantics, Statistical
models of natural languages, total 32 CP. In
addition to that, 16 CP of electives from the open
list that will be updated according to needs and
opportunities as the similar list for computational
linguistics
Although these two lists have a quite big
overlapping area they are not the same. In case of
computational linguistics, linguistic subject will
take up a major part of the list; in case of
language technology, computer science subjects
will replace them (e.g. Methods of logical
programming, Methods of functional
programming, Systems modelling, Formal
languages).
Therefore, a person who has completed this
curriculum is an information scientist who has
additionally studied linguistic and computational
linguistic subjects to such an extent that he/she
will have a systematic picture of the tasks of
natural language processing and will be able to
solve these tasks in co-operation with linguists.

5 Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965023809524">
The modules of CL and LT contain a number of
common subjects that have also to be taught
jointly to the students majoring in CL and LT.
Preceding from earlier experience it may be
assumed that the total number of listeners will not
be big but they are with varied preparation. While
teaching according to the present curriculum there
have been groups including CL students, students
from different linguistics fields (Roman-German
philology or Estonian as a foreign language) as
well as students of computer science. The new
curricula have “legalised” the different
backgrounds of the students. This will be a
challenge to the lecturers: how to present the
material in a way that is understandable and
manageable for the students, at the same time not
being too simple for some students. So far we
have overcome the problem by giving different
assignments to students with different
background. E.g. the students of computer science
compile a language processing program while the
students of linguistics work with language
corpora. In the future these problems will be more
acute and require a complex solution. For
example, how to compose teams of students with
different qualification in such a way that by
complementing each other they would be able to
solve a joint problem.
Another problem is a small number of students
attending special courses. One solution to it could
be the web-based tuition, i.e. not only the
availability of teaching materials over the web but
a special distance learning environment
integrating lecture materials, individualised/
personally tailored assignments and check of
knowledge. UT has successfully implemented the
learning environment WebCT that already
includes a number of courses (in the framework of
the eUniversity project). These do not include any
CL courses so far which means that we have to
start preparing them by using the already existing
web course materials.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.999517" genericHeader="conclusions">
6 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885285714286">
Our experience in teaching and preparing
computational linguists is not extensive yet.
Nevertheless, the first CL students have finished
their studies and it seems that there will be
interested students in the future as well. In
addition to that, students of different subjects
have attended various CL courses (mainly
“Introduction to CL” and “Language
technology”). Students of CL take part in our
projects and in our joint seminars thus being
exposed from the very beginning to real-life tasks.
Therefore we expect them to become qualified
labour to universities, research institutions and
language software companies.
