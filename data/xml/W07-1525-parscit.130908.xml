This document outlines minimal design
principles underlying annotation of
coreference relations in PoCoS, a scheme
for cross-linguistic anaphoric annotation.
We identify language-independent princi-
ples for markable identification which are
essential for comparability of annotations
produced for different languages. We fur-
ther suggest a clear and motivated structure
of annotation stages, the separation of a
coarse-grained core and a family of more
elaborate extended schemes, and strategies
for the systematic treatment of ambiguity.
Explicit mark-up of ambiguities is a novel
feature. We implemented three instantia-
tions of PoCoS for German, English and
Russian applied to corpora of newspaper
texts.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.988180928571428">
Anaphoric annotation is notoriously problematic
because of ambiguity and subjectivity issues. One
has to deal with them at two stages: 1) by design-
ing annotation guidelines; 2) by performing anno-
tation. As for 1), it is a well-known problem that
different schemes propose different annotation de-
cisions. As for 2), different annotators may have
different judgments on coreference-related issues.
The current paper focuses on the general principles
and strategies of annotating coreference — the theo-
retical core that should logically precede any anno-
tation decisions or schemes, but has not been for-
mulated explicitly by now.
The number of existing schemes released just in
the last few years is overwhelming and is out of the

scope here. The MUC is still generally accepted as
the most standard-like annotation scheme
(Hirschman, 1997). Given its simplicity is its most
important advantage, it has been criticized for its
limited coverage and its contra-intuitive under-
standing of coreference. One of the most well-
known later approaches is MATE/GNOME (Poe-
sio, 2004). As the author fairly notices, &amp;quot;there can
be no such thing as a general-purpose anaphoric
annotation instructions&amp;quot;, due to the complexity of
phenomena associated with the term of anaphora.
So, its essential idea is combining a &amp;quot;general-
purporse markup scheme&amp;quot; (MATE) with applica-
tion-specific scheme instantiations (GNOME). In
PoCoS, we adapted and elaborated this idea, by
suggesting the Core and Extended Schemes.
The PoCoS, the Potsdam Coreference Scheme,
both adapts selected features of existing schemes
and implements a set of innovative features. We
distinguish between the Core and Extended
Scheme: the Core Scheme is general and reusable,
while the Extended Scheme supports a wider range
of specific extensions, see fig. 1. Here, we are talk-
ing about English and German instantiations of the
PoCoS Core Scheme.

Coreference is a relation between textual elements,
&amp;quot;referring expressions&amp;quot;, which denote the same
entity. Semantically, these expressions are proto-
typical objects or &amp;quot;(discourse) referents&amp;quot; (Kart-
tunen, 1976). Given a pair of two coreferring ex-
pressions, the preceding expression is termed ante-
cedent, the subsequent one is termed anaphor.
Subject to annotation are &amp;quot;markables&amp;quot; defined as
a cover-term for potential anaphors and their ante-
cedents. Coreference annotation consists of as-
signment of relations pointing from an anaphor to
an antecedent markable. Whether two markables
are co-referent, i.e. referring to the same discourse
referent, can be determined by a substitution test. If

the substitution of anaphor and antecedent yield
the same interpretation of the text, these are
deemed coreferential.
Syntactically, a markable is typically a phrase
with a nominal or a pronominal head. According to
the referential properties a syntactic construction
typically has, we distinguish between primary
markables, i.e. potential anaphors, and secondary
markables, expressions which can not serve as
anaphors, but only as antecedents.

3 Annotation principles
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999466">
3.1 A principled approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976308666666667">
In order to develop an annotation scheme which
is maximally consistent, we initially identified a
set of axiomatic requirements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9956804">
• CONSTITUENCY
o a primary or secondary markable must be an
independent syntactic constituent
• COMPLETENESS
o neither sub-tokens nor non-phrasal nomi-
nals are subject to annotation, only syntac-
tic words (tokens) and phrases are
• CONSISTENCY
o corresponding features have to be analyzed
in a corresponding way
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.93426145">
CONSTITUENCY and COMPLETENESS are necessary
pre-conditions for an alignment between syntactic
and anaphoric annotation, CONSISTENCY implies
that annotation principles must be formulated in a
way that allows for inter-subjective and cross-
linguistically valid annotation decisions. While
CONSTITUENCY and COMPLETENESS define con-
straints for markable identification, consistency
also affects selection preferences among potential
antecedents, and it motivates the explicit represen-
tation of anaphoric ambiguity in PoCoS.
In addition to these requirements, we add the
preference for MAXIMAL ANALYSIS. It suggests
longer anaphoric chains are preferred to the shorter
ones by annotation. This defines preferences for
coding decisions by ambiguity (see 4.1).
In the remainder of this section, annotation prin-
ciples employed in the PoCoS scheme are shortly
presented and discussed as to their relationship to
these four requirements.

3.2 Markable identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987389043478261">
Cross-linguistically consistent markable identifica-
tion strategies are a necessary pre-condition for a
comparative evaluation of anaphor annotation and
anaphor resolution across different languages. It
has been controversial, however, how to set mark-
able boundaries. So, for example, Ge et al. (1998)
and, MUC (Hirschman, 1997) propose a minimal
string constraint motivated by evaluation consid-
erations. This procedure leads to systematic viola-
tions of the CONSTITUENCY and COMPLETENESS
principles, though, cf. the potential markables

(1) The [Denver]?-based con-
cern, which emerged from ban-
cruptcy ... its new, post-
[bancruptcy]? law structure
...&amp;quot; (WSJ, 1328)
We explicitly propose a maximum size principle as
an alternative to the minimum string constraint
(see Principle 1 below). So, a markable consists of
the head, usually a noun or a pronoun, and of all
modifiers, attributes, relative clauses, appositions,
and dislocated elements attached to the head.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.81491">
Principle 1 Maximum size
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999487409090909">
One markable includes all modifications of its
head.
Prepositions can be regarded as modifications of a
noun as well, and following this line of
argumentation, the seemingly clear-cut
differentiation between NPs and PPs becomes
questionable, cf. the unclear status of Japanese
postpositions that can also be interpreted as
morphological case markers (Givon 2001:115f).
Further, in most European languages, functional
elements such as prepositions and determiners tend
to be fused. In combination with the
COMPLETENESS constraint, a possible NP-
preference for the selection of markables will
result in the selection of either PPs or non-phrasal
markables if preposition-determiner fusion occurs.
In order to achieve a more consistent analysis, in
which the syntactic status of a markable does not
depend on surface phenomena such as the
(optional) fusion of prepositions and determiner,
function words are integrated into a markable if
they modify it. As a consequence, CONSISTENCY

considerations call for the choice of PPs rather than
NPs as markables where possible.
Principle 2 Syntactic characterization
If a referring expression is modified by func-
tion words, e.g. a determiner or an adposition,
these are to be integrated into the markable.
Like Principle 1, Principle 2 originates from CON-
SISTENCY and COMPLETENESS requirements ap-
plied both within one language and considering
cross-linguistic validity, as the function of inflec-
tional marking in one language and the function of
prepositions in another language are exchangeable.
If a markable includes another markable, both
are specified as markables in annotation. Such
treatment provides consistency across languages,
(cf. the fragment of parallel text in ex. 2), and has
an additional advantage of representing the syntac-
tic structure of a markable.

3.3 Antecedent selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996208647058824">
For interconnecting co-referring expressions three
basic strategies can be employed: (i) leave this de-
cision to an annotator, (ii) connect all mentions to
the first one, or (iii) connect each following men-
tion to the immediately preceding one. In line with
previous research and in order to enhance consis-
tency, we opted for (iii), as Principle 3 states:
Principle 3 Chain principle
Mark the most recent mention of a referent as
antecedent, so that all mentions of the same ref-
erent make up an ordered chain.
Possessive pronouns can often be used at the be-
ginning of a sentence, in case they are resolved in
the same sentence as in (3) and (4). The chain
principle suggests selecting a pronoun as the chain-
initial element which is contra-intuitive in this
case: a pronoun introduces no lexical material
which serves for subsequent re-identification of a
referent. In order to respect the inter-subjective
intuition to identify the controller of the possessive
as a markable, we posit an exception to the chain
principle for the case of pronominal cataphora.
According to the CONSISTENCY requirement (see
3.1), any bound pronoun, no matter if its is chain-
initial or not, has to be treated this way.
Principle 4 Cataphora at sentence level
If a pronoun which is typically used as a bound
pronoun is bound by an intrasentential controller,
annotate a pointing relation to the controller rather
than to a candidate antecedent in previous dis-
course.
In the Core Scheme for German, English and
Russian, Principle 4 applies to possessive pronouns
only.

3.4 Identifying pointing relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997766">
A special case for annotation is pronominal or
nominal reference by plural or NPs or both to mul-
tiple concrete antecedents mentioned at different
points in a text. Thus, they cannot be regarded as
single constituent. Since a referent of a plural NP is
not the same as the sum of its parts, we deal with
multiple antecedents by introducing a separate an-
notation layer called groups. Group referents are
linked to their anaphors by regular anaphoric rela-
tions, see (5).

<bodyText confidence="0.999255736842105">
Special treatment of groups is important as they
introduce an exception to the Chain Principle.
Formally, the same group of people can be referred
to at different points of time. However, following
the preference for MAXIMAL ANALYSIS (see 3.1),
longer anaphoric chains are preferred, and thus,
once a pre-established group reference exists, it is
marked as an antecedent instead of establishing a
new group referent. Accordingly, in ex. (5), the
preferred antecedent of the second companies
is the previously established group reference The
companies. More generally, this is formulated in
Principle 5.
Principle 5 Maximize anaphoric chains
The annotation of anaphoric references is pre-
ferred over the annotation of alternative analy-
ses.
This principle is motivated by CONSISTENCY and
coverage considerations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999114">
4.1 Ambiguity resolution strategies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96205516">
The problem of identifying an appropriate pointing
relation is especially acute in connection with ana-
phoric ambiguity. As opposed to general annota-
tion strategies, however, the ambiguity strategies
apply only in case of doubt, i.e. if the annotator
perceives different readings as equally possible.
Consider ex. (6) as a continuation of ex. (4):
(6) Je kleiner [die Ki-
cker]u?/d? daherkommmen, desto
gr68er wird [der Gegner]d?/u?
geredet. (PCC, 10374)
„The smaller [the kickers]u?/d? are, the
greater [the rivals]d?/u? are rumoured to be.&amp;quot;
Antecedent of die Kicker &amp;quot;kickers&amp;quot; depends
on the understanding of the &amp;quot;size&amp;quot; metaphor, it can
be either the Ukrainian team (presented as having
short players), or the German team (which has not
been favored in the first match), or a generic
description (which would mean that the sentence is
not directly linked with the discourse). Here, also
Principle 5 can be applied, since we are facing
alternative readings, and accordingly, the generic
reading in the example is excluded. This
application of Principle 5 is reformulated in
Principle 6.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.368465">
Principle 6 Primacy of anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977395038461539">
In case of uncertainty between different read-
ings prefer anaphoric interpretation to antece-
dentless one.
However, in the example under consideration,
we still have the choice between two possible
antecedents. The substitution test (see Sec. 2)
fails to determine a unique antecedent, as both
possible substitutions are plausible, depending
on whether &amp;quot;size&amp;quot; refers to physical size or an-
ticipated defeat. From the preference for MAXI-
MAL ANALYSIS, however, a more rigid version
of Principle 5 can be motivated, cf. Principle 7.
Principle 7 Avoid ambiguous antecedents
In case of two possible antecedents, primary
markable is preferred to secondary ones or to
group referents.
In case of two primary markables are possible
antecedents, choose the one which leads to the
longer anaphoric chain.
In ex. (6), this results in a preference for the Ger-
man team as the antecedent of die Kicker.
Finally, in order to narrow down the scope of
ambiguity, another exception to the chain principle
is necessary. Markables with ambiguous reference
should be avoided as antecedents, but rather the
last unambiguously coreferential expression.

4.2 Annotation of ambiguities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993142">
In order to investigate the effect of ambiguity and
to document its influence on inter-annotator-
agreement, ambiguities are to be explicitly marked.
For this purpose, we classified ambiguities as fol-
lows.
Ambiguous antecedent ambiguity of antece-
dent of a markable, cf. (6).
Ambiguous relation ambiguity wrt relation be-
tween a markable and the context:

The relation between “the police” and “the po-
licemen” is either bridging (part-whole) or corefer-
ence.
Ambiguous idiomatic ambiguity wrt whether a
markable could be either understood as coreferen-
tial or as a part of an idiom. In (8), der Spatz in der
Hand, a definite NP in German, can be generic,
part of an idiom, or referring:

5 PoCoS annotation scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98962225">
PoCoS disposes of three annotation levels: mark-
ables, relations and attributes (5.1, 5.2. and 5.3). In
what follows, we concentrate on the Core Scheme
because of relevance and space considerations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.956197">
5.1 Markables
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921090909091">
Primary markables are all potential anaphors, i.e.
referential forms which can be used to indicate
subsequent mentions of a previously introduced
referent in the discourse, such as definite NPs, pro-
nouns, and proper names. Secondary markables are
expressions that normally indicates non-reference
(e.g. indefinites; in the Extended Scheme also
clauses). Secondary markables are subject to anno-
tation only if they serve as antecedents of a pri-
mary markable.
The basic distinctive feature between primary
and secondary markables is if they can refer to
previously mentioned nominals or not. Using the
above-mentioned grammatical criteria, most prob-
able referring expressions (i.e. primary markables)
can be extracted automatically from syntactic an-
notation, which is an important advantage.
Further, using this differentiation a more precise
definition of the coreference annotation task can be
given. Coreference annotation is complete, if all
primary markables are classified as having an an-
tecedent or not.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99777">
5.2 Coreference Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
We distinguish between two types of coreference:
nominal and non-nominal. The Core Scheme only
deals with nominal coreference, which we define
as reference of NPs to explicitly mentioned NPs
establishing a relation of identity (cf. Mitkov&apos;s
(2002) &amp;quot;identity-of-reference direct nominal
anaphora&amp;quot;). If a relation other than identity holds
between a primary markable and an element from
the preceding context, e.g. the bridging relation,
the relation remains underspecified and can be as-
signed later, as part of Extended Scheme.
Differently from MUC, we do not consider
predicative nominals as coreferential with the sub-
ject in the sense of textual coreference defined
above (for similar view, see van Deemter and Kib-
ble, 1999), as the relationship with the hypothetical
antecedent is expressed by syntactic means.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99936">
5.3 Annotation principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99924">
In sec. 3 and 4, we outlined a small set of heuris-
tics serving to guide annotators to more consistent
annotation decisions. These principles are, how-
ever, not equal in their restrictive force, but rather
they build the following preference hierarchy (cf.
Carlson et al., 2003):

Principles 1 and 2 are obligatory and do not allow
exceptions; 4, 5 and 8 are exceptions to the default,
i.e. the Chain Principle (3). 6 and 7 are applied
only if interpretation-dependent ambiguities occur,
thus being no exceptions to default principles.

5.4 Attributes

<bodyText confidence="0.999812705882353">
Markables and relations are enriched by a set of
additional features. These features encode attrib-
utes of pointing relations (e.g. anaphora type) or
specify parameters of anaphoricity (e.g. referential-
ity, ambiguity). Further, certain grammatical fea-
tures of markables are integrated which are of gen-
eral interest when analyzing patterns of anaphora
in corpora and can be extracted from other pre-
existing annotations. This way we gain a common
minimal representation of grammatical features
which can be extracted from different annotation
schemes. This allows us to abstract from language-
, tool- or annotation-specific expressions of, say,
grammatical roles. As a consequence, the scheme
is self-contained to a higher degree, and thus, the
cross-linguistic validity of the assembled data is
enhanced.

5.5. Annotation procedure

The scheme suggests structuring annotation into
several annotation cycles performed manually or
semi-automatically:

I. Core Scheme Annotation
1. Identify primary markables
2. Connect markables with coreference links

necessary
3. Set attribute values

<bodyText confidence="0.999846">
The original annotation guidelines were drafted in
2004 by the authors for the annotation of the Pots-
dam Commentary Corpus of German newspaper
commentaries (PCC) (Stede, 2004) and the RST
Discourse Treebank of Wall Street Journal articles
(WSJ) (Carlson et al., 2003).
After a series of annotation experiments, the
PoCoS Core Scheme was applied to the PCC by
two instructed annotators, students of linguistics,
whose portions had an overlap of 19 texts (11%).
Based upon these texts, inter-annotator agreement
was calculated using different agreement scores
along the methodology of Popescu-Belis et al.
(2004). So, with respect to German, we achieved
moderate to substantial agreement (full chains,
x=0.61 with union of markables; x=0.77 with in-
tersection of markables).
Part of the WSJ corpus has been performed in
co-operation with A.A. Kibrik, Moscow State Uni-
versity. Fourteen instructed annotators, also stu-
dents of linguistics, worked on the RST Discourse
Treebank with pair-wise overlapping portions. Re-
garding 8 texts from 6 annotators, we also found
substantial agreement (x=0.71 with union; x=0.96
with intersection).

These results are reasonable in the light of κ
values reported for an annotation experiment by
Artstein and Poesio (2005, p.22) on English which
yielded κ=0.48. However, κ is affected by parame-
ters of the text as a whole, and thus should be in-
terpreted with certain reservations. The texts of the
PCC are generally short, but very demanding in
their interpretation.
A detailed study of outliers revealed several
sources of errors in both corpora. Besides „soft
errors&amp;quot; such as inclusion of punctuation and con-
junctions within markables, occasionally missed
integration of function words into markables, or
obviously missed anaphors, we found several
„hard&amp;quot; errors on syntax (e.g. different assumptions
about PP attachment), semantics (e.g. vagueness,
exact relationship between abstract concepts in a
given context), and pragmatics (e.g. differentiation
between metonymy and bridging). Above, we sug-
gested the annotation of ambiguity as an attempt to
capture typical semantic and pragmatic sources of
disagreement (cf. sec. 4.2 for examples).
In order to evaluate the impact of such „hard er-
rors&amp;quot; in the German data, two instructed annotators
corrected 13 texts from the overlapping part of the
portions independently. As a concequence, the
original κ values increased by about 7%: original κ
= 0.69 (union)/0.82 (intersection), and corrected κ
=0.76 (union)/0.89 (intersection). These results,
however, still suffer from the special problems
with the demanding — though, very interesting —
type of texts assembled in the PCC as well.
Note that in spite of these short remarks, this
paper has focused on the presentation of the
scheme principles rather than on its evaluation.
Currently, the PCC is annotated with information

The majority of earlier coreference annotation ex-
periences were dealing with English, including the
standard-like MUC-scheme (Hirschman, 1997).
MATE was an attempt to extend annotation to
other languages than English (Poesio, 2004). For
German, several annotation schemes appeared and
were applied to annotation of corpora recently: for
newspaper texts, such as the TuBa-D/Z (Naumann,
2006) and for hypertexts, Holler et al. (2004). As
for Slavic languages, the Prague Dependency
Treebank has been recently enriched by corefer-
ence annotation, see Kučova and Hajičova (2004) .
For Russian, though, we are aware of no similar
experiences so far. The current approach is an ad-
vance on the existing work as it attempts at provid-
ing language-independent and systematic annota-
tion principles, including a language-neutral reper-
toire of relations and a language-neutral apparatus
for identification of markables. This makes the
resulting annotation scheme extendable and appli-
cable across languages.
The Core Scheme is comparable to MUC by
Hirschman, 1997; DRAMA by Passonneau, 1996;
MATE by Poesio, 2004. Its specific instantiations
formalized in a family of Extended Scheme(s) are
comparable to Rocha, 1997, GNOME by Poesio,
2004. By distinguishing between fundamental
(&amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot;), project-specific (&amp;quot;recommended&amp;quot;)
and language-specific (&amp;quot;optional&amp;quot;) levels of anno-
tation (cf. Leech and Wilson, 1996), a compromise
between a general character and a greater level of
detail is achieved.
A central innovation is the dichotomy of pri-
mary and secondary markables. As both are de-
fined on the basis of their syntactic properties, we
recommend identifying primary markables auto-
matically, but annotate secondary markables
manually and only if needed. The separation be-
tween both leads to a reduction of the number of
possible attribute values subject to annotation, and
thus to reduction of complexity. The definition of
primary and secondary markables makes use of
language-specifics such as existence of a definite
determiner, etc. These specifications, although
formulated here specifically for German and Eng-
lish, are subject to language-specific alternative
instantiations of the PoCoS Scheme. Note that in
Russian, the differentiation between primary and
secondary markables is made on the basis of dif-
ferent linguistic cues, as definiteness is not explic-
itly marked. Therefore, in Russian, secondary
markables are only certain quantified expressions.
Nevertheless, the function of primary and secon-
dary markables remains the same. Further, exis-
tence of a pre-determined set of potential anaphors
allows to verify if all primary markables are as-
signed a relation or have been explicitly marked as
non-referring.

Another important novel aspect is the systematic
treatment of ambiguity in the annotation of large
corpora. This aspect has never been included in
coreference annotation before (except for one ex-
periment described by Poesio and Artstein, 2005)
and thus defines the task of coreference annotation
in a more precise way. Moreover, we specified a
set of heuristic rules to guide an annotator to a spe-
cific decision in case of ambiguity or vagueness.
These rules are ranked according to their priority.
Similarly, Versley (2006) has recently argued that
a &amp;quot;light-weight theory&amp;quot; of anaphoric ambiguity is
due, in order to ensure consistent coding decisions.
Finally, splitting annotation procedure into
stages allows explicit structuring of the process, in
existing approaches presented no more than im-
plicitly (cf. Naumann, 2006, see p. 12).

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
This paper has presented the general coreference
annotation framework and the PoCoS Scheme for
coreference annotation. As an innovative feature
for coreference annotation, it implements ambigu-
ity resolution strategies and proposes annotation of
ambiguities. Also, by introducing language-neutral
criteria for identification of markables, it both re-
duces the notorious complexity of anaphoric anno-
tation on the systematic basis and enables applica-
bility of similar principles across languages. Thus,
it has a better portability and cross-language com-
parability as compared to the previous work. One
possible field of application of the scheme can be
seen in its utilisation for the anaphoric annotation
of parallel corpora, an idea which is currently ex-
plored by the authors.

We further suggest a clear and motivated structure of annotation stages, the separation of a coarse-grained core and a family of more elaborate extended schemes, and strategies for the systematic treatment of ambiguity.

Differently from MUC, we do not consider predicative nominals as coreferential with the subject in the sense of textual coreference defined above (for similar view, see van Deemter and Kibble, 1999), as the relationship with the hypothetical antecedent is expressed by syntactic means. 5.3 Annotation principles In sec. 3 and 4, we outlined a small set of heuristics serving to guide annotators to more consistent annotation decisions. These principles are, however, not equal in their restrictive force, but rather they build the following preference hierarchy (cf. Carlson et al., 2003): obligatory principles &gt; exception principles &gt; default principles &gt; ambiguity principles Principles 1 and 2 are obligatory and do not allow exceptions; 4, 5 and 8 are exceptions to the default, i.e. the Chain Principle (3). 6 and 7 are applied only if interpretation-dependent ambiguities occur, thus being no exceptions to default principles. 160 Figure 1.

Extended Scheme: steps 1 to 3 accordingly These stages correspond to the 3 annotation levels within the Core and Extended Schemes respectively, because annotating at all levels at the same time has proved to be very labor-intensive and more time-consuming than one level at a time. 6 Application and evaluation The original annotation guidelines were drafted in 2004 by the authors for the annotation of the Potsdam Commentary Corpus of German newspaper commentaries (PCC) (Stede, 2004) and the RST Discourse Treebank of Wall Street Journal articles (WSJ) (Carlson et al., 2003). After a series of annotation experiments, the PoCoS Core Scheme was applied to the PCC by two instructed annotators, students of linguistics, whose portions had an overlap of 19 texts (11%). Based upon these texts, inter-annotator agreement was calculated using different agreement scores along the methodology of Popescu-Belis et al. (2004). So, with respect to German, we achieved moderate to substantial agreement (full chains, x=0.61 with union of markables; x=0.77 with intersection of markables).

Semantically, these expressions are prototypical objects or &amp;quot;(discourse) referents&amp;quot; (Karttunen, 1976).

Coreference annotation consists of assignment of relations pointing from an anaphor to an antecedent markable. Whether two markables are co-referent, i.e. referring to the same discourse referent, can be determined by a substitution test.

As both are defined on the basis of their syntactic properties, we recommend identifying primary markables automatically, but annotate secondary markables manually and only if needed. The separation between both leads to a reduction of the number of possible attribute values subject to annotation, and thus to reduction of complexity.

A corpus of Russian is currently under construction, which PoCoS is being applied to (cf. Krasavina et al. 2007). 7 Discussion The majority of earlier coreference annotation experiences were dealing with English, including the standard-like MUC-scheme (Hirschman, 1997). MATE was an attempt to extend annotation to other languages than English (Poesio, 2004). For German, several annotation schemes appeared and were applied to annotation of corpora recently: for newspaper texts, such as the TuBa-D/Z (Naumann, 2006) and for hypertexts, Holler et al. (2004). As for Slavic languages, the Prague Dependency Treebank has been recently enriched by coreference annotation, see Kučova and Hajičova (2004) . For Russian, though, we are aware of no similar experiences so far.

Moreover, we specified a set of heuristic rules to guide an annotator to a specific decision in case of ambiguity or vagueness. These rules are ranked according to their priority. Similarly, Versley (2006) has recently argued that a &amp;quot;light-weight theory&amp;quot; of anaphoric ambiguity is due, in order to ensure consistent coding decisions. Finally, splitting annotation procedure into stages allows explicit structuring of the process, in existing approaches presented no more than implicitly (cf. Naumann, 2006, see p. 12). 8 Conclusion This paper has presented the general coreference annotation framework and the PoCoS Scheme for coreference annotation. As an innovative feature for coreference annotation, it implements ambiguity resolution strategies and proposes annotation of ambiguities. Also, by introducing language-neutral criteria for identification of markables, it both reduces the notorious complexity of anaphoric annotation on the systematic basis and enables applicability of similar principles across languages. Thus, it has a better portability and cross-language comparability as compared t</context>

The MUC is still generally accepted as the most standard-like annotation scheme (Hirschman, 1997). Given its simplicity is its most important advantage, it has been criticized for its limited coverage and its contra-intuitive understanding of coreference. One of the most wellknown later approaches is MATE/GNOME (Poesio, 2004). As the author fairly notices, &amp;quot;there can be no such thing as a general-purpose anaphoric annotation instructions&amp;quot;, due to the complexity of phenomena associated with the term of anaphora. So, its essential idea is combining a &amp;quot;generalpurporse markup scheme&amp;quot; (MATE) with application-specific scheme instantiations (GNOME). In PoCoS, we adapted and elaborated this idea, by suggesting the Core and Extended Schemes. The PoCoS, the Potsdam Coreference Scheme, both adapts selected features of existing schemes and implements a set of innovative features. We distinguish between the Core and Extended S</context>

Therefore, in Russian, secondary markables are only certain quantified expressions. Nevertheless, the function of primary and secondary markables remains the same. Further, existence of a pre-determined set of potential anaphors allows to verify if all primary markables are assigned a relation or have been explicitly marked as non-referring. 162 Another important novel aspect is the systematic treatment of ambiguity in the annotation of large corpora. This aspect has never been included in coreference annotation before (except for one experiment described by Poesio and Artstein, 2005) and thus defines the task of coreference annotation in a more precise way.

After a series of annotation experiments, the PoCoS Core Scheme was applied to the PCC by two instructed annotators, students of linguistics, whose portions had an overlap of 19 texts (11%). Based upon these texts, inter-annotator agreement was calculated using different agreement scores along the methodology of Popescu-Belis et al. (2004). So, with respect to German, we achieved moderate to substantial agreement (full chains, x=0.61 with union of markables; x=0.77 with intersection of markables). Part of the WSJ corpus has been performed in co-operation with A.A. Kibrik, Moscow State University. Fourteen instructed annotators, also students of linguistics, worked on the RST Discourse Treebank with pair-wise overlapping portions.
