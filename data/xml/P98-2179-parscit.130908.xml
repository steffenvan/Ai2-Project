Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99995125">
This paper demonstrates that generating
arguments in natural language requires
planning at an abstract level, and that the
appropriate abstraction cannot be captured
by approaches based solely upon coherence
relations. An abstraction based planning
system is presented which employs
operators motivated by empirical study and
rhetorical maxims. These operators include a
subset of traditional deductive rules of
inference, argumentation theoretic rules of
refutation, and inductive reasoning patterns.
The paper presents a unified system in
which the• various argument forms are
employed in generating rich, complex
structures for persuasive text.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999009375">
The ability to generate arguments in natural
language is attracting wide-ranging research
interest, and it is becoming clear that the
problem is also stimulating investigation of a
number of problems of importance to natural
language generation (NLG) as a whole (Reed
and Long, 1997a). Argumentation is particularly
appropriate as an NLG problem both because it
is more highly structured than other forms of
natural language, and because there are a variety
of established metrics developed in rhetoric and
social psychology for judging the resultant
quality of a text. These advantages are being
exploited in the design and implementation of
the Rketotica system, of which the current work
forms a part.

1 Problems with RST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996802097560976">
A number of limitations of the generative
capacity of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
(Mann and Thompson, 1988) have recently been
identified — most notably, its inability to
adequately handle intention (Moore and Paris,
1994). Through investigation of a particular
genre — persuasive text — it has become clear that
RST suffers from a much wider catalogue of
crippling restrictions, severely limiting its
applicability to generation in this genre and
questioning its suitability elsewhere.
Mann and Thompson discuss the key
role played by the notion of nuclearity — that
relations hold between one nucleus and one
satellite. They do, however, concede (p269) that
there are a few cases in which nuclearity breaks
down — and these they regard as rather unusual.
The two types of multi-nuclear constructs they
identify are enveloping structures — &amp;quot;texts with
conventional openings and closings&amp;quot; and
parallel structures — &amp;quot;texts in which parallelism
is the dominant organising pattern&amp;quot;. Both of
these are not just common in argument, but form
key components. Enveloping structures are
precisely what are described by, for example,
Blair (1838) (citing Cicero), when presenting the
dissection of argument into introduction,
proposition, division, narration, argumentative,
pathetic and conclusion (these are by no means
obligatory in every argument, nor is there any
great consensus over this particular
characterisation; most authors, however, would
agree that some such gross structure, usually
involving introduction and conclusion, is
appropriate). These structures are found with
great frequency in natural argument, and cannot,
therefore, be ignored. Parallel structures form
the very basis of argument, since only the most
trivial will involve lines of reasoning in which a
single premise supports a single conclusion.
Multiple subarguments conjoined to support a

<bodyText confidence="0.999510539215686">
conclusion are the norm (see for example,
Cohen (1987), Reed and Long, 1997b), and
these necessarily form parallel structures.
Another shortcoming is highlighted by a
dissonance between RST and argument analysis
(see Eemeren et al. (1996) for a review). A
given text may be amenable to multiple RST
analyses — not just as a result of ambiguity, but
because there are, at a fundamental level,
&amp;quot;multiple compatible analyses&amp;quot;. This contrasts
with the view in argumentation theory, where
one argument has a single, unequivocal
structure. There may, of course, be practical
problems in identifying this structure, and two
analysts may disagree on the most appropriate
analysis (and indeed this latter has a close
parallel in RST, since different analysts are at
liberty to make different &apos;plausibility
judgements&apos; as to the aims of the speaker). The
presence of these problems, however, is not
equivalent to claiming that arguments may
simply have more than one structure, a claim
which would pose insurmountable problems to
the evaluation process (- argumentation theory
aims to determine a means of classifying an
argument as either good or bad, and the presence
of inherent structural multiplicity would present
the possibility of an argument being
simultaneously good and bad).
Finally, there is a more intuitive problem
with RST, highlighted by analysing argument
structure. Although there is much debate over
the number and range of rhetorical relations (e.g.
Hovy, 1993) there seems to be no way of
dealing with the idea of argumentative support.
In the first place, as Snoeck-Henkemans (1997)
points out, Motivation, Evidence, Justification,
Cause, Solutionhood and other relations could
all be used argumentatively (as well, of course,
as being applicable in non-argumentative
situations). Elhadad (1992) draws a similar
conclusion (though his list of potentially
argumentative relations is somewhat shorter).
Thus it is impossible to identify an
argumentative relation on the basis of RST
alone. Secondly, RST offers no way of capturing
higher level organisational units, such as Modus
Ponens, Modus Toliens, and so on. For although
their structure (or at least the structure of any
one instance) can be represented in RST — and,
given Marcu&apos;s (1996) elegant extensions, even
their hierarchical use in larger units — adopting
this approach necessitates a lower level view. It
becomes impossible to represent and employ a
Modus Toliens subargument supporting the
antecedent of a Modus Ponens — rather, the
situation can only be characterised as P
supporting through one of the potentially
argumentative RST relations Q, and showing
that —Q, so —P, and —P then supporting through
one of the potentially argumentative RST
relations R, therefore R. Apart from being
obviously cumbersome, the representation has
lost the abstract structure of the argument
altogether, and is not generalisable and
comparable to other similar argument structures.
(It could perhaps be maintained that such
structures could be represented as RST schemas,
but there are several problems with such an
approach: in the first place, schemas cannot
abstract from individual relations, so there
would need to be a separate &apos;Modus Ponens&apos;
schema for each possible argumentative support
relation; furthermore, the optionality and
repetition rules of schema application (Mann
and Thomson, 1988, p248) are not suited to
argument, as they license the creation of
incoherent argument structure).
It is for these reasons, and particularly,
the last, that although RST plays an important
role in the current work, it is subsumed by a
layer which explicitly represents argumentative
constructs. These constructs can be mapped on
to the most appropriate set of RST relations
(thus, for example, the implicature in an MP
may be realised into any one of the potentially
argumentative relations mentioned above). The
approach thus maintains the generative
capabilities of RST (particularly when extended
along the lines of Marcu (1996) to ensure
coherency through adducement of canonical
ordering constraints), whilst embracing the
intuitive argumentative relationships at a more
abstract level. It is these latter relationships
which characterise the structure of the argument
(i.e. the structure which argumentation theory
strives to determine). The relationships are also
unambiguous: a single argument has exactly one
structure at this level abstraction (though
multiplicity is not thereby prevented at the RST
level). Further, parallelism occurs only at the
higher level of abstraction (multiple
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.977902">
1092
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990470588235">
subarguments contribute to a conclusion, but
each subargument is mononucleaic), and
similarly, enveloping structures are also
characterised only at the higher level (thus the
RST is restricted to a predominantly
mononucleaic structure). Finally, complete
argument texts are not obliged to have complete
RST trees. For although most parts of a text are
likely to have unifying RST analyses, and
although there must be a single overarching
structure at the highest level of abstraction, the
refinement to RST need not enforce the
introduction of rhetorical relations between
parts. This expands the flexibility and generative
capacity of the system encompassing a greater
proportion of coherent arguments (including, for
example, those found in laws and contracts).

2 Abstraction-Based Planning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960414634146">
The structure of argument is thus planned at a
level more abstract than RST. To exploit the
intrinsic hierarchical structuring of argument,
the current work makes use of AbNLP (Fox and
Long, 1995), a hierarchical planner based upon
the concept of encapsulation, whereby the body
of an abstract operator contains goals rather than
operators, and further, that the body of an
operator is not opened up until an entire abstract
plan has been completed (i.e. there are no goals
left unfulfilled at that level of abstraction). On
completion of an abstract plan (which can be
seen, in discourse planning, as a skeletal outline
of what is to be communicated), the refinement
operation opens up all the abstract operator
bodies, such that the structure and constraints
determined at one level of abstraction are
propagated to the next level down. As a
consequence, many choices which might have
been considered during planning of an argument
at the detailed level can be pruned as they
become inconsistent with the abstract plan. Such
an approach has the potential to considerably
improve upon the performance of a classical
planner, (Bacchus and Yang, 1992). The use of
AbNLP in a framework for argumentative
discourse planning is discussed in more detail in
Reed et al. (1996).
The operators employed by AbNLP
utilise a highly parsimonious set of intentional
goals. Belief goals are used to build the content
of an argument (as in much other NLG work);
saliency goals to express the intention to convey
information to the hearer (following a notion of
saliency similar to that proposed in Walker,
1996); and topic manipulation goals to control
the focus of attention through the discourse. The
roles of these goals and their interrelationships
are explored in relation to the information-
intention-attention model of Grosz and Sidner
(1986) in more detail in Reed and Long (1997a).

3 Deductive Operators
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999794052631579">
The choice of operators implemented in
the Rfietorica system has been influenced by a
number of factors. The rules of inference are
clear candidates for operationalisation: moves
such as Modus Ponens are clearly vital
components of any argument - though, as noted
in Grosz and Sidner (1986), p201, it is
inappropriate to view the implication step as one
of conventional material implication. The
relationship is rather one of support — the hearer
must be brought to believe that (given the
current context and domain of discourse) the
first proposition warrants, in part, concluding the
second. Even given this weaker, predicate-based
reading of a Modus Ponens argument, it is still
unclear that any of the other rules of inference
(which are, after all, formally redundant) should
be necessary. The answer lies in the second
consideration, which is entirely empirical — the
reason that the argument planning needs to be
able to employ other rules of inference is that
such argument forms occur naturally. Modus
Tollens, for example, is perfectly common, with
numerous (real world) examples in
argumentation texts such as Fisher (1988).
Further, there is a variety of evidence which
suggests that Modus Tollens in fact occupies a
crucial position in human reasoning (Ohlsson
and Robin (1994) cite examples not only from
psychology, artificial intelligence and empirical
observation, but also by reference to classic
examples of Euclid, Galileo, etc.)
Disjunctive Syllogisms are also found
reasonably often, but the remaining rules of
inference are found very rarely. For this reason,
only the three logical argument forms, MP, MT
and DS, are currently implemented.
The three deductive operators are shown

in Figure 1 (the orderings constraining the body
goals — enforcing initial and terminal positions
for PUSH_TOPIC and POP_TOPIC respectively —
are omitted for clarity). The preconditions on
each operator act as filters on their applicability
(so that, for example, the version of MP shown
is only applicable for the situation in which the
hearer believes the negation of the conclusion).
The body is bounded by the topic manipulators
which take as a parameter the topic for the
current argument, of the form arg (X, P), a
generic expression representing an argument
concluding P using a premise X (used to abstract
from Modus Ponens, Modus Toliens, etc.). The
saliency goals also employ the same context
parameter: this is used at a later stage to ensure a
basic level of coherency (by placing utterances
within the appropriate focus space) — discussion
of this mechanism is beyond the scope of this
paper. Finally, the operator bodies also include
goals of belief which are satisfied (after
refinement) by further applications of the
operators (e.g. the goal ti in a given MP could
be fulfilled by an MT)

4 Refutation operators
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999575521739131">
In addition to these deductive operators,
Rhetorica also employs pseudo-deductive
operators, by means of which counter-
counterargumentation structures can be
developed. The importance of including such
refutation in an argument has been conclusively
demonstrated in social psychology (Hovland,
1957). The operators required to effect the
generation of such structure are closely related
to the notions of conflict explored by Haggith
(1996), and draw upon the distinction between
rebutting and undercutting counterarguments,
identified in (Toulmin, 1958). Given the
situation portrayed in Figure 2, in which the
speaker believes p because of a, and also
disbelieves b because of d and e, and the hearer
believes —p supported by b and c, a number of
options are available to the speaker. The
conventional MP operator discussed above can
be employed to support p by a — this is rebuttal.
In addition, the hearer&apos;s belief in —p can be
undercut by arguing against one of its supports,
namely, b.

There are thus no new operators for
rebutting, since those in Figure I already fulfil
that role. Undercutting, however, requires two
new operators, one which characterises a
refutation of a premise (UCP), and one which
characterises a refutation of the validity of an
inference (UCI). The operator definitions are
shown below in Figure 3.
There are several points to note about
these definitions. First, that they are fairly loose,
since the speaker is not obliged to believe the
falsity of the hearer&apos;s premise, merely be able to
persuade the hearer of that falsity (though the
speaker is somewhat constrained by rules of
terminal goal fulfilment — in particular, the

any means other than substantial support).
Secondly, in the UCP operator, it is necessary to
make sure that the hearer is aware that the
premise supports his conclusion — but clearly,
the speaker doesn&apos;t want to offer any further
support for the inference, hence the absence of a
belief goal corresponding to IS_SALIENT (Ag , X
-4 P. arg (-X, P) ) . Lastly, a similar issue faces
the UCI operator — the tl goal expresses the
need to make the premise salient before
attacking it. Indeed, stating counterarguments is
the key to counter-counterargumentation: just
mentioning a counterargument can bolster a
claim. The goal is particularly interesting both
from a realisation point of view (where
information can be exploited that x is being
made salient in the context of an argument from
—x), and an ordering point of view (whether or
not statement should precede refutation, and
then whether or not UCP/I argumentation should
precede pro support is a major issue of debate in
psychology, Hass and Linder, 1972).
The deductive operators, however, do
not offer the full range of argument forms found
in natural text. One major omission is the class
of inductive operators, including analogy,
inductive generalisation, and causal relation. The
framework is designed to admit all these
operators, but the current work concentrates
upon inductive generalisation.
Inductive generalisation (IG) is of
particular interest for a number of reasons. The
first is the frequency with which various naively
statistical and probabilistic arguments are
employed in natural language. More
importantly, though, are the problems faced in
argumentation theoretic analyses of inductive
generalisation. Freeman (1991) examines the
problems in depth, and, building on Toulmin&apos;s
work (1958), and its criticisms, comes to a well
justified conclusion that IG should be treated as
a convergent arrangement. His argument rests
largely on the distinction between the &apos;ground
adequacy&apos; and &apos;relevance&apos; questions: in
analysing any argument as dialogical, the analyst
can look at any two premises and infer that some
imaginary opponent had asked a question after
the first premise to elicit the second. If that
question was &apos;Can you give me another reason?&apos;
(ground adequacy), the resulting structure is
convergent, whereas if that question was &apos;Why
does the premise support the conclusion?&apos;
(relevance), the resulting structure is linked. An
inductive generalisation is thus based on a
number of premises between which an
imaginary opponent continually asks the ground
adequacy question. The reason, Freeman claims,
that inductive generalisation may be intuitively
mistaken for a linked structure is that each
premise in itself lends only very weak support to
the conclusion, and that this generally results in
assumption of linkage. Freeman&apos;s work and its
relation to other accounts of linked and
convergent argumentation is explored more fully
in (Reed and Long, 1997b).
In following Freeman&apos;s attractive
account of IG, it may appear that the required
convergent structure can be fully accounted for
in the existing framework, by allowing the
standard iterative fulfilment of goals of belief
discussed (Reed and Long, 1997a). However,
Freeman&apos;s account, because it is analytic, omits
the rather obvious fact that premises in an IG
have something in common with each other and
with the conclusion. That a premise in an IG is
related to the conclusion in some respect cannot
be handled simply by iterating through all
available supports for an argument, since there is
no way to select all and only those premises
which support the conclusion in the given
respect. Furthermore, it is important that the IG
itself is seen as a unit, since it is quite
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.984944">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999711875">
inappropriate for subsequent ordering heuristics
to be at liberty to intersperse various deductive
premises for a conclusion in the midst of the
inductive premises (or further, that if there exist
two or more IGs supporting the same conclusion
— each employing a different common attribute —
it is inappropriate to mix premises from the
various arguments). Seeing the whole IG as a
unit enables appropriate scoping for reordering:
the premises within the unit can be reordered
wholly within the unit, and the unit itself can be
moved around wholesale with respect to the
other premises. An IG is thus viewed in the
current work as a premise. This is illustrated in
the diagrammatic argument notation as a
phantom node, as shown in Figure 4.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910142857143">
Thus the IG premise phantom node is generated
along with all the other premises for a given
conclusion. Then, after refinement, the
individual premises within the inductive
argument are determined, occurring concurrently
with identification of supports for the other
premises which are at the level of the inductive
generalisation. In the scenario illustrated in
Figure 4, for example, the first round of
planning identifies that there are three supports
for the conclusion p, namely, a Modus Ponens
argument from each of b and c, and an inductive
generalisation. After an appropriate order is
determined for these three, refinement opens up
the bodies of the operators, and the supports for
b and c are identified, and the inductive
generalisation is fleshed out to include al
through a„. The process of building an inductive
generalisation thus involves two different
operators: the IG operator, which identifies that
an inductive generalisation is appropriate, and
the ISUP operator, which is used to select each
inductive premise. To prevent an inductive
generalisation from being considered at every
turn, the precondition list on IG states that there
must exist at least one premise which can be
used inductively - this is a bare minimum since
an inductive generalisation employing a single
premise is clearly very weak. Strengthening the
notion of inductive generalisation is a trivial task
of increasing the minimum number of premises
which must exist for the application of IG to be
licensed.
The complete definitions for IG and
ISUP are given below in Figure 5.

related work, this abstract structure is often lost
— certainly in coherence relation based NLG
(such as operational RST), but also in (Elhadad,
1992) (which captures some, but not all of the
commonly found argument structures) and in
(Maybury, 1993) (which fails to capture the
hierarchical nature of argument).
Evaluation of non-task-oriented NLG is
difficult, particularly when the output is not text,
but a plan of primitive operators. However,
several evaluative observations support the
approach. First, though only touched upon here,
the planning process produces a partially
specified plan in which the underspecification is
precisely that licensed by Cohen-like constraints
on argument coherency (Reed and Long, 1997a)
appropriated from empirical studies in
argumentation theory. Furthermore, the
approach enables these coherency constraints to
be expressed in a tractable way. Finally, a
comparison of system output with natural
arguments (of equivalent propositional content)
in a small corpus suggests that the constraints of
coherency discussed here do indeed ensure the
generation of coherent argument structures, and
that the interplay between them and constraints
of persuasive effect facilitate the construction of
natural language arguments which are both

<abstract confidence="0.998104352941176">This paper demonstrates that generating arguments in natural language requires planning at an abstract level, and that the appropriate abstraction cannot be captured by approaches based solely upon coherence relations. An abstraction based planning system is presented which employs operators motivated by empirical study and rhetorical maxims. These operators include a subset of traditional deductive rules of inference, argumentation theoretic rules of refutation, and inductive reasoning patterns. The paper presents a unified system in which the• various argument forms are employed in generating rich, complex structures for persuasive text.</abstract>

As a consequence, many choices which might have been considered during planning of an argument at the detailed level can be pruned as they become inconsistent with the abstract plan. Such an approach has the potential to considerably improve upon the performance of a classical planner, (Bacchus and Yang, 1992). The use of AbNLP in a framework for argumentative discourse planning is discussed in more detail in Reed et al. (1996). The operators employed by AbNLP utilise a highly parsimonious set of intentional goals. Belief goals are used to build the content of an argument (as in much other NLG work); saliency goals to express the intention to convey information to the hearer (following a notion of saliency similar to that proposed in Walker, 1996); and topic manipulation goals to control the focus of attention through the discourse.

Finally, there is a more intuitive problem with RST, highlighted by analysing argument structure. Although there is much debate over the number and range of rhetorical relations (e.g. Hovy, 1993) there seems to be no way of dealing with the idea of argumentative support. In the first place, as Snoeck-Henkemans (1997) points out, Motivation, Evidence, Justification, Cause, Solutionhood and other relations could all be used argumentatively (as well, of course, as being applicable in non-argumentative situations). Elhadad (1992) draws a similar conclusion (though his list of potentially argumentative relations is somewhat shorter). Thus it is impossible to identify an argumentative relation on the basis of RST alone. Secondly, RST offers no way of capturing higher level organisational units, such as Modus Ponens, Modus Toliens, and so on. For although their structure (or at least the structure of any one instance) can be represented in RST — and, given Marcu&apos;s (1996) elegant extensions, even their hierarchical use in larger units — adopting this approach necessitates a lower level view. It becomes impossible to repre</context>

It is not necessary to introduce a new notion of support. Conclusion This paper has presented a number of features of the Rketorica system, and has introduced the deductive, refutation and inductive generalisation operators which are employed to generate the abstract structure of an argument. In ) phantom node 1096 related work, this abstract structure is often lost — certainly in coherence relation based NLG (such as operational RST), but also in (Elhadad, 1992) (which captures some, but not all of the commonly found argument structures) and in (Maybury, 1993) (which fails to capture the hierarchical nature of argument). Evaluation of non-task-oriented NLG is difficult, particularly when the output is not text, but a plan of primitive operators. However, several evaluative observations support the approach. First, though only touched upon here, the planning process produces a partially specified plan in which the underspecification is precisely that licensed by Cohen-like constraints on argument coherency (Reed and Long, 1997a) appropriated from empi</context>

Even given this weaker, predicate-based reading of a Modus Ponens argument, it is still unclear that any of the other rules of inference (which are, after all, formally redundant) should be necessary. The answer lies in the second consideration, which is entirely empirical — the reason that the argument planning needs to be able to employ other rules of inference is that such argument forms occur naturally. Modus Tollens, for example, is perfectly common, with numerous (real world) examples in argumentation texts such as Fisher (1988). Further, there is a variety of evidence which suggests that Modus Tollens in fact occupies a crucial position in human reasoning (Ohlsson and Robin (1994) cite examples not only from psychology, artificial intelligence and empirical observation, but also by reference to classic examples of Euclid, Galileo, etc.) Disjunctive Syllogisms are also found reasonably often, but the remaining rules of inference are found very rarely. For this reason, only the three logical argument forms, MP, MT and DS, are currently implemented. The three deductive operators are shown 1093 MP (Ag, X, P) Shell: Prec</context>

This expands the flexibility and generative capacity of the system encompassing a greater proportion of coherent arguments (including, for example, those found in laws and contracts). 2 Abstraction-Based Planning The structure of argument is thus planned at a level more abstract than RST. To exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structuring of argument, the current work makes use of AbNLP (Fox and Long, 1995), a hierarchical planner based upon the concept of encapsulation, whereby the body of an abstract operator contains goals rather than operators, and further, that the body of an operator is not opened up until an entire abstract plan has been completed (i.e. there are no goals left unfulfilled at that level of abstraction). On completion of an abstract plan (which can be seen, in discourse planning, as a skeletal outline of what is to be communicated), the refinement operation opens up all the abstract operator bodies, such that the structure and constraints determined at one level of abstract</context>

The first is the frequency with which various naively statistical and probabilistic arguments are employed in natural language. More importantly, though, are the problems faced in argumentation theoretic analyses of inductive generalisation. Freeman (1991) examines the problems in depth, and, building on Toulmin&apos;s work (1958), and its criticisms, comes to a well justified conclusion that IG should be treated as a convergent arrangement. His argument rests largely on the distinction between the &apos;ground adequacy&apos; and &apos;relevance&apos; questions: in analysing any argument as dialogical, the analyst can look at any two premises and infer that some imaginary opponent had asked a question after the first premise to elicit the second. If that question was &apos;Can you give me another reason?&apos; (ground adequacy), the resulting structure is convergent, whereas if </context>

The importance of including such refutation in an argument has been conclusively demonstrated in social psychology (Hovland, 1957). The operators required to effect the generation of such structure are closely related to the notions of conflict explored by Haggith (1996), and draw upon the distinction between rebutting and undercutting counterarguments, identified in (Toulmin, 1958).

It is for these reasons, and particularly, the last, that although RST plays an important role in the current work, it is subsumed by a layer which explicitly represents argumentative constructs. These constructs can be mapped on to the most appropriate set of RST relations (thus, for example, the implicature in an MP may be realised into any one of the potentially argumentative relations mentioned above). The approach thus maintains the generative capabilities of RST (particularly when extended along the lines of Marcu (1996) to ensure coherency through adducement of canonical ordering constraints), whilst embracing the intuitive argumentative relationships at a more abstract level. It is these latter relationships which characterise the structure of the argument (i.e. the structure which argumentation theory strives to determine). The relationships are also unambiguous: a single argument has exactly one structure at this level abstraction (though multiplicity is not thereby prevented at the RST level). Further, parallelism occurs only at the higher level of abstraction (multiple 1092 subarguments contribute to a </context>

It is not necessary to introduce a new notion of support. Conclusion This paper has presented a number of features of the Rketorica system, and has introduced the deductive, refutation and inductive generalisation operators which are employed to generate the abstract structure of an argument. In ) phantom node 1096 related work, this abstract structure is often lost — certainly in coherence relation based NLG (such as operational RST), but also in (Elhadad, 1992) (which captures some, but not all of the commonly found argument structures) and in (Maybury, 1993) (which fails to capture the hierarchical nature of argument). Evaluation of non-task-oriented NLG is difficult, particularly when the output is not text, but a plan of primitive operators. However, several evaluative observations support the approach. First, though only touched upon here, the planning process produces a partially specified plan in which the underspecification is precisely that licensed by Cohen-like constraints on argument coherency (Reed and Long, 1997a) appropriated from empirical studies in argumentation theory. Furthermore, the approach enables these coherency constraints</context>

The answer lies in the second consideration, which is entirely empirical — the reason that the argument planning needs to be able to employ other rules of inference is that such argument forms occur naturally. Modus Tollens, for example, is perfectly common, with numerous (real world) examples in argumentation texts such as Fisher (1988). Further, there is a variety of evidence which suggests that Modus Tollens in fact occupies a crucial position in human reasoning (Ohlsson and Robin (1994) cite examples not only from psychology, artificial intelligence and empirical observation, but also by reference to classic examples of Euclid, Galileo, etc.) Disjunctive Syllogisms are also found reasonably often, but the remaining rules of inference are found very rarely. For this reason, only the three logical argument forms, MP, MT and DS, are currently implemented. The three deductive operators are shown 1093 MP (Ag, X, P) Shell: Precond: X, (X -3 P) BEL (Ag, -P) Add: BEL (Ag, P) Body: Goals: tO:PUSH_TOPIC(arg(X,P)) tl:BEL(Ag, X) t2:IS_SALIENT(Ag,X,arg(X,P)) t3:BEL(Ag, X -)P) t4:IS_SALIE</context>

Finally, there is a more intuitive problem with RST, highlighted by analysing argument structure. Although there is much debate over the number and range of rhetorical relations (e.g. Hovy, 1993) there seems to be no way of dealing with the idea of argumentative support. In the first place, as Snoeck-Henkemans (1997) points out, Motivation, Evidence, Justification, Cause, Solutionhood and other relations could all be used argumentatively (as well, of course, as being applicable in non-argumentative situations). Elhadad (1992) draws a similar conclusion (though his list of potentially argumentative relations is somewhat shorter). Thus it is impossible to identify an argumentative relation on the basis of RST alone. Secondly, RST offers no way of capturing higher level organisational units, such as Modus Ponens, Modus Toliens, and so on.

The importance of including such refutation in an argument has been conclusively demonstrated in social psychology (Hovland, 1957). The operators required to effect the generation of such structure are closely related to the notions of conflict explored by Haggith (1996), and draw upon the distinction between rebutting and undercutting counterarguments, identified in (Toulmin, 1958). Given the situation portrayed in Figure 2, in which the speaker believes p because of a, and also disbelieves b because of d and e, and the hearer believes —p supported by b and c, a number of options are available to the speaker. The conventional MP operator discussed above can be employed to support p by a — this is rebuttal. In addition, the hearer&apos;s belief in —p can be undercut by arguing against one of its supports, namely, b. Figure 2.
