Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997156875">
This paper addresses the problem of ex-
tracting the most important facts from a
news article. Our approach uses syntac-
tic, semantic, and general statistical fea-
tures to identify the most important sen-
tences in a document. The importance
of the individual features is estimated us-
ing generalized iterative scaling methods
trained on an annotated newswire corpus.
The performance of our approach is evalu-
ated against 300 unseen news articles and
shows that use of these features results in
statistically significant improvements over
a provenly robust baseline, as measured
using metrics such as precision, recall and
ROUGE.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999983824561404">
The increasing amount of information that is avail-
able to both professional users (such as journal-
ists, financial analysts and intelligence analysts)
and lay users has called for methods condensing
information, in order to make the most important
content stand out. Several methods have been pro-
posed over the last two decades, among which
keyword extraction and summarization are the
most prominent ones. Keyword extraction aims
to identify the most relevant words or phrases in
a document, e.g., (Witten et al., 1999), while sum-
marization aims to provide a short (commonly 100
words), coherent full-text summary of the docu-
ment, e.g., (McKeown et al., 1999). Key fact ex-
traction falls in between key word extraction and
summarization. Here, the challenge is to identify
the most relevant facts in a document, but not nec-
essarily in a coherent full-text form as is done in
summarization.
Evidence of the usefulness of key fact extraction
is CNN’s web site which since 2006 has most of its
news articles preceded by a list of story highlights,
see Figure 1. The advantage of the news highlights
as opposed to full-text summaries is that they are
much ‘easier on the eye’ and are better suited for
quick skimming.
So far, only CNN.com offers this service and we
are interested in finding out to what extent it can
be automated and thus applied to any newswire
source. Although these highlights could be eas-
ily generated by the respective journalists, many
news organization shy away from introducing an
additional manual stage into the workflow, where
pushback times of minutes are considered unac-
ceptable in an extremely competitive news busi-
ness which competes in terms of seconds rather
than minutes. Automating highlight generation
can help eliminate those delays.
Journalistic training emphasizes that news arti-
cles should contain the most important informa-
tion in the beginning, while less important infor-
mation, such as background or additional details,
appears further down in the article. This is also
the main reason why most summarization systems
applied to news articles do not outperform a sim-
ple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an
article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005).
On the other hand, most of CNN’s story high-
lights are not taken from the beginning of the ar-
ticles. In fact, more than 50% of the highlights
stem from sentences that are not among the first
100 words of the articles. This makes identify-
ing story highlights a much more challenging task
than single-document summarization in the news
domain.
In order to automate story highlight identifica-
tion we automatically extract syntactic, semantic,

and purely statistical features from the document.
The weights of the features are estimated using
machine learning techniques, trained on an anno-
tated corpus. In this paper, we focus on identify-
ing the relevant sentences in the news article from
which the highlights were generated. The system
we have implemented is named AURUM: AUto-
matic Retrieval of Unique information with Ma-
chine learning. A full system would also contain
a sentence compression step (Knight and Marcu,
2000), but since both steps are largely indepen-
dent of each other, existing sentence compression
or simplification techniques can be applied to the
sentences identified by our approach.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: The next section describes the relevant work
done to date in keyfact extraction and automatic
summarization. Section 3 lays out our features
and explains how they were learned and estimated.
Section 4 presents the experimental setup and our
results, and Section 5 concludes with a short dis-
cussion.

As mentioned above, the problem of identifying
story highlight lies somewhere between keyword
extraction and single-document summarization.
The KEA keyphrase extraction system (Witten
et al., 1999) mainly relies on purely statistical
features such as term frequencies, using the tf.idf
measure from Information Retrieval,1 as well as
on a term’s position in the text. In addition to tf.idf
scores, Hulth (2004) uses part-of-speech tags and
NP chunks and complements this with machine
learning; the latter has been used to good results
in similar cases (Turney, 2000; Neto et al., 2002).
The B&amp;C system (Barker and Cornacchia, 2000),
also used linguistic methods to a very limited ex-
tent, identifying NP heads.
INFORMATIONFINDER (Krulwich and Burkey,
1996) requires user feedback to train the system,
whereby a user notes whether a given document
is of interest to them and specifies their own key-
words which are then learned by the system.
Over the last few years, numerous single-
as well as multi-document summarization ap-
proaches have been developed. In this paper we
will focus mainly on single-document summariza-
tion as it is more relevant to the issue we aim to
address and traditionally proves harder to accom-
plish. A good example of a powerful approach is
a method named Maximum Marginal Relevance
which extracts a sentence for the summary only
if it is different than previously selected ones,
thereby striving to reduce redundancy (Carbonell
and Goldstein, 1998).
More recently, the work of Svore et al. (2007)
is closely related to our approach as it has also ex-
ploited the CNN Story Highlights, although their
focus was on summarization and using ROUGE
as an evaluation and training measure. Their ap-
proach also heavily relies on additional data re-
sources, mainly indexed Wikipedia articles and
Microsoft Live query logs, which are not readily
available.
Linguistic features are today used mostly in
summarization systems, and include the standard
features sentence length, n-gram frequency, sen-
tence position, proper noun identification, similar-
ity to title, tf.idf, and so-called ‘bonus’/‘stigma’
words (Neto et al., 2002; Leite et al., 2007; Pol-
lock and Zamora, 1975; Goldstein et al., 1999).
On the other hand, for most of these systems, sim-
ple statistical features and tf.idf still turn out to be
the most important features.
Attempts to integrate discourse models have
also been made (Thione et al., 2004), hand in hand
with some of Marcu’s (1995) earlier work.

Regarding syntax, it seems to be used mainly
in sentence compression or trimming. The algo-
rithm used by Dorr et al. (2003) removes subor-
dinate clauses, to name one example. While our
approach does not use syntactical features as such,
it is worth noting these possible enhancements.

In this section we describe which features were
used and how the data was annotated to facilitate
feature extraction and estimation.

3.1 Training Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917592592593">
In order to determine the features used for pre-
dicting which sentences are the sources for story
highlights, we gathered statistics from 1,200 CNN
newswire articles. An additional 300 articles were
set aside to serve as a test set later on. The arti-
cles were taken from a wide range of topics: poli-
tics, business, sport, health, world affairs, weather,
entertainment and technology. Only articles with
story highlights were considered.
For each article we extracted a number of n-
gram statistics, where n E {1, 2, 3}.
n-gram score. We observed the frequency and
probability of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams ap-
pearing in both the article body and the highlights
of a given story. An important phrase (of length
n &lt; 3) in the article would likely be used again
in the highlights. These phrases were ranked and
scored according to the probability of their appear-
ing in a given text and its highlights.
Trigger phrases. These are phrases which cause
adjacent words to appear in the highlights. Over
the entire set, such phrases become significant. We
specified a limit of 2 words to the left and 4 words
to the right of a phrase. For example, the word ac-
cording caused other words in the same sentence
to appear in the highlights nearly 25% of the time.
Consider the highlight/sentence pair in Table 1:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.99618">
Table 1: Example highlight with source sentence.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977790625">
The word according receives a score of 3 since
{invading, Iraq, poll} are all in the highlight. It
should be noted that the trigram {invading Iraq
according} would receive an identical score, since
{not, worth, poll} are in the highlights as well.
Spawned phrases. Conversely, spawned
phrases occur frequently in the highlights and in
close proximity to trigger phrases. Continuing
the example in Table 1, {invading, Iraq, poll, not,
worth} are all considered to be spawned phrases.
Of course, simply using the identities of words
neglects the issue of lexical paraphrasing, e.g.,
involving synonyms, which we address to some
extent by using WordNet and other features de-
scribed in this Section. Table 2 gives an example
involving paraphrasing.

soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey.

Other approaches have tried to select linguistic
features which could be useful (Chuang and Yang,
2000), but these gather them under one heading
rather than treating them as separate features. The
identification of common verbs has been used both
as a positive (Turney, 2000) and as a negative
feature (Goldstein et al., 1999) in some systems,
whereas we score such terms according to a scale.
Turney also uses a ‘final adjective‘ measure. Use
of a thesaurus has also shown to improve results in
automatic summarization, even in multi-document
environments (McKeown et al., 1999) and other
languages such as Portuguese (Leite et al., 2007).

3.2 Feature Selection

<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
By manually inspecting the training data, the lin-
guistic features were selected. AURUM has two
types of features: sentence features, such as the
position of the sentence or the existence of a nega-
tion word, receive the same value for the entire
sentence. On the other hand, word features are
evaluated for each of the words in the sentence,
normalized over the number of words in the sen-
tence.
Our features resemble those suggested by previ-
ous works in keyphrase extraction and automatic
summarization, but map more closely to the jour-
nalistic characteristics of the corpus, as explained
in the following.

Temporal adverbs. Manually compiled list of
phrases, such as after less than, for two weeks and

Mention of the news agency’s name. Journal-
istic scoops and other exclusive nuggets of infor-
mation often recall the agency’s name, especially
when there is an element of self-advertisement
involved, as in “... The debates are being held
by CNN, WMUR and the New Hampshire Union
Leader.” It is interesting to note that an opposite
approach has previously been taken (Goldstein et
al., 1999), albeit involving a different corpus.

3.2.1 Sentence Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991036032258065">
These are the features which apply once for each
sentence.
Position of the sentence in the text. Intuitively,
facts of greater importance will be placed at the
beginning of the text, and this is supported by the
data, as can be seen in Figure 2. Only half of the
highlights stem from sentences in the first fifth of
the article. Nevertheless, selecting sentences from
only the first few lines is not a sure-fire approach.
Table 3 presents an article in which none of the
first four sentences were in the highlights. While
the baseline found no sentences, AURUM’s perfor-
mance was better.
The sentence positions score is defined as pi =
1 − (log i/log N), where i is the position of the
sentence in the article and N the total number of
sentences in the article.
Numbers or dates. This is especially evident
in news reports mentioning figures of casualties,
opinion poll results, or financial news.
Source attribution. Phrasings such as accord-
ing to a source or officials say.
Negations. Negations are often used for intro-
ducing new or contradictory information: “Kelly
is due in a Chicago courtroom Friday for yet an-
other status hearing, but there’s still no trial date
in sight.2” We selected a number of typical nega-
tion phrases to this end.
Causal adverbs. Manually compiled list of
phrases, including in order to, hoping for and be-
cause.

‘Bonus’ words. A list of phrases similar to sen-

the training data. This is akin to ‘bonus’/‘stigma’
words (Neto et al., 2002; Leite et al., 2007; Pol-
lock and Zamora, 1975; Goldstein et al., 1999).
Verb classes. After exploring the training data
we manually compiled two classes of verbs,
each containing 15-20 inflected and uninflected
lexemes, talkVerbs and actionVerbs.
talkVerbs include verbs such as {report, men-
tion, accuse} and actionVerbs refer to verbs
such as {provoke, spend, use}. Both lists also con-
tain the WordNet synonyms of each word in the
list (Fellbaum, 1998).

There are various optimization methods that allow
one to estimate the weights of features, includ-

methods (Malouf, 2002). We opted for general-
ized iterative scaling as it is commonly used for
other NLP tasks and off-the-shelf implementations
exist. Here we used YASMET.3

<bodyText confidence="0.9998534">
We used a development set of 240 news arti-
cles to train YASMET. As YASMET is a supervised
optimizer, we had to generate annotated data on
which it was to be trained. For each document in
the development set, we labeled each sentence as
to whether a story highlight was generated from it.
For instance, in the article presented in Figure 3,
sentences 5, 6, 7, 9 and 21 were marked as high-
light sources, whereas all other sentences in the
document were not.4
When annotating, all sentences that were di-
rectly relevant to the highlights were marked, with
preference given to those appearing earlier in the
story or containing more precise information. At
this point it is worth noting that while the over-
lap between different editors is unknown, the high-
lights were originally written by a number of dif-
ferent people, ensuring enough variation in the
data and helping to avoid over-fitting to a specific
editor.

4 Experiments and Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999739">
The CNN corpus was divided into a training set
and a development and test set. As we had
only 300 manually annotated news articles and we
wanted to maximize the number of documents us-
able for parameter estimation, we applied cross-
folding, which is commonly used for situations
with limited data. The dev/test set was randomly
partitioned into five folds. Four of the five folds
were used as development data (i.e. for parame-
ter estimation with YASMET), while the remaining
fold was used for testing. The procedure was re-
peated five times, each time with four folds used
for development and a separate one for testing.
Cross-folding is safe to use as long as there are
no dependencies between the folds, which is safe
to assume here.
Some statistics on our training and develop-
ment/test data can be found in Table 4.

Most summarization evaluation campaigns,
such as NIST’s Document Understanding Confer-
ences (DUC), impose a maximum length on sum-
maries (e.g., 75 characters for the headline gen-
eration task or 100 words for the summarization
task). When identifying sentences from which
story highlights are generated, the situation is
slightly different, as the number of story highlights
is not fixed. On the other hand, most stories have
between three and four highlights, and on aver-
age between four and five sentences per story from
which the highlights were generated. This varia-
tion led to us to carry out two sets of experiments:
In the first experiment (fixed), the number of
highlight sources is fixed and our system always
returns exactly four highlight sources. In the sec-
ond experiment (thresh), our system can return
between three and six highlight sources, depend-
ing on whether a sentence score passes a given
threshold. The threshold 0 was used to allocate
sentences si of article a to the highlight list HL
by first finding the highest-scoring sentence for
that article a(sh). The threshold score was thus
0 * a(sh) and sentences were judged accordingly.
The algorithm used is given in Figure 3.

<bodyText confidence="0.994742652173913">
All scores were compared to a baseline, which
simply returns the first n sentences of a news
article. n = 4 in the fixed experiment.
For the thresh experiment, the baseline al-
ways selected the same number of sentences as
AURUM-thresh, but from the beginning of the
article. Although this is a very simple baseline, it
is worth reiterating that it is also a very compet-
itive baseline, which most single-document sum-
marization systems fail to beat due to the nature of
news articles.
Since we are mainly interested in determining
to what extent our system is able to correctly iden-
tify the highlight sources, we chose precision and
recall as evaluation metrics. Precision is the per-
centage of all returned highlight sources which are
correct:
|R|
where R is the set of returned highlight sources
and T is the set of manually identified true sources
in the test set. Recall is defined as the percentage
of all true highlight sources that have been cor-
rectly identified by the system:

<equation confidence="0.960607">
Recall = |R n T|
|T|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.976056">
Precision and recall can be combined by using the
F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of the
two:

Table 5 shows the results for both experiments
(fixed and thresh) as an average over the
folds. To determine whether the observed differ-
ences between two approaches are statistically sig-
nificant and not just caused by chance, we applied
statistical significance testing. As we did not want
to make the assumption that the score differences
are normally distributed, we used the bootstrap
method, a powerful non-parametric inference test
(Efron, 1979). Improvements at a confidence level
of more than 95% are marked with “*”.
We can see that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline, and most of the
improvements—in particular the F-measure
scores—are statistically significant at the 0.95
level. As to be expected, AURUM-fixed
achieves higher precision gains, while
AURUM-thresh achieves higher recall gains. In
addition, for 83.3 percent of the documents, our
system’s F-measure score is higher than or equal
to that of the baseline.
Figure 4 shows how far down in the documents
our system was able to correctly identify highlight
sources. Although the distribution is still heavily
skewed towards extracting sentences from the be-
ginning of the document, it is so to a lesser extent
than just using positional information as a prior;
see Figure 2.
In a third set of experiments we measured the
n-gram overlap between the sentences we have
identified as highlight sources and the actual story
highlights in the ground truth. To this end we use

ROUGE (Lin, 2004), a recall-oriented evaluation
package for automatic summarization. ROUGE
operates essentially by comparing n-gram co-
occurrences between a candidate summary and a
number of reference summaries, and comparing
that number in turn to the total number of n-grams
in the reference summaries:

<bodyText confidence="0.999960069767442">
Where n is the length of the n-gram, with lengths
of 1 and 2 words most commonly used in current
evaluations. ROUGE has become the standard tool
for evaluating automatic summaries, though it is
not the optimal system for this experiment. This is
due to the fact that it is geared towards a different
task—as ours is not automatic summarization per
se—and that ROUGE works best judging between
a number of candidate and model summaries. The
ROUGE scores are shown in Table 6.
Similar to the precision and recall scores, our
approach consistently outperforms the baseline,
with all but one difference being statistically sig-
nificant. Furthermore, in 76.2 percent of the doc-
uments, our system’s ROUGE-1 score is higher
than or equal to that of the baseline, and like-
wise for 85.2 percent of ROUGE-2 scores. Our
ROUGE scores and their improvements over the
baseline are comparable to the results of Svore
et al. (2007), who optimized their approach to-
wards ROUGE and gained significant improve-
ments from using third-party data resources, both
of which our approach does not require.5
Table 7 shows the unique sentences extracted by
every system, which are the number of sentences
one system extracted correctly while the other did
not; this is thus an intuitive measure of how much
two systems differ. Essentially, a system could
simply pick the first two sentences of each arti-
cle and might thus achieve higher precision scores,
since it is less likely to return ‘wrong’ sentences.
However, if the scores are similar but there is a
difference in the number of unique sentences ex-
tracted, this means a system has gone beyond the
first 4 sentences and extracted others from deeper
down inside the text.
To get a better understanding of the impor-
tance of the individual features we examined the
weights as determined by YASMET. Table 8 con-
tains example output from the development sets,
with feature selection determined implicitly by
the weights the MaxEnt model assigns, where
non-discriminative features receive a low weight.

Clearly, sentence position is of highest impor-
tance, while trigram ‘trigger’ phrases were quite
important as well. Simple bigrams continued to
be a good indicator of data value, as is often
the case. Proper nouns proved to be a valuable
pointer to new information, but mention of the
news agency’s name had less of an impact than
originally thought. Other particularly significant
features included temporal adjectives, superlatives
and all n-gram measures.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985542857143">
A system for extracting essential facts from a news
article has been outlined here. Finding the data
nuggets deeper down is a cross between keyphrase
extraction and automatic summarization, a task
which requires more elaborate features and param-
eters.
Our approach emphasizes a wide variety of fea-
tures, including many linguistic features. These
features range from the standard (n-gram fre-
quency), through the essential (sentence position),
to the semantic (spawned phrases, verb classes and
types of adverbs).
Our experimental results show that a combina-
tion of statistical and linguistic features can lead
to competitive performance. Our approach not
only outperformed a notoriously difficult baseline
but also achieved similar performance to the ap-
proach of (Svore et al., 2007), without requiring
their third-party data resources.
On top of the statistically significant improve-
ments of our approach over the baseline, we see
value in the fact that it does not settle for sentences
from the beginning of the articles.
Most single-document automatic summariza-
tion systems use other features, ranging from
discourse structure to lexical chains. Consider-
ing Marcu’s conclusion (2003) that different ap-
proaches should be combined in order to create
a good summarization system (aided by machine
learning), there seems to be room yet to use ba-
sic linguistic cues. Seeing as how our linguis-
tic features—which are predominantly semantic—
aid in this task, it is quite possible that further in-
tegration will aid in both automatic summarization
and keyphrase extraction tasks.

Our approach uses syntactic, semantic, and general statistical features to identify the most important sentences in a document. The importance of the individual features is estimated using generalized iterative scaling methods trained on an annotated newswire corpus. The performance of our approach is evaluated against 300 unseen news articles and shows that use of these features results in statistically significant improvements over a provenly robust baseline, as measured using metrics such as precision, recall and ROUGE.</abstract>

The KEA keyphrase extraction system (Witten et al., 1999) mainly relies on purely statistical features such as term frequencies, using the tf.idf measure from Information Retrieval,1 as well as on a term’s position in the text. In addition to tf.idf scores, Hulth (2004) uses part-of-speech tags and NP chunks and complements this with machine learning; the latter has been used to good results in similar cases (Turney, 2000; Neto et al., 2002). The B&amp;C system (Barker and Cornacchia, 2000), also used linguistic methods to a very limited extent, identifying NP heads. INFORMATIONFINDER (Krulwich and Burkey, 1996) requires user feedback to train the system, whereby a user notes whether a given document is of interest to them and specifies their own keywords which are then learned by the system. Over the last few years, numerous singleas well as multi-document summarization approaches have been developed.

In this paper we will focus mainly on single-document summarization as it is more relevant to the issue we aim to address and traditionally proves harder to accomplish. A good example of a powerful approach is a method named Maximum Marginal Relevance which extracts a sentence for the summary only if it is different than previously selected ones, thereby striving to reduce redundancy (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). More recently, the work of Svore et al. (2007) is closely related to our approach as it has also exploited the CNN Story Highlights, although their focus was on summarization and using ROUGE as an evaluation and training measure. Their approach also heavily relies on additional data resources, mainly indexed Wikipedia articles and Microsoft Live query logs, which are not readily available.

To determine whether the observed differences between two approaches are statistically significant and not just caused by chance, we applied statistical significance testing. As we did not want to make the assumption that the score differences are normally distributed, we used the bootstrap method, a powerful non-parametric inference test (Efron, 1979). Improvements at a confidence level of more than 95% are marked with “*”. We can see that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline, and most of the improvements—in particular the F-measure scores—are statistically significant at the 0.95 level.

Other approaches have tried to select linguistic features which could be useful (Chuang and Yang, 2000), but these gather them under one heading rather than treating them as separate features. The identification of common verbs has been used both as a positive (Turney, 2000) and as a negative feature (Goldstein et al., 1999) in some systems, whereas we score such terms according to a scale. Turney also uses a ‘final adjective‘ measure.

Temporal adverbs. Manually compiled list of phrases, such as after less than, for two weeks and Thursday. Mention of the news agency’s name. Journalistic scoops and other exclusive nuggets of information often recall the agency’s name, especially when there is an element of self-advertisement involved, as in “... The debates are being held by CNN, WMUR and the New Hampshire Union Leader.” It is interesting to note that an opposite approach has previously been taken (Goldstein et al., 1999), albeit involving a different corpus. 3.2.1 Sentence Features These are the features which apply once for each sentence. Position of the sentence in the text. Intuitively, facts of greater importance will be placed at the beginning of the text, and this is supported by the data, as can be seen in Figure 2.

After exploring the training data we manually compiled two classes of verbs, each containing 15-20 inflected and uninflected lexemes, talkVerbs and actionVerbs. talkVerbs include verbs such as {report, mention, accuse} and actionVerbs refer to verbs such as {provoke, spend, use}.

Several methods have been proposed over the last two decades, among which keyword extraction and summarization are the most prominent ones. Keyword extraction aims to identify the most relevant words or phrases in a document, e.g., (Witten et al., 1999), while summarization aims to provide a short (commonly 100 words), coherent full-text summary of the document, e.g., (McKeown et al., 1999). Key fact extraction falls in between key word extraction and summarization. Here, the challenge is to identify the most relevant facts in a document, but not necessarily in a coherent full-text form as is done in summarization. Evidence of the usefulness of key fact extraction is CNN’s web site which since 2006 has most of its news articles preceded by a list of story highlights, see Figure 1. The advantage of the news highlights as opposed to full-text summaries is that they are much ‘easier on the eye’ and are better suited for quick skimming.

Automating highlight generation can help eliminate those delays. Journalistic training emphasizes that news articles should contain the most important information in the beginning, while less important information, such as background or additional details, appears further down in the article. This is also the main reason why most summarization systems applied to news articles do not outperform a simple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005). On the other hand, most of CNN’s story highlights are not taken from the beginning of the articles. In fact, more than 50% of the highlights stem from sentences that are not among the first 100 words of the articles. This makes identifying story highlights a much more challenging task than single-document summarization in the news domain.

Automating highlight generation can help eliminate those delays. Journalistic training emphasizes that news articles should contain the most important information in the beginning, while less important information, such as background or additional details, appears further down in the article. This is also the main reason why most summarization systems applied to news articles do not outperform a simple baseline that just uses the first 100 words of an article (Svore et al., 2007; Nenkova, 2005). On the other hand, most of CNN’s story highlights are not taken from the beginning of the articles. In fact, more than 50% of the highlights stem from sentences that are not among the first 100 words of the articles. This makes identifying story highlights a much more challenging task than single-document summarization in the news domain. In order to automate story highlight identification we automatically extract syntactic, semantic, Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the ACL, pages 415–423, Athens, Greece, 30 March – 3 April 2009. c�2009 Associati</context>

Over the last few years, numerous singleas well as multi-document summarization approaches have been developed. In this paper we will focus mainly on single-document summarization as it is more relevant to the issue we aim to address and traditionally proves harder to accomplish. A good example of a powerful approach is a method named Maximum Marginal Relevance which extracts a sentence for the summary only if it is different than previously selected ones, thereby striving to reduce redundancy (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). More recently, the work of Svore et al. (2007) is closely related to our approach as it has also exploited the CNN Story Highlights, although their focus was on summarization and using ROUGE as an evaluation and training measure. Their approach also heavily relies on additional data resources, mainly indexed Wikipedia articles and Microsoft Live query logs, which are not readily available.

The ROUGE scores are shown in Table 6. Similar to the precision and recall scores, our approach consistently outperforms the baseline, with all but one difference being statistically significant. Furthermore, in 76.2 percent of the documents, our system’s ROUGE-1 score is higher than or equal to that of the baseline, and likewise for 85.2 percent of ROUGE-2 scores. Our ROUGE scores and their improvements over the baseline are comparable to the results of Svore et al. (2007), who optimized their approach towards ROUGE and gained significant improvements from using third-party data resources, both of which our approach does not require.5 Table 7 shows the unique sentences extracted by every system, which are the number of sentences one system extracted correctly while the other did not; this is thus an intuitive measure of how much two systems differ. Essentially, a system could simply pick the first two sentences of each article and might thus achieve higher precision scores, since it is less likely to return ‘wrong’ sentences. However, if the scores are similar </context>

Our approach emphasizes a wide variety of features, including many linguistic features. These features range from the standard (n-gram frequency), through the essential (sentence position), to the semantic (spawned phrases, verb classes and types of adverbs). Our experimental results show that a combination of statistical and linguistic features can lead to competitive performance. Our approach not only outperformed a notoriously difficult baseline but also achieved similar performance to the approach of (Svore et al., 2007), without requiring their third-party data resources. On top of the statistically significant improvements of our approach over the baseline, we see value in the fact that it does not settle for sentences from the beginning of the articles. Most single-document automatic summarization systems use other features, ranging from discourse structure to lexical chains. Considering Marcu’s conclusion (2003) that different approaches should be combined in order to create a good summarization system (aided by machine learning), there seems to be room yet to use basic linguistic cues.

Other approaches have tried to select linguistic features which could be useful (Chuang and Yang, 2000), but these gather them under one heading rather than treating them as separate features. The identification of common verbs has been used both as a positive (Turney, 2000) and as a negative feature (Goldstein et al., 1999) in some systems, whereas we score such terms according to a scale. Turney also uses a ‘final adjective‘ measure. Use of a thesaurus has also shown to improve results in automatic summarization, even in multi-document environments (McKeown et al., 1999) and other languages such as Portuguese (Leite et al., 2007). 3.2 Feature Selection By manually inspecting the training data, the linguistic features were selected.

Several methods have been proposed over the last two decades, among which keyword extraction and summarization are the most prominent ones. Keyword extraction aims to identify the most relevant words or phrases in a document, e.g., (Witten et al., 1999), while summarization aims to provide a short (commonly 100 words), coherent full-text summary of the document, e.g., (McKeown et al., 1999). Key fact extraction falls in between key word extraction and summarization. Here, the challenge is to identify the most relevant facts in a document, but not necessarily in a coherent full-text form as is done in summarization. Evidence of the usefulness of key fact extraction is CNN’s web site which since 2006 has most of its news articles preceded by a list of story highlights, see Figure 1.
