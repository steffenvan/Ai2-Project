We study the task of automatically disam-
biguating word combinations such as jump
the gun which are ambiguous between a lit-
eral and MWE interpretation, focusing on the
utility of type-level features from an MWE
lexicon for the disambiguation task. To
this end we combine gold-standard idiomatic-
ity of tokens in the OpenMWE corpus with
MWE-type-level information drawn from the
recently-published JDMWE lexicon. We find
that constituent modifiability in an MWE-type
is more predictive of the idiomaticity of its
tokens than other constituent characteristics
such as semantic class or part of speech.

1 Introduction

A multiword expression (MWE) is a phrase or
sequence of words which exhibits idiosyncratic be-
haviour (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2009).
The nature of this idiosyncracy may be purely dis-
tributional — such as hot and cold being more com-
mon than cold and hot — but in this paper we study
MWEs with idiosyncratic semantics. Specifically
we are concerned with expressions such as jump the
gun which are ambiguous between a literal interpre-
tation of “to leap over a firearm”, and an idiomatic
interpretation of “to act prematurely”.
While MWEs are increasingly entering the main-
stream of NLP, the accurate identification of MWEs
remains elusive for current methods, particularly in
the absence of MWE type-specialised training data.
This paper builds on the work of Hashimoto et al.
(2006) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) in ex-
ploring whether type-level MWE properties sourced
from an idiom dictionary can boost the accuracy of
crosstype MWE-token classification. That is, we
attempt to determine whether token occurrences of
ambiguous expressions such as Kim jumped the gun
on this issue are idiomatic or literal, based on: (a)
annotated instances for MWEs other than jump the
gun (e.g. we may only have token-level annotations
for kick the bucket and throw in the towel), and (b)
dictionary-based information on the syntactic prop-
erties of the idiom in question.
We find that constituent modifiability judgments
extracted from the idiom dictionary are more predic-
tive of the idiomaticity of tokens than other features
of the idiom’s constituents such as part of speech
or lexeme. However, violations of the dictionary’s
modifiability rules have variable utility for machine
learning classification, being suggestive of the literal
class but not definitive. Finally, we present novel re-
sults illuminating the effectiveness of contextual se-
mantic vectors at MWE-token classification.

The OpenMWE corpus (Hashimoto and Kawahara,
2009) is a gold-standard corpus of over 100, 000
Japanese MWE-tokens covering 146 types. It is the
largest resource we are aware of which has hand-
annotated instances of MWEs which are ambiguous
between a literal and idiomatic interpretation, and
has been used by Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009)
and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) for supervised
classification of MWE-tokens using features cap-
turing lexico-syntactic variation and traditional se-
mantic features borrowed from word sense disam-
biguation (WSD) . Similar work in other languages
has been performed by Li and Sporleder (2010) and
Diab and Bhutada (2009). We build on this work in
exploring the use of MWE-type-level features drawn
from an idiom dictionary for MWE identification.

Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) developed a va-
riety of features capturing lexico-syntactic variation
but only one — a Boolean feature for “internal mod-
ification”, which fired only when a non-constituent
word appeared between constituent words in an
MWE-token — had an appreciable impact on classi-
fication. However, they found that this effect was far
overshadowed by semantic context features inspired
by WSD. That is, treating each MWE-type as a word
with two senses and performing sense disambigua-
tion was far more successful than any features based
on lexico-syntactic characteristics of idioms. Intu-
itively, we would expect that if we had access to a
rich inventory of expression-specific type-level fea-
tures encoding the ability of the expression to partic-
ipate in different syntactic alternations, we should be
better equipped to disambiguate token occurrences
of that expression. Indeed, the work of Fazly et al.
(2009) would appear to support this hypothesis, in
that the authors used unsupervised methods to learn
type-level preferences for a range of MWE types,
and demonstrated that these could be successfully
applied to a token-level disambiguation task.
Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) trained indi-
vidual classifiers for each MWE-type in their cor-
pus and tested them only on instances of the type
they were trained on. In contrast to this type-
specialised classification, Fothergill and Baldwin
(2011) trained classifiers on a subset of MWE-types
and tested on instances of the remaining held-out
MWE-types. The motivation for this crosstype
classification was to test the use of data from the
OpenMWE corpus for MWE-token classification of
MWE-types with no gold-standard data available
(which are by far the majority). Fothergill and Bald-
win (2011) introduced features for crosstype classi-
fication which captured features of the MWE-type,
reasoning that similar expressions would have sim-
ilar propensity for idiomaticity. We introduce new
MWE-type features expressing the modifiability of
constituents based on information extracted from an
MWE dictionary with wide coverage.
Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) expected that
WSD features — however successful at type spe-
cialised classification — would lose their advantage
in crosstype classification because of the lack of a
common semantics between MWE-types. However,
this turned out not to be the case, with by far the
most successful results arising again from use of
WSD features. This surprising result raises the pos-
sibility of distributional similarity between the con-
texts of idiomatic MWE-tokens of different MWE-
types, however the result was not explained or ex-
plored further. In this paper we offer new insights
into the distributional similarity hypothesis.
The recently-published JDMWE (Japanese Dic-
tionary of Multiword Expressions) encodes type-
level information on thousands of Japanese MWEs
(Shudo et al., 2011). A subset of the dictionary has
been released, and overlaps to some extent with the
MWE-types in the OpenMWE corpus. JDMWE en-
codes information about lexico-syntactic variations
allowed by each MWE-type it contains. For exam-
ple, the expression hana wo motaseru — literally
“to have [someone] hold flowers” but figuratively
“to let [someone] take the credit” — has the syntac-
tic form entry [N wo] *V30. The asterix indicates
modifiability, telling us that the head [V]erb mo-
taseru “cause to hold” allows modification by non-
constituent dependents – such as adverbs – but the
dependent [N]oun hana “flowers” does not.

We extracted the modifiability flags from the syntac-
tic field of entries in JDMWE and generated a feature
for each modifiable constituent, identified by its po-
sition in the type’s parse tree. The motivation for
this is to allow machine learning algorithms to cap-
ture any similarities in idiomaticity between MWE-
types with similar modifiability.
Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) also aimed to
exploit crosstype similarity with their type fea-
tures. They extracted lexical features (part-of-
speech, lemma and semantic category) of the type
headword and other constituents. We use these fea-
tures as point of contrast.

seven buckets. Features in related work have flagged
the presence of any internal modifier uncondition-
ally (Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2009; Fothergill and
Baldwin, 2011). We introduce a refined feature
which fires only when a MWE-token has an internal
modifier which violates the constituent modification
constraints encoded in JDMWE.
JDMWE modifiability constraints could also be
construed to proscribe external modifiers. Sentential
subjects and other external arguments of the head
verb are too common to be sensibly proscribed but
we did include a feature flagging proscribed exter-
nal modification of leaf constituents such as wa-
ter in kick the bucket of water. This feature effec-
tively refines the adnominal modification feature of
Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) which indiscrimi-
nately flags external modifications on a leaf noun.
We include in our analysis a contrast of these fea-
tures to token-based features in related work. The
closest related features are those focussed on the
MWE characteristic of lexico-syntactic fixedness
termed idiom features by Hashimoto and Kawahara
(2009) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011):

Additionally, we include WSD-inspired features

in the paragraph, local and syntactic contexts of the

for classification accuracy in both type-specialised

<bodyText confidence="0.999918782608696">
We worked with a subset of the OpenMWE cor-
pus comprising those types having: (a) an entry in
the released subset of the JDMWE, and (b) both lit-
eral and idiomatic classes represented by at least 50
MWE-tokens each in the corpus. This leaves only 27
MWE-types and 23,392 MWE-tokens and means
that our results are not directly comparable to those
of Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) and Fothergill
and Baldwin (2011). The release of the full JDMWE
should enable more comparable results.
We constructed a crosstype classification task
by ten-fold cross validation of the MWE-types in
the OpenMWE subset, with micro-averaged results.
Training sets were the union of all MWE-tokens of
MWE-types in a partition. The majority class was
the idiomatic sense and provided a baseline accu-
racy of 0.594. Support Vector Machine models with
linear kernels were trained on various feature com-
binations using the libSVM package.
Our JDMWE type-level features performed com-
paratively well at the crosstype task, with an accu-
racy of 0.647, at 5.3 percentage points above the
baseline. This is a marked improvement on the lex-
ical type-level features from related work, which
achieved an accuracy of 4.0 points above baseline.
As has been observed in related work, the accuracy
gained by using type-level features is much smaller
than the token-level WSD features. However, the
relative performance of the JDMWE type features to
the lexical type features is sustained in combination
with other feature types, as shown in Figure 1a.
Our JDMWE token-level features on the other
hand perform quite badly at crosstype classification.
When measured against the baseline or used to aug-
ment other token features, they degraded or only
marginally improved performance. The fact that us-
ing these features resulted in worse-than-baseline
performance suggests that the constituent modifia-
bility features extracted from JDMWE may not be
strict constraints as they are construed.
To better examine the quality of the JDMWE con-
stituent modifiability constraint features, we con-
structed a heuristic classifier. The classifier applies
the idiomatic class by default, but the literal class to
any MWE-token which violates the JDMWE con-
stituent modifiability constraints. This classifier’s

precision on the literal class was 0.624, meaning that
fully 0.376 of modifiability constraint violations in
the corpus occured for idiomatic tokens.
However, the classifier was correct in its literal
class labels more than half the time so it achieved a
better accuracy than the majority class classifer, at
0.612. As such, the heuristic classifier comfortably
outperformed the Support Vector Machine classifier
based on the same features. This shows that our poor
results with regards to the JDMWE constraint viola-
tion features are due mainly to failures of the ma-
chine learning model to take advantage of them.
As to the strength of the constraints encoded in
JDMWE, we found that 4.4% of all idiomatic tokens
in the corpus violated constituent modification con-
straints, and 10.8% of literal tokens. Thus the con-
straints seem sound but not as rigid as presented by
the JDMWE developers.
Figure 1a shows that even with our improvements
to type-level features, the finding of Fothergill and
Baldwin (2011) that WSD context features perform
best at crosstype classification still holds. We can-
not fully account for this, but one observation re-
garding the results of our type-specialised evaluation
may have bearing on the crosstype scenario.
For our type-specialised classification task we
performed cross-validation for each MWE-type in
isolation, aggregating final results. Some types had
a literal majority class, so the baseline accuracy was
0.741. Figure 1b shows that type-specialised classi-
fication performance is basically constant when re-
stricting analysis to only the idiomatic test instances.
The huge performance boost produced through the
use of WSD features occurs only on literal instances
(see Figure 1c). That is, our type-specialised clas-
sifiers are capturing distributional similarity of con-
text for the literal instances of a MWE-type but not
for the idiomatic instances. Since the contexts of id-
iomatic instances of the same MWE-type do not ex-
hibit a usable distributional similarity, it is unlikely
that crosstype similarities between idiomatic MWE-
token contexts can explain the efficacy of WSD fea-
tures for crosstype classification.

Using a MWE dictionary as input to a supervised
crosstype MWE-token classification task we have
shown that the constituents’ modifiability character-
istics tell more about idiomaticity than their lexical
characteristics. We found that the constituent modi-
fication constraints in JDMWE are not hard-and-fast
rules but do show up statistically in the OpenMWE
corpus. Finally, we found that distributional simi-
larity of the contexts of idiomatic MWE-tokens is
unlikely to be the source of the success of WSD fea-
tures on MWE-token classification accuracy.

That is, we attempt to determine whether token occurrences of ambiguous expressions such as Kim jumped the gun on this issue are idiomatic or literal, based on: (a) annotated instances for MWEs other than jump the gun (e.g. we may only have token-level annotations for kick the bucket and throw in the towel), and (b) dictionary-based information on the syntactic properties of the idiom in question.

It is the largest resource we are aware of which has handannotated instances of MWEs which are ambiguous between a literal and idiomatic interpretation, and has been used by Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) for supervised classification of MWE-tokens using features capturing lexico-syntactic variation and traditional semantic features borrowed from word sense disambiguation (WSD) .

Indeed, the work of Fazly et al.

Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) trained individual classifiers for each MWE-type in their corpus and tested them only on instances of the type they were trained on. In contrast to this typespecialised classification, Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) trained classifiers on a subset of MWE-types and tested on instances of the remaining held-out MWE-types. The motivation for this crosstype classification was to test the use of data from the OpenMWE corpus for MWE-token classification of MWE-types with no gold-standard data available (which are by far the majority).

The motivation for this is to allow machine learning algorithms to capture any similarities in idiomaticity between MWEtypes with similar modifiability. Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) also aimed to exploit crosstype similarity with their type features. They extracted lexical features (part-ofspeech, lemma and semantic category) of the type headword and other constituents. We use these features as point of contrast. 3.2 Token features An internal modifier is a dependent of a constituent which is not a constituent itself but divides an MWEtoken into two parts, such as the word seven in kick 101 seven buckets. Features in related work have flagged the presence of any internal modifier unconditionally (Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2009; Fothergill and Baldwin, 2011). We introduce a</context>

This feature effectively refines the adnominal modification feature of Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) which indiscriminately flags external modifications on a leaf noun. We include in our analysis a contrast of these features to token-based features in related work. The closest related features are those focussed on the MWE characteristic of lexico-syntactic fixedness termed idiom features by Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011): • the flag for internal modification; • the flag for adnominal modification; • lexical features such as part-of-speech, lemma and semantic category extracted from an internal or adnominal modifier; • inflections of the head constituent. Additionally, we include WSD-inspired features used by Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011). These are all lexical features extracted from context, including partof-speech, lemma and semantic category of words in the paragraph, local and syntactic contexts of the MWE-token.

The JDMWE features emitted for this token are the type feature modifiable(1) and the token feature proscribed premodifier(2). 4 Results We worked with a subset of the OpenMWE corpus comprising those types having: (a) an entry in the released subset of the JDMWE, and (b) both literal and idiomatic classes represented by at least 50 MWE-tokens each in the corpus. This leaves only 27 MWE-types and 23,392 MWE-tokens and means that our results are not directly comparable to those of Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) and Fothergill and Baldwin (2011). The release of the full JDMWE should enable more comparable results. We constructed a crosstype classification task by ten-fold cross validation of the MWE-types in the OpenMWE subset, with micro-averaged results. Training sets were the union of all MWE-tokens of MWE-types in a partition. The majority class was the idiomatic sense and provided a baseline accuracy of 0.594. Support Vector Machine models with linear kernels were trained on various feature combinations using the libSVM package. Our JDMWE type-level features performed comparatively well at the crosstype task, with an accuracy of</context>

This shows that our poor results with regards to the JDMWE constraint violation features are due mainly to failures of the machine learning model to take advantage of them. As to the strength of the constraints encoded in JDMWE, we found that 4.4% of all idiomatic tokens in the corpus violated constituent modification constraints, and 10.8% of literal tokens. Thus the constraints seem sound but not as rigid as presented by the JDMWE developers. Figure 1a shows that even with our improvements to type-level features, the finding of Fothergill and Baldwin (2011) that WSD context features perform best at crosstype classification still holds. We cannot fully account for this, but one observation regarding the results of our type-specialised evaluation may have bearing on the crosstype scenario. For our type-specialised classification task we performed cross-validation for each MWE-type in isolation, aggregating final results. Some types had a literal majority class, so the baseline accuracy was 0.741. Figure 1b shows that type-specialised classification performance is basically constant when restricting analysis to only the idiomatic test instances. Th</context>

To this end we combine gold-standard idiomaticity of tokens in the OpenMWE corpus with MWE-type-level information drawn from the recently-published JDMWE lexicon. We find that constituent modifiability in an MWE-type is more predictive of the idiomaticity of its tokens than other constituent characteristics such as semantic class or part of speech. 1 Introduction A multiword expression (MWE) is a phrase or sequence of words which exhibits idiosyncratic behaviour (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2009). The nature of this idiosyncracy may be purely distributional — such as hot and cold being more common than cold and hot — but in this paper we study MWEs with idiosyncratic semantics.

However, this turned out not to be the case, with by far the most successful results arising again from use of WSD features. This surprising result raises the possibility of distributional similarity between the contexts of idiomatic MWE-tokens of different MWEtypes, however the result was not explained or explored further. In this paper we offer new insights into the distributional similarity hypothesis. The recently-published JDMWE (Japanese Dictionary of Multiword Expressions) encodes typelevel information on thousands of Japanese MWEs (Shudo et al., 2011). A subset of the dictionary has been released, and overlaps to some extent with the MWE-types in the OpenMWE corpus. JDMWE encodes information about lexico-syntactic variations allowed by each MWE-type it contains. For example, the expression hana wo motaseru — literally “to have [someone] hold flowers” but figuratively “to let [someone] take the credit” — has the syntactic form entry [N wo] *V30. The asterix indicates modifiability, telling us that the head [V]erb motaseru “cause to hold” allows modification by nonconstituent dependents – such as adverbs – but the dependent [N]oun hana “flow</context>
