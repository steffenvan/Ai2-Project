INTRODUCTION

This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the 2001 Workshop on Data Driven
Machine Translation, which is part ofthe 39th Annual Meeting ofthe Association for Computational
Linguistics held on July 7, 2001 in Toulouse, France.
With the increased availability of online corpora, data-dri ven approaches have become central
to the NL community. A variety of data-dri ven approaches have been used to help build Machine
Translation systems –example-based, statistical MT, and other machine learning approaches –
and there are all sorts of possibilities for hybrid systems. We have endeavored to bring together
proponents of as many techniques as possible to engage in a discussion of which combinations will
yield maximal success in translation. We have chosen to center the workshop on Data Driven MT,
by which we mean all approaches which develop algorithms and programs to exploit data in the
development of MT, primarily the use of large bilingual corpora created by human translators, and
serving as a source of training data for MT systems.
To further this theme, the conference program also includes an invited talk on the subject. We
would like to thank our invited speaker, Hermann Ney, for his participation.
Organizing a workshop like this is a bit of an effort –especially given what seemed to be
very tight deadlines. Luckily, we had exceptionally cooperative program committee members and
reviewers. From an initial slate of 26 submissions, they selected the papers in this proceedings in
a blind refereeing process. We deeply and sincerely thank all who reviewed: we would have run
aground without their efforts.
Additionally , we would like to thank Deborah Coughlin for joining us in organizing the workshop.
She was able to implement the reviewing process, organize the reception of the papers and master
all the nitty-gritty without which the workshop and the proceedings could not happen.
We most gratefully acknowledge the support of our sponsor, Microsoft Research, for generous
support of this activity.
