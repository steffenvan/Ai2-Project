This paper raises concerns that natural language front
ends for computer systems can limit a researcher&apos;s
scope of thinking, yield inappropriately complex systems,
• and exaggerate public fear of computers. Alternative
modes of computer use are suggested and the role of
psychologically oriented controlled experimentation is
emphasized. Research methods and recent experimental
results are briefly reviewed.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900986842105">
The capacity of sophisticated modern computers to
manipulate and display symbols offers remarkable oppor-
tunities for natural language communication among people.
Text editing systems are used to generate business or
personal letters, scientific research papers, newspaper
articles, or other textual data. Newer word processing,
electronic mail, and computer teleconferencing systems
are used to format, distribute, and share textual data.
Traditional record keeping systems for payroll, credit
verification, inventory, medical services, insurance,
or student grades contain natural language/textual data.
In these cases the computer is used as a communication
medium between humans, which may involve intermediate
stages where the computer is used as a tool for data
manipulation. Humans enter the data in natural lan-
guage form or with codes which represent pieces of text
(part number instead of a description, course number
instead of a title, etc.). The computer is used to
store the data in an internal form incomprehensible to
most humans, to make updates or transformations, and to
output it in a form which humans can read easily.
These systems should act in a comprehensible &amp;quot;tool-like&amp;quot;
manner in which system responses satisfy user expec-
tations.
Several researchers have commented on the impor-
tance of letting the user be in control [1], avoiding
acausality [2], promoting the personal worth of the
individual [3], and providing predictable behavior [4].
Practitioners have understood this principle as well:
Jerome Ginsburg of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
prepared an in-house set of guidelines which contained
this powerful claim:
&apos;Nothing can contribute more to satisfactory system per-
formance than the conviction on the part of the terminal
operators that they are in control of the system and
not the system in control of them. Equally, nothing
can be more damaging to satisfactory system operation,
regardless of how well all other aspects of the imple-
mentation have been handled, than the operator&apos;s con-
viction that the terminal and thus the system are in
control, have &apos;a mind of their own,&apos; or are tugging
against rather than observing the operator&apos;s wishes.&amp;quot;
I believe that control over system function and pre-
dictable behavior promote the personal worth of the
user, provide satisfaction, encourage competence, and
stimulate confidence. Many successful systems adhere
to these principles and offer terminal operators a
useful tool or an effective communication media.
An idea which has attracted researchers is to have the
computer take coded information (medical lab test
values or check marks on medical history forms) and
generate a natural language report which is easy to
read, and which contains interpretations or suggestions
for treatment. When the report is merely a simple
textual replacement of the coded data, the system may
be accepted by users, although the compact form of the
coded data may still be preferable for frequent users.
When the suggestions for treatment replace a human
decision, the hazy boundary between computer as tool
and computer as physician is crossed.
Other researchers are more direct in their attempt to
create systems which simulate human behavior. These
researchers may construct natural language front ends
to their systems allowing terminal operators to use
their own language for operating the computer. These
researchers argue that most terminal operators prefer
natural language because they are already familiar with
it, and that it gives the terminal operator the great-
est power and flexibility. After all, they argue,
computers should be easy to use with no learning and
computers should be designed to participate in dialogs
using natural language. These sophisticated systems
may use the natural language front ends for question-
answering from databases, medical diagnosis, computer-
assisted instruction, psychotherapy, complex decision
making, or automatic programming.

2. DANGERS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9960724">
When computer systems leave users with the impression
that the computer is thinking, making a decision, repre-
senting knowledge, maintaining beliefs, or understanding
information I begin to worry about the future of com-
puter science. I believe that it is counterproductive
to work on systems which present the illusion that they
are reproducing human capacities. Such an approach can
limit the researcher&apos;s scope of thinking, may yield an
inappropriately complex system, and potentially
exaggerates the already present fear of computers in
the general population.
2.1 NATURAL LANGUAGE LIMITS THE RESEARCHER&apos;S SCOPE
In constructing computer systems which mimic rather than
serve people, the developer may miss opportunities for
applying the unique and powerful features of a computer:
extreme speed, capacity to repeat tedious operations
accurately, virtually unlimited storage for data, and
distinctive input/output devices. Although the slaw
rate of human speech makes menu selection impractical,
high speed computer displays make menu selection an
appealing alternative. Joysticks, lightpens or the
&amp;quot;mouse&amp;quot; are extremely rapid and accurate ways of selec-
ting and moving graphic symbols or text an a display
screen. Taking advantage of these and other Octputer-
specific techniques will enable designers to create
powerful tools without natural language commands.
Building computer systems which behave like people do,
is like building a plane to fly by flapping its wings.
Once we get past the primitive imitation stage and
understand the scientific basis of this new technology
(more on how to do this later), the human imitation
strategies will be merely museum pieces for the 21st
century, joining the clockwork human imitations of the
18th century. Sooner or Later we will have to accept
the idea that computers are merely tools with no more
intelligence than a wooden pencil, If researchers can
free themselves of the human imitation game and begin
to think about using computers for problem solving in
novel ways, I believe that there will be an outpouring
of dramatic innovation.

2.2 NATURAL LANGUAGE YIELDS INAPPROPRIATELY COMPLEX
SYSTEMS
Constructing computer systems which present the illusion
of human capacities may yield inappropriately complex
systems. Natural language interaction with the tedious
clarification dialog seems archaic and ponderous when
compared with rapid, concise, &apos;and precise database
manipulation facilities such as Query-by-example or
commercial word processing systems. It&apos;s hard to under-
stand why natural language systems seem appealing when
contrasted with modern interactive mechanisms like high
speed menu selection, light pen movement of icons, or
special purpose interfaces which allow the user to
directly manipulate their reality. Natural language
systems must be complex enough to cope with user actions
stemming from a poor definition of system capabilities.
Some users may have unrealistic expectations of what the
computers can or should do. Rather than asking precise
questions from a database system, a user may be tempted
to ask how to improve profits, whether a defendant is
guilty, or whether a military action should be taken.
These questions involve complex ideas, value judgments,
and human responsibility for which computers cannot and
should not be relied upon in decision making.
Secondly, users may waste time and effort in querying
the database about data which is not contained in the
system. Codd [5] experienced this problem in his
RENDEZVOUS system and labeled it &amp;quot;semantic overshoot.&amp;quot;
In command systems the user may spend, excessive time in
trying to determine if the system supports the oper-
ations they have in mind.
Thirdly, the ambiguity of natural language does not
facilitate the formation of questions or commands. A
precise and concise notation may actually help the user
in thinking of relevant questions or effective commands.
A small number of well defined operators may be more
useful than ill-formed natural language statements,
especially to novices. The ambiguity of natural lang-
uage may also interfere with careful thinking about the
data stored in the machine. An understanding of
onto/into mappings, one-to-one/one-to-many/many-to-many
relationships, set theory, boolean algebra, or predicate
calculus and the proper notation may be of great assis-
tance in formulating queries. Mathematicians (and
musicians, chemists, knitters, etc.) have long relied on
precise concise notations because they help in problem
solving and human-to-human communication. Indeed, the
syntax of precise concise query or command language may
provide the cues for the semantics of intended opera-
tions. This dependence on syntax is strongest for
naive users who can anchor novel semantic concepts to
the syntax presented.
2.3 NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATES MISTRUST, ANGER, FEAR
AND ANXIETY
Using computer systems which attempt to behave like
humans may be cute the first time they are tried, but
the smile is short-lived. The friendly greeting at the
start of some computer-assisted instruction systems,
computer games, or automated bank tellers, quickly
becomes an annoyance and, I believe, eventually leads
to mistrust and anger. The user of an automated bank
teller machine which starts with &amp;quot;Hello, how can I help
you?&amp;quot; recognizes the deception and soon begins to
wonder how else the bank is trying to deceive them.
Customers want simple tools whose range of functions
they understand. A more serious problem arises with
systems which carry on a complete dialog in natural
language and generate the image of a robot. Movie and
television versions of such computers produce anxiety,
alienation, and fear of computers taking over.
In the long run the public attitude towards computers
will govern the future of acceptable ..research, develop-
ment, and applications. Destruction of computer systems
in the United States during the turbulent 1960&apos;s, and
in France just recently (Newsweek April 28, 1980 — An
underground group, the Committee for the Liquidation or
Deterrence of Computers claimed responsibility for bomb-
ing Transportation Ministry computers and declared: &apos;We
are computer workers and therefore well placed to know
the present and future dangers of computer systems.
They are used to classify, control and to repress.&amp;quot;)
reveal the anger and fear that many people associate
with computers. The movie producers take their ideas
from research projects and the public reacts to common
experiences with computers. Distortions or exagger-
ations may be made, but there is a legitimate basis to
the public&apos;s anxiety.
One more note of concern before making some positive and
constructive suggestions. It has often disturbed me
that researchers in natural language usually build sys-
tems for someone else to use. If the idea is so good,
why don&apos;t researchers build natural language systems
for their own use. Why not entrust their taxes, home
management, calendar/schedule, medical care, etc. to an
expert system? Why not encode their knowledge about
their own disipline in a knowledge representation lang-
uage? If such systems are truly effective then the
developers should be rushing to apply them to their own
needs and further their professional career, financial
status, or personal needs.

3. HUMAN FACTORS EXPERIMENTATION FOR DEVELOPING INTER-
ACTIVE SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99768187804878">
My work with psychologically oriented experiments over
the past seven years has made a strong believer in the
utility of empirical testing [6]. I believe that we can
get past the my-language-is-better-than-your-language or
my-system-is-more-natural-and-easier-to-use stage of
computer science to a more rigorous and disciplined
approach. Subjective, introspective judgments based on
experience will always be necessary sources for new
ideas, but controlled experiments can be extremely valu-
able in demonstrating the effectiveness of novel inter-
active mechanisms, programming language control struc-
tures,or new text editing features. Experimental tes-
ting requires careful statement of a hypothesis, choice
of independent and dependent variables, selection and
assignment of subjects, administration to minimize bias,
statistical analysis, and assesment of the results.
This approach can reveal mistaken assumptions, demon-
strate generality, show the relative strengthof
effects, and provide evilence for a theory of human
behavior which may suggest new research.
A natural strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of
natural language facilities would be to define a task,
such as retrieval of ship convoy information or solu-
tion of a computational problem, then provide subjects
with either a natural language facility or an alterna-
tive mode such as a query language, simple programming
language, set of commands, menu selection, etc. Train-
ing provided with the natural language system or the
alternative would be a critical issue, itself the sub-
ject of study. Subjects would perform the task and be
evaluated on. the basis of accuracy or speed. In my own
experience, I prefer to provide a fixed time interval
and measure performance. Since inter-subject vari-
ability in task performance tends to be very large,
within subjects (also called repeated measures) designs
are effective. Su&apos;.1ects perform the task with each
mode and the statis Ace&apos; tests compare scores in one
mode against the other. To account for learning effects,
the expectation that the second time the task is per-
formed the subject does better, half the subjects begin
with natural language, while half the subjects begin

<bodyText confidence="0.998805513888889">
with the alternative mode. This experimental design
strategy is &amp;quot;(mown as counterbalanced orderings.
If working systems are available, then an on-line
experiment provides the most realistic environment, but
problems with operating systems, text editors, sign-on
procedures, system crashes, and other failures can bias
the results. Experimenters may also be concerned about
the slowness of some natural language systems on cur-
rently available computers as a biasing factor in such
experiments. An alternative would be on-line experi-
ments where a human plays the role of a natural language
system. This appears to be viable alternative [7] if
proper precautions are taken. Paper and pencil studies
are a suprisingly useful approach and are v4luable since
administration is easy. Much can be learned about human
thought processes and problem solving methods by con-
trasting natural language and proposed alternatives in
paper and pensil studies. Subjects may be asked to write
queries to a database of present a sequence of commands
using natural language or some alternative mode [9].
There is a growing body of experiments that is helping to
clarify issues and reveal problems about human perform-
ance with natural language usage on computers. Codd [5]
and Woods [8] describe informal studies in user perform-
ance with their natural language systems. Small and
Weldon [7] conducted the first rigorous comparison of
natural language with a database query language. Twenty
subjects worked with a subset of SEQUEL and an on-line
simulated natural language system to composed queries.
Shneiderman [9] describes a similar paper and pencil
experiment comparing performance with natural language
and a subset of SEQUEL. The results of both of these
experiments suggest that precise concise database query
language do aid the user in rapid formulation of more
effective queries.
Damerau [10] reports an a field study in which a function-
ing natural language system, TQA, was installed in a
city planning office. His system succeeded on 513 out of
788 queries during a one year period. Hershman, Kelly
and Miller [1].] describe a carefully controlled experi-
ment in which ten naval officers used the LADDER natural
language system after a ninety minute training period.
In a simulated rescue attempt the system properly res-
ponded to 258 out of 336 queries.
Critics and supporters of natural language usage can all
find heartening and disheartening evidence from these
experimental reports. The contribution of these studies
is in clarification of the research issues, development
of the experimental methodology, and production of guide-
lines for developers of interactive systems. I believe
that developers of natural language systems should avoid
over-emphasizing their tool and more carefully analyze
the problem to be solved as well as human capacities.
If the goal is to provide an appealing interface for
airline reservations, bank transactions, database
retrieval, or mathematical problem solving, then the
first step should be a detailed review of the possible
data structures, control structures, problem decomposi-
tions, cognitive models that the user might apply, repre-
sentation strategies, and importance of background know-
ledge. At the same time there should be a careful
analysis of how the computer system can provide assis-
tance by representing and displaying data in a useful
format, providing guidance in choosing alternative
strategies, offering effective messages at each stage
(feedback on failures and successes), recording the
history and current status of the problem solving
process, and giving the user comprehensible and powerful
commands.
Experimental research will be helpful in guiding devel-
opers of interactive systems and in evaluating the impor-
tance of the user&apos;s familiarity with:

Experiments are useful because of their precision,
narrow focus, and replicability. Each experiment may
be a minor contribution, but, with all its weaknesses,
it is more reliable than the anecdotal reports from
biased sources. Each experimental result, like a small
tile in a mosaic which has a clear shape and color,
adds to our image of human performance in the use of
computer systems.
