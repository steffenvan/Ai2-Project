We present_ an implemented concept-to-speech
(CTS) systeni that offers original proposals for
certain couplings- of dialogue computation with
prosodic computation. Specifically, the semantic in-
terpretation, task modeling and dialogue strategy
modules in a working spoken dialogue system are
used to generate prosodic features to better convey
the meaning of system replies. The new CTS system
embodies and extends theoretical work on intona-
tional meaning in a more general, robust and rigor-
ous way than earlier approaches, by reflecting com-
positional aspects of both dialogue and intonation

I. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798666666666">
Conversational systems that use speech as the input
and output modality are often realized by architec-
tures that decouple speech processing components
from language processing components. In this pa-
per, we show how speech generation can be more
closely coupled with the dialogue manager of a work-
ing mixed-initiative spoken dialogue system. In par-
ticular, we use representations from the semantic in-
terpretation, task model and dialogue strategy mod-
ules to better communicate the meaning of system
replies through prosodically appropriate synthetic
speech.
While dialogue prosody has been a topic of much
study, our implemented concept-to-speech (CTS)
system offers original proposals for specific couplings
of dialogue computation with prosodic computation.
Further, it embodies and extends theoretical work
on intonational meaning in a more general, robust
and rigorous way than earlier CTS systems, in an
architecture that reflects compositional aspects of
dialogue and intonation interpretation.

2 Theoretical Foundations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862230769231">
In this work, we implement and extend the com-
positional theory of intonational meaning proposed
by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1986; 1990),
who sought to identify correspondences between the
Grosz and SkIner (1986) computational model of dis-
course interpretation and Pierrehumbert &apos;s prosodic
grammar for American English (1980).
In the present work, certain aspects of the orig-
inal theories are modified and adapted to the ar-
chitecture of the dialogue system in which the CTS
component is embedded. Below, we present the im-
portant fundamental definitions and principles of in-
tonation underlying our CTS system.

2.1 Intonational System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970946">
In our CTS system, the prosodic elements that are
computed are based on the intonational system of
Pierrehumbert (1980), who defined a formal lan-
guage for describing American English intonation
using the following regular grammar:

Major phrases, or intonational phrases, are made
up of one or more minor phrases, or intermediate
phrases. Melodic movements in intermediate and
intonational phrases are in turn expressed by three
kinds of tonal elements. These include six pitch ac-
cents: a low pitch excursion (L*), a high pitch excur-
sion (I1*), or a combination of both low and high ex-
cursions (1,*+H, L+H*, 11*-FL, II-FL*); two phrase
accents: a high (H-) or low (L-) tonal target that
guides the interpolation of the melodic contour from
final pitch accent to intermediate phrase ending; and
two boundary tones: a high (11%) or low (L%) tonal
target that guides interpolation from phrase accent
to intonational phrase ending.

2.2 Intonational Meaning

<bodyText confidence="0.9996306">
Theoretical work on intonational meaning has at-
tempted to relate the grammatical elements of Pier-
rehumbert&apos;s system — pitch accent, phrase accent
and boundary tone, to interpretive processes at dif-
ferent levels of discourse and dialogue structure.
Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) conjectured
that the absence or presence of accentuation conveys
discourse focus status, while the tonal properties of
the accent itself (i.e. pitch accent type) cony. ey se-

In later work, pitch accent type was said to
express whether the accented information was in-
tended by the speaker to be &amp;quot;predicated&amp;quot; or not by
the hearer (Pierrehumbert and llirschberg, 1990).
Non-predicated-information was said to bear low-
star accentuation Il+L*), while predi-
cated information would be marked by high-star ac-
cents (II*, L+11*, II*-FL). The theory further stated
that 1..*4-11 conveys uncertainty or lack of speaker
commitment to the expressed propositional content,
while L+H* marks correction or contrast. The com-
plex accent, 11*-1-L, was said to convey that an infer-
ence path was required to support the predication;
usage of 11+1,* similarly was said to imply an in-
ference path, but did not suggest a predication of a
mutual belief. Finally, phrase accents and bound-
ary tones were said to reflect aspects of discourse
structure.

Our task is to improve the communicative compe-
tence of a spoken dialogue agent, by making re-
course to our knowledge of intonational meaning, di-
alogue processing and relations between the two. Of
course, a worthwhile CTS system must also outper-
form out-of-the-box text-to-speech (TTS) systems
that may determine prosodic mark-up in linguisti-
cally sophisticated ways. As in (Nakatani, 1998), we
take the prosodic output of an advanced research
system that implements the Pierrehumbert theory
of intonation, namely the Bell Labs TTS system,
as our baseline experimental system to be enhanced
by CTS algorithms. We embed the CTS system in
MIMIC, a working spoken dialogue system repre-
senting state-of-the-art dialogue management prac-
tices, to develop CTS algorithms that can be eventu-
ally realistically evaluated using task-based perfor-
mance metrics.

The dialogue system whose baseline speech gen-

(Chu-Carroll, 2000). MIMIC. provides movie list-
Mg information involving knowledge about towns,
theaters, movies and showtimes, as demonstrated
in Figure 1. MIMIC currently utilizes template-
driven text generation, and passes on text strings
to a stand-alone TTS system. In the version of
MIMIC enhanced with concept-to-speech capabili-
ties, MIMIC-CTS, contextual knowledge is used to
modify the prosodic features of the slot and filler
material in the templates; we are currently integrat-

3.2 TTS: The Bell Labs System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999807">
For default prosodic processing and speech synthe-
sis realization, we use a research version of the
Bell Labs TTS System, circa 1992 (Sproat, 1997),
that generates intonational contours based on Pier-
rehumbert&apos;s intonation theory (1980), as described
hi (Pierrehumbert, 1981). Of relevance is the fact
that various pitch accent types, phrase accent and
boundary tones in Pierrehumbert&apos;s theory are di-
rectly implemented in this system, so that by gener-
ating a Pierrehumbert-style prosodic transcription,
the work of the CTS system is done. More pre-
cisely, MIMIC-CTS computes prosodic annotations
that override the default prosodic processing that is
performed by the Bell Labs TTS system.
To our knowledge, the intonation component of
the Bell Labs TTS system utilizes more linguistic
knowledge to compute prosodic annotations than
any other unrestricted TTS system, so it is reason-
able to assume that improvements upon it are mean-
ingful in practice as well as in theory.

makes use of three distinct levels of dialogue rep-
resentations to convey meaning through intonation.

how to prosodically highlight selected information,
based on the pragmatic properties of the system
reply. MIMIC&apos;s dialogue strategy selection process
informs various choices in prosodic contour and ac-
centing that convey logico-semantic aspects of mean-
ing, such as contradiction.

4.1 Highlighting Information using
Semantic Representations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855875">
MIMIC employs a statistically-driven semantic in-
terpretation engine to &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; values for key at-
tributes that make up a valid MIMIC query in a
robust fashion.&apos; To simplify matters, for each ut-
terance, MIMIC computes an attribute-value ma-
trix (AVM).- representation, identifying important
pieces of information for accomplishing a given set
of tasks. The AVM created from the following ut-
terance, &amp;quot;When is October Sky playing at Hoboken
Cinema in Hoboken?&amp;quot;, for example, is given in Fig-
ure 2.
Even such minimal use of dialogue information
can make a difference. For example, changing the
default accent for the following utterance highlights
the kind of information that the system is seeking,
instead of highlighting the semantically vacuous

<bodyText confidence="0.985743">
MIMIC performs a set of information-giving tasks,
i.e. what, where, when, location, that are concisely
defined by a task model. MIMIC processes the
AVM for each utterance and then evaluates whether
it should perform a database query based on the
task specifications given in Figure 3. The task
model defines which attribute values must be filled
in (Y), must not 116 filled in (N), or may optionally
be filled in (--), to &amp;quot;license&amp;quot; a database query action.
If no task is &amp;quot;specified&amp;quot; by the current AVM state,

Attribute names and attribute values are critical
to the task at hand. In MIMIC-CTS, attribute
names and values that occur in templates are typed,
so that MIMIC-CTS can highlight these items in
the following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996970666666667">

2. Attribute values are synthesized at a slower
speaking rate.

aries.

<bodyText confidence="0.943662966666667">
MIMIC employs various strategies to progress
toward a complete and valid task specification.
For example, in response to the following user
utterance, MIMIC initiates an information-seeking
subdialogue to instantiate the theater attribute
value to accomplish a when task:
User: when is october sky playing
in hoboken
MIMIC-CTS: what THEATER would you like
To better convey the structure of the task model,
which is learned by the user through interaction
with the system, we define four information statuses
based on properties of the task model, which align
on a scale of given and new in the following order:
4. Attribute names are always accented. OLD INFERRABLE KEY HEARER-NEW
These modifications are entirely rule-based, given a [given] [new]
list of attribute names and typed attribute values.
Specifically, MIMIC uses an n-climensional call router
front-end (Chu-Carroll, 2000), which is a generalization of
the vector-based call-routing paradigm of semantic interpre-
tation (Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999); that is, instead of
detecting one concept per utterance, MIMIC&apos;s semantic in-
terpretation engine detects multiple (n) concepts or classes
conveyed by a single utterance, by using n call routers in
parallel.
KEY information is that which is necessary to
formulate a valid database query, and is exchanged
and (implicitly or explicitly) confirmed between
the system and user. INFERRABLE information is
not explicitly exchanged between the system and

engine that seeks to instantiate as many attribute
values as possible. For instance, a theater name
may be inferred given a town name, if there is only
one theater in the given town. OLD information
is inherited from the discourse history, based on
updating rules relying on confidence scores for
attribute values. HEARER-NEW information (c.f.
(Prince, 1988)) is that which is requested by the
user, and constitutes the only new information on
the scale. But note that KEY information, while
given, is still clearly in discourse focus, along with
HEARER-NEW information.

The next step is to map the information statuses,
ordered from given to new, to a scale of pitch
accent, or accent melodies, ordered from given to

Table 1 summarizes this original mapping of infor-
mation statuses to pitch accent melodies, and Fig-
ure 4 illustrates the use of this mapping in an ex-
ample. It obeys the general principle of Pierrehum-
bert and Hirschberg&apos;s work, that low tonality sig-
nifies discourse givenness and high tonality signifies
discourse newness, but extends this principle beyond
its vague definition in terms of predication of mutual
beliefs. Instead, the principle is operationalized here
in a practically motivated manner that is consistent
with and perhaps illuminating of the theory.

4.3 Assigning &amp;quot;Dialogue Prosody&amp;quot; using
Dialogue Strategies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957781333333333">
As in earlier CTS systems, special logico-sernantic
relations, such as contrast or correction, are effec-
tively conveyed in MIMIC-CTS by prosodic cues. In
MIMIC-CTS, however, these situations are not stip-
ulated in an ad hoc manner, but can be determined
to a large degree by MIMIC&apos;s dialogue strategy se-
lection process that identifies appropriate dialogue
acts to realize a dialogue goal.&apos;
For example, the dialogue act ANSWER may be
selected to achieve the dialogue goal of providing an
answer to a successful user query, while the dialogue
act NOTIFYFAILURE may be performed to achieve
the dialogue goal of providing an answer in situations
where no movie listing in the database matches the
user query. The template associated with the di-
alogue act, NOTIFYFAILURE, when compared with
that for ANSWER, contains an additional negative
auxiliary associated with the key attribute responsi-
ble for the query failure, in an utterance conveying a
contradiction in beliefs between the user and system
(namely, the presupposition on the part of the user
that the query can be satisfied).
Theoretical work on intonational interpretation
leads us to prosodically mark the negative auxil-
iary, as well as the associated focus position (Rooth,
1985). We choose to mark the negative auxiliary not
with the L+H* pitch accent to convey correction,
while marking the material in the associated focus
position with the L*+H pitch accent to convey (the

Although a number of earlier CTS systems have
captured linguistic phenomena that we address in
our work, the computation of prosody from dialogue
representations is often not as rigorous, detailed or
complete as in MIMIC-CTS. Further, while several
systems use given/new information status to decide
whether to accent or deaccent a lexical item, no sys-
tem has directly implemented general rules for pitch
accent type assignment. Together, MIMIC-CTS&apos;s
computation of accentuation, pitch accent type and
dialogue prosody constitutes the most general and
complete implementation of a compositional theory
of intonational meaning in a CTS system to date.
Nevertheless, elements of a handful of previ-
ous CTS systems support the approaches taken
in MIMIC-CTS toward conveying semantic, task
and dialogue level meaning. For example, the Di-
rection Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg,
1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a
discourse structure for generated directions. The
discourse structure determined accentuation, with
deaccenting of discourse-old entities realized (by lex-
ically identical morphs) in the current or previous
discourse segment. Other material was assigned ac-
centuation based on lexical category information,
with the exception that certain contrastive cases of
accenting, such as left versus right, were stipulated
for the domain.
Accent assignment in the SUNDIAL travel infor-
mation system (House and Youd, 1990) also relied
on discourse and task models. Mutually known en-
tities, said to be in negative focus, were deaccented;
entities in the current task space, in referring focus,
received (possibly contrastive) accenting; and enti-
ties of the same type as a previously mentioned ob-
ject, were classified-as in either referring or emphatic
focus, depending on the dialogue act_ In the cases
of corrective situations or repeated system-intitiated
queries, the contrasting or corrective items were em-
phatically accented.
The BRIDGE project on speech generation
(Zacharski et al., 1992) identified four main factors
affecting accentability: linear order, lexical category,
semantic weight and givenness. In related work
(Monaghan, 1994), word accentability was quanti-
tatively scored by hand-crafted rules based on infor-
mation status, semantic focus and Word class. The
givenness hierarchy of Gundel and colleagues (1989),
which associates lexical forms of expression with in-
formation statuses, was divided into four intervals,
with scores assigned to each. A binary semantic fo-
cus score was based on whether the word occurred
in the topic or comment of a,sentence. Finally, lex-
ical categories determined word cl.s.s. scores, These
scores were combined, and metrical phonological
rules then referred to final accentability scores to
assign a final accenting pattern.
To summarize, all of the above CTS systems em-
ploy either hand-crafted or heuristic techniques for
representing semantic and discourse focus informa-
tion. Further, only SUNDIAL makes use of dialogue
acts.

We are presently carrying out evaluations of MIMIC-
CTS. An initial corpus-based analysis compares
the prosodic annotations assigned to three ac-
tual MIMIC dialogues, which were previously col-
lected during an overall system evaluation (Chu-
Carroll and Nickerson, 2000). The corpus of di-
alogues is made up of 37 system/user turns, in-
cluding 40 system-generated sentences. Three ver-
sions of the MIMIC dialogues are being analysed,
with prosodic features arising from three differ-

ent sources: MIMIC-CTS, MIMIC operating with
default, Bell Labs TTS, and a professional voice
talent who read the dialogue scripts in context.
This corpus-based assessment --- comparing the
prosody of CTS-generated, TTS-generated, and hu-
man speech, will enable more domain-dependent
tuning of the MIMIC-CTS algorithms, as well as the
refinement of general prosodic patterns for linguis-
tic structures, such as lists and conjunctive phrases.
Ultimately, the value of MIMIC-CTS must be mea-
sured based on its contribution to overall task pefor-
mance by real MIMIC users. Such a study is under
design, following (Chu-Carroll and Nickerson, 2000).
In conclusion, we have shown how prosodic com-
putation can be conditioned on various dialogue
representa,tions, for robust and domain-independent
CIS synthesis. - While- some rules for prosody as-
signment depend on the task model, others must be
tied closely to the particular choices of content in
the replies, at the level of dialogue goals and dia-
logue acts. .At this level as well, however, linguis-
tic principles of intonation interpretation can be ap-
plied to determine the mappings. In sum, the lesson
learned is that a unitary notion of &amp;quot;concept&amp;quot; from
which we. generate a unitary prosodic structure, does
not apply to state-of-the-art spoken dialogue gener-
ation. Instead, the representation of dialogue mean-
ing in experimental architectures, such as MIMIC&apos;s,
is compositional to some degree, and we take advan-
tage of this fact to implement a compositional theory
of intonational meaning in a new concept-to-speech
system, MIMIC-CTS.

Specifically, the semantic interpretation, task modeling and dialogue strategy modules in a working spoken dialogue system are used to generate prosodic features to better convey the meaning of system replies. The new CTS system embodies and extends theoretical work on intonational meaning in a more general, robust and rigorous way than earlier approaches, by reflecting compositional aspects of both dialogue and intonation interepretation in an original computational framework for prosodic generation.</abstract>

This corpus-based assessment --- comparing the prosody of CTS-generated, TTS-generated, and human speech, will enable more domain-dependent tuning of the MIMIC-CTS algorithms, as well as the refinement of general prosodic patterns for linguistic structures, such as lists and conjunctive phrases. Ultimately, the value of MIMIC-CTS must be measured based on its contribution to overall task peformance by real MIMIC users. Such a study is under design, following (Chu-Carroll and Nickerson, 2000). In conclusion, we have shown how prosodic computation can be conditioned on various dialogue representa,tions, for robust and domain-independent CIS synthesis. - While- some rules for prosody assignment depend on the task model, others must be tied closely to the particular choices of content in the replies, at the level of dialogue goals and dialogue acts. .At this level as well, however, linguistic principles of intonation interpretation can be applied to determine the mappings.

Together, MIMIC-CTS&apos;s computation of accentuation, pitch accent type and dialogue prosody constitutes the most general and complete implementation of a compositional theory of intonational meaning in a CTS system to date. Nevertheless, elements of a handful of previous CTS systems support the approaches taken in MIMIC-CTS toward conveying semantic, task and dialogue level meaning. For example, the Direction Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a discourse structure for generated directions. The discourse structure determined accentuation, with deaccenting of discourse-old entities realized (by lexically identical morphs) in the current or previous discourse segment. Other material was assigned accentuation based on lexical category information, with the exception that certain contrastive cases of accenting, such as left versus right, were stipulated for the domain. Accent assignment in the SUNDIAL travel information system (House and Youd, 1990) also relied on discourse and task models. Mutual</context>

Finally, phrase accents and boundary tones were said to reflect aspects of discourse structure. 3 Systems Foundations Our task is to improve the communicative competence of a spoken dialogue agent, by making recourse to our knowledge of intonational meaning, dialogue processing and relations between the two. Of course, a worthwhile CTS system must also outperform out-of-the-box text-to-speech (TTS) systems that may determine prosodic mark-up in linguistically sophisticated ways. As in (Nakatani, 1998), we take the prosodic output of an advanced research system that implements the Pierrehumbert theory of intonation, namely the Bell Labs TTS system, as our baseline experimental system to be enhanced by CTS algorithms. We embed the CTS system in MIMIC, a working spoken dialogue system representing state-of-the-art dialogue management practices, to develop CTS algorithms that can be eventually realistically evaluated using task-based performance metrics. 3.1 Dialogue System: Mixed-Initiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) The dialogue system whose baseline speech generation capabilities </context>

Of relevance is the fact that various pitch accent types, phrase accent and boundary tones in Pierrehumbert&apos;s theory are directly implemented in this system, so that by generating a Pierrehumbert-style prosodic transcription, the work of the CTS system is done. More precisely, MIMIC-CTS computes prosodic annotations that override the default prosodic processing that is performed by the Bell Labs TTS system. To our knowledge, the intonation component of the Bell Labs TTS system utilizes more linguistic knowledge to compute prosodic annotations than any other unrestricted TTS system, so it is </context>

Mutually known entities, said to be in negative focus, were deaccented; entities in the current task space, in referring focus, received (possibly contrastive) accenting; and entities of the same type as a previously mentioned object, were classified-as in either referring or emphatic focus, depending on the dialogue act_ In the cases of corrective situations or repeated system-intitiated queries, the contrasting or corrective items were emphatically accented. The BRIDGE project on speech generation (Zacharski et al., 1992) identified four main factors affecting accentability: linear order, lexical category, semantic weight and givenness. In related work (Monaghan, 1994), word accentability was quantitatively scored by hand-crafted rules based on information status, semantic focus and Word class. The givenness hierarchy of Gundel and colleagues (1989), which associates lexical forms of expression with information statuses, was divided into four intervals, with scores assigned to each. A binary semantic focus score was based on whether the word occurred in the topic or comment of a,sentence. Finally, lexical cate</context>
