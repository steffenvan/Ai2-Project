Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.993650944444444">
The relation between vocabulary size
(V(N)) and the text size (N) has been re-
examined, where the text has been pre-
sented as binary sequence. Six different
texts by three authors from different pe-
riods were taken from the Corpus of Ser-
bian Language to be analyzed. Statistics
included regression analysis, randomness
test for binary sequence and stochastic
models. Point of equivalence, where
number of new and old words is equal,
has been proposed as characteristic con-
stant of the text. This constant is inde-
pendent on N and could be used as an
index of vocabulary richness.
Key-words: vocabulary size, text size,
binary sequence, characteristic constant
of the text.

The text of defined size contains m words (to-
kens) and n different word entries (types). The
size in word tokens we denote as N and refer to
as the text size, while the number of types in a
sample of N tokens we denote as V(N) and refer
to as the vocabulary size. It is a well known fact
that an increase in N is paralleled by a non-linear
cumulative increase in V(N). Figure 1 depicts
typical cumulative non-linear relation between N
and V(N). The same type of function is observed
in a number of studies related to the statistical
analyses of word and/or text data like, for exam-

pie, Zipf&apos;s distribution (Zipf, 1935; 1949; cf.
Kunz, 1988), empirical structural type distribu-
tion and structural type distribution etc. (cf.
Baayen, 2001).
This study reexamines the relation between
the vocabulary size (V(N)) and the text size (N),
questing for the characteristic constant of the text
that moderates the relation between V(N) and N.
The relevance of this constant is twofold. On one
hand, it could be used for comparing vocabulary
size of various texts, authors, functional styles
etc. On the other hand, it could serve as a useful

tool for designing and building corpora, because
it allows for selection of texts with higher num-
ber of different lemmata. Also, capturing the
possible regularity in relation between V(N) and
N allows for extrapolation which may provide us
with prediction of the vocabulary size from the
smaller text samples.
Generally, V(N) has been considered to be de-
pendent on N. Baayen (2001) discusses various
text constants which model this regularity like
the Herdan&apos;s power model (1964), the Guiraud&apos;s
square-root model as its special case (1954), the
Honore&apos;s logarithmic model (1979) etc. How-
ever, as Baayen and other authors (e.g. Kostie,
A., Zec, Milin and Ilie, 2002) concluded, the
proposed constants suffer from heavy depend-
ence on N, i.e. they vary in a systematic fashion.
As a consequence, prediction of V(N) from N is
not reliable.
In their recent study Yang, Gomez and Song
(2000) proposed a piecewise curve-fitting ap-
proach as a method which presupposes (and thus
controls) the dependence of V(N) on N. They
started with the Heaps&apos; power model (1978),
identical to Herdan&apos;s (1964):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.817541">
V(N)= a • Nb (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918689655172">
The curve (N vs. V(N)) has been cut into
pieces, and the constants (a and b) recalculated
for each segment in order to obtain better regres-
sive fit. However, they have left two questions
unanswered: (a) in how many pieces should the
curve be cut and (b) where should it be cut. The
first question is related to the problem of inverse
relation between the number of cuts and the de-
grees of freedom, where the increase in number
of pieces increases the goodness-of-fit, but de-
creases the number of degrees of freedom. The
second question appertains the need for external
criterion for the points of cuts. Without an exter-
nal criterion, cuts appear to be arbitrary. As a
result, there is an inevitable decrease of inter-
pretability.
It should be noted that Yang, Gomez and Song
(2000) had only practical considerations in mind,
like corpus predictability, compiling methodol-
ogy, linguistic comprehensiveness etc. They had
no concern about characteristic constant of the
text, indirectly showing that the constant is de-
pendent on N, because it has to be recalculated
for each segment of the text.
In the present study we propose an alternative
constant which is not dependent on N, and which
could be used as an index of vocabulary richness.
Some aspects of the problem of extrapolation
will be indirectly addressed as well.

2 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999631625">
Instead of analyzing cumulative data, we take
binary digits as the simplest, nontrivial way to
distinguish the new words from the old words in
the text, where 1 stands for a new-word entry,
and -1 for an old-word entry. Consequently, the
text can be presented as a binary sequence. Note
that typical cumulative distribution could easily
be reconstructed from this sequence.

2.1 Sample
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995153846154">
The sample was taken from the Corpus of
Serbian Language (Kostie, D., 2001;
http://www.serbian-corpus.edu.yu). The Corpus
consists of 11 million words and spans Serbian
language from the 12th century to the contempo-
rary language. Each word in the Corpus is manu-
ally annotated up to the level of inflective
morphology. The system of annotation distin-
guishes more than 2000 grammatical forms. In
order to test whether the distribution of new
lemmata is dependent on the epoch, author or
sample size, six different texts by three authors
from different periods were analyzed.

2.2 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919888888889">
Several statistical procedures have been ap-
plied in order to explore variation in the textual
binary sequence. In addition to usual descriptive
statistics and regressive approach, some non-
standard procedures have been used too. They
derive from different fields of mathematics, like
stochastic processes (cf. Cox and Miller, 1978;
Grinstead and Snell, 1997) and cryptology (cf.
Stevens, 1996).

The textual time (N) is given on x-axis, while

binary sequence that could be called &amp;quot;text-

processes. A point where the text-particle

as the point of equivalence. It specifies the posi-
tion in a given text with equal number of new
and old words. Table 2 present values of points
of equivalence for six different texts and total

The correlation between the points of equiva-
lence and the vocabulary size (V(N)) for a fixed
text size (N = 12000) is r = 0.81; p 0.05. This
outcome suggests that the point of equivalence
may be taken as an index of vocabulary richness.
Inspection of Table 2 indicates that all values of
the points of equivalence appear within a sample
smaller than 1000 words. Hence, 1000 words
could be taken as a departure point from which
number of new words tends linearly towards
negative infinity.

In order to see whether extrapolation is possi-
ble in principle, non-randomness of the textual
binary sequences, as necessary logical condition,
has been tested. Clearly, the infinite linear in-
crease of new words is not realistic because there
is a limited number of different word entries in
language. Therefore, possible extrapolation
should be taken as being tentative. The outcome
of the analyses indicates that none of the six tex-
tual binaries had satisfied the first and the weak-
est of the three Golomb&apos;s randomness postulates
for the binary sequence of period p (cf. Stevens,
1996): If p is even then the length of p shall con-
tain equal number of ones and zeros. If p is odd,
the number of zeros shall be one more or one
less than the number of ones. As expected, the
texts contain many more old-words than new-
words. Hence, according to Golomb, it could not
be random. Additional statistical tests for ran-
domness of the binary sequence — Frequency
test, Serial test, Runs test and Poker test, were
applied (Stevens, 1996). All of them confirmed
that textual binaries are not random.
Although the tests for randomness proved that
the text is not &amp;quot;white noise&amp;quot;, i.e. that there is
some structure in relation between (V(N)) and N,
they tell nothing about the possibility to extrapo-
late the vocabulary size from the given text size.
To address this question directly, simple random
walk model has been applied (Cox and Miller,
1978; Grinstead and Snell, 1997). Probability
that the text-particle is in state j at time n has
been calculated. In other words, the probability
that in the text new-words (a) and old-words (b)
have been realized at time n, wherej = a - b, with
fixed probabilities of new-word (p) and old-word
(q) is to occur:

pectation for X„ (E(X)) and 0(y) is the standard
normal distribution function.
The outcome of this analysis indicated that the
text, specified as a binary sequence, does not
belong to a class of random walk stochastic
processes. Basically, probabilities of new-word
(p) and old-word (q) to occur are constantly
changing through the textual time (N). At the
beginning p &gt; q, followed by a period of N where
p q, and finally p &lt; q, when N&gt; 1000 and N —&gt;

The point of equivalence, i.e. the text size
where the number of new-words and old-words
is equal, could be used as a constant that is not
dependent on the text size (N). The respective
point indicates an influx of old-words: the slower
the influx, the higher the point of equivalence.
This, on the other hand, implies higher vocabu-
lary richness, which was empirically confirmed.
However, the point of equivalence as a measure
of vocabulary richness has one serious defi-
ciency. Since it is reached very early in the tex-
tual time, it could be insensitive to the late
changes in the text and, particularly, to the influx
of new-words late in the text. Therefore, com-
plementary measure is required.
As shown earlier, when V(N) is regressed on N
(for N &gt; 1000), almost perfect correlation has
been observed for the six samples. Theoretically,
if all words for N&gt; 1000 were old-words, R2 = 1
and slope b = -1. Hence, smaller b indicates
higher influx of new-words late in the text.
Therewith, b is not used in a standard manner,
but rather as an index of the late-text vocabulary
richness. Table 4 summarizes values of the total
text size (N) and the vocabulary size (V(N)), the
points of equivalence, R2 and b, for the six sam-
ples.
The correlation between the point of equiva-
lence and b is r = 0.79; p 0.05. This suggests
that they could be taken as the complement
measures of vocabulary richness.
Still, further analyses are mandatory, and three
things need to be done: (1) Sample size should
be increased in order to enhance the reliability of
findings; (2) Number of samples should be in-
creased too, in order to increase the test-power in
regression analysis; (3) It should be examined to
what extent slope (b) is dependent on N. In addi-
tion, it would be interesting to examine relation
between the peak (X, = max) of the textual bi-
nary function, the point of equivalence and b. If
the peak and the point of equivalence determine
b, then the vocabulary richness of the late text
could be expressed by those two points.
While the point of equivalence could be taken
as a coarse index of the vocabulary richness
which needs further examination, extrapolation,
i.e. prediction of the vocabulary richness based
on the textual binary sequence does not seem
possible. Although the textual binary sequence is
not random, probabilities of new-words and old-
words are changing across textual time, indicat-
ing that they are dependent on N. This brings us
back to the conclusions made by Baayen (2001)
and also Kostie, A. et al. (2002) about various
models based on cumulative distribution, i.e. that
there is substantial variability in all of the pro-
posed constants of the text. This variability could
be inherent to a given measure, or it can be re-
lated to the discourse organization of the text.
Finally, it can be even a combination of forego-
ing factors (Baayen, 2001).

To summarize, there are serious doubts about
a possibility to predict vocabulary richness from
the text size. On one hand, approaches based on
the cumulative distribution have failed. They are
erroneous, even the most sophisticated ones like
parametric models (Baayen, 2001), while the
piecewise curve-fitting approach suffers from
idiosyncrasy. On the other hand, the results ob-
tained on the random walk model suggest that
more powerful stochastic models, like Markov&apos;s
chains, would probably also fail.

Clearly, the infinite linear increase of new words is not realistic because there is a limited number of different word entries in language. Therefore, possible extrapolation should be taken as being tentative. The outcome of the analyses indicates that none of the six textual binaries had satisfied the first and the weakest of the three Golomb&apos;s randomness postulates for the binary sequence of period p (cf. Stevens, 1996): If p is even then the length of p shall contain equal number of ones and zeros. If p is odd, the number of zeros shall be one more or one less than the number of ones. As expected, the texts contain many more old-words than newwords. Hence, according to Golomb, it could not be random. Additional statistical tests for randomness of the binary sequence — Frequency test, Serial test, Runs test and Poker test, were applied (Stevens, 1996). All of them confirmed that textual binaries are not random. Although the tests for randomness proved that the text is not &amp;quot;white noise&amp;quot;, i.e. that there is so</context>
