Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999806">
Our general research aim is to extract the
actual intentions of persons when they
respond to open-ended questionnaires.
These intentions include the desire to
make requests, complaints, expressions of
resignation and so forth, but here we
focus on extracting the intention to make
a request. To do so, we first have to judge
whether their responses contain the intent
to make a request. Therefore, as a first
step, we have developed a criterion for
judging the existence of request intentions
in responses. This criterion, which is
based on paraphrasing, is described in
detail in this paper. Our assumption is that
a response with request intentions can be
paraphrased into a typical request
expression, e.g., “I would like to ...”,
while responses without request are not
paraphrasable. The criterion is evaluated
in terms of objectivity, reproducibility and
effectiveness. Objectivity is demonstrated
by showing that machine learning
methods can learn the criterion from a set
of intention-tagged data, while
reproducibility, that the judgments of
three annotators are reasonably consistent,
and effectiveness, that judgments based
not on the criterion but on intuition do not
agree. This means the criterion is
necessary to achieve reproducibility.
These experiments indicate that the
criterion can be used to judge the
existence of request intentions in
responses reliably.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929210526316">
In every aspect of society, it is necessary for us
to “know what the request is.” This is because
knowing what the request is plays an important
role in allowing us to identify and solve problems
to achieve improvements.
In recent years, the spread of electronic devices
such as personal computers and the Internet has
allowed us to save most requests in machine-
readable texts. On the basis of these texts, research
and development have been conducted “to know
what the request is” as an element technology in
natural language processing. For example, the
research includes text mining (Nasukawa, 2001)
and information extraction (Tateno, 2003) for
customer claims and inquiries, development of an
FAQ generation support system to a call center
(Yanase et al., 2002; Matsuzawa, 2002), an FAQ
navigation system using Q&amp;A stored a call center
(Matsui, 2002), and the development of
requirement capturing methods for extracting
requests made in meetings for software
development (Doi, 2003). However, “to know
what the request is” means to know the intention of
various people in society such as residents, users,
customers and patients, and it is inadequate to
extract only request expressions expressed literally
in texts. For this reason, previous works are not
sufficient to understand intentions.
Against this background, (Inui et al., 1998; Inui
et al., 2001; Inui and Isahara, 2002) have been
studying how to extract and classify request
intentions of respondents from responses of open-
ended questionnaires (OEQs) which are
accumulated requests. This paper describes the
development of a criterion for judging request
intentions and an evaluation of the criterion in
terms of objectivity, reproducibility and
effectiveness.

2.1 Problems of an existing theory of
modality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992595">
Response texts of OEQs are the focus of attention
as data for text mining. Researchers have tried to
extract various types of information from those
texts (Lebart et al., 1998; Li and Yamanishi, 2001;
Osumi and Lebart, 2000; Takahashi, 2000).
However, they have mainly used only keywords
(mostly nouns) as the basic units of extraction. If
only the characteristic key words are analyzed with
regard to sentences such as “Company A’s beer
tastes good,” “Company A’s beer does not seem to
taste good,” and “Company B’s beer tastes better
than company A’s,” the attention is directed
toward “company A/company B/beer/tastes/good,”
and it is not possible to differentiate the meaning
of the passages.
Because of this, as (Toyoda, 2002) points out,
text mining in the future needs to treat modality,
which often changes the meaning of the sentences
completely. Two separate studies (Inui et al., 1998;
Morohashi et al., 1998) have tried to process texts
using words like auxiliary verbs and auxiliary verb
equivalents as modality information. The modality
information focused on in both studies, however, is
grammatical expressions that have been accepted
in a previous Japanese language study. Therefore,
it is not possible to mechanically interpret requests
and questions displayed by respondents, speakers
and writers if they don’t contain an auxiliary verb
or an auxiliary verb equivalent.
In Japanese language syntax, modality is
defined as the intention of the writer that is
represented by grammatical expressions expressed
grammatically (Nitta and Masuoka ed., 1989) and
typically appears in the form of particles and
auxiliary verbs in the sentence structure. Although
previous text mining has focused on these
expressions, modality does not always appear in
the forms of grammatical expressions, and other
expressions are more frequently used in real world
texts. Thus, processing only those grammatical
expressions listed so far is not sufficient for
extracting intentions, and it is necessary to have a
wide coverage of modality that expresses
intentions.

2.2 Criterion to judge request intentions
using paraphrasing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959425">
Surveyors try to know request intentions on the
respondents through questionnaires, and
respondents try to convey their request intentions
to surveyors by responding to questionnaires.
Therefore, it is important to establish a method that
can extract the request intentions of the
respondents based on the expressions given in the
response texts. In this section, we propose a
criterion to judge the existence of request
intentions.
First, we will analyze the request expressions
deductively. Native Japanese speakers can
recognize expressions such as te-hoshii (would like
you to), te-moraitai (would like you to), te-kudasai
(please do) and te-kure (do) as request. These are
linguistically called direct request expressions

(NIJLA, 1960) and able to indicate request
intentions. Especially, te-hoshii is a typical request
expression.
In other words, these direct request expressions
are a clue to understand that there is a request
intended. This recognition process is equivalent to
the first judgment in Fig.1, that is, “whether a
response can be judged to be a request by linguistic
intuition or not.” We regarded this as the first level
criterion to judge request intentions. It corresponds
to the first level in Fig.2, the intent of which is
equal to judge whether the response includes a
direct request expression or not.
Second, we consider the case that a response
does not contain a direct request expression. In this
case, non-requests in Fig.1 may be judged as
requests. For example, based on the relation with
surveyors, respondents and the situation,
“Guardrails should be built along sidewalks of
heavily congested roads” and “Building eco-
friendly roads is important” can be interpreted as
“We want guardrails along the sidewalks” and
“We want you to think about the environment.”
However, the interpretation is due to “some”
implicit criterion as shown in the second judgment
in Fig. 1. As the implicit criterion depends on the
judges, it is possible that the judgments differ1.
This means that the results of the judgment,
namely request ② in Fig. 1, are not re-created
consistently. Therefore, the second judge in Fig.1
is not reproducible.
Consequently we attempted to manifest the
implicit criterion as an explicit criterion to judge
the existence of request intentions. This
manifestation is the criterion “whether a response
can be paraphrased into a sentence containing te-
hoshii as a typical request expression or not” as the
second judge in Fig. 2. As this criterion is explicit,
the judgment of the criterion does not depend on
the judges and agree consistently. Therefore, the
second judge in Fig.2, namely the proposed
criterion is reproducible and the results of the
judgment, namely the expression of request
intentions in Fig.2 is re-created consistently2.
As mentioned above, we propose a criterion for
judging request intentions by paraphrasing a
response sentence into a typical request sentence

contained te-hoshii. In Section 3, we evaluate the
proposed criterion by a single judge analytically
and objectively. In Section 4, we evaluate the
results of experiments conducted by different
judges from the viewpoint of reproducibility and
effectiveness. These evaluations enable to
demonstrate that the criterion, namely paraphrasing
is an important method to determine the intentions
independent of variety of surface expressions and
differences among individual judgments.

paraphrase them into a sentence ending with te-
hoshii. To make the judgment for (1), we used
request expressions listed by (Morita and Matsui,

expressions of request intentions in Fig.2 in
Section 2.2. These expressions are shown in Table
2. Line ④ includes non-request expressions.
Table 2 shows various forms of expressions
based on parts of speech (POS), i.e., verbs, nouns
and adjectives, that have not been considered
acceptable as modality expressions, even though
they are paraphrasable by te-hoshii, and thus they
are request expressions. As described in Section
2.1, several studies have been made on modality in
terms of particles, auxiliary verbs, and auxiliary
verb equivalents. However, little attention has been
given to other POS in this regard. This is because
modality expressions have been primarily
connected with the grammatical elements such as
auxiliary verbs in syntax. However, Table 2, which
lists expressions of request intentions, shows that
verbs, nouns and adjectives are actually also
important elements that express modality.
Previous works that aim to extract requests have
used pattern matching methods, and patterns that
mainly consist of the direct request expressions
corresponding to ① in Table 1. However, the
results of manual analysis for paraphrasability
shown in Table 2 indicate that using the proposed
criterion enables many expressions of request
intentions to be extracted from responses. In
addition, we found a tendency for the number of
expressions of request intentions direct request
expressions, as shown in Table 1. In this section,
we have provided explanation for the coverage of
the criterion by analyzing response texts.

This section shows that the possibility of

methods were tagged by the expert that analyzed
the data in Table 1. Our assumption is that if

said to have been tagged consistently enough to be
mechanically learnable. This indicates that the
criterion proposed in Section 2 is objectively
applicable to tag data.

We will compare three sets of features, F1, F2

word 1-grams, F2, 1-grams and 2-grams, and F3,
word 1-grams, 2-grams and 3-grams. For example,
let X be a response consisting of a word sequence5
w1, w1,....., wm where w1 = (b)and wm = (e)

the ending of a response. Let 51 be the set of 1-

{ wiwi+1 |1 &lt; i &lt; m-1} and 53, 3-grams in X

features contained in X are 51, 51U52, and 51U52
U53, respectively.
Experiments
The data used for the experiments consisted of
3,001 responses6. The numbers of the responses
tagged possible and impossible were 1,944 and
1,057, respectively. We used 10-fold cross
validation to evaluate the accuracies of ME and
SVM7. For each iteration in the cross validation,
8/10 of the data was used for training, 1/10, for
parameter adjustment, and 1/10, for testing. The
precision, Pi, for iteration i is
Pi = total number of answers in the test data
number of correctly tagged answers
We define P as the mean of the precisions for each
iterations, i.e., P = Ei Pi /10. We henceforth call P
precision. The precisions of ME and SVM are in
Table 3, together with a baseline precision 0.648
(=1944/3001), which was obtained by tagging all
the responses possible. In the table, the figures in

either ME or SVM as a machine learning method

Table 3 demonstrates that we can expect about

Section 2.2. If a response text included plural
sentences, they were separated into single
sentences as mentioned in Section 3.1. Of the

A and B, B and C, and A and C were each given
4,000 common sentences, so that a variation of
sentence totaled 12,000.
As shown in Table 1 in Section 3.1, direct

Generally, the closer the kappa coefficient is to
1, the higher the degree of agreement is obtained.
There is a complete agreement when it is 1. In
general, the ranges [0.81-1.00], [0.61-0.80], [0.41-
0.60], [0.21-0.40] and [0.00-0.20] correspond to
full, practical, medium, low, and no agreement,
respectively.
Therefore, as Table 4 indicates, the results of the
judging and the paraphrasing using the criterion by
the three subjects showed that there was substantial
agreement between subject A and C, and medium
agreement between A and B, and B and C.
These results indicate that the method based on
the criterion, whether used by a single judge or by
different judges(=subjects) for analysis and
experiment, enables requests and non-requests to
be distinguished. Therefore, we can conclude that
using the criterion enables even untrained people
to reproduce the extraction of requests.
Sentences such as #2 and #3 below are
examples of sentences that were agreed to be non-
paraphrasable. These include expressions of
intentions in which the current situation is accepted
passively such as #2 ”しょうがない(I think that it cannot
be helped),” or in which the current situation is
actively accepted such as #3 ” 素 晴 ら し い (are
wonderful)”. Furthermore, #4 is a sentence that
begins with a clear statement of reason “理由は
(the reason is).” This indicates that a motive for
requests exists, and that a response formed by
multiple sentences often composes request-motive
adjacency in discourse structure.
Examples of sentences that could not be
paraphrased:
#2 必要があれば料金の値上げもしょうがないと
思う。(I think that it cannot be
helped if rise in charges is
necessary.)
#3 車いすの人でも、楽にあちこち一人で買い
物や散歩ができる町、道路で素晴らしい (The
town and roads are wonderful as even
people in wheelchairs can do
shopping by themselves here and
there with ease and wander about.)
#4 理由は全体的な発展が望めないので。(The
reason is that overall development
cannot be hoped for.)
This analysis shows that paraphrasable sentences

shows requests or not without the criterion. The
two subjects, D and E, who took part in this
experiment were both native speakers of Japanese.
Subject D was a male student in his twenties from
the education department of a university, and
subject E was a female student also in her twenties
from the literature department of a university. They
used the same data of 4,000 sentences that were
used by the subjects B and C in Section 4.1. The
subjects D and E did not consult with each other
and carried out the work separately. We provided
them with the following instructions before asking
them to start the work.

<listItem confidence="0.999326">
• Each response sentence is context-free.
• Judge intuitively, and mark 1 if you think the
sentence shows a request, and mark 0 if you
do not .

The results of the experiment are given in Table
5, where 1 and 0 in the right table correspond to P
and NP in Table 4. We show the data again
because subjects B and C used the same data as
subjects D and E. In Table 5, the kappa coefficient
(KC), between D and E is lower than that between
B and C. Moreover, it is the lowest among all those
given in Tables 4 and 5. The KC of 0.17 means
there is no agreement between D and E.
The results indicate the rate of agreement is
higher for judgments made using the criterion than
for subjective judgments. That is to say, this proves
the effectiveness of the criterion.

We examine here mainly the cases in which no
agreement was obtained with respect to
paraphrasing in the experiment described in
Section 4.1. Table 4 shows the cases where
disagreement was considerable. The results for
these cases, shown in Table 6, indicate that
disagreement is obtained when the sentences are
paraphrased into the forms including clauses of
cause and reason indicated by “node”(because) as
#5. The clause is underlined in the target sentence
in #5.

The source sentence #5 is a statement showing the
condition of the road being narrow. This statement
can be seen as a motive for a request in the target
sentence of #5. That is to say, the source sentence
#5 itself shows not the content of a request but the
“motive for request.” The three subjects disagreed
in their judgments on whether or not the “motive
for request” sentence was paraphrasable as shown
in the bottom line of Table 6. As the table indicates,
disagreement rates of 64.4%, 51.5%, and 9.0%
were obtained between A and B, A and C, and B
and C. The reason for these high disagreement
rates was that we did not give clear directions in
the work instructions. The sentences which the
paraphrasing includes “node” are not requests and
should not be extracted. This means these
sentences should have been considered to be non-
paraphrasable.
On the other hand, with regard to “motive for
request” sentences, there was an example #1 in
Section 4.1 in which the work instructions
requested the subjects to paraphrase such a
sentence. That is, the work instructions suggested
that the source sentence #1 “I think that we do not
have enough car parks” is a motive for the request
“I want car parks to be increased.” This kind of
inadequate instruction led to instability in the work
done and might have increased the disagreement
rates obtained in the judgment.
However, according to the data prepared by the
expert referred to in Section 3.2, “motive for
request” sentences cannot be paraphrased into te-
hoshii, and machine learning has confirmed that
the data are objective. Therefore, it can be
considered that the work of removing “motive for
requests” sentences can be done stably. This means

sentence, that sentence should be regarded not as a

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999296875">
We have developed a criterion for judging request
intentions. We evaluated this criterion from three
points of view. The first evaluation was to analyze
the data applying the criterion by a single judge.
From this analysis, it was found that this criterion
makes it possible to extract requests and that the
coverage can be guaranteed compared with
previous studies. Moreover, a corpus was prepared
based on the analysis and was used for a machine
learning experiment. From this experiment results,
we confirmed the criterion using a paraphrase was
objective.
Furthermore, by different judges, the second
evaluation was made from the experiment
conducted by three subjects. The rate of agreement
for the paraphrasability was high, which indicated
that the results of requests extraction were re-
created using the criterion. This proves the
reproducibility of the criterion.
In the third experiment, two subjects judged the
sentences without using the criterion to see
whether or not there was a request in each response
sentence. A comparison of the results of the second
and the third experiments showed that a higher rate
of agreement was obtained with the method using
the criterion. This confirmed the effectiveness of
the criterion.
In future work, we will analyze “motives for
request” sentences found from the examinations,
and prepare a criterion for distinguishing between
request motives and the contents of request
intentions.

<abstract confidence="0.999080472222223">Our general research aim is to extract the actual intentions of persons when they respond to open-ended questionnaires. These intentions include the desire to make requests, complaints, expressions of resignation and so forth, but here we focus on extracting the intention to make a request. To do so, we first have to judge whether their responses contain the intent to make a request. Therefore, as a first step, we have developed a criterion for judging the existence of request intentions in responses. This criterion, which is based on paraphrasing, is described in detail in this paper. Our assumption is that a response with request intentions can be paraphrased into a typical request expression, e.g., “I would like to ...”, while responses without request are not paraphrasable. The criterion is evaluated in terms of objectivity, reproducibility and effectiveness. Objectivity is demonstrated by showing that machine learning methods can learn the criterion from a set of intention-tagged data, while reproducibility, that the judgments of three annotators are reasonably consistent, and effectiveness, that judgments based not on the criterion but on intuition do not agree. This means the criterion is necessary to achieve reproducibility. These experiments indicate that the criterion can be used to judge the existence of request intentions in responses reliably.</abstract>

For example, the research includes text mining (Nasukawa, 2001) and information extraction (Tateno, 2003) for customer claims and inquiries, development of an FAQ generation support system to a call center (Yanase et al., 2002; Matsuzawa, 2002), an FAQ navigation system using Q&amp;A stored a call center (Matsui, 2002), and the development of requirement capturing methods for extracting requests made in meetings for software development (Doi, 2003).

If only the characteristic key words are analyzed with regard to sentences such as “Company A’s beer tastes good,” “Company A’s beer does not seem to taste good,” and “Company B’s beer tastes better than company A’s,” the attention is directed toward “company A/company B/beer/tastes/good,” and it is not possible to differentiate the meaning of the passages. Because of this, as (Toyoda, 2002) points out, text mining in the future needs to treat modality, which often changes the meaning of the sentences completely. Two separate studies (Inui et al., 1998; Morohashi et al., 1998) have tried to process texts using words like auxiliary verbs and auxiliary verb equivalents as modality information. The modality information focused on in both studies, however, is grammatical expressions that have been accepted in a previous Japanese language study. Therefore, it is not possible to mechanically interpret requests and questions displayed by respondents, speakers and writers if they don’t contain an auxiliary verb or an auxiliary verb equivalent. In Japanese language syntax, modality is defined as the intention of the writer that is represented by grammatical expressions expr</context>

In recent years, the spread of electronic devices such as personal computers and the Internet has allowed us to save most requests in machinereadable texts. On the basis of these texts, research and development have been conducted “to know what the request is” as an element technology in natural language processing. For example, the research includes text mining (Nasukawa, 2001) and information extraction (Tateno, 2003) for customer claims and inquiries, development of an FAQ generation support system to a call center (Yanase et al., 2002; Matsuzawa, 2002), an FAQ navigation system using Q&amp;A stored a call center (Matsui, 2002), and the development of requirement capturing methods for extracting requests made in meetings for software development (Doi, 2003). However, “to know what the request is” means to know the intention of various people in society such as residents, users, customers and patients, and it is inadequate to extract only request expressions expressed </context>

This paper describes the development of a criterion for judging request intentions and an evaluation of the criterion in terms of objectivity, reproducibility and effectiveness. 2 Development of the criterion for judging request intentions 2.1 Problems of an existing theory of modality Response texts of OEQs are the focus of attention as data for text mining. Researchers have tried to extract various types of information from those texts (Lebart et al., 1998; Li and Yamanishi, 2001; Osumi and Lebart, 2000; Takahashi, 2000). However, they have mainly used only keywords (mostly nouns) as the basic units of extraction. If only the characteristic key words are analyzed with regard to sentences such as “Company A’s beer tastes good,” “Company A’s beer does not seem to taste good,” and “Company B’s beer tastes better than company A’s,” the attention is directed toward “company A/company B/beer/tastes/good,” and it is not possible to differentiate the meaning of the passages.
