The article notes certain weaknesses of
current efforts aiming at the standard-
ization of POS tagsets for morphologi-
cally rich languages and argues that, in
order to achieve clear mappings between
tagsets, it is necessary to have clear
and formal rules of delimiting POSs and
grammatical categories within any given
tagset. An attempt at constructing such
a tagset for Polish is presented.

<bodyText confidence="0.999524694444445">
The aim of this article is to address one of the ob-
jectives of the EACL 2003 workshop on Morpho-
logical Processing of Slavic Languages, namely,
to “try to reveal lexical structures necessary for
morphological analysis and... discuss standard-
ization efforts in the field that can, for instance,
enable transfer of applied methods from one lan-
guage to the other or inform the annotation of mor-
phological information in corpora.”
One admirable standardization effort in the field
of Slavic part of speech (POS) tagging has been
the Multext-East project (Erjavec, 2001), one of
whose aims was to construct mutually compati-
ble tagsets for 8 European languages, including 4
Slavic languages (originally Bulgarian, Czech and
Slovene, later extended to Croatian); additionally,
a Multext-East-style tagset for Russian was con-
structed at the University of Tübingen (http:
//www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/c1/
tagset.html). Those tagsets are based on a
common repertoire of grammatical classes (POSs;
e.g., ‘verb’, ‘noun’, ‘adjective’, etc.) and gram-
matical categories (e.g., ‘case’, ‘person’, ‘gender’,
etc.), and each tagset uses just a subset of those
grammatical classes and categories.
Despite the considerable success of Multext-
East, and the apparent uniformity of the result-
ing tagsets, certain weaknesses of this approach
are clear. First of all, the relative uniformity of
the POS classes across the 8 languages was at-
tained at the cost of introducing the grammatical
category ‘type’ whose values reflect the consider-
able differences between POS systems of the lan-
guages involved. Second, it is not clear that vari-
ous grammatical categories and their values have
the same interpretation in each language; for ex-
ample, it is rather surprising that only the Roma-
nian tagset explicitly mentions strong and weak
pronominal forms, it is not clear whether negative
pronouns in Romanian, Slovene, Czech and Bul-
garian are negative in the same sense of participat-
ing in Negative Concord, it is not clear why Roma-
nian has negative adverbs while, say, Czech lacks
them, etc. Finally, and most importantly from our
point of view, the approach adopted by Multext-
East does not clearly reflect cross-linguistic cor-
respondences, such as the one mentioned in (Er-
javec, 2001), that “in the Romanian case system
the value ‘direct’ conflates ‘nominative’ and ‘ac-
cusative’, while the value ‘oblique’ conflates ‘gen-
itive’ and ‘dative’.” Such correspondences are not
exceptional, e.g., the at least three masculine gen-
ders of Polish (Manczak, 1956; Saloni, 1976) are
mapped into the single masculine gender of many
other languages, the dual and the plural numbers
of some languages (Slovene, Czech) are mapped
to plural of other languages, etc.
In more general terms, we have identified the
following features of currently used tagsets for
Slavic in general and Polish in particular which
seem problematic from the point of view of their
reusability and cross-linguistic applicability:
uncritical adoption of traditional and some-
times ill-defined POS classes, such as ‘pro-
noun’ or vaguely delimited classes such as
‘verb’ or ‘noun’ (it is often not clear whether
gerunds are ‘verbs’ or ‘nouns’ in such classi-
fications);
POS classes and categories are often chosen
on the basis of a mix of morphological, syn-
tactic and semantic criteria, e.g., ‘gender’ in
Slavic is sometimes defined on the basis of
mixed morphosyntactic and semantic proper-
ties, and so are ‘pronoun’ and ‘numeral’;
mixing morphosyntactic annotation with
what might be called dictionary annotation;
e.g., tagsets often include tags for proper
names or morphosyntactically transparent
collocations, which — in our opinion — do
not belong to the realm of POS annotation;
sometimes the priorities of such mixed cri-
teria are unclear, e.g., should the preposition
of in District of Columbia be tagged as an
ordinary preposition, or should it have the
‘proper’ tag as it is a part of a proper name?
ignoring the finer points of the morphosyn-
tactic system of a given language, e.g.,
the multitude of genders in languages such
as Polish, or categories such as ‘post-
prepositionality’ and ‘accommodability’ (see
below);
unclear segmentation rules (should so-called
analytic tenses or reflexive verbs be treated as
single units for the purpose of annotation?).
The main thesis of this paper is that, in order for
a tagset to be reusable and comparable with simi-
lar tagsets for related languages, it must be based
on a homogeneous set of clear formal (morpho-
logical and morphosyntactic) criteria. Only once
such criteria for delimiting grammatical classes
and categories are presented in detail, can those
classes and categories be mapped to grammati-
cal classes and categories of other similarly con-
structed tagsets.
The remainder of the paper presents such a
tagset for Polish, developed within a Polish cor-
pus project1 and deployed by a stochastic tagger
of Polish (D˛ebowski, 2003).

The tagset presented in this section is based on the
following design assumptions:
what is being tagged is a single orthographic
word or, in some well-defined cases, a part
thereof; multi-word constructions, even those
sometimes considered to be morphological
formations (so-called analytic forms) or dic-
tionary entries (proper names), should be
considered by a different level of process-
ing;2 cf. 2.1;
grammatical categories reflect various oppo-
sitions in the morphological system, even
those oppositions which pertain to single
grammatical classes and are not recognized
by traditional grammars; cf. 2.2;
the main criteria for delimiting grammati-
cal classes are morphological (how a given
form inflects; e.g., nouns inflect for case,
but not for gender) and morphosyntactic (in
which categories it agrees with other forms;
e.g., Polish nouns do not inflect for gen-
der but they agree in gender with adjectives
and verbs); semantic criteria are eschewed;
cf. 2.3.

ments of texts which are subject to morphosyntac-
tic tagging. We propose the following guidelines
for segmentation (for a more complete discussion
see our other article in this volume):
tokens do not contain white space;
tokens either are punctuation marks or do not
contain any punctuation marks;
an exception to the previous guideline are
certain words containing the hyphen (e.g.,
mass-media, s-ka = an abbreviation of spółka
‘company’, etc.) and apostrophe used in Pol-
ish when inflecting foreign names (e.g. La-
grange’a); they are given by a list.
Those guidelines do not preculde the situation
where an orthographic word is split into several
POS tokens. For example, in the case of Polish
past tense finite verbs, the morpheme bearing in-
formation on person and number can be attached
to the verb itself (1a) or to some other word within
the sentence (1b). For that reason we always con-
sider such a ‘floating inflection’ morpheme as a
separate segment.3

Although we proposed ignoring some information
often present in tagsets, e.g., the ‘proper noun’ vs.
‘common noun’ distinction, we argue that mor-
phological categories should be taken seriously
and should be as detailed as possible.
What follows is the complete list of morpholog-
ical categories assumed in the proposed tagset:
number: sg, pl;
case: nom, acc, gen, dat, inst, loc, voc;
gender: masculine personal m1 (facet), mas-
culine animate m2 (ko´n), masculine inani-
mate m3 (stół), feminine f (kobieta, ˙zyrafa,

It may seem surprising, at first, to see 9 gender
values in an Indo-European language (as opposed
to, say, a Bantu language), but this position is well
argued for by (Saloni, 1976), who distinguishes
those genders on the basis of agreement with ad-
jectives and numerals;4 we will not attempt to fur-
ther justify this position here.
Negation is a category of various de-verbal
classes, e.g., participles. Since we assume that the
words pisz ˛acy ‘writing’ and niepisz ˛acy ‘not writ-
ing’ have the same lemma pisa´c ’to write’, these
words have to be distinguished with this morpho-
logical category.
The category of accentability is used to dif-
ferentiate accented forms of nominal pronouns
(e.g. jego, mnie) from weak forms (go, mi). It
roughly corresponds to the category of clitic used
in Multext-East.
Post-prepositionality is another category of
nominal pronouns. It differentiates special forms
4Elsewhere, we propose reducing the number of gen-
ders, essentially, by factoring out the number information
(Woli´nski, 2001) or the information about agreement with nu-
merals (Przepiórkowski et al., 2002), but for the purposes of
this tagset we assume the original repertoire of genders pro-
posed by Saloni.

-´n) from forms that can be used in other contexts
(jego, go).
The category of accomodability is important for
the description of Polish numeral-nominal phrase.
Some Polish numerals have forms that agree in
case with noun (marked congr), as well as forms
that require a noun in genitive case (marked rec):

The need for the category of agglutination is a
result of the way past tense verb forms are seg-
mented (cf. (1) in sec. 2.1). For the majority of
Polish verbs the form used for the first and the sec-
ond person is the same as the third person form:

Vocability distinguishes those ‘floating’ forms
of the verb by´c ‘to be’ which attach to consonant-
final forms (wok, e.g., -em) from the forms which
attach to vowel-final forms (nwok, e.g., -m).
Various non-standard categories used above,
such as post-prepositionality, accomodability and
agglutination, are based on important work by
Zygmunt Saloni and his colleagues (Saloni, 1976;
Saloni, 1977; Gruszczy´nski and Saloni, 1978;
Bie´n and Saloni, 1982).

2.3 Morphological Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993948097826087">
Morphological classes, or parts of speech, as-
sumed within various tagsets are usually taken
over more-or-less verbatim from traditional gram-
mars. For example, the Multext-East tagset for
Czech assumes the following parts of speech:
noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adverb, adposi-
tion, conjunction, numeral, interjection, resid-
ual, abbreviation and particle.
While tagsets based on such POSs are well-
grounded in linguistic tradition, they do not repre-
sent a logically valid classification of wordforms
in the sense that the criteria which seem to under-
lie these classes do not always allow to uniquely
classify a given word. We will support this criti-
cism with two examples.
Let us first of all consider the classes pronoun
and adjective. The former is morphosyntactically
very heterogeneous:
some pronouns inflect for gender (e.g., the
demonstrative pronoun ten, the possessive
pronoun mdj, but not the interrogative pro-
noun kto or the negative pronoun nikt);
some pronouns, but not all, inflect for per-
son;
some pronouns, but not all, inflect for num-
ber;
the short reflexive pronoun si˛e does not
overtly inflect at all, although it may be con-
strued as a weak form of the anaphoric pro-
noun siebie.
It seems that the class of pronouns is defined
mainly, if not solely, on the basis of semantic in-
tuition. On the other hand, adjectives are well-
defined morphosyntactically, as the forms inflect-
ing for gender, number and case, but not, say,
person or voice.
Now, according to these definitions, it is not
clear, whether so-called possessive pronouns, such
as mdj ‘my’ should be classified as pronouns or
adjectives: semantically they belong to the for-
mer class, while morphosyntactically — to the lat-
ter. (Traditionally, it is classified as a pronoun, of
course.)
Another, and perhaps more serious example
concerns so-called -nie/-cie gerunds, i.e., substan-
tiva verbalia (Puzynina, 1969) such as pi´c::picie
‘to drink::drinking’, browsowa´c::browsowanie ‘to
browse::browsing’.5 These are nominal forms in
the sense that they have gender (always n2) and
inflect for case and, potentially, for number, but
they are also productively related to verbs, have
the category of aspect and inflect for negation.
As such, they do not comfortably fit into the tradi-
tional class noun, whose members do not have as-
pect or negation, nor do they belong to the class
verb, whose members have no case. A similar
difficulty is encountered also in case of adjectival
participles, which — apart from the adjectival in-
flectional categories of gender, number and case
— also inflect for negation and have aspect.
For this reason, and following the general ap-
proach of (Saloni, 1974) and (Bie´n, 1991), we
propose to derive the notion of grammatical class
from the notion of flexeme introduced by Bie´n,
where flexeme is understood as a morphosyntac-
tically homogeneous set of forms belonging to the
same lexeme.
For example, a typical Polish verbal lexeme
contains a number of personal forms, a number
of impersonal forms, as well as, depending on
a particular understanding of the notion of lex-
eme, various deverbal forms, such as participles
and gerunds. These forms have very different
morphosyntactic properties: finite non-past tense
forms have the inflectional categories of person
and number, adjectival participles have the inflec-
tional properties of non-gradable adjectives and,
additionally, inflect for negation and have aspect,
gerunds inflect for case and, at least potentially, for
number, but not for person, etc. Ideally, flexemes
are subsets of such lexemes consisting of those
forms which have the same inflectional proper-
ties: all verbal forms of given lexeme with the
inflectional category of person and number are
grouped into one flexeme, other forms belong-
ing to this lexeme, but with adjectival inflectional
properties, are grouped into another flexeme, those
forms, which inflect for case but not for gender
are grouped into a gerundial flexeme, etc. Each of
such flexemes is characterized by a set of gram-
matical categories it inflects for and, perhaps, a set
of grammatical categories it has lexically set (e.g.,

dial derivational rule: browsowa´c is, of course, a very recent
borrowing.

<bodyText confidence="0.996641382352941">
the gender of nouns).
Now, given the notion of flexeme, it is natural
to define grammatical classes as flexemic classes,
i.e., classes of flexemes with the same inflec-
tional characteristics. For example, the grammat-
ical class non-past verb contains exactly those
flexemes which inflect for person and number,
and nothing else, and which also have the lexi-
cal category of aspect; the class noun contains ex-
actly those flexemes which inflect for number and
case, and have gender; the class gerund contains
exactly those flexemes which inflect for number,
case and negation, and have lexical gender (always
neuter, n2, in case of gerunds) and aspect; etc.
It should be noted that, despite the way flex-
emes have been defined above, the notion of lex-
eme is of only secondary importance here: it is
invoked for the purpose of assigning a lemma to a
given form (e.g., a gerundial form such as przyj´s-
ciem ‘coming-inst’ will be lemmatized to the in-
finitival form przyj´s´c ‘to come’: even though the
form przyj´s´c does not belong to the flexeme of
przyj´sciem, it does belong to the lexeme containing
przyj´sciem). Moreover, just as in case of decid-
ing whether two forms belong to the same lexeme,
also classification of two wordforms to the same
flexeme requires some semantic intuition: thus,
e.g., pies ‘dog-nom’ and psem ‘dog-inst’ belong
to the same (f)lexeme, and so do rok ‘year-sg’ and
lata ‘year-pl’, but pies ‘dog’ and suka ‘bitch’ do
not.
The basic classification of flexemes into gram-
matical (‘flexemic’) classes is given by the follow-
ing decision tree:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.8851816">

forms, adverbs, prepositions,
conjunctions)
Note that most of the classes in the ‘inflects
for case’ branch of the tree already are reason-
able POSs, i.e., they correspond to traditional
POSs (noun, adjective, numeral) or to their well-
defined subsets (nominal pronoun, gerund, ad-
jectival participle). It is important to realize,
however, that these classes are defined mainly on
the basis of the inflectional properties of their
members; e.g., the class numeral is much nar-
rower here than traditionally, as it does not include
so-called ordinal numerals (which, morphosyntac-
tically, are adjectives).
On the other hand, in the ‘does not inflect for
case’ branch, only the ‘inflects for gender’ class
corresponds to an intuitive set of forms, namely,
to so-called l-participles or past participles, i.e.,
verbal forms hosting ‘floating inflections’; cf.
powiedziała in (1) above.
The class 8. above can be further partitioned ac-
cording to the following criteria:
8. Has a ter (i.e., 3rd person) form?
YES: 8.1. non-past forms
NO: Has a prisg form?
YES: 8.2. agglutinate

<bodyText confidence="0.970776444444444">
NO: 8.3. imperative
Non-past verb forms correspond to present tense
for imperfective verbs (e.g., id˛e ‘I am going’) and
future tense for perfective ones (e.g., pójd˛e ‘I will
go’).
Further, we will remove from the class of nouns
the flexeme of the strong reflexive pronoun siebie,
which does not inflect for number and does not
have overt gender:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.387997333333333">
6. Inflects for number?
YES: 6.1. true noun
NO: 6.2. siebie
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9771085">
Moreover, inflectional class marked as 9. can
be further split according to non-inflectional mor-
phosyntactic properties of its members in the fol-
lowing way:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.528283">
9. Has aspect?
YES: 9.1. non-inflecting verbal forms
NO: Inflects for degree or derived

YES: 9.2. adverb
NO: 9.3. preposition, conjunction,
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.933820305555556">
etc.
In order to arrive at a class close to the traditional
class of adverbs, we had to define this class dis-
junctively; it should contain all adverbs inflecting
for degree, at least one of which does not seem
to be derived from an adjective (bardzo ‘very’), as
well as all de-adjectival adverbs, some of which
do not (synthetically) inflect for degree (e.g., anty-
wirusowo ‘anti-virus-like’, *antywirusowiej).
If our purpose were to define a purely flexemic
tagset for Polish, we would have to stop here (and
remove the ‘derived from adjective’ disjunct from
the subtree above). For example, it is impossible
to distinguish the impersonal -no/-to form, the in-
finitive, and adverbial participle of the same lex-
eme on the basis of their morphosyntactic prop-
erties alone: they all lack any inflectional cate-
gories and have the lexical category of aspect. For
this reason, we will further partition the class 9.1.
above on the basis of purely orthographic (or pho-
netic) information:
9.1. Ends in -no or -to?
YES: 9.1.1. impersonal -no/-to forms
(e.g., chodzono ‘one used to
walk/go’, pito ‘one used to
drink’)
NO: Ends in - ˛ac or -szy?
YES: 9.1.2. adverbial participle
(e.g., czytaj ˛ac ‘reading’,
przeczytawszy ‘having read’)
NO: 9.1.3. infinitive form (e.g.,
i´s´c ‘to go’); should end
in -c or -´c
Finally, the class 9.3. consists of those word-
forms which do not inflect, and do not have as-
pect, i.e.:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.824601333333333">
9.3.1. conjunction
9.3.2. preposition
9.3.3. particle-adverb
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.752811876923077">
The first two classes are closed classes, which can
be defined extensionally, by enumerating them.
All other non-inflecting, non-aspectual and non-
de-adjectival single-form flexemes fall into the
particle-adverb class.
The table on the next page presents the com-
plete repertoire of grammatical classes and their
respective inflectional (‘ ’) and lexical (‘ ’) cat-
egories. Some more ephemeral classes not men-
tioned in the decision tree are briefly described
below (a more complete description of a previous
version of this tagset is available in (Woli´nski and
Przepiórkowski, 2001)).
For Polish nouns of masculine personal (m1)
gender a stylistically marked form is possible be-
sides a ‘regular’ form for nominative and vocative

case in plural (e.g., profesory vs. profesorowie).
These special forms do not fit in the scheme of
regular nominal inflection, and so were moved to
a separate flexeme for depreciative noun.
Ad-adjectival adjectives are special forms of
adjectives used in compounds like angielsko-
polski ‘English-Polish’. Moreover, some adjec-
tives (e.g., polski) have a special form that is re-
quired after some prepositions (e.g., po polsku ‘in
Polish’). This form constitutes post-prepositional
adjective flexeme.
A few verbs (e.g., powinien ‘should’) inflect in
an atypical way and lack some verbal flexemes
(e.g., imperative and l-participle). Winien-like
flexeme gathers present tense forms of these verbs
(which accept ‘floating inflection’).
The class of predicatives consists of verbs
which do not inflect at all (e.g., warto ‘be worth’,
mo˙zna ‘can/may’, trzeba ‘must’).

3 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999855">
Two tagsets can be compared and respective cor-
respondences between their grammatical classes
and categories can be found more easily when
the definitions of those classes and categories are
stated explicitly and formulated in terms of eas-
ily verifiable formal properties of particular word-
forms, such as their inflectional, morphosyntactic
and derivational characteristics, and their phono-
logical or orthographic makeup.
We presented a tagset for Polish constructed
with such criteria in mind. In particular, gram-
matical classes are understood as classes of flex-
emes, i.e., they are defined on the basis of, first
of all, inflectional and, secondly, morphosyntac-
tic properties of wordforms. Further distinctions,
such as those between non-inflecting forms of ver-
bal lexemes, are also made with the avoidance of
any recourse to the semantic or pragmatic prop-
erties of such forms. This allowed us to evade
the controversial issues of the exact extent of such
semantically-defined traditional POSs as numeral
and pronoun.
Despite the evasion of semantic criteria, the re-
sulting set of grammatical classes bears surpris-
ing affinity to traditional POSs, with classes such
as noun and adjective corresponding directly to
traditional POSs, and other classes, such as non-
past verb, l-participle or gerund being proper
subclasses of such traditional POSs as verb. Be-
cause of this fine-grainedness of the current tagset
we were able to evade the controversial issues of
whether to classify gerunds as nouns or as verbs,
and whether to classify adjectival participles as
adjectives or as verbs.

On the other hand, adjectives are welldefined morphosyntactically, as the forms inflecting for gender, number and case, but not, say, person or voice. Now, according to these definitions, it is not clear, whether so-called possessive pronouns, such as mdj ‘my’ should be classified as pronouns or adjectives: semantically they belong to the former class, while morphosyntactically — to the latter. (Traditionally, it is classified as a pronoun, of course.) Another, and perhaps more serious example concerns so-called -nie/-cie gerunds, i.e., substantiva verbalia (Puzynina, 1969) such as pi´c::picie ‘to drink::drinking’, browsowa´c::browsowanie ‘to browse::browsing’.5 These are nominal forms in the sense that they have gender (always n2) and inflect for case and, potentially, for number, but they are also productively related to verbs, have the category of aspect and inflect for negation. As such, they do not comfortably fit into the traditional class noun, whose members do not have aspect or negation, nor do they belong to the class verb, whose members have no case. A similar difficulty is encountered also in case of adjectival participles, which — apart from the adj</context>

As such, they do not comfortably fit into the traditional class noun, whose members do not have aspect or negation, nor do they belong to the class verb, whose members have no case. A similar difficulty is encountered also in case of adjectival participles, which — apart from the adjectival inflectional categories of gender, number and case — also inflect for negation and have aspect. For this reason, and following the general approach of (Saloni, 1974) and (Bie´n, 1991), we propose to derive the notion of grammatical class from the notion of flexeme introduced by Bie´n, where flexeme is understood as a morphosyntactically homogeneous set of forms belonging to the same lexeme. For example, a typical Polish verbal lexeme contains a number of personal forms, a number of impersonal forms, as well as, depending on a particular understanding of the notion of lexeme, various deverbal forms, such as participles and gerunds. These forms have very different morphosyntactic properties: finite non-past tense forms have the inflectional categories of pe</context>

It may seem surprising, at first, to see 9 gender values in an Indo-European language (as opposed to, say, a Bantu language), but this position is well argued for by (Saloni, 1976), who distinguishes those genders on the basis of agreement with adjectives and numerals;4 we will not attempt to further justify this position here. Negation is a category of various de-verbal classes, e.g., participles. Since we assume that the words pisz ˛acy ‘writing’ and niepisz ˛acy ‘not writing’ have the same lemma pisa´c ’to write’, these words have to be distinguished with this morphological category. The category of accentability is used to differentiate accented forms of nominal pronouns (e.g. jego, mnie) from weak forms (go, mi). It roughly corresponds to the category of clitic use</context>
