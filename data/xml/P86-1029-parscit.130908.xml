In this paper, I describe how Donne!Ian&apos;s distinction between
referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions should
be represented in a computational model of reference. After
briefly discussing the significance of DonneIlan&apos;s distinction, I
reinterpret it as being three-tiered, relating to object represen-
tation, referring intentions, and choice of referring expression.
I then present a cognitive model of referring, the components
of which correspond to this analysis, and discuss the interac-
tion that takes place among those components. Finally, the
implementation of this model, now in progress, is described.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777767857143">
It is widely acknowledged that DonneIlan&apos;s distinction [7] be-
tween referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions
must be taken into account in any theory of reference. There
is not yet agreement, however, as to where the distinction fits
in a theoretical model of definite noun phrases. For Cohen
[4], the intention that the hearer identify a referent consti-
tutes a crucial difference between the referential and the at-
tributive. Barwise and Perry [3], on the other hand, treat
their value-loaded/value-free distinction as the central feature
of the referential versus the attributive. However, as pointed
out by Grosz et al. [9], this analysis ignores an essential aspect
of DonneIlan&apos;s distinction, namely, the speaker&apos;s ability, when
using a description referentially, to refer to an object that is
independent of the semantic denotation.
The problem of determining the correct interpretation of
DonneIlan&apos;s distinction is of considerable importance. First,
DonneIlan&apos;s distinction seems to violate the principle that ref-
erence to physical objects is achieved by virtue of the descrip-
tive content of referring expressions. This principle can be
found practically everywhere — for example, in Frege&apos;s sense
and reference, Rusell&apos;s theory of descriptions, and Searle&apos;s
speech acts. In the referential use of definite descriptions,
however, reference seems to be established independently of
descriptive content. If I say &amp;quot;The man over there with a glass
of white wine is...,&amp;quot; I may be successful in my act of referring
— regardless of whether the person over there is a man or a
woman, the glass is full of wine or grape juice, the color of
the beverage is white or red, and so on. This, if accepted,
has far-reaching consequences for the meaning of referring ex-
pressions, for the logical structure of propositions, and for the
theory of propositional attitudes.
Second, the referential/attributive distinction forces us to
reconsider the division between semantics and pragmatics. It
seems that a speaker&apos;s intentions in using a referring expression
do make a semantic difference. If I say &amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer is
insane,&amp;quot; meaning that whoever murdered Smith is insane (the
attributive case), what I say is true if and only if the one and
only murderer is insane. If, on the other hand, my intention is
to use the definite description referentially (referring to, say,
Tom, who is accused of being the culprit), what I say is true
if and only if Tom is indeed insane — whether he is the mur-
derer or not. Unless we understand the interaction between
conventional meaning and a speaker&apos;s intentions in such cases,
we cannot hope to construct an adequate model of referring
and language use in general.
Finally, DonneIlan&apos;s distinction brings to the fore the role
of identification in the speech act of referring. Both Strawson
and Searle ([17,16]) attempted to analyze referring in terms
of identification and identifying descriptions. But Donnellan
has pointed to what seems to be a clear distinction between
cases in which identification is required (referential use) and
those in which it is not (attributive use). This calls for a new
analysis of the speech act of referring, one that does not rely
on identification as a central concept.&apos;
In this paper, I present a general framework for treating
Donnellan&apos;s distinction. In particular, I contend the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.838309">
1. The apparent simplicity of the referential/attributive dis-
tinction masks three aspects of the problem of reference.
In a sense, it is not one distinction but three: the first
has to do with representations of objects, the second —
with referring intentions, the third — with the choice of
referring expressions.
2. These three distinctions are independent of one another,
and should be handled separately. Each is relevant to a
different component of a plan-based model of reference:
the data base, the planner, and the utterance generator,
respectively.
3. Although the three distinctions are mutually independent,

whatever the 0 may be, versus using &amp;quot;the (0” to refer to
an object x, whether or not x is indeed the 0 (the speech

THREE COMPONENTS

<bodyText confidence="0.999857333333333">
they of course interact with one another. The notion of a
conversationally relevant description provides a basis for
explaining how the interaction operates.
In the following sections, the three aspects are presented,
their interactions discussed, and an initial attempt to achieve
an implementation that takes them into account is described.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.70969" genericHeader="method">
CRITERIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966475">
How is the referential to be distinguished from the attributive?
Two criteria are usually offered:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9554458">
1. Even though, when used attributively, the description
must denote the intended referent, in the referential use
this is not necessary.
2. In the referential use, the speaker has a particular object
in mind, whereas in the attributive he does not.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999679971428571">
These criteria have been taken to be equivalent: any use
of a definite description that is referential according to one
criterion should also be classified as referential according to
the other (and similarly for the attributive use). However,
the equivalence of the two criteria is really an illusion: some
uses of definite descriptions are referential according to one
criterion, but attributive according to the other. For example,
let us suppose that John, a police investigator, finds Smith&apos;s
murdered body, and that there are clear fingerprints on the
murder weapon. Now consider John&apos;s utterance: &amp;quot;The man
whose fingerprints these are, whoever he is, is insane.&amp;quot; Note
that John intended to speak of Smith&apos;s murderer, and he may
very well have been successful in conveying his intended ref-
erent, whether or not the fingerprints indeed belonged to the
murderer. Hence, according to the first criterion, the descrip-
tion, &amp;quot;The man whose fingerprints these are,&amp;quot; was used refer-
entially. On the other hand, John did not have any particular
person in mind. Hence, according to the second criterion, the
description must have been used attributively.
Many, including Donnellan, regard the second criterion as
the more significant one. But even this criterion is given two
conflicting interpretations. On the one hand, &amp;quot;having a par-
ticular object in mind&amp;quot; is taken as an epistemic concept: this
view holds that one can have a particular object in mind while
referring only if one knows who or what the referent is. On the
other hand, the criterion also receives what I call the modal
interpretation. According to this reading, the referential use of
a definite description is simply tantamount to employing the
description as a rigid designator. Obviously, the two interpre-
tations are not equivalent. As Kaplan demonstrates (111, one
can use a description as a rigid designator without having any
idea who the referent is.
Thus, there are three aspects of DonneIlan&apos;s distinction that
should be carefully separated. These aspects can be repre-
sented in terms of three dichotomies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.89502675">
• Having knowledge of an object versus not having such
knowledge (the epistemic distinction).
• Using a description as a rigid designator versus using it
as a nonrigid one (the modal distinction).
The epistemic, modal, and speech act distinctions correspond
to three components that a plan-based model of reference must
possess.2 Any such model must contain the following:
1. A database that includes representations of objects
2. A planner that constructs strategies for carrying out re-
ferring intentions
3. An utterance generator that produces referring expres-
sions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994683333333333">
Let us call these the database, the planner, and the utterance-
generator, respectively. The next three sections describe a cog-
nitive model of referring that incorporates these components.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976842">
Object Representations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999667617647059">
Objects are represented to agents by terms. These terms are
grouped into individuating sets. An individuating set for an
agent S is a maximal set of terms, all believed by S to be
denoting the same object. For example, for John, the police
investigator, the set (Smith&apos;s murderer, the man whose finger-
prints these are) is an individuating set of Smith&apos;s murderer.
The incredibly complex cluster of internal representations un-
der which, for instance, John&apos;s mother would be represented
to him is also an individuating set, although it would be im-
practical to enumerate all the terms in this set.
An individuating set is grounded if it contains either a per-
ceptual term or a term that is the value of a function whose
argument is a perceptual term. For example, a set containing
the description &amp;quot;your father&amp;quot; is grounded, since it contains a
terms that is the result of applying the function FATHER-OF
to a perceptual term representing you.
It should be emphasized that an individuating set is the
result of the speaker&apos;s beliefs, not a mirror of what is actually
the case. A speaker may possess two distinct individuating sets
that, unbeknownst to him, determine the same object (e.g.,
Oedipus&apos;s representations of his mother and his wife). On
the other hand, a speaker may possess an individuating set
containing two or more terms that actually denote different
objects. Moreover, the object that an agent believes to be
denoted by the terms of some individuating set may not exist
in the actual world.
Whether or not an agent can have knowledge of the referent,
or know who or what the referent is (the epistemic distinc-
tion), depends on the nature of the relevant individuating set.
In a computational model, we can place a number of restric-
tions on individuating sets to reflect various epistemological
intuitions. For example, we may require that, for an agent to
be able to manipulate an object, the relevant individuating set
must contain a perceptual term, or that, for an agent to know

Referring Intentions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99936275">
A speaker may have two distinct types of referring intentions.
First, he may select a particular term from the relevant indi-
viduating set, and intend this term to be recognized by the
hearer. Second, the speaker may intend to refer to the ob-
ject determined by an individuating set, without intending any
particular term from the set to be part of the proposition he
wants to express. Consider, for example, the following two
statements:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.3024395">
1 The author of Othello wrote the best play about jealousy.
2 Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944333333333">
In making both statements, a speaker would normally be re-
ferring to Shakespeare. But note the difference in referring
intentions between the two: in the first statement, the speaker
selects a particular aspect of Shakespeare, namely, the fact
that he is the author of Othello, and intends the hearer to
think of Shakespeare in terms of this aspect. In the second
statement, the speaker does not select any particular aspect
of Shakespeare from the relevant individuating set. Indeed,
he may not care at all how the hearer makes the connection
between the name &amp;quot;Shakespeare&amp;quot; and the referent.
The two types of referring intentions yield two distinct types
of propositions. When the speaker does not intend any par-
ticular aspect of the referent to be recognized by the hearer,
the proposition expressed in this way is singular, that is, it
does not contain any individual concept of the referent. Con-
sequently, the referring expression chosen by the speaker (be
it a proper name, a demonstrative, or even a definite descrip-
tion) is used as a rigid designator, which means that it picks
out the same individual in all possible worlds where the ref-
erent exists. On the other hand, if a particular aspect of the
referent is meant to be recognized by the hearer, then the in-
dividual concept corresponding to that aspect is part of the
proposition expressed and should therefore be taken into ac-
count in evaluating the truth value of what is said. Thus, it
is the speaker&apos;s referring intentions that determine whether or
not he will use a definite description as a rigid designator (the
modal distinction). Since referring intentions are represented
in the planner, this is where the modal distinction belongs.
Note that the two types of referring intentions can be de-
scribed as intentions to place constraints on the way the hearer
will be thinking of the referent. In Appelt and Kronfeld [21,
this is generalized to other referring intentions — for example,
the intention that the hearer identify the referent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.691835">
Referring Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999625625">
Once the speaker decides what his referring intentions are,
he must choose an appropriate referring expression. Usually,
if a particular aspect of the referent is important, a suitable
definite description is employed; otherwise a proper name or
a demonstrative may be more useful. However, such a neat
correlation between types of referring expressions and referring
intentions may not happen in practice. In any case, as we
shall see in the next section, the speaker&apos;s choice of a referring
expression constitutes an implicit decision as to whether the
denotation of the referring expression must coincide with the
intended referent (the speech act distinction). The choice of
referring expression is naturally made within the utterance
generator, where the speech act distinction is represented.
By way of summary, Table 1 shows how Donnellan&apos;s distinc-
tion, in its reinterpreted form, is related to a plan-based model
of reference.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998938" genericHeader="method">
RELEVANT DESCRIPTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999688086956522">
Kripke and Searle [12,151 explain the referential use as a case
in which speaker&apos;s reference is distinct from semantic refer-
ence. This leaves an important question unanswered: why
must speaker&apos;s reference and semantic reference coincide in
the attributive use?3
Sometimes two definite descriptions are equally useful for
identifying the intended referent, yet cannot be substituted
for each other in a speech act. The description employed, be-
sides being useful for identification, has to be relevant in some
other respect. Consider the utterance: &amp;quot;New York needs more
policemen.&apos; Instead of &amp;quot;New York,&amp;quot; one might have used &apos;The
largest city in the U.S.&apos; or &amp;quot;The Big Apple,&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;The city
hosting the 1986 ACL conference needs more policemen&apos; won&apos;t
do, even though this description might be as useful in identi-
fying New York as the others. The latter statement simply
conveys an unwarranted implication.
As a generalization, we may say that there are two senses
in which a definite description might be regarded as relevant.
First, it has to be relevant for the purpose of letting the hearer
know what the speaker is talking about.4 A description that
is relevant in this sense may be called functionally relevant.
Stcond, as the example above indicates, a description might
exhibit a type of relevance that is not merely a referring tool.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.995165666666667">
3As redefined by the speech act distinction.
4Whether the hearer is also expected to identify the referent is a sepa-
rate issue.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.997202">
188
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997867">
A description that is relevant in this noninstrumental sense
might be called conversationally relevant.
Every use of a definite description for the purpose of refer-
ence has to be functionally relevant. But not every such use
has to be conversationally relevant. If indicating the referent
is the only intended purpose, any other functionally relevant
description will do just as well.
In other cases, the description is supposed to do more than
just point out the intended referent to the hearer. Consider
the following examples:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.445824666666667">
3 This happy man must have been drinking champagne.
4 The man who murdered Smith so brutally has to be insane.
5 The winner of this race will get $10,000.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999274428571429">
In these examples, the speaker implicates (in Grice&apos;s sense)
something that is not part of what he says. In (3), it is impli-
cated that the man&apos;s happiness is due to his drinking. In (4), it
is implicated that the main motivation for believing the mur-
derer to be insane is that he committed such a brutal homicide.
The implicature in (5) is that the only reason for giving the
winner $10,000 is his victory in a particular race. In all these
cases, what is implicated is some relationship between a spe-
cific characteristic of the referent mentioned in the description
and whatever is said about that referent. In such cases, it does
matter what description is chosen, since the relevance is both
functional and conversational. No other description, even if it
identifies equally well, can be as successful in conveying the
intended implicature.
The conversationally relevant description may not be men-
tioned explicitly, but rather inferred indirectly from the con-
text. In the fingerprint example, the speaker uses the descrip-
tion, The man whose fingerprints these are, but the conversa-
tionally relevant description is nevertheless Smith&apos;s murderer.
Thus, there are three general ways in which a speaker may
employ a referring definite description:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9286264">
1. If the discourse requires no conversationally relevant de-
scription, any functionally relevant one will do. This cov-
ers all standard examples of the referential use, in which
the sole function of the definite description is to indicate
an object to the hearer.
2. If a conversationally relevant description is needed, the
speaker may do either of the following:
(a) Use the description explicitly. This is what is done
in standard examples of the attributive use.
(b) Use a different, functionally relevant description.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994100066666667">
The speaker can do so, however, only if the context
indicates the aspect of the referent that corresponds
to the conversationally relevant description. This ex-
plains the ambiguity of the fingerprint example. As
the definite description uttered is only functionally
relevant, its use appears to be referential. Yet, un-
like the referential case, a conversationally relevant
description is implied.
In sum, when the description used is conversationally rel-
evant, the speaker intends that the specific way he chose to
do his referring should be taken into account in interpreting
the speech act as a whole. Consequently, if the description
fails, so does the entire speech act. On the other hand, if the
description is only functionally relevant, the context may still
supply enough information to identify the intended referent.

INTERACTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804103448276">
When a speaker plans a speech act involving reference to an
object, he must determine whether or not a conversationally
relevant description is needed. However, the nature of the in-
dividuating set, on the one hand, and constraints on choices of
referring expressions, on the other, may influence the speaker&apos;s
planning in various ways. For example, if the individuating set
contains only one item, say, the shortest spy, the definite de-
scription &amp;quot;the shortest spy&amp;quot; must be conversationally relevant.
This is true both on formal and pragmatic grounds. From
a formal standpoint, the description is conversationally rele-
vant by default: no other functionally relevant description can
be substituted because no such description is available. From
a pragmatic standpoint, the description &amp;quot;the shortest spy&amp;quot; is
very likely to be conversationally relevant in real discourse,
simply because all we know about the referent is that he is the
shortest spy. Thus, whatever we may have to say about that
person is very likely to be related to the few facts contained in
the description.
Even if it is clear that a conversationally relevant description
is needed for the speech act to succeed, constraints on choices
of referring expressions may prevent the speaker from using
this description. One such constraint results from the need
to identify the referent for the hearer. If the conversationally
relevant description is not suited for identification, a conflict
arises. For example, in &amp;quot;John believes Smith&apos;s murderer to be
insane,&amp;quot; the speaker may be trying simultaneously to represent
the content of John&apos;s belief and to identify for the hearer whom
the belief is about. Sometimes it is impossible to accomplish
both goals with one and the same description.

IMPLEMENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976">
This paper is part of an extensive analysis of the referen-
tial/attributive distinction, which I use in the construction of a
general model of reference 114 My ultimate research objective
is to provide a computational version of the reference model,
then to incorporate it into a general plan-based account of def-
inite and indefinite noun phrases. An experimental program
that implements individuating sets has already been written.
Called BERTRAND, this program interprets a small subset of
English statements, and stores the information in its database,
which it then uses to answer questions. Individuating sets are
represented by an equivalence relation that holds among refer-
ring expressions: two referring expressions, R1 and R2 belong
to the same individuating set if, according to the information
interpreted SO far, R1 and R2 denote the same object. In con-
structing individuating sets, BERTRAND uses a combination
of logical and pragmatic strategies. The logical strategy ex-
ploits the fact that the relation &amp;quot;denote the same object&amp;quot; is
symmetric, transitive, and closed under substitution. Thus, it
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996819">
189
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998506666666667">
can be concluded that two referring expressions, R1 and R2 ,
denote the same object (belong to the same individuating set)
in one of the following ways:5
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988645166666667">
1. Directly, when the statement &amp;quot;R1 is R2&amp;quot; (or uR2 is RI&amp;quot;)
has been asserted.
2. Recursively using transitivity — i.e., when, for a referring
expression R3, it can be shown that R1 and R3, as well as
Rs and R2, belong to the same individuating set.
3. Recursively using substitution — i.e., when R1 and R2 are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985514704545455">
identical, except that R1 contains a referring expression
subRi exactly where R2 contains a referring expression
subR2, and subRi and subR2 belong to the same individ-
uating set.
Note that, in the logical strategy, it is tacitly assumed that
the relation of denoting the same object always holds between
two identical tokens of referring expressions. This is obviously
too strong an assumption for any realistic discourse: for ex-
ample, two utterances of &amp;quot;The man&apos; may very well denote two
different people. On the other hand, the logical strategy fails
to capture cases in which it is implied (although never actu-
ally asserted) that two distinct referring expressions denote the
same thing. For example, &amp;quot;I met Marvin Maxwell yesterday.
The man is utterly insane!&amp;quot;
To compensate for these weaknesses, BERTRAND uses a
strategy based on Grosz&apos;s notion of &amp;quot;focus stack&amp;quot; [8,10]. In
conceptual terms (and without going into details), it works as
follows: a stack of individuating sets, representing objects that
are &amp;quot;in focus,&amp;quot; is maintained throughout the &amp;quot;conversation.&apos;
When a new referring expression is interpreted, it is trans-
formed into an open sentence D(x) with a single free variable
z.6 An individuating set I is said to subsume an open sentence
S if S can be derived from I. The first individuating set in the
focus stack to subsume D(x) represents the object denoted by
the new referring expression. This solves the aforementioned
problems: two occurrences of the same referring expression
are considered as denoting the same object only if both are
subsumed by the same individuating set in the focus stack,
and two distinct referring expressions may still be considered
as denoting the same object even though the logical strategy
failed to show this, provided that both are subsumed by the
same individuating set.
Once the concept of an individuating set has been imple-
mented, referring intentions can be represented as intentions
to activate appropriate subsets of individuating sets. For ex-
ample, the intention to use a conversationally relevant descrip-
tion can be represented as the plan to activate a subset of an
individuating set that contains the term associated with the
description. This is the topic of a current joint research effort
with D. Appelt [2] to investigate the interaction that takes
place between individuating sets and Appelt&apos;s four types of
&amp;What belongs to an individuating set, of course, is not a referring
expression but the logical structure associated with it. For the sake of
simplicity, however, I do not make this distinction here.

After briefly discussing the significance of DonneIlan&apos;s distinction, I reinterpret it as being three-tiered, relating to object representation, referring intentions, and choice of referring expression. I then present a cognitive model of referring, the components of which correspond to this analysis, and discuss the interaction that takes place among those components.

Once the concept of an individuating set has been implemented, referring intentions can be represented as intentions to activate appropriate subsets of individuating sets.

Finally, the implementation of this model, now in progress, is described. INTRODUCTION It is widely acknowledged that DonneIlan&apos;s distinction [7] between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions must be taken into account in any theory of reference. There is not yet agreement, however, as to where the distinction fits in a theoretical model of definite noun phrases. For Cohen [4], the intention that the hearer identify a referent constitutes a crucial difference between the referential and the attributive. Barwise and Perry [3], on the other hand, treat their value-loaded/value-free distinction as the central feature of the referential versus the attributive. However, as pointed out by Grosz et al. [9], this analysis ignores an essential aspect of DonneIlan&apos;s distinction, namely, the speaker&apos;s ability, when using a description referentially, to refer to an object that is independent of the semantic denotation. The problem of determining the correct interpretation of D</context>
