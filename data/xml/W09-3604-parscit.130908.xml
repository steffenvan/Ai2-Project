Classification of research papers into patent clas-
sification systems makes it possible to conduct
an exhaustive and effective prior art search, inva-
lidity search, and technical trend analysis. How-
ever, it would be too costly and time-consuming
to have the research paper&apos;s authors or another
professional classify such documents manually.
Therefore, we have investigated the classification
o f research papers into a patent classification
system.
In previous studies, classification o f patents
was conducted as subtasks in the 5th and 6th
NTCIR workshops (Iwayama et al., 2005;
Iwayama et al., 2007). In these subtasks, partici-
pants were asked to classify Japanese patents
using the File Forming Term (F-term) system,
which is a classification system for Japanese pa-
tents. Here, we have focused on the classification
o f research papers, and we need to take into ac-
count the differences in terms used in research
papers and patents because the terms used in pa-
tents are often more abstract or creative than
those used in research papers in order to widen
the scope of the claims. For example, the scho-
larly term &amp;quot;machine translation&amp;quot; can be ex-
pressed as &amp;quot;automatic translation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;language
conversion&amp;quot; in patent documents. In addition to
taking the differences o f genres into account, it is
necessary to do exhaustive searches and analyses
focusing on the classification o f research papers
written in various languages.
To solve these problems, we propose some
classification methods using two machine trans-
lation models. When translating English research
papers into Japanese, the performance o f a trans-
lation model for patents is generally inferior to
that for research papers, because the terms used

Classifying research papers into patent classi-
fication systems enables an exhaustive and ef-
fective invalidity search, prior art search, and
technical trend analysis. However, it is very
costly to classify research papers manually.
Therefore, we have studied automatic classifi-
cation o f research papers into a patent classifi-
cation system. To classify research papers into
patent classification systems, the differences in
terms used in research papers and patents
should be taken into account. This is because
the terms used in patents are often more ab-
stract or creative than those used in research
papers in order to widen the scope o f the
claims. It is also necessary to do exhaustive
searches and analyses that focus on classifica-
tion o f research papers written in various lan-
guages. To solve these problems, we propose
some classification methods using two ma-
chine translation models. When translating
English research papers into Japanese, the per-
formance o f a translation model for patents is
inferior to that for research papers due to the
differences in terms used in research papers
and patents. However, the model for patents is
thought to be useful for our task because trans-
lation results by patent translation models tend
to contain more patent terms than those for re-
search papers. To confirm the effectiveness o f
our methods, we conducted some experiments
using the data o f the Patent Mining Task in the
NTCIR-7 Workshop. From the experimental
results, we found that our method using trans-
lation models for both research papers and pa-
tents was more effective than using a single
translation model.

in patents are different from those in research
papers. However, we thought that a translation
model for patents might be useful for our task,
because translation results using the patent trans-
lation model tend to contain more patent terms
than those obtained using the model for research

<bodyText confidence="0.996110164179105">
In this section, we describe some related studies
on &amp;quot;cross-genre information access&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cross-
lingual information access&amp;quot;.
Cross-genre Information Access
Much research has been done in the field o f
cross-genre information retrieval and document
classification. The technical survey task in the
NTCIR-3 workshop (Iwayama et al., 2002) is an
example. This task aimed to retrieve patents re-
levant to a given newspaper article. In this task,
Itoh et al. (2002) focused on &amp;quot;Term Distillation&amp;quot;.
The distribution o f the frequency o f the occur-
rence o f words was known to be different be-
tween newspaper articles and patents. For exam-
ple, the word &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; often appears in news-
paper articles, while this word seldom appears in
patents. As a result, unimportant words such as
&amp;quot;president&amp;quot; were assigned high scores in patents
when using tf*idf to weight words. Term Distil-
lation is a technique that can prevent such cases
by filtering out words that can be assigned incor-
rect weights. This idea was also used to link
news articles and blog entries (Ikeda et al., 2006).
Another approach for cross-genre information
retrieval was that used by Nanba et al. (2008:a),
who proposed a method to integrate a research
paper database and a patent database by analyz-
ing citation relations between research papers
and patents. For the integration, they extracted
bibliographic information o f cited literature in
&amp;quot;prior art&amp;quot; fields in Japanese patent applications.
Using this integrated database, users can retrieve
patents that relate to a particular research paper
by tracing citation relations between research
papers and patents. However, the number o f
cited papers among patent applications is not
sufficient to retrieve related papers or patents,
even though the number o f opportunities for cit-
ing papers in patents or for citing patents in pa-
pers has been increasing recently.
As another approach for cross-genre informa-
tion retrieval, Nanba et al. (2009) proposed a
method to paraphrase scholarly terms into patent
terms (e.g., paraphrasing &amp;quot;floppy disc&amp;quot; into
&amp;quot;magnetic recording medium&amp;quot;). They focused on
citation relationships between research papers
and patents for the paraphrased terms. Generally,
a research paper and a patent that have a citation
relationship tend to be in the same research field.
Therefore, they paraphrased a scholarly term into
a patent term in two steps: (1) retrieve research
papers that contain a given scholarly term in their
titles, and (2) extract patent terms from patents
that have citation relations with the retrieved pa-
pers.
The NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task (Nanba et
al., 2008:b) is another example o f research done
on information access using research papers and
patents. The aim o f the Patent Mining Task was
to classify research papers written in either Japa-
nese or English using the International Patent
Classification (IPC) system, which is a global
standard hierarchical patent classification system.
The following four subtasks were included in
this task, and 12 groups participated in three o f
them: Japanese, English, and Cross-lingual (J2E)
subtasks.
</bodyText>

ta written in English.
• Cross-lingual subtask (E2J): classification

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997805">
Because the number of categories (IPC codes)
that research papers were classified into was very
large (30,855), only two participating groups
employed machine learning, which is the most
standard approach in the NLP field. The other
groups used the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) me-
thod. Among all participant groups, only Mase
and Iwayama&apos;s group (2008) coped with the
problem o f the differences in terms between re-

search papers and patents. Mase and Iwayama
used a pseudo-relevance feedback method to col-
lect related patent terms for a given research pa-
per. First, they retrieved patents relevant to a
given research paper. Next, they extracted patent
terms from the top n retrieved patents. Then they
retrieved patents again using the patent terms
extracted in the second step. Finally, they classi-
fied research papers using the k-NN method.
However, they reported that a simple k-NN
based method was superior to the method based
on the pseudo-relevance feedback method. In
this paper, we also examined our methods using
the data o f the NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task.
TREC Chemistry Track 1 is another related
study involving research papers and patents. This
track aims for cross-genre information retrieval
using research papers and patents in the chemical
field. This track started in 2009 under the Text
Retrieval Conference (TREC), and the details
including experimental results will be reported at
the final meeting to be held in November 2009.
Cross-lingual Information Access
Much research has been done on cross-lingual
information access using research papers and
patents. In the NTCIR workshop, cross-lingual
information retrieval tasks have been carried out
using research papers (Kando et al., 1999; Kando
et al., 2001) and patents (Fujii et al., 2004; Fujii
et al., 2005; Fujii et al., 2007). In the CLEF
evaluation workshop, the cross-lingual patent
retrieval task &amp;quot;CLEF-IP&amp;quot; was initiated in 20092.
The cross-lingual subtask in the NTCIR-7 Patent
Mining Task (Nanba et al., 2008:b) is another
cross-lingual information access study.
Here, we describe two methods used in the
cross-lingual subtask (J2E) in the Patent Mining
Task (Bian and Teng, 2008, Clinchant and Rend-
ers, 2008). Bian and Teng (2008) translated Jap-
anese research papers into English using three
online translation systems (Google, Excite, and
Yahoo! Babel Fish), and classified them using a
k-NN-based text classifier. Clinchant and Rend-
ers (2008) automatically obtained a Japanese-
English bilingual dictionary from approximately
300,000 pairs o f titles from Japanese and English
research papers (Kando et al., 1999) using Giza3,
a statistical machine translation toolkit. Then

<bodyText confidence="0.999764933333333">
they classified papers using this dictionary and a
k-NN-based document classifier. Bian and Clin-
chant also participated in an English subtask and
obtained almost the same mean average precision
(MAP) scores as those o f the J2E subtask.
Although the direction o f translation of our
system is different from Bian and Clinchant, we
also tried our methods using the data o f the
cross-lingual subtask (E2J). We utilized the Giza
toolkit in the same way as Clinchant, but our ap-
proach was different from Clinchant, because we
solved the problem o f &amp;quot;differences o f terms used
in research papers and patents&amp;quot; by using two
translation models obtained from both research
papers and patents parallel corpora.

We explain here the procedure o f our cross-genre,
cross-lingual document classification method
depicted in Figure 1. The goal o f our task is to
classify document I written in language L1 in
genre G1 into a classification system (categories)
using documents written in language L2 in genre
G2, and classification codes were manually an-
notated to each o f these documents. Generally,
three steps are required for cross-genre, cross-
lingual document classification: (1) translate
document I into Language L2 using a translation
model for genre G1 (document O in Figure 1),
(2) paraphrase terms in document O into terms in
genre G2 (document O&apos;), and (3) classify O&apos; into
a classification system. Here, if a translation
model for genre G2 is available, steps (1) and (2)
can be resolved using this translation model, be-
cause terms in the translation results using the
model are more appropriate in genre G2. How-
ever, as it is assumed that the translation model
translates documents in genre G2, the translation
results might contain more mistranslations than
the results obtained by a model for genre G1. We
therefore combine translation results (O+O&apos;)
produced by translation models for genre G1 and
for G2. These results can be expected to contain
terms in genre G2 and to minimize the effects o f
mistranslation by using the translation model for
genre G1.

Abstract: Barrier ribs in the color PDP have
usually been fabricated by multiple screen print-
ing. However, the precise rib printing o f fine pat-
terns for the high resolution display panel is dif-
ficult to make well in proportion as the panel size
grow larger. On the other hand, luminance and
luminous efficiency o f reflective phosphor
screen will be expected to increase when the
phosphor is deposited on the inner wall of dis-
play cells. Sandblasting technique has been ap-
plied to make barrier ribs for the high resolution
PDP and nonffat phosphor screens on the inner
wall o f display cells.

We used two phrase tables for research papers
and patents when translating English index terms
into Japanese. For a given English term, we se-
lected the Japanese term with the highest transla-
tion probability from the candidates in each table.
These tables were automatically obtained in the
process of constructing translation models for
research papers and patents using Giza and Mos-
es. However, there are several other ways to
translate index terms, such as using bilingual
dictionaries o f technical terms or compositional
semantics (Tonoike et al., 2007), we employed a
phrase table-based method because the effective-
ness o f this method was experimentally con-
firmed by Itakagi et al. (2007). In addition to this
method, we also investigated using bilingual dic-
tionaries of technical terms as baseline methods.
Details o f these methods are in Section 4.2.
Document Classification Module
We used Nanba&apos;s k-NN-based system (Nanba,
2008:c) for a Japanese subtask as a document
classification module in our system. This module
uses a patent retrieval engine (Nanba, 2007)
which was developed for the NTCIR-6 Patent
Retrieval Task (Fujii et al., 2007). This engine
introduced the Vector Space Model as a retrieval
model, SMART (Salton, 1971) for term weight-
ing, and noun phrases (sequence o f nouns), verbs,
and adjectives for index terms. The classification
module obtained a list of IPC codes using the
following procedure.

Correct data set
We used a data set for the formal run o f the
cross-lingual subtask in the NTCIR-7 Patent
Mining Task (Nanba, et al., 2008). In the data set,
IPC codes were manually assigned to each 879
topics (research papers). For each topic, an aver-
age o f 2.3 IPC codes was manually assigned.
These correct data were compared with a list o f
IPC codes9 by systems, and the systems were
evaluated in terms o f MAP (mean average preci-
sion). Here, the 879 topics were divided into two
groups: group A, in which highly relevant IPC
codes were assigned to 473 topics, and group B,
in which relevant IPC codes were assigned to
406 topics. In our experiment, we evaluated sev-
eral systems in two ways: using group A only
and using both groups.

• Japanese subtask: This is the same as the
Japanese subtask in the NTCIR-7 Patent
Mining Task. For this subtask, Japanese re-
search papers, which are manual (ideal)
translations o f corresponding English papers,
are input into a system.
• Japanese subtask+Index(Patent): Union o f
&amp;quot;Japanese subtask&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;.

Another reason for using the baseline methods is
that the terms used in patents are often more ab-
stract or creative than those used in research pa-
pers, as mentioned in Section 1. Therefore, we
paraphrased index terms in SMT(Paper) by their
hypernyms using a hypernym/hyponym thesau-
rus (Nanba, 2007). Nanba automatically created
this thesaurus consisting o f 1,800,000 terms from
10 years o f unexamined Japanese patent applica-
tions using a set o f patterns, such as &amp;quot;NP0 ya NP1
nadono NP2 (NP2 such as NP0 and NP1)&amp;quot; (Hearst,
1992).

Experimental results are given in Table 2. From
the results, we can see that &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot; ob-
tained the highest MAP scores when using topics
in group A+B and in group A. O f the 10 methods

method &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; obtained

Difference of terms between research and pa-
tents (Comparison of &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;)
Although the quality o f phrase tables for research
papers (&amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot;) and patents (&amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot;) was not very different, the MAP
score o f &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; was 0.01 better than that
o f &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;. To investigate this gap, we
compared Japanese indices by &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;. There were 69,100 English
index terms in total, and 47,055 terms
(47,055/69,100=0.681) were translated by the
model for research papers, while 40,427 terms
(40,427/69,100=0.585) were translated by the
model for patents. Ten percent of this gap indi-
cates that terms used in research papers and in
patents are different, which causes the gap in
MAP scores o f &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Paper)&amp;quot;.

Combination of &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot;
When a term translated by the model for research
papers matches a term translated by the model
for patents, they seem to be a correct translation.
Therefore, we examined &amp;quot;In-
dex(Paper)*Index(Patent)&amp;quot;. The method uses
terms as an index when translation results by
both models match. From the experimental re-
sults, this method obtained 0.1830 and 0.2230 o f
MAP scores when using topics in group A+B
and in group A, respectively. These results indi-
cate that the overlap o f lexicons between re-
search papers and patents is relatively large, and
terms in this overlap are effective for our task.
However, the MAP score o f &amp;quot;In-
dex(Paper)*Index(Patent)&amp;quot; was 0.02 lower than
&amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;, which indi-
cates that there are not enough terms in the over-
lap for our task.
In addition to &amp;quot;Index(Paper)*Index(Patent)&amp;quot;,
we also examined &amp;quot;Index(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot;,
which is a union o f &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot;. From the experimental results, we
obtained respective MAP scores o f 0.2258 and
0.2596 when using topics in group A+B and in
group A. These scores are 0.01 to 0.02 higher
than the scores of &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot;. These encouraging results indicate
that our method using two translation models is
effective for a cross-genre document classifica-
tion task.

+Index(Patent)&amp;quot;
In addition to &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;
also obtained high MAP scores. Therefore, we
combined &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;
instead o f &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot;. From the experimental
results, we found that this approach
(&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot;) produced MAP
scores o f 0.2633 when using topics in group
A+B and 0.2807 when using topics in group A.
These scores were the highest o f all, almost ap-
proaching the results o f upper-bound methods.
Comparison of &amp;quot;Index(TechDic)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In-
dex(EIJIRO)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot;
Both &amp;quot;Index(TechDic)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Index(EIJIRO)&amp;quot;
were worse than &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In-
dex(Patent)&amp;quot; by more than 0.05 in the MAP
scores. These results were due to the lower num-
ber of terms translated by each method. Because
phrase tables for research papers and patents
were automatically created, they were not as cor-
rect as &amp;quot;TechDic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;EIJIRO&amp;quot;. However, the
phrase tables were able to translate more English
terms into Japanese in comparison with &amp;quot;Tech-
Dic&amp;quot; (30,008/69,100=0.434) and &amp;quot;EIJIRO&amp;quot;
(37607/69,100=0.544), and these induced the
difference o f MAP scores.
Comparison of &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Hypernym&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Hypernym&amp;quot; impaired
&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;, because the method paraphrased
unnecessary terms into their hypernyms. As a
result, irrelevant patents were contained within
the top 170 search results, and the k-NN method
ranked irrelevant IPC codes at higher levels. Our
methods using two translation models are differ-
ent from &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Hypernym&amp;quot; in this point
because two translation models translate into the
same term when a scholarly term need not be
paraphrased.
Classification of Japanese research papers
using &amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;
As we mentioned above, the &amp;quot;In-
dex(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; models improved
the MAP scores o f both &amp;quot;Index(Paper)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;. We further investigated whether
&amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot; could also improve monolingual
document classification (&amp;quot;Japanese sub-
task+Index(Patent)&amp;quot;). In this method, a Japanese
index was created from a manually written Japa-
nese research paper, and this was combined with
&amp;quot;Index(Patent)&amp;quot;. The results showed that &amp;quot;Japa-
nese subtask+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; could slightly im-
prove MAP scores when using topics in group
A+B and in group A.
Practicality of our method
Recall values for the top n results by
&amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot;, which obtained
the highest MAP score, are in Table 3. In this
table, the results using all topics (group A+B)
and the topics in group A are shown. The results
indicate that almost 40% of the IPC codes were
found within top 10 results, and 70% were found
within the top 100. For practical use, we need to
improve recall at the top 1, but we still believe
that these results are useful for supporting begin-
ners in patent searches. It is often necessary for
searchers to use patent classification codes for
effective patent retrieval, but professional skill
and much experience are required to select rele-
vant IPC codes. In such cases, our method is use-
ful to look for relevant IPC codes.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999730076923077">
We proposed several methods that automatically
classify research papers into the IPC system us-
ing two translation models. To confirm the effec-
tiveness o f our method, we conducted some ex-
aminations using the data o f the NTCIR-7 Patent
Mining Task. The results showed that one o f our
methods &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; obtained
a MAP score of 0.2897. This score was higher
than that of &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot;, which used transla-
tion results by the translation model for research
papers, and this indicates that our method is ef-
fective for cross-genre, cross-lingual document
classification.

From the results, we can see that &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)&amp;quot; obtained the highest MAP scores when using topics in group A+B and in group A. O f the 10 methods used (except for the upper-bound methods), our method &amp;quot;SMT(Paper)+Index(Patent)&amp;quot; obtained the highest MAP score. 4.4 Discussion Difference of terms betwe</context>

For example, the word &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; often appears in newspaper articles, while this word seldom appears in patents. As a result, unimportant words such as &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; were assigned high scores in patents when using tf*idf to weight words. Term Distillation is a technique that can prevent such cases by filtering out words that can be assigned incorrect weights. This idea was also used to link news articles and blog entries (Ikeda et al., 2006). Another approach for cross-genre information retrieval was that used by Nanba et al. (2008:a), who proposed a method to integrate a research paper database and a patent database by analyzing citation relations between research papers and patents. For the integration, they extracted bibliographic information o f cited literature in &amp;quot;prior art&amp;quot; fields in Japanese patent applications. Using this integrated database, users can retrieve patents that relate to a particular research paper by tracing citation relations between research papers and patents.

They focused on citation relationships between research papers and patents for the paraphrased terms. Generally, a research paper and a patent that have a citation relationship tend to be in the same research field. Therefore, they paraphrased a scholarly term into a patent term in two steps: (1) retrieve research papers that contain a given scholarly term in their titles, and (2) extract patent terms from patents that have citation relations with the retrieved papers. The NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task (Nanba et al., 2008:b) is another example o f research done on information access using research papers and patents. The aim o f the Patent Mining Task was to classify research papers written in either Japanese or English using the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, which is a global standard hierarchical patent classification system. The following four subtasks were included in this task, and 12 groups participated in three o f them: Japanese, English, and Cross-lingual (J2E) subtasks. • Japanese subtask: classification o f Japanese research papers using patent data written in Japanese. • English</context>

Cross-lingual Information Access Much research has been done on cross-lingual information access using research papers and patents. In the NTCIR workshop, cross-lingual information retrieval tasks have been carried out using research papers (Kando et al., 1999; Kando et al., 2001) and patents (Fujii et al., 2004; Fujii et al., 2005; Fujii et al., 2007). In the CLEF evaluation workshop, the cross-lingual patent retrieval task &amp;quot;CLEF-IP&amp;quot; was initiated in 20092. The cross-lingual subtask in the NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task (Nanba et al., 2008:b) is another cross-lingual information access study. Here, we describe two methods used in the cross-lingual subtask (J2E) in the Patent Mining Task (Bian and Teng, 2008, Clinchant and Renders, 2008). Bian and Teng (2008) translated Japanese research papers into English using three online translation systems (Google, Excite, and Yahoo!

These correct data were compared with a list o f IPC codes9 by systems, and the systems were evaluated in terms o f MAP (mean average precision). Here, the 879 topics were divided into two groups: group A, in which highly relevant IPC codes were assigned to 473 topics, and group B, in which relevant IPC codes were assigned to 406 topics.

In addition to this method, we also investigated using bilingual dictionaries of technical terms as baseline methods. Details o f these methods are in Section 4.2. Document Classification Module We used Nanba&apos;s k-NN-based system (Nanba, 2008:c) for a Japanese subtask as a document classification module in our system. This module uses a patent retrieval engine (Nanba, 2007) which was developed for the NTCIR-6 Patent Retrieval Task (Fujii et al., 2007). This engine introduced the Vector Space Model as a retrieval model, SMART (Salton, 1971) for term weighting, and noun phrases (sequence o f nouns), verbs, and adjectives for index terms. The classification module obtained a list of IPC codes using the following procedure. 1. Retrieve top 170 results using the patent retrieval engine for a given research paper. 2. Extract IPC codes with relevance scores for the query from each retrieved patent in step 1. 3. Rank IPC codes using the following equation. n Score(X) _ Σ Relevance score o f each patent i_1 Here, X and n indicate the IPC code and the number o f patents that X was assigned to within the top 170 retrieved patents, respect</context>
