<bodyText confidence="0.999884421052632">
In this paper, we present a PropBank of
clinical Finnish, an annotated corpus of
verbal propositions and arguments. The
clinical PropBank is created on top of a
previously existing dependency treebank
annotated in the Stanford Dependency
(SD) scheme and covers 90% of all verb
occurrences in the treebank.
We establish that the PropBank scheme
is applicable to clinical Finnish as well
as compatible with the SD scheme, with
an overwhelming proportion of arguments
being governed by the verb. This allows
argument candidates to be restricted to di-
rect verb dependents, substantially simpli-
fying the PropBank construction.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9998865">
Natural language processing (NLP) in the clini-
cal domain has received substantial interest, with
applications in decision support, patient man-
aging and profiling, mining trends, and others
(see the extensive review by Friedman and John-
son (2006)). While some of these applications,
such as document retrieval and trend mining,
can rely solely on word-frequency-based methods,
others, such as information extraction and summa-
rization require a detailed linguistic analysis cap-
turing some of the sentence semantics. Among the
most important steps in this direction is an analysis
of verbs and their argument structures.
In this work, we focus on the Finnish lan-
guage in the clinical domain, analyzing its verbs
and their argument structures using the PropBank
scheme (Palmer et al., 2005). The choice of this
particular scheme is motivated by its practical,
application-oriented nature. We build the clinical
Finnish PropBank on top of the existing depen-
dency treebank of Haverinen et al. (2009).
The primary outcome of this study is the
PropBank of clinical Finnish itself, consisting of
the analyses for 157 verbs with 2,382 occurrences
and 4,763 arguments, and covering 90% of all
verb occurrences in the underlying treebank. This
PropBank, together with the treebank, is an impor-
tant resource for the further development of clini-
cal NLP applications for the Finnish language.
We also establish the applicability of the
PropBank scheme to the clinical sublanguage with
its many atypical characteristics, and finally, we
find that the PropBank scheme is compatible with
the Stanford Dependency scheme of de Marneffe
and Manning (2008a; 2008b) in which the under-
lying treebank is annotated.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997915">
Our annotation work is based on the PropBank se-
mantic annotation scheme of Palmer et al. (2005).
For each verb, PropBank defines a number of
framesets, each frameset corresponding to a
coarse-grained sense. A frameset consists of a
roleset which defines a set of roles (arguments
numbered from Arg0 onwards) and their descrip-
tions, and a set of syntactic frames. Any element
that occurs together with a given verb sufficiently
frequently is taken to be its argument. Arg0 is gen-
erally a prototypical Agent argument and Arg1 is
a prototypical Patient or Theme argument. The
remaining numbered arguments have no consis-
tent overall meanings: they are defined on a verb-
by-verb basis. An illustration of a verb with two
framesets is given in Figure 1. In addition to the
numbered arguments, a verb occurrence can have
a number of modifiers, labeled ArgM, each modi-
fier being categorized as one of 14 subtypes, such
as temporal, cause and location.

3 Clinical Finnish and the clinical
Finnish treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993588756756757">
This study is based on the clinical Finnish tree-
bank of Haverinen et al. (2009), which consists
of 2,081 sentences with 15,335 tokens and 13,457
dependencies. The text of the treebank comprises
eight complete patient reports from an intensive
care unit in a Finnish hospital. An intensive care
patient report describes the condition of the pa-
tient and its development in time. The clinical
Finnish in these reports has many characteristics
typical of clinical languages, including frequent
misspellings, abbreviations, domain terms, tele-
graphic style and non-standard syntactic structures
(see Figure 2 for an illustration). For a detailed
analysis, we refer the reader to the studies by Laip-
pala et al. (2009) and Haverinen et al. (2009).
The treebank of Haverinen et al. is annotated
in the Stanford Dependency (SD) scheme of de
Marneffe and Manning (2008a; 2008b). This
scheme is layered, and the annotation variant of
the treebank of Haverinen et. al is the basic vari-
ant of the scheme, in which the analysis forms a
tree.
The SD scheme also defines a collapsed de-
pendencies with propagation of conjunct depen-
dencies variant (referred to as the extended vari-
ant of the SD scheme throughout this paper). It
adds on top of the basic variant a second layer
of dependencies which are not part of the strict,
syntactic tree. In particular, the xsubj dependency
marks external subjects, and dependencies involv-
ing the heads of coordinations are explicitly dupli-
Figure 3: The extended SD scheme. The dashed
dependencies denote the external subjects and
propagated conjunct dependencies that are only
part of the extended variant of the scheme. The
example can be translated as Patient [has been]
allowed to have juice and bread.

cated also for the remaining coordinated elements
where appropriate. The extended variant of the SD
scheme is illustrated in Figure 3.
Due to the importance of the additional depen-
dencies for PropBanking (see Section 5 for discus-
sion), we augment the annotation of the underly-
ing treebank to conform to the extended variant of
the SD scheme by manual annotation, adding a to-
tal of 520 dependencies.
The PropBank was originally developed on top
of the constituency scheme of the Penn Tree-
bank and requires arguments to correspond to con-
stituents. In a dependency scheme, where there is
no explicit notion of constituents, we associate ar-
guments of a verb with dependencies governed by
it. The argument can then be understood as the
entire subtree headed by the dependent. The an-
notation is illustrated in Figure 4.

mation, we identify all verbs and verbal participles
using the FinCG1 analyzer, which gives a verbal
reading to 2,816 tokens. With POS tagging er-
rors taken into account, we estimate the treebank
to contain 2,655 occurrences of verbs and verb
participles. Of these, 2,382 (90%) correspond to
verbs with at least three occurrences and are thus
annotated. In total, these verbs have 4,763 argu-
ments and modifiers.
Due to the telegraphic nature of clinical Finnish,
omissions of different sentence elements, even
main verbs, are very frequent. In order to be able
to analyze the syntax of sentences with a missing
main verb, Haverinen et al. have added a so called
null verb to these sentences in the treebank. For
instance, the clinical Finnish sentence Putkesta
nestett¨a (Liquid from the drain) lacks a main verb,
and the insertion of one produces Putkesta *null*
nestett¨a. In total, there are 428 null verb occur-
rences, making the null verb the most common
verb in the treebank.
In the clinical PropBank annotation, we treat the
null verb in principle as if it was a regular verb,
and give it framesets accordingly. For each null
verb occurrence, we have determined which reg-
ular verb frameset it stands for, and found that,
somewhat surprisingly, there were only four com-
mon coarse senses of the null verb, roughly cor-
responding to four framesets of the verbs olla (to
be), tulla (to come), tehd¨a (to do) and laittaa (to
put). The 26 (6%) null verb occurrences that did
not correspond to any of these four framesets were
assigned to a “leftover frameset”, for which no ar-
guments were marked.

5 Annotating the arguments on top of
the SD scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998572972973">
In contrast to the original PropBank, where any
syntactic constituent could be marked as an argu-
ment, we require arguments to be directly depen-
dent on the verb in the SD scheme (for an illustra-
tion, see Figure 5). This restriction is to consider-
ably simplify the annotation process — instead of
all possible subtrees, the annotator only needs to
look for direct dependents of the verb. In addition,
this constraint should naturally also simplify pos-
sible automatic identification and classification of
the arguments.
In addition to restricting arguments to direct de-
pendents of the verb, coordination dependencies
conj and sdep (implicit coordination of top level
independent clauses, see Figure 5) are left outside
the annotation scope. This is due to the nature of
the clinical language, which places on these de-
pendencies cause-consequence relationships that
require strong inference. For instance, sentences
such as Patient restless, given tranquilizers where
there is clearly a causal relationship but no explicit
marker such as thus or because, are common.
Naturally, it is necessary to estimate the effect
of these restrictions, which can be justified only
if the number of lost arguments is minimal. We
have conducted a small-scale experiment on 100
randomly selected sentences with at least one verb
that has a frameset assigned. We have provided
this portion of the clinical PropBank with a full an-
notation, including the arguments not governed by
the verb and those associated with conj and sdep
dependencies. For an illustration, see Figure 5.
There are in total 326 arguments and modifiers
(169 arguments and 157 modifiers) in the 100 sen-
tence sample. Of these, 278 (85%) are governed
by the verb in the basic SD scheme and are thus in
a direct syntactic relationship with the verb. Fur-

ther 19 (6%) arguments and modifiers are gov-
erned by the verb in the extended SD scheme. Out
of the remaining 29 (9%), 23 are in fact modi-
fiers, leaving only 6 numbered arguments not ac-
counted for in the extended SD scheme. Thus,
96% (163/169) of arguments and 85% (134/157)
of modifiers are directly governed by the verb.
Of the 23 ungoverned modifiers, all are either
cause (CAU) or consequence (CSQ)2. Of the sdep
and conj dependencies only a small portion (9/68)
were associated with an argument or a modifier,
all of which were in fact CAU or CSQ modifiers.
Both these and the CAU and CSQ modifiers not
governed by the verb reflect strongly inferred rela-
tionships between clauses.
Based on these figures, we conclude that an
overwhelming majority of arguments and modi-
fiers is governed by the verb in the extended SD
scheme and restricting the annotation to depen-
dents of the verb as well as leaving sdep and conj
outside the annotation scope seems justified. Ad-
ditionally, we demonstrate the utility of the con-
junct dependency propagation and external subject
marking in the extended SD scheme.

Many efforts have been made to capture meanings
and arguments of verbs. For instance, the VerbNet
project (Kipper et al., 2000) strives to create a
broad on-line verb lexicon, and FrameNet (Rup-
penhofer et al., 2005) aims to document the range
of valences of each verb in each of its senses. The
PropBank project (Palmer et al., 2005) strives for
a practical approach to semantic representation,
adding a layer of semantic role labels to the Penn
Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
In addition to the original PropBank by Palmer
et al., numerous PropBanks have been devel-
oped for languages other than English (e.g. Chi-
nese (Xue and Palmer, 2003) and Arabic (Diab
et al., 2008)). Also applications attempting to
automatically recover PropBank-style arguments
have been proposed. For example, the CoNLL
shared task has focused on semantic role labeling
four times, twice as a separate task (Carreras and
M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), and
twice in conjunction with syntactic parsing (Sur-
deanu et al., 2008; Hajiˇc et al., 2009).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999211875">
In this paper, we have presented a PropBank of
clinical Finnish, building a new layer of annotation
on top of the existing clinical treebank of Haver-
inen et al. (2009). This PropBank covers all 157
verbs occurring at least three times in the treebank
and accounts for 90% of all verb occurrences.
This work has also served as a test case for the
PropBank annotation scheme in two senses. First,
the scheme has been tested on a highly specialized
language, clinical Finnish, and second, its compa-
tibility with the SD syntactic scheme has been ex-
amined. On both accounts, we find the PropBank
scheme a suitable choice.
In general, the specialized language did not
seem to cause problems for the scheme. For in-
stance, the frequent null verbs could be analyzed
similarly to regular verbs, with full 94% belonging
to one of only four framesets. This is likely due to
the very restricted clinical domain of the corpus.
We also find a strong correspondence between
the PropBank arguments and the verb dependents
in the extended SD scheme, with 96% of argu-
ments and 85% of modifiers being directly gov-
erned by the verb. The 15% ungoverned modifiers
are cause-consequence relationships that require
strong inference. This correspondence allowed us
to simplify the annotation task by only considering
direct verb dependents as argument candidates.
The new version of the treebank, manually
anonymized, including the enhanced SD scheme
annotation and the PropBank annotation, is freely
available at http://bionlp.utu.fi.

This allows argument candidates to be restricted to direct verb dependents, substantially simplifying the PropBank construction. The clinical Finnish PropBank is freely available at the address http://bionlp.utu.fi. 1 Introduction Natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain has received substantial interest, with applications in decision support, patient managing and profiling, mining trends, and others (see the extensive review by Friedman and Johnson (2006)). While some of these applications, such as document retrieval and trend mining, can rely solely on word-frequency-based methods, others, such as information extraction and summarization require a detailed linguistic analysis capturing some of the sentence semantics. Among the most important steps in this direction is an analysis of verbs and their argument structures.

Among the most important steps in this direction is an analysis of verbs and their argument structures. In this work, we focus on the Finnish language in the clinical domain, analyzing its verbs and their argument structures using the PropBank scheme (Palmer et al., 2005). The choice of this particular scheme is motivated by its practical, application-oriented nature. We build the clinical Finnish PropBank on top of the existing dependency treebank of Haverinen et al. (2009). The primary outcome of this study is the PropBank of clinical Finnish itself, consisting of the analyses for 157 verbs with 2,382 occurrences and 4,763 arguments, and covering 90% of all verb occurrences in the underlying treebank. This PropBank, together with the treebank, is an important resource for the further development of clinical NLP applications for the Finnish language. We also establish the applicability of the PropBank scheme to the clinical sublanguage with its many atypical characteristics, and finally, we find that the PropBank scheme is compatible with the Stanford Dependency</context>

The text of the treebank comprises eight complete patient reports from an intensive care unit in a Finnish hospital. An intensive care patient report describes the condition of the patient and its development in time. The clinical Finnish in these reports has many characteristics typical of clinical languages, including frequent misspellings, abbreviations, domain terms, telegraphic style and non-standard syntactic structures (see Figure 2 for an illustration).

In semantic analysis of clinical language, Paek et al. (2006) have experimented on PropBankbased machine learning on abstracts of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), and Savova et al. (2009) have presented work on temporal relation discovery from clinical narratives. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a PropBank of clinical Finnish, building a new layer of annotation on top of the existing clinical treebank of Haverinen et al. (2009). This PropBank covers all 157 verbs occurring at least three times in the treebank and accounts for 90% of all verb occurrences. This work has also served as a test case for the PropBank annotation scheme in two senses. First, the scheme has been tested on a highly specialized language, clinical Finnish, and second, its compatibility with the SD syntactic scheme has been examined. On both accounts, we find the PropBank scheme a suitable choice. In general, the specialized language did not seem to cause problems for the scheme.

For instance, the VerbNet project (Kipper et al., 2000) strives to create a broad on-line verb lexicon, and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2005) aims to document the range of valences of each verb in each of its senses. The PropBank project (Palmer et al., 2005) strives for a practical approach to semantic representation, adding a layer of semantic role labels to the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). In addition to the original PropBank by Palmer et al., numerous PropBanks have been developed for languages other than English (e.g. Chinese (Xue and Palmer, 2003) and Arabic (Diab et al., 2008)). Also applications attempting to automatically recover PropBank-style arguments have been proposed. For example, the CoNLL shared task has focused on semantic role labeling four times, twice as a separate task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), and twice in conjunction with syntactic parsing (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajiˇc et al., 2009). 2CSQ is a new modifier subtype added by us, due to the restriction of only annotating direct syntactic dependents, which does not allow the annotation of all causal relationships with the type CAU.
