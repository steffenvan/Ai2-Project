The workshop on language processing for Central and Eastern European languages is organised this
year for the 4th time in conjunction with the RANLP series of conferences. Looking at the titles of
previous editions, one can see that they follow the development which NLP for those languages has
faced from one edition of RANLP to the other.
Recent activities in the language technology community in Europe are concerned with the combination/
pipelining of already developed systems and use of very large language resources. This approach
assumes that large language resources are available, that systems performances have been evaluated
on such resources and that input and output are interoperable with other systems. European initiatives
like CLARIN and FLAREET offer the frame for the development of a unified approach for languages
all over Europe. For the first time methodologies, evaluation campaigns and roadmaps are planed for
all European languages.
Language Processing is now seen as the main technology being able to give people access to
information (no matter where it has been produced) in their native languages. Unfortunately, despite
important developments, language resources for less popular languages, (especially Balkan and Slavic
languages) are still far behind the achieved standard for major western European ones.
As most part of the current Language Technology applications rely on corpus-based methods, one
major drawback in the development of language resources and tools for those languages is the lack
of training and evaluation data, as well as reference systems for comparing results. Although well-
known corpora like JRC-ACQUIS or OPUS are a significant step forward, they
- still do not cover all languages in the Balkan area,
- are collections of documents in specialised languages and therefore decrease the performance
of systems trained on those data when testing on another domain.
In order to shorten this bottleneck, it is absolutely necessary to develop, promote and make available
all data which can be used for training and evaluation. Additionally, it is important to know which
systems have been developed for which applications, on which data have been tested, and what
qualitative results have come out.
Therefore the workshop’s topic focuses this year on Multilingual resources, technologies and
evaluation for Central and Eastern European languages.
The selected papers for the current workshop proceedings focus on two issues: adaptation of tools for
other languages and multilingual systems and language resources. The eight papers cover ten Central
and Eastern European languages.
We would like to thank the authors for contributing to the workshop proceedings and the members of
the scientific committee for their quality work. We are grateful to the organisers of RANLP 2009 for
hosting this workshop as one of its satellite events. Especially we would like to thank Galia Angelova
and Kiril Simov for their great support throughout the whole organisation period.
