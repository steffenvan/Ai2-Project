INTRODUCTION

This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the HLT-NAACL 2004 Workshop:
Interdisciplinary Approaches to Speech Indexing and Retrieval held on May 6, 2004 in Boston.
For nearly a decade, speech indexing and retrieval have been a focus of research in two largely
independent communities, one at the intersection of speech recognition and information retrieval, a
second at the intersection of information science and digital libraries. Much has been learned, but
there has been remarkably little crossover between the two communities. As a result, we know a lot
about the technical requirements for audio indexing of broadcast materials, but the state of the art
for many other types of spoken word collections still depends on manual indexing or on automated
harvesting of associated text and metadata.
The goal of this workshop is to create a venue where experts on speech processing,
computational linguistics, information retrieval, and user needs can share their perspectives.
Specifically, we have focussed on:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9483692">
• User needs for end-user and intermediated search and browsing, including functional
requirements, interaction and interface design.
• Automated speech processing capabilities that can generate feature sets for use in downstream
processing, including speech recognition under difficult conditions, speaker detection and
verification, and characterization of prosody.
• Alignment and indexing techniques to exploit associated materials such as broadcast
production logs, scripts and transcripts, minutes of meetings, pictures of artifacts, and
metadata provided with audio streams.
• Segmentation, clustering, classification and annotation techniques, including those based on
speaker detection, topic characterization, acoustic condition, and discourse structure.

<bodyText confidence="0.859146">
To further reflect on this theme, the conference program also includes several invited talks from
researchers representing each of the areas identified above, panel discussions and submitted papers.
We wish to thank our program committee for reviewing the submitted papers and their active
participation in deciding the structure of this workshop. We are grateful to the organizers of HLT-
NAACL 2004 for their help in putting this workshop together.
