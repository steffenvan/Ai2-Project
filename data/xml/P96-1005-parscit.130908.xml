This paper deals with the discovery, rep-
resentation, and use of lexical rules (LRs)
during large-scale semi-automatic compu-
tational lexicon acquisition. The analy-
sis is based on a set of LRs implemented
and tested on the basis of Spanish and
English business- and finance-related cor-
pora. We show that, though the use of
LRs is justified, they do not come cost-
free. Semi-automatic output checking is re-
quired, even with blocking and preemtion
procedures built in. Nevertheless, large-
scope LRs are justified because they facili-
tate the unavoidable process of large-scale
semi-automatic lexical acquisition. We also
argue that the place of LRs in the compu-
tational process is a complex issue.

This paper deals with the discovery, representation,
and use of lexical rules (LRs) in the process of large-
scale semi-automatic computational lexicon acqui-
sition. LRs are viewed as a means to minimize the
need for costly lexicographic heuristics, to reduce the
number of lexicon entry types, and generally to make
the acquisition process faster and cheaper. The
findings reported here have been implemented and
tested on the basis of Spanish and English business-
and finance-related corpora.
The central idea of our approach — that there
are systematic paradigmatic meaning relations be-
tween lexical items, such that, given an entry for
one such item, other entries can be derived auto-
matically — is certainly not novel. In modern times,
it has been reintroduced into linguistic discourse
by the Meaning-Text group in their work on lex-
ical functions (see, for instance, (Mel&apos;6uk, 1979).

It has been lately incorporated into computational
lexicography in (Atkins, 1991), (Ostler and Atkins,
1992), (Briscoe and Copestake, 1991), (Copestake
and Briscoe, 1992), (Briscoe et al., 1993)).
Pustejovsky (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995) has coined
an attractive term to capture these phenomena: one
of the declared objectives of his &apos;generative lexi-
con&apos; is a departure from sense enumeration to sense
derivation with the help of lexical rules. The gen-
erative lexicon provides a useful framework for po-
tentially infinite sense modulation in specific con-
texts (cf. (Leech, 1981), (Cruse, 1986)), due to
type coercion (e.g., (Pustejovsky, 1993)) and simi-
lar phenomena. Most LRs in the generative lexi-
con approach, however, have been proposed for small
classes of words and explain such grammatical and
semantic shifts as +count to —count or —common
to +common.
While shifts and modulations are important, we
find that the main significance of LRs is their
promise to aid the task of massive lexical acqui-
sition.
Section 2 below outlines the nature of LRs in our
approach and their status in the computational pro-
cess. Section 3 presents a fully implemented case
study, the morpho-semantic LRs. Section 4 briefly
reviews the cost factors associated with LRs; the
argument in it is based on another case study, the
adjective-related LRs, which is especialy instructive
since it may mislead one into thinking that. LRs are
unconditionally beneficial.

2 Nature of Lexical Rules
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995131">
2.1 Ontological- Semantic Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988111111111">
Our approach to NLP can be characterized as
ontology-driven semantics (see, e.g., (Nirenburg and
Levin, 1992)). The lexicon for which our LRs are in-
troduced is intended to support the computational
specification and use of text meaning representa-
tions. The lexical entries are quite complex, as
they must contain many different types of lexical
knowledge that may be used by specialist processes
for automatic text analysis or generation (see, e.g.,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998186">

<bodyText confidence="0.999972607142858">
(Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1995), for a detailed
description). The acquisition of such a lexicon, with
or without the assistance of LRs, involves a substan-
tial investment of time and resources. The meaning
of a lexical entry is encoded in a (lexical) semantic
representation language (see, e.g., (Nirenburg et al.,
1992)) whose primitives are predominantly terms in
an independently motivated world model, or ontol-
ogy (see, e.g., (Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990) and
(Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995)).
The basic unit of the lexicon is a `superentry,&apos; one
for each citation form holds, irrespective of its lexi-
cal class. Word senses are called &apos;entries.&apos; The LR
processor applies to all the word senses for a given
superentry. For example, pronunciar has (at least)
two entries (one could be translated as &amp;quot;articulate&amp;quot;
and one as &amp;quot;declare&amp;quot;); the LR generator, when ap-
plied to the superentry, would produce (among oth-
ers) two forms of pronunciacion, derived from each
of those two senses/entries.
The nature of the links in the lexicon to the ontol-
ogy is critical to the entire issue of LRs. Represen-
tations of lexical meaning may be defined in terms
of any number of ontological primitives, called con-
cepts. Any of the concepts in the ontology may be
used (singly or in combination) in a lexical meaning
representation.
No necessary correlation is expected between syn-
tactic category and properties and semantic or onto-
logical classification and properties (and here we def-
initely part company with syntax-driven semantics—
see, for example, (Levin, 1992), (Dorr, 1993) —pretty
much along the lines established in (Nirenburg and
Levin, 1992). For example, although meanings of
many verbs are represented through reference to on-
tological EVENTS and a number of nouns are rep-
resented by concepts from the OBJECT sublattice,
frequently nominal meanings refer to EVENTs and
verbal meanings to OBJECTS. Many LRs produce
entries in which the syntactic category of the input
form is changed; however, in our model, the seman-
tic category is preserved in many of these LRs. For
example, the verb destroy may be represented by
an EVENT, as will the noun destruction (naturally,
with a different linking in the syntax-semantics in-
terface). Similarly, destroyer (as a person) would
be represented using the same event with the addi-
tion of a HUMAN as a filler of the agent case role.
This built-in transcategoriality strongly facilitates
applications such as interlingual MT, as it renders
vacuous many problems connected with category
mismatches (Kameyama et al., 1991) and misalign-
ments or divergences (Dorr, 1995), (Heid, 1993) that
plague those paradigms in MT which do not rely on
extracting language-neutral text meaning represen-
tations. This transcategoriality is supported by LRs.

2.2 Approaches to LRs and Their Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995666666667">
In reviewing the theoretical and computational lin-
guistics literature on LRs, one notices a number of
different delimitations of LRs from morphology, syn-
tax, lexicon, and processing. Below we list three
parameters which highlight the possible differences
among approaches to LRs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997431">
2.2.1 Scope of Phenomena
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767444444444">
Depending on the paradigm or approach, there are
phenomena which may be more—or less—appropriate
for treatment by LRs than by syntactic transfor-
mations, lexical enumeration, or other mechanisms.
LRs offer greater generality and productivity at the
expense of overgeneration, i.e., suggesting inappro-
priate forms which need to be weeded out before ac-
tual inclusion in a lexicon. The following phenomena
seem to be appropriate for treatment with LRs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976564210526316">
• Inflected Forms - Specifically, those inflectional
phenomena which accompany changes in sub-
categorization frame (pa.ssivization, dative al-
ternation, etc.).
• Word Formation - The production of derived
forms by LR is illustrated in a case study be-
low, and includes formation of deverbal nom-
inals (destruction, running), agentive nouns
(catcher). Typically involving a shift in syn-
tactic category, these LRs are often less pro-
ductive than inflection-oriented ones. Conse-
quently, derivational LRs are even more prone
to overgeneration than inflectional LRs.
• Regular Polysemy - This set of phenomena
includes regular polysemies or regular non-
metaphoric and non-metonymic alternations
such as those described in (Apresjan, 1974),
(Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995), (Ostler and Atkins,
1992) and others.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.50995">
2.2.2 When Should LRs Be Applied?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8790096">
Once LRs are defined in a computational scenario,
a decision is required about the time of application
of those rules. In a particular system, LRs can be
applied at acquisition time, at lexicon load time and
at run time.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980934214285714">
• Acquisition Time - The major advantage of this
strategy is that the results of any LR expansion
can be checked by the lexicon acquirer, though
at the cost of substantial additional time. Even
with the best left-hand side (LHS) conditions
(see below), the lexicon acquirer may be flooded
by new lexical entries to validate. During the re-
view process, the lexicographer can accept the
generated form, reject it as inappropriate, or
make minor modifications. If the LR is being
used to build the lexicon up from scratch, then
mechanisms used by Ostler and Atkins (Ostler
and Atkins, 1992) or (Briscoe et al., 1995), such
as blocking or preemption, are not available as

automatic mechanisms for avoiding overgenera-
tion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990468538461538">
• Lexicon Load Time - The LRs can be applied
to the base lexicon at the time the lexicon is
loaded into the computational system. As with
run-time loading, the risk is that overgenera-
tion will cause more degradation in accuracy
than the missing (derived) forms if the LRs were
not applied in the first place. If the LR inven-
tory approach is used or if the LHS constraints
are very good (see below), then the overgener-
ation penalty is minimized, and the advantage
of a large run-time lexicon is combined with ef-
ficiency in look-up and disk savings.
• Run Time - Application of LRs at run time
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964257125">
raises additional difficulties by not supporting
an index of all the head forms to be used by the
syntactic and semantic processes. For example,
if there is an LR which produces abusive-adj2
from abuse-v1, the adjectival form will be un-
known to the syntactic parser, and its produc-
tion would only be triggered by failure recovery
mechanisms — if direct lookup failed and the
reverse morphological process identified abuse-
vl as a potential source of the entry needed.
A hybrid scenario of LR use is also plausible,
where, for example, LRs apply at acquisition tune to
produce new lexical entries, but may also be avail-
able at run time as an error recovery strategy to
attempt generation of a form or word sense not al-
ready found in the lexicon.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.913035">
2.2.3 LR Triggering Conditions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996505375">
For any of the LR application opportunities item-
ized above, a methodology needs to be developed
for the selection of the subset of LRs which are ap-
plicable to a given lexical entry (whether base or
derived). Otherwise, the LRs will grossly overgen-
erate, resulting in inappropriate entries, computa-
tional inefficiency, and degradation of accuracy. Two
approaches suggest themselves.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.785165">
• LR Itemization - The simplest mechanism of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.954108818181818">
rule triggering is to include in each lexicon en-
try an explicit list of applicable rules. Lit ap-
plication can be chained, so that the rule chains
are expanded, either statically, in the speci-
fication, or dynamically, at application time.
This approach avoids any inappropriate appli-
cation of the rules (overgeneration), though at
the expense of tedious work at lexicon acquisi-
tion time. One drawback of this strategy is that
if a new LR is added, each lexical entry needs
to be revisited and possibly updated.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96088175">
• Rule LIIS Constraints - The other approach is
to maintain a bank of LRs, and rely on their
LIISs to constrairi the application of the rules to
only the appropriate cases; in practice, however,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999834916666666">
it is difficult to set up the constraints in such a
way as to avoid over- or undergeneration a pri-
ori. Additionally, this approach (at least, when
applied after acquisition time) does not allow
explicit ordering of word senses, a practice pre-
ferred by many lexicographers to indicate rela-
tive frequency or salience; this sort of informa-
tion can be captured by other mechanisms (e.g.,
using frequency-of-occurrence statistics). This
approach does, however, capture the paradig-
matic generalization that is represented by the
rule, and simplifies lexical acquisition.

3 Morpho-Semantics and
Constructive Derivational
Morphology: a Transcategorial
Approach to Lexical Rules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914828571428">
In this section, we present a case study of LRs based
on constructive derivational morphology. Such LRs
automatically produce word forms which are poly-
semous, such as the Spanish generador &apos;generator,&apos;
either the artifact or someone who generates. The
LRs have been tested in a real world application, in-
volving the semi-automatic acquisition of a Spanish
computational lexicon of about 35,000 word senses.
We accelerated the process of lexical acquisition&apos;
by developing morpho-semantic LRs which, when
applied to a lexeme, produced an average of 25 new
candidate entries. Figure 1 below illustrates the
overall process of generating new entries from a ci-
tation form, by applying morpho-semantic LRs.
Generation of new entries usually starts with
verbs. Each verb found in the corpora is submitted
to the morpho-semantic generator which produces
all its morphological derivations and, based on a de-
tailed set of tested heuristics, attaches to each form
an appropriate semantic LR label, for instance, the
nominal form comprador will be among the ones gen-
erated from the verb comprar and the semantic LR
&amp;quot;agent-of&amp;quot; is attached to it. The mechanism of rule
application is illustrated below.
The form list generated by the niorpho-semantic
generator is checked against three MRDs (Collins
Spanish-English, Simon and Schuster Spanish-
English, and Larousse Spanish) and the forms found
in them are submitted to the acquisition process.
However, forms not found in the dictionaries are not
discarded outright because the MRDs cannot be as-
sumed to be complete and some of these &amp;quot;rejected&amp;quot;
forms can, in fact, be found in corpora or in the
input text of an application system. This mecha-
nism works because we rely on linguistic clues and

therefore our system does not grossly overgenerate
candidates.
The Lexical Rule Processor is an engine which
produces a new entry from an existing one, such
as the new entry compra (Figure 3) produced from
the verb entry comprar (Figure 2) after applying the
LR2event rule.2
The acquirer must check the definition and enter
an example, but the rest of the information is sim-
ply retained. The LEXical-RULES zone specifies the
morpho-semantic rule which was applied to produce
this new entry and the verb it has been applied to.
The morpho-semantic generator produces all pre-
dictable morphonological derivations with their
morpho-lexico-semantic associations, using three
major sources of clues: 1) word-forms with their cor-
responding morpho-semantic classification; 2) stem
alternations and 3) construction mechanisms. The
patterns of attachement include unification, concate-
nation and output rules3. For instance beber can be

derived into bebNdero, bebekldor, beb[i]do, beb[i]da,
volver into vaelto, and communicar into telecommu-
nicacion, etc... All affixes are assigned semantic fea-
tures. For instance, the morpho-semantic rule LRpo-
larity_negative is at least attached to all verbs belong-
ing to the -AR class of Spanish verbs, whose initial
stem is of the form &apos;con&apos;, `tra&apos;, or &apos;fir&apos; with the corre-
sponding allomorph -in attached to it (incontrolable,

rules which are later used to actually generate the

citation forms with 1263 senses among them. The
rules helped acquire an average of 25 candidate new
entries per verb sense, thus producing a total of
31,680 candidate entries.
From the 26 different citation forms shown in Fig-

In this example no forms rejected by the dic-
tionaries were found in the corpora, and therefore
there was no reason to generate these new entries.
However, the citation forms supercompra, precom-

other corpora, so that entries for them could be gen-

4 The Cost of Lexical Rules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992922821428571">
It is clear by now that LRs are most useful in large-
scale acquisition. In the process of Spanish acquisi-
tion, 20% of all entries were created from scratch by
PI-level lexicographers and 80% were generated by
LRs and checked by research associates. It should
be made equally clear, however, that the use of LRs
is not cost-free. Besides the effort of discovering and
implementing them, there is also the significant time
and effort expenditure on the procedure of semi-
automatic checking of the results of the application
of LRs to the basic entries, such as those for the
verbs.
The shifts and modulations studied in the litera-
ture in connection with the LRs and generative lex-
icon have also been shown to be not problem-free:
sometimes the generation processes are blocked—or
preempted—for a variety of lexical, semantic and
other reasons (see (Ostler and Atkins, 1992)). In
fact, the study of blocking processes, their view as
systemic rather than just a bunch of exceptions, is
by itself an interesting enterprise (see (Briscoe et al.,
1995)).
Obviously, similar problems occur in real-life
large-scale lexical rules as well. Even the most seem-
ingly regular processes do not typically go through
in 100% of all cases. This makes the LR-affected
entries not generable fully automatically and this is
why each application of an LR to a qualifying phe-

nomenon must be checked manually in the process
of acquisition.
Adjectives provide a good case study for that. The
acquisition of adjectives in general (see (Raskin and
Nirenburg, 1995)) results in the discovery and ap-
plication of several large-scope lexical rules, and it
appears that no exceptions should be expected. Ta-
ble 1 illustrates examples of LRs discovered and used
in adjective entries.
The first three and the last rule are truly large-
scope rules. Out of these, the -able rule seems to be
the most homogeneous and &apos;error-proof.&apos; Around
300 English adjectives out of the 6,000 or so, which
occur in the intersection of LDOCE and the 1987-89
Wall Street Journal corpora, end in -able.
About 87% of all the -able adjectives are like read-
able: they mean, basically, something that can be
read. In other words, they typically modify the noun
which is the theme (or beneficiary, if animate) of the
verb from which the adjective is derived:
One can read the book.—The book is readable.
The temptation to mark all the verbs as capable
of assuming the suffix -able (or -ible) and forming
adjectives with this type of meaning is strong, but it
cannot be done because of various forms of blocking
or preemption. Verbs like kill, relate, or necessitate
do not form such adjectives comfortably or at all.
Adjectives like audible or legible do conform to the
formula above, but they are derived, as it were, from
suppletive verbs, hear and read, respectively. More
distressingly, however, a complete acquisition pro-
cess for these adjectives uncovers 17 different com-
binations of semantic roles for the nouns modified
by the -ble adjectives, involving, besides the &amp;quot;stan-
dard&amp;quot; theme or beneficiary roles, the agent, experi-
encer, location, and even the entire event expressed
by the verb. It is true that some of these combi-
nations are extremely rare (e.g. perishable), and all
together they account for under 40 adjectives. The
point remains, however, that each case has to be
checked manually (well, semi-automatically, because
the same tools that we have developed for acquisi-
tion are used in checking), so that the exact meaning
of the derived adjective with regard to that of the
verb itself is determined. It turns out also that, for a
polysemous verb, the adjective does not necessarily
inherit all its meanings (e.g., perishable again).

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999970651162791">
In this paper, we have discussed several aspects of
the discovery, representation, and implementation of
LRs, where, we believe, they count, namely, in the
actual process of developing a realistic-size, real-life
NLP system. Our LRs tend to be large-scope rules,
which saves us a lot of time and effort on massive
lexical acquisition.
Research reported in this paper has exhibited a
finer grain size of description of morphemic seman-
tics by recognizing more meaning components of
non-root morphemes than usually acknowledged.
The reported research concentrated on lexical
rules for derivational morphology. The same mecha-
nism has been shown, in small-scale experiments, to
work for other kinds of lexical regularities, notably
cases of regular polysemy (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins,
1992), (Apresjan, 1974)).
Our treatment of transcategoriality allows for a
lexicon superentry to contain senses which are not
simply enumerated. The set of entries in a superen-
try can be seen as an hierarchy of a few &amp;quot;original&amp;quot;
senses and a number of senses derived from them
according to well-defined rules. Thus, the argument
between the sense-enumeration and sense-derivation
schools in computational lexicography may be shown
to be of less importance than suggested by recent lit-
erature.
Our lexical rules are quite different from the lex-
ical rules used in lexically-based grammars (such as
(GPSG, (Gazdar et al., 1985) or sign-based theories
(HPSG, (Pollard and Sag, 1987)), as the latter can
rather be viewed as linking rules and often deal with
issues such as subcategorization.
The issue of when to apply the lexical rules in a
computational environment is relatively new. More
studies must be made to determine the most bene-
ficial place of LRs in a computational process.
Finally, it is also clear that each LR comes at a cer-
tain human-labor and computational expense, and if
the applicability, or &amp;quot;payload,&amp;quot; of a rule is limited,
its use may not be worth the extra effort. We cannot
say at this point that LRs provide any advantages
in computation or quality of the deliverables. What

<abstract confidence="0.998889333333333">This paper deals with the discovery, representation, and use of lexical rules (LRs) during large-scale semi-automatic computational lexicon acquisition. The analysis is based on a set of LRs implemented and tested on the basis of Spanish and English businessand finance-related corpora. We show that, though the use of LRs is justified, they do not come costfree. Semi-automatic output checking is required, even with blocking and preemtion procedures built in. Nevertheless, largescope LRs are justified because they facilitate the unavoidable process of large-scale semi-automatic lexical acquisition. We also argue that the place of LRs in the computational process is a complex issue.</abstract>

Even with the best left-hand side (LHS) conditions (see below), the lexicon acquirer may be flooded by new lexical entries to validate. During the review process, the lexicographer can accept the generated form, reject it as inappropriate, or make minor modifications. If the LR is being used to build the lexicon up from scratch, then mechanisms used by Ostler and Atkins (Ostler and Atkins, 1992) or (Briscoe et al., 1995), such as blocking or preemption, are not available as 33 automatic mechanisms for avoiding overgeneration. • Lexicon Load Time - The LRs can be applied to the base lexicon at the time the lexicon is loaded into the computational system. As with run-time loading, the risk is that overgeneration will cause more degradation in accuracy than the missing (derived) forms if the LRs were not applied in the first place. If the LR inventory approach is used or if the LHS constraints are very good (see below), then the overgeneration penalty is minimized, and the advantage of a large run-time lexicon i</context>

The shifts and modulations studied in the literature in connection with the LRs and generative lexicon have also been shown to be not problem-free: sometimes the generation processes are blocked—or preempted—for a variety of lexical, semantic and other reasons (see (Ostler and Atkins, 1992)). In fact, the study of blocking processes, their view as systemic rather than just a bunch of exceptions, is by itself an interesting enterprise (see (Briscoe et al., 1995)). Obviously, similar problems occur in real-life large-scale lexical rules as well. Even the most seemingly regular processes do not typically go through in 100% of all cases.

The acquisition of such a lexicon, with or without the assistance of LRs, involves a substantial investment of time and resources. The meaning of a lexical entry is encoded in a (lexical) semantic representation language (see, e.g., (Nirenburg et al., 1992)) whose primitives are predominantly terms in an independently motivated world model, or ontology (see, e.g., (Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990) and (Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995)).

The nature of the links in the lexicon to the ontology is critical to the entire issue of LRs. Representations of lexical meaning may be defined in terms of any number of ontological primitives, called concepts. Any of the concepts in the ontology may be used (singly or in combination) in a lexical meaning representation. No necessary correlation is expected between syntactic category and properties and semantic or ontological classification and properties (and here we definitely part company with syntax-driven semantics— see, for example, (Levin, 1992), (Dorr, 1993) —pretty much along the lines established in (Nirenburg and Levin, 1992). For example, although meanings of many verbs are represented through reference to ontological EVENTS and a number of nouns are represented by concepts from the OBJECT sublattice, frequently nominal meanings refer to EVENTs and verbal meanings to OBJECTS. Many LRs produce entries in which the syntactic category of the input form is changed; however, in our model, the semantic category is preserved in many of these LRs. For example, the verb destroy may be represented by an EVENT, as will the noun destruction (naturally, w</context>

Once LRs are defined in a computational scenario, a decision is required about the time of application of those rules. In a particular system, LRs can be applied at acquisition time, at lexicon load time and at run time. • Acquisition Time - The major advantage of this strategy is that the results of any LR expansion can be checked by the lexicon acquirer, though at the cost of substantial additional time. Even with the best left-hand side (LHS) conditions (see below), the lexicon acquirer may be flooded by new lexical entries to validate. During </context>

Besides the effort of discovering and implementing them, there is also the significant time and effort expenditure on the procedure of semiautomatic checking of the results of the application of LRs to the basic entries, such as those for the verbs. The shifts and modulations studied in the literature in connection with the LRs and generative lexicon have also been shown to be not problem-free: sometimes the generation processes are blocked—or preempted—for a variety of lexical, semantic and other reasons (see (Ostler and Atkins, 1992)). In fact, the study of blocking processes, their view as systemic rather than just a bunch of exceptions, is by itself an interesting enterprise (see (Briscoe et al., 1995)). Obviously, similar problems occur in real-life large-scale lexical rules as well. Even the most seemingly regular processes do not typically go through in 100% of all cases.

Our LRs tend to be large-scope rules, which saves us a lot of time and effort on massive lexical acquisition. Research reported in this paper has exhibited a finer grain size of description of morphemic semantics by recognizing more meaning components of non-root morphemes than usually acknowledged. The reported research concentrated on lexical rules for derivational morphology. The same mechanism has been shown, in small-scale experiments, to work for other kinds of lexical regularities, notably cases of regular polysemy (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins, 1992), (Apresjan, 1974)). Our treatment of transcategoriality allows for a lexicon superentry to contain senses which are not simply enumerated. The set of entries in a superentry can be seen as an hierarchy of a few &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; senses and a number of senses derived from them according to well-defined rules. Thus, the argument between the sense-enumeration and sense-derivation schools in computational lexicography may be shown to be of less importance than suggested by recent literature.

The issue of when to apply the lexical rules in a computational environment is relatively new. More studies must be made to determine the most beneficial place of LRs in a computational process. Finally, it is also clear that each LR comes at a certain human-labor and computational expense, and if the applicability, or &amp;quot;payload,&amp;quot; of a rule is limited, its use may not be worth the extra effort.

Once LRs are defined in a computational scenario, a decision is required about the time of application of those rules. In a particular system, LRs can be applied at acquisition time, at lexicon load time and at run time. • Acquisition Time - The major advantage of this strategy is that the results of any LR expansion can be checked by the lexicon acquirer, though at the cost of substantial additional time. Even with the best left-hand side (LHS) conditions (see below), the lexicon acquirer may be flooded by new le</context>

Pustejovsky (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995) has coined an attractive term to capture these phenomena: one of the declared objectives of his &apos;generative lexicon&apos; is a departure from sense enumeration to sense derivation with the help of lexical rules. The generative lexicon provides a useful framework for potentially infinite sense modulation in specific contexts (cf. (Leech, 1981), (Cruse, 1986)), due to type coercion (e.g., (Pustejovsky, 1993)) and similar phenomena. Most LRs in the generative lexicon approach, however, have been proposed for small classes of words and explain such grammatical and semantic shifts as +count to —count or —common to +common. While shifts and modulations are important, we find that the main significance of LRs is their promise to aid the task of massive lexical acquisition. Section 2 below outlines the nature of LRs in our approach and their status in the computational process. Section 3 presents a fully implemented case study, the morpho-semantic LRs. Section 4 briefly reviews the cost factors associa</context>

Adjectives provide a good case study for that. The acquisition of adjectives in general (see (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995)) results in the discovery and application of several large-scope lexical rules, and it appears that no exceptions should be expected. Table 1 illustrates examples of LRs discovered and used in adjective entries. The first three and the last rule are truly largescope rules. Out of these, the -able rule seems to be the most homogeneous and &apos;error-proof.&apos; Around 300 English adjectives out of the 6,000 or so, which occur in the intersection of LDOCE and the 1987-89 Wall Street Journal corpora, end in -able. About 87% of all the -able adjectives are like readable: they mean, basically, something t</context>
