Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999951458333333">
Writing today, whether professional, academic, or private, relies heavily on computers. Most texts
composed in the 21st century are probably written on computers or other electronic devices, such as
mobile phones. People compose texts in word processors, text editors, content management systems,
blogs, wikis, e-mail clients, and instant messaging applications. Each of these tools supports authors in
different ways and to different degrees.
Writing research has been concerned with word processing since the 1970s. Writing researchers today
investigate specific characteristics of writing with computers and the effect of tools on writing processes.
The current rise of new writing environments and genres (e.g., blogging) has prompted new studies in
this area of research.
During the last few decades, computational linguistics has mostly been concerned with static or
finished texts. We believe there is now a growing need to explore how computational linguistics can
support human text production and word processing. However, there are still very few projects where
computational linguists and writing researchers work together here.
The Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Writing (CL&amp;W 2010) provides an overview of
current developments in the area of computational linguistics for authoring aids, and an overview
of recent advances in writing research. CL&amp;W 2010 continues and builds on the workshops on
authoring aids at the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC
2008) and the 2008 Swedish Language Technology Conference (SLTC 2008). The papers included
here present research that explores writing processes and text production, as well as actual systems
that support writers. In both areas, research on all languages is relevant, including less-resourced
languages. CL&amp;W 2010 brings together researchers from both communities, to identify areas where
computational linguistics and writing research can benefit from each other and to stimulate discussion
and interdisciplinary cooperation between these two areas of research.
In our call for papers we posed some questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.947402052631579">
• How can writing be supported by methods, resources, and tools from computational linguistics?
This includes NLP tools and techniques that can be used or have been used to support writing
(e.g., grammar and style checking, document structuring, thematic segmentation, and editing and
revision aids).
• How can we gain a better understanding of writing processes, strategies, and needs? How can
techniques from HCI research and psychology help us to gain new insights into the composition
and writing processes, and to improve writing tools?
• Which methods, resources, and tools from computational linguistics might support research in
this area?
• How do high-level writing processes and the mechanics of writing relate to each other?
• How does the tool used influence composition (including editing and revising)? Are writers aware
of the possibilities and limitations of their writing tools?
iii
• Is there a need for the development of new writing tools? What can we learn from earlier
approaches and tools like RUSKIN, Writer’s Workbench, or Augment, or from source code
editors for programming languages?
• How can insights from writing research and methods from computational linguistics help to
support the needs of particular user groups (e.g., foreign language learners, children, persons
with disabilities)?

<bodyText confidence="0.999714444444445">
We received 15 submissions from both computational linguists and writing researchers. After a rigorous
review process we selected 9 papers for the workshop. We would like to thank the members of the
Program Committee for their excellent work—the reviews were all very thorough, carefully written,
detailed, and helped the authors to improve their papers.
The papers cover a variety of topics, ranging from actually working—and freely available!—systems to
support novice and expert authors, to more general thoughts on the intersection of writing research and
computational linguistics. We are pleased to present these papers in this volume.
We hope the work presented here will trigger discussion and collaboration between researchers,
bringing together expertise and interest from writing research and computational linguistics.
