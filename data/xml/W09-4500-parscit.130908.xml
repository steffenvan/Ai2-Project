Welcome to the Biomedical Information Extraction Workshop
at RANLP09!
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941041666667">
Undoubtly, the availability of information for biomedicine in an electronic format has been rapidly
increasing. The Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval system (Medline) houses millions of
biomedical scientific literature publications. PubMed offers the power of a search engine for accessing
the Medline content. On the other hand, the electronization of clinical data within the Electronic
Medical Record (EMR) provides another powerful source for information extraction. Access to
integrated information is critical for health care improvement, research, and the overall science of
healthcare delivery and personalized medicine. Information extraction from the scientific literature
is distinct from information extraction from the clinical narrative as these two types of genre have
their own stylistic characteristics and pose different methodological challenges. Moreover, biomedical
information spans multiple languages thus necessitating methods for multi-lingual information
extraction.
In addition to the biomedical scientific literature and clinical data, we need also to consider the
large number of health related web resources that is increasing day by day. The content of these
resources is rather variable and difficult to assess. Furthermore, the number of people searching for
health-related information is also increasing. The development of tools to support the process of
describing the content of medical web resources with meta-data that facilitate their retrieval, and with
quality labels by certified authorities, is crucial for the delivery of content of better quality to health
information consumers. Multi-lingual information extraction has a significant role to play there also.
The focus of this workshop is natural language processing and information extraction for biomedicine,
including scientific and clinical free-text as well as health-related web resources within one or many
languages. The presentations accepted for inclusion in the workshop are divided into two main groups:
full papers and pilot project notes. The full papers describe mature investigative efforts, while the
project notes showcase preliminary results on work-in-progress. The topics covered by the full-papers
and the pilot project notes span a range:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996405176470588">
• Natural language processing techniques for basic tasks, e.g. sentence boundary detection,
tokenization, part of speech tagging, shallow parsing and deep parsing. Evaluation and
comparison with the general domain;
• Efforts to create sharable biomedical lexical resources, including the annotation of biomedical
data for linguistic and domain events;
• Biomedical named entity recognition;
• Methods for higher level biomedical language processing, e.g. relation discovery, temporal
relation discovery, anaphoric relation discovery;
• Terminology/ontology biomedical named entity mapping;
• Integrated knowledge management of scientific and clinical free-text data;
iii
• Knowledge representation and management technologies (e.g. OWL, RDF, Annotation Schemas,
etc.) that enable the creation of machine-processable descriptions of health-related web
resources;
• Content collection and information extraction techniques that allow the quality labeling of web
resources and the continuous monitoring of already labeled ones;
• Multi-lingual information extraction.

We hope that this 1st workshop on Biomedical Information Extraction becomes a tradition within the
RANLP conference. We would like to thank all the authors for their efforts in making it a highly
productive workshop and a lively venue for exchange of scientific ideas! We invite you to consider
submitting to the 2nd edition of the workshop as part of RANLP-2011.
