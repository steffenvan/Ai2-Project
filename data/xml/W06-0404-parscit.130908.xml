The literature investigating the notion
of presupposition in Discourse Represen-
tation Theory (DRT) has mainly been
dubbed as being semantic (Simons 2003).
This paper investigates the linguistic ap-
plication of pragmatic-based constraints to
the ‘semantic’ notion of presupposition in
DRT. By applying pragmatic-based con-
straints to presuppositional phenomenon,
we aim to defend DRT against the accu-
sation that DRT’s interpretation of presup-
positional phenomenon is essentially ‘se-
mantic’ and push this interpretation fur-
ther towards the pragmatic side of the se-
mantic/pragmatic interface.1

Devising an appropriate theory of presupposition
has been one of the main issues in semantics, prag-
matics and most recently computational linguis-
tics. Indeed, many theorists have argued exten-
sively about the definition that captures the mean-
ing of presupposition and whether presuppositions
are a property of the utterance or of the speaker.
Developments in dynamic semantics, as opposed
to static semantics, resulting in DRT, have led
to a framework suitable for the representation of
linguistic phenomenon. Some of DRT’s princi-
pal concerns are with finding the right truth con-
ditions and interpretation for referential expres-
sions, specifically anaphora. This is relevant for
further investigation of ‘pragmatic’ presupposition
because it has in fact been proposed by van der

Sandt and Geurts (1991) that it is anaphora that
lies at the basis of presupposition.
However, Simons (2003) has recently noted
some pragmatic limitations in the present state of
DRT. She refers in the following quotation to ‘dy-
namic semantics’, the field taken to include DRT.
Dynamic semantics does not attempt
to understand presupposition and pre-
suppositional constraints in terms of
the speaker’s beliefs and intentions, or
to root presuppositional constraints in
terms of the broad goals of communica-
tors (Simons 2003: 27).
Indeed, Simons concludes that DRT is a the-
ory of semantic and not pragmatic presupposition
(2003). The criticism that DRT is only semantic
is not wholly justified. While DRT stems from
the need for appropriate semantic representation
of discourse, DRT does recognize the importance
of context in representing referents in discourse,
which is generally taken to mark a pragmatic per-
spective on presupposition. Additionally, theories
within DRT, such as the Binding Theory (Geurts
1999), have attempted to make DRT more prag-
matic; in particular, Presupposition as Anaphora
Theory’s construction process of presupposition
(van der Sandt and Geurts 1991). However, while
this paper aims to show that DRT is not entirely
devoid of pragmatics, it argues that DRT is in need
of a more pragmatic treatment of presupposition,
which (a) pays more attention to the beliefs and
intentions of the speaker and the hearer and their
relation to presupposition and (b) makes presup-
positional constraints more precise. Further, other
scholars have criticized DRT for being essentially
truthconditional. Werth, for example, claims that
DRT is essentially only about truthconditionality:

[DRT’s] goal is truth-conditionality and
its models are minimal worlds inhabited
by predicates and variables... it does not
model human understanding: there is no
place in it for participant roles, setting,
background knowledge, purposes, even
inferences (Werth 1999: 65).
Again, this criticism is not entirely just. To address
the aforementioned pragmatic limitations of DRT,
the aim of this paper is to address the problem
of insightfully capturing pragmatic constraints on
presuppositional phenomenon within the frame-
work of DRT. To achieve this, a pragmatically-
constrained definition of presupposition is at-
tempted. This is followed by setting some prag-
matic constraints on agents’ conception of presup-
positional phrases based on the agents’ roles in
conversation. An example of how these pragmatic
constraints operate in DRT is then examined. Fur-
thermore, an overall structure computationally en-
compassing these pragmatic constraints in DRT is
described.

2 Pragmatic-based Presupposition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986714285714">
In linguistics the treatment of presupposition has
generally been split between two camps, seman-
tics and pragmatics. Karttunen (1973) maintains
that the semantic perspective on presupposition
sees presupposition as emanating from the sen-
tence, and the pragmatic perspective as emanat-
ing from the speaker. Levinson argues that pre-
supposition cannot be viewed as semantic in the
narrow sense (based on formal logic and truth con-
ditionality), but rather as dependent on context
and ‘the actual linguistic structure of sentences’
(Levinson 1983: 167). Theories defining presup-
position within pragmatics depend mainly on mu-
tual knowledge (or common ground).
Within computational linguistics the treatment
of presupposition falls mainly within dynamic se-
mantics, within which DRT has developed. In the
broadest terms presupposition, whether in linguis-
tics or philosophy, has been viewed as a relation
between sentences or propositions, where the pre-
supposed proposition is not in focus in the presup-
position sentence. DRT, and dynamic semantics in
general, is precisely concerned with such relations
– i.e. with the relations between an utterance and
previous utterances in the discourse.
Given these varying definitions as to what con-
stitutes presupposition, before attempting to in-
troduce pragmatic constraints to presupposition in
DRT, we must first explain what pragmatic presup-
position, as used in this paper, constitutes. Two
important notions come into question when as-
sessing what constitutes presupposition, namely,
the notion of givenness and the relationship be-
tween the beliefs (or the cognitive states) of the
agents involved in a conversation.

2.1 Presupposition and Givenness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954317073171">
While presuppositions can be defined as that part
of the utterance that is taken to be ‘given’ (Lam-
brecht 1994), the notion of ‘given’ needs clari-
fying. ‘Given’ means known information, infor-
mation that the speaker regards as known to both
speaker and hearer - information directly relating
to the topic of the dialogue or as part of gen-
eral background knowledge assumptions about the
world. The presupposition in this sense is a re-
flection of the speaker’s assumptions about the
hearer’s state of mind, i.e. the speaker assumes the
hearer already knows this information (Lambrecht
1994). An alternate meaning of ‘given’ is when
the speaker knows that the information the presup-
position provides is, in fact, new to the hearer. In
this case, the speaker introduces the new informa-
tion ‘as if’ it were given, in order to indicate that
the presupposed information is not the focus of
the speaker’s attention. Unlike Stalnaker’s under-
standing of presupposition (Stalnaker 2002), this
understanding of ‘given’ to include information
new to the hearer means that the presupposition
introduced is not necessarily part of what is often
termed the ‘common ground’.
Thus, we might think in terms of a speaker
‘packaging’ information as a presupposition
(speaker presupposition). In this approach, the
speaker has the choice of picking information she
deems to be known to the hearer or information
that she deems to be new to the hearer, knowing
that to do so, she (the speaker) is communicating
that the presupposition is not the focus of her ut-
terance, but rather she would like the hearer to di-
rect his attention to the new information provided
by the rest of the utterance. For new, presupposed
information to pass as given, the speaker must be
aware that introducing an ‘out of the ordinary’ or
‘remarkable’ presupposition will cause problems.
For instance, example (1) is less likely to cause
problems than example (2) when the hearer knows
that the speaker lives in the city centre.

2.2 Presupposition and Agents’ Cognitive
States
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999446">
To define pragmatic presupposition within DRT,
presupposition should be understood to be a prop-
erty of the agent. Lambrecht (1994) understands
pragmatic presupposition as an interest in the as-
sumptions speakers make about hearers. There are
two types of agent presupposition, speaker pre-
supposition and hearer presupposition. This is
different from semantic presupposition, i.e. sen-
tence presupposition. Agent presupposition dif-
fers from sentence presupposition in that the latter
stems from sentence meaning, whereas the former
attaches itself to the beliefs of the speaker and her
intentions.
In essence, the effect of presupposition is to give
insights about the speaker’s beliefs as well as the
speaker’s beliefs about the hearer’s beliefs. In this
sense, the dynamic semantic notion of ‘taken for
granted’ means that the speaker believes the pre-
supposition to be either known information or in-
formation that is not the desired focus of atten-
tion. When a speaker introduces a presupposition
in her utterance, she is not primarily concerned
with the information the presupposition provides,
but rather in the new information, the ‘assertion’
part, the utterance communicates.
Presupposition is related to the beliefs of the
speaker. Speaker belief leads to presupposi-
tion, which indicates the beliefs of the speaker to
the hearer. Presupposition is a reflection of the
speaker’s state of mind. What speakers presup-
pose gives an indication as to what speakers be-
lieve or accept (weakly believe) and what they be-
lieve hearers believe or accept within the context
of a dialogue (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). This is stronger
than what is generally conceded in the relevant lit-
erature (Geurts 1999).
While this view of pragmatic presupposition
shares Stalnaker’s (2002) view concerning the im-
portance of beliefs and context to understanding
linguistic phenomena, the present view of presup-
position has a different understanding of the rela-
tionship between belief and presupposition. Stal-
naker sees beliefs, not in terms of the speaker, but
rather in terms of the vague term the ‘common
ground’ (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). ‘[T]o believe p to
be common ground is to presuppose in Stalnaker’s
sense’ as Simons (2003: 19) puts it. The view pre-
sented here takes the position that presuppositions
reflect the speaker’s beliefs, regardless of whether
the beliefs are part of common ground or not.

3 Pragmatic Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999441947368421">
Having defined what is meant by pragmatic pre-
supposition, we now move to discuss introducing
pragmatic constraints on the phenomenon of pre-
supposition in DRT. In order to enhance the prag-
matic representation of presuppositional phenom-
enon in DRT, Gricean maxims need to be formu-
lated in terms of pragmatic constraints on gener-
ating presuppositional utterances (speaker’s per-
spective) and interpreting them (hearer’s perspec-
tive). The maxims are reformulated in terms of
the cognitive relationship between the speaker and
the hearer, producing constraints on presupposi-
tion which are necessary for successful communi-
cation.
Following Grice’s Cooperative Principle (Grice
1989), by adhering to the maxims, dialogue agents
are being cooperative and not attempting to de-
ceive or lie to one another (Grice 1989). The inten-
tion to communicate requires the speaker to assess
her beliefs concerning the hearer’s beliefs. This
way of thinking about dialogue communication
leads to the formulation of pragmatic constraints.
It is proposed that these constraints broadly cor-
respond to Grice’s quantity and quality maxims.
Section 4 describes an implementation of the prag-
matic constraints introduced in this section.
To make her contribution informative (maxim
of quantity), the speaker needs to follow the first
pragmatic constraint placed on making an asser-
tion (BCA1): to express an assertion the speaker
needs to believe that the hearer does not hold the
assertion, A, as a belief. In other words, the
speaker believes the hearer does not hold the belief
that A. This is similar to van der Sandt’s (1992)
informativity constraint, although his informativ-
ity constraint is not directly linked to beliefs. This
pragmatic constraint is illustrated in the following
example:

Hearer: Yeah I know.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.750336">
In example (3) the hearer indicates previous
knowledge of A, which means that either the
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998256882352941">
speaker is not following BCA1, or that the speaker
was not aware that the hearer believes A. With
each new utterance, the speaker must be aware of
the BCA1.
The second pragmatic constraint placed on as-
sertion is BCA2. Following from our assumptions
concerning Grice’s quality maxim, for a speaker
to express an assertion, the speaker must herself
believe or accept that assertion. That is to say, be-
ing cooperative, to express A, the speaker must be-
lieve or accept that A.
Similarly, to introduce a presupposition, the
speaker must include the presupposition in her
beliefs or acceptance space (quality maxim),
(BCP1). If the speaker is initiating a topic, the
hearer has more grounds to conclude the speaker
believes P (BCP1a). At the same time, the speaker
must also be aware that when introducing P, the
speaker is communicating that the speaker be-
lieves P. That is to say, if the speaker initiates the
topic of P, the hearer may assume that the speaker
believes P. However, when it is the hearer’s turn to
become the speaker, and he refers to the presup-
position, P, introduced by the speaker, the speaker,
who introduced P, may assume a weaker belief on
the part of the hearer, namely that the hearer ac-
cepts P. Thus, presuppositions are built on the cur-
rent context, which is built upon the union of be-
liefs and acceptance spaces of an agent. In other
words, if the hearer refers to a presupposition em-
ployed previously by the speaker, the hearer (who
now becomes the speaker) at least accepts P (i.e.
holds P in his acceptance space) (BCP2).
For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.610178">

<bodyText confidence="0.965849462686568">
present.
H1: I didn’t know Vincent was married.
S2: Yes, he is. His wife likes chocolate.
H2: She may also like flowers.
S3: I’ll buy her chocolates.
The speaker initiates the presupposition (in exam-
ple (4) it is new information to the hearer) that Vin-
cent has a wife. According to BCP1, the hearer
may safely assume and indeed add to his beliefs
about the speaker’s beliefs that the speaker be-
lieves P (Vincent has a wife). However, when the
hearer comes to refer to P (Vincent’s wife), the
speaker does not necessarily infer that the hearer
believes Vincent is married, but rather that the
hearer accepts P. Introducing a topic for the pre-
supposition allows the hearer to add more strength
to her representation of the speaker’s beliefs, i.e.
to establish belief rather than acceptance. This
would be more evident in a context where the
speaker is attempting to persuade the hearer to do
something. For information dialogues, where the
information provider has the authority of possess-
ing the answers to the information seeker’s ques-
tions, the beliefs of the information provider may
attain a stronger position than they would in other
types of social contexts (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). The
information seeker is less likely to challenge or
evaluate the strength of belief of the information
provider. If we contrast example (4) with example
(5), the strength of beliefs are much higher, we can
assume, than for when the hearer is not required to
perform any action.
(5) S1: You should buy Vincent’s wife a
birthday present.
H1: I didn’t know Vincent was married.
S2: Yes he is. His wife likes chocolate.
H2: She may also like flowers.
S3: But she prefers chocolate.
H3: I’ll get her some chocolate.
In example (4), where the hearer was not re-
quired to perform any action, it is safer for the
speaker to assume that the hearer accepts P as the
hearer is not committing himself to doing any task,
than to assume the stronger case, i.e. the hearer
believes P. However, in example (5) where the
hearer agrees to buying Vincent’s wife a present in
H3 (that is the hearer commits to perform an ac-
tion for Vincent’s wife), the speaker will conclude
that the hearer believes the presupposed proposi-
tion and adds this to the speaker’s representation
of the hearer’s beliefs. In other words, when the
hearer makes P, in H3, the speaker concludes that
the hearer believes P and adds this to the speaker’s
representation, or beliefs set, of the hearer’s be-
liefs. Thus, someone getting someone else’s com-
mitment to do something implies greater strength
of belief about a presupposition which affects that
commitment.
Allowing the hearer to assume weaker belief
brings us back to Simons’ (2003) suggestion of
modifying Stalnaker’s understanding of presuppo-
sition to become what she terms the ‘disposition
of presupposition’: speakers ‘act as if’ they take
the presupposition for granted. Simons (2003) ar-
gues that speakers do not need to believe the pre-
suppositions they use. With acceptance, as un-
derstood by the view of pragmatic presupposition

presented in this paper, speakers do not have to
hold the strong belief P. But, at the same time,
to express P, speakers should not hold the belief
that P is false. That is, being cooperative neces-
sitates that when the speaker utters P, the speaker
does not hold the belief that -, P. Speakers may
indicate stronger belief. However, if there is no
such indication (e.g. ‘Definitely’, or ‘I couldn’t
agree more’), hearers may conclude that speakers
at least hold the presupposition in their acceptance
space. Speakers may later allow the hearer to con-
clude that they hold greater strength of belief than
at first assumed.

The following set of operations implement the

BCP1, and BCP2.2 We begin, firstly, by show-
ing how the pragmatic constraint operations are
implemented and by demonstrating how the code
works on linear DRSs (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). Sec-
ondly, we demonstrate how the constraints work
on a real example by passing an example dialogue

The first pragmatic constraint on assertion (BCA1)
is represented by beliefConstraintA1. It checks
that a condition is not in the hearer’s Belief DRS
nor inside the hearer’s Acceptance DRS in a
Speaker’s Belief or Acceptance DRS. Agent’s Be-
lief DRSs represent stronger beliefs they hold and
stronger beliefs they have about other agents in di-
alogue, whereas Acceptance DRSs represent their
weaker beliefs about the dialogue and about the
weaker beliefs held by other agents in dialogue (cf.
Al-Raheb 2005). When a condition is not found in
either embedded DRS, it succeeds.
The second pragmatic constraint on assertion
(BCA2) is represented by beliefConstraintA2,
which checks if a condition is either in the
speaker’s Belief or Acceptance DRS. The oper-
ation succeeds once a match is found.3 BCP1

‘singer(X)’, is a member of the speaker’s belief or

a condition, e.g. ‘singer(X)’, is a member of the
speaker’s belief or acceptance DRS (embedded in-

tance or belief DRSs. It then adds the condition to
the hearer’s acceptance DRS, as in Figure 4.

is passed through the implemented pragmatic con-
straints to briefly demonstrate how the pragmatic
constraints can be employed in dialogue. Figures 5
and 6 show the initial beliefs of both agents before
the dialogue is initiated. To proceed, the pragmatic
constraints for the speaker are applied. If the prag-

go forward. This starts a recognition process on
the part of the hearer.

The same reasoning applies to checking whether

This paper has introduced a pragmatic view of pre-
supposition both in terms of givenness and the ef-
fects agents’ cognitive states have on formulating
presupposition. To introduce this pragmatic view
of presupposition into DRT, some pragmatic con-
straints have been formulated and demonstrated by
way of example. In addition, an implementation of
these pragmatic constraints on presupposition has
been introduced into the extended DRT represen-
tation formulated by Al-Raheb (2005).

Presupposition is related to the beliefs of the speaker. Speaker belief leads to presupposition, which indicates the beliefs of the speaker to the hearer. Presupposition is a reflection of the speaker’s state of mind. What speakers presuppose gives an indication as to what speakers believe or accept (weakly believe) and what they believe hearers believe or accept within the context of a dialogue (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). This is stronger than what is generally conceded in the relevant literature (Geurts 1999). While this view of pragmatic presupposition shares Stalnaker’s (2002) view concerning the importance of beliefs and context to understanding linguistic phenomena, the present view of presupposition has a different understanding of the relationship between belief and presupposition. Stalnaker sees beliefs, not in terms of the speaker, but rather in terms of the vague term the ‘common ground’ (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). ‘[T]o believe p to be common ground is to presuppose in Stalnaker’s sense’ as Simons (2003: </context>

Introducing a topic for the presupposition allows the hearer to add more strength to her representation of the speaker’s beliefs, i.e. to establish belief rather than acceptance. This would be more evident in a context where the speaker is attempting to persuade the hearer to do something. For information dialogues, where the information provider has the authority of possessing the answers to the information seeker’s questions, the beliefs of the information provider may attain a stronger position than they would in other types of social contexts (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). The information seeker is less likely to challenge or evaluate the strength of belief of the information provider. If we contrast example (4) with example (5), the strength of beliefs are much higher, we can assume, than for when the hearer is not required to perform any action. (5) S1: You should buy Vincent’s wife a birthday present. H1: I didn’t know Vincent was married. S2: Yes he is. His wife likes chocolate. H2: She may also like flowers. S3: But she prefers chocolate.

Speakers may later allow the hearer to conclude that they hold greater strength of belief than at first assumed. 4 Implementing Pragmatic Constraints The following set of operations implement the pragmatic constraints on presupposition and assertion set out in section 3, namely BCA1, BCA2, BCP1, and BCP2.2 We begin, firstly, by showing how the pragmatic constraint operations are implemented and by demonstrating how the code works on linear DRSs (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). Secondly, we demonstrate how the constraints work on a real example by passing an example dialogue through the implemented pragmatic constraints for both the speaker and the hearer. 4.1 Implementation The first pragmatic constraint on assertion (BCA1) is represented by beliefConstraintA1. It checks that a condition is not in the hearer’s Belief DRS nor inside the hearer’s Acceptance DRS in a Speaker’s Belief or Acceptance DRS. Agent’s Belief DRSs represent stronger beliefs they hold and stronger beliefs they have about other agents in dialogue, whereas Acceptance DRSs represent their weaker </context>

Indeed, Simons concludes that DRT is a theory of semantic and not pragmatic presupposition (2003). The criticism that DRT is only semantic is not wholly justified. While DRT stems from the need for appropriate semantic representation of discourse, DRT does recognize the importance of context in representing referents in discourse, which is generally taken to mark a pragmatic perspective on presupposition. Additionally, theories within DRT, such as the Binding Theory (Geurts 1999), have attempted to make DRT more pragmatic; in particular, Presupposition as Anaphora Theory’s construction process of presupposition (van der Sandt and Geurts 1991). However, while this paper aims to show that DRT is not entirely devoid of pragmatics, it argues that DRT is in need of a more pragmatic treatment of presupposition, which (a) pays more attention to the beliefs and intentions of the speaker and the hearer and their relation to presupposition and (b) makes presuppositional constraints more precise. Further, other scholars have criticized DRT for being essentially truthconditional.</context>

In order to enhance the pragmatic representation of presuppositional phenomenon in DRT, Gricean maxims need to be formulated in terms of pragmatic constraints on generating presuppositional utterances (speaker’s perspective) and interpreting them (hearer’s perspective). The maxims are reformulated in terms of the cognitive relationship between the speaker and the hearer, producing constraints on presupposition which are necessary for successful communication. Following Grice’s Cooperative Principle (Grice 1989), by adhering to the maxims, dialogue agents are being cooperative and not attempting to deceive or lie to one another (Grice 1989). The intention to communicate requires the speaker to assess her beliefs concerning the hearer’s beliefs. This way of thinking about dialogue communication leads to the formulation of pragmatic constraints. It is proposed that these constraints broadly correspond to Grice’s quantity and quality maxims. Section 4 describes an implementation of the pragmatic constraints introduced in this section. To make her contribution informative (maxim of quantity), the speaker</context>

Given these varying definitions as to what constitutes presupposition, before attempting to introduce pragmatic constraints to presupposition in DRT, we must first explain what pragmatic presupposition, as used in this paper, constitutes. Two important notions come into question when assessing what constitutes presupposition, namely, the notion of givenness and the relationship between the beliefs (or the cognitive states) of the agents involved in a conversation. 2.1 Presupposition and Givenness While presuppositions can be defined as that part of the utterance that is taken to be ‘given’ (Lambrecht 1994), the notion of ‘given’ needs clarifying. ‘Given’ means known information, information that the speaker regards as known to both speaker and hearer - information directly relating to the topic of the dialogue or as part of general background knowledge assumptions about the world. The presupposition in this sense is a reflection of the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s state of mind, i.e. the speaker assumes the hearer already knows this information (Lambrecht 1994). An alternate meaning of ‘given’ is when the speaker knows that the information the presupposition provides is, in fact, ne</context>
<context position="8500" citStr="Lambrecht (1994)" startWordPosition="1292" endWordPosition="1293">information to pass as given, the speaker must be aware that introducing an ‘out of the ordinary’ or ‘remarkable’ presupposition will cause problems. For instance, example (1) is less likely to cause problems than example (2) when the hearer knows that the speaker lives in the city centre. 26 (1) The car across the street from my house belongs to my neighbour. (2) The small jet across the street from my house belongs to my neighbour, 2.2 Presupposition and Agents’ Cognitive States To define pragmatic presupposition within DRT, presupposition should be understood to be a property of the agent. Lambrecht (1994) understands pragmatic presupposition as an interest in the assumptions speakers make about hearers. There are two types of agent presupposition, speaker presupposition and hearer presupposition. This is different from semantic presupposition, i.e. sentence presupposition. Agent presupposition differs from sentence presupposition in that the latter stems from sentence meaning, whereas the former attaches itself to the beliefs of the speaker and her intentions. In essence, the effect of presupposition is to give insights about the speaker’s beliefs as well as the speaker’s beliefs about the hea</context>

Karttunen (1973) maintains that the semantic perspective on presupposition sees presupposition as emanating from the sentence, and the pragmatic perspective as emanating from the speaker. Levinson argues that presupposition cannot be viewed as semantic in the narrow sense (based on formal logic and truth conditionality), but rather as dependent on context and ‘the actual linguistic structure of sentences’ (Levinson 1983: 167). Theories defining presupposition within pragmatics depend mainly on mutual knowledge (or common ground). Within computational linguistics the treatment of presupposition falls mainly within dynamic semantics, within which DRT has developed. In the broadest terms presupposition, whether in linguistics or philosophy, has been viewed as a relation between sentences or propositions, where the presupposed proposition is not in focus in the presupposition sentence. DRT, and dynamic semantics in general, is precisely concerned with such relations – i.e. with the relations between an utterance</context>

Some of DRT’s principal concerns are with finding the right truth conditions and interpretation for referential expressions, specifically anaphora. This is relevant for further investigation of ‘pragmatic’ presupposition because it has in fact been proposed by van der 1I gratefully acknowledge support from Science Foundation Ireland grant 04/IN/I527. Sandt and Geurts (1991) that it is anaphora that lies at the basis of presupposition. However, Simons (2003) has recently noted some pragmatic limitations in the present state of DRT. She refers in the following quotation to ‘dynamic semantics’, the field taken to include DRT. Dynamic semantics does not attempt to understand presupposition and presuppositional constraints in terms of the speaker’s beliefs and intentions, or to root presuppositional constraints in terms of the broad goals of communicators (Simons 2003: 27). Indeed, Simons concludes that DRT is a theory of semantic and not pragmatic presupposition (2003). The criticism that DRT is only semantic is not wholly justified. While DRT stems</context>

This is stronger than what is generally conceded in the relevant literature (Geurts 1999). While this view of pragmatic presupposition shares Stalnaker’s (2002) view concerning the importance of beliefs and context to understanding linguistic phenomena, the present view of presupposition has a different understanding of the relationship between belief and presupposition. Stalnaker sees beliefs, not in terms of the speaker, but rather in terms of the vague term the ‘common ground’ (cf. Al-Raheb 2005). ‘[T]o believe p to be common ground is to presuppose in Stalnaker’s sense’ as Simons (2003: 19) puts it. The view presented here takes the position that presuppositions reflect the speaker’s beliefs, regardless of whether the beliefs are part of common ground or not. 3 Pragmatic Constraints Having defined what is meant by pragmatic presupposition, we now move to discuss introducing pragmatic constraints on the phenomenon of presupposition in DRT. In order to enhance the pragmatic representation of presuppositional phenomenon in DRT, Gricean maxims need to be formulated in terms of pragmatic constraints on generating presuppositional utterances (speaker’s perspective) and interpreti</context>

Thus, someone getting someone else’s commitment to do something implies greater strength of belief about a presupposition which affects that commitment. Allowing the hearer to assume weaker belief brings us back to Simons’ (2003) suggestion of modifying Stalnaker’s understanding of presupposition to become what she terms the ‘disposition of presupposition’: speakers ‘act as if’ they take the presupposition for granted. Simons (2003) argues that speakers do not need to believe the presuppositions they use. With acceptance, as understood by the view of pragmatic presupposition 28 presented in this paper, speakers do not have to hold the strong belief P. But, at the same time, to express P, speakers should not hold the belief that P is false. That is, being cooperative necessitates that when the speaker utters P, the speaker does not hold the belief that -, P. Speakers may indicate stronger belief. However, if there is no such indication (e.g. ‘Definitely’, or ‘I couldn’t agree more’), hearers may conclude that speakers at </context>

The presupposition in this sense is a reflection of the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s state of mind, i.e. the speaker assumes the hearer already knows this information (Lambrecht 1994). An alternate meaning of ‘given’ is when the speaker knows that the information the presupposition provides is, in fact, new to the hearer. In this case, the speaker introduces the new information ‘as if’ it were given, in order to indicate that the presupposed information is not the focus of the speaker’s attention. Unlike Stalnaker’s understanding of presupposition (Stalnaker 2002), this understanding of ‘given’ to include information new to the hearer means that the presupposition introduced is not necessarily part of what is often termed the ‘common ground’. Thus, we might think in terms of a speaker ‘packaging’ information as a presupposition (speaker presupposition). In this approach, the speaker has the choice of picking information she deems to be known to the hearer or information that she deems to be new to the hearer, knowing that to do so, she (the speaker) is communicating that the presupposition is not the focus of her utterance, but rather she would like th</context>

Werth, for example, claims that DRT is essentially only about truthconditionality: 25 Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Constraints and Language Processing (CSLP-06), pages 25–32, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics [DRT’s] goal is truth-conditionality and its models are minimal worlds inhabited by predicates and variables... it does not model human understanding: there is no place in it for participant roles, setting, background knowledge, purposes, even inferences (Werth 1999: 65). Again, this criticism is not entirely just. To address the aforementioned pragmatic limitations of DRT, the aim of this paper is to address the problem of insightfully capturing pragmatic constraints on presuppositional phenomenon within the framework of DRT. To achieve this, a pragmaticallyconstrained definition of presupposition is attempted. This is followed by setting some pragmatic constraints on agents’ conception of presuppositional phrases based on the agents’ roles in conversation. An example of how these pragmatic constraints operate in DRT is then examined. Furthermore, an ov</context>
