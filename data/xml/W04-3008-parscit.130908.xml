<bodyText confidence="0.999979692307692">
There is a manifest chasm between research and industry in the field of spoken language understanding.
The research community underwent a massive effort to define, evaluate and improve the notion of language
understanding for speech applications in the ATIS program, which ended in the mid 1990s. On the other
side of the chasm there is industry, which started in the mid 1990s building commercial applications based
on very simplified forms of language understanding, and evolved towards an industrial standard adopted
by most vendors today. In the past couple of years we witnessed an evolution of the commecially deployed
systems with an attempt at deploying statistical classification of utterances, which is still a very simple form
of understanding. In the meantime, where has research on spoken language understanding gone? Is it a much
too difficult problem? Is it considered a solved problem? Is it too application specific? Does industry really
need natural spoken language understanding? How could industry benefit from research? While we are not
able to give definite answers to some or all of these questions, we can perhaps try to read the current trends
in the technology of language understanding , and see which unanswered questions the research community
should try to address.
