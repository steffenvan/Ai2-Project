This volume contains the papers prepared for and presented at the Workshop on Sentiment and
Subjectivity in Text, held on 22 July 2006 in Sydney, Australia, immediately following COLING/ACL
2006.
Sentiment and subjectivity in text constitute a problem that is orthogonal to typical topic detection tasks in
text classification. Despite the lack of a precise definition of sentiment or subjectivity, headway has been
made in matching human judgments by automatic means. Such systems can prove useful in a variety of
contexts. In many applications it is important to distinguish what an author is talking about from his or
her subjective stance towards the topic. If the writing is highly subjective, as for example in an editorial
text or comment, the text should be treated differently than if it were a mostly objective presentation of
facts, as for example in a news article. Information extraction, summarization, and question answering
can benefit from an accurate separation of subjective content from objective content. Furthermore, the
particular sentiment expressed by an author towards a topic is important for “opinion mining”, i.e. the
extraction of prevalent opinions about topics or items from a collection of texts. Similarly, in business
intelligence it is important to automatically extract positive and negative perceptions about features of a
product or service.
Over the past several years, there has been an increasing number of publications focused on the detection
and classification of sentiment and subjectivity in text. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together
researchers interested in the topic to share and discuss recent work in the area. The quality and diversity
of submissions we received confirmed our belief that this area is and will continue to be a fascinating
and fruitful one for some time to come.
We wish to thank all of the authors for submitting papers for consideration, and all of the members of the
program committee for their careful and prompt attention to the review process. We also wish to thank
our invited speakers, Bing Liu, Nicolas Nicolov, and Franco Salvetti.
