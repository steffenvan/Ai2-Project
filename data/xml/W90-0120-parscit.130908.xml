ABSTRACT. Natural language generation needs an in-
put language whose expressive power is sufficient for
generating texts with the level of quality desired by var-
ious NLP applications. In our generator, DIOGENES(e.g.,
Nirenburg et al., 1989), we use the text meaning repre-
sentation language TAMERLAN(Nirenburg and Defrise,
1989 and forthcoming). Expressions in this language
are used as input by the DIOGENFS text planner to pro-
duce text plan expressions in the text plan language,
TPL, that in their turn serve as input to syntactic realiza-
tion. In this paper we describe the treatment of one of
the several types of knowledge encoded in TAMERLAN,
namely, speaker attitudes. We also illustrate how these
input components are used in producing text plans.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928">
Our reasons for introducing attitudes as an explicit part of the
representation of the meaning of a natural language clause
are manifold. In what follows we will review three (partially
interconnected) reasons. Representing attitudes a) helps rea-
soning about speaker goals, b) highlights the argumentative
structure of a discourse and c) provides a convenient vehicle
for representing modal meanings, including negation.
Almost all spoken and written discourse involves the par-
ticipants&apos; opinions, so much so that producing a perfectly
&apos;objective&apos; text is an almost impossible task. Within the set
of possible goals relating to generating text, the introduction
(explicit or implicit, lexicalized or not) of the producer&apos;s
opinions and points of view serves two goals:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8608825">
• modifying the consumer&apos;s model of the producer by
stating facts (including opinions) about self which are
not in principle observable by the consumer
• modifying the consumer&apos;s opinions by stating pro-
ducer&apos;s opinions about facts of the world (the latter
can in principle be observed by the consumer)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999560034482759">
The above distinctions only become visible if one decides
to represent attitudes overtly. Once this decision is made, it
becomes clear that it brings about better description possibil-
ities for additional linguistic phenomena, such as the argu-
mentative structure of discourse. It has been observed (e.g.,
Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983) that texts have a well-defined
argumentative structure which reflects the producer&apos;s cur-
rent goals and influences such processes as the ordering of
text components and lexical selection in generation. The
argumentative structure of a text is realized (or, in text un-
derstanding, detected) through linguistic means such as the
use of scalar adverbs (&apos; only&apos;, &apos;even&apos;, &apos;almost&apos;, &apos;hardly&apos;, etc.),
connectives (&apos;but&apos;, since&apos;), adjectives (&apos;unbearable&apos;, &apos;fasci-
nating&apos;, etc.). Sets of such lexical items may have to be
considered equivalent from a purely semantic point of view,
but different in a facet of their pragmatic effect known as
argumentative orientation. For example, to illustrate the in-
terplay between semantic content and argumentative orienta-
tion (i.e. the producer&apos;s attitude towards an event), contrast
(1) and (2), which have opposite truth conditions, but the
same pragmatic value — from both (1) and (2) the consumer
will infer that the producer regards Burma as an inefficient
sleuth. In this example it is sufficient to retain pragmatic
information concerning the producer&apos;s judgment of Burma
while the semantic differences (induced by the use of &amp;quot;few&amp;quot;
versus &amp;quot;none at all&amp;quot;) can be disregarded. However, in other
contexts the semantics will matter much more — consider,
for instance, (3) for which there can be no paraphrase with
&amp;quot;no clues at all.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992635333333333">
(1) Nestor Burma found few clues. Nobody was
surprised.
(2) Nestor Burma found no clues at all. Nobody
was surprised.
(3) Nestor Burma found few clues. But it was
still better than having none at all.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.959548666666667">
The difference between (4) and (5), whose truth conditions
are similar, is purely argumentative (or attidudinal) — (4)
expresses a positive (optimistic!) attitude, (5) the opposite
point of view. This example shows how crucial the extraction
of the argumentative structure is, since it is the only clue for
the inacceptability of (6).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9034286">

(5) Nestor has little money.
(6) ?Nestor has little money. He wouldn&apos;t mind
spending some on chocolate.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992049">
Finally, we use the attitude markers as a means of ex-
pressing modality. Traditionally, formal semanticists have
extended first order logic to modal logic in order to account
for modals. This places the modals at a purely semantic level,
and does not allow for a distinction between what is observ-
able for both producer and consumer, and what is not such
as opinions, beliefs, etc. We consider that expressions like
&apos;perhaps,&apos; possibly,&amp;quot;it is almost certain that&apos; are clues as to
what the producer&apos;s beliefs and attitudes are towards facts of
the world and help the consumer modify or update his model
of the producer. It is for the above reasons that we decided
to include a detailed specification of producer attitudes into
the input specification for generation.

In somewhat greater detail, the definition of the fragment
of TAMERLAN dealing with attitudes is as follows.

TAMERLAN is a frame-based representation language for rep-
resenting text meanings. In our approach, treatment of mean-
ing is agent-centered, that is, all the processes of (and the
knowledge used for) understanding, representation and real-
ization of meaning are described with respect to the model
of an intelligent agent. This agent includes a model of the
world, a model of language and a model of language un-
derstanding and generation.&apos;. The world model includes
knowledge (beliefs) about other agents in the world, includ-
ing interlocutors. In understanding language communication
(text or dialog), an intelligent agent extracts and represents
a) text meaning; b) the active set of producer (speaker, au-
thor) goals and plans that led to the production of this text
and c) a set of active parameters of the speech situation,
including spatiotemporal characteristics, knowledge about
participants and a set of pragmatic factors similar to Hovy&apos;s
(1988) rhetorical goals. These three items form what we call
the supermeaning of a text.

To represent text meaning proper, TAMERLAN uses the
following basic entity types: clause, relation and attitude.
TAMERLAN clauses delimit the propositional and pragmatic
content of target language utterances. Relations represent
links among events, objects, or textual objects (e.g., sen-
tences, paragraphs, etc.). A definition and detailed descrip-
tion of TAMERLAN is given in Nirenburg and Defrise (forth-
coming).
Attitudes are represented in TAMERLAN as a quintuple

<equation confidence="0.657044">
attitudes = types,values,altributed — tos,scopes,times,

where type; is the type of the attitude; value; is the value
of the attitude, represented as a point or an interval on a

The taxonomy of attitude types is an enhancement of Re-
ichman&apos;s treatment of &amp;quot;context spaces&amp;quot; (1985: 56). We use
the terminology (if not exactly the spirit) of her distinction
among the epistemic, evaluative and deontic issue-type con-
text spaces. Context space is Reichman&apos;s term for a discourse
segment. The issue context space corresponds to our atti-
tude component, while the non-issue context space provides
a shallow taxonomy for discourse segment types (Reichman
defines comment, narrative support, and nonnarrative sup-
port as the non-issue type values). It will be discussed and

illustrated in the next section.
Ontological types are concepts in the intelligent agent&apos;s
ontology and domain model. The organization of the ontol-
ogy used in the DIOGENES project see, e.g., in Nirenburg and
Levin (1989). Instances of ontological types are actual mean-
ings, including those comprising a TAMERLAN text. Some
instances are &amp;quot;remembered instances&amp;quot; (e.g., John Kennedy,
The Washington Post etc.) and are stored in the agent&apos;s
episodic memory. The absolute time at (or since or until)
which an attitude has been held is shown, for instance, as
05-12-90-13:45:11.56. Relative (or unknown) times are lo-
cally represented as variables and treated with the help of
temporal relations in TAMEIUAN.
The attributed-to component of the attitude simply binds
the attitude to a particular cognitive agent (which may be the
producer of the utterance or some other known or unknown
agent), who endorses the responsibility of the content of
the utterance. This is important for understanding reported
speech, and more generally the polyphony phenomena, in
the sense of Ducrot (1984). Ducrot&apos;s theory of polyphony,
an approach to extended reported speech treatment, provides
a framework for dealing with the interpretation of a number
of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, e.g. the difference
in meaning and use between &apos;since&apos; and &apos;because&apos;, certain
particularities of negative sentences, etc.
The scope of the attitude representation pinpoints the entity
to which this attitude is expressed. The values of the scope
can be an entire clause, a part of it or even another attitude
value, with its scope. In understanding the text the text con-
sumer notes the attitudes of the producer toward the content.
The attitudes can be expressed toward events (7), objects (8),
properties (9) or other attitudes (10).

<bodyText confidence="0.996525111111111">
McKeown and Elhadad (1989) also treat argumentative
scales and attitudinals in a generation environment. They,
however, consider these phenomena as part of syntax, thus
avoiding the need to add a special pragmatic component to
their system. This decision is appropriate from the point
of view of minimizing the changes in an existing generator
due to the inclusion of attitude information. However, if
compatibility were not an issue, we believe that introducing
a separate component is a more appropriate choice.

The following example illustrates lexical realizations of the
epistemic attitude (grouped by approximate attitude-value).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5913256">

doubt that Paul left. It is true that Paul left.
0.9 Paul must have left. Most probably, Paul left.

<table confidence="0.4301178">
0.6 It is possible that Paul left. I would think Paul left.
Chances are Paul left.
0.5 I don&apos;t know whether Paul left (or not).
0.3 It is unlikely that Paul left. I doubt whether Paul left.
0 Paul didn&apos;t leave. It is impossible for Paul to have left.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.968340916666666">
I don&apos;t know that Paul left. I don&apos;t believe (at all) that
Paul left. It is not true that Paul left. I know that Paul
didn&apos;t leave. I believe (without a doubt) that Paul didn&apos;t
leave.
In our representation we do not distinguish what is from
what the agent knows, believes or is certain about. &amp;quot;Ob-
jective&amp;quot; reality, thus, doesn&apos;t exist in the system. Facts and
events belong to the &amp;quot;projected reality&amp;quot; (Jackendoff&apos;s term),
i.e., reality as perceived by an intelligent agent. The fact that
something is or is not, happened or did not happen, bears the
mark of the agent&apos;s perception. Hence the epistemic attitude.
Degrees of knowledge are identified with degrees of belief
and degrees of certainty. If an agent knows something, he
is certain about it and believes it. &amp;quot;Paul left&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;I (the text
producer) believe that Paul left&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;I know that Paul left.&amp;quot;
Similarly, we feel that if someone says &amp;quot;Paul didn&apos;t leave,&amp;quot;
it really means (to the text consumer who interprets it) &amp;quot;The
producer doesn&apos;t believe at all that Paul left&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;The producer
doesn&apos;t know that Paul left&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;It is impossible for Paul to
have left&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;The producer doesn&apos;t believe that Paul left&amp;quot; =
&amp;quot;It&apos;s not true that Paul left.&amp;quot; Negation can be understood as
an attitude towards the event &amp;quot;Paul left.&amp;quot; Hence our decision
to collapse the parity of sentence with the epistemic attitudes
of the agent. Seeing negation as the realization of an agent&apos;s
attitude has further advantages. Some uses of negation (the
&amp;quot;polemic&amp;quot; use, in denials) as in the following dialog:
A: Paul came to the party yesterday.
B: He didn&apos;t come. &lt;I saw him downtown with
his girlfriend. At the time of the party, he was
&gt;
demand an analysis that take into account more than parity,
contrasting explicitly different agent&apos;s attitudes towards the
same event (this is similar to Ducrot&apos;s (1983) &amp;quot;polyphony&amp;quot;).
we can provide a good representation of the above dialog
using the &amp;quot;attributed-to&amp;quot; slot of an epistemic attitude frame.
This representation will include the representation of the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.93933">
meaning of the clause &amp;quot;Paul came to the party yesterday&amp;quot; in
a TAMERLAN clause, say, clause_1, and two epistemic attitude
frames, as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8242732">
(attitude _l
(type epistemic)
(value 1)
(attributed-to A)
(scope clause 1))
(attitude_2
(type epistemic)
(value 0)
(attributed-to B)
(scope clause_1))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994145">
In generating spoken text, the fact that the representation
contains opposite epistemic attitudes with similar scopes will
be realized through marked intonation. In contrast, a text fea-
turing a simple negation (not a denial of a previous assertion,
but a simple negative assertion) will not be represented using
two opposite-value epistemic attitudes with similar scope.
Furthermore, representing parity as an attitude gives rise to
&amp;quot;formulas&amp;quot; that elegantly translate certain semantic relations
between sentences. For instance the synonymy of the natural
language sentences &amp;quot;The book is not interesting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The
book is uninteresting&amp;quot; is translated in terms of attitudes as
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.647442142857143">
(attitude_3
(type epistemic)
(value 0)
(attributed-to A)

and
(attitude _5
(type epistemic)
(value 1)

(type evaluative)

respectively (clause_2 represents the meaning glossed as
&amp;quot;this book,&amp;quot; because the entire sentences only express the
attitude toward the book). Therefore,
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.982734583333333">
(epistemic 0 (evaluative 1)) = (epistemic 1 (evaluative 0))
The equality will be valid only if the &amp;quot;attributed-to&amp;quot; slots of
the relevant attitudes have the same fillers. The above means
that negation is generally understood as having a &amp;quot;lowering
effect&amp;quot; — something not interesting is less than interesting.
When the condition about the &amp;quot;attributed-to&amp;quot; fillers is not
fulfilled, negation must be understood as polemical, and in
this case the meaning of &amp;quot;the book is not interesting&amp;quot; could,
in fact, be as in &amp;quot;the book is not interesting; it is fascinating.&amp;quot;
(Once again, in speech a marked intonation will be used.)
The realization of the deontic attitude can be illustrated as
follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.290880357142857">
1 I must go. I have to go
0.8-0.2 I ought to go. I&apos;d better go. I should go. You may
go.
0 I needn&apos;t go.
Some illustrations of the realization of the volition attitude:
1 I wish ... I want to... I I will gladly...
0.8-0.2 I hesitate to... It may be a good idea to... I&apos;m
reluctant to...
0 I&apos;m unwilling to... I refuse to... I don&apos;t want...
Some lexical realizations of the expectation attitude:
1 Not surprisingly... As expected... Of course...
Needless to say...
0.8-0.2 Even (as in &amp;quot;Even Paul left&amp;quot;)
0 Surprisingly... It couldn&apos;t be expected...
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.994987045454545">
The last two attitudes, evaluative and saliency can have
in their scope not only clauses, relations or attitudes like the
previous ones, but also objects and properties.2 It is therefore
difficult to give a limited and exhaustive set of examples of
realizations.
The evaluative scale goes, like the others, from 1 to 0.
The endpoints are interpreted as roughly &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;very
good&amp;quot;) and &amp;quot;the worst&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;very bad&amp;quot;). Depending on the
scope, realizations will greatly vary and will include no lex-
ical realization at all. If the scope is an event, adverbs like
fortunately and unfortunately will be used. If the scope is the
physical appearance of a person, theendpoints of the scale of
evaluative attitude will be realized as &amp;quot;attractive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ugly,&amp;quot;
etc.
The saliency attitude plays an important role in selecting
the syntactic structure of the target sentences and in the lexi-
cal selection. Thus, it will influence the order of elements in a
he evaluative attitude to &amp;quot;the book&amp;quot; in the example above
would, in fact, belong to this latter class. Its scope is a clause
only because there is no predication in the sentence other than the
attitudinal one. In a sentence like &amp;quot;John read an interesting book&amp;quot;
the attitude is clearly toward an object instance.

3. Text Plan Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846352941177">
In a nutshell, the flow of data in DIOGENES can be described
as follows. The first processing component in DIOGENES
is its text planner which, taking into account the input &amp;quot;su-
permeaning&amp;quot; produces a text plan, a structure containing
information about the order and boundaries of target lan-
guage sentences; the decisions of reference realization and
lexical selection (for both open and most closed-class lexi-
cal items). At the next stage, a set of semantics-to-syntax
mapping rules are used to produce a set of target-language
syntactic structures (we are using the f-structures of LFG
— see, e.g., Nirenburg and Levin, 1989). Finally, a syntac-
tic realizer produces a target language text from the set of
f-structures.
The text plan language we use in DIOGENES includes the
following types of constructs — the plan-sentence, the plan-
clause, two kinds of plan-roles and the plan modifier. The
frames for these constructs are as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.942857787878788">

<bodyText confidence="0.997845">
Types of plan sentences at present include simple,
compound-conjunctive and compound-disjunctive. The
realization property has 3 possible values - lexical,
ellpisis and pro. topic is used to mark the topical-
ized/focused elements in the clause; this property is also
used to specify that the clause will be active or passive and
whether it will feature an active or passive cleft construction.
modifiers is a slot in which all the modifiers of a given
plan concept are listed.
The text planner will to determine which of the thematic
roles in the input are to be realized as arguments and which,
as modifiers.

Text planning rules in DIOGENES deal with a variety of phe-
nomena. Some are devoted to text structure proper — the
number and order of sentences and clauses to express the
meanings of input; clause dependency structures, etc. Oth-
ers deal with treatment of reference — pronominalization,
ellipsis, etc. Still others take care of lexical selection, deter-
mine tense and mood features of the target text, etc. In this
section we illustrate text planning rules devoted to realization
of attitudes.

Attitudes get realized either lexically, through the inclu-

sample rules, the if clauses check the values in TAMERIAN
and, depending on the actual match, either add features to
the text plan or add a lexical realization for the attitudinal
meaning (as in Rule A4).

In the DIOGENES project we adopt the methodological attitude
of developing the generator functionalities in a breadth-first
fashion. That is to say that, unlike many other projects,
we do not tend to describe exhaustively a specific linguis-
tic phenomenon (e.g., negation, anaphora, aspect, scope of
quantifiers) or type of processing (e.g., text planning, lexical
selection, syntactic realization) before proceeding to the next
one (this approach can be considered depth-first). We prefer
to go for a complete functioning system which contains all
(or, in practice, most) of the above components and covers
all (or most) of the above phenomena. It is clear that, at the
beginning, the treatment of each (or most) of these compo-
nents is incomplete, and not every phenomenon is described
in sufficient detail. However, this methodology allows us to
benefit from a complete experimentation environment and
an open-ended architecture that facilitates the addition of
knowledge to the system and its testing and debugging. At
present we have a working prototype text planning and gen-
eration system with narrow coverage. Our current work is
devoted to expanding the knowledge needed for achieving a
deeper level of analysis of each of the linguistic phenomena
covered in the system.

<abstract confidence="0.999046071428571">Natural language generation needs an input language whose expressive power is sufficient for generating texts with the level of quality desired by var- NLP applications. In our generator, Nirenburg et al., 1989), we use the text meaning reprelanguage Defrise, and in this language used as input by the planner to produce text plan expressions in the text plan language, TPL, that in their turn serve as input to syntactic realization. In this paper we describe the treatment of one of several types of knowledge encoded in namely, speaker attitudes. We also illustrate how these input components are used in producing text plans.</abstract>

The attributed-to component of the attitude simply binds the attitude to a particular cognitive agent (which may be the producer of the utterance or some other known or unknown agent), who endorses the responsibility of the content of the utterance. This is important for understanding reported speech, and more generally the polyphony phenomena, in the sense of Ducrot (1984). Ducrot&apos;s theory of polyphony, an approach to extended reported speech treatment, provides a framework for dealing with the interpretation of a number of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, e.g. the difference in meaning and use between &apos;since&apos; and &apos;because&apos;, certain particularities of negative sentences, etc. The scope of the attitude representation pinpoints the entity to which this attitude is expressed.

The values of the scope can be an entire clause, a part of it or even another attitude value, with its scope. In understanding the text the text consumer notes the attitudes of the producer toward the content. The attitudes can be expressed toward events (7), objects (8), properties (9) or other attitudes (10). (7) The train, unfortunately, left at 5 p.m. (8) This book is interesting. (9) The meeting was reprehensibly unproductive. (10) Unfortunately, I ought to leave. McKeown and Elhadad (1989) also treat argumentative scales and attitudinals in a generation environment. They, however, consider these phenomena as part of syntax, thus avoiding the need to add a special pragmatic component to their system. This decision is appropriate from the point of view of minimizing the changes in an existing generator due to the inclusion of attitude information. However, if compatibility were not an issue, we believe that introducing a separate component is a more appropriate choice. 2.

Context space is Reichman&apos;s term for a discourse segment. The issue context space corresponds to our attitude component, while the non-issue context space provides a shallow taxonomy for discourse segment types (Reichman defines comment, narrative support, and nonnarrative support as the non-issue type values). It will be discussed and 151 illustrated in the next section. Ontological types are concepts in the intelligent agent&apos;s ontology and domain model. The organization of the ontology used in the DIOGENES project see, e.g., in Nirenburg and Levin (1989). Instances of ontological types are actual meanings, including those comprising a TAMERLAN text. Some instances are &amp;quot;remembered instances&amp;quot; (e.g., John Kennedy, The Washington Post etc.) and are stored in the agent&apos;s episodic memory. The absolute time at (or since or until) which an attitude has been held is shown, for instance, as 05-12-90-13:45:11.56. Relative (or unknown) times are locally represented as variables and treated with the help of temporal relations in TAMEIUAN.

The first processing component in DIOGENES is its text planner which, taking into account the input &amp;quot;supermeaning&amp;quot; produces a text plan, a structure containing information about the order and boundaries of target language sentences; the decisions of reference realization and lexical selection (for both open and most closed-class lexical items). At the next stage, a set of semantics-to-syntax mapping rules are used to produce a set of target-language syntactic structures (we are using the f-structures of LFG — see, e.g., Nirenburg and Levin, 1989). Finally, a syntactic realizer produces a target language text from the set of f-structures. The text plan language we use in DIOGENES includes the following types of constructs — the plan-sentence, the planclause, two kinds of plan-roles and the plan modifier. The frames for these constructs are as follows: (S_# (type plan-sentence) (subtype &lt;TYPE&gt;) (clauses (&lt;C_#&gt;*)) (C # (type plan-clause) (head &lt;word-sense&gt;) (realization {ellipsis I pro I lexical}) (features &lt;feature-value›* ) (topic (passive I cleft I passive-cleft I active)) (role &lt;R_#&gt;)* (modifiers &lt;MOD_O* &lt;R_#&gt;*) (R_# (type plan-role)</context>
