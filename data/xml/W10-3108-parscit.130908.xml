<bodyText confidence="0.999955083333333">
A general characteristic of most biomed-
ical disciplines is their primarily experi-
mental character. Discoveries are obtained
through molecular biology and biochemi-
cal techniques that allow understanding of
biological processes at the molecular level.
To qualify biological events, it is of practi-
cal significance to detect specific types of
negations that can imply either that a given
event is not observed under specific con-
ditions or even the opposite, that a given
event is true by altering the bio-entities
studied (e.g. introducing specific modifi-
cations like mutations). Of special interest
is also to determine if a detected assertion
is linked to experimental support provided
by the authors. Finding experimental qual-
ifier cues and detecting experimental tech-
nique mentions is of great interest to the
biological community in general and par-
ticularly for annotation databases. A short
overview of different types of negations
and biological qualifiers of practical rele-
vance will be provided.

<bodyText confidence="0.999928432432432">
In line with the rapid accumulation of biological
literature and the growing number of large-scale
experiments in biomedicine, it is becoming more
important to capture essential facts contained in
the literature and storing them in form of biolog-
ical annotations. Such annotations usually con-
sist in structured database records, where biologi-
cal entities of relevance, like genes or proteins are
associated to controlled vocabularies that are use-
ful to describe the most relevant aspects of these
entities (their function, localization, processes or
pathways they participate in or implications in dis-
eases). Also specific types of relations between
bio-entities (e.g. physical or regulatory interac-
tions) are manually extracted from the literature.
For biological interpretation and to determine the
reliability of annotations it is crucial to capture
both negative annotations, whether a given rela-
tion has been studied experimentally and does not
occur, as well as to determine the experimental
method used to study the bio-entity of interest. For
instance, the value of in vitro generated results, or
those obtained by large-scale experiments have a
different significance compared to those generated
in vivo. The most relevant biological annotations
contained in databases and constructed manually
by expert curators are linked to experimental qual-
ifiers. Such experimental qualifiers can range from
simple method terms to more sophisticated ontolo-
gies or hierarchical terminologies. Experimental
qualifiers used to annotate biological entities are
for instance provided by the Proteomics Standards
Initiative Molecular Interaction (PSI-MI) ontol-
ogy, (Orchard S, Kerrien S., 2010) the Evidence
Codes of Gene Ontology (GO) (Rogers MF, Ben-
Hur A, 2010) or the Open REGulatory ANNOta-
tion (ORegAnno) database Evidence Types.

There is an increasing interest to extract from
the literature negative associations. For instance,
one of the most popular biological annotation ef-
forts, Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA), also sup-
ports the annotation of &apos;NOT&apos; relations (associa-
tion.is not) to be able to represent these types of
relations in their annotation data. In GO, such re-
lations are labeled using &apos;NOT&apos; in the qualifier
column for a particular annotation. This negation
qualifier is applied to provide an explicit note that
the bio-entity is not associated with a given GO
term. This is important when a GO term might
otherwise be expected to apply to a bio-entity, but
an experiment proves otherwise. Negative asso-

ciations are also used when a cited reference ex-
plicitly states a negation event, e.g. in the form
of: bio-entity X is not found in the location Y. In
addition to annotation efforts there are a range of
scenarios where extraction of negative events are
of practical importance, these are described in the
following subsections.

2.1 Negations and Negative Controls
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995474210526316">
A common setting in experimental biology is to
use controls to avoid alternative explanations of
results and to minimize experimental artifacts.
Negative controls corroborate that the experimen-
tal outcome is not due to some sort of unrelated ef-
fect; it serves to minimize false positives and can
serve as a background observation. The underly-
ing assumption of negative controls is that one as-
sumes in advance that the result should be nega-
tive, i.e. no significant effect should be obtained.
Such negative controls are mainly expressed in the
literature using negations. For instance in case of
protein-protein interaction experiments, a negative
control could be to demonstrate that a signal is
only obtained when the two interactor proteins are
present, and not when the label (tag-protein) alone
is given to each interactor individually. To illus-
trate this aspect consider the example sentences
provided below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999246428571429">
• Our results show that, when AGG1 is present
in the matrix, it shows a strong ability to bind
35S-labeled AGB1, whereas GST alone is not
able to bind any detectable AGB1.
• GST alone did not interact with FKHR even
in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2B, lane 5), in-
dicating the specific interaction between ER
and FKHR.
• 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated FBXO11
bound to immobilized GST-p53 (lane 3) but
not GST alone (lane 2).
• PKC bound to GST-RINCK1 (lane 2) but not
to GST alone (lane 1), revealing that PKC
binds to RINCK directly.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999020285714286">
In those example cases, GST (alone) would rep-
resent the negative control. Only in presence of the
interactor proteins a signal should be observed, if
GST alone is present the assumption is that no sig-
nal should be obtained. Negative controls are cru-
cial for interpretation of the actual experimental
outcome.

<bodyText confidence="0.999896125">
A considerable effort is being made to detect genes
and mutations in genes that have implications in
the susceptibility of complex disorders. Naturally
occurring variations in the sequence of genes, of-
ten called polymorphisms might have a deleteri-
ous, protective or no associations at all to a patho-
logic condition. Not only to capture deleterious
and protective mutations, but also those that do not
have any effect is important to aid in the interpre-
tation of mutations observed in patients. This is
especially true taking into account the increasing
use of molecular screening technologies and per-
sonalized medicine in the clinical domain. Exam-
ple cases of negative associations between genes
and mutations to disease conditions derived from
PubMed abstracts can be seen below:

2.3 Toxicology and negations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998202695652174">
A simplified view of toxicology experiments is
to distinguish, given the administration of differ-
ent amounts of a specific compound or drug (e.g.
low, medium and high dosage) during predefined
time spans, between toxic and non-toxic effects.
Such effects can be examined in animal models
like rats or mini-pigs by examining a series of
aspects, such as hematological parameters, organ
histological properties (tissue alterations and size
of organs), biochemical parameters, and changes
in food/water consumption or fertility. Usually an-
imals to which specific amounts of the compound
has been administered are compared to control
cases. Here it is important to determine also three
kinds of negative associations: (1) under which
conditions a given parameter or tissue has not been
negatively affected (save dosage, non-toxic), (2)
which compound did not show the desired bene-
ficial effect (e.g. was not effective in treating the
pathologic condition) and (3) under which admin-
istration conditions a compound was not save. Ex-
ample sentences illustrating these negative associ-
ations are:

• This is an indication that the extracts may not
be completely safe in male rats when contin-
uously administered for 14days.

2.4 Experimentally altered bio-entities and
negations

In order to characterize certain biological associa-
tions, it is a common practice to alter the bio-entity
of interest, with the assumption that a given ob-
servation should change upon alteration. This is
the case of mutations or deletions experimentally
introduced to gene or protein sequences, with the
underlying assumption that the mutated or trun-
cated protein/gene should loose it ability to bind
or regulate another bio-entity, or even be non-
functional. Such mutations are useful to pin down
the actual biologically relevant functional parts of
bio-entities, which are usually of great therapeutic
importance (as target sites to inhibit certain bio-
entities or interactions). Such cases can be seen in
the example sentences provided below:

Biological annotation efforts are primarily con-

Despite the importance of experimental qualifiers,
only limited effort has been made to construct
comprehensive resources to retrieve assertions that

in the biomedical literature was one of the tasks
posed in the BioCreative challenge, a community
effort to assess text-mining tools developed for the
biomedical domain (Krallinger M, et al, 2008).
Also some systems to detect technical term men-

range of recurrent cues relevant for experimental

To qualify biological events, it is of practical significance to detect specific types of negations that can imply either that a given event is not observed under specific conditions or even the opposite, that a given event is true by altering the bio-entities studied (e.g. introducing specific modifications like mutations). Of special interest is also to determine if a detected assertion is linked to experimental support provided by the authors. Finding experimental qualifier cues and detecting experimental technique mentions is of great interest to the biological community in general and particularly for annotation databases. A short overview of different types of negations and biological qualifiers of practical relevance will be provided. 1 Biological Annotations In line with the rapid accumulation of biological literature and the growing number of large-scale experiments in biomedicine, it is becoming more important to capture essential facts contained in the literature and storing them in form of biological annotations.
