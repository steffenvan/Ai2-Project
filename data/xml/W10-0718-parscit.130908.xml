Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99997215">
One of the major bottlenecks in the develop-
ment of data-driven AI Systems is the cost of
reliable human annotations. The recent ad-
vent of several crowdsourcing platforms such
as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing re-
questers the access to affordable and rapid re-
sults of a global workforce, greatly facilitates
the creation of massive training data. Most
of the available studies on the effectiveness of
crowdsourcing report on English data. We use
Mechanical Turk annotations to train an Opin-
ion Mining System to classify Spanish con-
sumer comments. We design three different
Human Intelligence Task (HIT) strategies and
report high inter-annotator agreement between
non-experts and expert annotators. We evalu-
ate the advantages/drawbacks of each HIT de-
sign and show that, in our case, the use of
non-expert annotations is a viable and cost-
effective alternative to expert annotations.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999262777777778">
Obtaining reliable human annotations to train data-
driven AI systems is often an arduous and expensive
process. For this reason, crowdsourcing platforms
such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk1, Crowdflower2
and others have recently attracted a lot of attention
from both companies and academia. Crowdsourc-
ing enables requesters to tap from a global pool of
non-experts to obtain rapid and affordable answers
to simple Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), which

can be subsequently used to train data-driven appli-
cations.
A number of recent papers on this subject point
out that non-expert annotations, if produced in a suf-
ficient quantity, can rival and even surpass the qual-
ity of expert annotations, often at a much lower cost
(Snow et al., 2008), (Su et al., 2007). However, this
possible increase in quality depends on the task at
hand and on an adequate HIT design (Kittur et al.,
2008).
In this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of MTurk
annotations to train an Opinion Mining System to
detect opinionated contents (Polarity Detection) in
Spanish customer comments on car brands. Cur-
rently, a large majority of MTurk tasks is designed
for English speakers. One of our reasons for partic-
ipating in this shared task was to find out how easy
it is to obtain annotated data for Spanish. In addi-
tion, we want to find out how useful these data are
by comparing them to expert annotations and using
them as training data of an Opinion Mining System
for polarity detection.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 con-
tains an explanation of the task outline and our goals.
Section 3 contains a description of three different
HIT designs that we used in this task. In Section
4, we provide a detailed analysis of the retrieved
HITs and focus on geographical information of the
workers, the correlation between the different HIT
designs, the quality of the retrieved answers and on
the cost-effectiveness of the experiment. In Section
5, we evaluate the incidence of MTurk-generated an-
notations on a polarity classification task using two
different experimental settings. Finally, we conclude

3 HIT Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999254181818182">
We selected a dataset of 1000 sentences contain-
ing user opinions on cars from the automotive sec-
tion of www.ciao.es (Spanish). This website was
chosen because it contains a large and varied pool
of Spanish customer comments suitable to train an
Opinion Mining System and because opinions in-
clude simultaneously global numeric and specific
ratings over particular attributes of the subject mat-
ter. Section 5.1 contains more detailed information
about the selection of the dataset. An example of a
sentence from the data set can be found in (1):

(= ‘Don’t think twice, buy it!’)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998920545454546">
The sentences in the dataset were presented to
the MTurk workers in three different HIT designs.
Each HIT design contains a single sentence to be
evaluated. HIT1 is a simple categorization scheme
in which workers are asked to classify the sentence
as being either positive, negative or neutral, as is
shown in Figure 1b. HIT2 is a graded categorization
template in which workers had to assign a score be-
tween -5 (negative) and +5 (positive) to the example
sentence, as is shown in Figure 1c. Finally, HIT3 is
a continuous triangular scoring template that allows

workers to use both a horizontal positive-negative
axis and a vertical subjective-objective axis by plac-
ing the example sentence anywhere inside the trian-
gle. The subjective-objective axis expresses the de-
gree to which the sentence contains opinionated con-
tent and was earlier used by (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006). For example, the sentence ‘I think this is a
wonderful car’ clearly marks an opinion and should
be positioned towards the subjective end, while the
sentence ‘The car has six cilinders’ should be lo-
cated towards the objective end. Figure 1d contains
an example of HIT3. In order not to burden the
workers with overly complex instructions, we did
not mention this subjective-objective axis but asked
them instead to place ambiguous sentences towards
the center of the horizontal positive-negative axis
and more objective, non-opinionated sentences to-
wards the lower neutral tip of the triangle.

For each of the three HIT designs, we speci-
fied the requirement of three different unique as-
signments per HIT, which led to a total amount of
3 x 3 x 1000 = 9000 HIT assignments being up-
loaded on MTurk. Mind that setting the requirement
of unique assigments ensures a number of unique
workers per individual HIT, but does not ensure a
consistency of workers over a single batch of 1000
HITs. This is in the line with the philosophy of
crowdsourcing, which allows many different people
to participate in the same task.

4 Annotation Task Results and Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.9999681875">
After designing the HITs, we uploaded 30 random
samples for testing purposes. These HITs were com-
pleted in a matter of seconds, mostly by workers in
India. After a brief inspection of the results, it was
obvious that most answers corresponded to random
clicks. Therefore, we decided to include a small
competence test to ensure that future workers would
possess the necessary linguistic skills to perform the
task. The test consists of six simple categorisation
questions of the type of HIT1 that a skilled worker
would be able to perform in under a minute. In order
to discourage the use of automatic translation tools,
a time limit of two minutes was imposed and most
test sentences contain idiomatic constructions that
are known to pose problems to Machine Translation
Systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.99980125">
Table 1 contains statistics on the workers who com-
pleted our HITs. A total of 19 workers passed the
competence test and submitted at least one HIT. Of
those, four workers completed HITs belonging to
two different designs and six submitted HITs in all
three designs. Twelve workers are located in the US
(64%), three in Spain (16%), one in Mexico (5%),
Equador (5%), The Netherlands (5%) and an un-
known location (5%).
As to a comparison of completion times, it took
a worker on average 11 seconds to complete an in-
stance of HIT1, and 9 seconds to complete an in-
stance of HIT2 and HIT3. At first sight, this result
might seem surprising, since conceptually there is an
increase in complexity when moving from HIT1 to
HIT2 and from HIT2 to HIT3. These results might

4.2 Annotation Distributions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996145">
In order to get an overview of distribution of the re-
sults of each HIT, a histogram was plotted for each
different task. Figure 2a shows a uniform distribu-
tion of the three categories used in the simple cat-
egorization scheme of HIT1, as could be expected
from a balanced dataset.
Figure 2b shows the distribution of the graded cat-
egorization template of HIT2. Compared to the dis-
tribution in 2a, two observations can be made: (i)
the proportion of the zero values is almost identical
to the proportion of the neutral category in Figure
2a, and (ii) the proportion of the sum of the positive
values [+1,+5] and the proportion of the sum of the
negative values [-5,-1] are equally similar to the pro-
portion of the positive and negative categories in 2a.
This suggests that in order to map the graded annota-
tions of HIT2 to the categories of HIT1, an intuitive
partitioning of the graded scale into three equal parts
should be avoided. Instead, a more adequate alterna-
tive would consist of mapping [-5,-1] to negative, 0

to neutral and [+1,+5] to positive. This means that
even slightly positive/negative grades correspond to
positive/negative categories.
Figure 2c shows a heat map that plots the distri-
bution of the annotations in the triangle of HIT3. It
appears that worker annotations show a spontaneous
tendency of clustering, despite the continuous nature
of the design. This suggests that this HIT design,
originally conceived as continuous, was transformed
by the workers as a simpler categorization task using
five labels: negative, ambiguous and positive at the
top, neutral at the bottom, and other in the center.
Figure 2d shows the distribution of all data-
points in the triangle of Figure 2c, projected onto
the X-axis (positive/negative). Although similar to
the graded scale in HIT2, the distribution shows a
slightly higher polarization.
These results suggest that, out of all three HIT de-
signs, HIT2 is the one that contains the best balance
between the amount of information that can be ob-
tained and the simplicity of a one-dimensional an-
notation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998196">
4.3 Annotation Quality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997296">
The annotation quality of MTurk workers can be
measured by comparing them to expert annotations.
This is usually done by calculating inter-annotator
agreement (ITA) scores. Note that, since a single
HIT can contain more than one assignment and each
assignment is typically performed by more than one
annotator, we can only calculate ITA scores between
batches of assignments, rather than between individ-
ual workers. Therefore, we describe the ITA scores
in terms of batches. In Table 4.4, we present a com-
parison of standard kappa3 calculations (Eugenio
and Glass, 2004) between batches of assignments in
HIT1 and expert annotations.
We found an inter-batch ITA score of 0.598,
which indicates a moderate agreement due to fairly
consistent annotations between workers. When
comparing individual batches with expert annota-
tions, we found similar ITA scores, in the range be-
tween 0.628 and 0.649. This increase with respect
to the inter-batch score suggests a higher variability
among MTurk workers than between workers and
experts. In order to filter out noise in worker annota-
tions, we applied a simple majority voting procedure
in which we selected, for each sentence in HIT1, the
most voted category. This results in an additional

3In reality, we found that fixed and free margin Kappa values
were almost identical, which reflects the balanced distribution
of the dataset.

batch of annotations. This batch, refered in Table
4.4 as Majority, produced a considerably higher ITA
score of 0.716, which confirms the validity of the
majority voting scheme to obtain better annotations.
In addition, we calculated ITA scores between
three expert annotators on a separate, 500-sentence
dataset, randomly selected from the same corpus as
described at the start of Section 3. This collection
was later used as test set in the experiments de-
scribed in Section 5. The inter-expert ITA scores
on this separate dataset contains values of 0.725 for
κ1 and 0.729 for κ2, only marginally higher than the
Majority ITA scores. Although we are comparing
results on different data sets, these results seem to
indicate that multiple MTurk annotations are able to
produce a similar quality to expert annotations. This
might suggest that a further increase in the number
of HIT assignments would outperform expert ITA
scores, as was previously reported in (Snow et al.,
2008).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995947">
4.4 Annotation Costs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885258064516">
As explained in Section 3, a total amount of 9000
assignments were uploaded on MTurk. At a reward
of .02$ per assignment, a total sum of 225$ (180$
+ 45$ Amazon fees) was spent on the task. Work-
ers perceived an average hourly rate of 6.5$/hour for
HIT1 and 8$/hour for HIT2 and HIT3. These fig-
ures suggest that, at least for assignments of type
HIT2 and HIT3, a lower reward/assignment might
have been considered. This would also be consis-
tent with the recommendations of (Mason and Watts,
2009), who claim that lower rewards might have an
effect on the speed at which the task will be com-
pleted - more workers will be competing for the task
at any given moment - but not on the quality. Since
we were not certain whether a large enough crowd
existed with the necessary skills to perform our task,
we explicitly decided not to try to offer the lowest
possible price.
An in-house expert annotator (working at approx-
imately 70$/hour, including overhead) finished a
batch of 1000 HIT assignments in approximately
three hours, which leads to a total expert annotator
cost of 210$. By comparing this figure to the cost
of uploading 3 x 1000 HIT assignments (75$), we
saved 210 − 75 = 135$, which constitutes almost
65% of the cost of an expert annotator. These figures
do not take into account the costs of preparing the
data and HIT templates, but it can be assumed that
these costs will be marginal when large data sets are
used. Moreover, most of this effort is equally needed
for preparing data for in-house annotation.

A simple SVM-based supervised classification ap-

under consideration. According to this, two dif-
ferent groups of classifiers were used: a baseline
or reference group, and a contrastive group. Clas-

data samples extracted from the baseline and anno-

classifiers, three different binary classification sub-
tasks were considered: positive/not positive, nega-

binary classifiers were evaluated by computing pre-

well as overall classification accuracy, over the eval-

tems, and annotated dataset for contrastive systems.
Training subsample sets were always balanced with
respect to the original three categories: ‘positive’,
‘negative’ and ‘neutral’.
Table 4 presents the resulting mean values of
accuracy for each considered subtask in classifiers
trained with either the baseline or the annotated
dataset. As observed in the table, all subtasks ben-
efit from using the annotated dataset for training
the classifiers; however, it is important to mention
that while similar absolute gains are observed for
the ‘positive/not positive’ and ‘neutral/not neutral’
subtasks, this is not the case for the subtask ‘neg-
ative/not negative’, which actually gains much less
than the other two subtasks.
After considering all evaluation metrics, the bene-
fit provided by human-annotated data availability for
categories ‘neutral’ and ‘positive’ is evident. How-
ever, in the case of category ‘negative’, although
some gain is also observed, the benefit of human-
annotated data does not seem to be as much as for
the two other categories. This, along with the fact
that the ‘negative/not negative’ subtask is actually
the best performing one (in terms of accuracy) when
baseline training data is used, might suggest that
low rating comments contains a better representa-
tion of sentences belonging to category ‘negative’
than medium and high rating comments do with re-
spect to classes ‘neutral’ and ‘positive’.
In any case, this experimental work only verifies
the feasibility of constructing training datasets for
opinionated content analysis, as well as it provides
an approximated idea of costs involved in the gener-
ation of this type of resources, by using MTurk.

5.3 Experiment two: MTurk annotations vs.
expert annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683225">
In this section, we compare the results of training
several polarity classifiers on six different training
sets, each of them generated from the MTurk anno-
tations of HIT1. The different training sets are: (i)
the original dataset of 1000 sentences annotated by
experts (Experts), (ii) the first set of 1000 MTurk re-
sults (Batch1), (iii) the second set of 1000 MTurk
results (Batch2), (iv) the third set of 1000 MTurk
results (Batch3), (v) the batch obtained by major-
ity voting between Batch1, Batch2 and Batch3 (Ma-
jority), and (vi) a batch of 3000 training instances
obtained by aggregating Batch1, Batch2 and Batch3
(All). We used classifiers as implemented in Mal-
let (McCallum, 2002) and Weka (Hall et al., 2009),
based on a simple bag-of-words representation of
the sentences. As the objective was not to obtain
optimum performance but only to evaluate the dif-
ferences between different sets of annotations, all
classifiers were used with their default settings.
Table 5 contains results of four different clas-
sifiers (Maxent, C45, Winnow and SVM), trained
on these six different datasets and evaluated on the
same 500-sentence test set as explained in Section
5.1. Classification using expert annotations usu-
ally outperforms classification using a single batch
(one annotation per sentence) of annotations pro-
duced using MTurk. Using the tree annotations per
sentence available from MTurk, all classifiers reach
similar or better performance compared to the sin-
gle set of expert annotations, at a much lower cost
(as explained in section 4.4).
It is interesting to note that most classifiers bene-
fit from using the full 3000 training examples (1000
sentences with 3 annotations each), which intu-
itively makes sense as the unanimously labeled ex-
amples will have more weight in defining the model
of the corresponding class, whereas ambiguous or
unclear cases will have their impact reduced as their
characteristics are attributed to various classes.

an important drop in performance when using mul-
tiple annotations, but perform well when using the
majority vote. As a first intuition, this may be due to
the fact that SVMs focus on detecting class bound-
aries (and optimizing the margin between classes)
rather than developing a model of each class. As
such, having the same data point appear several
times with the same label will not aid in finding ap-
propriate support vectors, whereas having the same
data point with conflicting labels may have a nega-
tive impact on the margin maximization.
Having only evaluated each classifier (and train-
ing set) once on a static test set it is unfortunately not
possible to reliably infer the significance of the per-
formance differences (or determine confidence in-
tervals, etc.). For a more in-depth analysis it might
be interesting to use bootstrapping or similar tech-
niques to evaluate the robustness of the results.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665130434783">
In this paper we have examined the usefulness of
non-expert annotations on Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk to annotate the polarity of Spanish consumer
comments. We discussed the advantages/drawbacks
of three different HIT designs, ranging from a sim-
ple categorization scheme to a continous scoring
template. We report high inter-annotator agree-
ment scores between non-experts and expert anno-
tators and show that training an Opinion Mining
System with non-expert MTurk annotations outper-
forms original noisy annotations and obtains com-
petitive results when compared to expert annotations
using a variety of classifiers. In conclusion, we
found that, in our case, the use of non-expert anno-
tations through crowdsourcing is a viable and cost-
effective alternative to the use of expert annotations.
In the classification experiments reported in this
paper, we have relied exclusively on MTurk anno-
tations from HIT1. Further work is needed to fully
analyze the impact of each of the HIT designs for
Opinion Mining tasks. We hope that the added rich-
ness of annotation of HIT2 and HIT3 will enable us
to use more sophisticated classification methods.

<abstract confidence="0.999147952380952">One of the major bottlenecks in the development of data-driven AI Systems is the cost of reliable human annotations. The recent advent of several crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing requesters the access to affordable and rapid results of a global workforce, greatly facilitates the creation of massive training data. Most of the available studies on the effectiveness of crowdsourcing report on English data. We use Mechanical Turk annotations to train an Opinion Mining System to classify Spanish consumer comments. We design three different Human Intelligence Task (HIT) strategies and report high inter-annotator agreement between non-experts and expert annotators. We evaluate the advantages/drawbacks of each HIT design and show that, in our case, the use of non-expert annotations is a viable and costeffective alternative to expert annotations.</abstract>

This is usually done by calculating inter-annotator agreement (ITA) scores. Note that, since a single HIT can contain more than one assignment and each assignment is typically performed by more than one annotator, we can only calculate ITA scores between batches of assignments, rather than between individual workers. Therefore, we describe the ITA scores in terms of batches. In Table 4.4, we present a comparison of standard kappa3 calculations (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) between batches of assignments in HIT1 and expert annotations. We found an inter-batch ITA score of 0.598, which indicates a moderate agreement due to fairly consistent annotations between workers. When comparing individual batches with expert annotations, we found similar ITA scores, in the range between 0.628 and 0.649. This increase with respect to the inter-batch score suggests a higher variability among MTurk workers than between workers and experts. In order to filter out noise in worker annotations, we applied a simple majority voting procedure in which we selected, for each sentence i</context>

At a reward of .02$ per assignment, a total sum of 225$ (180$ + 45$ Amazon fees) was spent on the task. Workers perceived an average hourly rate of 6.5$/hour for HIT1 and 8$/hour for HIT2 and HIT3. These figures suggest that, at least for assignments of type HIT2 and HIT3, a lower reward/assignment might have been considered. This would also be consistent with the recommendations of (Mason and Watts, 2009), who claim that lower rewards might have an effect on the speed at which the task will be completed - more workers will be competing for the task at any given moment - but not on the quality. Since we were not certain whether a large enough crowd existed with the necessary skills to perform our task, we explicitly decided not to try to offer the lowest possible price. An in-house expert annotator (working at approximately 70$/hour, including overhead) finished a batch of 1000 HIT assignments in approximately three hours, which leads to a total expert annotator cost of 210$.
