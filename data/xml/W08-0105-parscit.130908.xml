Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998438">
We explore the role of redundancy, both in
anticipation of and in response to listener
confusion, in task-oriented dialogue. We
find that direction-givers provide redundant
utterances in response to both verbal and
non-verbal signals of listener confusion.
We also examine the effects of prior ac-
quaintance and visibility upon redundancy.
As expected, givers use more redundant ut-
terances overall, and more redundant utter-
ances in response to listener questions,
when communicating with strangers. We
discuss our findings in relation to theories
of redundancy, the balance of speaker and
listener effort, and potential applications.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946545454546">
Our everyday conversations represent a carefully
negotiated balance between the perceived needs of
the speaker and the listener. These opposing forces
affect every aspect of language from phonetics to
pragmatics. A careful balance between these two
forces allows speakers to produce language that is
both efficient and effective at communicating a
message (Lindblom, 1990; Horn, 1993). Of course,
the same balance is not appropriate for every situa-
tion. When accuracy is critical to the message, or
when the speaker perceives the listener to have
difficulty understanding, the speaker is more likely
to prioritize clarity over efficiency, resulting in
more explicit communication. In contrast, during
casual conversation or when speed is a factor, the
speaker may choose a more reduced, efficient,
communication style (Lindblom, 1990; Horton and
Keysar, 1996). A number of scholars have pointed
out that speakers seem to use the information
available to themselves rather than that available to
the listener to guide certain linguistic decisions,
such as clarity of pronunciation and choice of syn-

tactic structure (Bard et al., 2000; Branigan et al.,
2003). However, these studies examine utterance
form, while our study examines content, which is
more influenced by audience design (Branigan et
al., 2003). In every utterance, a speaker either re-
duces the likelihood of listener misunderstanding
by being more explicit, or reduces their own effort
by providing a minimal amount of information.
Regardless of whether speakers pro-actively moni-
tor the information needs of listeners, they do need
to respond when listeners say or do something to
indicate confusion. Developing a better under-
standing of the factors that affect how and when
speakers respond to signs of listener confusion is
important at both theoretical and applied levels:
first, it can better explain the variation in discourse
strategies used in different communicative situa-
tions; second, it can help in the design of dialogue
systems (Kopp et al., 2008; Theune et al., 2007).
In this study, we examine what types of listener
behavior increase the likelihood that a speaker will
produce a redundant utterance. We also examine
how communicative context affects the amount
redundancy a speaker produces overall (Walker,
1992, 1996) and a speaker’s use of redundancy in
response to listener confusion. In contrast to pre-
vious work, we study reactive redundancy, or re-
dundancy produced in response to signs of listener
confusion. We investigate two factors that may
influence a speaker’s tendency to produce redun-
dant utterances and to respond to listener confusion
with redundancy: the relationship between the in-
terlocutors and their visual contact.
In the following section, we review relevant li-
terature and present our hypotheses; we then de-
scribe the direction-giving experiment which we
used to examine redundancy in task-oriented di-
alogue, and present our results; we discuss our re-
sults in light of the literature and conclude by
noting potential applications and future work.

2.1 Redundancy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965023529412">
Grice’s (1975) second Maxim of Quantity: ‘Do not
make your contribution more informative than is
required’ has led to the general impression that
redundancy (providing discourse-old information)
is avoided in language (Stalnaker, 1978), with this
mirrored by work in natural language generation
(Dalianis, 1999). However, Walker (1992, 1996)
points out that such conclusions relating to redun-
dancy are often based on flawed assumptions. For
example, they assume that agents have unlimited
working memory and the ability to automatically
generate all the inferences entailed by every utter-
ance, that utterance production should be mini-
mized, and that assertions by Agent A are accepted
by default by Agent B (Walker, 1996: 183).
In fact, redundancy can serve many desirable
purposes in communication. Redundancy has been
shown to increase text cohesion and readability
(Horning, 1991) as well as provide evidence of
understanding and grounding, make a proposition
salient, and make inferences explicit (Walker,
1996). A computer simulation of a cooperative task
dialogue between two agents suggested that the use
of certain types of redundant utterances improved
the performance of the pair (Walker, 1996).
Fussell and Krauss (1989a) point out that there
are two methods that speakers can use to tailor
their message for the listener. The first method in-
volves predicting what information it is necessary
to communicate, using knowledge of the listener’s
interests and background. The second method in-
volves modifying the message in response to lis-
tener feedback. Walker’s model only captures the
use of redundancy in the service of the first me-
thod. We will refer to this type of redundancy as
proactive redundancy, whereby a speaker provides
redundant information without waiting for the lis-
tener to express a need for it. The advantages of
providing redundant information proactively in-
clude being able to integrate the redundant infor-
mation with the new information, and avoiding
conflict by removing the necessity for the listener
to express a lack of understanding (Brown and Le-
vinson, 1987).
We hypothesize that speakers also use redun-
dancy reactively, after the listener signals a lack of
understanding, either verbally or non-verbally.
This is redundancy in service of Fussell and
Krauss’ second method of message-tailoring. The
advantages of providing redundant information
reactively include increasing the efficiency of the
exchange by only providing redundant information
that the listener communicates a need for, and re-
ducing the burden on the speaker of having to de-
cide when to include redundant information.
One important distinction between proactive
and reactive redundancy is the grounding status of
the redundant information. Reactive redundancy is
likely to provide information that has not been ac-
cepted by the listener, and is therefore not part of
the common ground (Clark and Schaeffer, 1989),
even though it is discourse-old. In contrast, proac-
tive redundancy is likely to provide information
from the interlocutors’ common ground. Indeed,
Walker (1996) describes Attitude redundant utter-
ances as providing evidence of grounding. Walk-
er’s other types of proactive redundancy
(Consequence and Attention) make inferences
based on grounded utterances explicit and make
elements of the common ground salient again.
Reactive redundancy is one type of repair, like
expansions and replacements, which can be used in
response to non-understanding or misunderstand-
ing (Hirst et al., 1994). The type of miscommuni-
cation may influence a speaker’s choice of repair
strategy, with reactive redundancy being an appro-
priate response to mishearing or misremembering.
However, producing redundant information,
even when the listener signals a need for it, incurs
a cost. Including redundant information increases
the length of the dialogue and the speaker’s effort,
and decreases the amount of new information pro-
vided within a certain length of time. In these cases
the speaker must decide how much redundant in-
formation to provide and when to provide it.

2.2 Signals of Confusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974759">
Listeners can express a need for information to be
repeated or restated in a number of ways, both ver-
bally and non-verbally. Brinton et al. (1988) used
questions and statements of confusion (“I didn’t
understand”) as signs of communication break-
downs. Morrow et al. (1993) describe inaccurate
and partial repetitions of instructions as elements
of miscommunication. This prior work leads us to
examine questions, utterances signaling non-
understanding (e.g. “I don’t remember what’s
</bodyText>

next”), incorrect repetitions (e.g. “take the third
right” after the direction-giver said “take the
second right”) and abandoned utterances (e.g.
“Then I’ll turn...”) as possible signs of listener
confusion. We predict redundancy after such
statements because they all indicate that a piece of
information has not been understood.
We also examine eye-gaze as a non-verbal
marker of listener comprehension. Goodwin (1981)
described gaze towards the speaker as a sign of
listener attention. However, Nakano et al. (2003)
found that speakers seemed to interpret a listener
gazing at them rather than at a map as a sign of
listener misunderstanding. Therefore, shifting eye-
gaze away from the speaker can signal that a lis-
tener is losing attention, perhaps due to confusion,
while shifting gaze towards the speaker can signal
misunderstanding. In this study there is no map,
and listeners who can see the speaker spend most
of the conversation gazing at the speaker. Still, due
to the opposing findings in the literature, we ana-
lyze eye-gaze shifts both towards and away from
the speaker as potential signs of listener confusion.

2.3 Relationship and Communication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998188">
Speakers are more explicit when communicating
with strangers or people with whom they share less
common ground. This explicitness can take the
form of highly informative self-introductions on
the phone (Hornstein, 1985), longer descriptions of
abstract figures (Fussell and Krauss, 1989b), and
explicit references to utterance topics (Svedsen and
Evjemo, 2003). These studies indicate that speak-
ers attempt to make up for the small amount of
common ground they share with strangers by in-
cluding more information in the discourse itself.
Another difference between friends and non-
friends is that acquaintances tend to be more for-
mal, more concerned with self presentation, less
negative, and less likely to disagree than friends
(Schlenker, 1984; Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal,
1990; Planalp and Benson, 1992). Therefore, we
expect that in an initial interaction, a speaker will
try to appear competent and avoid conflict.
As noted above, speakers talking to strangers
are more explicit, leading us to predict more re-
dundancy overall. They are also more likely to try
to impress their interlocutor and avoid conflict,
leading to more reactive redundancy in response to
confusion when the pair are strangers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996748">
2.4 Visibility and Communication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997325">
Visibility also has a number of effects on commu-
nication. One of the most basic is that when inter-
locutors cannot see each other they cannot use non-
verbal signals to communicate, so they must rely
on verbal communication. For example, the use of
eye-gaze as a sign of listener attention (Argyle and
Cook, 1976; Goodwin, 1981) is only possible
when interlocutors can see each other. When they
cannot see each other, they must indicate attention
verbally or do without this information.
Visibility affects both the form and the out-
comes of a conversation. When interlocutors can-
not see each other, conversations are longer and
contain more, shorter, utterances than when they
can (Nakano et al., 2003). Interlocutors in an in-
vestment game who could not see each other also
did not establish trust to the same extent as those
who met face-to-face (Bos et al., 2002).
Because speakers who cannot see each other
have fewer channels of communication available to
them, their interaction can be more difficult than a
face-to-face interaction. We predict that this will
lead them to use more redundancy and more reac-
tive redundancy in an effort to be clear.

2.5 Hypotheses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984090909091">
In order to study how responsive speakers are to
signs of listener confusion, we must first determine
what signs speakers respond to. In this study we
examine a number of verbal and non-verbal signs
speakers may use to gauge listener confusion. In
particular, we expect that speakers will provide
redundancy in response to both verbal signs like
questions, statements of non-understanding, incor-
rect statements, and abandoned utterances, and
non-verbal signs like eye-gaze changes. We expect
that speakers will strike a different balance be-
tween efficiency (minimizing speaker effort) and
clarity (minimizing listener effort) depending on
the relationship between the speaker and listener,
and the physical context of the interaction. We ex-
pect speakers to use redundancy strategies focused
on minimizing speaker effort when addressing
friends and people they can see. Such strategies
involve less redundancy (and therefore less speak-
ing), and less reactive redundancy (requiring less
listener monitoring). Conversely, we expect to find
redundancy strategies maximizing clarity when

speakers address strangers and people they cannot
see. Such strategies involve more redundancy
overall (providing the listener with more informa-
tion in general) as well as more reactive redundan-
cy (which provides the listener with the specific
information they may require).
Hypothesis 1 - Redundancy and Non-
Understanding

(a) Verbal cues - Direction-givers will provide
redundancy when the receiver verbally expresses a
lack of understanding by asking a question, aban-

(b) Non-verbal cues - Givers will provide redun-
dancy when the receiver non-verbally expresses a
lack of understanding by shifting eye-gaze.

Hypothesis 2 - Redundancy and Relationship
Givers will prioritize clarity over efficiency in their
redundancy use when speaking to strangers, pro-
viding (a) more redundancy and (b) more reactive
redundancy than when speaking to friends.
Hypothesis 3 - Redundancy and Visual Contact
Givers will prioritize clarity over efficiency in their
redundancy use when they cannot see their partner,
providing (a) more redundancy and (b) more reac-

3.1 Participants

<bodyText confidence="0.999991875">
Twenty-four university students participated, re-
sulting in twelve dyads. All were paid $10 for their
participation and received $5 gift certificates if
they successfully completed the task. In each dyad
the direction-giver was familiar with the building
in which the experiment took place, and the direc-
tion-receiver was unfamiliar with it. Half the dyads
were pairs of friends and half were strangers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999035">
3.2 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984967741935">
The task consisted of three consecutive direction-
giving sessions, as described in Cassell et al.
(2007). At the start of each session, the experimen-
ter led the direction-giver to a point in the building,
and back to the experiment room. Half of the dyads
sat facing each other during the direction-giving
(the Vision condition) and half sat back-to-back
with a screen between them (the No-vision condi-
tion). The direction-giver then explained the route
to the direction-receiver. There were no time limits
or restrictions on what could be said, but the dyads
could not use maps or props. When the dyad de-
cided that direction-giving was complete, they sig-
naled the experimenter, who the receiver led to the
goal, following the directions.
The direction-giving sessions were videotaped.
Participants’ speech was transcribed and coded for
possible redundancy triggers and redundant utter-
ances using the coding scheme described below.
The time-aligned codings for the giver and receiver
were aligned with each other using scripts that cal-
culated which of the receiver’s utterances or ac-
tions directly preceded which of the giver’s
utterances. The scripts classify a receiver’s utter-
ance or action as ‘preceding’ a giver’s utterance if
its start precedes the start of the giver’s utterance
and its end is not more than two seconds before the
start of the giver’s utterance. The two-second limit
was used to avoid positing connections between a
giver’s utterance and receiver utterances that came
long before it.

3.3 Data Coding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968259259259">
Each dialogue was divided into clauses, defined as
units that include a subject and predicate and ex-
press a proposition. Each clause was coded using a
modified version of DAMSL (Core and Allen,
1997). Direction-givers’ and receivers’ speech was
coded differently because we only studied redun-
dancy produced by the giver. We coded the receiv-
er’s speech for signs of confusion. We describe the
labels we used in more detail below.
Each direction-giver’s clauses were coded for
Statements and Info-requests. The Info-request tag
marks questions and other requests for informa-
tion. In a Statement, a speaker makes a claim about
the world. The class of Statements was broken
down into Non-redundant, in which the speaker is
trying to change or add to the hearer’s beliefs, and
Redundant, which contain only information that
has already been stated or entailed.
Each direction-receiver’s clauses were coded
for Statements, Info-requests, Signal non-
understandings (S.N.U.), and Abandoned utter-
ances. The receiver’s Statements were classified as
either Correct or Incorrect. If an utterance explicit-
ly expressed non-understanding of an earlier utter-
ance it was coded as Signal non-understanding.
This label was only used for direct statements of
non-understanding, such as “I didn’t follow that,”

and not for signals of non-understanding covered
by other labels such as Info-requests and Incorrect
Statements. Utterances that were abandoned (the
speaker stops the utterance and it provides no con-
tent to the dialogue) were coded as Abandoned.
Receiver utterances that were not coded as Info-
requests, Incorrect Statements, Signal-non-
understandings, or Abandoned, were coded as No-
trigger. No-trigger utterances included correct
statements and statements about task management.

We found that a large proportion of giver utter-

from our recordings are listed in the Appendix.
We first analyzed the data using a hierarchical
loglinear analysis with the variables: visual condi-

Strangers), receiver-utterance (Info-request, Incor-

(Redundant, Non-redundant). The overall model is

ing chi-square comparisons of individual factors
within the model. We report tests of partial associ-

We tested part (a) of Hypothesis 1 by running a
test of partial associations (adjusted for all effects
in the model) and an unpartialled chi-square (ig-

tween receiver-utterance and giver-utterance type
(Partial χ2(4,5294)=117.7, p&lt;.001;
χ2(4,5294)=121.2,p&lt;.001).
Chi-square tests comparing giver-utterances fol-
lowing predicted redundancy triggers to giver-

are significant (χ2(59,2815)=9582.4, p&lt;.001).
A test of partial associations and a chi-square

<bodyText confidence="0.999972018867925">
This study set out to discover what verbal and non-
verbal behaviors increase the likelihood of redun-
dant utterances in direction-givers’ speech. We
also examined whether the interlocutors’ relation-
ship or visual contact influence whether speakers
provide redundant utterances in anticipation of and
in response to listener confusion. We found that
givers used a large proportion of redundant utter-
ances, (around 25% of utterances). Walker (1996)
found that about 12% of utterances were redundant
in a corpus of recordings from a call-in financial
radio show. The higher proportion of redundant
utterances in our study is predicted by Walker’s
(1996) model, in which a task’s tolerance for com-
prehension errors influences whether redundant
utterances are produced. In a radio advice show, a
misunderstanding may be more easily recovered
from than in direction-giving, in which one wrong
turn could make it impossible to reach the goal.
In addition to revealing the impact of task toler-
ance to error on redundancy, this study sheds light
on other circumstances that influence redundancy
use. Givers produced reactive redundancy in re-
sponse to the verbal triggers: Info-requests, Aban-
doned utterances, and Incorrect statements.
However, even these triggers were not always fol-
lowed by redundancy. In fact, only around 50% of
the utterances following these triggers were redun-
dant. Such a low response rate is surprising until
we consider the diversity of utterances covered by
these labels. For instance, some Info-requests seek
new information (e.g. “What’s at the top of the
stairs?”), and some receiver utterances are aban-
doned because the giver interrupts with new in-
formation. Our study lays the groundwork for
future examinations of speaker responses to listen-
er confusion, which can refine these broad catego-
ries. We must also consider the variability in
responses to listener confusion. We found that giv-
ers are more likely to provide redundant utterances
in response to questions when speaking to stran-
gers, but this is only one of many factors that could
affect levels of responsiveness, including speaker
personality, time pressure, and task difficulty.
The non-significant effect of Signals non-
understandings on redundancy is surprising. This
may be due to the small number of examples of
this category in our recordings. We found only 44
instances of Signal non-understandings, in contrast
to, for example, 156 Abandoned utterances.
The non-verbal cue gaze change also increased
the likelihood of a redundant utterance. Interesting-
ly, gaze changes both to and away from the giver

triggered redundancy. This is consistent with both
Nakano et al.’s (2003) finding that gazing at the
speaker signals listener misunderstanding and
Goodwin’s (1981) finding that gazing away from
the speaker indicates a lack of listener attention.
It is interesting that 24% of giver utterances fol-
lowing No-trigger receiver utterances were redun-
dant. These probably include both redundant
utterances triggered by signs of listener confusion
that we did not code for, and proactive redundancy.
Proactive redundancy can appear within the first
description of some directions (see the No-trigger
example in the Appendix) and when the whole set
of directions is repeated as a memory aid.
The relationship between the interlocutors does
affect the amount of redundancy speakers produce
overall and in response to listener signs of confu-
sion. Strangers used more redundant utterances
than friends and provided more redundant utter-
ances after questions. This supports our hypothesis
that direction-givers speaking to strangers will pri-
oritize clarity over efficiency. The more consistent
use of reactive redundancy in the Strangers condi-
tion may be due to speakers’ tendency to avoid
confrontation with strangers. When responding to
questions from friends, direction-givers may pro-
vide some new information because they know that
their friend will feel comfortable asking another
question if their answer is unclear. However, when
answering questions from a stranger, the giver may
wish to avoid the embarrassment of further confu-
sion by repeating more discourse-old information.
However, contrary to our predictions, we did
not find more redundancy or more reactive redun-
dancy in the No-vision condition than the Vision
condition. In fact, we found numerically more re-
dundancy in the Vision condition. Given the low
level of significance, we do not discuss this in de-
tail, however we suggest that this could be due to
the fact that there are more ways of signaling non-
understanding available to the receivers in the Vi-
sion condition (both verbal and non-verbal). There-
fore, even if givers do not increase their rates of
reactive redundancy in the Vision condition, they
could provide more reactive redundancy (and more
redundancy overall) because they are receiving
more cues to react to. Not all situations leading to
communication difficulties encourage more redun-
dancy or more reactive redundancy, but the in-
creased explicitness and positivity typical of
conversation between strangers do encourage it.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953829268292">
This study explored the use of redundancy in task-
oriented dialogue, specifically the effects of listen-
er behavior and communicative context on the
amount of redundancy produced. We found that
direction-givers provided redundant utterances in
response to verbal and non-verbal signs of listener
confusion. As predicted, givers were more likely to
prioritize clarity over efficiency in their redundan-
cy use (using more redundancy overall and more
redundancy in response to questions) when speak-
ing to strangers than friends. Contrary to our pre-
dictions, givers did not provide more redundant
utterances when they could not see their listener.
Direction-giving, due to its high memory load
and the need for the receiver to understand the giv-
er almost completely, is a type of discourse that
may encourage more redundancy than other types.
Indeed, we note that our data have a much greater
proportion of redundancies than discussions taken
from radio talk shows (Walker, 1996). Future work
should examine the nature of proactive and reac-
tive redundancy in more varied discourse contexts,
such as negotiation, teaching, and play. It should
also explore the effects of memory load on redun-
dancy by varying task complexity, which may be
easier with a more controlled task like the Map-
task. Researchers could study the relationship be-
tween saliency and redundancy by studying
correlations between a segment’s salience and its
likelihood of being used in a redundant utterance.
Our findings can be used to improve the com-
municative efficacy of natural language generation
systems like those used in Embodied Conversa-
tional Agents (ECAs; Kopp et al., 2008). For ex-
ample, like strangers, direction-giving ECAs could
use increased overall and reactive redundancy to
compensate for the lack of shared common ground
with the human user of the system. Analyses of the
syntactic structures of different types of redundant
utterances will be important for incorporating these
results into generation systems.

They are also more likely to try to impress their interlocutor and avoid conflict, leading to more reactive redundancy in response to confusion when the pair are strangers. 2.4 Visibility and Communication Visibility also has a number of effects on communication. One of the most basic is that when interlocutors cannot see each other they cannot use nonverbal signals to communicate, so they must rely on verbal communication. For example, the use of eye-gaze as a sign of listener attention (Argyle and Cook, 1976; Goodwin, 1981) is only possible when interlocutors can see each other. When they cannot see each other, they must indicate attention verbally or do without this information. Visibility affects both the form and the outcomes of a conversation. When interlocutors cannot see each other, conversations are longer and contain more, shorter, utterances than when they can (Nakano et al., 2003). Interlocutors in an investment game who could not see each other also did not establish trust to the same extent as those who met face-to-face (Bos et al., 2002).

Walker’s model only captures the use of redundancy in the service of the first method. We will refer to this type of redundancy as proactive redundancy, whereby a speaker provides redundant information without waiting for the listener to express a need for it. The advantages of providing redundant information proactively include being able to integrate the redundant information with the new information, and avoiding conflict by removing the necessity for the listener to express a lack of understanding (Brown and Levinson, 1987). We hypothesize that speakers also use redundancy reactively, after the listener signals a lack of understanding, either verbally or non-verbally. This is redundancy in service of Fussell and Krauss’ second method of message-tailoring. The advantages of providing redundant information reactively include increasing the efficiency of the exchange by only providing redundant information that the listener communicates a need for, and reducing the burden on the speaker of having to decide when to include redundant information.

All were paid $10 for their participation and received $5 gift certificates if they successfully completed the task. In each dyad the direction-giver was familiar with the building in which the experiment took place, and the direction-receiver was unfamiliar with it. Half the dyads were pairs of friends and half were strangers. 3.2 Procedure The task consisted of three consecutive directiongiving sessions, as described in Cassell et al. (2007). At the start of each session, the experimenter led the direction-giver to a point in the building, and back to the experiment room. Half of the dyads sat facing each other during the direction-giving (the Vision condition) and half sat back-to-back with a screen between them (the No-vision condition). The direction-giver then explained the route to the direction-receiver. There were no time limits or restrictions on what could be said, but the dyads could not use maps or props. When the dyad decided that direction-giving was complete, they signaled the experimenter, who the receiver led to t</context>

The advantages of providing redundant information reactively include increasing the efficiency of the exchange by only providing redundant information that the listener communicates a need for, and reducing the burden on the speaker of having to decide when to include redundant information. One important distinction between proactive and reactive redundancy is the grounding status of the redundant information. Reactive redundancy is likely to provide information that has not been accepted by the listener, and is therefore not part of the common ground (Clark and Schaeffer, 1989), even though it is discourse-old. In contrast, proactive redundancy is likely to provide information from the interlocutors’ common ground. Indeed, Walker (1996) describes Attitude redundant utterances as providing evidence of grounding. Walker’s other types of proactive redundancy (Consequence and Attention) make inferences based on grounded utterances explicit and make elements of the common ground salient again. Reactive redundancy is one type of repair, like expansions and replacements, which can be used in response to non-understanding or misunderstanding (Hirst et al., 1994). The type o</context>

The scripts classify a receiver’s utterance or action as ‘preceding’ a giver’s utterance if its start precedes the start of the giver’s utterance and its end is not more than two seconds before the start of the giver’s utterance. The two-second limit was used to avoid positing connections between a giver’s utterance and receiver utterances that came long before it. 3.3 Data Coding Each dialogue was divided into clauses, defined as units that include a subject and predicate and express a proposition. Each clause was coded using a modified version of DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997). Direction-givers’ and receivers’ speech was coded differently because we only studied redundancy produced by the giver. We coded the receiver’s speech for signs of confusion. We describe the labels we used in more detail below. Each direction-giver’s clauses were coded for Statements and Info-requests. The Info-request tag marks questions and other requests for information. In a Statement, a speaker makes a claim about the world. The class of Statements was broken down into Non-redundant, in which the speaker is trying to change or add to the hearer’s beliefs, and Redundant, which contain on</context>

However, Walker (1992, 1996) points out that such conclusions relating to redundancy are often based on flawed assumptions. For example, they assume that agents have unlimited working memory and the ability to automatically generate all the inferences entailed by every utterance, that utterance production should be minimized, and that assertions by Agent A are accepted by default by Agent B (Walker, 1996: 183). In fact, redundancy can serve many desirable purposes in communication. Redundancy has been shown to increase text cohesion and readability (Horning, 1991) as well as provide evidence</context>

In fact, redundancy can serve many desirable purposes in communication. Redundancy has been shown to increase text cohesion and readability (Horning, 1991) as well as provide evidence of understanding and grounding, make a proposition salient, and make inferences explicit (Walker, 1996). A computer simulation of a cooperative task dialogue between two agents suggested that the use of certain types of redundant utterances improved the performance of the pair (Walker, 1996). Fussell and Krauss (1989a) point out that there are two methods that speakers can use to tailor their message for the listener. The first method involves predicting what information it is necessary to communicate, using knowledge of the listener’s interests and background. The second method involves modifying the message in response to listener feedback. Walker’s model only captures the use of redundancy in the service of the first method. We will refer to this type of redundancy as proactive redundancy, whereby a speaker provides redundant information without waiting for the listener to express a need for it. The ad</context>

In this study there is no map, and listeners who can see the speaker spend most of the conversation gazing at the speaker. Still, due to the opposing findings in the literature, we analyze eye-gaze shifts both towards and away from the speaker as potential signs of listener confusion. 2.3 Relationship and Communication Speakers are more explicit when communicating with strangers or people with whom they share less common ground. This explicitness can take the form of highly informative self-introductions on the phone (Hornstein, 1985), longer descriptions of abstract figures (Fussell and Krauss, 1989b), and explicit references to utterance topics (Svedsen and Evjemo, 2003). These studies indicate that speakers attempt to make up for the small amount of common ground they share with strangers by including more information in the discourse itself. Another difference between friends and nonfriends is that acquaintances tend to be more formal, more concerned with self presentation, less negative, and less likely to disagree than friends (Schlenker, 1984; Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal, 1990; Planalp and Benson, 1992).

This prior work leads us to examine questions, utterances signaling nonunderstanding (e.g. “I don’t remember what’s 38 next”), incorrect repetitions (e.g. “take the third right” after the direction-giver said “take the second right”) and abandoned utterances (e.g. “Then I’ll turn...”) as possible signs of listener confusion. We predict redundancy after such statements because they all indicate that a piece of information has not been understood. We also examine eye-gaze as a non-verbal marker of listener comprehension. Goodwin (1981) described gaze towards the speaker as a sign of listener attention. However, Nakano et al. (2003) found that speakers seemed to interpret a listener gazing at them rather than at a map as a sign of listener misunderstanding. Therefore, shifting eyegaze away from the speaker can signal that a listener is losing attention, perhaps due to confusion, while shifting gaze towards the speaker can signal misunderstanding. In this study there is no map, and listeners who can see the speaker spend most of the conversation gazing at the speaker. Still, due to the opposing findings in the literature, we </context>

They are also more likely to try to impress their interlocutor and avoid conflict, leading to more reactive redundancy in response to confusion when the pair are strangers. 2.4 Visibility and Communication Visibility also has a number of effects on communication. One of the most basic is that when interlocutors cannot see each other they cannot use nonverbal signals to communicate, so they must rely on verbal communication. For example, the use of eye-gaze as a sign of listener attention (Argyle and Cook, 1976; Goodwin, 1981) is only possible when interlocutors can see each other. When they cannot see each other, they must indicate attention verbally or do without this information. Visibility affects both the form and the outcomes of a conversation. When interlocutors cannot see each other, conversations are longer and contain more, shorter, utterances than when they can (Nakano et al., 2003). Interlocutors in an investment game who could not see each other also did not establish trust to the same extent as those who met face-to-face (Bos et al., 2002).

Reactive redundancy is one type of repair, like expansions and replacements, which can be used in response to non-understanding or misunderstanding (Hirst et al., 1994). The type of miscommunication may influence a speaker’s choice of repair strategy, with reactive redundancy being an appropriate response to mishearing or misremembering. However, producing redundant information, even when the listener signals a need for it, incurs a cost. Including redundant information increases the length of the dialogue and the speaker’s effort, and decreases the amount of new information provided within a certain length of time. In these cases the speaker must decide how much redundant information to provide and when to provide it. 2.2 Signals of Confusion Listeners can </context>

We discuss our findings in relation to theories of redundancy, the balance of speaker and listener effort, and potential applications. 1 Introduction Our everyday conversations represent a carefully negotiated balance between the perceived needs of the speaker and the listener. These opposing forces affect every aspect of language from phonetics to pragmatics. A careful balance between these two forces allows speakers to produce language that is both efficient and effective at communicating a message (Lindblom, 1990; Horn, 1993). Of course, the same balance is not appropriate for every situation. When accuracy is critical to the message, or when the speaker perceives the listener to have difficulty understanding, the speaker is more likely to prioritize clarity over efficiency, resulting in more explicit communication. In contrast, during casual conversation or when speed is a factor, the speaker may choose a more reduced, efficient, communication style (Lindblom, 1990; Horton and Keysar, 1996).

Regardless of whether speakers pro-actively monitor the information needs of listeners, they do need to respond when listeners say or do something to indicate confusion. Developing a better understanding of the factors that affect how and when speakers respond to signs of listener confusion is important at both theoretical and applied levels: first, it can better explain the variation in discourse strategies used in different communicative situations; second, it can help in the design of dialogue systems (Kopp et al., 2008; Theune et al., 2007). In this study, we examine what types of listener behavior increase the likelihood that a speaker will produce a redundant utterance. We also examine how communicative context affects the amount redundancy a speaker produces overall (Walker, 1992, 1996) and a speaker’s use of redundancy in response to listener confusion. In contrast to previous work, we study reactive redundancy, or redundancy produced in response to signs of listener confusion.

For example, the use of eye-gaze as a sign of listener attention (Argyle and Cook, 1976; Goodwin, 1981) is only possible when interlocutors can see each other. When they cannot see each other, they must indicate attention verbally or do without this information. Visibility affects both the form and the outcomes of a conversation. When interlocutors cannot see each other, conversations are longer and contain more, shorter, utterances than when they can (Nakano et al., 2003). Interlocutors in an investment game who could not see each other also did not establish trust to the same extent as those who met face-to-face (Bos et al., 2002). Because speakers who cannot see each other have fewer channels of communication available to them, their interaction can be more difficult than a face-to-face interaction. We predict that this will lead them to use more redundancy and more reactive redundancy in an effort to be clear. 2.5 Hypotheses In order to study how responsive speakers are to signs of listener confusion, we must first determine what signs speakers respond to. </context>

These studies indicate that speakers attempt to make up for the small amount of common ground they share with strangers by including more information in the discourse itself. Another difference between friends and nonfriends is that acquaintances tend to be more formal, more concerned with self presentation, less negative, and less likely to disagree than friends (Schlenker, 1984; Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal, 1990; Planalp and Benson, 1992).

In this study, we examine what types of listener behavior increase the likelihood that a speaker will produce a redundant utterance. We also examine how communicative context affects the amount redundancy a speaker produces overall (Walker, 1992, 1996) and a speaker’s use of redundancy in response to listener confusion. In contrast to previous work, we study reactive redundancy, or redundancy produced in response to signs of listener confusion. We investigate two factors that may influence a speaker’s tendency to produce redundant utterances and to respond to listener confusion with redundancy: the relationship between the interlocutors and their visual contact. In the following section, we review relevant literature and present our hypotheses; we then describe the direction-giving experiment which we used to examine redundancy in ta</context>

Redundancy has been shown to increase text cohesion and readability (Horning, 1991) as well as provide evidence of understanding and grounding, make a proposition salient, and make inferences explicit (Walker, 1996). A computer simulation of a cooperative task dialogue between two agents suggested that the use of certain types of redundant utterances improved the performance of the pair (Walker, 1996). Fussell and Krauss (1989a) point out that there are two methods that speakers can use to tailor their message for </context>

One important distinction between proactive and reactive redundancy is the grounding status of the redundant information. Reactive redundancy is likely to provide information that has not been accepted by the listener, and is therefore not part of the common ground (Clark and Schaeffer, 1989), even though it is discourse-old. In contrast, proactive redundancy is likely to provide information from the interlocutors’ common ground. Indeed, Walker (1996) describes Attitude redundant utterances as providing evidence of grounding. Walker’s other types of proactive redundancy (Consequence and Attention) make inferences based on grounded utterances explicit and make elements of the common ground salient again. Reactive redundancy is one type of repair, like expansions and replacements, which can be used in response to non-understanding or misunderstanding (Hirst et al., 1994). The type of miscommunication may influence a speaker’s choice of repair strategy, with reactive redundancy being an appropriate response to mishearing or misremembering. Ho</context>

We also examined whether the interlocutors’ relationship or visual contact influence whether speakers provide redundant utterances in anticipation of and in response to listener confusion. We found that givers used a large proportion of redundant utterances, (around 25% of utterances). Walker (1996) found that about 12% of utterances were redundant in a corpus of recordings from a call-in financial radio show. The higher proportion of redundant utterances in our study is predicted by Walker’s (1996) model, in which a task’s tolerance for comprehension errors influences whether redundant utterances are produced. In a radio advice show, a misunderstanding may be more easily recovered from than in direction-giving, in which one wrong turn could make it impossible to reach the goal. In addition to revealing the impact of task tolerance to error on redundancy, this study sheds light on other </context>

Contrary to our predictions, givers did not provide more redundant utterances when they could not see their listener. Direction-giving, due to its high memory load and the need for the receiver to understand the giver almost completely, is a type of discourse that may encourage more redundancy than other types. Indeed, we note that our data have a much greater proportion of redundancies than discussions taken from radio talk shows (Walker, 1996). Future work should examine the nature of proactive and reactive redundancy in more varied discourse contexts, such as negotiation, teaching, and play. It should also explore the effects of memory load on redundancy by varying task complexity, which may be easier with a more controlled task like the Maptask. Researchers could study the relationship between saliency and redundancy by studying correlations between a segment’s salience and its likelihood of being used in a redundant utterance. Our findings can be used to improve the communicative efficacy of natural language generation systems l</context>
