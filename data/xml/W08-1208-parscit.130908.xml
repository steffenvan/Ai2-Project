Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999975647058824">
We have built a parallel treebank that
includes word and phrase alignment.
The alignment information was manually
checked using a graphical tool that al-
lows the annotator to view a pair of trees
from parallel sentences. We found the
compilation of clear alignment guidelines
to be a difficult task. However, experi-
ments with a group of students have shown
that we are on the right track with up to
89% overlap between the student annota-
tion and our own. At the same time these
experiments have helped us to pin-point
the weaknesses in the guidelines, many of
which concerned unclear rules related to
differences in grammatical forms between
the languages.

Establishing translation correspondences is a dif-
ficult task. This task is traditionally called align-
ment and is usually performed on the paragraph
level, sentence level and word level. Alignment
answers the question: Which part of a text in lan-
guage L1 corresponds in meaning to which part of
a text in language L2 (under the assumption that
the two texts represent the same meaning in differ-
ent languages). This may mean that one text is the
translation of the other or that both are translations
derived from a third text.
There is considerable interest in automating the
alignment process. Automatic sentence alignment

of legacy translations helps to fill translation mem-
ories. Automatic word alignment is a crucial step
in training statistical machine translation systems.
Both sentence and word alignment have to deal
with 1:many alignments, i.e. sometimes a sentence
in one language is translated as two or three sen-
tences in the other language.
In other respects sentence alignment and word
alignment are fundamentally different. It is rela-
tively safe to assume the same sentence order in
both languages when computing sentence align-
ment. But such a monotonicity assumption is not
possible for word alignment which needs to allow
for word order differences and thus for crossing
alignments. And while algorithms for sentence
alignment usually focus on length comparisons (in
terms of numbers of characters), word alignment
algorithms use cross-language cooccurrence fre-
quencies as a key feature.
Our work focuses on word alignment and on an
intermediate alignment level which we call phrase
alignment. Phrase alignment encompasses the
alignment from simple noun phrases and preposi-
tional phrases all the way to complex clauses. For
example, on the word alignment level we want to
establish the correspondence of the German “verb
form plus separated prefix” fang an with the Eng-
lish verb form began. While in phrase alignment
we mark the correspondence of the verb phrases
ihn in den Briefkasten gesteckt and dropped it in
the mail box.
We regard phrase alignment as alignment be-
tween linguistically motivated phrases, in con-
trast to some work in statistical machine trans-
lation where phrase alignment is defined as the
alignment between arbitrary word sequences. Our
phrase alignment is alignment between nodes in
constituent structure trees. See figure 1 for an ex-

ample of a tree pair with word and phrase align-
ment.
We believe that such linguistically motivated
phrase alignment provides useful phrase pairs for
example-based machine translation, and provides
interesting insights for translation science and
cross-language comparisons. Phrase alignments
are particularly useful for annotating correspon-
dences of idiomatic or metaphoric language use.

2 The Parallel Treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981557692308">
We have built a trilingual parallel treebank in Eng-
lish, German and Swedish. The treebank consists
of around 500 trees from the novel Sophie’s World
and 500 trees from economy texts (an annual re-
port from a bank, a quarterly report from an inter-
national engineering company, and the banana cer-
tification program of the Rainforest Alliance). The
sentences in Sophie’s World are relatively short
(14.8 tokens on average in the English version),
while the sentences in the economy texts are much
longer (24.3 tokens on average; 5 sentences in the
English version have more than 100 tokens).
The treebanks in English and German consist of
constituent structure trees that follow the guide-
lines of existing treebanks, the NEGRA/TIGER
guidelines for German and the Penn treebank
guidelines for English. There were no guidelines
for Swedish constituent structure trees. We have
therefore adapted the German treebank guidelines
for Swedish. Both German trees and Swedish trees
are annotated with flat structures but subsequently
automatically deepened to result in richer and lin-
guistically more plausible tree structures.
When the monolingual treebanks were finished,
we started with the word and phrase alignment.
For this purpose we have developed a special tool
called the Stockholm TreeAligner (Lundborg et
al., 2007) which displays two trees and allows the
user to draw alignment lines by clicking on nodes
and words. This tool is similar to word alignment
tools like ILink (Ahrenberg et al., 2003) or Cairo
(Smith and Jahr, 2000). As far as we know our tool
is unique in that it allows the alignments of lin-
guistically motivated phrases via node alignments
in parallel constituent structure trees (cf. (Samuels-
son and Volk, 2007)).
After having solved the technical issues, the
challenge was to compile precise and comprehen-
sive guidelines to ensure smooth and consistent
alignment decisions. In (Samuelsson and Volk,
2006) we have reported on a first experiment to
evaluate inter-annotator agreement from our align-
ment tasks.
In this paper we report on another recently con-
ducted experiment in which we tried to identify
the weaknesses in our alignment guidelines. We
asked 12 students to alignment 20 tree pairs (Eng-
lish and German) taken from our parallel treebank.
By comparing their alignments to our Gold Stan-
dard and to each other we gained valuable insights
into the difficulty of the alignment task and the
quality of our guidelines.

3 Related Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967142857143">
Our research on word and phrase alignment is re-
lated to previous work on word alignment as e.g.
in the Blinker project (Melamed, 1998) or in the
UPLUG project (Ahrenberg et al., 2003). Align-
ment work on parallel treebanks is rare. Most
notably there is the Prague Czech-English tree-
bank (Kruijff-Korbayov´a et al., 2006) and the
Link¨oping Swedish-English treebank (Ahrenberg,
2007). There has not been much work on the align-
ment of linguistically motivated phrases. Tinsley
et al. (2007) and Groves et al. (2004) report on
semi-automatic phrase alignment as part of their
research on example-based machine translation.
Considering the fact that the alignment task is
essentially a semantic annotation task, we may
also compare our results to other tasks in seman-
tic corpus annotation. For example, we may con-
sider the methods for resolving annotation con-
flicts and the figures for inter-annotator agreement
in frame-semantic annotation as found in the Ger-
man SALSA project (cf. (Burchardt et al., 2006)).

4 Our Alignment Guidelines
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996488">
We have compiled alignment guidelines for word
and phrase alignment between annotated syntax
trees. The guidelines consist of general principles,
concrete rules and guiding principles.
The most important general principles are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999281">
1. Align items that can be re-used as units in a
machine translation system.
2. Align as many items (i.e. words and phrases)
as possible.
3. Align as close as possible to the tokens.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999379">
The first principle is central to our work. It
defines the general perspective for our alignment.

<figureCaption confidence="0.999674">
Figure 1: Tree pair German-English with word and phrase alignments.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935346153846">
We do not want to know which part of a sentence
has possibly given rise to which part of the cor-
respondence sentence. Instead our perspective is
on whether a phrase pair is general enough to be
re-used as translation unit in a machine translation
system. For example, we do not want to align die
Verwunderung ¨uber das Leben with their astonish-
ment at the world although these two phrases were
certainly triggered by the same phrase in the orig-
inal and both have a similar function in the two
corresponding sentences. These two phrases seen
in isolation are too far apart in meaning to license
their re-use. We are looking for correspondences
like was f¨ur eine seltsame Welt and what an ex-
traordinary world which would make for a good
translation in many other contexts.
Some special rules follow from this principle.
For example, we have decided that a pronoun in
one language shall never be aligned with a full
noun in the other, since such a pair is not directly
useful in a machine translation system.
Principles 2 and 3 are more technical. Princi-
ple 2 tells our annotators that alignment should be
exhaustive. We want to re-use as much as pos-
sible from the treebank, so we have to look for
as many alignments as possible. And principle 3
says that in case of doubt the alignment should go
to the node that is closest to the terminals. For
example, our German treebank guidelines require
a multi-word proper noun to first be grouped in
a PN phrase which is a daughter node of a noun
phrase [[Sofie Amundsen]PN ]NP whereas
the English guidelines only require the NP node
[Sophie Amundsen]NP. When we align the
two names, principle 3 tells us to draw the align-
ment line between the German PN node and the
English NP node since the PN node is closer to the
tokens than the German NP node.
Often we are confronted with phrases that are
not exact translation correspondences but approx-
imate translation correspondences. Consider the
phrases mehr als eine Maschine and more than a
piece ofhardware. This pair does not represent the
closest possible translation but it represents a pos-
sible translation in many contexts. In a way we
could classify this pair as the “second-best” trans-
lation. To allow for such distinctions we provide
our annotators with a choice between exact transla-
tion correspondences and approximate correspon-
dences. We also use the term fuzzy correspon-
dence to refer to and give an intuitive picture of
these approximate correspondences. The option to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994179">
53
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990965">
distinguish between different alignment strengths
sounded very attractive at the start but it turned out
to be the source for some headaches later. Where
and how can we draw the line between exact and
fuzzy translation correspondences?
We have formulated some clear-cut rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990702777777778">
1. If an acronym is to be aligned with a spelled-
out term, it is always an approximate align-
ment. For example, in our economy reports
the English acronym PT stands for Power
Technology and is aligned to the German En-
ergietechnik as a fuzzy correspondence.
2. Proper names shall be aligned as exact align-
ments (even if they are spelled differently
across languages; e.g. Sofie vs. Sophie).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995845241379311">
But many open questions persist. Is einer der
ersten Tage im Mai an exact or rather a fuzzy trans-
lation correspondence of early May? We decided
that it is not an exact correspondence. How shall
we handle zu dieser Jahreszeit vs. at this time of
the year where a literal translation would be in this
season? We decided that the former is still an exact
correspondence. These examples illustrate the dif-
ficulties that make us wonder how useful the dis-
tinction between exact and approximate translation
correspondence really is.
Automatically ensuring the overall consistency
of the alignment decisions is a difficult task.
But we have used a tool to ensure the consis-
tency within the exact and approximate alignment
classes. The tool computes the token span for each
alignment and checks if the same tokens pairs have
always received the same alignment type. For ex-
ample, if the phrase pair mit einer blitzschnellen
Bewegung and with a lightning movement is once
annotated as exact alignment, then it should always
be annotated as exact alignment. Figure 1 shows
approximate alignments between the PPs in der
Hand and in her hand. It was classified as approxi-
mate rather than exact alignment since the German
PP lacks the possessive determiner.
Currently our alignment guidelines are 6 pages
long with examples for English-German and
English-Swedish alignments.

5 Experiments with Student Annotators
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999600018518519">
In order to check the inter-annotator agreement for
the alignment task we performed the following ex-
periment. We gave 20 tree pairs in German and
English to 12 advanced undergraduate students in
a class on ”Machine Translation and Parallel Cor-
pora”. Half of the tree pairs were taken from our
Sophie’s World treebank and the other half from
our Economy treebank. We made sure that there
was one 1:2 sentence alignment in the sample. The
students did not have access to the Gold Standard
alignment.
In class we demonstrated the alignment tool to
the students and we introduced the general align-
ment principles to them. Then the students were
given a copy of the alignment guidelines. We
asked them to do the alignments independently of
each other and to the best of their knowledge ac-
cording to the guidelines.
In our own annotation of the 20 tree pairs (= the
Gold Standard alignment) we have the following
numbers of alignments:
type exact fuzzy total
Sophie part word 75 3 78
phrase 46 12 58
Economy part word 159 19 178
phrase 62 9 71
In the Sophie part of the experiment treebank we
have 78 word-to-word alignments and 58 phrase-
to-phrase alignments. Note that some phrases con-
sist only of one word and thus the same alignment
information is represented twice. We have deliber-
ately kept this redundancy.
The alignments in the Sophie part consist of
125 times 1:1 alignments, 4 times 1:2 alignments
and one 1:3 alignment (w¨are vs. would have been)
when viewed from the German side. There are 3
times 1:2 alignments (e.g. introducing vs. stellte
vor) and no other 1:many alignment when viewed
from the English side.
In the Economy part the picture is similar. The
vast majority are 1:1 alignments. There are 207
times 1:1 alignments and 21 times 1:2 alignments
(many of which are German compound nouns)
when viewed from German. And there are 235
times 1:1 alignments, plus 4 times 1:2 alignments,
plus 2 times 1:3 alignments when viewed from
English (e.g. the Americas was aligned to the three
tokens Nord- und S¨udamerika).
The student alignments showed a huge vari-
ety in terms of numbers of alignments. In the
Sophie part they ranged from 125 alignments to
bare 47 alignments (exact alignments and fuzzy
alignments taken together). In the Economy part
the variation was between 259 and 62 alignments.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996215">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996925">
On closer inspection we found that the student
with the lowest numbers works as a translator
and chose to use a very strict criterion of transla-
tion equivalence rather than translation correspon-
dence. Three other students at the end of the list are
not native speakers of either German and English.
We therefore decided to exclude these 4 students
from the following comparison.
The student alignments allow for the investiga-
tion of a number of interesting questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967087647058824">
1. How did the students’ alignments differ from
the Gold Standard?
2. Which were the alignments done by all stu-
dents?
3. Which were the alignments done by single
students only?
4. Which alignments varied most between exact
and fuzzy alignment?
When we compared each student’s alignments
to the Gold Standard alignments, we computed
three figures:
1. How often did the student alignment and the
Gold Standard alignment overlap?
2. How many Gold Standard alignments did the
student miss?
3. How many student alignments were not in the
Gold Standard?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926071428571">
The remaining 8 students reached between 81%
and 48% overlap with the Gold Standard on the
Sophie part, and between 89% and 66% overlap
with the Gold Standard on the Economy texts. This
can be regarded as their recall values if we assume
that the Gold Standard represents the correct align-
ments. These same 8 students additionally had
between 2 and 22 own alignments in the Sophie
part and between 12 and 55 own alignments in the
Economy part.
So the interesting question is: What kind of
alignments have they missed, and which were
the additional own alignments that they suggested
(alignments that are not in the gold standard)? We
first checked the students with the highest numbers
of own alignments. We found that some of these
alignments were due to the fact that students had
ignored the rule to align as close to the tokens as
possible (principle 3 above).
Another reason was that students sometimes
aligned a word (or some words) with a node.
For example, one student had aligned the word
nat¨urlich to the phrase of course instead of to the
word sequence of course. Our alignment tool al-
lows that, but the alignment guidelines discour-
age such alignments. There might be exceptional
cases where a word-to-phrase alignment is neces-
sary in order to keep valuable information, but in
general we try to stick to word-to-word and phrase-
to-phrase alignments.
Another discrepancy occurred when the stu-
dents aligned a German verb group with a single
verb form in English (e.g. ist zur¨uckzuf¨uhren vs.
reflecting). We have decided to only align the full
verb to the full verb (independent of the inflection).
This means that we align only zur¨uckzuf¨uhren to
reflecting in this example.
The uncertainties on how to deal with different
grammatical forms led to the most discrepancies.
Shall we align the definite NP die Ums¨atze with
the indefinite NP revenues since it is much more
common to drop the article in an English plural NP
than in German? Shall we align a German genitive
NP with an of-PP in English (der beiden Divisio-
nen vs. of the two divisions)? We have decided to
give priority to form over function and thus to align
the NP der beiden Divisionen with the NP the two
divisions. But of course this choice is debatable.
When we compute the intersection of the align-
ments done by all students (ignoring the difference
between exact and fuzzy alignments), we find that
about 50% of the alignments done by the student
with the smallest number of alignments is shared
by all other students. All of the alignments in the
intersection are in our Gold Standard file. This in-
dicates that there is a core of alignments that are
obvious and uncontroversial. Most of them are
word alignments.
When we compute the union of the alignments
done by all students (again ignoring the difference
between exact and fuzzy alignments), we find that
the number of alignments in the union is 40% to
50% higher than the number of alignments done by
the student with the highest number of alignments.
It is also about 40% to 50% higher than the number
of alignments in the Gold Standard. This means
that there is considerable deviation from the Gold
Standard.
Comparing the union of the students’ align-
ments to the Gold Standard points to some weak-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995101">
55
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999714190476191">
nesses of the guidelines. For example, one align-
ment in the Gold Standard that was missed by all
students concerns the alignment of a German pro-
noun (wenn sie die Hand ausstreckte) to an empty
token in English (herself shaking hands). Our
guidelines recommend to align such cases as fuzzy
alignments, but of course it is difficult to determine
that the empty token really corresponds to the Ger-
man word.
Other discrepancies concern cases of differing
grammatical forms, e.g. a German definite singu-
lar noun phrase (die Hand) that was aligned to an
English plural noun phrase (Hands) in the Gold
Standard but missed by all students. Finally there
are a few cases where obvious noun phrase cor-
respondences were simply overlooked by all stu-
dents (sich - herself) although the tokens them-
selves were aligned. Such cases should be handled
by an automated process in the alignment tool that
projects from aligned tokens to their mother nodes
(in particular in cases of single token phrases).
We also investigated how many exact align-
ments and how many fuzzy alignments the stu-
dents had used. The following table gives the fig-
ures.
exact fuzzy overlap total
Sophie part 152 106 69 189
Economy part 296 188 119 366
The alignments done by all students resulted in a
union set of 189 alignments for the Sophie part and
366 alignments for the Economy part. The align-
ments in the Sophie part consisted of 152 exact
alignments and 106 fuzzy alignments. This means
that 69 alignments were marked as both exact and
fuzzy. In other words, in 69 cases at least one stu-
dent has marked an alignment as fuzzy while at
least one other student has marked the same align-
ment as good. So there is still considerable con-
fusion amongst the annotators on how to decide
between exact and fuzzy alignments. And in case
of doubt many students have decided in favor of
fuzzy alignments.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999845625">
We have shown the difficulties in creating cross-
language word and phrase alignments. Experi-
ments with a group of students have helped to iden-
tify the weaknesses in our alignment guidelines
and in our Gold Standard alignment. We have re-
alized that the guidelines need to contain a host
of fine-grained alignment rules and examples that
will clarify critical cases.
In order to evaluate a set of alignment experi-
ments with groups of annotators it is important to
have good visualization tools to present the results.
We have worked with Perl scripts for the compar-
ison and with our own TreeAligner tool for the vi-
sualization. For example we have used two colors
to visualize a student’s alignment overlap with the
Gold Standard in one color and his own alignments
(that are not in the Gold Standard) in another color.
In order to visualize the agreements of the whole
group it would be desirable to have the option to in-
crease the alignment line width in proportion to the
number of annotators that have chosen a particular
alignment link. This would give an intuitive im-
pression of strong alignment links and weak align-
ment links.
Another option for future extension of this work
is an even more elaborate classification of the
alignment links. (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006) have
demonstrated how a fine-grained distinction be-
tween different alignment types could look like.
Annotating such a corpus will be labor-intensive
but provide for a wealth of cross-language obser-
vations.

<abstract confidence="0.9987635">We have built a parallel treebank that includes word and phrase alignment. The alignment information was manually checked using a graphical tool that allows the annotator to view a pair of trees from parallel sentences. We found the compilation of clear alignment guidelines to be a difficult task. However, experiments with a group of students have shown that we are on the right track with up to 89% overlap between the student annotation and our own. At the same time these experiments have helped us to pin-point the weaknesses in the guidelines, many of which concerned unclear rules related to differences in grammatical forms between the languages.</abstract>
