Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9994388125">
Building machine translation (MT) for many
minority languages in the world is a serious
challenge. For many minor languages there is
little machine readable text, few knowledge-
able linguists, and little money available for
MT development. For these reasons, it be-
comes very important for an MT system to
make best use of its resources, both labeled
and unlabeled, in building a quality system.
In this paper we argue that traditional active
learning setup may not be the right fit for seek-
ing annotations required for building a Syn-
tax Based MT system for minority languages.
We posit that a relatively new variant of active
learning, Proactive Learning, is more suitable
for this task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999889448979592">
Speakers of minority languages could benefit from
fluent machine translation (MT) between their native
tongue and the dominant language of their region.
But scarcity in capital and know-how has largely
restricted machine translation to the dominant lan-
guages of first world nations. To lower the barriers
surrounding MT system creation, we must reduce
the time and resources needed to develop MT for
new language pairs. Syntax based MT has proven
to be a good choice for minority language scenario
(Lavie et al., 2003). While the amount of paral-
lel data required to build such systems is orders of
magnitude smaller than corresponding phrase based
statistical systems (Koehn et al., 2003), the variety
of linguistic annotation required is greater. Syntax
based MT systems require lexicons that provide cov-
erage for the target translations, synchronous gram-
mar rules that define the divergences in word-order
across the language-pair. In case of minority lan-
guages one can only expect to find meagre amount
of such data, if any. Building such resources effec-
tively, within a constrained budget, and deploying an
MT system is the need of the day.
We first consider ‘Active Learning’ (AL) as a
framework for building annotated data for the task
of MT. However, AL relies on unrealistic assump-
tions related to the annotation tasks. For instance,
AL assumes there is a unique omniscient oracle. In
MT, it is possible and more general to have multiple
sources of information with differing reliabilities or
areas of expertise. A literate bilingual speaker with
no extra training can produce translations for word,
phrase or sentences and even align them. But it re-
quires a trained linguist to produce syntactic parse
trees. AL also assumes that the single oracle is per-
fect, always providing a correct answer when re-
quested. In reality, an oracle (human or machine)
may be incorrect (fallible) with a probability that
should be a function of the difficulty of the question.
There is also no notion of cost associated with the
annotation task, that varies across the input space.
But in MT, it is easy to see that length of a sentence
and cost of translation are superlinear. Also not all
annotation tasks for MT have the same level of dif-
ficulty or cost. For example, it is relatively cheap
to ask a bilingual speaker whether a word, phrase
or sentence was correctly translated by the system,
but a bit more expensive to ask for a correction. As-
sumptions like these render active learning unsuit-

2 Syntax Based Machine Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987">
In recent years, corpus based approaches to ma-
chine translation have become predominant, with
Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-
SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) being the most ac-
tively progressing area. Recent research in syn-
tax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight,
2001; Chiang, 2005) incorporates syntactic informa-
tion to ameliorate the reordering problem faced by
PB-SMT approaches. While traditional approaches
to syntax based MT were dependent on availabil-
ity of manual grammar, more recent approaches op-
erate within the resources of PB-SMT and induce
hierarchical or linguistic grammars from existing
phrasal units, to provide better generality and struc-
ture for reordering (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chi-
ang, 2005; Wu, 1997).

2.1 Resources for Syntax MT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999525904761905">
Syntax based approaches to MT seek to leverage the
structure of natural language to automatically induce
MT systems. Depending upon the MT system and
the paradigm, the resource requirements may vary
and could also include modules such as morpholog-
ical analyzers, sense disambiguation modules, gen-
erators etc. A detailed discussion of the comprehen-
sive pipeline, may be out of the scope of this pa-
per, more so because such resources can not be ex-
pected in a low-resource language scenario. We only
focus on the quintessential set of modules for MT
pipeline - data acquisition, word-alignment, syntac-
tic analysis etc. The resources can broadly be cat-
egorized as ‘monolingual’ vs ‘bilingual’ depending
upon whether it requires knowledge in one language
or both languages for annotation. A sample of the
different kinds of data and annotation that is ex-
pected by an MT system is shown below. Each of
the additional information can be seen as extra an-
notations for the ‘Source’ sentence. The language
of target in the example is ‘Hindi’.

3 Active Learning for MT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999673764705883">
Modern syntax based MT rides on the success of
both Statistical Machine Translation and Statistical
Parsing. Active learning has been applied to Statis-
tical Parsing (Hwa, 2004; Baldridge and Osborne,
2003) to improve sample selection for manual anno-
tation. In case of MT, active learning has remained
largely unexplored. Some attempts include training
multiple statistical MT systems on varying amounts
of data, and exploring a committee based selection
for re-ranking the data to be translated and included
for re-training. But this does not apply to training in
a low-resource scenario where data is scarce.
In the rest of the section we discuss the different
scenarios that arise in gathering of annotation for
MT under a traditional ‘active learning’ setup and
discuss the characteristics of the task that render it
difficult.

For each of the sub-tasks of annotation, in reality
we have multiple sources of information or multi-

of the languages. With the success of collabora-

can provide the task of annotation to multiple ora-
cles on the internet (Snow et al., 2008). The task
of word alignment can be posed in a similar fash-
ion too. More interestingly, there are statistical tools
like GIZA 2 that take as input un-annotated paral-
lel data and propose automatic correspondences be-
tween words in the language-pair, giving scope to
‘machine oracles’.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99999">
3.2 Varying Quality and Reliability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999346">
Oracles also vary on the correctness of the answers
they provide (quality) as well as their availability
(robustness) to answer. One typical distinction is
‘human oracles’ vs ‘machine oracles’. Human or-
acle produce higher quality annotations when com-
pared to a machine oracle. We would prefer a tree
bank of parse trees that were manually created over
automatically generated tree banks. Similar is the
case with word-alignment and other tasks of trans-
lation. Some oracles are ‘reluctant’ to produce an
output, for example parsers tend to break on really
long sentences, but when they produce an output
we can associate some confidence with it about the
quality. One can expect a human oracle to produce
parse trees for long sentences, but the quality could
be questionable.
but sometimes a tradeoff to make is cost vs qual-
ity. We can not afford to introduce a grammar rule
of low-quality into the system, but can possibly do
away with an incorrect word-correspondence link.

4 Proactive Learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999765533333333">
Proactive learning (Donmez and Carbonell, 2008) is
a generalization of active learning designed to re-
lax unrealistic assumptions and thereby reach prac-
tical applications. Active learning seeks to select the
most informative unlabeled instances and ask an om-
niscient oracle for their labels, so as to retrain the
learning algorithm maximizing accuracy. However,
the oracle is assumed to be infallible (never wrong),
indefatigable (always answers), individual (only one
oracle), and insensitive to costs (always free or al-
ways charges the same). Proactive learning relaxes
all these four assumptions, relying on a decision-
theoretic approach to jointly select the optimal or-
acle and instance, by casting the problem as a utility
optimization problem subject to a budget constraint.

Each of the annotation tasks has a non-uniform cost
associated with it, the distribution of which is de-
pendent upon the difficulty over the input space.
Clearly, length of the sentence is a good indicator of
the cost. It takes much longer to translate a sentence
of 100 words than to translate one with 10 words. It
takes at least twice as long to create word-alignment
correspondences for a sentence-pair with 40 tokens
than a pair with 20 tokens. Similarly, a human takes
much longer to manually create parse tree for a long
sentence than a short sentence.
It is also the case that not all oracles have the
same non-uniform cost distribution over the input
space. Some oracles are more expensive than the
others. For example a practicing linguist’s time is
perhaps costlier than that of an undergraduate who
is a bilingual speaker. As noticed above, this may
reflect upon the quality of annotation for the task,

The above equation can be interpreted as maximiz-
ing the expected value of labeling the input set 5
under the budget constraint B. The subscript k de-
notes the oracle from which the answer was elicited
under a cost function C. A greedy approximation of
the above results in the equation 1, where Ek[V (x)]
is the expected value of information of the example
x corresponding to oracle k. One can design inter-
esting functions that calculate V (x) in case of MT.
For example, selecting short sentences with an unre-
solved linguistic issue could maximize the utility of
the data at a low cost.

We now turn to how proactive learning framework
helps solve the issues raised for active learning in
MT in section 3. We can address the issue of multi-
ple oracles where one oracle is fallible or reluctant to
answer, by factoring into Equation 2 its probability

function for returning an answer. The score returned
by such a factoring can be called the utility associ-
ated with that input for a particular oracle. We call
this U(x, k). A similar factorization can be done in
order to address the issue of oracles that are fallible.

Since we do not have the P(ans/x, k) distribu-
tion information for each oracle, proactive learning
proposes to discover this in a discovery phase under
some allocated budget Bd. Once we have an esti-
mate from the discovery phase, the rest of the label-
ing proceeds according to the optimization function.
For more details of the algorithms refer (Donmez
and Carbonell, 2008). Finally, we can also relax the
assumption of uniform cost per annotation, but re-
placing the Ck term in the above equations with a
Cnon−unifk function denoting the non-uniform cost
function associated with the oracle.

5 Future Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999153722222222">
While proactive learning is a good framework for
building MT systems for minority languages, there
are however a few issues that still remain that need
careful attention.
Joint Utility: In a complex system like MT where
different models combine forces to produce the
translation we have a situation where we need to op-
timize not only for an input and the oracle, but also
the kind of annotation we would like to elicit. For
example given a particular translation model, we do
not know if the most optimal thing at a given point is
to seek more word-alignment annotation from a par-
ticular ’alignment oracle’ or seek parse annotation
from a ’parsing oracle’.
Machine oracles vs Human oracles: The assump-
tion with an oracle is that the knowledge and exper-
tise of the oracle does not change over the course of
annotation. We do not assume that the oracle learns
over time and hence the speed of annotation or per-
haps the accuracy of annotation increases. This is
however very common with ’machine oracles’. For
example, an oracle that suggests automatic align-
ment of data using statistical concordances may ini-
tially be unreliable due to the less amount of data it is
trained on, but as it receives more data, the estimates
get better and so the system gets more reliable.
Evaluation: Performance of underlying system is
typically done by well understood metrics like pre-
cision/recall. However, evaluation of MT output
is quite subjective and automatic evaluation met-
rics may be too coarse to distinguish the nuances
of translation. This becomes quite important in
an online active learning setup, where we add an-
notated data incrementally, and the immediately
trained translation models are not sufficient to make
a difference in the scores of the evaluation metric.

Each of the additional information can be seen as extra annotations for the ‘Source’ sentence. The language of target in the example is ‘Hindi’. • Source: John ate an apple • Target: John ne ek seb khaya • Alignment: (1,1),(2,5),(3,3),(4,4) • SourceParse: (S (NP (NNP John)) (VP (VBD ate) (NP (DT an) (NN apple)))) • Lexicon: (seb → apple),(ate → khaya) • Grammar: VP: V NP → NP V 3 Active Learning for MT Modern syntax based MT rides on the success of both Statistical Machine Translation and Statistical Parsing. Active learning has been applied to Statistical Parsing (Hwa, 2004; Baldridge and Osborne, 2003) to improve sample selection for manual annotation. In case of MT, active learning has remained largely unexplored. Some attempts include training multiple statistical MT systems on varying amounts of data, and exploring a committee based selection for re-ranking the data to be translated and included for re-training. But this does not apply to training in a low-resource scenario where data is scarce. In the rest of the section we discuss the different scenarios that arise in gathering of annotation for MT under a traditional ‘active learning’ setup and discuss th</context>

But scarcity in capital and know-how has largely restricted machine translation to the dominant languages of first world nations. To lower the barriers surrounding MT system creation, we must reduce the time and resources needed to develop MT for new language pairs. Syntax based MT has proven to be a good choice for minority language scenario (Lavie et al., 2003). While the amount of parallel data required to build such systems is orders of magnitude smaller than corresponding phrase based statistical systems (Koehn et al., 2003), the variety of linguistic annotation required is greater. Syntax based MT systems require lexicons that provide coverage for the target translations, synchronous grammar rules that define the divergences in word-order across the language-pair. In case of minority languages one can only expect to find meagre amount of such data, if any. Building such resources effectively, within a constrained budget, and deploying an MT system is the need of the day. We first consider ‘Active Learning’ (AL) as a framework for building annotated data for the task of MT. However, AL relies on unrealistic assum</context>

In Section 3 we first discuss active learning approaches for MT and detail the characteristics of MT for minority languages problem that render traditional active learning unsuitable for practical purposes. In Section 4 we discuss proactive learning as a potential solution for the current problem. We conclude with some challenges that still remain in applying proactive learning for MT. 2 Syntax Based Machine Translation In recent years, corpus based approaches to machine translation have become predominant, with Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) being the most actively progressing area. Recent research in syntax based machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) incorporates syntactic information to ameliorate the reordering problem faced by PB-SMT approaches. While traditional approaches to syntax based MT were dependent on availability of manual grammar, more recent approaches operate within the resources of PB-SMT and induce hierarchical or linguistic grammars from existing phrasal units, to provide better generality and structure for reordering (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Wu, 1997). 2.1 Resources for Sy</context>

Depending upon the MT system and the paradigm, the resource requirements may vary and could also include modules such as morphological analyzers, sense disambiguation modules, generators etc. A detailed discussion of the comprehensive pipeline, may be out of the scope of this paper, more so because such resources can not be expected in a low-resource language scenario.
