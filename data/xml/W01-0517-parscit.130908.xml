<bodyText confidence="0.999896586206897">
In this paper, we present a prosody generation
architecture based on K-ToBI (Korean Tone
and Break Index) representation.
ToBI is a multi-tier representation system
based on linguistic knowledge to transcribe
events in an utterance. The TTS system which
adopts ToBI as an intermediate representation
is known to exhibit higher flexibility, modu-
larity and domain/task portability compared
with the direct prosody generation TTS sys-
tems. However, the cost of corpus preparation
is very expensive for practical-level performance
because the ToBI labeled corpus has been man-
ually constructed by many prosody experts and
normally requires large amount of data for sta-
tistical prosody modeling.
Contrary to previous ToBI-based systems,
this paper proposes a new method which tran-
scribes the K-ToBI labels completely automat-
ically in Korean speech. We developed au-
tomatic corpus-based K-TOBI labeling tools
and prediction methods based on several lexico-
syntactic linguistic features for decision-tree in-
duction. We demonstrated the performance
of FO generation from automatically predicted
K-ToBI labels, and confirmed that the perfor-
mance is reasonably comparable with state-of-
the-art direct prosody generation methods and
previous TOBI-based methods.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9536738125">
For the past few years, a great deal of interests
have arisen in high quality text-to-speech (TTS)
systems (van Santen et al., 1997). One of the es-
sential problems in developing high quality TTS
* This research was partly supported by Hyundai Au-
tonet, Inc. and by BK21 program of Korea Ministry of
Education
f Currently visiting CSLI Stanford University
systems is to generate prosody from texts. The
prosody in the TTS system increases intelligi-
bility and naturalness of synthesized speech. In
general, prosody refers to certain properties of
the speech signal, such as audible changes in
pitch, loudness and syllable length. Its phys-
ical features are related to prosodic phrasing,
fundamental frequency, segmental duration and
energy of synthesized speech. In TTS systems
especially, prosodic phrasing and fundamental
frequency contour generation are the most im-
portant tasks to produce natural speech.
In order to produce high quality speech, sev-
eral methods have been devised so far. We
can classify fundamental frequency (FO) con-
tour generation according to level of represen-
tation in prosodic phenomena; that is, acoustic
level, perceptual level and linguistic level (Du-
toit, 1997). This paper is related to a model
using linguistic knowledge. Specifically, we deal
with prosodic phrasing and FO contour gener-
ation among several prosodic features using K-
ToBI labeling system. K-ToBI (Beckman and
Jun, 1998) is a Korean implementation of the
standard ToBI system.
Our approach has the following specific de-
sign goals:
1) The changes of intonation in Korean lan-
guage are very weak, so the K-ToBI labeling
system must be simpler than the other language
ToBI systems.
2)K-ToBI, as an intermediate representa-
tion, normally increases system-level modular-
ity, flexibility and domain/task portability, but
should be implemented with no performance
degradation.
3) Labeling ToBI on speech corpus is nor-
mally very laborious and time-consuming How-
ever, large portion of Korean speech is mainly
monotonous in intonation. Therefore, we can

obtained RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
of 34.8Hz and 0.62 correlation coefficient when
compared with originals on the test data, which
is a significant improvement compared to pre-
vious rule-driven methods. They applied the
same technique to J-ToBI (Japanese ToBI) and
obtained RMSE of 20.9Hz and 0.70 correlation
coefficient (Black and Hunt, 1996). However,
these methods require massive amounts of man-
ually constructed ToBI labeled corpus. In this
paper we propose an automatic K-ToBI tone la-
bel prediction method without using manually
constructed ToBI corpus while achieving same
level of performance.
(Ross, 1995) proposed a model that predicts
the ToBI label and fundamental frequency us-
ing CART-based probability tree with Markov
sequence assumption. The method predicted
ToBI labels including accent location, symbolic
tones and relative prominence level from a text
tagged with part-of-speech (POS) labels and
marked for the prosodic constituent structure,
and showed an accuracy of prediction about
80% at the pitch accent type and about 67%
at the boundary tone type. For fundamental
frequency and energy generation, they obtained
RMSE of 34.74% and 3.48% respectively. The
merit of this approach was that the parame-
ters can be automatically estimated from la-
beled speech, but the system only predicted the
abstract prosodic label instead of the original
ToBI label. Furthermore, because the training
data was so small, the results could not be ex-
tended to general cases. We will predict tone
labels using not only linguistic knowledge but
also pitch values extracted from large amount
of speech and transcription files.
(Lee et al., 1998) proposed a method of K-
ToBI labeling from POS tagged texts and gen-
erated an fundamental frequency contour from
the K-ToBI-labeled corpus using the method
similar to (Black and Hunt, 1996). They showed
accuracy of 77.2% for IP boundary and 72% for
AP boundary prediction, and obtained RMSE
of 23.5Hz and 0.55 correlation coefficient for
fundamental frequency contour generation.
(Lee, 2000) proposed a tree-based prosody
modeling by appling bootstrap aggregating and
born again tree techniques proposed in the
statistics community to predict the prosodic
components more accurately. He applied not
only morphological knowledge but also syntax-
based features to predict K-ToBI tone label and
generating fundamental frequency contour. The
performance was RMSE of 35.65Hz and 0.729
correlation coefficient.
However all the previous approaches still suf-
fer from data sparseness problem due to manual
labeling of prosody data. We try to avoid such
problem by using a more general and simplified
method of prosodic phrasing and fundamental
frequency generation using a large sized, but au-
tomatically K-ToBI-labeled corpus.

3.1 Automatic K-ToBI tone labeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974228571429">
Because K-ToBI tone implies a variety of lin-
guistic knowledge and changes in intonation,
such as the fundamental frequency contour, it
is an important part of TTS systems. How-
ever, constructing the K-ToBI labeled corpora
is very difficult and time consuming because
they are usually constructed by some experts
who have phonological knowledge by referring
to pitch contours while hearing a speech corpus.
In addition, such manually constructed corpora
can lack consistency due to the differences be-
tween annotators. However, predicting K-ToBI
tone labels using a statistical method inevitably
requires a large corpus. Alternatively, in this
section, we propose an automatic method of
building and refining large corpus for K-ToBI
labeling. Figure 2 shows the whole flow of our
automatic K-ToBI tone labeling process.
First, we extract pitches from a speech data
and align the speech with its phone scripts
that have been manually corrected. Second,
we align the phone scripts with the extracted
pitches. Third, the phone sequence that has
been aligned with the pitches is segmented into
phrases by comparing with the phrase indices.
Using the above sequences, we can obtain a cor-
pus that was aligned with time and segmented
into prosodic phrases. Finally, we calculate
the max, min and average values of pitch se-
quences in each prosodic phrase, which would
become criteria that assign the `L&apos; tone or the
&apos;H&apos; tone. Since humans have a limited percep-
tion of changes in intonation, when we specify
ToBI symbols into syllable or IP boundary, am-
biguous regions naturally occur. We specify the

prosody are assigned to each syllable. There-
fore, we predict the K-ToBI tone label as &apos;H&apos;
tone or `L&apos; tone per syllable. We obtained
265,726 items of L tone and 121,322 items of
&apos;H&apos; tone automatically from the K-ToBI tone la-
beled corpus. We also used the same tree-based
method as IP tone prediction, but features for
the decision-tree are newly designed for best AP
label prediction as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962920032258065">
• NucleusPOS, CodaPOS: the POS of the
nucleus and coda respectively. Usually, the
POS of onset is the same as that of the nu-
cleus in Korean. Therefore, only two POS&apos;s
are used. The intonation of syllable is pre-
sumed to be related to the POS of the syl-
lable.
• SylType: the configuration type of each
syllable.
• LocinPhr: location of the current syllable
in a prosodic phrase. Usually, changes in
the &apos;H&apos; or `L&apos; tone are more active at the
second syllable in the prosodic phrase. We
assigned &apos;First&apos;, &apos;Second&apos; and &apos;Others&apos; to
this feature.
• LengthPhr: the length of the current
prosodic phrase. The short prosodic phrase
tends to be pronounced with &apos;H&apos; tone.
• SylPhrb, SylPhre: the distance from the
current syllable to the beginning or from
the end of current prosodic phrase. If
some absolute patterns exist in a prosodic
phrase, these features have some influence
on the decision of tones.
• RatioSylPhrb: the ratio of SylPhrb over
the length of the current phrase. This fea-
ture is useful for the decision of tones, if
there is a regular pattern in a prosodic
phrase.
3.4 Fundamental frequency contour
generation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993435">
In most synthesizers, the task of generating a
prosodic tone using ToBI label system consists
of two sub-tasks: the prediction of intonation
labels (AP tone and IP boundary tone in ToBI)
from input text (previously described), and the
generation of a fundamental frequency contour
from those labels and other information. We
used popular linear regression method to gener-
ate fundamental frequency from K-ToBI labels
(Black and Hunt, 1996). This method does not
require any other rules for label types, and is
general enough for many other languages. Our
prediction formula is as follows:
target = wi w2f2 ± • • • ± wr, fr, ± I
where L are the features that contribute to the
fundamental frequency, and we can decide the
weight w1 wr, and / through simple linear re-
gression. We applied the above formula to ev-
ery syllable and obtained a target value of the
fundamental frequency. We prepared pitch val-
ues extracted from a speech file, divided them
into five sections, and predicted the fundamen-
tal frequency at every point. The following fea-
tures overlap somewhat with features we devel-
oped for boundary and non-boundary tone pre-
diction, except some more features that, we an-
ticipate, would generate pitches.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998110052631579">
• SylStr: onset, nucleus, coda of pronuncia-
tion form at current syllable.
• LocinPhr: the location of the current syl-
lable in the prosodic phrase.
• Phrbndry: the type of boundary tone at
the preceding phrase. The pitch of the cur-
rent syllable is affected by the preceding
phrase boundary tone type.
• Toneseq: three preceding tones, one cur-
rent tone, and three following tones. If
some patterns of intonation of the prosodic
phrase exist, these features are useful.
• LengthPhr: the length of current prosodic
phrase.
• SylPhrb, SylPhre: the distance from the
current syllable to the beginning or to the
end of current prosodic phrases.
• RatioSylPhrb: the ratio of SylPhrb over
the length of the current phrase.

4.3 Fundamental frequency generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951480769231">
We predicted five pitch values for each syllable
and generate fundamental frequency with inter-
polated methods based on the predicted values.
We detected pitch values per 16ms from speech
with SFS tool (Huckvale, 1996). For training
and test, we extracted a feature set from an
automatically created file that is aligned with
pitch sequences and phone sequences. Further,
we eliminate items with &apos;0&apos; for pitch value as a
noise for the constructing model.
As described before, we used ten category and
four real value features to construct a linear re-
gression model. Since we extracted five pitches
from each syllable, we construct a linear regres-
sion model for each pitch, and obtained a total
of five models. Since the predicted response is a
vector, we compute the RMSE and correlation
coefficients for each element of the vectors and
averaged them. Table 6 shows the result of our
generation model with ToBI and its comparision
with direct generation without ToBI represen-
tation.
The table shows that ToBI-based generation
is surely competitive to the direct generation.
The result suggests that we can overcome the
performance deficiency caused by ToBI with au-
tomatically labeled large corpus for training es-
pecially for light tonal change languages, such
as Korean.
To compare with previous ToBI-based re-
sults, we used a relative measure called
&apos;Relative-MSE (mean squared error)&apos;, dividing
the previous RMSE by the standard deviation
of corpus. This relative measure can overcome
the differences between the features of the cor-
pus used in the model. According to the ta-
ble, (Black and Hunt, 1996)&apos;s original results
of 34.8Hz RMSE using linear regression model
is worse than our 22.2 Hz of RMSE results.
According to the new measure, (Ross and Os-
tendorf, 1999) obtained an RMSE of 34.74Hz,
with the standard deviation of corpus of 42.8Hz,
which gives 0.66 Relative-MSE similar to ours.
But their corpus was as short as 48 minutes
compared with our 1100 minutes.
For the Korean language, (Lee, 2000) ob-
tained an RMSE of 35.65Hz and the deviation
of the corpus is 50.74Hz. He obtained 0.49
Relative-MSE, which was better than our 0.66.
However, he used a small manually transcribed
K-ToBI corpus compared with our large auto-
matically labeled corpus.

the K-ToBI labels as an interim representation
of the prosody without performance degrada-
tion. As a result, the architecture of the TTS
system can have more flexibility and portability
by using the ToBI system, and the TTS system
can also be modularized. Another contribution
involves the automatic ToBI tone labeling tech-
niques used to construct a large size consistent
training and test corpora. Therefore, we solved
the problem that a ToBI-labeled corpus must be
manually constructed. As shown in our results,
the performance of prosody generation using the
K-ToBI system is competitive to those without
the ToBI system, and also competitive to the
previous state-of-the-art prosody generation re-
searches.
In the future, we have to automatically con-
struct dialog style ToBI labeled corpus to verify
our prediction model more thoroughly since cur-
rent MBCNEWSDB has biased tone labels be-
cause it is a reading corpus for broadcast news
scripts. A new algorithm from machine learn-
ing community especially to handle skewed and
biased training data will also be greatly helpful
to enhance the prediciton accuracy.

In order to produce high quality speech, several methods have been devised so far. We can classify fundamental frequency (FO) contour generation according to level of representation in prosodic phenomena; that is, acoustic level, perceptual level and linguistic level (Dutoit, 1997). This paper is related to a model using linguistic knowledge. Specifically, we deal with prosodic phrasing and FO contour generation among several prosodic features using KToBI labeling system. K-ToBI (Beckman and Jun, 1998) is a Korean implementation of the standard ToBI system. Our approach has the following specific design goals: 1) The changes of intonation in Korean language are very weak, so the K-ToBI labeling system must be simpler than the other language ToBI systems. 2)K-ToBI, as an intermediate representation, normally increases system-level modularity, flexibility and domain/task portability, but should be implemented with no performance degradation. 3) Labeling ToBI on speech corpus is normally very laborious and time-consuming However, large portion of Korean speech is mainly monotonous in intonatio</context>

They applied the same technique to J-ToBI (Japanese ToBI) and obtained RMSE of 20.9Hz and 0.70 correlation coefficient (Black and Hunt, 1996). However, these methods require massive amounts of manually constructed ToBI labeled corpus. In this paper we propose an automatic K-ToBI tone label prediction method without using manually constructed ToBI corpus while achieving same level of performance. (Ross, 1995) proposed a model that predicts the ToBI label and fundamental frequency using CART-based probability tree with Markov sequence assumption.

Furthermore, because the training data was so small, the results could not be extended to general cases. We will predict tone labels using not only linguistic knowledge but also pitch values extracted from large amount of speech and transcription files. (Lee et al., 1998) proposed a method of KToBI labeling from POS tagged texts and generated an fundamental frequency contour from the K-ToBI-labeled corpus using the method similar to (Black and Hunt, 1996). They showed accuracy of 77.2% for IP boundary and 72% for AP boundary prediction, and obtained RMSE of 23.5Hz and 0.55 correlation coefficient for fundamental frequency contour generation. (Lee, 2000) proposed a tree-based prosody modeling by appling bootstrap aggregating and born again tree techniques proposed in the statistics community to predict the prosodic components more accurately. He applied not only morphological knowledge but also syntaxbased features to predict K-ToBI tone label and generating fundamental frequency contour.

This feature is useful for the decision of tones, if there is a regular pattern in a prosodic phrase. 3.4 Fundamental frequency contour generation In most synthesizers, the task of generating a prosodic tone using ToBI label system consists of two sub-tasks: the prediction of intonation labels (AP tone and IP boundary tone in ToBI) from input text (previously described), and the generation of a fundamental frequency contour from those labels and other information. We used popular linear regression method to generate fundamental frequency from K-ToBI labels (Black and Hunt, 1996). This method does not require any other rules for label types, and is general enough for many other languages. Our prediction formula is as follows: target = wi w2f2 ± • • • ± wr, fr, ± I where L are the features that contribute to the fundamental frequency, and we can decide the weight w1 wr, and / through simple linear regression. We applied the above formula to every syllable and obtained a target value of the fundamental frequency. We prepared pitch values extracted from a speech file, divided them into five sections, and predicted the fundamental frequency at every point. The following f</context>

The result suggests that we can overcome the performance deficiency caused by ToBI with automatically labeled large corpus for training especially for light tonal change languages, such as Korean. To compare with previous ToBI-based results, we used a relative measure called &apos;Relative-MSE (mean squared error)&apos;, dividing the previous RMSE by the standard deviation of corpus. This relative measure can overcome the differences between the features of the corpus used in the model. According to the table, (Black and Hunt, 1996)&apos;s original results of 34.8Hz RMSE using linear regression model is worse than our 22.2 Hz of RMSE results. According to the new measure, (Ross and Ostendorf, 1999) obtained an RMSE of 34.74Hz, with the standard deviation of corpus of 42.8Hz, which gives 0.66 Relative-MSE similar to ours. But their corpus was as short as 48 minutes compared with our 1100 minutes. For the Korean language, (Lee, 2000) obtained an RMSE of 35.65Hz and the deviation of the corpus is 50.74Hz.

Further, we eliminate items with &apos;0&apos; for pitch value as a noise for the constructing model. As described before, we used ten category and four real value features to construct a linear regression model. Since we extracted five pitches from each syllable, we construct a linear regression model for each pitch, and obtained a total of five models.
