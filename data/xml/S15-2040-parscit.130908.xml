This paper describes Al-Bayan team participa-
tion in SemEval-2015 Task 3, Subtask A. Task
3 targets semantic solutions for answer selec-
tion in community question answering systems.
We propose a knowledge-based solution for
answer selection of Arabic questions, special-
ized for Islamic sciences. We build a Semantic
Interpreter to evaluate the semantic similarity
between Arabic question and answers using
our Quranic ontology of concepts. Using su-
pervised learning, we classify the candidate
answers according to their relevance to the
users questions. Results show that our system
achieves 74.53% accuracy which is compara-
ble to the other participating systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717866666667">
With the increase of the popularity of community
question answering (CQA) systems, answer selection
became more challenging. CQA systems are often
open for public to answer any questions with no re-
striction or review from field experts. This highlights
the importance of developing systems that automati-
cally detects the most relevant answers from the irrel-
evant ones. These systems might be open-domain or
closed-domain, causing a tradeoff between accuracy
and generality.
SemEval-2015 task 3 targets semantically oriented
solutions for answer selection in community question
answering data. We focus on Subtask A for the Ara-
bic language which provides questions and several
community answers from the Fatwa website1. The

<bodyText confidence="0.997572789473684">
goal is to classify each answer as: Direct, Related or
Irrelevant.
In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based an-
swer selection system for Arabic. We use our Quranic
ontology, enriched with Quran verses and Tafseer
books, to convert each question and its candidate an-
swers into weighted vectors of ontology concepts.
We use these vectors to compute a semantic similar-
ity score between the question and each candidate
answer. We also compute a keyword matching score
and feed the two scores into a decision tree classifier
which predicts how much the answer is related to the
question.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 shows some of the related work to the system.
Section 3 shows the details of the system architec-
ture. In Section 4, we show the results of the task
evaluation. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section
5.

Our work is related to prior work in both Quranic
research and Question Answer Selection systems.
(a) Quranic Research: Several studies have been
made to understand the Quranic text and extract
knowledge from it using computational linguistics.
Saad et al. (2009) proposed a simple methodology for
automatic extraction of concepts based on the Quran
in order to build an ontology. In (Saad et al., 2010),
they developed a framework for automated gener-
ation of Islamic knowledge concrete concepts that
exist in the holy Quran. Qurany (Abbas, 2009) builds

a Quran corpus augmented with a conceptual ontol-
ogy, taken from a recognized expert source ’Mushaf
Al Tajweed’. Quranic Arabic Corpus (Atwell et
al., 2011) also builds a Quranic ontology of con-
cepts based on the knowledge contained in traditional
sources of Quranic analysis, including the sayings
of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and the Tafseer
books. Khan et al. (2013) developed a simple ontol-
ogy for the Quran based on living creatures including
animals and birds that are mentioned in the Quran in
order to provide Quranic semantic search. AlMaayah
et al. (2014) proposed to develop a WordNet for the
Quran by building semantic connections between
words in order to achieve a better understanding of
the meanings of the Quranic words using traditional
Arabic dictionaries and a Quran ontology.
Other attempts for text-mining the Quran were
proposed such as: QurAna (Sharaf and Atwell,
2012) which is a corpus of the Quran annotated
with pronominal anaphora and QurSim (Sharaf and
Atwell, 2012) which is another corpus for extracting
the relations between Quran verses.

tempts have been proposed for Arabic Answer Se-
lection. In CLEF 2012, the Arabic language was
introduced for the first time for selecting answers to
questions from multiple answer choices of short Ara-
bic texts. Abouenour et al. (2012) proposed a system
based on distance density N-gram model and Arabic
WordNet expansion. Trigui et al. (2012) proposed
another system that used inference rules on the CLEF
background collection. However, those systems have
low accuracy, 0.21 and 0.19 respectively. In CLEF
2013, Al-QASIM system (Ezzeldin et al., 2013) was
proposed which focused on answer selection and val-
idation. This approach divided the task into 3 phases:
(i) Document analysis, (ii) locating questions and an-
swers and (iii) answer selection. The overall accuracy
of the system is 0.36.

The system architecture is shown in Figure 1. The

The question and the answers are preprocessed and
fed into the Semantic Interpreter. The Semantic Inter-
preter uses a Quranic ontology of concepts enriched
with Quran interpretation (Tafseer) books to build
an inverted index. The question is converted into a
weighted vector of concepts (qVect) and similarly the
candidate answer (aVect). A semantic relatedness
score and a keyword matching score are computed
and fed into a decision tree classifier which outputs
the label of the answer.

3.2 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974262642857143">
First, we apply morphological analysis on the Ara-
bic text to identify its structure and remove the un-
wanted words (stopwords). For this purpose, we use
MADA (Morphological Analysis and Disambigua-
tion for Arabic) (Habash et al., 2009) which is one
of the most accurate Arabic preprocessing toolkits.
MADA can derive extensive morphological and con-
textual information from raw Arabic text, and then
use this information for high-accuracy part-of-speech
tagging, diacritization, lemmatization, disambigua-
tion, stemming, and glossing in one step.
Each term in the input text is represented by its
stem and POS tag using Buckwalter transliteration
(Buckwalter, 2002). We identify the stopwords ac-

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987413">
3.3 Building the Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999766875">
We integrated the Quranic Corpus Ontology (Atwell
et al., 2011) and the Qurany Ontology (Abbas, 2009),
to form our Quranic conceptual ontology proposed
in (Abdelnasser et al., 2014). The Quranic Corpus
Ontology uses knowledge representation to define
the key concepts in the Quran, and shows the relation-
ships between these concepts using predicate logic.
The Qurany Ontology is a tree of concepts that in-
cludes all the abstract concepts covered in the Quran.
It is imported from ’Mushaf Al Tajweed’ list of top-
ics. This integration was difficult since we had to
resolve the overlapping between the two ontologies.
There were also some mistakes in the Qurany Con-
cept Tree. So, we had to manually revise the 1200
concepts and their verses.
The Holy Quran consists of 6236 verses. Each
verse has to be under at least one concept in our
Quranic ontology. After the previous integration pro-
cess, there were 621 verses without concepts, so we
added them under their most suitable concepts to
complete the ontology using a similarity measure
module. This module measures the similarity be-
tween classified and unclassified verses to determine
the concepts of unclassified verses. Now, our final
ontology contains 1217 leaf concepts and all verses
of the Quran. Under each concept in our ontology,
we save the related verses with their Tafseer, that is
used to build the inverted index. We use two Tafseer2
books: (Ibn-Kathir, 1370) and (Al-Jaza’iri, 1986),
which are two of the most traditional books used by
Islamic scholars. It is possible to add other books to
enrich our corpus data.

3.4 Building the Semantic Interpreter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998185142857143">
We use machine-learning techniques to build a Se-
mantic Interpreter using the Explicit Semantic Anal-
ysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) approach.
The Semantic Interpreter maps the input Arabic text
into a weighted vector of Quranic concepts.
For each leaf concept Ci, we construct a document
Di such that Di contains all the verses related to
</bodyText>

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998092">
this concept and their Tafseer. We used Lucene In-
dexer3 to build an inverted index on the constructed
documents where each term Tj is represented as a
weighted vector of concepts. Entries of this vector
are assigned weights using the TFIDF scheme which
quantifies the strength of association between terms
and concepts.
Any input query to the system can be represented
as a weighted vector of concepts by calculating the
mean of concept vectors of the query terms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950166">
3.5 Semantic Relatedness Score
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
In order to evaluate the semantic relatedness between
two Arabic texts, we enter each text into the Seman-
tic Interpreter as a query. The Semantic Interpreter
represents each text as a weighted vector of concepts.
We compute the Cosine similarity between the two
weighted vectors which represents the semantic relat-
edness score. Therefore, if two texts are semantically
related, they will have similar weights for the same
concepts and consequently a high Cosine similarity
score, and vice versa.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98449">
3.6 Keyword Matching Score
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985777777778">
In this mechanism, the answers of a question are
weighted based on the matched words between the
answers and the question. For answer k and question
term j, 5corekj is the number of j repetitions in k
normalized by the maximum number of repetitions
of j in all answers. 5corek is the summation of
5corekj, (j = 1,.., n) where n is the number of the
question terms. Finally, we normalize all answers by
the maximum 5corek.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985606">
3.7 Answer Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957727272727">
We compute the semantic relatedness score and the
keyword matching score for each combination of
question and answer in the training data. The two
scores are normalized for each question. Now to
classify the answers as (Direct, Related, Irrelevant),
we train a decision tree classifier using the two nor-
malized scores with the gold-standard labels supplied
with the training data. The normalized scores are also
computed for the test data and the classifier predicts
the label of each answers. Results are shown in the
next section.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995779375">
In this paper, we proposed our system to automate
the process of Arabic answer selection in Community
Question Answering systems where candidate an-
swers are classified into answers that directly answer
the question vs. those that can be helpful vs. those
that are irrelevant. We constructed our knowledge-
based system using a Quranic semantic ontology and
the provided dataset in (M`arquez et al., 2015). The
system first applies some preprocessing tasks over
the question and answers, then a Semantic Interpreter
converts the preprocessed sentences into weighted
vectors of concepts. Using those vectors the system
calculates a semantic score for each answer, which is
fed, with an additional keyword matching score, into
a decision tree classifier. The system has an overall
accuracy of 74.53%.

Now, our final ontology contains 1217 leaf concepts and all verses of the Quran. Under each concept in our ontology, we save the related verses with their Tafseer, that is used to build the inverted index. We use two Tafseer2 books: (Ibn-Kathir, 1370) and (Al-Jaza’iri, 1986), which are two of the most traditional books used by Islamic scholars. It is possible to add other books to enrich our corpus data. 3.4 Building the Semantic Interpreter We use machine-learning techniques to build a Semantic Interpreter using the Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) approach. The Semantic Interpreter maps the input Arabic text into a weighted vector of Quranic concepts. For each leaf concept Ci, we construct a document Di such that Di contains all the verses related to 2Tafseer is the interpretation of the Quran. this concept and their Tafseer.

In CLEF 2012, the Arabic language was introduced for the first time for selecting answers to questions from multiple answer choices of short Arabic texts. Abouenour et al. (2012) proposed a system based on distance density N-gram model and Arabic WordNet expansion. Trigui et al. (2012) proposed another system that used inference rules on the CLEF background collection. However, those systems have low accuracy, 0.21 and 0.19 respectively. In CLEF 2013, Al-QASIM system (Ezzeldin et al., 2013) was proposed which focused on answer selection and validation. This approach divided the task into 3 phases: (i) Document analysis, (ii) locating questions and answers and (iii) answer selection.

The question is converted into a weighted vector of concepts (qVect) and similarly the candidate answer (aVect). A semantic relatedness score and a keyword matching score are computed and fed into a decision tree classifier which outputs the label of the answer. 3.2 Preprocessing First, we apply morphological analysis on the Arabic text to identify its structure and remove the unwanted words (stopwords). For this purpose, we use MADA (Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic) (Habash et al., 2009) which is one of the most accurate Arabic preprocessing toolkits. MADA can derive extensive morphological and contextual information from raw Arabic text, and then use this information for high-accuracy part-of-speech tagging, diacritization, lemmatization, disambiguation, stemming, and glossing in one step.
