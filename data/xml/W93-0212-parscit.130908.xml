The Sumerian proverb in the title is invoked by Julian Jaynes (1976) as he documents the laborious
process of coming to consciousness. This activity is the cognitive labor that enables us to arrive
at a question about the precise relationship between two types of knowledge, or ask if &amp;quot;rhetorical
relations [are] the realizations of intentions, or should . . . be discarded as simply a misconstrual
of intentions proper?&amp;quot; It is the legacy of that arrival we are discussing when we raise issues around
intentionality, and I do not think it is coincidental that the proverb quoted in Jaynes&apos; investigation
can be read in its English translation as being among the earliest evidence for a claim of a mental
state of intentionality: not only does the proverb demonstrate that we possess a state of awareness
about &amp;quot;how to live&amp;quot;, it also presents that consciousness as the instilling of action coincident with the
having of the mental state. The &amp;quot;god&amp;quot; whispers to the other half of the bicameral brain; the ability
to act lodged there responds as to a direct physiological stimulus. What is not quite so obvious
is that, as the presence of intention makes itself known, so do the effects of a necessary rhetorical
relationship. This paper takes the position that rhetorical knowledge is embedded in intentional
knowledge, and that the two can be said not merely to have a close relationship but to interact
demonstrably in a reflexive one.
The difficulty of dealing with intention vis-a-vis rhetorical relations rests first in making the as-
sumption that either or both exist and affect language use to greater or lesser degrees, as several
of the abstracts collected here debate. Of more concern for this discussion, however, seems to be
the acknowledgement at least tacit in most of the papers that extending language constructs into
language construction involves multiple levels of implication and/ or complex interweavings of ele-
ments. In short, we are having the present discussion because this second requirement arises from
our dealing with language in use, and not language as an object for analysis, as Sanders particularly
points out. Implicitly as well as explicitly we are assuming that our inquiries are about the operation
of language, and cannot be answered by a simple system indicating unidirectional (non-recursive)
coherence, nor in settling for a two-part classificaton of text as information and persuasion.
As a result, this contribution begins with an orientation toward language use as social action (Heap,
1989b) and seeks to account for intentions/rhetorical relations in natural language generation as a
matter of both the multiple goals of discourse (Kinneavy, 1980) and, dynamic character of language
use—shown, for example, in Conversation Analysis (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, 1974)—rather
than by description of linguistic objects. A major concern, then, is to understand language-use-as-

discourse both in action and as action, highlighting its resulting &amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot;. To begin to do so here,
I will examine the ways in which the proverb, an artefact of a much earlier world in which thinking
and acting had not been declared separate entities, is about the intentional state, and demonstrates
an embedded rhetorical relationship which is also its agency of intentional action.
First, let us accept a definition of &amp;quot;intentional&amp;quot; as being involved in cognitive activity based on wishes
and desires and proceeding through &amp;quot;directions of fit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;conditions of satisfaction&amp;quot; (Searle, 1983).
Such mental being is at the core of this Sumerian wisdom. The whisper of the god indicates having
the desire to act, the thinking; the reception or hearing, the understanding, of that whisper shows
the direction of fit by yielding advice to do something, in this case to &amp;quot;act&amp;quot;. Thus, the proverb
demonstrates conditions of satisfaction rising both from the injunction to promptness and from the
expected out-come---&amp;quot;make your god happy&amp;quot;. Taking the proverb as a text of the intentional state,
we can examine the function of the rhetorical relations tacit to the intentionality&apos;s existence as a
text..
For, putting forward claims about the function of rhetorical relations begins with a prior claim,
that intentionality possesses representation in itself. To speak or write in relation to the intentional
state is to deal in the representation of representation (Searle, 1983). We must be extremely careful
with the distinctions we make here, however. It is highly tempting to see representation as only
a container for &amp;quot;stateness&amp;quot;. Both communication theory based on &amp;quot;encoding&amp;quot; concepts and casual
location of speech acts as posterior to intention result in seeing language as somehow &amp;quot;representative
of&amp;quot;, with sets of signa acting as carriers, sent from a cognitive site through a conduit called text
(Frawley,1988). But in this proverb, we have a topic of cognitive relations echoed exactly in the
activity of the rhetorical ones: the thinking, understanding and acting of text production—inventing,
arranging, styling—are present as material relations of the thinking, understanding and acting present
as the substance of the proverb. Formulating a statement on &amp;quot;how to live&amp;quot; is not a message relayed
or translated, but an entry into an intentional state effected because there has been entry into an
intentional state. Entry is, quite simply, an action accompanied by a set of strategies for designing
behavior under material conditions—making semantic choices, applying the rules of syntax, choosing
formats and internal arrangements to create the objects we think of as documents and to render the
&amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot; we find in the rhetorical relations its text owns.
The conclusion approaching through the line of reasoning I am taking meshes with Searle&apos;s ob-
servation that the intentional state requires being able to be present as conditions (p. 23). These
conditions can take many forms—pronomenalizationjuxtaposition, paralleling, arranging as a string,
arranging as a block, turning into graphics. Doing so has created what is usually identified as the
relations of logic (Morrison, 1988) and customarily taken as the nature, and effect, of rhetorical
relations. But whether we identify them as expression, analysis, logic or any other category, consid-
ering these relations as a matter of intentional representation requires that we see them as design
for action. Making language choices and/or constructing a text is not a matter of realizing inten-
tionality, but of intentionality&apos;s being present, under conditions. Acts of design clean up &amp;quot;physical
messiness&amp;quot; as a matter of releasing the tacit into the explicit (Dennett, 1988). Intentionality and
rhetorical relations share a presence of active connection—thinking toward acting on the one hand,
and acting toward thinking on the other. Mutual support results, and also mutual dependence, or
reflexiveness: each is the set of conditions of the other being present, in the world.
And what, then, is the role of language? Since language consists of signa, it must be a representation—
at least in its semantic aspects—and, in turn, provides representation of the representation through

ordering it as grammar and syntax. But this is the aspect under which we study language-as-object,
not language-in-use, and tend to treat parole with the set of analytic devices applicable to langue
(Saussure, 1972). They are not, however, interchangable phases of the character of language, and
mixing them up tends to obviate the operation of language as a system of signs—that it provides
the grounds of and claims for representation through which we, quite simply, accomplish knowing
about (Addis, 1989). Thus, the formulation of intention and its presentation within the context
of discourse (Heap, 1989a) are both required to accomplish the work of the first major phase of
language-in-use, its &amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot;, in which intention and rhetoric reflexively generating the content
of discourse.
In addition, my own work with writing and speaking for scientific purposes has shown me that
intentional knowledge cannot be made fully to be present unless there is some accommodation for
mode of awareness: that is, what is represented is seldom of concern to the system of representing,
but how to represent, the mode, is crucial for purposive communicaton. That is, we cannot graft a
language sys tem onto intentionality, but we can employ its modality—iconic, indexical or symbolic
(Frawley, 1988)—as the agency for discourse relations (Burke, 1962). Taking into account the iconic,
visual character of language used in engineering design as the evidence of its rhetoric means taking
into account the direction of fit as evidenced in the language condition under which intentional states
appear phenomenonally (MNH, 1992). As Dennett notes, there is little evidence that the relationship
is syntactic (p.216), or even, I think, a &amp;quot;logical&amp;quot; one (MNH, 1991). We tend to accept descriptions
from linguistic science—those emphasizing logical relations as fundamental to having meaning—just
because syntax produces a phenomenon accounted logical (Morrison,1988) and seemingly consonant
with &amp;quot;arrangement&amp;quot;, the rhetorical relation most literally, and thus obviously, acting to order the
inchoate. More useful is the potential of Dennett&apos;s &amp;quot;economies&amp;quot; and other relational action that
introduces at least the possibility of recursiveness, as germane to the conditions of this or that
intentionality, both necessary and reflexive to int.tmtionality, and knowledge, being present at all.

To begin to do so here, I will examine the ways in which the proverb, an artefact of a much earlier world in which thinking and acting had not been declared separate entities, is about the intentional state, and demonstrates an embedded rhetorical relationship which is also its agency of intentional action. First, let us accept a definition of &amp;quot;intentional&amp;quot; as being involved in cognitive activity based on wishes and desires and proceeding through &amp;quot;directions of fit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;conditions of satisfaction&amp;quot; (Searle, 1983). Such mental being is at the core of this Sumerian wisdom. The whisper of the god indicates having the desire to act, the thinking; the reception or hearing, the understanding, of that whisper shows the direction of fit by yielding advice to do something, in this case to &amp;quot;act&amp;quot;. Thus, the proverb demonstrates conditions of satisfaction rising both from the injunction to promptness and from the expected out-come---&amp;quot;make your god happy&amp;quot;. Taking the proverb as a text of the intentional state, we can examine the function of the rhetorical relations tacit to the intentionality&apos;s existence as a text</context>

Mutual support results, and also mutual dependence, or reflexiveness: each is the set of conditions of the other being present, in the world. And what, then, is the role of language? Since language consists of signa, it must be a representation— at least in its semantic aspects—and, in turn, provides representation of the representation through 45 ordering it as grammar and syntax. But this is the aspect under which we study language-as-object, not language-in-use, and tend to treat parole with the set of analytic devices applicable to langue (Saussure, 1972). They are not, however, interchangable phases of the character of language, and mixing them up tends to obviate the operation of language as a system of signs—that it provides the grounds of and claims for representation through which we, quite simply, accomplish knowing about (Addis, 1989). Thus, the formulation of intention and its presentation within the context of discourse (Heap, 1989a) are both required to accomplish the work of the first major phase of language-in-use, its &amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot;, in which intention and rhetoric reflexively generating the content of discourse.
