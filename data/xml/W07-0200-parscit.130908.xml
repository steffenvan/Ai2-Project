Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of graph theory into Natural
Language Processing. In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a
graph and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-
based representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel
and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging, word sense
disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic role assignment, summarization and
sentiment analysis.
This volume contains papers accepted for presentation at the TextGraphs-2 2007 Workshop on Graph-
Based Algorithms for Natural Language Processing. This event took place on April 26, 2007,
in Rochester, NY, USA, immediately following the HLT-NAACL Human Language Technologies
Conference. It was the second workshop on this topic, building on the success of the first TextGraphs
workshop at HLT-NAACL 2006. The workshop aimed at bringing together researchers working on
problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for Natural Language Processing and on the
theory of graph-based methods. It addressed a broad spectrum of research areas to foster exchange
of ideas and help to identify principles of using the graph notions that go beyond an ad-hoc usage.
Unveiling these principles will give rise to applying generic graph methods to many new problems that
can be encoded in this framework.
We issued calls for both regular and short, late-breaking papers. In total, ten regular and three short
papers were accepted for presentation, considering the careful reviews of our program committee. We
are indebted to all program committee members for their thoughtful, high quality and elaborate reviews,
especially considering our extremely tight time frame for reviewing. The papers appearing in this
volume have surely benefited from their expert feedback.
This year’s workshop attracted papers employing graphs in a wide range of settings. While some
contributions focus on analyzing the structure of graphs induced by language data or the interaction of
processes on various levels, others use graphs as a means for data representation to solve NLP tasks,
sometimes involving transformations on the graph structure.
H. F. Witschel introduces a new graph based meta model for Information Retrieval that subsumes
many previous retrieval models and supports different forms of search. Improved unigram language
models by a smoothing technique that accounts for word similarities are constructed by B. Jedynak
and D. Karakos. Unsupervised grammar induction using latent semantics is the topic of A. M. Olney’s
research. V. Jijkoun and M. de Rijke view NLP tasks as graph transformations of labelled, directed
graphs and experiment with tasks involving syntax and semantics. Syntactic dependency trees as a basis
for semantic similarity are applied to textual entailment by D. Micol et al. D. Leite et al. find in their
graph-based automatic summarization experiments that linguistic knowledge is necessary to improve
automatic extracts. For multi-document summarization, evolving timestamped graphs are employed in
the contribution of Z. Lin and M.-Y. Kan. A graph for the extraction of patterns combined with an
extension of chance discovery is applied by C. S. Montero and K. Araki to human-computer dialogue
mining. The small-world and scale-free property of linguistic graphs that go in hand with power-law
distributions on entity and entity pair frequencies are examined in four papers: T. Zesch and I. Gurevych
analyze the article and category graph of Wikipedia and measure correlation with WordNet. R. Ferrer
i Cancho et al. find correlations in the organization of syntactic dependency networks for a wide range
of languages. Co-occurrence degree distributions are examined in a comparative study of Russian and
English by V. Kapustin and A. Jamsen. In the setting of spell checking, M. Choudhury et al. find
that spelling error probabilities for different languages are proportional to the average weighted degree
of the corresponding SpellNet. A transductive classification algorithm based on graph clustering is
described by K. Ganchev and F. Pereira, and tested on various NLP tasks.
Finally, having a prominent researcher as an invited speaker greatly contributes to the quality of the
workshop. We thank Andrew McCallum for his talk and for the support that his prompt acceptance
provided to the workshop.
