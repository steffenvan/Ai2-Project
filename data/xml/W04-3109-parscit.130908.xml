There is a great deal of interest in obtaining access to the vast stores of full-text literature held by
the various publishers. The need to balance a reduction of the restrictions on access with the
protection of the revenue streams of the publishers is critical. Without the publishers, the content
would not be available and support for several scientific societies would also disappear. On the
other hand, the value of the literature holdings, while it appears to be quite high, is not currently
adequately exploited. Text mining and more effective information retrieval is necessary to take
full advantage of the information captured by the millions of electronic journal articles currently
available.
The panel will discuss the issues involved in opening access to the literature holdings of the
publishers to both academic and corporate entities; it will also initiate conversations on effective
compromises.

Sample Questions:
1. How does loosening access restrictions on the full-text content endanger the publishing
revenue stream?
2. Why aren&apos;t the abstracting services sufficient to take advantage of the content?
3. In your opinion, does text mining extract all of the value from the content, obviating the need
for the content thereafter?
4. Can text mining help market journal content?
