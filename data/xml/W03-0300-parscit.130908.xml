This volume contains papers accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Building and
Using Parallel Texts: Data Driven Machine Translation and Beyond. This event took place on
May 31, 2003, in Edmonton, Canada, immediately following the HLT-NAACL Human Language
Technology Conference.
The workshop was centered around the problem of building and using parallel corpora, which
are vital resources for efficiently deriving multi-lingual text processing tools. We issued calls for
both regular and short, late–breaking papers. After careful review by our program committee, nine
regular papers and three short papers were accepted for presentation. We were truly impressed by
the high quality of the reviews provided by all the members of the program committee, particularly
since deadlines were very tight. All of the committee members provided timely and thoughtful
reviews, and the papers that appear have certainly benefited from that expert feedback.
Before the workshop, we conducted a comparative evaluation of word alignment techniques
that was open to anyone with a word alignment system and a bit of courage. English–French and
Romanian–English parallel text was made available to participants, and they had about two weeks
to develop or train their systems on this data. Then previously held out test data was released, and
participants had one week to submit word aligned versions of the test data to us for scoring. Seven
teams participated in the shared task, and each has a fully reviewed short paper in the proceedings
describing their system. In addition, there are two papers that present overall evaluations of the
exercise.
The shared task on word alignment would not have been possible without parallel text, and
there are quite a few people who deserve thanks for creating data that was a part of this task.
The English–French parallel text came to us from Franz Och, Herman Ney, and Ulrich German.
Franz and Herman kindly provided their word aligned English–French corpus, which served as our
gold standard in the English–French evaluation. The training data consisted of Ulrich Germann’s
freely available Aligned Hansards of the 36th Parliament of Canada (Release 2001-1a).
The Romanian–English gold standard data was created by a number of student volunteers from
the Department of English, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The training data
includes the freely available MULTEXT-East Romanian–English version of George Orwell’s novel
1984, as well as the Romanian Constitution and newspaper articles collected from the Internet.
Even with all that data, there would not have been a shared a task without participants. We give
our deepest thanks to the shared task participants, who took a leap of faith in allowing their systems
to be part of a comparative evaluation.
Finally, when we first started planning this workshop, we agreed that having a high quality
invited speaker was crucial. We nearly immediately realized that there would be no better choice
than Elliot Macklovitch, who has a wealth of experience working with parallel text. We were
pleasantly surprised when Elliot quickly and enthusiastically agreed to deliver the invited talk. We
thank him not only for his talk, but also for the boost of confidence his quick acceptance of our
invitation provided.
