<bodyText confidence="0.99992075">
This paper describes the University of Syd-
ney’s WSD and Lexical Substitution sys-
tems for SemEval-2007. These systems are
principally based on evaluating the substi-
tutability of potential synonyms in the con-
text of the target word. Substitutability is
measured using Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion as obtained from the Web1T corpus.
The WSD systems are supervised, while
the Lexical Substitution system is unsuper-
vised. The lexical sample sub-task also used
syntactic category information given from a
CCG-based parse to assist in verb disam-
biguation, while both WSD tasks also make
use of more traditional features.
These related systems participated in the
Coarse-Grained English All-Words WSD
task (task 7), the Lexical Substitution Task
(task 10) and the English Lexical Sample
WSD sub-task (task 17).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988038488372093">
This paper describes closely related systems that
were applied to three tasks of the SemEval-2007
workshop. The unifying characteristic of these sys-
tems is that they use the same measure of ‘substi-
tutability’ for a given word and a surrounding con-
text to perform the tasks. This measure is based
on frequencies involving the word and the context
from n-gram counts derived from one trillion words
of Web text.
These systems participated in the English Coarse-
Grained All Words and English Lexical Sample
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks, and in
the Lexical Substitution task.
The Lexical Substitution system relies entirely on
the substitutability measure to rank potential syn-
onyms, and only uses manual sense inventories to
preferentially select words which have been iden-
tified by lexicographers as being synonyms for the
original word in some contexts. It does not make use
of any machine learning, and is thus unsupervised.
The WSD systems are supervised, using a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) to learn from sense-
tagged examples of ambiguous words and predict
the class of the test instances. Classifiers for both
systems use a small number of additional feature
types beyond those derived from the n-gram counts,
including Bag of Words (BOW) and local context
features. A single separate model was trained for
each ambiguous lemma.
For verbs in the lexical sample, the classifier also
uses the syntactic category assigned to the target
verb by a parser as additional information for dis-
ambiguation.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows. Relevant background for the ideas employed
is briefly discussed, as is the nature of the Web1T
corpus. Descriptions of the particular systems used
for each of the tasks are described in ascending or-
der of task number. Details of particular sources of
information and the methods used to capture them
are introduced along with the task they are used in.
A presentation of results and discussion follows the

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992212">
Algorithms making use of unannotated data for
WSD and similar tasks are not particularly new.
One strategy which resembles the substitutability
technique employed by our systems is relatives-in-
context (Martinez et al., 2006), an unsupervised ap-
proach which uses a web search engine to find the
‘best’ match for the current context, according to
heuristic criteria. Monosemous relatives (Leacock
et al., 1998) increase the amount of training data
for supervised learners by recruiting the contexts of
synonyms in unannotated data, with the caveat that
those synonyms are not themselves ambiguous. As
substantial gold-standard data sets for lexical sub-
stitution have not previously been available, the Se-
mEval data presents a promising opportunity to ex-
amine the behaviour of our method.
Gomez (2001) argues that the syntactic roles of
ambiguous verbs in particular are interlinked with
their semantic class, and thus knowledge about the
syntactic function of a verb can provide information
to help identify its sense. Syntactic relationships
have been used to resolve ambiguity (Lin, 1997) and
a reduction of ambiguity has been shown to assist
in the acquisition of verb subcategorization frames
(Korhonen and Preiss, 2003).

3 The Substitutability Measure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968995829268293">
As an example to demonstrate the basic mechanism
underlying the measure of substitutability, consider
the sentence fragments around the verb ruled in:
the court ruled it was clear that
and
a republic ruled by the people
Two possible synonyms, pertaining to different
senses for the verb ruled, are found and governed.
It is clear that in a sufficiently large quantity of text,
the fragments:
the court found it was clear that
and
a republic governed by the people
would be substantially more common than the se-
quences:
the court governed it was clear that
or
a republic found by the people
and thus found should be considered more substi-
tutable in the context of the first fragment, and gov-
erned in the second.
Church et al. (1994) show that Pointwise Mutual
Information (PMI) is a suitable measure to capture
the degree to which a given word may substitute
for another; we have adopted PMI as the quantified
measure of substitutability in the systems used for
these tasks.
While previous WSD systems have made use of
counts obtained from Internet search engines, for
example Martinez et al. (2006), to our knowledge
WSD using corpus data at the scale of the Web1T
resource has not previously been published. Our
WSD systems combine our novel PMI-Web1T fea-
tures and CCG category features with additional fea-
tures described in the literature. While the Web1T
corpus consists only of counts, and thus is some-
what similar to the direct use of counts from Internet
search engines, it is also of a known size and thus
it is straightforward to determine useful quantities
such as PMI, and to exhaustively catalog potential
matches as for the lexical substitution task.

3.1 Web1T Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999609545454545">
The Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) is a
dataset consisting of the counts for n-grams obtained
from 1 trillion (1012) words of English Web text,
subject to a minimum occurrence threshold (200 in-
stances for unigrams, 40 for others). The Web1T
corpus contains counts for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams,
and is large enough to present serious processing dif-
ficulties: it is 25GB in compressed form.
The systems presented here thus use custom high-
performance software to extract only the n-gram
counts of interest from the Web1T data, includ-
ing simple wildcard pattern-matching. The scale of
the data rules out attempting to perform arbitrary
queries — even though the counts are lexicographi-
cally ordered, disk access times and decompression
overheads are severe, and case-insensitive queries
are not possible. This software will be released for
community use. A limitation in the implementation
is that the number of tokens that can be matched in
a wildcard expression is fixed at one. This limita-
tion precluded the testing of substitutability of multi-
word-expressions (MWEs) in the systems applied to

4 Task 7: Coarse Grained-English
All-Words WSD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998525862069">
The system for Coarse-Grained All-Words WSD
was supervised, but only attempted classification for
a subset of words. These words were chosen ac-
cording to the amount of sense-tagged training data
available, drawn from SemCor (Miller et al., 1993)
and the SenseEval-3 lexical sample (Mihalcea et al.,
2004) task. Features were extracted and a classifier
trained for each ambiguous content word that was
either present in the SenseEval-3 lexical sample, or
occurred at least 100 times in SemCor. These crite-
ria yielded classifiers for 183 words.
For ambiguous words without sufficient available
training data, the first sense baseline (determined
from WordNet version 2.1 (Fellbaum, 1998)) was
assigned to every instance. No manual augmentation
of the information from WordNet was performed.
For those words where models were being trained,
the sense clusterings provided by the task organis-
ers were used to completely unify all senses belong-
ing to a cluster, thus attempting disambiguation at
the level of the coarse senses. As the system does
not attempt to disambiguate words not selected for
modeling, the exclusion of the most frequent sense
(MFS) baseline would be likely to have a severe ad-
verse impact on this type of supervised approach.
Extension of the substitutability measure to directly
select a sense related to good substitutes, similar to
the approach outlined in Lin (1997) would be one
possible approach to resolve this consistently.
The classifier used for the system was an SVM
(libsvm) (Chang and Lin, 2001). Linear kernels
were used, as previous experiments using similar
features with other data sets for WSD had shown
that these kernels outperformed radial basis func-
tion and polynomial kernels; this disparity became
particularly pronounced with larger number of fea-
tures compared to training instances, and with the
combination of different feature types. The num-
ber of unique features for each lemma was, on av-
erage, more than an order of magnitude higher than
the number of training instances: 4475 compared to
289.
The features used to train the selected lemmas in-
cluded the substitutability measurement, all content
words within 3 sentences of the target, and imme-
diate local context features. These are detailed be-
low. There is no in-principle reason why CCG cate-
gory features used for the Lexical Sample task (see
Section 6.2) could not also be used for verbs in the
all-words task. Sentences containing target verbs
could have been selectively parsed and redundancy
among disambiguated running text in SemCor ex-
ploited. However, the system architecture was not
amenable to small modifications along these lines,
and time constraints prevented implementation be-
fore the close of the evaluation period. The impact
of this additional useful feature would be an inter-
esting subject for future study.

4.1 Features
4.1.1 Substitutability: Pointwise Mutual
Information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986692307693">
To transform the notion of substitutability into a
set of features suitable for WSD, a set of poten-
tial substitute words was chosen for each modeled
lemma. These words were taken from WordNet 2.1
(Fellbaum, 1998). For nouns, all synonyms, imme-
diate hypernyms and immediate hyponyms for all
senses were included. For verbs, synonyms for all
senses were used. The selection of potential sub-
stitutes was stricter for verbs as the number of syn-
onyms tended to be greater than for nouns, and these
criteria kept the number of substitutes manageable.
A sliding window was used to maximise the infor-
mation extracted from the Web1T corpus. All win-
dows at all sizes covered by the Web1T corpus that
included the target word were used to determine the
overall substitutability.
The counts of interest for determining the PMI for
a single substitute in a single window position in-
clude the unigram frequency of the substitute itself
the overall frequency of the context, irrespective of
the word in the target position; and crucially, the fre-
quency of the substitute in that context. For a given
substitute and context, an overall PMI is determined
as a single quantity, obtained by simply adding the
PMI together from each window position of each
size covered in the data:

#(sub + contextn,i)
log2 p(sub) · p(contextn,i) · Nn
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824714285714">
Here n represents the window size (varying from
2 to 5), i is the position within the window, and
Nn indicates the total number of n-grams present
in the corpus for a given value of n. Following
Church et al. (1994) the Maximum Likelihood Es-
timate (MLE) is used for both probabilities in the
denominator. p(sub) is estimated from the unigram
frequency of the substitute word, while p(context)
is derived from the counts of the context ignoring the
token in the target location.
Features were also created that harnessed the idea
that it is not only the level of substitutability for each
candidate word that is useful, but also that it may be
informative to recognise that some words are better
substitutes than others. This information was cap-
tured by adding additional features consisting of the
pairwise differences between PMI values for all can-
didate substitute words. To further draw the dif-
fering levels of substitutability into relief, features
representing the rank of each pair’s PMI difference
were also included.
Finally, each of the above feature types yields
real-valued features. Before being used in clas-
sification, these features were converted to binary
features using supervised Entropy-Based Discretisa-
tion (Fayyad and Irani, 1993). This process char-
acterises the partition selection as a message cod-
ing problem: the class labels in the training data
are a message to be encoded given that the value of
the feature is known for each instance, and the pro-
cess aims to minimise the length of that message.
This is achieved by recursively bifurcating each fea-
ture’s values at the partition point that would result
in the shortest message. Useful boundaries are those
where knowing which side of the partition the fea-
ture value falls on can be used to reduce the mes-
sage length beyond any increase required to specify
the partition. The algorithm terminates when the ex-
isting partitions cannot be divided further and still
satisfy this condition. If this occurs when attempt-
ing to find the first partition, the feature is dropped
altogether.

4.1.2 Bag of Words in broad context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999782">
Bag of words (BOW) features were introduced
to represent the presence or absence of almost all
words within a window of three sentences of the
target word. A small stop list (approximately 50
words) was used to remove common closed-class
words such as prepositions and conjunctions. The
words were lemmatised before being transformed
into features, and were not weighted for their dis-
tance from the target word. No attribute subset se-
lection was performed on the BOW features.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.472561">
4.1.3 Local Context Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9968928">
The sentence containing the target word was
tagged for Part of Speech (POS) using the POS tag-
ger in the C&amp;C parser tools. For four tokens either
side of the target lemma, features were formed from
the displacement of the token concatenated with:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999574">
• The POS tag
• The lemmatised word
• The POS and lemma together
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912">
Also included were features combining the above
information for pairs of tokens before, after, and ei-
ther side of the target word. Finally, a feature rep-
resenting the POS tag of the target word was added,
providing such information as number and tense.
The portion of the context used to form these fea-
tures is identical with that used to determine substi-
tutability of potential synonyms using the Web1T-
based features. Combining the abstract substi-
tutability features with features that use the particu-
lar tokens in the local context helps to maximise the
utility of information present near the target word by
approaching it from multiple perspectives.

5.1 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978735294118">
As for the WSD systems, the Lexical Substitution
system concentrated on words whose occurrence in
local contexts similar to that of the target was more
frequent than expected in the Web1T corpus.
Aside from preferring sets of potential syn-
onyms obtained from lexical resources, the system
is entirely unsupervised. Consequently, no sense-
annotated corpus resources were used.
The lexical resources used were WordNet ver-
sion 2.1 (Fellbaum, 1998) and the Macquarie The-
saurus (Bernard, 1985), a pre-defined, manually
constructed Thesaurus. The only information used
from these resources was a list of potential syn-
onyms for all listed senses that matched the target
word’s part-of-speech. These synonyms were used
to preferentially choose potential substitutes ob-
tained from the corpus data, as described below. The
union of potential synonyms from both resources
was used, although MWEs were not included due
to limitations with the corpus. Although these lex-
ical resources were not augmented, the system was
capable of producing substitutes not present in these
resources by using high-scoring words found in the
corpus. The ordering of synonyms in these resources
was not used directly, nor was their association with
particular senses.
The PMI for potential substitutes that occurred in
the target position of each local context window was
determined using the Web1T corpus, as for coarse
WSD above. The strategy differed slightly from the
supervised process employed for WSD however, in
that rather than testing a fixed set of potential substi-
tutes, every word that occurred in the correct loca-
tion in a matching context was considered as a sub-
stitute. This introduced an additional computational
burden which restricted the set of n-grams used to
4 and 5 grams. In particular, this is because the set
of words occurring in the target position grew pro-
hibitively large for 2 and 3 grams.
As for WSD, the PMI for each potential substi-
tute was combined by summing the individual PMIs
over all locations and size of n-gram where it oc-
curred. This sum was used to rank the substitutes.
After the production of the ranked list, the set of syn-
onyms obtained from the lexical resources was used
for preferential selection. Substitutes in the ranked
list that also occurred in the synonym pool were cho-
sen first. The exact manner of the preferential se-
lection differed for the two evaluation measures the
system participated in.
For the BEST measure, the highest PMI-ranked
substitute that occurred in the synonym pool was
given as the only substitute. If no substitutes from
the synonym pool were present in the ranked list,
the top three substitutes from the list were given.
For the out-of-ten (OOT) measure, the ten highest-
ranked substitutes that were in the synonym pool
were given. If fewer than 10 substitutes were present
in the list, the remaining best ranked substitutes not
in the synonym pool were used to make up the ten
answers.
As with the Coarse-Grained All Word WSD, lim-
itations in the current implementation of the Web1T
processing software meant that it was not possible
to examine MWEs, and there was thus no provision
to detect or handle MWEs in the system. For this
reason, the MW measure was not produced by the
system.

Notably, recall is always lower than precision. If
no substitutes were found to have finite PMI at any
position, no substitute was rendered by the system.
This meant a small number of examples in the sub-
mitted system had no answer provided. The sys-
tem’s design meant that no attempt was made to
provide any answer when counts were zero for all
Web1T queries. This was the case for around 3%
of the evaluation set. As the query retrieval soft-
ware was limited to single word substitutions, this
should be expected to occur for MWEs more fre-
quently than for single word substitutions. The re-
sults for both BEST and OOT confirm this, show-
ing that the system’s performance is uniformly better
when MWEs are excluded.
As a consequence of the properties of the Web1T
corpus, the system chooses substitutes on the ba-
sis of information that is derived from at most four
words either side of the target word. It is thus en-
couraging that it is able to outperform the baselines
on each evaluation measure.
Interestingly, for the BEST evaluation the perfor-
mance on the randomly selected (RAND) examples
outperforms that on the manually selected (MAN)
examples. For the OOT evaluation the situation is
reversed. This could indicate that, depending on the
motivation for the manual selections, the system is
not particularly well-suited to selecting an obvious
singular substitution, but is quite capable of ranking
reasonably acceptable ones near the top of the list.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830263157895">
The Lexical Sample system used features identical
to those described for the Coarse-Grained All-Words
task, with the addition of the CCG supertag feature,
discussed below. Labeled data used for training the
classifier models in this system consisted of only the
instances in the training data supplied for the task,
although the Web1T corpus was of course used to
provide extensive information in the form of features
for those instances. As for the All-Words system, an
individual SVM model was trained using linear ker-
nels for each lemma being disambiguated. The con-
textual BOW features were not selected from within
a window as for the All-Words system; instead the
entire context provided in the training and test data
was used.
Unlike the other systems, the Lexical Sample sys-
tem produced a prediction for every instance in the
test data, as the MWE limitation of the Web1T pro-
cessing software did not present an impediment.

6.2 CCG Verb Categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962052631579">
The Lexical sample data was parsed using the Clark
and Curran CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004).
Existing tagging and parsing models, derived from
CCGBank are included with the parser package, and
were used without adjustment. Gold-standard parses
available for the source data were not used.
The syntactic combination category (“supertags”)
assigned to target verbs by the parser were used as
features. This category label encodes information
about the types of the other sentential components
used when building a parse. A forward slash indi-
cates that the current token requires a component of
the specified type to the right; a backwards slash re-
quires one to the left. The C&amp;C parser includes a
supertagger, but this supertagger assigns multiple la-
bels with varying degrees of confidence, and when
the parse is performed, the supertag labels are sub-
ject to revision in determining the most likely parse.

the final, parser-determined supertag.
As an example, consider the occur-
rence of the verb find in the following two
fragments where it has different senses:
managers did not find out about questionable billing
and
or new revenues are found by Congress
In the first fragment find has a (simplified) supertag
of (SNP)/PP, while in the second it is playing a
different grammatical role, and hence has a different
supertag: SNP. While these supertags are gener-
ally not exclusively associated with a single sense
in particular, their distribution is sufficiently distinct
over different senses that features derived from
them are informative for the WSD task. To form
features, the system uses the supertags obtained
from the parser as binary features, with a slight
simplification: by removing distinctions between
the argument types of the main S component,
generalisation is facilitated among instances of
verbs which differ slightly on a local level but
combine with other parts of the sentence similarly.

Unfortunately, the component of the lexical sample
system responsible for assigning identifiers for eval-
uation contained a systematic error, resulting in a
mismatch between the predictions of the system and
the correct labels as used in evaluation. The system
assumed that for each lemma in the test set, the in-
stances in the test data file would have lexicographi-
cally ascending identifiers, and matched predictions
to identifiers using this assumption. This was not
the case in the task data, and yielded a result for
the submission that severely underestimated the per-
formance of the system. We calculated a baseline
of 0.788 for the Lexical Sample sub-task, using the
Most Frequent Sense for each lemma in the training
data. The result for the systems initial submission
was 0.743 (precision, recall, accuracy and F1 are all
identical, as the system provides an answer for every
instance).
However, as the mismatch is systematic, and only
occurred after the classifier had made its predictions,
it was possible to correct almost all of the alignment
by post-processing the erroneous answer file. By
holding the order of predictions constant, but lexico-
graphically sorting instance identifiers within each
lemma, predictions were re-matched with their in-
tended identifiers. Using the test labels provided by
the task organisers, the accuracy of the system after
repairing the mismatch was 0.891.
As the parser does not have 100% coverage, the
parse of the test sentence did not succeed in every
instance. This in turn caused some supertag features
to be misaligned with other feature types before the
error was rectified. This meant that a small frac-
tion of instances were given predictions in the sub-
mitted data that differed from those produced by the
corrected system. When the already-trained models
were used to re-predict the classes of the correctly
aligned test instances, a further small improvement
to a result of 0.893 was achieved.
It is encouraging that the results (after correcting
the misaligned identifiers) for the patched system are
approaching the Inter Tagger Agreement (ITA) level
reported for OntoNotes sense tags by the task or-
ganisers – 90%. This could be seen as an positive
outcome of the movement towards coarser-grained
sense inventories for the WSD tasks, it is difficult
for automated systems to agree with humans more
often than they agree with each other.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999509375">
Substantially similar information in the form of a
PMI-based substitutability measure from the Web1T
corpus was used in all USYD systems. That
this information yielded positive results in different
semantic-ambiguity related tasks, both supervised
and unsupervised, demonstrates the usefulness of
the data at the scale of the Web1T corpus, either
alone or in concert with other information sources,
and there are still many more approaches to using
this resource for semantic processing that could be
explored.
The systems demonstrated outstanding perfor-
mance on the Lexical Sample WSD task – nearly
at the level of the reported ITA. Good unsupervised
performance above the baseline was also achieved
on the Lexical Substitution task.

<abstract confidence="0.99978325">This paper describes the University of Sydney’s WSD and Lexical Substitution systems for SemEval-2007. These systems are principally based on evaluating the substitutability of potential synonyms in the context of the target word. Substitutability is measured using Pointwise Mutual Information as obtained from the Web1T corpus. The WSD systems are supervised, while the Lexical Substitution system is unsupervised. The lexical sample sub-task also used syntactic category information given from a CCG-based parse to assist in verb disambiguation, while both WSD tasks also make use of more traditional features.</abstract>

Our WSD systems combine our novel PMI-Web1T features and CCG category features with additional features described in the literature. While the Web1T corpus consists only of counts, and thus is somewhat similar to the direct use of counts from Internet search engines, it is also of a known size and thus it is straightforward to determine useful quantities such as PMI, and to exhaustively catalog potential matches as for the lexical substitution task. 3.1 Web1T Corpus The Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) is a dataset consisting of the counts for n-grams obtained from 1 trillion (1012) words of English Web text, subject to a minimum occurrence threshold (200 instances for unigrams, 40 for others). The Web1T corpus contains counts for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams, and is large enough to present serious processing difficulties: it is 25GB in compressed form. The systems presented here thus use custom highperformance software to extract only the n-gram counts of interest from the Web1T data, including simple wildcard pattern-matching.

Extension of the substitutability measure to directly select a sense related to good substitutes, similar to the approach outlined in Lin (1997) would be one possible approach to resolve this consistently. The classifier used for the system was an SVM (libsvm) (Chang and Lin, 2001). Linear kernels were used, as previous experiments using similar features with other data sets for WSD had shown that these kernels outperformed radial basis function and polynomial kernels; this disparity became particularly pronounced with larger number of features compared to training instances, and with the combination of different feature types.

Church et al. (1994) show that Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is a suitable measure to capture the degree to which a given word may substitute for another; we have adopted PMI as the quantified measure of substitutability in the systems used for these tasks.

For a given substitute and context, an overall PMI is determined as a single quantity, obtained by simply adding the PMI together from each window position of each size covered in the data: 448 observationn,i log2 expectationn,i #(sub + contextn,i) log2 p(sub) · p(contextn,i) · Nn Here n represents the window size (varying from 2 to 5), i is the position within the window, and Nn indicates the total number of n-grams present in the corpus for a given value of n. Following Church et al. (1994) the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) is used for both probabilities in the denominator. p(sub) is estimated from the unigram frequency of the substitute word, while p(context) is derived from the counts of the context ignoring the token in the target location. Features were also created that harnessed the idea that it is not only the level of substitutability for each candidate word that is useful, but also that it may be informative to recognise that some words are better substitutes than others.

The contextual BOW features were not selected from within a window as for the All-Words system; instead the entire context provided in the training and test data was used. Unlike the other systems, the Lexical Sample system produced a prediction for every instance in the test data, as the MWE limitation of the Web1T processing software did not present an impediment. 6.2 CCG Verb Categories The Lexical sample data was parsed using the Clark and Curran CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004). Existing tagging and parsing models, derived from CCGBank are included with the parser package, and were used without adjustment. Gold-standard parses available for the source data were not used. The syntactic combination category (“supertags”) assigned to target verbs by the parser were used as features. This category label encodes information about the types of the other sentential components used when building a parse. A forward slash indicates that the current token requires a component of the specified type to the right; a backwards slash requires one to the left. The C&amp;C parser include</context>

This information was captured by adding additional features consisting of the pairwise differences between PMI values for all candidate substitute words. To further draw the differing levels of substitutability into relief, features representing the rank of each pair’s PMI difference were also included. Finally, each of the above feature types yields real-valued features. Before being used in classification, these features were converted to binary features using supervised Entropy-Based Discretisation (Fayyad and Irani, 1993). This process characterises the partition selection as a message coding problem: the class labels in the training data are a message to be encoded given that the value of the feature is known for each instance, and the process aims to minimise the length of that message. This is achieved by recursively bifurcating each feature’s values at the partition point that would result in the shortest message. Useful boundaries are those where knowing which side of the partition the feature value falls on can be used to reduce the message length beyond any increase required to specify the partition.

Church et al. (1994) show that Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is a suitable measure to capture the degree to which a given word may substitute for another; we have adopted PMI as the quantified measure of substitutability in the systems used for these tasks. While previous WSD systems have made use of counts obtained from Internet search engines, for example Martinez et al. (2006), to our knowledge WSD using corpus data at the scale of the Web1T resource has not previously been published. Our WSD systems combine our novel PMI-Web1T features and CCG category features with additional features described in the literature. While the Web1T corpus consists only of counts, and thus is somewhat similar to the direct use of counts from Internet search engines, it is also of a known size and thus it is straightforward to determine useful quantities such as PMI, and to exhaustively catalog potential matches as for the lexical substitution task. 3.1 Web1T Corpus The Web1T corpus (</context>

A limitation in the implementation is that the number of tokens that can be matched in a wildcard expression is fixed at one. This limitation precluded the testing of substitutability of multiword-expressions (MWEs) in the systems applied to 447 the SemEval tasks. 4 Task 7: Coarse Grained-English All-Words WSD The system for Coarse-Grained All-Words WSD was supervised, but only attempted classification for a subset of words. These words were chosen according to the amount of sense-tagged training data available, drawn from SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) and the SenseEval-3 lexical sample (Mihalcea et al., 2004) task. Features were extracted and a classifier trained for each ambiguous content word that was either present in the SenseEval-3 lexical sample, or occurred at least 100 times in SemCor. These criteria yielded classifiers for 183 words. For ambiguous words without sufficient available training data, the first sense baseline (determined from WordNet version 2.1 (Fellbaum, 1998)) was assigned to every instance. No manual augmentation of the information from WordNet was performed. For those words where models were being trained, the sense clusterings provided by the task organisers were used to</context>
