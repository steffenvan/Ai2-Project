<bodyText confidence="0.998628909090909">
The aim of this short paper is to present the
FLaReNet Thematic Network for Language
Resources and Language Technologies to the
Asian Language Resources Community.
Creation of a wide and committed community
and of a shared policy in the field of Language
Resources is essential in order to foster a
substantial advancement of the field. This
paper presents the background, overall
objectives and methodology of work of the
project, as well as a set of preliminary results.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972212765958">
The field of Language Resources and
Technologies has been developing for years to
reach now a stable and consolidated status,
attaining the right to be considered a discipline in
itself, and as testified by the number of
conferences and publications explicitly dedicated
to the topic. Even if Language Resources (in the
widest sense, i.e. spoken, written and multi-
modal resources and basic related tools) have a
rather short history, they are nowadays
recognized as one of the pillars of NLP. The
availability of adequate Language Resources for
as many languages as possible is a pre-requisite
for the development of a truly multilingual
Information Society.
At the same time, however, the discipline has
seen considerable fragmentation during those
years of fast and enthusiast development, and the
landscape is now composed by a kaleidoscope of
different, often conflicting initiatives that vary as
for research directions, theoretical approaches,
implementation choices, distribution and access
policies, languages, domain and modalities
covered, etc.
The growth of the field in the last years should
be now complemented by a common reflection
and by an effort that identifies synergies and
overcomes fragmentation. The consolidation of
the area is a pre-condition to enhance
competitiveness at EU level and worldwide.
There is the need of working together to define
common strategies and to identify priorities for
the field to advance. Multiple concurring signs
are now indicating that time is ripe for
establishing an open language infrastructure,
something that many of us have been pushing
since some time and that is now increasingly
recognized in the community at large as a
necessary step for building on each other
achievements.
Such an open infrastructure can only be
realized if the Language Resources community is
cohesive enough to be able to focus on a number
or priority targets and collectively work towards
them, and, at the same time, whether it is
powerful enough to permeate the user
community, the industry, and the policy-makers.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798071428571">
Creation of the necessary conditions for the
development of such an infrastructure cannot
rely on research activities only and even more
cannot rely on the initiative of individual groups.
Instead, strategic actions are crucial, such as
making contacts with and involving all interested
parties, sensitize the policy makers and
institutional bodies, involve associations and
consortia, disseminating widely the results of
common efforts. Only by mobilizing this wide
and heterogeneous panorama of actors can such
an ambitious goal be attained.

European Commission under the eContentPlus
framework (ECP-2007-LANG-617001) 1 . The
FLaReNet Thematic Network was born with the
specific aim – as required by the European
Commission itself – to enhance European
competitiveness in the field of Language
Resources and Technologies, especially by
consolidating a common vision and fostering a
European strategy for the future. A major, long-
term objective – as well as a powerful means for
community creation – is creating the preparatory
environment for making an open language
infrastructure a reality.

3 Objectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985553">
The objectives of FLaReNet are threefold:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991749181818182">
• The creation and mobilization of a
unified and committed community in the
field of Language Resources and
Technologies;
• The identification of a set of priority
themes on which to stimulate action, under
the form of a roadmap for Language
Resources and Technologies;
• The elaboration of a blueprint of priority
areas for actions in the field and a
coherent set of recommendations for the

policy-makers (funding agencies
especially), the business community and
the public at large.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999733">
3.1 Creation of a community
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991473684211">
FLaReNet has the challenging task of creating a
network of people around the notion of
Language Resources and Technologies. To this
end, FLaReNet is bringing together leading
experts of research institutions, academies,
companies, funding agencies, with the specific
purpose of creating consensus around short,
medium and long-term strategic objectives. It is
of foremost importance that the FLaReNet
Network be composed of the as widest as
possible representation of experiences, practices,
research lines, industrial and political strategies;
this in order to derive an overall picture of the
field of Language Resources and Technologies
that is not limited to the European scenario, but
can also be globally inspired. The Network is
currently composed of around 200 individuals
belonging to academia, research institutes,
industries and government. Such a community
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9994942">
also needs to be constantly increased in a
concentric way that starts from the core
disciplines but gradually projects itself towards
“neighboring” ones, such as cognitive science,
semantic web, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999647">
3.2 Identification of priority themes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999886">
Language technologies and language resources
are the necessary ingredients for the development
of applications that will help bridging language
barriers in a global single information space, in a
variety of means (the Web as well as
communication devices) and for a variety of
channels (spoken and written language alike). It
is of utmost importance, however, to identify
priorities as well as short, medium, and long-
term strategic objectives in order to avoid
scattered or conflicting efforts.
The major players in the field of Language
Resources and Technologies need to
consensually work together and indicate a clear
direction and priorities for the next years.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999007">
3.3 Elaboration of a blueprint of actions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981173913043">
However, whatever action cannot be
implemented on a long term without the help of
the necessary financial and political framework
to sustain them. This is even most true for
actions regarding Language Resources that
typically imply a sustained effort at national
level. To this end, the FLaReNet Network must
propose the priority themes under the form of
consensual recommendations and a plan of
action for EC Member States, other European-
wide decision makers, companies, as well as
non-EU and International organizations.
FLaReNet goals are very ambitious and its
objectives are to be seen in a more global
framework. Although they are shaped by the
European landscape of the field of LR&amp;T, its
mission is therefore inherently cross-boundary:
in order to attain such goals getting a global view
is fundamental.
To this end, it is important that FLaReNet is
known by the Asian community, and it knows
the Asian community. Some Asian community
players are already members of the Network.

4 How FLaReNet works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994297">
Work in FLaReNet is inherently collaborative.
Its means are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999858">
• Working groups
• Organization of workshops and meetings
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.85324">

<listItem confidence="0.871399">
• External liaisons
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977415">
4.1 Working Groups
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998984875">
Working Groups are intended as “think-tanks” of
experts (researchers and users) who jointly
reflect on selected topics and come up with
conclusions and recommendations. The Working
Groups are clustered in thematic areas and carry
out their activities through workshops, meetings,
and via a collaborative Wiki platform. The
FLaReNet Thematic Areas are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977488">
• The Chart for the area of Language
Resources and Technologies in its
different dimensions
• Methods and models for Language
Resource building, reuse, interlinking,
maintenance, sharing, and distribution
• Harmonization of formats and standards
• Definition of evaluation and validation
protocols and procedures
• Methods for the automatic construction
and processing of Language Resources.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9274515">
4.2 Organization of workshops and
meetings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999477">
Meetings and events lie at the core of FLaReNet
action plan and dissemination strategies. They
can either be specifically oriented to the
dissemination of results and recommendations
(content-pushing events) or, rather, to their
elicitation (content-pulling events). Three types
of meetings are envisaged:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983864666666667">
• Annual Workshops, such as the
“European Language Resources and
Technologies Forum” held in Vienna,
February 2009
• Thematic Workshops related to the work
of Working Groups
• Liaison meetings (e.g. those with NSF-
SILT, CLARIN, ISO and other projects as
the need may arise).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999723388888889">
Annual workshops are targeted to gather the
broad FLaReNet community together. They are
conceived as big events, and they aim at
becoming major events in the Language
Resources and Technology community of the
kind able to attract a considerable audience.
Given the success of the formula exploited for
the FLaReNet “Vienna Event”2, it is likely that
Annual workshops will be organized along the
same lines. However, this type of event cannot
be repeated on a frequent schedule. At the same
time, more focused events centered on specific
topics and with extensive time allocated for
discussion are essential.
To this end, Annual Workshops will be
complemented by many Thematic workshops,
i.e. more focused, dedicated meetings with a
more restricted audience. These are directly
linked to the work being carried out by the
various Working Groups and are organized in a
de-centralized manner, by direct initiative of the
Working Group or Work package Leaders. In an
attempt to increase FLaReNet sensitivity to hot
issues, selection of topics and issues to be
addressed will be also based on a bottom-up
approach: FLaReNet members and subscribers
are invited to submit topics of interest either
freely or as a consequence of “Call for topics”
related to particular events.
Finally, liaison meetings are those elicited by
FLaReNet to make contact and create synergies
with national and international projects that are
partially overlapping with FLaReNet in either
their objectives or the target audience. Examples
of these are the FLaReNet-CLARIN and the
FLaReNet-SILT liaison meetings.

4.3 External liaisons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997081875">
For a Network like FLaReNet, whose aim is the
development of strategies and recommendations
for the field of Language Resources and
Technologies, coordination of actions at a
worldwide level is of utmost importance. To this
end, FLaReNet is planning to establish contacts
and liaisons with national and international
associations and consortia, such as LDC, ISO,
ALTA, AFNLP, W3C, TEI, COCOSDA,
Oriental-COCOSDA. Specific actions of this
kind have started already, such as the
International Cooperation Round Table that took
place in Vienna. The members of the
International Cooperation Round Table will form
the initial nucleus of the FLaReNet International
Advisory Board.

specific purpose of setting up a brainstorming
force to make emerge the technological, market
and policy challenges to be faced in a
multilingual digital Europe.
Over a two-day programme, the participants to
the Forum had the opportunity to start assessing
the current conditions of the LR&amp;T field and to
propose emerging directions of intervention.
Some messages recurred repeatedly across the
various sessions, as a sign both of a great
convergence around these ideas and also of their
relevance in the field. A clear set of priorities
thus emerged for fostering the field of Language
Resources and Language Technology.
Language Resource Creation. The effort
required to build all needed language resources
and common tools should impose on all players a
strong cooperation at the international level and
the community should define how to enhance
current coordination of language resource
collection between all involved agencies and
ensure efficiency (e.g. through interoperability).
With data-driven methods dominating the
current paradigms, language resource building,
annotation, cataloguing, accessibility,
availability is what the research community is
calling for. Major institutional translation
services, holding large volumes of useful data,
seem to be ready to share their data and
FLaReNet could possibly play a facilitating role.
More efforts should be devoted to solve how to
automate the production of the large quantity of
resources demanded, and of enough quality to
get acceptable results in industrial environments.
Standards and Interoperability. In the long
term, interoperability will be the cornerstone of a
global network of language processing
capabilities. The time and circumstances are ripe
to take a broad and forward-looking view in
order to establish and implement the standards
and technologies necessary to ensure language
resource interoperability in the future. This can
only be achieved through a coordinated,
community-wide effort that will ensure both
comprehensive coverage and widespread
acceptance.
Coordination of Language Technology
Evaluation. Looking at the way forward, it
clearly appears that language technology
evaluation needs coordination at international
level: in order to ensure the link between
technologies and applications, between
evaluation campaigns and projects, in order to
conduct evaluation campaigns (for ensuring
synchrony or for addressing the influence of a
component on a system on the same data), in
order to produce language resources from
language technology evaluation, or to port an
already evaluated language technology to other
languages (best practices, tools, metrics,
protocols...), in order to avoid “reinventing the
wheel”, while being very cautious that there are
language and cultural specificities which have to
be taken into account (tone languages, oral
languages with no writing system, etc).
Availability of Resources, Tools and
Information. Infrastructure building seems to be
one of the main messages for FLaReNet. For a
new worldwide language infrastructure the issue
of access to Language Resources and
Technologies is a critical one that should involve
– and have impact on – all the community. There
is the need to create the means to plug together
different Language Resources &amp; Language
Technologies, in an internet-based resource and
technology grid, with the possibility to easily
create new workflows. Related to this is
openness and availability of information. The
related issues of access rights and IPR also call
for cooperation.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946769230769">
The field of Language Resources and
Technologies needs a strong and coherent
international cooperation policy to become more
competitive and play a leading role globally. It is
crucial to discuss future policies and priorities
for the field of Language Resources and
Technologies – as in the mission of FLaReNet –
not only on the European scene, but also in a
worldwide context. Cooperation is an issue that
needs to be prepared. FLaReNet may become
one of the privileged places where these – and
future – initiatives get together to discuss and
promote collaboration actions.
