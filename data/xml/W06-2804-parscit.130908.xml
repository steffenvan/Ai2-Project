<bodyText confidence="0.998740517241379">
This paper is a presentation of a
doctoral research in progress focused
on a new genre: online
encyclopaedias. The introduction to
Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia
Britannica Online will be followed by
a presentation of wiki as a new textual
genre. Wikipedia analysis will focus
firstly on the investigation of the
“WikiLanguage”, the language used in
official encyclopaedic articles.
Secondly, the “WikiSpeak”, the
spoken-written language used by
Wikipedians in their backstage and
informal community, will be taken
into account. The initial findings of
this research seem to suggest that, the
language of the Wikipedia’s co-
authored articles is formal and
standardized in a way similar to that
found in Encyclopaedia Britannica
Online. By contrast, the WikiSpeak, as
a new variety of NetSpeak Jargon, can
be considered as a creative domain, an
independent and individual expression
of linguistic freedom of self-
representation, characterizing the wiki
Computer Mediated Discourse
Community.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964355555556">
The encyclopaedia&apos;s structure, either hierarchical
or alphabetically ordered, with its evolving
nature is particularly adaptable to a disk-based
or online format. All major printed
encyclopaedias have moved to this method of
delivery. Online E-ncyclopedias can include
multimedia (such as video, sound clips and
animated illustrations) unavailable in the printed
format. They can make use of hypertext cross-
references between conceptually related items
and, furthermore, they offer the additional
advantage of being dynamic: new and frequently
updated information can be presented almost
immediately, rather than waiting for the next
release of a static format (as with a paper or disk
publication).
This research is based particularly on a
contrastive linguistic analysis of Wikipedia and
Encyclopaedia Britannica Online. The latter is
considered one of the greatest examples of
general encyclopaedias in the English speaking
world. It contains 120,000 articles which are
commonly considered accurate, reliable and
well-written. Brief article summaries can be
viewed for free on the net, while the full text is
available only for individuals with monthly or
yearly subscription.
On the other hand, Wikipedia is a
collaborative authoring project on the web, a
repository of encyclopaedic knowledge, an
example of a collaborative hypermedium
focused on a common project. It is one of the
most popular reference websites receiving
around 50 million hits per day. It is a social e-
democracy environment, designed with the goal
of creating a free encyclopedia containing
information on all subjects written
collaboratively by volunteers. At the time of
writing this paper the project has produced over
two and half million articles and has been
officially recognized as the largest international
online community. It consists of 200
independent language editions and the English
version is the biggest one with more than
962,995 articles (up to January 2006).

2. Wiki as new textual genre
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976818181818">
With reference to the extensive empirical
studies of Susan Herring on CMC, wikis and
blogs considered as spaces belonging to the
second web generation, can be regarded as
adding new peculiarities to the existing
synchronous and asynchronous tools of the
first CMC generation (such as e-mail, mailing
list, forum and chat). It is well known in media
studies that “the medium is the message” as
McLuhan (1964) pointed out in the sixties, and
in fact the medium adds unique properties to

the web genre in terms of production, function,
and reception which cannot be ignored. Wikis
are co-authoring tools which allow collective
collaboration. They can be, simultaneously, a
repository of information and an asynchronous
tool of communication and discussion across
the web (see Wikipedia). All wikis have
integrated search engines for locating content
and are open to anyone since they are
considered a public space, even though they
can be protected against unauthentic users.
Their main aim is to create documents.
Wikis, unlike traditionally designed web sites,
encourage “topical writing” by using wiki links
and creating a wide network of interconnected
pages. The interlinking process becomes
simpler to type by just putting the word(s) in
square brackets. It simultaneously creates a
new topic title (a WikiWord), a new writing
space for that topic and a link to that space.
Once created, a topic will be available
anywhere on the wiki as whenever the
WikiWord is typed, it will link to the writing
space of that topic (Morgan, 2006).
The writer, the supreme authority in print, is
considered the one who transmits content
through paper pages, to passive readers, whose
role is merely to decode and interpret their
message. The electronic writing space, being
hypertextual and extremely flexible, changes
the landscape. Writers can create multiple
structures from the same topics (hierarchy,
web, spiral, etc.) and readers can enter, browse
and leave text at many points. In the hypertext,
the author creates different paths for the reader,
although there is neither a canonical path nor a
defined page order to follow. The new active
readers making their choices, become co-
authors of the hypertext (Bolter, 1991). This
idea is more pronounced on a wiki than
elsewhere, because in an open wiki the reader
can (if allowed) really interrupt the process, re-
writing, changing, erasing and modifying the
original text or creating new topics.
Traditional writing creates a gap between
writer and reader. Wiki technology mediates
the gap because the two actors assume
interchangeable roles in this new open e-
environment. To conclude, wiki text is never
static as it is considered revisable, a-temporal
as nodes continually change through the
collaborative writing process, creating a never
ending evolving network of topics. Thus,
knowledge becomes webbed, contextualized
though it remains temporary as it can always
be changed or vandalized. Luckily, the original
version can always, and easily, be recovered
by SysOps1, through page histories2 (Morgan,
2006).
Wikis offer two different writing modes. The
first one is known as “document mode”. When
it is used, contributors create documents
collaboratively and can leave their additions to
articles. Multiple authors can edit and update
the content of documents which gradually
become representations of contributors’ shared
knowledge (Leuf and Cunningham, 2001).
Wikis have two states, “Read” and “Edit”.
“Read state” is by default. In this case, wiki
pages look just like normal webpages. When
the user wants to edit a page, he/she must only
access the “edit state”.
“Document mode” is expository, extensive,
monological, formal, refined and less creative
than “thread mode”. It is in third person and
unsigned. “Document mode” demonstrates that
knowledge is collective and that the ideas, not
the writers, are the main focus. Writers
contribute to “document mode” refactoring,
reorganizing, incorporating and synthesizing
“thread mode” comments in encyclopaedic
articles and changing the first to third person
(Morgan, 2006).
The second wiki writing mode is “thread
mode”. Contributors carry out discussions by
posting signed messages in the discussion page
connected to the main article. Others reply to
the original message and so a group of
threaded messages evolves (Morgan, 2006).
“Thread mode” is dialogical, open,
collective, dynamic and informal. It develops
organically, without a predictive structure. It
expresses public thinking, presents multiple
positions and is exploratory. Entries are
phrased in first person and are signed. Rather
then replying to a discussion entry, the writer
can refactor the page to incorporate
suggestions made, then delete the comment.
“Thread mode” demonstrates that knowledge
is the result of constructivist collaboration and
not a lonely production.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987769">
3.1. Wikipedia vs Britannica
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971471318181818">
The first objective of this research has been
directed towards the investigation of Wikipidia
articles and on what has been defined, in this
paper as “WikiLanguage”, the formal, neutral
and impersonal language used in the official
encyclopedic articles. In this phase, an analysis
of randomly selected sample articles has been
carried out. The data for this research in
progress has been based on two corpora. Up to
now, they include a collection of txt files made
up of one hundred articles representing topics
taken from the Wiki Folksonomy’s 3 eight
categories (culture, geography, history, life,
mathematics, science, society, technology) and
on a contrastive analysis of the same articles
found in Encyclopaedia Britannica Online.
The purpose of the quantitative research has
been the empirical measurement of some
linguistic features in order to define the degree
of formality in the WikiLanguage. The sample
articles have been analyzed through the
ConcApp Concordancer Program. Different
factors have been taken into consideration in
order to define the formality of Britannica vs
Wikipedia. The first aspect has been articles’
length (total words) as conciseness was found
to be a feature of formal written discourse
(Chafe, 1982). The second, average word
length (in letters) as short words have been
considered a characteristic of informal genres
(Biber, 1988). A high level of lexical density
(Halliday, 1985) has been found in formal
academic writing. It has been considered the
main stylistic difference between speech and
writing (Biber, 1988).
Subsequently, the number of unique lexical
items in the two corpora has been measured.
With reference to the findings of Heylighen
and Dewaele (1999), frequency of word
suffixes typical in formal genres (such as -age,
-ment, -ance/ence, -ion, -ity, -ism) and
impersonal pronouns (it/they) have been
calculated. A contrastive frequency of
meaningful keywords has also been
3 Folksonomy is a neologism which indicates a practice
of collaborative categorization which makes use of freely
chosen keywords. Taxonomy derives from Greek “taxis”
and “nomos”. “Taxis” means classification, “nomos” (or
nomia) management and “folk” people; so folksonomy
means people’s classification management.
investigated. The informality of the language
has been measured through the frequency of
abbreviations, acronyms, contractions (I&apos;m,
don&apos;t, he&apos;s, etc.) and personal pronouns (I, we,
you, he/she, they) which have been found to be
typical of informal genres, such as face-to-face
and phone conversations (Biber, 1988). As
shown in Appendix A (Fig.1), the first results
of this research conducted on one hundred
articles have highlighted a number of
differences and similarities between Wikipedia
and Britannica.
Articles in Britannica have proven to be
shorter than those in Wikipedia (average
length: 1728 vs 3510 words) and they have
shown a higher lexical density (44.9% vs
31.4%). Although the level of total formality is
clearly higher in Britannica (50.2% vs 36.6%),
the frequency of formal nouns and impersonal
pronouns typical of the formal discourse (5.3
vs 5.2) and the average word length (in letters
5.4 vs 5.2) has proven to be very similar. The
divergent value is related to lexical density, but
if text length varies widely (as happens in the
two e-ncyclopedias) the different lexical items
will appear to be much higher in the shortest
text as their relationship is not linear. Each
additional one hundred words of text adds
fewer and fewer additional unique words
(Biber, 1988). Thus, an interpretation of the
collected data seems to suggest that thanks to
the collective editorial control, the
WikiLanguage of the co-authored articles
shows a formal and standardized style similar
to that found in Britannica. A table
representing a part of the collected data, and
their graphical representation, has been
provided in Appendix A (Fig. 2,3,4).

3.2 Web analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941928571429">
Particular attention has been devoted to
Wikipedia digital style due to the importance of
the interplay between genre and medium when
dealing with web-mediated texts. The layout of
sample articles has been investigated (table of
content, sections and sub-sections extension) as
well as multimodality (tables, graphs, images,
audio recordings and videos) and
hypertextuality [explicative (internal
bookmarks), associative (wikilinks) and
explorative links (external weblinks)]. At
present Wikipedia does not seem to fully
exploit the potential offered by multimodality
(and Britannica even less), showing few audio

recordings and videos. This is probably due to
the feature of Open Source software, keeping
with hackers’ simple and essential style (i.e.
Slashdot and Everything2), to the contributors’
average technical skills and to the philosophical
choice which grants a privilege to information
and content over appearance. One of the
prominent properties of Wikipedia is its highly
dense hypertextuality when compared to
Britannica. The analysis of the articles clearly
reveal the abundance of Wikipedia’s nodes
interlinking and dynamism, made possible by
wiki software and, by contrast, the isolation,
linearity (page structure) and static nature of
corresponding Britannica articles. In this case
using Finnemann’s (1999) concept of “modal
shifts” with reference “to reading mode” and
“navigating mode”, it is evident that Wikipedia
articles actively stimulates the latter allowing
the reader to construct his/her own personal
pathway, browsing inside and outside the
website.

4. WikiSpeak
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998308">
The second phase of this research will focus on
Wikipedia as “Computer Mediated Discourse
Community” and on the language, defined in
this paper as “WikiSpeak”, the language
spoken-written by Wikipedians in their
informal backstage community. The medium
has developed its own wired style and specific
glossary, which resembles in some aspects the
hackers’ Jargon File. The main WikiSpeak
distinctiveness lies in the lexicon used.
WikiSpeak is an unofficial and high-context
language which can be considered as a new
variety of the Netspeak, one of the most
creative domains of contemporary English. Its
peculiarity is immediately evident in the
“wikilogisms” found in the Community Portal
homepage (i.e. stub, NPV, wikify, backlogs,
FAQ, village pump, etc.) which can be
considered, for its lexical density, a supreme
synthesis of WikiSpeak, as well as a political
manifesto as the wiki philosophical essence
and its informal community style are clearly
disclosed here4.
The present investigation has started from its
analysis in order to measure the impact of the
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.53055575">
4 In the Community Portal homepage, of 1604 words
used, 809 are unique words. The lexical density is very
high 50.4%. The keywords are: help (19), you (16),
article (16), collaboration (8), free (7).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997025">
community front door (content, form,
functionality) on the reader, and it will go on
analysing the WikiSpeak used in discussion
pages connected to the selected articles.
A large number of new words have emerged.
WikiSpeak is an informal and colloquial
language rich, for example, in acronyms [i.e.
NPOV (Neutral Point Of View), COTW
(Collaboration Of The Week), IFD (Image For
Deletion), etc]. Plenty of abbreviations are also
found. They are individual words reduced to
two or three letters, [i.e. pls (please), bb ppls
(bye bye peoples), etc]. Some abbreviations are
like rebuses, as the sound value of the letter, or
numeral, acts as a syllable of a word [i.e. B4N
(bye for now), CYL (see you later), etc]. Wiki
acronyms used in wiki CMC (discussion
pages, mailing lists, IRC channels, instant
messaging and personal user pages) are not
restricted to words or short phrases, but can be
sentence-length [i.e. WDYS (what did you
say?), CIO (check it out), etc].
Many word processes take place in
WikiSpeak, including several ludic
innovations. A popular method of creating
wikilogisms is to combine two separate words
to make new compound words. Some elements
turn up repeatedly, i.e. Wiki (WikiPage,
WikiBooks, WikiLink, WikiStress, etc.)5. In
addition, WikiSpeak makes large use of blends
(namespace, infobox, quickpoll, etc.) and
semantic shifts [i.e. orphan, mirror, stub, etc]
shown in the wiki glossary available for the
newbies.
Distinctive graphology is also an important
feature of WikiSpeak. All orthographic
features have been affected. For example, the
status of capitalization varies greatly. There is
a strong tendency to use lowercase everywhere
on the net. The lower-case default mentality
means that any use of capitalization is a
marked form of communication. Messages
wholly in capitals are considered to be
shouting and usually avoided. A distinctive
feature of Wiki graphology is the way two
capitals are used: one initial, one medial.
This phenomenon is called BiCapitalization
(BiCaps or CamelCase6) and is widespread in

<footnote confidence="0.998790333333333">
5 In Wikipedia veterans avoid their use as it is considered
cliché. However it is tolerated when it refers to technical
terms (i.e. wikilinks).
6 CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words
or phrases where the words are joined without spaces,
and each word is capitalized within the compound. The

<bodyText confidence="0.99996617948718">
Wiki community (i.e. MediaWiki, WikiProject,
etc.). It is a very interesting example of how a
programming language influences the wired
style, as BiCaps were used in hackers’
communities as a word joiner alternative to the
underscore based style and, in the original wiki
convention to create links before the invention
of [[ _ ]] square brackets. Now it has become
fashionable in marketing for names of products
and companies. Outside these contexts,
however, BiCaps are rarely used in formal
written English, and most style guides
recommend against it.
Spelling practice is also a WikiSpeak
distinctive character. New spelling conventions
have emerged, such as the replacement of
plural –s by –z. Emotional expressions make
use of a varying number of vowels and
consonants (yayyyyyyy) and repeated
punctuation (WHAT????), but punctuation
sometimes tends to be minimalist or
completely absent, a great deal depends on the
user’s personality: some Wikipedians are
scrupulous about maintaining a traditional
punctuation while some do not use it at all. On
the other hand, there is an increased use of
symbols not normally part of the traditional
punctuation system, such as # , or repeated
dots (...), hyphens (---), repeated use of
commas (,,,) or asterisks (***). WikiSpeak, as
a new variety of the NetSpeak Jargon, can be
considered as a creative domain, an
independent and individual expression of the
linguistic freedom of self-representation in the
wiki community of practice.
This research will make use of textual
linguistics and corpus linguistics for the
investigation of the interactions expressed in
the unofficial and informal Wiki CMC.

5. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998653392857143">
In conclusion, this research project has two
main focuses: defining the Wikipedia language
variations within a dual context of use: official
encyclopaedic entries (WikiLanguage) vs
backstage community Speak (WikiSpeak).
Wikipedia, as a new expression for the
encyclopedic genre, appears very similar to
traditional printed encyclopedias due to its
stylistic homogeneity, expressed Neutral Point

of View7 and formal style. The first findings of
this research in progress seem to demonstrate
how Wikipedia succeeds in reproducing an
extant traditional genre even if applied to a
collaborative and constructivist scenario.
According to Shephered and Watters (1998),
extant subgenres are based on already existing
genres in other media forms which have been
converted into digital form (i.e. newspaper
into electronic news); on the contrary, novel
subgenres are entirely dependent on the new
medium (i.e. homepages, search engines,
webgames, etc.). They stated that when an
extant genre migrates to a digital environment,
it will initially be faithfully replicated: content
and form will be preserved and the capabilities
of the new medium will not be fully exploited
(see Britannica). At a later stage in the
evolution, variant genres are created. This
process is driven by the technical capabilities
of the new medium. It is the point of view of
this study that Wikipedia can be taken as an
example of the evolution of an extant
traditional genre (encyclopedias) which has
been officially preserved in the articles’
superficial form, but not in the writing and
reading processes (social editing,
intertextuality, high informativeness and
browsing mechanisms). The articles’ textual
form seems to suggest that when collaborative
users have to respect stylistic established
norms (see Wiki Manual of Style8) and shared
social working ethics (see Wikiquette9),
diversity and controversy are erased and the
official requested style is respected within the
open editing system. Nevertheless,
technological advantages offered by
collaborative software, reinforce the variety,
the quick updating and interconnection of the
information provided by the contributors’
multitude. Their voices, even if individually,
originally and democratically expressed in the
CMC wiki community, are merged and
homogenized in the articles’ neutrality and
formality.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9587875">
7 A Neutral Point Of View (NPOV) is writing free from
bias. It is generally considered desirable for journalistic
and encyclopedic writings. According to the Wikipedia’s
founder, Jimbo Wales, NPOV is an &amp;quot;absolute and non-
negotiable&amp;quot; principle in Wiki Manual of Style.
8 Manual of Style is a style guide for Wikipedia’s
contributors. It has the purpose of making the editing
easier by following a consistent format.
9 Principles of Wikiquette are the guidelines on how to
work with others on Wikipedia.

Linguistic analysis cannot be separated from
the investigation of the main philosophical and
political goals of Wikipedia whose main aim is
to pursue freedom of content and information
expressed through the Wikipedian “Collective”
(Lèvy, 1994) and “Connective” Intelligence
(de Kerckove, 1997) in this new acentric
rhizomatic environment10 (Deleuze-Guattari,
1980). Encyclopaedia Britannica is a
knowledge compendium without any political
meaning hosted by a commercial website
(.com). In the 18th century, the original French
“Encyclopédie” from Diderot and D’Alambert
was mainly a political project designed to
propagate the ideas of Enlightenment and to
establish the reign of reason in Europe
(Soufron, 2004). Similarly, Wikipedia in the
current I.C.T. age, can be considered as a post-
modern Encyclopaedia, a copyleft reference
work with a non-profit cultural goal (.org)
affording a political project rather than merely
a scientific one. It is aimed at changing the
society of the 21st century by giving control
over content to everyone and thus enhancing
freedom of expression and recovering the
original aim of the World Wide Web inventor:
Sir Tim Berners Lee wanted the web to be a
boundless library of Babel and not a global
supermarket as it has become in the dot.com
era.
