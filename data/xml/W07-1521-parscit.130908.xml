This paper presents the building procedure
of a Chinese sense annotated corpus. A set
of software tools is designed to help hu-
man annotator to accelerate the annotation
speed and keep the consistency. The soft-
ware tools include 1) a tagger for word
segmentation and POS tagging, 2) an an-
notating interface responsible for the sense
describing in the lexicon and sense anno-
tating in the corpus, 3) a checker for con-
sistency keeping, 4) a transformer respon-
sible for the transforming from text file to
XML format, and 5) a counter for sense

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902184210526">
There is a strong need for a large-scale Chinese
corpus annotated with word senses both for word
sense disambiguation (WSD) and linguistic re-
search. Although much research has been carried
out, there is still a long way to go for WSD tech-
niques to meet the requirements of practical NLP
programs such as machine translation and infor-
mation retrieval. It was argued that no fundamen-
tal progress in WSD could be made until large-
scale lexical resources were built (Veronis, 2003).
In English a word sense annotated corpus SEM-
COR (Semantic Concordances) (Landes et al.,
1999) has been built, which was later trained and
tested by many WSD systems and stimulated large
amounts of WSD work. In Japanese the Hinoki
Sensebank is constructed (Tanaka et al., 2006). In
the field of Chinese corpus construction, plenty of
attention has been paid to POS tagging and syn-
tactic structures bracketing, for instance the Penn
Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002) and Sinica
Corpus (Huang et al., 1992), but very limited
work has been done with semantic knowledge
annotation. Huang et al. (2004) introduced the
Sinica sense-based lexical knowledge base, but as
is well known, Chinese pervasive in Taiwan is not
the same as mandarin Chinese. SENSEVAL-3
provides a Chinese word sense annotated corpus,
which contains 20 words and 15 sentences per
meaning for most words, but obviously the data is
too limited to achieve wide coverage, high accu-
racy WSD systems.
This paper is devoted to building a large-scale
Chinese corpus annotated with word senses. A
small part of the Chinese sense annotated corpus
has been adopted as one of the SemEval-2007
tasks namely “Multilingual Chinese-English Lexi-
cal Sample Task” This paper concentrates on the
description of the manually annotating schemes

This paper is so organized as follows. In section
2 the preprocessing stage (word segmentation and
POS tagging) is discussed. Then in section 3 the
annotating scheme and the annotating interface
are demonstrated in detail. The strategy to keep
consistency is addressed in section 4. And then in
section 5 and 6 the two postprocessing stages are
respectively presented. Finally in section 7 con-
clusions are drawn and future works are presented.
2 Word segmentation and POS tagging
The input data for word sense annotating is firstly
word segmented and POS tagged using Peking
University’s POS tagger (Yu et al., 2003). The
POS tagging precision is up to 97.5%, which lays
a sound foundation for researches on sense anno-
tating. This is actually to make use of the full-
fledged syntactic processing techniques to deal
with the semantic annotation problems. Different
senses of one ambiguous word sometimes behave
so differently that they bear different POS tags.
Take “4r_�/hold” in sentence (1) as an example.
The noun of “4r_�/hold” means “confidence”, but
the verb means “grasp”.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4037895">
(1) a 4(have) 4r_�/n(confidence)
b 4r_ /v(grasp) R(ZHU) #LL (chance)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979416666667">
Due to the unique characteristic of Chinese lan-
guage that lacks word inflection, the ambiguous
words with different POSs are very common. Ac-
cording to the research of Li (1999), after POS
tagging the ratio of ambiguous word occurrences
in the text of People’s Daily is reduced from 42%
to 26%. Therefore the emphasis of manually sense
annotating in this paper falls on the ambiguous
words with the same part of speech. This will in
turn save 16% of the annotation effort compared
with the sense annotating before the preprocessing
of POS tagging.

The resulting lexical knowledge base in this pro-
ject will contain three major components: 1) a
corpus annotated with Chinese word senses
namely Chinese Senses Pool (CSP); 2) a lexicon
containing sense distinction and description
namely Chinese Semantic Dictionary (CSD); 3)
the linking between the CSD and the Chinese
Concept Dictionary (CCD) (Liu et al., 2002). The
corpus CSP, the lexicon CSD and CCD constitute
a highly relational and tightly integrated system: 1)
In CSD the sense distinctions are described rely-
ing on the corpus; 2) In CSP the word occurrences
are assigned sense tags according to the sense en-

try specified in CSD; 3) The linking between the
sense entry in CSD and CCD synsets are estab-
lished. The dynamic model is shown in figure 2. A
software tool is developed in Java to be used as
the word sense annotating interface (figure 3),
which embodies the spirit of the dynamic model
properly.

3.1 Sense describing in the lexicon and sense
annotating in the corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802518518518">
In this project the lexicon CSD containing sense
descriptions and the corpus CSP annotated with
senses are built interactively, simultaneously and
dynamically. On one hand, the sense distinctions in
the lexicon are made relying heavily on the corpus
usage. On the other hand, using the sense informa-
tion specified in the lexicon the human annotators
assign semantic tags to all the instances of the
word in a corpus.
In the word sense annotating interface, the sen-
tences from CSP containing the target ambiguous
words are displayed in the upper section, and the
word senses with feature-based description from
CSD are displayed in the bottom section.
Through reading the context in the corpus, the
human annotator decides to add or delete or edit a
sense entry in the lexicon. The default value of the
range of the context is within a sentence, and the
surrounding characters in the left and right of the
target word can be specified by the annotator. An-
notators can do four kinds of operations in CSD: 1)
Add a sense entry and then fill in all the features; 2)
Delete a sense entry along with all its feature de-
scription; 3) Edit a sense entry and change any of
the features; 4) Select a sample sentence form the
CSP and add it to the lexicon in the corresponding
sense entry.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989108">
127
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948145833333">
According to the sense specification in CSD the
human annotator assigns semantic tags to the word
occurrences in CSP. The operation is quite easy.
When the annotator double clicks the appropriate
sense entry in CSD the sense tag is automatically
added to the target word.
The notable feature in this word sense annotat-
ing interface is that it provides flexible searching
schemes. 1) Search sequentially (forward or back-
ward) all the instances of an ambiguous words re-
gardless of the annotating state; 2) Search sequen-
tially (forward or backward) the already annotated
instances; 3) Search sequentially (forward or back-
ward) the yet un-annotated instances and 4) Search
the instances of a specific ambiguous word (the
window named Find/Replace in figure3, and again
is shown in figure 4 for clearness).
The tool of Find/Replace is widely used in this
project and has proven to be effective in annotating
word senses. It allows the annotator to search for a
specific word to finish tagging all its occurrences
in the same period of time rather than move se-
quentially through the text. The consistency is
more easily kept when the annotator manages
many different instances of the same word than
handle a few occurrences of many different words
in a specific time frame, because the former
method enables the annotator to establish an inte-
grative knowledge system about a specific word
and its sense distinction. Also the tool of
Find/Replace provides flexible searching schemes
for a specific ambiguous word. For instance,
search in the corpus with different directions (for-
ward/backward) and search with different annotat-
ing states (annotated/un-annotated/both). Using the
tool the annotator can also replace some specific
word occurrences in the corpus (often with special
POS tags) with a sense tag, thus can finish annotat-
ing the corpus quickly and with a batch method.
For instance the POS tag of “vq” (means verb
complement) often uniquely corresponds to a spe-
cific verb sense such as “ff/vqÆff/vq!8”.
There is the status bar in the bottom line of the
word sense annotating interface, and there clearly
show the annotating status: the total word occur-
rences, the serial number of the current processing
instance and the number of the already annotated
instances.

3.2 Linking between CSD and CCD
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992916666667">
The feature-based description of word meanings in
CSD describes mainly the syntagmatic information,
such as the subcategory frames of verbs, the se-
mantic categories of the head noun of adjectives,
but cannot include the paradigmatic relations.
WordNet is a popular open resource and has been
widely experimented in WSD researches. Chinese
Concept Dictionary (CCD) is a WordNet-like Chi-
nese lexicon (Liu et al., 2002), which carries the
main relations defined in WordNet and can be seen
as a bilingual concept lexicon with the parallel
Chinese-English concepts to be simultaneously
included. So the linking between the sense entries
in CSD and the synsets in CCD is tried to establish
in this project. After the linking has been estab-
lished, the paradigmatic relations (such as hy-
pernym / hyponym, meronym / holonym) ex-
pressed in CCD can map automatically to the sense
entry in CSD. What’s more, the many existing
WSD approaches based on WordNet can be trained
and tested on the Chinese sense tagged corpus.
In the right section of the word sense annotating
interface there displays the synset information
from CCD. When coping with a specific ambigu-
ous word (such as “ff/open”) in CSD, the linking
between CSD and CCD is automatically estab-
lished with the word itself (“ff/open”) as the pri-
mary key. And then all the synsets of the word
(“ff/open”) in CCD, along with the hypernyms of
each sense (expressed by the first word in a synset),
are displayed in the right section. A synset selec-
tion window (namely Set synsets) containing the
offset numbers of the synsets then appears in the
right section. The annotator clicks on the appropri-
ate box(es) before the corresponding offset number
and then the offset number is automatically added

to the feature “CCD” in the currently selected
sense entry in CSD.
The linking is now done manually. Unfortu-
nately some of the ambiguous words existing in
CSD are not included in CCD. This also provides a
good way to improve the coverage and quality of
CCD.

4 Consistency Checking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950555555555">
Consistency is always an important concern for
hand-annotated corpus, and is even critical for the
sense tagged corpus due to the subtle meanings to
handle. A software tool namely Sense Consistency
Checker is developed in the checking procedure.
The checker extracts all the instances of a specific
ambiguous word into a checking file with the for-
mat of the sense concordances (as shown in figure
5 ). The checking file enables the checker to have a
closer examination of how the senses are used and
distributed, and to form a general view of how the
sense distinctions are made. The inter-annotator in-
agreement thus can be reached quickly and cor-
rectly. As illustrated in figure 5, it is obviously an
error to assign the same semantic tag to “ff/drive
1M4-&amp;quot;/car” and “�1Wmeeting ff/held”. Simply as
it is the checker greatly accelerates the checking
speed and improve the consistency.

Together five researchers took part in the anno-
tation, of which three are majored in linguistics
and two are majored in computational linguistics.
In this project the annotators are also checkers,
who check other annotators’ work. A text gener-
ally is first tagged by one annotator and then veri-
fied by two checkers.
After the preprocessing of word segmentation
and Pos tagging, the word sense annotating and
the consistency checking, the Chinese word sense
annotated corpus is constructed. And then other
software tools are needed to do further processing
in the sense annotated corpus.

5 XML format transforming
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977409090909">
The original format of the Chinese sense anno-
tated corpus is in text file as shown in figure 6. In
the text file the sign following “/” denotes the
POS tag, and the number following “!” indicates
the sense ID. The text file complies with the other
language resources at the Institute of Computa-
tional Linguistics, Peking University, which pro-
vides a quite easy way to make full use of the ex-
isting resources and techniques at ICL/PKU when
constructing the sense annotated corpus.
At the same time in order to exchange and
share information easily with other language re-
sources in the world, a software tool namely Text-
to-XML Transformer is developed to change the
text to XML format (as shown in figure 7). In the
XML file, the item “pos” denotes the POS tag of
the word, and the item “senseid” denotes sense ID
of the ambiguous word.
Thus there are two kinds of format for the Chi-
nese sense annotated corpus, each of which has its
advantages and can be adopted to meet different
requirements in different situations.

Word sense frequency distribution in the real texts
is a vital kind of information both for the algo-
rithms of word sense disambiguation and for the
research on lexical semantics. In the postprocess-
ing stage a software tool namely Sense Frequency
Counter is developed to make statistics on the
sense frequency distribution. Quite valuable in-
formation can be acquired through the counter
based on the sense annotated corpus: 1) The
amount of all the instances of an ambiguous word;
2) The number of the already annotated instances;
3) The occurrence of each sense of an ambiguous
word and 4) The sense frequency. Table 1 illus-
trates the sense frequency distribution of ambigu-
ous verb “开/open” in 10 day’s People’s Daily.

This paper describes the overall building proce-
dure of a Chinese sense annotated corpus. The
corpus is firstly word segmented and POS tagging
using Peking University’s tagger in the preproc-
essing stage. Then the lexicon Chinese Semantic
Dictionary (CSD) containing sense descriptions
and the corpus Chinese Senses Pool (CSP) anno-
tated with senses are built interactively, simulta-
neously and dynamically using the word sense
annotating interface. At the same time the linking
between the sense entries in CSD and the synsets
in Chinese Concept Dictionary (CCD) are manu-
ally established. And then the Sense Consistency
Checker is used to keep the inter-annotator
agreement. Finally two software tools are devel-
oped to do further processing based on the sense
annotated corpus. A software tool namely Text-to-
XML Transformer is developed to change the text

all the software tools have been experimented in
building the SemEval-2007 task 5 “Multilingual

Although much research has been carried out, there is still a long way to go for WSD techniques to meet the requirements of practical NLP programs such as machine translation and information retrieval. It was argued that no fundamental progress in WSD could be made until largescale lexical resources were built (Veronis, 2003). In English a word sense annotated corpus SEMCOR (Semantic Concordances) (Landes et al., 1999) has been built, which was later trained and tested by many WSD systems and stimulated large amounts of WSD work. In Japanese the Hinoki Sensebank is constructed (Tanaka et al., 2006). In the field of Chinese corpus construction, plenty of attention has been paid to POS tagging and syntactic structures bracketing, for instance the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002) and Sinica Corpus (Huang et al., 1992), but very limited work has been done with semantic knowledge annotation.

According to the research of Li (1999), after POS tagging the ratio of ambiguous word occurrences in the text of People’s Daily is reduced from 42% to 26%. Therefore the emphasis of manually sense annotating in this paper falls on the ambiguous words with the same part of speech. This will in turn save 16% of the annotation effort compared with the sense annotating before the preprocessing of POS tagging. 3 Word sense annotating The resulting lexical knowledge base in this project will contain three major components: 1) a corpus annotated with Chinese word senses namely Chinese Senses Pool (CSP); 2) a lexicon containing sense dist</context>

The corpus CSP, the lexicon CSD and CCD constitute a highly relational and tightly integrated system: 1) In CSD the sense distinctions are described relying on the corpus; 2) In CSP the word occurrences are assigned sense tags according to the sense en126 try specified in CSD; 3) The linking between the sense entry in CSD and CCD synsets are established. The dynamic model is shown in figure 2. A software tool is developed in Java to be used as the word sense annotating interface (figure 3), which embodies the spirit of the dynamic model properly. .

Fig.4 The tool of Find/Replace 3.2 Linking between CSD and CCD The feature-based description of word meanings in CSD describes mainly the syntagmatic information, such as the subcategory frames of verbs, the semantic categories of the head noun of adjectives, but cannot include the paradigmatic relations. WordNet is a popular open resource and has been widely experimented in WSD researches. Chinese Concept Dictionary (CCD) is a WordNet-like Chinese lexicon (Liu et al., 2002), which carries the main relations defined in WordNet and can be seen as a bilingual concept lexicon with the parallel Chinese-English concepts to be simultaneously included. So the linking between the sense entries in CSD and the synsets in CCD is tried to establish in this project. After the linking has been established, the paradigmatic relations (such as hypernym / hyponym, meronym / holonym) expressed in CCD can map automatically to the sense entry in CSD. What’s more, the many existing WSD approaches based on WordNet can be trained and tested on the Chinese sense tagged corpus. In the ri</context>

In section 2 the preprocessing stage (word segmentation and POS tagging) is discussed. Then in section 3 the annotating scheme and the annotating interface are demonstrated in detail. The strategy to keep consistency is addressed in section 4. And then in section 5 and 6 the two postprocessing stages are respectively presented. Finally in section 7 conclusions are drawn and future works are presented. 2 Word segmentation and POS tagging The input data for word sense annotating is firstly word segmented and POS tagged using Peking University’s POS tagger (Yu et al., 2003). The POS tagging precision is up to 97.5%, which lays a sound foundation for researches on sense annotating. This is actually to make use of the fullfledged syntactic processing techniques to deal with the semantic annotation problems. Different senses of one ambiguous word sometimes behave so differently that they bear different POS tags. Take “4r_�/hold” in sentence (1) as an example.
