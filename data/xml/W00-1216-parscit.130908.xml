This paper describes text meaning represen-
tation for Chinese. Text meaning representa-
tion is composed of a set of ontological concept
instances along with ontological links among
them. It integrates lexical, textual and world
knowledge into a single hierarchical frame-
work. In NLP application it serves as an inter-
lingual representation for various processing.
The methodology and implementation of text
meaning representation is discussed in detail.

In natural language text processing, it be-
comes inevitable to require a system having
capability to automatically extract and repre-
sent the information conveyed in a given text.
The theory and methodology of text mean-
ing representation (TMR) has been studied
in the past decade (Nirenburg, 1991; Ma-
hesh and Nirenburg, 1996; Beale et al., 1995;
Onyshkevych 1997) and its application has
been presented in machine translation sys-
tems that employ interlingual approach. An
ideal text meaning representation will be a
language-neutral description of the linguistic
information conveyed in a natural language
text. TMR captures the meanings of words in
the text and represents them in a set of onto-
logical concepts interconnected through onto-
logical relations. In addition, TMR provides
information about the lexicon-semantic de-
pendencies as well as stylistic factors. Based
on this study, two supportive resources to
compose TMR are ontology and semantic lex-
icon. An ontology is a set of knowledge con-
cepts about the world. It is composed of thou-

sands of concepts organized into a particular
hierarchy so that each concept is related to
other concepts through semantic links (Carl-
son et al., 1990; Bateman, 1993; Dowell et al.
1995; Nirenburg et al., 1995; Bouaud, et al,
1995; Mahesh et al. 1995;). Semantic lexicon
represents the senses of the words. Each lex-
icon entry is a framework that maps a word
sense to an ontological concept. It also in-
cludes information about syntax, semantics,
morphology and pragmatics, as well as anno-
tation that keep the record of data manage-
ment. Over the years, various methodologies
have been investigated carrying out the struc-
ture of a computational lexicon entry within a
knowledge-based framework(Onyshkevych et
at, 1995; Viegas and Raskin, 1998; Viegas,
1999; Viegas, et al, 1998a, 1998b). A semantic
parser uses information in the semantic lexi-
con and makes a decision on word sense dis-
ambiguation based on the strategy proposed
by Beale et al. (1995) and Beale(1997).
This paper presents the development and
application of text meaning representation
for Chinese. Detailed discussion about the
principle for building a computational se-
mantic Chinese lexicon is illustrated in Jin
(1999). The methodology and implementa-
tion of word sense disambiguation is fully dis-
cussed in Viegas, Jin and Beale(1999a, 19991),
1999c).

2 Overview of Ontology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957571428571">
An ontology is a body of knowledge about
the world. It is a repository of concepts used
in meaning representations. All concepts are
organized in a tangled subsumption hierar-
chy and further interconnected using a system
of semantic relations defined among the con-
cepts. The ontology is put into well-defined

<bodyText confidence="0.996602181818182">
relationships with knowledge sources in the
system. In an NLP application the ontology
supplies world knowledge to lexical, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic processes.
In the IVEkroKosmos project,2 the ontolog-
ical concepts consist of: OBJECT, the static
things existing in the world; EVENT, any ac-
tivities happening in the world, and PROP-
ERTY, the properties of OBJECTS and EVENTs.
The ontology organizes terminological nouns
into a taxonomy of objects, verbs into a taxon-
omy of events, and adjectives into a taxonomy
of attributes. It further includes many onto-
logical relations between objects and events
to support a variety of disambiguation tasks.
Currently, the ontology in the MikroKosmos
project contains about 5,000 concepts cover-
ing a wide range of categories in the world.
Each concept, on average, has 14 relation
links. An example below presents the top
three level of the ontology, which differentiates
between OBJECT; EVENT and PROPERTY.

Each concept is a frame in which a col-
lection of ontological slots such as DEFINI-
TION, IS-A, SUBCLASSES, INVERSE; case roles
such as AGENT, THEME and properties such
as HEADED-BY, HAS-MEMBER, etc. link one
concept to other concepts in the ontology.
Below is an example of a concept frame of
GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY:
&apos;The MikroKosmos project is a knowledge-based
machine translation system using an interlingual ap-
proach. The source languages are Spanish, Chinese
and Japanese. The target language is English.

<bodyText confidence="0.998819181818182">
This example indicates that the concept
GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY is a subclass of
the concept POLITICAL-EVENT; its case role
AGENT requires its semantic value as HUMAN
and its THEME requires its value as either OB-
JECT or EVENT; the GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY
can also have case role ACCOMPANIER with
value as HUMAN and LOCATION with value as
PLACE. Any lexicon entry mapping to the con-
cept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY gets extended
information through this frame.

3 Semantic Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674363636364">
Semantic lexicon is another knowledge source
for text meaning representation. In the
MikroKosmos project each lexicon entry is de-
signed as a frame with 11 zones corresponding
to information relevant to orthography, mor-
phology, syntax, semantics, syntax-semantic
linking, stylistics, and database type manage-
ment record, etc. The core of the lexicon
frame is syntactic zone SYN-STRUC, semantic
zone SEM-STRUC and their link SYNSEM zone.
Syntax particular to a given language is de-
scribed in the syntactical zone. The semantic
zone maps a sense into an ontological concept
in the case of single sense, or to several con-
cepts in the case of multiple senses. Through
the syntactic-semantic link zone the informa-
tion of each word in the text can be extracted
directly from lexicon database and its relevant
world knowledge also can be retrieved. The
general template of semantic lexicon entry is
shown as follows. For a detailed description
see Viegas and Raskin (1998).

dicates that when parsing a sentence contain-

required. The SEM zone presents the semantic
value of each case role, i.e. AGENT with value
HUMAN, and THEME with value EVENT or OB-
JECT. The SYNSEM zone provides information
about the syntax-semantic linking. That is,
SUBJ El is linked to AGENT m with value
HUMAN and OBJ El is linked to THEME

Due to the lack of morphological informa-
tion in Chinese, it is often the case that the
same Chinese word form can be mapped to
a different part of speech and has multiple
senses, such as the word 3:F tt:

Syntactic variables are bound to one an-
other using the syntactic patterns in the
lexical entries to establish syntactic de-
pendencies. In addition, ontological con-
cepts referred to the semantic zones of
the lexical entries are instantiated and
linked through ontological relations to es-
tablish semantic dependencies. For ex-
ample, the syntactic structure of the text
requires 7F to be a verb. Thus, the ADJ
category with sense OPEN-TO-PUBLIC-2-4
is rejected. From Figure 2. and Figure
3. both SYN zones indicate an intransi-
tive verb that violates the required syn-
tax. Therefore, the concepts BLOOM and
OPEN-TO-PUBLIC are also rejected. In
the same way, the adverb 1-1-4 with sense
OUTWARD-5-2 and the verb 51 a with
sense COMMERCE-EVENT-4-2 are also re-
jected because of the violation of required
POS. Finally the ADJ V-34- with the sense
INTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5-1 and the
NOUN Ria with COMMERCE-EVENT-4-1
are selected. After all senses are de-
termined, SYN-SEM zone binds all syn-
tactic variables with semantic variables,
i.e. SUBJ FEDERATION-1 is bound to
the AGENT of GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-

GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2-2.

• Seeking satisfaction through inference

ontological search program, Onto-Search,
is presented in Onyshkevych (1997). The
resulting preference values for each con-
straint are combined in an efficient con-
trol and search algorithm called Hunter-
Gatherer that combines constraint satis-
faction, branch and bound, and solution
synthesis techniques to pick the best com-
bination of word senses of the entire sen-
tence in near linear time, as described in

5 Text Meaning Representation

<bodyText confidence="0.986828285714286">
A text meaning representation (TMR) is a
language-neutral description of the meaning
conveyed in a text. It is derived by syn-
tactic and semantic analysis. TMR captures
not only the meaning of individual words in
the text, but also the relation between those
words. It provides information about the
lexicon-semantic dependencies. In addition, it
also represents stylistic and other factors pre-
sented in the text. From the result of word
sense disambiguation, TMR integrates lexical,
ontological and textual information into a sin-
gle hierarchical framework. Below is a TMR

6 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930977777778">
A knowledge-based machine translation can
be viewed as extracting and representing the
meaning of a text and generating a text in
target language based on the meaning pre-
sented. Thus, text meaning representation
plays the key role in an interlingual approach
to machine translation. The approach de-
scribed in this article enables integrating lin-
guistic knowledge of source languages with
general world knowledge to reach high qual-
ity translation. It is because TMR represents
meaning deeper and broader than what the
context presents. For example, in the con-
text M JR* provide service, the linguistic
information indicates syntactic-semantic de-
pendency as SUBJ(human) -V(service-event)-
OBJ (event). In an ontology, the SERVICE-
EVENT concept frame contains information
about AGENT and THEME as well as BENEFI-
CIARY, ACCOMPANIER, INSTRUMENT, LOCA-
TION, etc. which extends the meaning of the
given text A% SE* to *A tE A Yg AA IA
IA NI* Someone provides service to someone
else at some place. If the extended informa-
tion is not explicitly presented in the text, the
default value provides the assumption based
on the world knowledge. In machine transla-
tion, it enables the generation of high quality
text, especially in the case where the syntax
in source language is different from that in
target language or in the case where ellipsis
is allowed in one language such as He plays
Bach in English, but is not allowed in other
language such as in Chinese, where one must
say fth N4* E. Ith ffa He plays Bach&apos;s work.
With the rapid development of internet, in-
formation retrieval plays the key role in search
engin. The extended information about the
world knowledge allows to retrieve relevant
data through the ontology that is implicitly
specified in the query. As result, more broad
and deep information can be extracted. It is
extremely valuable to the development of next
generation of Internet search engin. All in all,
using ontology strengthens all NLP systems.

The theory and methodology of text meaning representation (TMR) has been studied in the past decade (Nirenburg, 1991; Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1996; Beale et al., 1995; Onyshkevych 1997) and its application has been presented in machine translation systems that employ interlingual approach.
