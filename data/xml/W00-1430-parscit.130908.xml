When generating utterances, humans may choose
among a number of alternative sentence forms ex-
pressing the same propositional content. The con-
text determines these decisions to a large extent.
This paper presents a strategy to allow for such
context-sensitive variation when generating text for
a wearable, advice giving device. Several dimen-
sions of context feed a model of the hearer&apos;s atten-
tion space, which, in terms of Information Structure
Theory, determines the form of the sentence to be
generated.

Discourse pragmatics research, mainly in view of NI,
understanding, reveals a loose coupling between a
range of grammatical markers (morpho-syntax, word
order and also prosody) and difficult to verify mental
categories such as &apos;given&apos; and &apos;new&apos;. While unpre-
dictability seems an inherent property of pragmatic
phenomena (Verschueren, 1995) we want to exper-
Unentally introduce the observed variability in an
NLG device to investigate its communicative effect.
Our practical goal is to enhance the effectiveness of
a wearable device that provides spoken advice to
a user operating in a real-world physical environ-
ment. Given a particular pragmatic context„ one
or another formulation is more appropriate w r.t.
communicative success (Hove, 1990). We focus on
the hearer&apos;s context (as perceived by the speaker).

pect of addressee tuning. Taking into account mul-
tiple context dimensions acquired in real-time dis-
tinguishes our approach, also from other NLG re-
search concerned with user adaptation, where only
discourse and/or user profile are considered (e.g.
(Krahmer and Theune, 1998; Paris, 1988)) or time
and space from a linguistic-theoretical perspective
(Maybury, 1991).
The work reported here is part of the COMR1S1
project. In an information-rich situation (e.g. when
visiting a conference), a user receives relevant advice
(e.g. about interesting talks, interesting persons in
the neighbourhood) from her &apos;parrot&apos; (see figure 1 ) 2
Related research issues in C&apos;OMRIS are physical
context sensing and information focusing through
agents&apos; competition for the attention of the user
(Van de &apos;Wide et al., 1998). Context-sensitive text
generation contributes to the latter and depends on
the former. We earlier investigated how context de-
termines the text generation process at, the level of
word choice (Geiclof, 19996). We proposed a multi-
dimensional context model, encompassing discourse

history, physical context and user profile (Geldof,
1999a). Real-time information about these differ-
ent perspectives annotates the input structure of the
template-based NLG component. We use TG/2,
a rule-based engine that covers the continuum be-
tween templates and syntactic generation (Buse-
mann, 1996). Making abstraction from planning and
mutti-sententional discourse phenomena allows us to
focus on the subject of our research: context sensi-
tivity and surface form. In this paper, we want to
uncover how context affects the structure of utter-
ances (vs lexical choice).
Section 2 presents the different steps of our ap-
proach: context modeling (2.1), information struc-
ture analysis (2.2), applied discourse pragmatics
(2.3) and NLG strategy (2.4). Section 3 illustrates
these ideas through scenarios and we conclude (sec-

<bodyText confidence="0.976433789473684">
Our goal is to obtain a less intrusive device through
context sensitivity of the spoken output. The
presupposition is that utterances anchored to the
hearer&apos;s multidimensional context will require less
cognitive effort to attend to. Our strategy is based
on the discourse pragmatic account for grammatical
differences between utterances expressing the same
propositional content. Figure 2 shows how we envi-
sion the connection between various disciplines re-
lating context to utterance form.
Context is considered to activate particular men-
tal representations in the hearer&apos;s mind (modeled as
her attention space). In order to be communicative,
the speaker hypothesises about this attention space
and structures his utterance accordingly. Informa-
tion Structure Theory accounts for this adaptation
process. We use our earlier context rnoclel and de-

Context perception and adaptation are important
in research on wearable technologies. Nomadic Ra-
dio (Sawhney and Schmandt, 1999) adapts informa-
tion delivery (news, email, phone-calls) to the user&apos;s
physical environment through varying output sound
technology. Remembrance agents act like memory
extensions by pointing to related information in ap-
propriate contexts (De Vaul et al., 2000). Neither

interaction between physical and hypertext. naviga-
tion for a wearable museum guide. Schmidt and
colleagues provide a platform for inferring the rela-

When dealing with content delivery to human users.
the use and interpretation of symbolic data in combi-
nation with quantitative data remains an important
issue on the research agenda. Our context model is
a first proposal in that direction.
When focusing on lexical phenomena like (fete-
tic expressions (this afternoon, here) and anaphora
(she, the same topic) or the inclusion of appositions
related to the hearer&apos;s profile (one of your favourite
topics), we proposed a three-dimensional context
model (see figure 3) in order to generate truly con-
text sensitive expressions. Objects mentioned t.0 the

in space and time is monitored via beacons. The
Information Layer provides user profile information

tional reasoning on the time and location indexes in
terms of the activity of the user (cfr. 2.3). Indeed,
knowing which kind of activity the user is involved in
at each moment (i.e. the ontology instances involved
in that activity) we hypothesise on which person and
keyword the user&apos;s attention is focused on.

2.2 Attention focus and Information
Structure Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997763487179487">
Other researchers have investigated attention focus
in larger spans of discourse (McCoy and Cheng,
1991; Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and in dialogue (Joki-
nen et al., 1998). Corpus analysis (Rats, 1996)
confirms the existence of a mechanism called topic,
through which interlocutors strive at discourse co-
herence to reduce the cognitive effort of the hearer.
The terminology used in the different frameworks
is confusing, even contradictory (Bosch and van der
Sandt, 1999). Information Structure Theory (Lam-
brecht, 1994) accounts for exactly those phenomena
we are interested in: grammatical differences be-
tween allo-sentences (expressing the same semantic
content). Lambrecht considers information struc-
ture as an integral part of the grammar of natu-
ral languages. After determining what to say, a
speaker structures this information in terms of his
own presupposition of the hearer&apos;s attention state.
Identifiability (whether a shared representation ex-
ists in both interlocutors&apos; minds) and activation sta-
tus (how much a known representation is at the
forefront of the hearer&apos;s mind (Chafe, 1987)) deter-
mine pragmatic role assignments. Topic, the role
of aboutness is attributed to a discourse referent
that is identifiable and more or less active. Focus
is the unpredictable part of the utterance. Whereas
all utterances have a focus (in order to be com-
municative), some may be topic-less. Lambrecht
distinguishes 3 types of sentence constructions (ac-
cording to whether the predicate, the argument or
the whole sentence is in focus&apos;) and demonstrates
through grammatical analysis, that the first. con-
struction is the most natural one. Languages use
different grammatical markers to realise informa-
tion structure and there is no one-to-one correspon-
dence between grammatical markers (e.g definite-
ness, pronominalization, accentuation) and topic or

There is no content-based discourse planning in
COMRIS. The propositional content of parrot mes-
sages is provided by agents that represent particular
user interests in the virtual world. A mechanism
of competition for attention determines whether a
message will actually be pushed to the user. As a
.consequence-, the-sentences to-be generated are topic-
less: each message conveys only new information, as
if answering the hypothetical question: &apos;what is ap-
propriate for me to do now?&apos;. Thus they bare the
danger of coming &apos;out of the blue&apos;, as in the following
sequence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979328166666667">
• &amp;quot;There will be an interesting presentation by
Amanda Huggenkiss about &apos;knowledge systems
and Al&apos;.&amp;quot; (propagandist message)
• &amp;quot;Enric Plaza proposes to meet you to discuss
about &apos;machine learning&apos;.&amp;quot; (appointment pro-
posal)
• &amp;quot;Josep Arcos, who shares your interest in
&apos;agents&apos;, is currently in your neighbourhood.&amp;quot;

<bodyText confidence="0.999974727272727">
The intuition that such a sequence is not ideal from
the communicative point of view, confirms our in-
terpretation of information structure theory in view
of communicative effect. Whereas topic expression
creates discourse continuity (i.e. links the message
to the context in a broad sense: an active mental
representation), topic-less sentences Can be assumed
to require a higher cognitive effort from the hearer.
Therefore our communicative strategy for COMRIS
will be to look for a topic candidate within a given
propositional content.. To he communicatively niore
effective, we try to somehow link a message to I he
attention space or the user-hearer.
Obviously, the hearer&apos;s mind is a black box and
all we can do is hypothesise about the activation
of mental representations by contextual factors Inc
line with our previous work, we argue that the 3
dimensions of the user&apos;s context (linguistic, physical
and profile) should be taken into account. Given the
COMRIS ontology, the attention state model can be
represented as a simple tree structure (see cam pies
in section 3): each utterance conveys information

about an event characterised by a key-word (-list),
involving a person,. and possibly a time/location
specification. Thus we will search in the hearer&apos;s
discourse and physical context which are the acti-
vated instances of the concepts event, person, key-
word and time/location. To find out which instances
are contributed by the physical context, we hypoth-
esise about the user&apos;s current activity by comparing
her physical position with the conference programme
or her agenda. For instance, if we know that the
user is attending a particular presentation, we can
query the conference-program for the speaker and
the keywords of that presentation. Alternatively, if
the user&apos;s physical location confirms that she attends
an appointment, her agenda will reveal the name of
the person she&apos;s meeting and maybe some topics of
discussion. Any of these instances may also carry
context annotation w.r.t. the user&apos;s interest profile.

2.4 NLG strategy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960791333333333">
Assignment of topic and focus follows from our ap-
plication of Information Structure Theory to the dis-
course pragmatic situation in COMRIS. Our search
for a topic candidate in the NLG input structure
considers time pressure first, then the activation
of entities via discourse or activity and finally the
hearer&apos;s interest profile, as detailed in the following
rules:
1. (physical context first) If the NLG input struc-
ture contains a time expression that is anno-
tated as being very close to the current point in
time (physical context value), then let the time
expression he the topic, opening the sentence
and carrying a prosodic accent. The sentence
structure is predicate focus.
e.g. Please note that, within FIVE, miNUTES,
you have to give a presentation on &apos;NATURAL
LANGUAGE GENERATION AND CONTEXT&apos;.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8824326">
2. (topic candidate in attention space) If one of the
entities of the input structure is also present,
in the (hearer&apos;s) attention space map, let it be
the topic, realised as an unaccented pronoun
(preferred topic marking) in case it occurred in
the immediate linguistic coutext or as a left-
dislocated constituent in case it was present in
the physical context..
e.g. She will give a presentation on KNOWL-

profile value (indicating the hearer&apos;s interest in
that keyword. or person). If the physical context
also allows topic shift, use an argument focus
structure (after introducing the new topic):
e.g. Someone interested in &apos;AGENTS&apos; is in your
neighbourhood. It&apos;s JOSEP ARc0s6.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998552333333333">

The scenarios below will further concretise the rela-
tionship between context, attention space and topic-
focus assignment, but the above examples already il-
lustrate our main point. The first 3 rules are aimed
at linking an element of the propositional content to
.
the user&apos;s attention focus, in virtue of the preceding
discourse, the physical context or her interest pro-
file. Topic expression often leads to de-accentuation.
In other words, rule 4 applies when there is no way
to anchor the utterance to the user&apos;s context and re-
quires to accent every information entity. Empirical
experiments will have to verify the hypothesis that
the non-default sentence constructions are perceived
as less intrusive.

enough-, constitutes the linguistic context (Icy), the

In this paper we proposed an NLG strategy that
relates aspects of the hearer&apos;s multidimensional con-
text to grammatical variations of sentences. The in-
terpretation of the COMM pragmatic situation in
terms of Information Structure Theory leads to de-
creasing the hearer&apos;s cognitive effort by linking the
propositional content to her broad context. This
is marked grammatically in the resulting utterance.
Although the details may be application dependent,
we believe the general idea holds for context-aware
verbal interaction on wearable devices. Experiments
in another application area would involve the elab-
oration of another ontology and might reveal other
grammatical markers. We see some limitations and
challenges for further research. The approach criti-
cally depends on progress in context capturing and
especially its high-level interpretation (Schmidt et
al., 1999). The use of more sophisticated Al tech-
niques could account for the uncertainty involved in
attention space modeling and the indeterminism in
mapping pragmatic features to grammatical mark-
ers. As more hardware and software becomes avail-
able and integrated towards the end of the COMRIS
project, we plan to perform real-world experiments.
We can already evaluate our strategy by comparing
results from generation with and -without consider-
ing context, the former producing more varying and
more natural output. Our major contribution con-
sists in linking work on focus of attention to real-
time monitoring and modeling of different hearer
context dimensions and in providing a framework for

<abstract confidence="0.994496916666667">When generating utterances, humans may choose among a number of alternative sentence forms expressing the same propositional content. The context determines these decisions to a large extent. This paper presents a strategy to allow for such context-sensitive variation when generating text for a wearable, advice giving device. Several dimensions of context feed a model of the hearer&apos;s attention space, which, in terms of Information Structure Theory, determines the form of the sentence to be generated.</abstract>

In this paper, we want to uncover how context affects the structure of utterances (vs lexical choice).

Lambrecht considers information structure as an integral part of the grammar of natural languages. After determining what to say, a speaker structures this information in terms of his own presupposition of the hearer&apos;s attention state. Identifiability (whether a shared representation exists in both interlocutors&apos; minds) and activation status (how much a known representation is at the forefront of the hearer&apos;s mind (Chafe, 1987)) determine pragmatic role assignments. Topic, the role of aboutness is attributed to a discourse referent that is identifiable and more or less active. Focus is the unpredictable part of the utterance. Whereas all utterances have a focus (in order to be communicative), some may be topic-less. Lambrecht distinguishes 3 types of sentence constructions (according to whether the predicate, the argument or the whole sentence is in focus&apos;) and demonstrates through grammatical analysis, that the first. construction is the most natural one.

Taking into account multiple context dimensions acquired in real-time distinguishes our approach, also from other NLG research concerned with user adaptation, where only discourse and/or user profile are considered (e.g. (Krahmer and Theune, 1998; Paris, 1988)) or time and space from a linguistic-theoretical perspective (Maybury, 1991). The work reported here is part of the COMR1S1 project. In an information-rich situation (e.g. when visiting a conference), a user receives relevant advice (e.g. about interesting talks, interesting persons in the neighbourhood) from her &apos;parrot&apos; (see figure 1 ) 2 Related research issues in C&apos;OMRIS are physical context sensing and information focusing through agents&apos; competition for the attention of the user (Van de &apos;Wide et al., 1998).
