<bodyText confidence="0.999800631578947">
Parallel text is one of the most valuable
resources for development of statistical
machine translation systems and other
NLP applications. However, manual
translations are very costly, and the
number of known parallel text is limited.
Hence, our research started with creating
and collecting a large amount of parallel
text resources for Indonesian-English.
We describe in this paper the creation of
parallel corpora: ANTARA News, BPPT-
PANL and BTEC-ATR. In order to be
useful, these resources must be available
in reasonable quantities and qualities to
be useful for statistical approaches to
language processing. We describe
problem and solution as well robust tools
and annotation schema to build and
process these corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999975111111111">
In recent years, our research focuses in
developing Open Source Toolkit for English-
Indonesian translation system. We need to build
a good quality with reasonable size of parallel
corpus in Indonesian-English. We started by
collecting Indonesian corpus and perform raw
corpus cleaning, translation, alignment and
XML tagging. The alignment at sentence levels
makes parallel corpora both more interesting
and more useful. As long as parallel corpora
exist, sentence aligned parallel corpora is an
issue which is solved by sentence aligners. In
our case, the alignment is performed manually
by hand while doing the actual translation.
The task that was carried out by us in
gathering corpus was conducted in several
stages. Until now, we had several collections
from various resources. Among them is the
collection of ANTARA News corpus, collection
of BPPT-PANL corpus and collection of BTEC-
ATR corpus. Respectively this work had
various Domain (National News, International
News, Business/Economy, Politics, Science,
Technology, and Sport) and different sources
(News agency, Online Publisher, International
institution) leading toward different handling
and process.

<bodyText confidence="0.99992475">
ANTARA is the national news agency of
Indonesia that has a collection of news articles
available in two languages, Bahasa Indonesia
and English. ANTARA develop a large news
collection for the last 10 years, for various
domains, i.e. political news, economics news,
international news, national news, sport news,
science news and entertainment news. All of
these news articles were stored in a database
system (Oracle) as comparable corpora and the
structure of the database did not have the key
pairs between one news article written in
Indonesian and the one in English news article.
At the beginning, we had a long tedious
process for reaching an agreement between the
two sides, ANTARA and BPPT. We asked
permission to use these data for our researches
to develop automatic translation which in return
will help ANTARA’s journalist and reporters
for translation. In addition, the resulting work
will benefit both ANTARA and BPPT in the
form of alignment of news articles and key pairs
for database improvement.
The main problem is transforming this
comparable corpus into parallel corpus. We
should distinguish between Parallel Corpora
with Comparable Corpora. The latter
(comparable corpora) are texts in different

languages with the same main topic. A set of
news articles, from journals or news broadcast
systems, as they refer the same event in
different languages can be considered as
Comparable Corpora. Consider a news item
about the September 11 tragedy. Different
newspapers, in different languages will refer the
World Trade Center, airplanes, Bin Laden and a
lot of other specific words. This is the case of
Comparable Corpora which can be used by
translators who know day-to-day language but
need to learn how to translate a specific term.

<bodyText confidence="0.999078392857143">
The number of data’s that was used is
between the period of year 2000 to 2007 and the
articles were taken in stages, in SQL format,
amounting to 250.000 sentence pairs (2.5
Million words). These data, afterwards was
processed by referring to the news title in
respective article to become article pairs. After
this article fitting was finished, the next step
was to make the pairs of sentence and then the
result was store in a new table of database. The
work scheme of ANTARA corpus collection is
given below in Figure 1.
During the alignment process, the sentences
were reviewed manually, by means of election
against the quality of the translations. The
toggle cleaning stage is used for the process of
cleaning of the punctuation mark like [? ! “ ”
‘ ’ : ; {}]. Afterwards, these sentences pairs was
separated into two documents, each for
Indonesian and English and put into SGML
format. Attention has to be made to keep the
consistency of translation from the comparable
corpora into parallel corpora.
The ANTARA corpus is used for building
machine translation using an open source
MOSES SMT. It can be reported here that the
BLEU score of 0.76 can be reached by using 1
Million words training set.

We have collected corpora in Bahasa Indonesia
covering various domains. This corpus is
collected from various online sources which we
can apply Creative Commons IPR to its content
[2].
Translation, in our project definition, is the
semantic and syntactic transfer from a sentence
written in Bahasa Indonesia to a sentence in
English language. This definition is rigidly
constructed, in order to preserve sentence
alignment between the original text and the
target text in English.
If we are going to translate and align
sentences, then obviously we must clarify what
we understand by sentence. While most people
have strong intuitions about what is a sentence

and what is not, there is no universal definition
of that notion. Before we set out on devising
one, however, it should be noted that because
PANL-BPPT Corpus is primarily intended to be
used as a training text for statistical machine
translation systems, both the exact translation
and the actual segmentation of the text that
results from translation are crucially important.
Our main concern in this regard was to come
up with some guidelines for translation that
would be both practical for the translators and
aligners as well as it is useful for the end-users
of the corpus. We started out with something
relatively straightforward, which we then
expanded as needed.
Of course, given the relative vagueness of the
definitions of sentence and translation given
above, it was clear that in many situations,
arbitrary decisions would have to be made. Our
human aligners were instructed to be as
consistent as possible. But even then, because of
the repetitive nature of the task, errors had to be
expected.

3.2 Alignment of Parallel Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991117647059">
A parallel text alignment describes the relations
that exist between a text and its translation.
These relations can be viewed at various levels
of granularity: between text divisions,
paragraphs, sentences, propositions, words,
even characters. While it would certainly have
been interesting to produce finer-grain
alignments, it was decided that BPPT-PANL
Corpus would record correspondences at the
level of sentences. This decision was based on a
number of factors.
First, sentence-level alignments have so far
proved very useful in a number of applications,
which could be characterized as high recall, low
precision applications, i.e. applications where it
is more important to have all the answers to a
specific question than to have only the good
ones.
Secondly is the automatic acquisition of
information about translation, as was proposed
in [1] as part of a project to build a machine
translation system entirely based on statistical
knowledge. Such statistical models need to be
trained with large quantities of parallel text.
Intuitively, the ideal training material for this
task would be parallel text aligned at the level of
words. Yet, because these models picture the
translation process in an extremely simplified
manner, reliable statistical estimates can
nevertheless be obtained from much less precise
data, such as pairs of sentences.
For all these reasons, we decided that it
would be more appropriate initially to
concentrate on sentence-level alignments.
Furthermore, we decided to restrict ourselves to
“non-crossing” alignments, which is a parallel
segmentation of the two texts, into an equal
number of segments, such that the nth segment
in one text and the nth segment in the other text
are translations of one another [4].
It was suggested that all the texts would be
aligned twice, each time by a different aligner.
The resulting alignments would then be
compared, so as to detect any discrepancies
between the two. The aligners were then asked
to conciliate these differences together. Because
the entire BPPT-PANL corpus was aligned by
the same two aligners, this way of proceeding
not only minimized the number of errors; it also
ensured that both aligners had the same
understanding of the guidelines.

3.3 Corpus Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998858714285714">
SGML and XML played a major part in the
BNC project [3] which serve as an interchange
medium between the various data-providers, as
a target application-independent format; and as
the vehicle for expression of metadata and
linguistic interpretations encoded within the
corpus.
From the start of the project, it was
recognized that we have to choose a standard
format such as TEI P4 or XML in order to
maintain the corpus for long term storage and
also enable distribution of the data. The
importance of XML as an application
independent encoding format is also becoming
apparent, as a wide range of applications for it
begin to be realized.
The basic structural mark up of texts may be
summarized as follows. Each of the documents
or text source articles making up the corpus is
represented by a single &lt;corpus&gt; element,
containing a header &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;language&gt;,
and followed by sentence ID &lt;number&gt;.
The header element contains detailed and
richly structured metadata supplying a variety of
contextual information about the document (its
domain, source, encoding, etc., as defined by
the Text Encoding Initiative).
Sample tagging for English as follows:

BTEC was the abbreviation from Basic Travel

everyday normal conversational speech mostly
use in traveling and tourism. The source corpus
was in monolingual English belonging to NICT-
ATR Japan.
As part of A-STAR project cooperation [5],
our task was to do the manual translation from
English to Indonesian. Similar to the method
that was used in developing BPPT-PANL
corpus collection; we developed 153.000
utterances into parallel corpora. Additionally,
we developed POS Tagging, syllabification and
word-stress into this corpus. The main
difference was BPPT-PANL originated in
monolingual Indonesian that was taken from the
domain international, national, economics, sport
and science whereas BTEC-ATR originated in
speech of English in the travel domain.
