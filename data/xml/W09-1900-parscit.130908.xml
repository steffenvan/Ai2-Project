Welcome to the workshop on Active Learning for Natural Language Processing!
We started organizing this workshop in mid-2008 after strong encouragement in response to some of
our own work in the area. As we gathered members of the program committee, the timeliness of the
topic resonated with several of them: the growing body of knowledge on active learning and on active
learning for NLP in particular makes this topic one worth exploring in a focused workshop rather than
in isolated papers in occasional, far-flung conferences.
Labeled data is a prerequisite for many popular algorithms in natural language processing and machine
learning. While it is possible to obtain large amounts of annotated data for well-studied languages
in well-studied domains and well-studied problems, labeled data are rarely available for less common
languages, domains, or problems. Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations for linguistic data is
labor-intensive and typically the costliest part of the acquisition of an annotated corpus. It has been
shown before that active learning can be employed to reduce annotation costs but not at the expense of
quality. While diverse work over the past decade has demonstrated the possible advantages of active
learning for corpus annotation and NLP applications, active learning is not widely used in many ongoing
data annotation tasks. Much of the machine learning literature on the topic has focused on active
learning for classification problems with less attention devoted to the kinds of problems encountered
in NLP. Related topics such as distributed “human computation”, cost-sensitive machine learning, and
semi-supervised learning of all kinds are also growing in number as we search for the best ways to
overcome the data acquisition bottleneck.
We were interested in bringing together researchers to explore the challenges and opportunities of
active learning for NLP tasks, language acquisition, and language learning, and we have been rewarded
with excellent submissions and a promising program. The workshop received sixteen submissions,
eight of which are included in the final program. Two of the accepted papers are short papers which
address ongoing work and pertinent issues. We hope that this gathering and these proceedings begin to
shed more light on active learning for NLP classification tasks, sequence labeling, parsing, semantics,
and other more complex tasks. The papers in the program also begin to address issues involving the
application of active learning in real annotation projects.
We are especially grateful to the diverse and helpful program committee, whose reviews were careful
and thoughtful. We are also grateful to all of the researchers who submitted their work for consideration.
For the record, more information about the workshop is available online at http://nlp.cs.byu.edu/alnlp/.
