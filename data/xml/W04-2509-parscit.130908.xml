Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999731058823529">
A novel challenge for evaluating open-domain
question answering technologies is proposed.
In this challenge, question answering systems
are supposed to be used interactively to an-
swer a series of related questions, whereas in
the conventional setting, systems answer iso-
lated questions one by one. Such an interac-
tion occurs in the case of gathering informa-
tion for a report on a specific topic, or when
browsing information of interest to the user. In
this paper, first, we explain the design of the
challenge. We then discuss its reality and show
how the capabilities measured by the challenge
are useful and important in practical situations,
and that the difficulty of the challenge is proper
for evaluating the current state of open-domain
question answering technologies.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927388235294">
Open-domain question answering technologies allow
users to ask a question in natural language and obtain
the answer itself rather than a list of documents that con-
tain the answer. These technologies make it possible
to retrieve information itself rather than merely docu-
ments, and will lead to new styles of information access
(Voorhees, 2000).
The recent research on open-domain question answer-
ing concentrates on answering factoid questions one by
one in isolation from each other. Such systems that an-
swer isolated factoid questions are the most basic level of
question answering technologies, and will lead to more
sophisticated technologies that can be used by profes-
sional reporters and information analysts. On some stage
of that sophistication, a cub reporter writing an article on
a specific topic will be able to translate the main issue ad-
dressed by his report into a set of simpler questions and
then pose those questions to the question answering sys-
tem (Burger et al., 2001).
In addition, there is a relation between multi-document
summarization and question answering. In his lecture,
Eduard Hovy mentioned that multi-document summa-
rization may be able to be reduced into a series of ques-
tion answering (Hovy, 2001). In SUMMAC, an intrinsic
evaluation was conducted which measures the extent to
which a summary provides answers to a set of obligatory
questions on a given topic (Mani et al., 1998). Those sug-
gest such question answering systems that can answer a
series of related questions would surely be a useful aid to
summarization work by human and by machine.
Against this background, question answering systems
need to be able to answer a series of questions, which
have a common topic and/or share a local context. In
this paper, we propose a challenge to measure objectively
and quantitatively such an ability of question answering
systems. We call this challenge QACIAD (Question An-
swering Challenge for Information Access Dialogue). In
this challenge, question answering systems are used in-
teractively to participate in dialogues for accessing infor-
mation. Such information access dialogue occurs such
as when gathering information for a report on a specific
topic, or when browsing information of interest to the
user. Actually, in QACIAD, the interaction is only simu-
lated and systems answer a series of questions in a batch
mode. Although such a simulation may neglect the in-
herent dynamics of dialogue, it is a practical compromise
for objective evaluation and, as a result, the test sets of
the challenge are reusable.
Question answering systems need a wide range of abil-
ities in order to participate in information access dia-
logues (Burger et al., 2001). First, the systems must re-
spond in real time to make interaction possible. They
must also properly interpret a given question within the
context of a specific dialogue, and also be cooperative
by adding appropriate information not mentioned explic-
itly by the user. Moreover, the systems should be able
to pose a question for clarification to resolve ambiguity
concerning the user’s goal and intentions, and to partici-
pate in mixed initiative dialogue by making suggestions
and leading the user toward solving the problem. Among
these various capabilities, QACIAD focuses on the most
fundamental aspect of dialogue, that is, interpreting a
given question within the context of a specific dialogue.
It measures context processing abilities of systems such
as anaphora resolution and ellipses handling.
This paper is organized as follows. The next chap-
ter explains the design of QACIAD. The following three
chapters discuss the reality of the challenge. First, we ex-
plain the process of constructing the test set of the chal-
lenge and introduce the results of a study conducted dur-
ing this process which show the validity of QACIAD.
That is, QACIAD measures valid abilities needed for
participating in information access dialogues. In other
words, the ability measured by the challenge is crucial
to the systems for realizing information access dialogues
for writing reports and summaries. Second, we show the
statistics of pragmatic phenomena in the constructed test
set, and demonstrate that the challenge covers a wide va-
riety of pragmatic phenomena observed in real dialogues.
Third, based on a preliminary analysis of the QACIAD
run, we show that the challenge has a proper difficulty
for evaluating the current state of open-domain question
answering technologies. In the last two chapters, we dis-
cuss problems identified while constructing the test set
and conducting the run, and draw some conclusions.

2 Design of QACIAD
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.867825">
2.1 History
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999072">
The origin of QACIAD comes from QAC1 (Question
Answering Challenge), one of the tasks of the NTCIR3
workshop conducted from March 2001 through October
2002 (NTCIR, 2001). QACIAD was originally proposed
in March 2001 as the third subtask of QAC1, its formal
run was conducted in May 2002 (Fukumoto et al., 2001;
Fukumoto et al., 2002; Fukumoto et al., 2003), and the re-
sults were reported at the NTCIR3 workshop meeting in
October 2002. The current design of QACIAD reported
in this paper is based on that challenge and is the result
of extensive elaboration. The design of the challenge and
construction of the test set were performed from January
2003 through December 2003. The formal run was con-
ducted in December 2003, as a subtask of QAC2, which
in turn is a task of the NTCIR4 workshop (NTCIR, 2003).

2.2 QAC as a common ground
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855972222222">
QAC is a challenge for evaluating question answering
technologies in Japanese. It consists of three subtasks
including QACIAD, and the common scope of those sub-
tasks covers factoid questions that have names as an-
swers. Here, names mean not only names of proper items
(named entities) including date expressions and monetary
values, but also common names such as names of species
and names of body parts. Although the syntactical range
of the names approximately corresponds to compound
nouns, some of them, such as the titles of novels and
movies, deviate from that range. The underlying docu-
ment set consists of two years of articles of two newspa-
pers in QAC2, and one newspaper in QAC1. Using those
documents as the data source, the systems answer various
open-domain questions.
From the outset, QAC has focused on question answer-
ing technologies that can be used as components of larger
intelligent systems and technologies that can handle re-
alistic problems. It persists in requesting exact answers
rather than the text snippets that contain them with the
cost of avoiding handling definition questions and why
questions, because such answers are crucial in order to be
used as inputs to other intelligent systems such as multi-
document summarization systems. Moreover, as such a
situation is considered to be more realistic, the systems
must collect all the possible correct answers and detect
the absence of an answer. Therefore two subtasks, one of
which is QACIAD, request systems to return one list of
answers that contains all and only correct answers, while
the other subtask requests systems to return a ranked list
of possible answers as in TREC-8. In both subtasks, the
presence of answers in the underlying documents is not
guaranteed and the number of answers is not specified, so
these subtasks are similar to the list question task in the
TREC-2003 style rather than the TREC-10 style (TREC,
2003).

2.3 Information access dialogue
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996794210526316">
Considering scenes in which those question answering
systems participate in a dialogue, we classified informa-
tion access dialogues into the following two categories.
As discussed later, dialogues in a real situation may have
different features in their different portions; the classifi-
cation just shows two extremes.
Gathering Type The user has a concrete objective such
as writing a report and summary on a specific topic,
and asks a system a series of questions all concern-
ing that topic. The dialogue has a common global
topic, and, as a result, each consecutive question
shares a local context.
Browsing Type The user does not have any fixed topic
of interest; the topic of interest varies as the dialogue
progresses. No global topic covers a whole dialogue
but each consecutive question shares a local context.
This paper proposes the design of the challenge, which
can measure the abilities of question answering systems
useful in such dialogues.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974574">
2.4 The setting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986620689655">
QACIAD requests participant systems to return all pos-
sible answers to a series of questions, each of which is a
factoid question that has names as answer. This series of
questions and the answers to those questions comprise an
information access dialogue. Two examples of the series
of questions are shown in Figure 1, which were picked
up from our test set discussed in the next chapter. Se-
ries 14 is a series of a typical gathering type, while series
22 of a typical browsing type. In QACIAD, a number of
series (in the case of our test set, 36 series) are given to
the system at once and systems are requested to answer
those series in a batch mode. One series consists of seven
questions on average. The systems must identify the type
to which a series belongs, as it is not given. The systems
need not identify the changes of series, as the boundary
of series is given. Those, however, must not look ahead
to the questions following the one currently being han-
dled. This restriction reflects the fact that QACIAD is a
simulation of interactive use of question answering sys-
tems in dialogues. This restriction, accompanied with the
existence of two types of series, increases the complexity
of the context processing that the systems must employ.
For example, the systems need to identify that series 22
is a browsing type and the focus of the second question is
Yankee stadium rather than New York Yankees without
looking ahead to the following questions. Especially in
Japanese, since anaphora are not realized often and the
definite and indefinite are not clearly distinguished, those
problems are more serious.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988217">
2.5 Evaluation measure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992888888889">
In QACIAD, as the systems are requested to return one
list consisting all and only correct answers and the num-
ber of correct answers differs for each question1, mod-
ified F measure is used for the evaluation, which takes
account of both precision and recall. Two modifications
were needed. The first is for the case where an answer
list returned by a system contains the same answer more
than once or answers in different expressions denoting
the same item. In that case, only one answer is regarded
as the correct one, and so the precision of such answer
list decreases. Cases regarded as different expressions
denoting the same item include a person’s name with and
without the position name, variations of foreign name no-
tation, differences of monetary units used, differences of
time zone referred to, and so on. The second modifica-
tion is for questions with no answer. For those questions,
modified F measure is 1.0 if a system returns an empty
list as the answer, and is 0.0 otherwise.

The judgment as to whether a given answer is correct
or not takes into account not only an answer itself but
also the accompanying article from which the answer was
extracted. When the article does not validly support the
answer, that is, assessors cannot understand that the an-
swer is the correct one for a given question by reading
that article, it is regarded as incorrect even though the
answer itself is correct. The correctness of an answer
is determined according to the interpretation of a given
question done by human assessors within the given con-
text. The system’s answers to previous questions, and its
understanding of the context from which those answers
were derived, are irrelevant. For example, the correct an-
swer to the second question of series 22, namely when the
Yankee stadium was built, is 1923. If the system wrongly
answers the Shea stadium to the first question, and then
“correctly” answers the second question 1964, the year
when the Shea stadium was built, that answer to the sec-
ond question is not correct. On the other hand, if the
system answers 1923 to the second question with an ap-
propriate article supporting it, that answer is correct no
matter how the system answered the first question.

3 Constructing a Test Set and Usefulness
of the Challenge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999865">
We collected and analyzed questions for two purposes.
The first purpose was to establish a methodology for con-
structing a test set based on the design of QACIAD dis-
cussed in the previous chapter. The second purpose was
to confirm the reality of the challenge, that is, to deter-
mine whether it is useful for information access dialogues
to use question answering systems that can answer ques-
tions that have names as answers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999496">
3.1 Collecting questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923333333333">
Questions were collected as follows. Subjects were pre-
sented various topics, which included persons, organiza-
tions, and events selected from newspaper articles, and
were requested to make questions that ask for informa-
tion to be used in the report on that topic. The report is
supposed to describe facts on a given topic, rather than
contain opinions or prospects on the topic. The ques-
tions are restricted to wh-type questions, and natural se-
ries of questions containing anaphoric expressions and so
on were constructed. The topics were presented in three
different ways: only by a short description of the topic,
which corresponds to the title part of the TREC topic def-
inition; with a short article or the lead of a longer article,
which is representative of that topic and corresponds to
the narrative part of the TREC topic definition; and with
five articles concerning that topic. The number of top-
ics was 60, selected from two years of newspaper arti-
cles. Thirty subjects participated in the experiment. Each
subject made questions for ten topics for each topic pre-
sentation pattern, and was instructed to make around ten
questions for each topic. It is worth noting that the ques-
tions obtained were natural in both content and expres-
sion since in this experiment the subjects did not consider
whether the answers to their questions would be found in
the newspapers, and some subjects did not read the arti-
cles at all.
This time, for the test set construction and preliminary
analysis, 1,033 questions on 40 topics, made by three sub-
jects for each topic with different topic presentation pat-
terns, were used. All of the questions collected are now
being analyzed extensively, especially on the differences
among questions according to the topic presentation pat-
tern.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99994">
3.2 Analysis of the questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991876692307692">
Our main concern here is how many of the questions
collected fall into the category of questions that the cur-
rent question answering systems could answer. In other
words, how many of the questions can be answered by a
list of names? In the case the majority of them fall into
such a category, it is realistic to use question answering
systems for information access dialogues and the chal-
lenge on such abilities must be useful.
Table 1 shows the classification of questions according
to the subject asked. In the case where users ask ques-
tions to get information for a report, the number of why
questions is relatively small. Moreover, there were fewer
questions requesting an explanation or definition than ex-

pected, probably because questions such as “Who is Seiji
Ozawa” were decomposed into relatively concrete ques-
tions such as those asking for his birthday and birth place.
However, not all questions that were categorized as
4W questions could be answered by names. For exam-
ple, whereas questions asking where, such as “Where was
Shakespeare born?”, could be answered by a place name,
questions like “Where do lobsters like to live?” need a
description and not a proper name as the answer. Table 2
shows the result of categorization according to this as-
pect. This categorization was conducted by inspecting
questions only, and some of the questions were hard to
determine decisively whether those could be answered
by names or not, and so were categorized as “Names
probably”. For example, the question “Where does the
name ‘AIBO’ come from?” could be answered by name
if AIBO is an acronym, but there may be a long story as
to its origin. Although such cases happened in other com-
binations of categories, those questions were categorized
into a more complex category as only the border of names
and descriptions are important in the current analysis.
As Table 2 shows, 58% to 72% of questions could be
answered by names. The amount of those questions is al-
most same as the amount of 4W questions, since while
some 4W questions could not be answered by names,
some definition and explanation questions might be able
to be answered by names. The fact that 58% to 72% of
questions for writing reports could be answered by names
demonstrates that question answering systems that an-
swer these questions are useful in such situations.
In addition, the answers to 84% of those 72% questions
could be found by humans from newspaper articles. This
indicates that the setting is realistic where users write re-
ports through interacting with a question answering sys-
tem that uses newspaper articles as its data source.

3.3 Constructing a test set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992724137931">
Using the questions collected, we constructed a test set
as follows. We selected 26 from 40 topics, and chose
appropriate questions and rearranged them for construct-
ing gathering type series. Some of the questions were
edited in order to resolve semantic or pragmatic ambigui-
ties, though we tried to use the questions without modifi-
cation where possible. The topics of the gathering series
consisted of 5 persons, 2 organizations, 11 events, 5 ar-
tifacts, and 3 animals and fishes, among which 4 topics
concerned sets of organizations and events, such as the
big three companies in the beer industry, simultaneous
terrorist attacks, and annual festival events.
Browsing type series were constructed by using some
of the remaining questions as seeds of a sequence and by
adding new questions to create a flow to/from those ques-
tions. For example, series 22 shown in Figure 1 was com-
posed by adding the last four newly created questions to
the first four questions which were collected for the Yan-
kee stadium2. For such seeds, we also used the collection
of questions for evaluating summarization constructed for
TSC (Text Summarization Challenge), another challenge
in the NTCIR workshop (TSC, 2003). Some topics used
for the question collection were the same as the topics
used in TSC also. We made 10 browsing series in this
way.
Finally, the test set constructed this time contained 36
series and 251 questions, with 26 series of the gather-
ing type and 10 series of the browsing type. The average
number of questions in one series was 6.92.

4 Characteristics of the Test Set
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99919675">
This chapter describes the pragmatic characteristics of
the constructed test set. Japanese has four major types
of anaphoric devices: pronouns, zero pronouns, definite
noun phrases, and ellipses. Zero pronouns are very com-
mon in Japanese in which pronouns are not realized on
the surface. As Japanese also has a completely different
determiner system from English, the difference between
definite and indefinite is not apparent on the surface,
and definite noun phrases usually have the same form
as generic noun phrases. Table 3 shows the summary
of such pragmatic phenomena observed in 215 questions
obtained by removing the first one of each series from
the 251 questions in the test set. The total number is
more than 215 as 12 questions contain more than one phe-
nomenon. The sixth question in series 22, “Who was the
bride at that time?” is an example of such a question with

multiple anaphoric expressions. The numbers in paren-
theses show the number of cases in which the referenced
item is an event. As the table indicates, a wide range of
pragmatic phenomena is observed in the test set.
Precisely speaking, the series in the test set can be
characterized through the pragmatic phenomena that they
contain. Gathering type series consist of questions that
have a common referent in a broad sense, which is a
global topic mentioned in the first question of the series.
Strictly gathering type series can be distinguished as a
special case of gathering type series. In those series, all
questions refer exactly to the same item mentioned in the
first question and do not have any other anaphoric ex-
pression. In other words, questions about the common
topic introduced by the first question comprise a whole
sequence. Series 14 in Figure 1 is an example of the
strictly gathering type and all questions can be interpreted
by supplying Seiji Ozawa, who is introduced in the first
question. The test set has 5 series of the strictly gathering
type. Other gathering type series have other two types of
questions. The first type of questions not only has a ref-
erence to the global topic but also refers to other items or
has an ellipsis. The second type of questions has a refer-
ence to a complex item, such as an event that contains the
global topic as its component. Series 20 shown in Fig-
ure 2 is such a series. The third question refers not only
to the global topic, George Mallory, in this case, but also
to his famous phrase. The sixth one refers to an event
George Mallory was concerned in.
On the other hand, the questions of a browsing type
series do not have such a global topic. Sometimes the
referent is the answer of the immediately preceding ques-
tion, such as the fifth, seventh and eighth questions in
series 22 in Figure 1. No series, however, consists solely
of questions that have only a reference to the answer to
the immediately previous questions. All series contain
references to the answers to non-immediately previous
questions or items mentioned in the previous questions,
or more than one pragmatic phenomenon. In series 22,
the third, fourth and sixth questions belong to such a case.
In both types, therefore, the shifting pattern of the fo-
cus is not simple, and so a sophisticated way is needed to
track it. Such focus tracking is indispensable to get cor-
rect answers. Systems cannot even retrieve articles con-

is clear for the browsing type, as an article is unlikely to
mention both the New York Yankees and Campbell soup.
In the gathering type, since the topics mentioned in rela-
tively many articles were chosen, it is not easy to locate
the answer to a question from those articles retrieved us-
ing that topic as the keyword. For example, there are 155
articles mentioning Seiji Ozawa in our document sets, of
which 22 articles mention his move to the Vienna Phil-
harmonic Orchestra, and only two articles also mention
his birthday. An extensive, quantitative analysis is now
in progress.

Seven teams and fourteen systems participated in the run
using the test set mentioned in the previous chapter con-
ducted in December 2003. In this chapter, based on a
preliminary analysis of the run, the difficulty of the chal-
lenge and the current state of technologies for addressing

the first question of each series. This indicates that more
sophisticated context processing is needed.
The mean modified F measure is not high even for the
top systems. This is probably because of not only the
difficulties of context processing but also the difficulties
of returning the list of all and only correct answers. It
is difficult to achieve high recall since some of the ques-

tions have many correct answers, such as asking for all of
the countries and regions which participated in the 1998
football world cup held in France. The modified F mea-
sure is only 0.33 if a system returns a list of five items
including the only correct answer, as the precision is 0.2
in that case. In order to remove the effects of such dif-
ficulties on answering lists approximately, the number of
questions to which the system gives at least one of the
correct answers was calculated. The result is shown in
Figure 4. The rank of the systems somewhat changes by
this approximation, as some systems benefit from this ap-
proximation and others do not. Based on this criterion,
the best system answered correctly 45% of the questions,
which is inadequate for practical use. However, the result
shows that this challenge is not too hard and desperate,
though it is challenging for existing question answering
technologies.
The mean modified F measures for the strictly gath-
ering type, other gathering type, and browsing type are
shown in Figure 5. For the majority, the questions in the
browsing type series are more difficult to answer, as an-
ticipated.

With existing technologies, which still have room for
study for answering ordinary questions without prag-
matic processing and particularly remain inadequate for
answering list questions correctly, QACIAD cannot eas-
ily independently evaluate the context processing abilities
from other general abilities concerning question answer-
ing. The ability that QACIAD measures is a combina-
tion of several kinds of abilities concerning question an-
swering for handling information access dialogues. Al-
though this may be desirable and an objective of QA-
CIAD, sometime we need an isolated evaluation of con-
text processing. In order to fulfill this need, we devised
two types of accompanying test sets for reference. The
first reference test set consists of isolated questions, that
is, not in series, obtained from questions of the original
test set by manually resolving all anaphoric expressions
including zero anaphora. The second reference test set
consists of isolated questions obtained from questions of
the original test set by mechanically removing anaphoric
expressions. Though most of the questions in the second
test set are semantically under-specified, such as asking a
birthday without specifying whose one, all the questions
are syntactically well formed in the case of Japanese. The
first reference test set measures the ceiling of the context
processing in a given original test set, while the second
measures the floor. These are only for reference, since
there are several ways of resolving anaphora and con-
text processing sometimes makes thing worse. Neverthe-
less, the reference test sets should be useful for analyzing
the characteristics of technologies used by the participant
systems. We are now analyzing the results of the run on
those reference test sets for our current test set, and will
present the results in due course.
As described above, we believe that the task setting in
QACIAD is real, even though this is not clear from the
evaluation method. There are two major problems. The
first concerns the F measure. First, the F measure can-
not be calculated until the number of correct answers is
fixed, which means the value of the F measure changes
when a new correct answer is found. This makes the
evaluation cumbersome. Especially in question answer-
ing, as the number of correct answers is usually relatively
small, the recall rate sometimes falls to half if a minor
alternative answer is found to a question that had been
assumed to have only one correct answer. Even worse,
some questions have more than one way of enumerating
correct answers. For example, to a question asking for the
sites of a ski jump competition, a system may answer six
city names, and another system may answer three coun-
try names. Neither are wrong. A system could even an-
swer four city names and one country name. We need
a principle for handling such cases. In TREC-2003 this
problem were cleverly avoided by carefully checking the
question3.
The second and more serious problem comes from
handling dialogues. As mentioned above, whether an an-
swer is correct or not is determined by human interpre-
tation of a given question within the given context and
is not affected by a system’s interpretation and the an-
swers it returned to the previous questions. Many feel that
this evaluation criterion is somewhat peculiar. As men-
tioned in the example in chapter 2.5, in series 22, the an-
swer to the second question, 1923, is considered correct
even if the system wrongly answered the Shea stadium
to the first question. This is not completely absurd be-
cause that system may manage the context intensionally,
in which case the system may interpret the second ques-
tion as “When was the home to the New York Yankees
built?” It is doubtful, however, whether such a “correct”
answer has any value in practice. This problem shows the
importance of cooperative response. It may be effective
to change the style of answering from a current list of
answers to answers with additional information. In this
example, it would be better to answer “The Yankee sta-
dium was built in 1923”, and the correctness of answers
should be judged by including this additional informa-
tion. The difficult and remaining problem is to formalize
this type of cooperative response to a sufficient level for
use in objective evaluations like QACIAD.

abilities measured by this challenge are expected to be
useful for making reports and summaries. The proposed
challenge has reasonable difficulties with existing tech-
nologies. Our proposal also has several important ideas,
including the distinction of series of questions into gath-
ering type and browsing type series, and the introduc-
tion of reference test sets for extracting and evaluating
the context processing abilities of the systems.

<abstract confidence="0.999657944444444">A novel challenge for evaluating open-domain question answering technologies is proposed. In this challenge, question answering systems are supposed to be used interactively to answer a series of related questions, whereas in the conventional setting, systems answer isolated questions one by one. Such an interaction occurs in the case of gathering information for a report on a specific topic, or when browsing information of interest to the user. In this paper, first, we explain the design of the challenge. We then discuss its reality and show how the capabilities measured by the challenge are useful and important in practical situations, and that the difficulty of the challenge is proper for evaluating the current state of open-domain question answering technologies.</abstract>

On some stage of that sophistication, a cub reporter writing an article on a specific topic will be able to translate the main issue addressed by his report into a set of simpler questions and then pose those questions to the question answering system (Burger et al., 2001). In addition, there is a relation between multi-document summarization and question answering. In his lecture, Eduard Hovy mentioned that multi-document summarization may be able to be reduced into a series of question answering (Hovy, 2001). In SUMMAC, an intrinsic evaluation was conducted which measures the extent to which a summary provides answers to a set of obligatory questions on a given topic (Mani et al., 1998). Those suggest such question answering systems that can answer a series of related questions would surely be a useful aid to summarization work by human and by machine. Against this background, question answering systems need to be able to answer a series of questions, which have a common topic and/or share a local context.
