<bodyText confidence="0.994361157894737">
The adoption of semantic Query Expansion
(QE) could be useful in the context of Ques-
tion/Answering (Q/A) systems. For the Arabic
language this is a challenging task since it has
many particularities (short vowels, absence of
capital letters, complex morphology, etc.).
This paper presents an evaluation of a pro-
posed semantic QE based on Arabic WordNet
(AWN). Two types of experiments are con-
ducted: the keyword-based evaluation which
uses a classical search engine as passage re-
trieval system, and the structure-based evalua-
tion that uses the Java Information Retrieval
System (JIRS) which takes into account the
structure of the question. Results show that the
best performances in terms of accuracy and
Mean Reciprocal Rank are reached when the
proposed semantic QE together with JIRS are
used.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968698113208">
With the fast growing of the available content on
the web, there is an increasing interest in Ques-
tion/Answering systems (Q/A) (Carbonell et al.,
2000). In fact, classical Information Retrieval
(IR) systems are wasteful when users look for a
precise answer of a question instead of a set of
returned documents.
Unlike other languages such as English, the re-
search in Arabic Natural Language Processing
(NLP) has, so far, concentrated less on the Q/A
task. Nevertheless, there are a number of at-
tempts to implement automatic Arabic Q/A sys-
tems working on structured texts (Mohammed et
al., 1993), returning relevant snippets without
automatically extracting answers (Hammou et
al., 2002), (Benajiba et al., 2007a) as well as re-
cently a semi-automatic Q/A system for factoid
questions (Brini et al., to appear in 2009). Most
of these systems are based on three modules:
question classification and analysis, passage re-
trieval (PR) and answer extraction. The perform-
ance of the latter depends on the results provided
by the two first modules. Indeed, if the retrieved
passages returned by the second module do not
contain the whole or a part of the question key-
words, the answer extraction module fails to pro-
vide the expected answer.
Most of the time, users concretely formulate the
question using words which do not, necessarily,
appear in the base documents. Therefore, a
Query Expansion (QE) process could be used by
the Q/A system modules in order to generate new
keywords that may exist in the base documents.
Rachidi et al. (2003) cite statistical and diction-
ary-based QE techniques as the most common
for Arabic. These techniques could be useful in
the context of Q/A systems. Unfortunately, key-
words which are semantically related to the user
question may not be provided by a basic QE.
Indeed, even if those keywords could be rele-
vant, a QE which uses only lexical and morpho-
logical resources might not be able to identify
them. Thus, the use of a semantic QE is required
since the same question can be formulated using
different words with an equivalent meaning.
Moreover, the generation of keywords based on
the semantic relations makes easier the matching
of the question structure and the candidate pas-
sages one.
In (Abouenour et al., 2008) we have presented a
semantic QE approach with preliminary experi-
ments in the context of the Arabic Q/A task. This
approach uses the current release of the Arabic

WordNet1 ontology (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006;
Rodriguez et al., 2008). Let us recall briefly that
AWN ontology is a free lexical resource for
modern standard Arabic (Elkateb et al., 2006). It
is based on the design and contents of Princeton
WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 2000) and can be
mapped onto PWN as well as a number of other
wordnets, enabling translation on the lexical
level to and from dozens of other languages.
AWN is also connected to SUMO (Supper Upper
Merged Ontology) (Niles and Pease, 2001; Niles
and Pease, 2003).
Our approach uses not only the current content of
AWN but also four of its semantic relations. In-
deed, we use a QE process based on: (i) QE by
synonyms, (ii) QE by definitions, (iii) QE by
subtypes, (iv) QE by supertypes.
In order to be able, in further works, to consider
other semantic operations, we have implemented
our approach using the Amine Platform2. Amine
is a Java open source multi-layer platform dedi-
cated to the development of intelligent systems
and multi-agents systems (Kabbaj et al., 2006).
Thus, the Amine AWN (AAWN) hierarchy is
based on the content and the structure of AWN.
For each concept type in AAWN there are syno-
nyms, subtypes and supertypes with respect to
the synonymy, hyponymy and hypernymy rela-
tions in AWN. The implementation of QE by
definition uses the SUMO concepts definitions
written in SUO-KIF notation.
The added value of this semantic QE in the con-
text of Arabic Q/A systems has been illustrated
by examples in (Abouenour et al., 2008). We
have conducted preliminary experiments with 82
CLEF3 questions with manual search using
Google Search Engine (SE).
In the community and in order to evaluate the
results, two measures are considered:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999732714285714">
• The Accuracy which is the average of the
questions where we find the right answer in
the first snippet;
• The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The

multiplicative inverse of the rank of the

<bodyText confidence="0.977675909090909">
reciprocal ranks of results for a sample of
queries4 (Voorhees, 1999).
The results have shown that the semantic QE
based on AAWN ontology has improved the ac-
curacy by 3,66 % and the MRR by 1,10. Prelimi-
nary experiments consider keywords separately
without taking into account the question struc-
ture. The Java Information Retrieval System
(JIRS5) (Benajiba et al., 2007b) is a passage re-
trieval system which can allow us to consider
this structure.
Our general aim is to develop a separate seman-
tic QE module that could be used within Q/A
systems. In the context of the current paper, our
objective is two fold: (i) confirm previous results
with large and automatic experiments using the
Yahoo API; (ii) take into account the structure of
the question and retrieved passages using JIRS.
The structure of this paper is as follows: in Sec-
tion 2 we give more details about the evaluation
and the refinement process of our semantic
Query Expansion. Section 3 is devoted to the
results of the automatic evaluation based only on
keywords. In Section 4, we present the results of
the structure-based evaluation. Section 5 is a syn-
thesis of the results reached in the two experi-
ments. Finally, in the last section we draw some
conclusions and we discuss the future works to
be done.

model and the semantic resource used. With re-
spect to the semantic resource level, the current
release of AWN (Elkateb et al., 2006) allows to
work with around 20,000 words grouped into
10,000 synsets.
At the experiments level, the current evaluation
process uses a set of 82 CLEF questions that was
translated into Arabic6. These CLEF questions
are classified into different domains (sport, geog-
raphy, politic, etc.) and different types (questions
seeking for time answers, persons, places, etc.)
as illustrated in Table 1. The considered ques-
tions are related to different topics and, therefore,
present a significant coverage.

Actually, we did not use any specific Q/A sys-
tem. However, in order to simulate the use of our
QE module within Q/A systems, we carried out
the following experiment process: we manually
select the most relevant keywords of each ques-
tion. The given keywords are, then, extended
using our semantic Query Expansion process.
After that, the answer of each question and ex-
tended question is searched within the first five
snippets returned by the used Passage Retrieval
(PR) system. In the keyword-based evaluation
process only a search engine (Yahoo7) is used as
PR system (the returned snippets are considered
in the evaluation).
In the structure-based evaluation process, JIRS is
used. Indeed, JIRS is a language-independent PR
system which has been already adapted to a few
non-agglutinative European languages (such as
English and French) as well as to the Arabic lan-
guage (Benajiba et al., 2007b). The re-ranking of
the retrieved passages is based on a distance den-
sity n-gram model. In (Benajiba et al., 2007b)
authors explain the idea of this model which

gives more weight to the passages where the
most relevant question structures appear nearer
to each other. In (Gomez et al., 2007) some ex-
periments were carried out to re-rank snippets
obtained with Yahoo in order to return the most
relevant ones containing the answer.
In the next section we present the results ob-
tained with an automatic evaluation process us-
ing the Yahoo search engine.

Table 2 shows the results of the experiments us-
ing the Yahoo API. The poor performance ob-
tained is due to the fact that some relaxations are
not used when we perform an automatic process.
For example, in the manual process we can iden-
tify answers composed of more than one word.
For example, the answer of the question &amp;quot;+ ���
4&amp;quot;tSSll uy;�l� s-A�J Z�.,wl Z.11&apos; (What is the value of
the Moroccan book award?) is &amp;quot;7000 1112&apos;. If a
snippet contains for instance the expression &amp;quot; Z���
���� � �� &apos;the answer is considered correct.
Nevertheless, even with an automatic process,
the use of AAWN Query Expansion has im-
proved the accuracy (from 1,22% to 7,32%) and
the MRR (from 0,99 to 3,25). Moreover, the use
of only one type of semantic QE already im-
proves of the considered measures. For instance,
the QE by synonym reaches an accuracy of 3,66
% (against 1,22% without QE) and 1,63 as MRR
(against 0,99 without QE).
We can also notice that among the four semantic
types of QE the one by supertypes gives the best
results in term of accuracy and MRR as well.
The ranking of the four semantic types of QE is
the same with respect to the accuracy measure or
the MRR.

In the previous section we have considered only
the first five snippets. However, the expected
answer could exist in the returned results but not
in these first five snippets. As we already men-
tioned, Gomez et al. (2007) have carried out pre-
liminary experiments that show how JIRS PR
system helps to re-rank Yahoo search engine
snippets in order to make easier the answer ex-
traction. Indeed, they have showed that the dis-
tance density n-gram model of JIRS improves
both the coverage and the redundancy of the an-
swers.
In these experiments, we have built a corpus
based on the first 1,000 returned snippets by Ya-
hoo. For the 82 CLEF questions, we have ob-
tained an average of 42.96 returned snippets per
question. After applying the JIRS indexation
process to the built corpus, we have carried out
the same experiments of the previous section, but
using the JIRS PR system instead of the Yahoo

6 Conclusion and Future Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947190476191">
This work has been done in order to evaluate our
proposed semantic QE for Arabic Q/A systems.
Our aim was to confirm the preliminary experi-
ments which showed that the accuracy and the
MRR have been improved and that our semantic
QE process (based on the current release of
AWN) is adequate to improve the passage re-
trieval stage of an Arabic Q/A system.
This work has confirmed that, once more, the
semantic QE improves both the accuracy and the
MRR. In addition, in the case where it is com-
bined with JIRS, our approach has obtained an
accuracy around 19,51% and 7,85 as MRR. This
means that when we take into account the seman-
tic and the structure of the question we improve
the probability of obtaining relevant passages
(i.e., containing the answer).
The use of Arabic WordNet within the Amine
Platform traces new ways regarding the semantic
QE. As future work, we could take advantage of
the concept definitions. Indeed, we could calcu-

late the similarity between the question and the
returned passages according to a semantic com-
parison.
The proposed semantic QE approach does not
define, so far, any weight to be assigned to the
generated keywords. In the next steps of this
work, we could decide on the relevance of each
keyword according to its source (e.g. QE by su-
pertypes could have the higher value) and the
distance between the generated keyword and the
initial one.
Finally, at the moment, the AWN project does
not cover totally the standard Arabic. Therefore,
the consideration of a completed version of
AWN (Rodriguez et al., 2008) is to be intended.

<abstract confidence="0.99679">The adoption of semantic Query Expansion (QE) could be useful in the context of Question/Answering (Q/A) systems. For the Arabic language this is a challenging task since it has many particularities (short vowels, absence of capital letters, complex morphology, etc.). This paper presents an evaluation of a proposed semantic QE based on Arabic WordNet (AWN). Two types of experiments are conducted: the keyword-based evaluation which uses a classical search engine as passage retrieval system, and the structure-based evaluation that uses the Java Information Retrieval System (JIRS) which takes into account the structure of the question. Results show that the best performances in terms of accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank are reached when the proposed semantic QE together with JIRS are used.</abstract>

Unfortunately, keywords which are semantically related to the user question may not be provided by a basic QE. Indeed, even if those keywords could be relevant, a QE which uses only lexical and morphological resources might not be able to identify them. Thus, the use of a semantic QE is required since the same question can be formulated using different words with an equivalent meaning. Moreover, the generation of keywords based on the semantic relations makes easier the matching of the question structure and the candidate passages one. In (Abouenour et al., 2008) we have presented a semantic QE approach with preliminary experiments in the context of the Arabic Q/A task. This approach uses the current release of the Arabic Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages, pages 62–68, Athens, Greece, 31 March, 2009. c�2009 Association for Computational Linguistics 62 WordNet1 ontology (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006; Rodriguez et al., 2008). Let us recall briefly that AWN ontology is a free lexical resource for modern standard Arabic (Elkateb et al., 2006). It is based on the design and contents of Princeton WordNet (P</context>

Amine is a Java open source multi-layer platform dedicated to the development of intelligent systems and multi-agents systems (Kabbaj et al., 2006). Thus, the Amine AWN (AAWN) hierarchy is based on the content and the structure of AWN. For each concept type in AAWN there are synonyms, subtypes and supertypes with respect to the synonymy, hyponymy and hypernymy relations in AWN. The implementation of QE by definition uses the SUMO concepts definitions written in SUO-KIF notation. The added value of this semantic QE in the context of Arabic Q/A systems has been illustrated by examples in (Abouenour et al., 2008). We have conducted preliminary experiments with 82 CLEF3 questions with manual search using Google Search Engine (SE). In the community and in order to evaluate the results, two measures are considered: • The Accuracy which is the average of the questions where we find the right answer in the first snippet; • The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The reciprocal rank of a query response is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the correct answer: MRR is the average of the 1 http://www.globalwordnet.org/AWN/ 2 http://amine-platform.sourceforge.net 3 Cross Language Evaluation Forum, http://www.cle</context>

In fact, classical Information Retrieval (IR) systems are wasteful when users look for a precise answer of a question instead of a set of returned documents. Unlike other languages such as English, the research in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) has, so far, concentrated less on the Q/A task. Nevertheless, there are a number of attempts to implement automatic Arabic Q/A systems working on structured texts (Mohammed et al., 1993), returning relevant snippets without automatically extracting answers (Hammou et al., 2002), (Benajiba et al., 2007a) as well as recently a semi-automatic Q/A system for factoid questions (Brini et al., to appear in 2009). Most of these systems are based on three modules: question classification and analysis, passage retrieval (PR) and answer extraction. The performance of the latter depends on the results provided by the two first modules. Indeed, if the retrieved passages returned by the second module do not contain the whole or a part of the question keywords, the answer extraction module fails to provide the expected answer. Most of the time, users concretely formulate the question using words which do</context>

The results have shown that the semantic QE based on AAWN ontology has improved the accuracy by 3,66 % and the MRR by 1,10. Preliminary experiments consider keywords separately without taking into account the question structure. The Java Information Retrieval System (JIRS5) (Benajiba et al., 2007b) is a passage retrieval system which can allow us to consider this structure. Our general aim is to develop a separate semantic QE module that could be used within Q/A systems. In the context of the current paper, our objective is two fold: (i) confirm previous results with large and automatic experiments using the Yahoo API; (ii) take into account the structure of the question and retrieved passages using JIRS. The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we give more details about the evaluation and the refinement process of our semantic Query Expansion. Section 3 is devoted to </context>

After that, the answer of each question and extended question is searched within the first five snippets returned by the used Passage Retrieval (PR) system. In the keyword-based evaluation process only a search engine (Yahoo7) is used as PR system (the returned snippets are considered in the evaluation). In the structure-based evaluation process, JIRS is used. Indeed, JIRS is a language-independent PR system which has been already adapted to a few non-agglutinative European languages (such as English and French) as well as to the Arabic language (Benajiba et al., 2007b). The re-ranking of the retrieved passages is based on a distance density n-gram model. In (Benajiba et al., 2007b) authors explain the idea of this model which 6 http://www.dsic.upv.es/grupos/nle/downloads.html 7 www.yahoo.com gives more weight to the passages where the most relevant question structures appear nearer to each other.

With respect to the semantic resource level, the current release of AWN (Elkateb et al., 2006) allows to work with around 20,000 words grouped into 10,000 synsets. At the experiments level, the current evaluation process uses a set of 82 CLEF questions that was translated into Arabic6. These CLEF questions are classified into different domains (sport, geography, politic, etc.) and different types (questions seeking for time answers, persons, places, etc.) as illustrated in Table 1. The considered questions are related to different topics and, therefore, present a significant coverage.

For each concept type in AAWN there are synonyms, subtypes and supertypes with respect to the synonymy, hyponymy and hypernymy relations in AWN. The implementation of QE by definition uses the SUMO concepts definitions written in SUO-KIF notation. The added value of this semantic QE in the context of Arabic Q/A systems has been illustrated by examples in (Abouenour et al., 2008).

In fact, classical Information Retrieval (IR) systems are wasteful when users look for a precise answer of a question instead of a set of returned documents. Unlike other languages such as English, the research in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) has, so far, concentrated less on the Q/A task. Nevertheless, there are a number of attempts to implement automatic Arabic Q/A systems working on structured texts (Mohammed et al., 1993), returning relevant snippets without automatically extracting answers (Hammou et al., 2002), (Benajiba et al., 2007a) as well as recently a semi-automatic Q/A system for factoid questions (Brini et al., to appear in 2009). Most of these systems are based on three modules: question classification and analysis, passage retrieval (PR) and answer extraction. The performance of the latter depends on the results provided by the two first modules. Indeed, if the retrieved passages returned by the second module do not contain the whole or a part of the question keywords, the answer extraction module </context>

The performance of the latter depends on the results provided by the two first modules. Indeed, if the retrieved passages returned by the second module do not contain the whole or a part of the question keywords, the answer extraction module fails to provide the expected answer. Most of the time, users concretely formulate the question using words which do not, necessarily, appear in the base documents. Therefore, a Query Expansion (QE) process could be used by the Q/A system modules in order to generate new keywords that may exist in the base documents. Rachidi et al. (2003) cite statistical and dictionary-based QE techniques as the most common for Arabic. These techniques could be useful in the context of Q/A systems. Unfortunately, keywords which are semantically related to the user question may not be provided by a basic QE. Indeed, even if those keywords could be relevant, a QE which uses only lexical and morphological resources might not be able to identify them. Thus, the use of a semantic QE is required since the same question can be formulated using different words with an equivalent meaning. Moreover, the generation of keywords based on the semantic rela</context>

In the community and in order to evaluate the results, two measures are considered: • The Accuracy which is the average of the questions where we find the right answer in the first snippet; • The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The reciprocal rank of a query response is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the correct answer: MRR is the average of the 1 http://www.globalwordnet.org/AWN/ 2 http://amine-platform.sourceforge.net 3 Cross Language Evaluation Forum, http://www.clefcampaign.org reciprocal ranks of results for a sample of queries4 (Voorhees, 1999). The results have shown that the semantic QE based on AAWN ontology has improved the accuracy by 3,66 % and the MRR by 1,10. Preliminary experiments consider keywords separately without taking into account the question structure. The Java Information Retrieval System (JIRS5) (Benajiba et al., 2007b) is a passage retrieval system which can allow us to consider this structure. Our general aim is to develop a separate semantic QE module that could be used within Q/A systems. In the context of the current paper, our objective is two fold: (i) confirm previous results with large and automatic expe</context>
