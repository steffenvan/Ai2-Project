My position paper addresses more or less Workshop question No. 5: &amp;quot;How are
rhetorical relations used in discourse understanding? How are linguistic clues and
world knowledge brought to bear?&amp;quot;
The paper shows how rhetorical relations could be used in Machine Translation
(MT). It introduces in brief, a discourse-oriented approach for MT which uses
schemata of rhetorical predicates for describing the structure of a paragraph. At the
same time, it poses at least two questions (in my opinion practically unsolved
problems):

1) How can rhetorical predicates be computationally recognized?
2) Are the so far defined predicates sufficient and precise enough to describe the

INTRODUCTION: DISCOURSE-ORIENTED MACHINE TRANSLATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913352941176">
The discourse-oriented MT should be regarded as a very important research topic,
since it is expected to make the translation more natural in MT systems.
Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to this problem yet and the
availability of a discourse component in a MT system has been reported very briefly
in [7] only.
Most of the MT systems perform sentence-by-sentence translation. Only a few try to
translate paragraph-by-paragraph and in these cases, the discourse structure of the
output language is identical with that of the input language. However, I have shown
that the discourse structures across the different sublanguages are not always the
same for any pair of natural languages [5].
Paragraph-by-paragraph machine translation seems to be for now, an unjustifiably
complicated task for practical needs. It involves the complete understanding of the
paragraph, the determination of discourse topic(s), goals, intentions, so that the
output can be produced in accordance with the respective discourse rules and
purposes. However, recognizing topic, goal, intention by a computer program seems
to be a very tough problem. Moreover, analyzing a paragraph is itself a complicated
task which does not always yield satisfactory results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
On the other hand, translating sentence-by-sentence with the sequence of the
original sentences preserved is a general approach, which guarantees in most of the
cases an understandable output. However, in order for a translated message to sound
as natural as possible, it should be conveyed in accordance with the discourse
organization rules of the target language. If we examine more closely the work of a
professional translator, we shall inevitably note that he/she does not always follow
the order of sentences in the source text.
Taking into account the complexity of paragraph understanding and the necessity of
observing the specific target sublanguage rules, I have been working on a practical
discourse-oriented MT approach (within an English to Malay MT system) which
analyzes a source paragraph as a schema of rhetorical predicates and generates the
target text possibly as another schema of rhetorical predicates. Towards this end, I
have developed a Text Organization Framework Grammar which maps source
paragraph structures of rhetorical predicates into the specific target paragraph
structures of rhetorical predicates [6].

SELECTION OF TEXT ORGANIZATION APPROACH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879">
I have been studying different approaches which have been so far used to describe
the organization of a given text (paragraph). From a practical point of view, I argue
that the most appropriate approach would be the &amp;quot;schemata-based approach&amp;quot;
introduced by K. McKeown [3] and used by other researchers.
Though some researchers point out the relatively missing flexibility of this
approach, I found this approach more suitable for the needs of MT. The plan-based
approach [4] seems to be too complicated and unrealistic to be implemented in an
MT system because its rhetorical relations are dependent on an expected effect on
the hearer achieved by their combination. In a MT system, as already mentioned, it
is very hard, if practically not possible, to recognize automatically in a paragraph the
goals and intentions of the speaker.

SUBLANGUAGES AND SCHEMATA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994196055555556">
In the sublanguages I studied, however, I found out that the schemata of rhetorical
predicates could not be always uniquely defined. There are sublanguages where
more than one typical schema should be defined and consequently used. I examined
numerous texts on which basis I defined &amp;quot;stable schemata&amp;quot;. The schemata Sl, S2, ..,
SN can be considered &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; if 1) SI/N?.8, VI and 2) ISI/Isray where N is the
number of all examined texts, 8, y are numbers in the interval (0,1) which we call
&amp;quot;individual contribution minimum&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;global contribution minimum&amp;quot;
respectively. The idea behind these mathematics is that schemata can be considered
as &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; if they as a whole represent a significant portion of all examined texts
and yet every &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; schema should be itself representative.
For translation from English into Malay, if more than one stable schema is available
in the respective sublanguage, the stable schema, which is closest to the input of
English text is chosen. For determining closeness, special metrics has been
developed which takes into account not only the number of displaced predicates,
but also the size of the displacement and the maximal length of matched substrings
from the input and output schemata of rhetorical predicates.
We have studied the discourse structure of a few sublanguages (for both English and
Malay), potential candidates for translation domains in our MT system: the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997637">
87
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99293925">
sublanguages of job vacancies, residential properties for sale, cars for sale and
education advertisements from different newspapers in English and Malay.
From our investigations on these sublanguages we have drawn three main
conclusions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.81697675">
1) The stable schemata for English and Malay are not always identical and do not
occur equally frequent
2) For some sublanguages there are more than one stable schema
3) For some sublanguages there exists no stable schema
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979316526315789">
These conclusions are important for MT because in the third case there is no need
for discourse transition rules and the translation should be undertaken sentence-by-
sentence.
THE BIG PROBLEM: IDENTIFICATION OF RHETORICAL PREDICATES
During the analysis, rhetorical predicates should be recognized. In certain
sublanguages this can be done by means of key words and other clues [5]. However,
in general this seems to be a very complicated problem and extensive world
knowledge and inferencing mechanisms are needed. How could a program
recognize a sentence (proposition) as amplification, attributive, etc. rhetorical
predicate? For our sublanguage-based MT needs, I am considering two approaches
for the identification of rhetorical predicates.
One approach would be to define &amp;quot;verb frameworks&amp;quot; characteristic of a verb within
the sublanguage. Each verb should be associated with possible rhetorical predicates
and the predicate should be identified on the basis of the logical structure of the
analysis. However, this approach may not be powerful enough in certain cases.
Consider the sample text from [2] describing Kyushu Daigalcu (Kyushu University):
&amp;quot;A national, coeducational university in the city of Fukuoka. Founded in 1910 as Kyushu
Imperial University. It maintains faculties of letters, education, law, economics, science,
medicine, dentistry, pharmacology, engineering, and agriculture. Research institutes include
the following: the Research Institute of Balneotherapeutics, the Research Institute of Applied
Mechanics, the Research Institute of Industry and labor, and the Research Institute of
Industrial Science. Enrollment was 9,425 in 1980&amp;quot;.
It will be quite difficult, however, using only verb framework, to recognize the first,
the third, fourth and the last sentence as rhetorical predicates. An useful approach in
this case would be to use a domain knowledge which would enable the recognition
of the rhetorical predicate after a semantic analysis. For instance a proposition
describing entities which are in &apos;sub-part&apos; relation should be classified as a
constituency predicate. This &apos;sub-part&apos; relation could be easily recognized, provided
it has been already described in the domain knowledge base. Consider again the
sample text under the assumption that such a knowledge base exists. In this case,
from the &apos;is-a&apos; relation (&amp;quot;Kyushu Daigaku&amp;quot;- &amp;quot;University&amp;quot;), from the respective &apos;sub-
part relations&apos; (&amp;quot;university&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;faculty&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;research centre&amp;quot;) and the &apos;has&apos; relation
(&amp;quot;university&amp;quot; -&amp;quot;enrollment of students&amp;quot;), the program could assign to the above
sentences identification (1. sentence), constituency (3., 4. sentences) and attributive
(last sentence) predicates, respectively.
Consider, however, the second sentence. Is it &amp;quot;amplification&amp;quot;? If yes, how is the
program supposed to conclude that this sentence is an elaboration of the first one?
How feasible is in general the computational recognition of the rhetorical
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.996366545454546">
predicates? And here comes an important question: how much domain and world
knowledge, as well as Al inferencing techniques, are needed?
And if yes, does not it seem that &amp;quot;amplification&amp;quot; is not fine and precise enough (I
can give many examples of propositions to which the rhetorical predicate
&amp;quot;amplification&amp;quot; is to be assigned, because they simply do not fit the definition of the
rest of the predicates)? Should not one introduce an additional predicate called e.g.
&amp;quot;initiation&amp;quot; which would be associated with the act of founding, setting up, opening,
organizing etc. something? This gives a rise to a second important question. Is the
set of rhetorical predicates given in [1] , [3] , [8] or [9] sufficient and precise enough
to describe the real world? But if we propose additional predicates, how far should
we go?
