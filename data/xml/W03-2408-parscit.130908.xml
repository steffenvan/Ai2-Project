Open Mind Word Expert is an imple-
mented active learning system that aims
to create large annotated corpora by tap-
ping into the world&apos;s vast pool of knowl-
edge. It does this by relying on the
vast number of Web users who con-
tribute their knowledge to data anno-
tation. Open Mind Word Expert fo-
cuses on building semantically anno-
tated corpora, by collecting word sense
tagging from the general public over
the Web. It is available at http://teach-
computers.org. During the first nine
months of activity, the system yielded
90,000 high quality tagged items at a
much lower cost than the traditional
method of hiring lexicographers.

<bodyText confidence="0.967821469387755">
A large range of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) applications require large amounts of anno-
tated data in order to ensure good performance and
high accuracy. While recent advances in NLP re-
search brought significant improvement in the per-
formance of NLP methods and algorithms, there
has been relatively little progress on addressing
the problem of obtaining annotated data required
by some of the highest-performing algorithms. As
a consequence, many of today&apos;s NLP applications
experience severe training data bottlenecks.
One notoriously difficult problem in under-
standing text has been Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (WSD). Ambiguity is very common (espe-
cially among the most common words — consider
the words &amp;quot;table,&amp;quot; or the phrase &amp;quot;computer fan&amp;quot;).
Humans, however, are so competent at figuring out
word senses from context that they usually do not
even notice the ambiguities. While a large num-
ber of efficient WSD algorithms have been de-
signed and implemented to date within the recent
SENSE VAL evaluation frameworks (Kilgarriff and
Palmer, 2000), (Preiss and Yarowsky, 2001), and
elsewhere, the availability of sense tagged data is
still a significant problem.
Most of the efforts in WSD have focused
on supervised learning algorithms, which usually
achieve the best performance at the cost of low re-
call. The main weakness of these methods is the
lack of widely available semantically tagged cor-
pora and the strong dependence of disambigua-
tion accuracy on the size of the training corpus.
For instance, one study reports that high preci-
sion WSD requires at least 500 examples per am-
biguous word (Ng, 1997)1. At a throughput of
one tagged example per minute (Edmonds, 2000),
and with about 20,000 ambiguous words in the
common English vocabulary, a simple calculation
leads to about 160,000 hours of tagging, which is
nothing less than 80 man-years of human annota-
tion work.2 Since the tagging process is usually
&apos;The number of examples required for a word is highly
connected to the word entropy. 500 represents an average.
2Similar data bottleneck problems are faced by many
other NLP applications. High quality part of speech tagging
for English requires about 3 million words annotated with
their part of speech. The state-of-the-art in syntactic pars-
ing in English is close to 88-89% , performance attainable by
training parser models on a corpus of about 600,000 words

done by trained lexicographers, it is very expen-
sive, and limits the size of such corpora to a hand-
ful of tagged texts.
In this paper, we present Open Mind Word Ex-
pert, a Web-based system that aims to create large
sense tagged corpora with the help of Web users.
The annotation workload is distributed among
millions of potential human annotators, which is
likely to significantly reduce the cost and the du-
ration of the annotation process. We investigate
the amount and quality of the data produced dur-
ing nine months of deployment of the activity, and
present results obtained during preliminary WSD
experiments that rely on this sense tagged data.
Open Mind Word Expert is a project that fol-
lows the Open Mind initiative (Stork, 1999). The
basic idea behind broad Open Mind initiative is
to use the information and knowledge obtainable
from the millions of existing Web users, to the end
of creating more intelligent software. Other Open
Mind projects related to natural language and
world knowledge include Open Mind 1001 Ques-
tions (Chklovski, 2003), which acquires knowl-
edge from millions of users, and Open Mind Com-
mon Sense (Singh, 2002).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9027479">
The availability of large amounts of semantically
tagged data is crucial for creating successful WSD
systems. Yet, as of today, only few sense tagged
corpora are publicly available.3
One of the first large scale hand tagging efforts
is reported in (Miller et al., 1993), where a sub-
set of the Brown corpus was tagged with Word-
Net(Miller, 1995) senses. The corpus includes a
total of 234,136 tagged word occurrences, out of
which 186,575 are polysemous. There are 88,058
noun occurrences of which 70,214 are polyse-
mous.
The next significant hand tagging task was re-
ported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), where 2,476
usages of interest were manually assigned with
manually parsed within the Penn Treebank project, an anno-
tation effort that required approximately 2 man-years of work
(Marcus et al., 1993). Information extraction, automatic sum-
marization, anaphora resolution, and other tasks also strongly
require large annotated corpora.

sense tags from the Longman Dictionary of Con-
temporary English (LDOCE). This corpus was
used in various experiments, with classification
accuracies ranging from 75% to 90%, depending
on the algorithm and features employed.
The high accuracy of the LEXAS system (Ng
and Lee, 1996) is due in part to the use of large
corpora. For this system, 192,800 word occur-
rences have been manually tagged with senses
from WordNet. The set of tagged words consists
of the 191 most frequently occurring nouns and
verbs. The authors mention that approximately
one man-year of effort was spent in tagging the
data set.
Recently, the SENSEVAL competitions have
been providing a good environment for the de-
velopment of supervised WSD systems, making
freely available large amounts of sense tagged data
for about 100 words. During S EN S EVA L- 1 (Kil-
garriff and Palmer, 2000), data for 35 words was
made available adding up to about 20,000 ex-
amples tagged with respect to the Hector dictio-
nary. The size of the tagged corpus increased with
S EN S E vAL-2 (Preiss and Yarowsky, 2001), when
13,000 additional examples were released for 73
polysemous words. This time, the semantic anno-
tations were performed with respect to WordNet.
Additionally, (Kilgarriff, 1998) mentions the
Hector corpus, which comprises about 300 word
types with 300-1000 tagged instances for each
word, selected from a 17 million word corpus.
With Open Mind Word Expert we aim to cre-
ate a very large sense tagged corpus by making
use of the incredible resource of knowledge con-
stituted by the millions of Web users. We use tech-
niques for active learning to utilize this resource
efficiently.

Open Mind Word Expert is a Web-based appli-
cation that allows contributors to annotate words
with their WordNet senses. Tagging is organized
by word: for each ambiguous word for which we
want to build a sense tagged corpus, users are pre-
sented with a set of natural language (English)
sentences that include an instance of the ambigu-
ous word.
The overall process proceeds as follows. mi-

<bodyText confidence="0.999981586206896">
tially, example sentences are extracted from a
large textual corpus. If other training data is not
available, a number of these sentences are pre-
sented to the users for tagging in Stage 1. Next,
this tagged collection is used as training data, and
active learning is used to identify in the remain-
ing corpus the examples that are &amp;quot;hard to tag&amp;quot;.
These are the examples that are presented to the
contributors for tagging in Stage 2. For all tag-
ging, users are asked to select the sense they find
to be the most appropriate in the given sentence.
The selection is made from a drop-down list con-
taining all WordNet senses of the current word,
plus two additional choices, &amp;quot;unclear&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;none
of the above.&amp;quot; The results of any automatic clas-
sification or the classification submitted by other
users are not presented so as to not bias the con-
tributor&apos;s decisions. Based on early feedback from
both researchers and contributors, a future version
of Open Mind Word Expert may allow contribu-
tors to specify more than one sense for a given in-
stance. As will be elaborated below, the current
approach of collecting redundant tagging already
addresses this to some degree.
A prototype of the system has been imple-
mented and is available at http://www.teach-
computers.org. Figure 1 shows a screen shot from
the system interface, illustrating the screen pre-
sented to users when tagging the noun &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot;.

the Web (Singh, 2002)6. A mix of several sources,
each covering a different spectrum of usage, is

3.2 Active Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985097560976">
To minimize the amount of human annotation ef-
fort needed to build a tagged corpus for a given
ambiguous word, Open Mind Word Expert in-
cludes an active learning component that has the
role of selecting for annotation only those exam-
ples that are the most informative.
According to (Dagan et al., 1995), there are two
main types of active learning. The first one uses
memberships queries, in which the learner con-
structs examples and asks a user to label them. In
natural language processing tasks, this approach is
not always applicable, since it is hard and not al-
ways possible to construct meaningful unlabeled
examples for training Instead, a second type of
active learning can be applied to these tasks, which
is selective sampling. In this case, several classi-
fiers examine the unlabeled data and identify only
those examples that are the most informative, that
is the examples where a certain level of disagree-
ment is measured among the classifiers.
We use a simplified form of active learning
with selective sampling, where the instances to be
tagged are selected as those instances where there
is a disagreement between the labels assigned by
two different classifiers. The two classifiers are
trained on a relatively small corpus of tagged data,
which is formed either with (1) Senseval training
examples, in the case of Senseval words, or (2) ex-
amples obtained with the Open Mind Word Expert
system itself, when no other training data is avail-
able.
The first classifier is a Semantic Tagger with
Active Feature Selection (STAFS). This system is
one of the top ranked systems in the English lexi-
cal sample task at SENSEVAL-2. The system con-
sists of an instance based learning algorithm im-
proved with a scheme for automatic feature se-
lection. It relies on the fact that different sets of
features have different effects depending on the
ambiguous word considered. Rather than creat-
ing a general learning model for all polysemous

words, STAFS builds a separate feature space for
each individual word. The features are selected
from a pool of eighteen different features that have
been previously acknowledged as good indicators
of word sense, including: part of speech of the am-
biguous word itself, surrounding words and their
parts of speech, keywords in context, noun be-
fore and after, verb before and after, and others.
An iterative forward search algorithm identifies at
each step the feature that leads to the highest cross-
validation precision computed on the training data.
More details on this system can be found in (Mi-
halcea, 2002).
The second classifier is a COnstraint-BAsed
Language Tagger (COBALT). The system treats
every training example as a set of soft constraints
on the sense of the word of interest. WordNet
glosses, hyponyms, hyponym glosses and other
WordNet data is also used to create soft con-
straints. Currently, only &amp;quot;keywords in context&amp;quot;
type of constraint is implemented, with weights
accounting for the distance from the target word.
The tagging is performed by finding the sense that
minimizes the violation of constraints in the in-
stance being tagged. COBALT generates confi-
dences in its tagging of a given instance based on
how much the constraints were satisfied and vio-
lated for that instance.
Both taggers use WordNet 1.7 dictionary
glosses and relations. The performance of the two
systems and their level of agreement were eval-
uated on the Senseval noun data set. The two
systems agreed in their classification decision in
54.96% of the cases. This low agreement level
is a good indication that the two approaches are
fairly orthogonal, and therefore we may hope for
high disambiguation precision on the agreement
set. Indeed, the tagging accuracy measured on the
set where both COBALT and STAFS assign the
same label is 82.5%, a fairly high figure.
Table 1 lists the precision for the agreement and
disagreement sets of the two taggers. The low pre-
cision on the instances in the disagreement set jus-
tifies referring to these as &amp;quot;hard to tag&amp;quot;. In Open
Mind Word Expert, these are the instances that are

3.3 Ensuring Quality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997846">
Collecting from the general public holds the
promise of providing much data at low cost. It also
makes attending to two aspects of data collection
more important: (1) ensuring contribution quality,
and (2) making the contribution process engaging
to the contributors.
To ensure contribution quality, redundant tag-
ging is collected for each item. Open Mind Word
Expert currently uses the following rules in pre-
senting items to volunteer contributors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998454">
• Two tags per item. Once an item has two tags
associated with it, it is not presented for fur-
ther tagging.
• One tag per item per contributor. We allow
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.876616105263158">
contributors to submit tagging either anony-
mously or having logged in. Anonymous
contributors are not shown any items already
tagged by contributors (anonymous or not)
from the same IP address. Logged in contrib-
utors are not shown items they have already
tagged.
In all, automatic assessment of the quality of
tagging seems possible, and, based on the expe-
rience of similar volunteer contribution projects
(Singh, 2002), the rate of maliciously misleading
or incorrect contributions has been surprisingly
low.
Moreover, since we plan to use paid, trained
taggers to create a separate test corpus for several
of the words tagged with Open Mind Word Expert,
these same paid taggers could also validate a small
percentage of the training data for which no gold
standard exists.

4 Results after nine months of activity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924590909091">
During the first nine months of activity, Open
Mind Word Expert has collected more than 90,000
individual sense taggings from contributors. Of
that number, approximately 16,500 tags came
from using Open Mind Word Expert in the class-
rooms as a teaching aid (the web site provides spe-
cial features for this). Future rate of collection de-
pends on the site being listed in various directories
and on the contributor repeat visit rate (we are also
experimenting with prizes to encourage participa-
tion).
There are two main figures that we measured to
evaluate the quality of the annotation task. One
is inter tagger agreement, which represents the
agreement between the tags assigned by two dif-
ferent annotators. The other is replicability, which
measures the degree to which an annotation exper-
iment can be replicated. According to (Kilganiff,
1999), the capability of recreating a set of anno-
tated data is an indicator for annotation quality that
is even more important than the inter-annotator
agreement.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.496955">
4.1 Inter-Tagger Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992590909091">
In terms of inter-annotator agreement, the results
obtained so far can be directly compared with the
agreement figures previously reported in the lit-
erature. (Kilgarriff, 2002) mentions that for the
SENSEVAL-2 nouns and adjectives there was a
66.5% agreement between the first two tags col-
lected for each item. About 12% of their tagging
consisted of multi-word expressions and proper
nouns, which are usually not ambiguous, and
which are not considered during our data collec-
tion process. So far we measured a 62.8% inter-
tagger agreement for single word tagging, plus
close-to- l 00% precision in tagging multi-word ex-
pressions and proper nouns (as mentioned ear-
lier, this represents about 12% of the annotated
data). This results in an overall agreement of about
66.56% which is reasonable and closely compara-
ble with previous figures.
In addition to raw inter-tagger agreement, the
kappa statistic was also determined, which re-
moves from the agreement rate the amount of
agreement that is expected by chance (Carletta,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996665">

<bodyText confidence="0.999986333333333">
1996). With an average of 5 senses per word,
the average value for the chance agreement is
20%9. This results in a kappa statistic of 58.2%.
Since previous sense annotation experiments have
not used this statistic to evaluate the inter-tagger
agreement, we have no base for comparison.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978573">
4.2 Replicability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.86685685106383">
To measure the replicability of the tagging process
performed through Open Mind Word Expert, we
had to replicate a tagging experiment where the
annotation was performed with &amp;quot;trusted humans.&amp;quot;
To this end, we used the data set for the noun
&amp;quot;interest,&amp;quot; created and made available by (Bruce
and Wiebe, 1994). In this data set, consisting of
2,369 examples, the annotation was done with re-
spect to LDOCE, and therefore we had first to map
the sense entries from this dictionary to Word-
Net, which is the sense inventory used by Open
Mind Word Expert. The mapping did not pose
any particular problems, and consists of one-to-
one mappings for the six LDOCE entries, plus one
WordNet entry not defined in LDOCE, for which
we discarded all corresponding examples from the
Open Mind annotation.
Next, we identified and eliminated all the ex-
amples in the corpus that contained collocations
(e.g. &amp;quot;interest rate&amp;quot;); these examples accounted
for more than 35% of the data. Finally, the remain-
ing 1,438 examples were displayed on the Open
Mind Word Expert site for tagging.
Out of the 1,438 examples, 1,066 had two tags
that agreed, therefore a 74% inter-annotator agree-
ment for single words taggine . Out of these
1,066 items, 967 have a tag that coincides with
the tag assigned in the experiments reported in
(Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), which leads to an 90.8%
replicability for single words tagging (note that the
35% monosemous multi-word expressions are not
taken into account by this figure). This is close to
9Note that ideally the chance agreement should take into
consideration the entropy of word senses, which implies the
availability of sense annotated examples other than those that
we are evaluating. Since such examples are not available for
all the words in the Open Mind tagged collection, the chance
agreement was determined using a simplified assumption of
uniform sense distribution
mAdding the 35% monosemous multi-word expressions
tagged with 100% precision, leads to an overall 83% inter-
tagger agreement for this particular word

<bodyText confidence="0.967238617647059">
For additional evaluations of the quality of the
data collected through the Open Mind Word Ex-
pert, we used these data sets in disambiguation ex-
periments, performed using the STAFS WSD sys-
tem with a fixed set of features, and consisting in
10-fold cross validation runs. We also computed
a simple baseline, consisting of a simple heuris-
tic that assigns the most frequent sense by de-
fault (also computed during 10-fold cross valida-
tion runs). Table 3 lists all words for which we col-
lected sense tagged data with Open Mind Word Ex-
pert, the number of items with full inter-annotator
agreement, the most frequent sense baseline, and
the precision achieved with STAFS&amp;quot;.
For the 280 words for which data was collected
using Open Mind Word Expert, the average num-
ber of examples per word is 87. The most frequent
sense heuristic yields correct results in 63.32%
overall. When disambiguation is performed using
STAFS, restricting the system to a simple set of
features consisting of the word itself, the word&apos;s
part of speech, and a surrounding context of two
(words and their corresponding parts of speech),
the overall precision is 66.23%, which represents
an error reduction of about 9% with respect to the
most frequent sense heuristic, providing additional
evidence of usefulness of this corpus.
Moreover, the average for the 72 words which
have at least 100 training examples is 75.88%

tion of 19%. When at least 200 examples are
available per word, the most frequent sense heuris-
tic is correct 63.48% of the time, and STAFS is
correct 72.18% of the time, which represents a
24% reduction in disambiguation error. Table 2
lists the precisions obtained with the most fre-
quent sense heuristic and STAFS, as a function
of corpus size. The reduction in error rate grows
steadily with the number of training examples. For
the words for which more data was collected with
Open Mind Word Expert, the improvement over
the most frequent sense baseline was larger. This
agrees with prior work by other researchers (Ng,
1997), (Banko and Brill, 2001), who noted that
additional annotated data is likely to bring larger
improvements in disambiguation quality.

5 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983739103448276">
Open Mind Word Expert has the potential of cre-
ating a large sense tagged corpus. In this paper
we investigated the amount and quality of data
collected during the first nine months of deploy-
ment of the activity. The experiments performed
showed that the inter-tagger agreement, replica-
bility, and disambiguation results obtained on this
data are comparable with what can be obtained us-
ing data collected with the traditional method of
hiring lexicographers, at a much lower cost.
The English sense tagged corpus collected
with Open Mind Word Expert is continuously
growing, and will provide annotated data for the
English SENSEVAL-3 lexical sample task. Two
new editions, Romanian Open Mind Word Expert
and Bilingual Open Mind Word Expert will soon
be deployed. Other languages are also likely to be
added in the near future.

<abstract confidence="0.999844555555555">Open Mind Word Expert is an implemented active learning system that aims to create large annotated corpora by tapping into the world&apos;s vast pool of knowledge. It does this by relying on the vast number of Web users who contribute their knowledge to data annotation. Open Mind Word Expert focuses on building semantically annotated corpora, by collecting word sense tagging from the general public over the Web. It is available at http://teachcomputers.org. During the first nine months of activity, the system yielded 90,000 high quality tagged items at a much lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers.</abstract>

This agrees with prior work by other researchers (Ng, 1997), (Banko and Brill, 2001), who noted that additional annotated data is likely to bring larger improvements in disambiguation quality. 5 Conclusions and future work Open Mind Word Expert has the potential of creating a large sense tagged corpus. In this paper we investigated the amount and quality of data collected during the first nine months of deployment of the activity. The experiments performed showed that the inter-tagger agreement, replicability, and disambiguation results obtained on this data are comparable with what can be obtained using data collected with the traditional method of hiring lexicographers, at </context>

Since previous sense annotation experiments have not used this statistic to evaluate the inter-tagger agreement, we have no base for comparison. 4.2 Replicability To measure the replicability of the tagging process performed through Open Mind Word Expert, we had to replicate a tagging experiment where the annotation was performed with &amp;quot;trusted humans.&amp;quot; To this end, we used the data set for the noun &amp;quot;interest,&amp;quot; created and made available by (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). In this data set, consisting of 2,369 examples, the annotation was done with respect to LDOCE, and therefore we had first to map the sense entries from this dictionary to WordNet, which is the sense inventory used by Open Mind Word Expert. The mapping did not pose any particular problems, and consists of one-toone mappings for the six LDOCE entries, plus one WordNet entry not defined in LDOCE, for which we discarded all corresponding examples from the Open Mind annotation. Next, we identified and eliminated all the examples in the corpus that contained collocations (e.g. &amp;quot;interest rate&amp;quot;); th</context>

Most of the efforts in WSD have focused on supervised learning algorithms, which usually achieve the best performance at the cost of low recall. The main weakness of these methods is the lack of widely available semantically tagged corpora and the strong dependence of disambiguation accuracy on the size of the training corpus. For instance, one study reports that high precision WSD requires at least 500 examples per ambiguous word (Ng, 1997)1. At a throughput of one tagged example per minute (Edmonds, 2000), and with about 20,000 ambiguous words in the common English vocabulary, a simple calculation leads to about 160,000 hours of tagging, which is nothing less than 80 man-years of human annotation work.2 Since the tagging process is usually &apos;The number of examples required for a word is highly connected to the word entropy. 500 represents an average. 2Similar data bottleneck problems are faced by many other NLP applications.

An iterative forward search algorithm identifies at each step the feature that leads to the highest crossvalidation precision computed on the training data. More details on this system can be found in (Mihalcea, 2002). The second classifier is a COnstraint-BAsed Language Tagger (COBALT).

Open Mind Word Expert is a project that follows the Open Mind initiative (Stork, 1999). The basic idea behind broad Open Mind initiative is to use the information and knowledge obtainable from the millions of existing Web users, to the end of creating more intelligent software. Other Open Mind projects related to natural language and world knowledge include Open Mind 1001 Questions (Chklovski, 2003), which acquires knowledge from millions of users, and Open Mind Common Sense (Singh, 2002). 2 Sense Tagged Corpora The availability of large amounts of semantically tagged data is crucial for creating successful WSD systems. Yet, as of today, only few sense tagged corpora are publicly available.3 One of the first large scale hand tagging efforts is reported in (Miller et al., 1993), where a subset of the Brown corpus was tagged with WordNet(Miller, 1995) senses. The corpus includes a total of 234,136 tagged word occurrences, out of which 186,575 are polysemous. There are 88,058 noun occurrences of which 70,214 are polysemous. The next significant hand tagging task was reported in (</context>

Once an item has two tags associated with it, it is not presented for further tagging. • One tag per item per contributor. We allow contributors to submit tagging either anonymously or having logged in. Anonymous contributors are not shown any items already tagged by contributors (anonymous or not) from the same IP address. Logged in contributors are not shown items they have already tagged. In all, automatic assessment of the quality of tagging seems possible, and, based on the experience of similar volunteer contribution projects (Singh, 2002), the rate of maliciously misleading or incorrect contributions has been surprisingly low. Moreover, since we plan to use paid, trained taggers to create a separate test corpus for several of the words tagged with Open Mind Word Expert, these same paid taggers could also validate a small percentage of the training data for which no gold standard exists. 4 Results after nine months of activity During the first nine months of activity, Open Mind Word Expert has collected more than 90,000 individual sense taggings from contributors. Of that number, approximately 16,500 tags came from using Open M</context>
