<bodyText confidence="0.999811692307692">
A web based Manipuri corpus is devel-
oped for identification of reduplicated
multiword expression (MWE) and mul-
tiword named entity recognition (NER).
Manipuri is one of the rarely investi-
gated language and its resources for
natural language processing are not
available in the required measure. The
web content of Manipuri is also very
poor. News corpus from a popular Ma-
nipuri news website is collected. Ap-
proximately four and a half million Ma-
nipuri wordforms have been collected
from the web. The mode of corpus col-
lection and the identification of redupli-
cated MWEs and multiword NE based
on support vector machine (SVM)
learning technique are reported. The
SVM based reduplicated MWE system
is evaluated with recall, precision and F-
Score values of 94.62%, 93.53% and
94.07% respectively outperforming the
rule based approach. The recall, preci-
sion and F-Score for multiword NE are
evaluated as 94.82%, 93.12% and
93.96% respectively.

The NER and MWE identification are important
tasks for natural language applications that in-
clude machine translation and information re-
trieval. The present work reports the NER and
reduplicated MWE identification of Manipuri
on web based news corpus. The use of web as a
corpus for teaching and research on languages
has been proposed several times (Rundell, 2000;
Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher 2004). A
special issue of the Computational Linguistics
journal on web as corpus (Kilgarriff and Gre-
fenstette, 2003) was published. Several studies
have used different methods to mine web data.
The web walked into the ACL meetings starting
in 1999. The special interest group of ACL on
web as corpus is promoting interest in the use of
the web as a source of linguistic data, and as an
object of study in its own right. India is a multi-
lingual country with a lot of cultural diversity.
Bharati et al. (2001) reports an effort to create
lexical resources such as transfer lexicon and
grammar from English to several Indian lan-
guages and dependency Treebank of annotated
corpora for several Indian languages. In Indian
context, a web based Bengali corpus develop-
ment work from web is reported in Ekbal and
Bandyopadhyay (2008) and Manipuri-English
semi automatic parallel corpora extraction by
Singh et. al., (2010). Newspaper is a huge
source of readily available documents. In the
present work, the Manipuri monolingual corpus
has been developed from web for NLP and re-
lated tasks.
Manipuri is a scheduled Indian language
spoken approximately by three million people
mainly in the state of Manipur in India and in
the neighboring countries namely Bangladesh
and Myanmar. It is a Tibeto-Burman language
and highly agglutinative in nature, influenced
and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of
Sanskrit origin and English. The affixes play the
most important role in the structure of the lan-
guage. In Manipuri, words are formed in three
processes called affixation, derivation and com-
pounding. The majority of the roots found in the

language are bound and the affixes are the de-
termining factor of the class of the words in the
language. Annotated corpus, bilingual dictiona-
ries, name dictionaries, WordNet, morphologi-
cal analyzers etc. are not yet available in Mani-
puri in the required measure.
In the present work, the tasks of identifica-
tion of Manipuri multiword named entity (MNE)
and reduplicated multiword expression (RMWE)
identification using support vector machine
(SVM) learning technique on the corpus col-
lected from web is reported.
Works on multiword expressions (MWEs)
have started with a momentum in different lan-
guages. In the Indian context, some of the
works can be seen in (Dandapat et. al., 2006;
Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008; Kishorjit et.
al., 2010). The identification of MWEs in sev-
eral languages concentrate on compound nouns,
noun-verb combination, some on idioms and
phrases and so on but not much on RMWEs.
The reason may be that the reduplicated words
are either rare or easy to identify for these lan-
guages since only complete duplication and
some amount of partial reduplication may be
present in these languages. On the other hand,
reduplicated MWEs are quite large in number in
Manipuri and there are wide varieties of redup-
licated MWEs in Manipuri.

2 Manipuri News Corpus and Statis-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998798133333333">
The content of Manipuri language on the web is
very poor. One of the sources is the daily news
publications. Again, there is no repository. Thus,
the possibility of deploying web crawler and
mining the web corpus is not possible. The Ma-
nipuri news corpus is collected from
http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/ covering the
period from May 2008 to May 2010 on daily
basis. The Manipuri news is available in PDF
format. A tool has been developed to convert
contents from PDF documents to Unicode for-
mat. There are 15-20 articles in each day. Con-
sidering the Manipuri corpus covering the pe-
riod from May 2008 to May 2010, there are
4649016 wordforms collected1.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996215">
The general Manipuri news collected is in PDF
format. A tool has been developed to convert
Manipuri news PDF articles to Bengali Unicode.
The Bengali Unicode characters are used to
represent Manipuri as well. The conversion of
PDF format into Unicode involves the conver-
sion to ASCII and then into Unicode using
mapping tables between the ASCII characters
and corresponding Bengali Unicode. The map-
ping tables have been prepared at different le-
vels with separate tables for single characters
and conjuncts with two or more than two cha-
racters. The single character mapping table con-
tains 72 entries and the conjunct characters
mapping table consists of 738 entries. There are
conjuncts of 2, 3 and 4 characters. Sub-tables
for each of the conjuncts are prepared. English
words are present on the Manipuri side of the
news and they are filtered to avoid unknown
character features.

The Manipuri web corpus collected from the
web is cleaned by removing the unknown cha-
racters. After the cleaning process, the running
texts are picked up followed by spelling correc-
tion. The web based news corpus is POS tagged
using the 26 tagset2 defined for the Indian lan-
guages based on the work of (Singh et. al.,
2008). The Manipuri news corpus developed in
this work has been used to identify MNE and
RMWEs identification.

3 Support Vector Machine

<bodyText confidence="0.999890416666667">
The SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is based on discri-
minative approach and makes use of both posi-
tive and negative examples to learn the distinc-
tion between the two classes. The SVMs are
known to robustly handle large feature sets and
to develop models that maximize their generali-
zability. Suppose we have a set of training data
for a two-class problem: ,
where x;  RD is a feature vector of the ith sam-
ple in the training data and y;  {+1, -1} is the
class to which x; belongs. The goal is to find a
decision function that accurately predicts class y

for an input vector x. A non-linear SVM clas-
sifier gives a decision function f (x)= sign (g (x))
for an input vector where,
Here, f(x)=+1 means
x is a member of a certain class and f(x)=-1
means x is not a member. The support vector is
represented by zi and stands for the training ex-
amples; m is the number of support vectors
Therefore, the computational complexity of g(x)
is proportional to m. Support vectors and other
constants are determined by solving a certain
quadratic programming problem. K(x, zc) is a
kernel that implicitly maps vectors into a higher
dimensional space. Typical kernels use dot
products: .A polynomial ker-
nel of degree d is given by = (1+x)d.
We can use various kernels, and the design of
an appropriate kernel for a particular application
is an important research issue.
The MNE/RMWE tagging system includes
two main phases: training and classification.
The training process has been carried out by
YamCha3 toolkit, an SVM based tool for detect-
ing classes in documents and formulating the
MNE/RMWE tagging task as a sequence labe-
ling problem. Here, both one vs rest and pair-
wise multi-class decision methods have been
used. Different experiments with the various
degrees of the polynomial kernel function have
been carried out. In one vs rest strategy, K bi-
nary SVM classifiers may be created where
each classifier is trained to distinguish one class
from the remaining K-1 classes. In pairwise
classification, we constructed K (K-1)/2 clas-
sifiers considering all pairs of classes, and the
final decision is given by their weighted voting.
For classification, the TinySVM-0.074 classifier
has been used that seems to be the best opti-
mized among publicly available SVM toolkits.

4 Multiword Named Entity Recogni-
tion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.819844775">
Named Entity Recognition for Manipuri is re-
ported in (Singh et. al., 2009). The present work
focuses and reports on the recognition of mul-
tiword NEs. In order to identify the MNEs,
28,629 wordforms from Manipuri news corpus
has been manually annotated and used as train-
ing data with the major named entity (NE) tags,
namely person name, location name, organiza-
tion name and miscellaneous name to apply
Support Vector Machine (SVM) based machine
learning technique. Miscellaneous name in-
cludes the festival name, name of objects, name
of building, date, time, measurement expression
and percentage expression etc. The SVM based
system makes use of the different contextual
information of the words along with the variety
of word-level orthographic features that are
helpful in predicting the MNE classes.
MNE identification in Indian languages as
well as in Manipuri is difficult and challenging
as:
■ Unlike English and most of the European lan-
guages, Manipuri lacks capitalization infor-
mation, which plays a very important role in
identifying MNEs.
■ A lot of MNEs in Manipuri can appear in the
dictionary with some other specific meanings.
■ Manipuri is a highly inflectional language
providing one of the richest and most chal-
lenging sets of linguistic and statistical fea-
tures resulting in long and complex word-
forms.
■ Manipuri is a relatively free word order lan-
guage. Thus MNEs can appear in subject and
object positions making the NER task more
difficult compared to others.
■ Manipuri is a resource-constrained language.
Annotated corpus, name dictionaries, sophis-
ticated morphological analyzers, POS taggers
etc. are not yet available.

5 Reduplicated MWEs Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997386842105263">
Manipuri is very rich in RMWEs like other Ti-
beto-Burman languages. The work of (Singh,
2000) describes the linguistic rules for identify-
ing reduplicated words. A rule based Manipuri
RMWE identification is reported in (Kishorjit
and Bandyopadhyay, 2010). The process of re-
duplication (Singh, 2000) is defined as: ‘redup-
lication is that repetition, the result of which
constitutes a unit word’. These single unit
words are the MWEs. The RMWEs in Manipuri
are classified as: 1) Complete RMWEs, 2) Par-
tial RMWEs, 3) Echo RMWEs and 4) Mimic
RMWEs. Apart from these four types of
RMWEs, there are also cases of a) Double
RMWEs and b) Semantic RMWEs.
Complete RMWEs: In the complete
RMWEs the single word or clause is repeated
once forming a single unit regardless of phono-
logical or morphological variations.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.903269">
মরিক মরিক (‘marik marik’) which means
‘drop by drop’.
অটেক অটেকপা (‘atek atek-pa’ ) which
means ‘fresh’
করি করি (‘kari kari’) means ‘what/which’.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999354433333334">
Partial RMWEs: In case of partial
reduplication the second word carries some part
of the first word as an affix to the second word,
either as a suffix or a prefix.
For example, চটথাক চরসিন (‘chat-thok chat-
sin’) means ‘to go to and fro’; শামী লানমী (‘saa-mi
laan-mi’) means ‘army’.
Mimic RMWEs: In the mimic
reduplication the words are complete
reduplication but the morphemes are
onomatopoetic, usually emotional or natural
sounds. For example, কিক কিক (‘krak krak’ )
means ‘cracking sound of earth in drought’.
Echo RMWEs: The second word does not
have a dictionary meaning and is basically an
echo word of the first word. For example, থকরি
খারি (‘thak-si kha-si‘) means ‘good manner’.
Double RMWEs: Such type of reduplica-
tion generally consists of three words where the
prefix or suffix of the first two words is redupli-
cated but in the third word the prefix or suffix is
absent. An example of double prefix reduplica-
tion is ইমুন ইমুন মুনবা (‘i-mun i-mun mun-ba’)
which means, ‘completely ripe’.
Semantic RMWEs: Both the reduplication
words have the same meaning and so also is the
MWE. Such types of MWEs are very special to
the Manipuri language. For example, পামবা কক
(‘paamba kei’) means ‘tiger’ and each of the
component words means ‘tiger’.

ripe ripe
‘very ripe’
Role of affix in Partial Reduplication:
Character-wise comparisons are done with not
less than two characters either from front or rear
for both the words since the second word is not
a complete repetition.
Also the last few characters of the first
word and the same number of first characters of
the second word are compared to check the par-
tial reduplication. The prefixes or suffixes are
verified with a list of accepted suffixes and pre-
fixes (see table 2) to validated the reduplication.
Role of affix in Echo Reduplication:
Identification of echo reduplication is done by
comparing the equality of suffixes of consecu-
tive two words w1 and w2.

6 Best Feature Selection for SVM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994912307692307">
The use of prefix/suffix information works well
for the highly inflected languages like the In-
dian languages. Different combinations from
the following set for identifying the best feature
set for MNE/RMWE are experimented:
F={ wi - m_, wi -1, wi, wi + 1, ..... Wi + n , |prefix|&lt;=n,
|suffix|&lt;=n, MNE/RMWE tag(s) of previous
word(s), POS tag(s) of the current and/or the
surrounding word(s), First word, Length of the
word, Digit information, Infrequent word},
where is the current word; is the
previous mth word and is the next nth
word. Following are the details of the features:
1 Context word feature: Preceding and fol-
lowing words of a particular word since
the surrounding words carry effective in-
formation for the identification of
MNE/RMWEs.
2 Word suffix: Word suffix information is
helpful to identify MNE/RMWEs. This is
based on the observation that the
MNE/RMWEs share some common suf-
fixes. The fixed length (say, n) word suf-
fix of the current and/or the surrounding
word(s) can be treated as the feature. If
the length of the corresponding word is
less than or equal to n − 1 then the feature
values are not defined and are denoted by
‘ND’. The feature value is also not de-
fined (ND) if the token itself is a punctua-
tion symbol or contains any special sym-
bol or digit. Word suffixes are the effec-
tive features and work well for the highly
inflective Indian languages like Manipuri.
3 Word prefix: Word prefixes are also help-
ful to identify MNE/RMWEs. It is based
on the observation that MNE/RMWEs
share some common prefix strings. This
feature has been defined in a similar way
as that of the fixed length suffixes.
4 MNE and RMWE Information: The
MNE/RMWE tag(s) of the previous
word(s) have been used as the only dy-
namic feature in the experiment. The out-
put tag of the previous word is very in-
formative in deciding the MNE/RMWE
tag of the current word.
5 Digit features: Several binary valued digit
features have been defined depending
upon the
(i). Presence and/or the exact number
of digits in a token.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934175882352941">
(a). CntDgtCma: Token consists of
digits and comma
(b). CntDgtPrd: Token consists of
digits and periods
(ii). Combination of digits and sym-
bols. For example,
(a). CntDgtSlsh: Token consists of
digit and slash
(b). CntDgtHph: Token consists of
digits and hyphen
(c). CntDgtPrctg: Token consists of
digits and percentages
(iii). Combination of digit and special
symbols. For example,
(a). CntDgtSpl: Token consists of
digit and special symbol such as $,
# etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.948267361111111">
These binary valued digit features are
helpful in recognizing miscellaneous
NEs such as measurement expression
and percentage expression.
6 Infrequent word: The frequencies of the
words in the training corpus have been
calculated. A cut off frequency has been
chosen in order to consider the words that
occur with less than the cut off frequency
in the training corpus. A binary valued
feature ‘Infrequent’ is defined to check
whether the current word appears in this
infrequent word list or not. This is based
on the observation that the infrequent
words are most probably MNE/RMWEs.
7 Length of a word: This binary valued fea-
ture is used to check whether the length
of the current word is less than three or
not. We have observed that very short
words are most probably not the
MNE/RMWEs.
8 Part of Speech (POS) information:
We have used an SVM-based POS
tagger (Singh et. al., 2008) that was
originally developed with 26 POS
tags, defined for the Indian languages.
The POS information of the current
and/or the surrounding words can be
effective for MNE/RMWE identifica-
tion.
The Table 3 gives the statistics of training,
development and test sets. The various nota-
tions used in the experiments are presented in

cision (P) and F-Score (FS) in percentage in the

In this paper, the development of RMWEs iden-
tification and recognition of MNE for a re-
source-constrained language using web based
corpus of Manipuri is reported. This training
data of 28,629 is then manually annotated with
a coarse-grained tagset of four NE tags and six
RMWEs in order to apply SVM and tested with
4,763 wordforms. The SVM classifier makes
use of the different contextual information of
the words along with the various orthographic
word-level features. A number of experiments
have been carried out to find out the best set of
features for MWE in Manipuri. The SVM based
RMWE system outperforms the rule based ap-
proach. The SVM based RMWE shows recall,
precision and F-Score of 94.62%, 93.53% and
94.07% respectively. The rule based RMWE

<abstract confidence="0.993994222222222">A web based Manipuri corpus is developed for identification of reduplicated multiword expression (MWE) and multiword named entity recognition (NER). Manipuri is one of the rarely investigated language and its resources for natural language processing are not available in the required measure. The web content of Manipuri is also very poor. News corpus from a popular Manipuri news website is collected. Approximately four and a half million Manipuri wordforms have been collected from the web. The mode of corpus collection and the identification of reduplicated MWEs and multiword NE based on support vector machine (SVM) learning technique are reported. The SVM based reduplicated MWE system is evaluated with recall, precision and F- Score values of 94.62%, 93.53% and 94.07% respectively outperforming the rule based approach. The recall, precision and F-Score for multiword NE are evaluated as 94.82%, 93.12% and 93.96% respectively.</abstract>

Table 1 shows examples. 5 Reduplicated MWEs Identification Manipuri is very rich in RMWEs like other Tibeto-Burman languages. The work of (Singh, 2000) describes the linguistic rules for identifying reduplicated words. A rule based Manipuri RMWE identification is reported in (Kishorjit and Bandyopadhyay, 2010). The process of reduplication (Singh, 2000) is defined as: ‘reduplication is that repetition, the result of which constitutes a unit word’. These single unit words are the MWEs. The RMWEs in Manipuri are classified as: 1) Complete RMWEs, 2) Partial RMWEs, 3) Echo RMWEs and 4) Mimic RMWEs. Apart from these four types of RMWEs, there are also cases of a) Double RMWEs and b) Semantic RMWEs.

Annotated corpus, bilingual dictionaries, name dictionaries, WordNet, morphological analyzers etc. are not yet available in Manipuri in the required measure. In the present work, the tasks of identification of Manipuri multiword named entity (MNE) and reduplicated multiword expression (RMWE) identification using support vector machine (SVM) learning technique on the corpus collected from web is reported. Works on multiword expressions (MWEs) have started with a momentum in different languages. In the Indian context, some of the works can be seen in (Dandapat et. al., 2006; Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008; Kishorjit et. al., 2010). The identification of MWEs in several languages concentrate on compound nouns, noun-verb combination, some on idioms and phrases and so on but not much on RMWEs. The reason may be that the reduplicated words are either rare or easy to identify for these languages since only complete duplication and some amount of partial reduplication may be present in these languages. On the other hand, reduplicated MWEs are quite large in number in Manipuri and there are wide varieties of reduplicated MWEs in Manipuri. 2 Manipuri News Corpus and Statistics The content of Manipuri </context>

After the cleaning process, the running texts are picked up followed by spelling correction. The web based news corpus is POS tagged using the 26 tagset2 defined for the Indian languages based on the work of (Singh et. al., 2008). The Manipuri news corpus developed in this work has been used to identify MNE and RMWEs identification. 3 Support Vector Machine The SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is based on discriminative approach and makes use of both positive and negative examples to learn the distinction between the two classes. The SVMs are known to robustly handle large feature sets and to develop models that maximize their generalizability. Suppose we have a set of training data for a two-class problem: , where x;  RD is a feature vector of the ith sample in the training data and y;  {+1, -1} is the class to which x; belongs. The goal is to find a decision function that accurately predicts class y 2http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.p df 36 for an input </context>
