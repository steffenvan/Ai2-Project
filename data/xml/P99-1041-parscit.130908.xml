Non-compositional expressions present a special
challenge to NLP applications. We present a method
for automatic identification of non-compositional ex-
pressions using their statistical properties in a text
corpus. Our method is based on the hypothesis that
when a phrase is non-composition, its mutual infor-
mation differs significantly from the mutual infor-
mations of phrases obtained by substituting one of
the word in the phrase with a similar word.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997834375">
Non-compositional expressions present a special
challenge to NLP applications. In machine transla-
tion, word-for-word translation of non-compositional
expressions can result in very misleading (sometimes
laughable) translations. In information retrieval, ex-
pansion of words in a non-compositional expression
can lead to dramatic decrease in precision without
any gain in recall. Less obviously, non-compositional
expressions need to be treated differently than other
phrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLP
methods. For example, an underlying assumption in
some word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Da-
gan and Itai, 1994; Li et al., 1995; Lin, 1997), is that
if two words occurred in the same context, they are
probably similar. Suppose we want to determine the
intended meaning of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot product&amp;quot;.
We can find other words that are also modified by
&amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;hot car&amp;quot;) and then choose the mean-
ing of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; that is most similar to meanings
of these words. However, this method fails when
non-compositional expressions are involved. For in-
stance, using the same algorithm to determine the
meaning of &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot line&amp;quot;, the words &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;merchandise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;, etc., would lead the algorithm
to choose the &amp;quot;line of product&amp;quot; sense of &amp;quot;line&amp;quot;.
We present a method for automatic identification
of non-compositional expressions using their statis-
tical properties in a text corpus. The intuitive idea
behind the method is that the metaphorical usage
of a non-compositional expression causes it to have
a different distributional characteristic than expres-
sions that are similar to its literal meaning.

2 Input Data

The input to our algorithm is a collocation database
and a thesaurus. We briefly describe the process of
obtaining this input. More details about the con-
struction of the collocation database and the the-
saurus can be found in (Lin, 1998).
We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus
with Minipar,1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993;
Lin, 1994), and extracted dependency relationships
from the parsed corpus. A dependency relationship
is a triple: (head type modifier), where head and
modifier are words in the input sentence and type
is the type of the dependency relation. For example,
(la) is an example dependency tree and the set of
dependency triples extracted from (la) are shown in
(lb).

<bodyText confidence="0.999202307692308">
There are about 80 million dependency relation-
ships in the parsed corpus. The frequency counts of
dependency relationships are filtered with the log-
likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). We call a depen-
dency relationship a collocation if its log-likelihood
ratio is greater than a threshold (0.5). The number
of unique collocations in the resulting database2 is
about 11 million.
Using the similarity measure proposed in (Lin,
1998), we constructed a corpus-based thesaurus3
consisting of 11839 nouns, 3639 verbs and 5658 ad-
jective/adverbs which occurred in the corpus at least
100 times.

In this section, we use several examples to demon-
strate the basic idea behind our algorithm.
Consider the expression &amp;quot;spill gut&amp;quot;. Using the au-
tomatically constructed thesaurus, we find the fol-
lowing top-10 most similar words to the verb &amp;quot;spill&amp;quot;
and the noun &amp;quot;gut&amp;quot;:
spill: leak 0.153, pour 0.127, spew 0.125, dump
0.118, pump 0.098, seep 0.096, burn 0.095, ex-
plode 0.094, burst 0.092, spray 0.091;

creativity 0.082, heart 0.079, imagination 0.076,
stamina 0.074, soul 0.073, liking 0.073, charisma
0.071;
The collocation &amp;quot;spill gut&amp;quot; occurred 13 times in the
125-million-word corpus. The mutual information
of this collocation is 6.24. Searching the collocation
database, we find that it does not contain any collo-
cation in the form (simv8piii V: compl :N gut) nor
(spill V:compl:N simrigut), where simvsptil is a
verb similar to &amp;quot;spill&amp;quot; and sirnngut is a noun sim-
ilar to &amp;quot;gut&amp;quot;. This means that the phrases, such
as &amp;quot;leak gut&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pour gut&amp;quot;, ... or &amp;quot;spill intestine&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;spill instinct&amp;quot;, either did not appear in the corpus
at all, or did not occur frequent enough to pass the
log-likelihood ratio test.
The second example is &amp;quot;red tape&amp;quot;. The top-10
most similar words to &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tape&amp;quot; in our the-
saurus are:
red: yellow 0.164, purple 0.149, pink 0.146, green
0.136, blue 0.125, white 0.122, color 0.118, or-
ange 0.111, brown 0.101, shade 0.094;
tape: videotape 0.196, cassette 0.177, videocassette

disc 0.113, footage 0.111, recorder 0.106, audio
0.106;
The following table shows the frequency and mutual
information of &amp;quot;red tape&amp;quot; and word combinations
in which one of &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tape&amp;quot; is substituted by a
similar word:

Even though many other similar combinations ex-
ist in the collocation database, they have very differ-
ent frequency counts and mutual information values
than &amp;quot;red tape&amp;quot;.
Finally, consider a compositional phrase: &amp;quot;eco-
nomic impact&amp;quot;. The top-10 most similar words are:
economic: financial 0.305, political 0.243, social
0.219, fiscal 0.209, cultural 0.202, budgetary

nomial distribution can be accurately approximated
by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993). Since
all the potential non-compositional expressions that
we are considering have reasonably large frequency
counts, we assume their distributions are normal.
Let &apos;head type modifierj = k and 1* * *1 = n. The
maximum likelihood estimation of the true proba-
bility p of the collocation (head type modifier) is
= k -n . Even though we do not know what p is, since
p is (assumed to be) normally distributed, there is
N% chance that it fails within the interval

where zN is a constant related to the confidence level
N and the last step in the above derivation is due to
the fact that is very small. Table 3 shows the zN
values for a sample set of confidence intervals.
&amp;quot;economic impact&amp;quot;. In fact, the difference of mu-
tual information values appear to be more impor-
tant to the phrasal similarity than the similarity of
individual words. For example, the phrases &amp;quot;eco-
nomic fallout&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;economic repercussion&amp;quot; are in-
tuitively more similar to &amp;quot;economic impact&amp;quot; than
&amp;quot;economic implication&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;economic significance&amp;quot;,
even though &amp;quot;implication&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;significance&amp;quot; have
higher similarity values to &amp;quot;impact&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;fallout&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;repercussion&amp;quot; do.
These examples suggest that one possible
way to separate compositional phrases and non-
compositional ones is to check the existence and mu-
tual information values of phrases obtained by sub-
stituting one of the words with a similar word. A
phrase is probably non-compositional if such sub-
stitutions are not found in the collocation database
or their mutual information values are significantly
different from that of the phrase.

In order to implement the idea of separating non-
compositional phrases from compositional ones with
mutual information, we must use a criterion to de-
termine whether or not the mutual information val-
ues of two collocations are significantly different. Al-
though one could simply use a predetermined thresh-
old for this purpose, the threshold value will be to-
tally arbitrary. Furthermore, such a threshold does
not take into account the fact that with different fre-
quency counts, we have different levels confidence in
the mutual information values.
We propose a more principled approach. The fre-
quency count of a collocation is a random variable
with binomial distribution. When the frequency
count is reasonably large (e.g., greater than 5), a bi-

We further assume that the estimations of P(A),
P(BIA) and P(CIA) in (2) are accurate. The confi-
dence interval for the true probability gives rise to a
confidence interval for the true mutual information
(mutual information computed using the true proba-
bilities instead of estimations). The upper and lower
bounds of this interval are obtained by substituting
11 with k+zs V-k and L=z11/-1-4. in (2). Since our con-
fidence of p falling between/.1/--V-In. is N%, we can
have N% confidence that the true mutual informa-
tion is within the upper and lower bound.
We use the following condition to determine
whether or not a collocation is compositional:
(3) A collocation a is non-compositional if there
does not exist another collocation /3 such that
(a) 13 is obtained by substituting the head or
the modifier in a with a similar word and (b)
there is an overlap between the 95% confidence
interval of the mutual information values of a
and 0.
For example, the following table shows the fre-
quency count, mutual information (computed with
the most likelihood estimation) and the lower and
upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the
true mutual information:

6 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997878982758621">
There is not yet a well-established methodology
for evaluating automatically acquired lexical knowl-
edge. One possibility is to compare the automati-
cally identified relationships with relationships listed
in a manually compiled dictionary. For example,
(Lin, 1998) compared automatically created the-
saurus with the WordNet (Miller et a).., 1990) and
Roget&apos;s Thesaurus. However, since the lexicon used
in our parser is based on the WordNet, the phrasal
words in WordNet are treated as a single word.
For example, &amp;quot;take advantage of&amp;quot; is treated as a
transitive verb by the parser. As a result, the
extracted non-compositional phrases do not usu-
ally overlap with phrasal entries in the WordNet.
Therefore, we conducted the evaluation by manu-
ally examining sample results. This method was
also used to evaluate automatically identified hy-
ponyms (Hearst, 1998), word similarity (Richardson,
1997), and translations of collocations (Smadja et
al., 1996).
Our evaluation sample consists of 5 most frequent
open class words in the our parsed corpus: {have,
company, make, do, take} and 5 words whose fre-
quencies are ranked from 2000 to 2004: {path, lock,
resort, column, gulf}. We examined three types of
dependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun,
and adjective-noun. A total of 216 collocations were
extracted, shown in Appendix A.
We compared the collocations in Appendix A with
the entries for the above 10 words in the NTC&apos;s
English Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID)
(Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains ap-
proximately 6000 definitions of idioms. For our eval-
uation purposes, we selected the idioms in NTC-EID
that satisfy both of the following two conditions:
(4) a. the head word of the idiom is one of the
above 10 words.
b. there is a verb-object, noun-noun, or
adjective-noun relationship in the idiom
and the modifier in the phrase is not a
variable. For example, &amp;quot;take a stab at
something&amp;quot; is included in the evaluation,
whereas &amp;quot;take something at face value&amp;quot; is
not.
There are 249 such idioms in NTC-EID, 34 of which
are also found in Appendix A (they are marked with
the &apos;+&apos; sign in Appendix A). If we treat the 249 en-
tries in NTC-EID as the gold standard, the precision
and recall of the phrases in Appendix A are shown in
Table 4. To compare the performance with manually
compiled dictionaries, we also compute the precision
and recall of the entries in the Longman Dictionary
of English Idioms (LDOEI) (Long and Summers,
1979) that satisfy the two conditions in (4). It can
be seen that the overlap between manually compiled
dictionaries are quite low, reflecting the fact that dif-
ferent lexicographers may have quite different opin-
ion about which phrases are non-compositional.

The collocations in Appendix A are classified into
three categories. The ones marked with &apos;+&apos; sign
are found in NTC-EID. The ones marked with&apos;x&apos;
are parsing errors (we retrieved from the parsed cor-
pus all the sentences that contain the collocations in
Appendix A and determine which collocations are
parser errors). The unmarked collocations satisfy
the condition (3) but are not found in NTC-EID.
Many of the unmarked collocation are clearly id-
ioms, such as &amp;quot;take (the) Fifth Amendment&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;take (its) toll&amp;quot;, suggesting that even the most com-
prehensive dictionaries may have many gaps in their
coverage. The method proposed in this paper can
be used to improve the coverage manually created
lexical resources.
Most of the parser errors are due to the incom-
pleteness of the lexicon used by the parser. For ex-
ample, &amp;quot;opt&amp;quot; is not listed in the lexicon as a verb.
The lexical analyzer guessed it as a noun, causing
the erroneous collocation &amp;quot;(to) do opt&amp;quot;. The col-
location &amp;quot;trig lock&amp;quot; should be &amp;quot;trigger lock&amp;quot;. The
lexical analyzer in the parser analyzed &amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; as
the -er form of the adjective &amp;quot;trig&amp;quot; (meaning well-
groomed).
Duplications in the corpus can amplify the effect
of a single mistake. For example, the following dis-
claimer occurred 212 times in the corpus.
&amp;quot;Annualized average rate of return after ex-
penses for the past 30 days: not a forecast
of future returns&amp;quot;
The parser analyzed &amp;quot;a forecast of future returns&amp;quot;
as [s [NI:, a forecast of future] [vp returns]]. As a
result, (return V:subj:N forecast) satisfied the
condition (3).
Duplications can also skew the mutual informa-
tion of correct dependency relationships. For ex-
ample, the verb—object relationship between &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;bride&amp;quot; passed the mutual information filter be-
cause there are 4 copies of the article containing this
phrase. If we were able to throw away the duplicates
and record only one count of &amp;quot;take—bride&amp;quot;, it would
have not pass the mutual information filter (3).

The fact that systematic parser errors tend to
pass the mutual information filter is both a curse
and a blessing. On the negative side, there is
no obvious way to separate the parser errors from
true non-compositional expressions. On the positive
side, the output of the mutual information filter has
much higher concentration of parser errors than the
database that contains millions of collocations. By
manually sifting through the output, one can con-
struct a list of frequent parser errors, which can then
be incorporated into the parser so that it can avoid
making these mistakes in the future. Manually go-
ing through the output is not unreasonable, because
each non-compositional expression has to be individ-
ually dealt with in a lexicon anyway.
To find out the benefit of using the dependency
relationships identified by a parser instead of simple
co-occurrence relationships between words, we also
created a database of the co-occurrence relationship
between part-of-speech tagged words. We aggre-
gated all word pairs that occurred within a 4-word
window of each other. The same algorithm and simi-
larity measure for the dependency database are used
to construct a thesaurus using the co-occurrence
database. Appendix B shows all the word pairs that
satisfies the condition (3) and that involve one of
the 10 words {have, company, make, do, take, path,
lock, resort, column, gulf}. It is clear that Appendix
B contains far fewer true non-compositional phrases
than Appendix A.

There have been numerous previous research on ex-
tracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Chouelca,
1988) and (Smadja, 1993). They do not, however,
make a distinction between compositional and non-
compositional collocations. Mutual information has
often been used to separate systematic associations
from accidental ones. It was also used to compute
the distributional similarity between words (Hin-
dle, 1990; Lin, 1998). A method to determine the
compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in
(Tapanainen et al., 1998). The basic idea in there
is that &amp;quot;if an object appears only with one verb (of
few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an
idiomatic nature&amp;quot; (Tapanainen et al., 1998, p.1290).
For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al., 1998)
computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank
the non-compositionality of o according to this value.
Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o)
is computed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.96856725">
n
114. V:compl:N,
DF(o)
i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999620518518518">
where {vi, V2, vn} are verbs in the corpus that
took o as the object and where a and b are constants.
The first column in Table 5 lists the top 40 verb-
object pairs in (Tapanainen et al., 1998). The &amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;
column show the result of our mutual information
filter. The `+&apos; sign means that the verb-object pair
is also consider to be non-compositional according
to mutual information filter (3). The `---&apos; sign means
that the verb-object pair is present in our depen-
dency database, but it does not satisfy condition (3).
For each marked pairs, the &amp;quot;similar collocation&amp;quot;
column provides a similar collocation with a similar
mutual information value (i.e., the reason why the
pair is not consider to be non-compositional). The
`o&apos; marked pairs are not found in our collocation
database for various reasons. For example, &amp;quot;finish
seventh&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot; is normal-
ized as &amp;quot;..NUM&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;have a go&amp;quot; is not found because
&amp;quot;a go&amp;quot; is not an entry in our lexicon, and &amp;quot;take ad-
vantage&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;take advantage of&amp;quot;
is treated as a single lexical item by our parser. The
V marks in the &amp;quot;ntc&amp;quot; column in Table 5 indicate
that the corresponding verb-object pairs is an idiom
in (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993). It can be seen
that none of the verb-object pairs in Table 5 that
are filtered out by condition (3) is listed as an idiom
in NTC-EID.

<bodyText confidence="0.999960888888889">
We have presented a method to identify non-
compositional phrases. The method is based on the
assumption that non-compositional phrases have a
significantly different mutual information value than
the phrases that are similar to their literal mean-
ings. Our experiment shows that this hypothesis is
generally true. However, many collocations resulted
from systematic parser errors also tend to posses this
property.

It is clear that Appendix B contains far fewer true non-compositional phrases than Appendix A. 7 Related Work There have been numerous previous research on extracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Chouelca, 1988) and (Smadja, 1993). They do not, however, make a distinction between compositional and noncompositional collocations. Mutual information has often been used to separate systematic associations from accidental ones. It was also used to compute the distributional similarity between words (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998). A method to determine the compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in (Tapanainen et al., 1998). The basic idea in there is that &amp;quot;if an object appears only with one verb (of few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature&amp;quot; (Tapanainen et al., 1998, p.1290). For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al., 1998) computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank the non-compositionality of o according to this value. Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o) is computed as follows: n 114. V:compl:N, DF(o) i=1 where {vi, V2, vn} are verbs in the cor</context>

In machine translation, word-for-word translation of non-compositional expressions can result in very misleading (sometimes laughable) translations. In information retrieval, expansion of words in a non-compositional expression can lead to dramatic decrease in precision without any gain in recall. Less obviously, non-compositional expressions need to be treated differently than other phrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLP methods. For example, an underlying assumption in some word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li et al., 1995; Lin, 1997), is that if two words occurred in the same context, they are probably similar. Suppose we want to determine the intended meaning of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot product&amp;quot;. We can find other words that are also modified by &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;hot car&amp;quot;) and then choose the meaning of &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; that is most similar to meanings of these words. However, this method fails when non-compositional expressions are involved. For instance, using the same algorithm to determine the meaning of &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;hot line&amp;quot;, the words &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;merchandise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;, etc., would lead the algorithm to choose the &amp;quot;line of p</context>

We present a method for automatic identification of non-compositional expressions using their statistical properties in a text corpus. The intuitive idea behind the method is that the metaphorical usage of a non-compositional expression causes it to have a different distributional characteristic than expressions that are similar to its literal meaning. 2 Input Data The input to our algorithm is a collocation database and a thesaurus. We briefly describe the process of obtaining this input. More details about the construction of the collocation database and the thesaurus can be found in (Lin, 1998). We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus with Minipar,1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993; Lin, 1994), and extracted dependency relationships from the parsed corpus. A dependency relationship is a triple: (head type modifier), where head and modifier are words in the input sentence and type is the type of the dependency relation. For example, (la) is an example dependency tree and the set of dependency triples extracted from (la) are shown in (lb). compl (1) a. orsubj John married Peter&apos;s sister b. (marry V:subj:N John), (marry V:compl:N sister), (sister N:gen:N Peter) There are abou</context>

One possibility is to compare the automatically identified relationships with relationships listed in a manually compiled dictionary. For example, (Lin, 1998) compared automatically created thesaurus with the WordNet (Miller et a).., 1990) and Roget&apos;s Thesaurus. However, since the lexicon used in our parser is based on the WordNet, the phrasal words in WordNet are treated as a single word. For example, &amp;quot;take advantage of&amp;quot; is treated as a transitive verb by the parser. As a result, the extracted non-compositional phrases do not usually overlap with phrasal entries in the WordNet. Therefore, we conducted the evaluation by manually examining sample results. This method was also used to evaluate automatically identified hyponyms (Hearst, 1998), word si</context>

It is clear that Appendix B contains far fewer true non-compositional phrases than Appendix A. 7 Related Work There have been numerous previous research on extracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Chouelca, 1988) and (Smadja, 1993). They do not, however, make a distinction between compositional and noncompositional collocations. Mutual information has often been used to separate systematic associations from accidental ones. It was also used to compute the distributional similarity between words (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998). A method to determine the compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in (Tapanainen et al., 1998). The basic idea in there is that &amp;quot;if an object appears only with one verb (of few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature&amp;quot; (Tapanainen et al., 1998, p.1290). For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al., 1998) computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank the non-compositionality of o according to this value. Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o) is computed as follows: n 114. V:compl:N, DF(o) i=1 where {vi, V2, vn} are verbs in the corpus that too</context>

We examined three types of dependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun, and adjective-noun. A total of 216 collocations were extracted, shown in Appendix A. We compared the collocations in Appendix A with the entries for the above 10 words in the NTC&apos;s English Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID) (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains approximately 6000 definitions of idioms. For our evaluation purposes, we selected the idioms in NTC-EID that satisfy both of the following two conditions: (4) a. the head word of the idiom is one of the above 10 words. b. there is a verb-object, noun-noun, or adjective-noun relationship in the idiom and the modifier in the phrase is not a variable. For example, &amp;quot;take a stab at something&amp;quot; is included in the evaluation, whereas &amp;quot;take something at face value&amp;quot; is not. There are 249 such idioms in NTC-EID, 34 of which are also found in Appendix A (they are marked with the &apos;+&apos; sign</context>

The `o&apos; marked pairs are not found in our collocation database for various reasons. For example, &amp;quot;finish seventh&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot; is normalized as &amp;quot;..NUM&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;have a go&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;a go&amp;quot; is not an entry in our lexicon, and &amp;quot;take advantage&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;take advantage of&amp;quot; is treated as a single lexical item by our parser. The V marks in the &amp;quot;ntc&amp;quot; column in Table 5 indicate that the corresponding verb-object pairs is an idiom in (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993). It can be seen that none of the verb-object pairs in Table 5 that are filtered out by condition (3) is listed as an idiom in NTC-EID. 8 Conclusion We have presented a method to identify noncompositional phrases. The method is based on the assumption that non-compositional phrases have a significantly different mutual information value than the phrases that are similar to their literal meanings. Our experiment shows that this hypothesis is generally true. However, many collocations resulted from systematic parser errors also tend to posses this property.
