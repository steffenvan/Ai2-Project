This volume consists of the descriptions of the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task and the participating
systems. The shared task was dedicated to the detection of uncertainty cues and their linguistic
scope in natural language text. The motivation behind this task was that distinguishing factual
and uncertain information in texts is of essential importance in information extraction.
The shared task addressed the detection of uncertainty in two domains. As uncertainty detection
is extremely important for biomedical information extraction and most existing approaches have
targeted such applications, participants were asked to develop systems for hedge detection in
biological scientific articles. Uncertainty detection is also important, e.g. in encyclopedias,
where the goal is to collect reliable world knowledge about real-world concepts and topics.
Two uncertainty detection tasks, sentence classification and in-sentence hedge scope detection
were given to the participants. A total of 23 teams participated in the shared task. Those who
participated in both tasks were invited to write a paper up to 8 pages. The page limit for those
who participated only in the first task was 6 pages.
Although several approaches were introduced by the participants of the shared task and we
believe that the ideas described in this proceedings can serve as an excellent starting point for
the development of an uncertainty detector, there is a lot of room for improving such systems.
The manually annotated datasets and software tools developed for the shared task may act
as benchmarks for these future experiments and they are freely available at http://www.inf.
