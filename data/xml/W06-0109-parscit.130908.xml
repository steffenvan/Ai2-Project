<bodyText confidence="0.999751052631579">
The role of lexical resources is often un-
derstated in NLP research. The complex-
ity of Chinese, Japanese and Korean
(CJK) poses special challenges to devel-
opers of NLP tools, especially in the area
of word segmentation (WS), information
retrieval (IR), named entity extraction
(NER), and machine translation (MT).
These difficulties are exacerbated by the
lack of comprehensive lexical resources,
especially for proper nouns, and the lack
of a standardized orthography, especially
in Japanese. This paper summarizes some
of the major linguistic issues in the de-
velopment NLP applications that are de-
pendent on lexical resources, and dis-
cusses the central role such resources
should play in enhancing the accuracy of
NLP tools.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.686033">
Developers of CJK NLP tools face various chal-
lenges, some of the major ones being:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995645727272727">
1. Identifying and processing the large number of
orthographic variants in Japanese, and alternate
character forms in CJK languages.
2. The lack of easily available comprehensive
lexical resources, especially lexical databases,
comparable to the major European languages.
3. The accurate conversion between Simplified
and Traditional Chinese (Halpern and Kerman
1999).
4. The morphological complexity of Japanese and
Korean.
5. Accurate word segmentation (Emerson 2000
and Yu et al. 2000) and disambiguating am-
biguous segmentations strings (ASS) (Zhou
and Yu 1994).
6. The difficulty of lexeme-based retrieval and
CJK CLIR (Goto et al. 2001).
7. Chinese and Japanese proper nouns, which are
very numerous, are difficult to detect without a
lexicon.
8. Automatic recognition of terms and their vari-
ants (Jacquemin 2001).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940454545455">
The various attempts to tackle these tasks by
statistical and algorithmic methods (Kwok 1997)
have had only limited success. An important mo-
tivation for such methodology has been the poor
availability and high cost of acquiring and main-
taining large-scale lexical databases.
This paper discusses how a lexicon-driven ap-
proach exploiting large-scale lexical databases
can offer reliable solutions to some of the princi-
pal issues, based on over a decade of experience
in building such databases for NLP applications.

2 Named Entity Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99585852173913">
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is useful in
NLP applications such as question answering,
machine translation and information extraction.
A major difficulty in NER, and a strong motiva-
tion for using tools based on probabilistic meth-
ods, is that the compilation and maintenance of
large entity databases is time consuming and ex-
pensive. The number of personal names and their
variants (e.g. over a hundred ways to spell Mo-
hammed) is probably in the billions. The number
of place names is also large, though they are rela-
tively stable compared with the names of organi-
zations and products, which change frequently.
A small number of organizations, including
The CJK Dictionary Institute (CJKI), maintain
databases of millions of proper nouns, but even
such comprehensive databases cannot be kept
fully up-to-date as countless new names are cre-
ated daily. Various techniques have been used to
automatically detect entities, one being the use of
keywords or syntactic structures that co-occur
with proper nouns, which we refer to as named
entity contextual clues (NECC).

3 Linguistic Issues in Chinese
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999751">
3.1 Processing Multiword Units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998434090909091">
A major issue for Chinese segmentors is how to
treat compound words and multiword lexical
units (MWU), which are often decomposed into
their components rather than treated as single
units. For example, 录像带 lùxiàngdài &apos;video
cassette&apos; and 机器翻译 jīqifānyì &apos;machine trans-
lation&apos; are not tagged as segments in Chinese
Gigaword, the largest tagged Chinese corpus in
existence, processed by the CKIP morphological
analyzer (Ma 2003). Possible reasons for this
include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90777">
1. The lexicons used by Chinese segmentors are
small-scale or incomplete. Our testing of vari-
ous Chinese segmentors has shown that cover-
age of MWUs is often limited.
2. Chinese linguists disagree on the concept of
wordhood in Chinese. Various theories such as
the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis (Huang 1984)
have been proposed. Packard’s outstanding
book (Packard 98) on the subject clears up
much of the confusion.
3. The &amp;quot;correct” segmentation can depend on the
application, and there are various segmenta-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8962975625">
tion standards. For example, a search engine
user looking for 录像带 is not normally inter-
ested in 录像 &apos;to videotape&apos; and 带 &apos;belt&apos; per se,
unless they are part of 录像带.
This last point is important enough to merit
elaboration. A user searching for 中 国 人
zhōngguórén &apos;Chinese (person)&apos; is not interested
in 中国 &apos;China&apos;, and vice-versa. A search for 中
国 should not retrieve 中国人 as an instance of
中国. Exactly the same logic should apply to 机
器翻译, so that a search for that keyword should
only retrieve documents containing that string in
its entirety. Yet performing a Google search on
机器翻译 in normal mode gave some 2.3 mil-
lion hits, hundreds of thousands of which had
zero occurrences of 机器翻译 but numerous
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999267">
65
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.974735912280702">
occurrences of unrelated words like 机器人 &apos;ro-
bot&apos;, which the user is not interested in.
This is equivalent to saying that headwaiter
should not be considered an instance of waiter,
which is indeed how Google behaves. More to
the point, English space-delimited lexemes like
high school are not instances of the adjective
high. As shown in Halpern (2000b), &amp;quot;the degree
of solidity often has nothing to do with the status
of a string as a lexeme. School bus is just as le-
gitimate a lexeme as is headwaiter or word-
processor. The presence or absence of spaces or
hyphens, that is, the orthography, does not de-
termine the lexemic status of a string.&amp;quot;
In a similar manner, it is perfectly legitimate
to consider Chinese MWUs like those shown
below as indivisible units for most applications,
especially information retrieval and machine
translation.
丝绸之路 sachóuzhVir silk road
机器翻译 jaqifanyì machine translation
爱国主义 àiguózhuyì patriotism
录像带 lirxiàngdài video cassette
新西兰 X�nxalán New Zealand
临阵磨枪 línzhènmóqidng
start to prepare at the last moment
One could argue that 机器翻译 is composi-
tional and therefore should be considered &amp;quot;two
words.&amp;quot; Whether we count it as one or two
&amp;quot;words&amp;quot; is not really relevant – what matters is
that it is one lexeme (smallest distinctive units
associating meaning with form). On the other
extreme, it is clear that idiomatic expressions
like 临阵磨枪, literally &amp;quot;sharpen one&apos;s spear be-
fore going to battle,&amp;quot; meaning &apos;start to prepare at
the last moment,’ are indivisible units.
Predicting compositionality is not trivial and
often impossible. For many purposes, the only
practical solution is to consider all lexemes as
indivisible. Nonetheless, currently even the most
advanced segmentors fail to identify such lex-
emes and missegment them into their constitu-
ents, no doubt because they are not registered in
the lexicon. This is an area in which expanded
lexical resources can significantly improve seg-
mentation accuracy.
In conclusion, lexical items like 机器翻译
&apos;machine translation&apos; represent stand-alone, well-
defined concepts and should be treated as single
units. The fact that in English machineless is
spelled solid and machine translation is not is an
historical accident of orthography unrelated to
the fundamental fact that both are full-fledged
lexemes each of which represents an indivisible,
independent concept. The same logic applies to
机器翻译,which is a full-fledged lexeme that
should not be decomposed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99964">
3.2 Multilevel Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91404025">
Chinese MWUs can consist of nested compo-
nents that can be segmented in different ways
for different levels to satisfy the requirements of
different segmentation standards. The example
below shows how � , Běijīng
Rìběnrén Xuéxiào &apos;Beijing School for Japanese
(nationals)&apos; can be segmented on five different
levels.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9988738">
1. 北京日本人学校 multiword lexemic
2. 北京+日本人+学校 lexemic
3. 北京+日本+人+学校 sublexemic
4. 北京 + [日本 + 人] [学+校] morphemic
5. [北+京] [日+本+人] [学+校] submorphemic
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967653954545454">
For some applications, such as MT and NER,
the multiword lexemic level is most appropriate
(the level most commonly used in CJKI’s dic-
tionaries). For others, such as embedded speech
technology where dictionary size matters, the
lexemic level is best. A more advanced and ex-
pensive solution is to store presegmented
MWUs in the lexicon, or even to store nesting
delimiters as shown above, making it possible to
select the desired segmentation level.
The problem of incorrect segmentation is es-
pecially obvious in the case of neologisms. Of
course no lexical database can expect to keep up
with the latest neologisms, and even the first
edition of Chinese Gigaword does not yet have
博客 bókè &apos;blog&apos;. Here are some examples of
MWU neologisms, some of which are not (at
least bilingually), compositional but fully qual-
ify as lexemes.

3.3 Chinese-to-Chinese Conversion (C2C)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799142857143">
Numerous Chinese characters underwent drastic
simplifications in the postwar period. Chinese
written in these simplified forms is called Sim-
plified Chinese (SC). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
most overseas Chinese continue to use the old,
complex forms, referred to as Traditional Chi-
nese (TC). Contrary to popular perception, the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999042285714286">
process of accurately converting SC to/from TC
is full of complexities and pitfalls. The linguistic
issues are discussed in Halpern and Kerman
(1999), while technical issues are described in
Lunde (1999). The conversion can be imple-
mented on three levels in increasing order of
sophistication:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.824232666666667">
1. Code Conversion. The easiest, but most un-
reliable, way to perform C2C is to transcode by
using a one-to-one mapping table. Because of
the numerous one-to-many ambiguities, as
shown below, the rate of conversion failure is
unacceptably high.

</table>
<listItem confidence="0.673106">
2. Orthographic Conversion. The next level of
sophistication is to convert orthographic units,
rather than codepoints. That is, meaningful lin-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971871857142857">
guistic units, equivalent to lexemes, with the
important difference that the TC is the tradi-
tional version of the SC on a character form
level. While code conversion is ambiguous, or-
thographic conversion gives much better results
because the orthographic mapping tables enable
conversion on the lexeme level, as shown below.
</bodyText>

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.86751">
As can be seen, the ambiguities inherent in
code conversion are resolved by using ortho-
graphic mapping tables, which avoids false con-
versions such as shown in the Incorrect column.
Because of segmentation ambiguities, such con-
version must be done with a segmentor that can
break the text stream into meaningful units (Em-
erson 2000).
An extra complication, among various others,
is that some lexemes have one-to-many ortho-
graphic mappings, all of which are correct. For
example, SC 阴干 correctly maps to both TC 陰
乾 &apos;dry in the shade&apos; and TC 陰干 &apos;the five even
numbers&apos;. Well designed orthographic mapping
tables must take such anomalies into account.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.815642769230769">
3. Lexemic Conversion. The most sophisti-
cated form of C2C conversion is called lexemic
conversion, which maps SC and TC lexemes
that are semantically, not orthographically,
equivalent. For example, SC 信息 xìnxī &apos;infor-
mation&apos; is converted into the semantically
equivalent TC 資訊 zīxùn. This is similar to the
difference between British pavement and
American sidewalk. Tsou (2000) has demon-
strated that there are numerous lexemic differ-
ences between SC and TC, especially in techni-
cal terms and proper nouns, e.g. there are more
than 10 variants for Osama bin Laden.

3.4 Traditional Chinese Variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998215928571429">
Traditional Chinese has numerous variant char-
acter forms, leading to much confusion. Disam-
biguating these variants can be done by using
mapping tables such as the one shown below. If
such a table is carefully constructed by limiting
it to cases of 100% semantic interchangeability
for polysemes, it is easy to normalize a TC text
by trivially replacing variants by their standard-
ized forms. For this to work, all relevant compo-
nents, such as MT dictionaries, search engine
indexes and the related documents should be
normalized. An extra complication is that Tai-
wanese and Hong Kong variants are sometimes
different (Tsou 2000).

4 Orthographic Variation in Japanese
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980142">
4.1 Highly Irregular Orthography
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999161">
The Japanese orthography is highly irregular,
significantly more so than any other major lan-
guage, including Chinese. A major factor is the
complex interaction of the four scripts used to
write Japanese, e.g. kanji, hiragana, katakana,
and the Latin alphabet, resulting in countless
words that can be written in a variety of often
unpredictable ways, and the lack of a standard-
ized orthography. For example, toriatsukai &apos;han-
dling&apos; can be written in six ways: 取り扱い, 取
扱い, 取扱, とり扱い, 取りあつかい, とり
あつかい.
An example of how difficult Japanese IR can
be is the proverbial &apos;A hen that lays golden eggs.&apos;
The &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; orthography would be 金の卵を
産む鶏 Kin no tamago o umu niwatori. In real-
ity, tamago &apos;egg&apos; has four variants (卵, 玉子, た
まご, タマゴ), niwatori &apos;chicken&apos; three (鶏, に
わとり, ニワトリ) and umu &apos;to lay&apos; two (産む,
生む), which expands to 24 permutations like 金
の卵を生むニワトリ, 金の玉子を産む鶏 etc.
As can be easily verified by searching the web,
these variants occur frequently.
Linguistic tools that perform segmentation,
MT, entity extraction and the like must identify
and/or normalize such variants to perform dic-
tionary lookup. Below is a brief discussion of
what kind of variation occurs and how such
normalization can be achieved.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974607">
4.2 Okurigana Variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999632">
One of the most common types of orthographic
variation in Japanese occurs in kana endings,
called okurigana, that are attached to a kanji
stem. For example, okonau &apos;perform&apos; can be
written 行う or 行なう, whereas toriatsukai can
be written in the six ways shown above. Okuri-
gana variants are numerous and unpredictable.
Identifying them must play a major role in Japa-
nese orthographic normalization. Although it is
possible to create a dictionary of okurigana vari-
ants algorithmically, the resulting lexicon would
be huge and may create numerous false positives
not semantically interchangeable. The most ef-
fective solution is to use a lexicon of okurigana
variants, such as the one shown below:

<bodyText confidence="0.987600285714286">
Since Japanese is highly agglutinative and
verbs can have numerous inflected forms, a lexi-
con such as the above must be used in conjunc-
tion with a morphological analyzer that can do
accurate stemming, i.e. be capable of recogniz-
ing that 書き著しませんでした is the polite
form of the canonical form 書き著す .

4.3 Cross-Script Orthographic Variation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987544">
Variation across the four scripts in Japanese is
common and unpredictable, so that the same
word can be written in any of several scripts, or
even as a hybrid of multiple scripts, as shown
below:

Cross-script variation can have major conse-
quences for recall, as can be seen from the table

Using the ID above to represent the number of
Google hits, this gives a total of A+B+C+α123
= 191,700. α is a coincidental occurrence factor,
such as in &apos;100 人参加, in which &apos;人参&apos; is unre-
lated to the &apos;carrot&apos; sense. The formulae for cal-
culating the above are as follows.

人参 &apos;carrot&apos; illustrates how serious a problem
cross-orthographic variants can be. If ortho-
graphic normalization is not implemented to en-
sure that all variants are indexed on a standard-
ized form like 人参, recall is only 30%; if it is,
there is a dramatic improvement and recall goes
up to nearly 100%, without any loss in precision,
which hovers at 100%.

4.4 Kana Variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870555555555">
A sharp increase in the use of katakana in re-
cent years is a major annoyance to NLP applica-
tions because katakana orthography is often ir-
regular; it is quite common for the same word to
be written in multiple, unpredictable ways. Al-
though hiragana orthography is generally regular,
a small number of irregularities persist. Some of
the major types of kana variation are shown in
the table below.

The above is only a brief introduction to the

4.5 Miscellaneous Variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981714285714">
There are various other types of orthographic
variants in Japanese, described in Halpern
(2000a). To mention some, kanji even in con-
temporary Japanese sometimes have variants,
such as t for � and � for IFq, and traditional
forms such as � for �. In addition, many kun
homophones and their variable orthography are
often close or even identical in meaning, i.e.,
noboru means &apos;go up&apos; when written 上る but
&apos;climb&apos; when written 登る, so that great care
must be taken in the normalization process so as
to assure semantic interchangeability for all
senses of polysemes; that is, to ensure that such
forms are excluded from the normalization table.

5 Orthographic Variation in Korean
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943172413793">
Modern Korean has is a significant amount of
orthographic variation, though far less than in
Japanese. Combined with the morphological
complexity of the language, this poses various
challenges to developers of NLP tools. The is-
sues are similar to Japanese in principle but dif-
fer in detail.
Briefly, Korean has variant hangul spellings
in the writing of loanwords, such as 케이크
keikeu and 케잌 keik for &apos;cake&apos;, and in the writ-
ing of non-Korean personal names, such as
클린턴 keulrinteon and 클린톤 keulrinton for
&apos;Clinton&apos;. In addition, similar to Japanese but on
a smaller scale, Korean is written in a mixture of
hangul, Chinese characters and the Latin alpha-
bet. For example, &apos;shirt&apos; can be written 와이셔츠
wai-syeacheu or Y 셔츠 wai-syeacheu, whereas
&apos;one o&apos;clock&apos; hanzi can written as 한시, 1 시 or
一時. Another issue is the differences between
South and North Korea spellings, such as N.K.
오사까 osakka vs. S.K. 오사카 osaka for
&apos;Osaka&apos;, and the old (pre-1988) orthography ver-
sus the new, i.e. modern 일군 &apos;worker&apos; (ilgun)
used to be written 일꾼 (ilkkun).
Lexical databases, such as normalization ta-
bles similar to the ones shown above for Japa-
nese, are the only practical solution to identify-
ing such variants, as they are in principle unpre-
dictable.

6 The Role of Lexical Databases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991476190476">
Because of the irregular orthography of CJK
languages, procedures such as orthographic
normalization cannot be based on statistical and
probabilistic methods (e.g. bigramming) alone,
not to speak of pure algorithmic methods. Many
attempts have been made along these lines, as
for example Brill (2001) and Goto et al. (2001),
with some claiming performance equivalent to
lexicon-driven methods, while Kwok (1997)
reports good results with only a small lexicon
and simple segmentor.
Emerson (2000) and others have reported that
a robust morphological analyzer capable of
processing lexemes, rather than bigrams or n-
grams, must be supported by a large-scale com-
putational lexicon. This experience is shared by
many of the world&apos;s major portals and MT de-
velopers, who make extensive use of lexical da-
tabases.
Unlike in the past, disk storage is no longer a
major issue. Many researchers and developers,
such as Prof. Franz Guenthner of the University
of Munich, have come to realize that “language
is in the data,” and “the data is in the diction-
ary,” even to the point of compiling full-form
dictionaries with millions of entries rather than
rely on statistical methods, such as Meaningful
Machines who use a full form dictionary con-
taining millions of entries in developing a hu-
man quality Spanish-to-English MT system.
CJKI, which specializes in CJK and Arabic
computational lexicography, is engaged in an
ongoing research and development effort to
compile CJK and Arabic lexical databases (cur-
rently about seven million entries), with special
emphasis on proper nouns, orthographic nor-
malization, and C2C. These resources are being
subjected to heavy industrial use under real-
world conditions, and the feedback thereof is
being used to further expand these databases and
to enhance the effectiveness of the NLP tools
based on them.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791352941177">
Performing such tasks as orthographic normali-
zation and named entity extraction accurately is
beyond the ability of statistical methods alone,
not to speak of C2C conversion and morpho-
logical analysis. However, the small-scale lexi-
cal resources currently used by many NLP tools
are inadequate to these tasks. Because of the ir-
regular orthography of the CJK writing systems,
lexical databases fine-tuned to the needs of NLP
applications are required. The building of
large-scale lexicons based on corpora consisting
of even billions of words has come of age. Since
lexicon-driven techniques have proven their ef-
fectiveness, there is no need to overly rely on
probabilistic methods. Comprehensive, up-to-
date lexical resources are the key to achieving
major enhancements in NLP technology.

Table 4. Orthographic Conversion English SC TC1 TC2 Incorrect Telephone 电话 電話 Dry 干燥 乾燥 干燥 幹燥 榦燥 阴干 陰乾 陰干 As can be seen, the ambiguities inherent in code conversion are resolved by using orthographic mapping tables, which avoids false conversions such as shown in the Incorrect column. Because of segmentation ambiguities, such conversion must be done with a segmentor that can break the text stream into meaningful units (Emerson 2000). An extra complication, among various others, is that some lexemes have one-to-many orthographic mappings, all of which are correct. For example, SC 阴干 correctly maps to both TC 陰 乾 &apos;dry in the shade&apos; and TC 陰干 &apos;the five even numbers&apos;. Well designed orthographic mapping tables must take such anomalies into account. 3. Lexemic Conversion. The most sophisticated form of C2C conversion is called lexemic conversion, which maps SC and TC lexemes that are semantically, not orthographically, equivalent. For example, SC 信息 xìnxī &apos;information&apos; is converted into the semantically equivalent TC 資訊 zīxùn.</context>

Possible reasons for this include: 1. The lexicons used by Chinese segmentors are small-scale or incomplete. Our testing of various Chinese segmentors has shown that coverage of MWUs is often limited. 2. Chinese linguists disagree on the concept of wordhood in Chinese. Various theories such as the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis (Huang 1984) have been proposed. Packard’s outstanding book (Packard 98) on the subject clears up much of the confusion. 3. The &amp;quot;correct” segmentation can depend on the application, and there are various segmentation standards. For example, a search engine user looking for 录像带 is not normally interested in 录像 &apos;to videotape&apos; and 带 &apos;belt&apos; per se, unless they are part of 录像带. This last point is important enough to merit elaboration. A user searching for 中 国 人 zhōngguórén &apos;Chinese (person)&apos; is not interested in 中国 &apos;China&apos;, and vice-versa.

Chinese written in these simplified forms is called Simplified Chinese (SC). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most overseas Chinese continue to use the old, complex forms, referred to as Traditional Chinese (TC). Contrary to popular perception, the 66 process of accurately converting SC to/from TC is full of complexities and pitfalls. The linguistic issues are discussed in Halpern and Kerman (1999), while technical issues are described in Lunde (1999). The conversion can be implemented on three levels in increasing order of sophistication: 1. Code Conversion. The easiest, but most unreliable, way to perform C2C is to transcode by using a one-to-one mapping table. Because of the numerous one-to-many ambiguities, as shown below, the rate of conversion failure is unacceptably high. Table 3.

Yet performing a Google search on 机器翻译 in normal mode gave some 2.3 million hits, hundreds of thousands of which had zero occurrences of 机器翻译 but numerous 65 occurrences of unrelated words like 机器人 &apos;robot&apos;, which the user is not interested in. This is equivalent to saying that headwaiter should not be considered an instance of waiter, which is indeed how Google behaves. More to the point, English space-delimited lexemes like high school are not instances of the adjective high. As shown in Halpern (2000b), &amp;quot;the degree of solidity often has nothing to do with the status of a string as a lexeme. School bus is just as legitimate a lexeme as is headwaiter or wordprocessor. The presence or absence of spaces or hyphens, that is, the orthography, does not determine the lexemic status of a string.&amp;quot; In a similar manner, it is perfectly legitimate to consider Chinese MWUs like those shown below as indivisible units for most applications, especially information retrieval and machine translation. 丝绸之路 sachóuzhVir silk road 机器翻译 jaqifanyì machine translation 爱国主义 àiguózhuyì patriotism 录像带 lirxiàngdài vid</context>

This paper discusses how a lexicon-driven approach exploiting large-scale lexical databases can offer reliable solutions to some of the principal issues, based on over a decade of experience in building such databases for NLP applications. 2 Named Entity Extraction Named Entity Recognition (NER) is useful in NLP applications such as question answering, machine translation and information extraction.

Many attempts have been made along these lines, as for example Brill (2001) and Goto et al. (2001), with some claiming performance equivalent to lexicon-driven methods, while Kwok (1997) reports good results with only a small lexicon and simple segmentor. Emerson (2000) and others have reported that a robust morphological analyzer capable of processing lexemes, rather than bigrams or ngrams, must be supported by a large-scale computational lexicon. This experience is shared by many of the world&apos;s major portals and MT developers, who make extensive use of lexical databases. Unlike in the past, disk storage is no longer a major issue. Many researchers and developers, such as Prof. Franz Guenthner of the University of Munich, have come to realize that “language is in the data,” </context>

Chinese written in these simplified forms is called Simplified Chinese (SC). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most overseas Chinese continue to use the old, complex forms, referred to as Traditional Chinese (TC). Contrary to popular perception, the 66 process of accurately converting SC to/from TC is full of complexities and pitfalls. The linguistic issues are discussed in Halpern and Kerman (1999), while technical issues are described in Lunde (1999). The conversion can be implemented on three levels in increasing order of sophistication: 1. Code Conversion. The easiest, but most unreliable, way to perform C2C is to transcode by using a one-to-one mapping table. Because of the numerous one-to-many ambiguities, as shown below, the rate of conversion failure is unacceptably high. Table 3.
