<bodyText confidence="0.976422">
Intersentential elliptical utterances occur
frequently in information-seeking dialogues. This
paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for
interpreting such utterances, including identifi-
cation of the speaker&apos;a discourse pal in employ-
ing the fragment. We claim that the advantage of
this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic
information, including discourse content and
conversational goals, rather than upon precise
representations of the preceding utterance alone.

The fragmentary utterances that are common in
communication between humans also occur in man-
machine communication. Humans persist in using
abbreviated statements and queries, even in the
presence of explicit and repeated instructions to
adhere to syntactically and semantically complete
sentences (Carbonell, 1983). Thus a robust
natural language interface must handle ellipsis.
We have studied one class of elliptical
utterances, intersentential fragments, in the con-
text of an information-seeking dialogue. As noted
by Allen(1980), such utterances differ from other
forms of ellipsis in that interpretation often
depends more heavily upon the speaker&apos;s inferred
underlying task-related plan than upon preceding
syntactic forms. For example, the following
elliptical fragment can only be interpreted within
the context of the speaker&apos;a goal as communicated
in the first utterance:
[Eli] &amp;quot;I want to cash this check.
Small bills only.&amp;quot;
Furthermore, intersentential fragments are often
employed to communicate discourse goals, such as
expressing doubt, which a syntactically complete
form of the same utterance may not convey as
effectively. In the following alternative
responses to the initial statement by SPEAKER-1,
Fl expresses doubt regarding the proposition
stated by SPEAKER-1 whereas F2 merely asks about
the jet&apos;s contents.

Previous research on ellipsis has neglected to
address the speaker&apos;s discourse goals in employing
the fragment but real understanding requires that
these be identified (Mann, Moore, and Levin, 1977)
(Webber, Pollack, and Hirschberg, 1982).
In this paper, we investigate a framework for
interpreting intersentential ellipsis that occurs
in task-oriented dialogues. This framework
includes:
[1] a context mechanism (Carberry, 1983) that
builds the information-seeker&apos;s underlying
plan as the dialogue progresses and differen-
tiates between local and global contexts.
[2] a discourse component that controls the
interpretation of ellipsis based upon
discourse goal expectations gleaned from the
dialogue; this component &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot;
ellipsis by identifying Uhe&apos; discourse goal
which the speaker is pursuing by employing
the elliptical fragment, and by determining
how the fragnent should be interpreted rela-
tive to that goal.
[3] an analysis component that suggests possible
associations of an elliptical fragment with
aspects of the inferred plan for the
information-seeker.
[4] an evaluation component which, given multiple
possible associations of an elliptical frag-
ment with aspects of the information-seeker&apos;s
underlying plan, selects that association
most appropriate to the discourse context and
believed to be intended by the speaker.

INTERPRETATION OF INTERSENTENTIAL ELLIPSIS

elliptical fragments cannot be fully understood in
and of themselves. Therefore a strategy for

form of preceding utterances, the semantic
representation of preceding utterances, and expec-
tations gleaned from understanding the preceding
discourse.
The first two strateglea are exemplified by
the work of Carbonell and Hayes(1983), Hendrix,
Sacerdoti, and Slocum(1976), Waltz(1978), and
Weischedel and Sondheimer(1982). Several limita-
tions esiet in these approaches, including an ina-
bility to handle utterances that rely upon an
assumed communication of the underlying task and
difficulty in resolving ambiguity among multiple
interpretations. Consider the following two
dialogue sequences:
SPEAKER: &amp;quot;I want to take a bus.
The cost?&amp;quot;
SPEAKER: &amp;quot;I want to purchase a bus.
The oast?&amp;quot;
If a semantic strategy is employed, the case frame
representation for &amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; may have a &amp;quot;cost of bus&amp;quot;
and a &amp;quot;cost of bus ticket&amp;quot; slot; ambiguity arises
regarding to which slot the elliptical fragment
&amp;quot;The cost?&amp;quot; refers. Although 000 might suggest
extensions for handling this fragment, a semantic
strategy alone does not provide an adequate frame-
work for interpreting intersentential ellipsis.
The third potential strategy utilizes a model
of the information-seeker&apos;s inferred task-related
plan and discourse goals. The power of this
approach is its reliance upon pragmatic informa-
tion, including discourse content and converaa-
tional goals, rather than upon precise representa-
tions of the preceding utterances alone.
Allen(1980) was the first to relate ellipsis
processing to the domain-dependent plan underlying
a speaker&apos;s utterance. Allen views the speaker&apos;s
utterance as part of a plan which the speaker has
constructed and is executing to accomplish his
overall task-related goals. To interpret ellipti-
cal fragments, Allen first constructs a set of
possible surface speech act representations for
the elliptical fragment, limited by syntactic
clues appearing within the fragment. The task-
related goals which the speaker might pursue form
a sat of expectations, and Allen attempts to infer
the speaker&apos;s goal-related plan which resulted in
execution of the observed utterance. A part of
this inference process involves determining which
of the partially constructed plans connecting
expectations (goals) and observed utterance are
&apos;reasonable given the knowledge and mutual beliefs
of the speaker and hearer. Allen selects the sur-
face speech act which produced the most reasonable
inferred plan as the correct interpretation.
Allen notes that the speaker&apos;s fragment must
identify the aubgoals which the speaker is pursu-
ing, but claims that in very restricted domains,
identifying the speaker&apos;s overall goal from the
utterance Is sufficient to identify the appropri-
ate response in terms of the obstacles present in
such a plan. For his restricted domain involving
train arrivals and departures, Allen&apos;s interpreta-
tion strategy works well. In more complex
domains, it is necessary to identify the particu-
lar aspect of the speaker&apos;s overall task-related
plan addressed by the elliptical fragment in order
to interpret it properly. More recently, Litman
and Allen(1984) have extended Allen&apos;s model to a
hierarchy of task-plans and meta-plans. Lidaan is
currently studying the interpretation of ellipti-
cal fragments within this enhanced framework.
In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and
plan-based strategies, a few other heuristics have
been utilized. Carbonell(1983) U3S3 discourse
expectation rules that suggest a set of expected
user utterances and relate elliptical fragments to
these expected patterns. For example, if the sys-
tem asks the user whether a particular value
should be used as the filler of a slot in a.case
frame, the system then expects the user&apos;s utter-
ance to contain a confirmation or diaconfirmation
pattern, a different filler for the slot, a com-
parative pattern such as &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot;, and so forth.
Although these rules use expectations about how
the speaker might respond, they seem to have lit-
tle to do with the expected discourse goals of the
speaker.
Real understanding consists not only of
recognizing the particular surface-request or
surface-inform, but also of inferring what the
speaker wants to accomplish and the relationship
of each utterance to this task. Interpretation of
ellipsis based upon the speaker&apos;s inferred under-
lying task-related plan and discourse goals facil-
itates a richer interpretation of elliptical
utterances.

REQUISITE KRCWLEDGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981066666667">
A speaker can felicitously employ intersen-
tential ellipsis only if he believes his utterance
will be properly understood. The motivation for
this work is the hypothesis that speaker and
hearer mutually believe that certain knowledge has
been aoquired during the course of the dialogue
and that this factual knowledge along with other
processing knowledge will be used to deduce the
speaker&apos;s intentions. We claim that the requisite
factual knowledge includes the speaker&apos;s inferred
task-related plan, the speaker&apos;s inferred beliefs,
and the anticipated discourse goals of the
speaker; We claim that the requisite processing
knowledge includes plan recognition strategies and
focusing techniques.

1. Task-Related Plan
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999184363636364">
In a cooperative information-seeking dialo-
gue, the information-provider is expected to infer
the information-seeker&apos;s underlying task-related
plan as the dialogue progresses. At any point in
the dialogue, IS (the information-seeker) believes
that some subset of this plan has been communi-
cated to IP (the information-provider); therefore
IS feels justified in formulating utterances under
the assumption that IP will use this inferred task
model to interpret utterances, including ellipti-
cal fragsenta.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998394">

<bodyText confidence="0.997802227272727">
An example will illustrate the importance of
IS&apos;a inferred task-related plan in interpreting
ellipsis. In the following, IS in considering
purchase of a home mentioned earlier in the dialo-
gue:
LS: &amp;quot;What elementary school do children
in Rolling Hills attend?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;They attend Castle Elementary.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Any nearby swim clubs?&amp;quot;
An informal poll indicates that most people inter-
pret the last utterance as a request for swim
clubs near the property under consideration in
Rolling Hills and that the reason for such an
interpretation is their inference that IS is
investigating recreational facilities that might
be used if IS were to purchase the home. However,
if we substitute the fragment
&amp;quot;Any nearby day-care centers?&amp;quot;
for the last utterance in the dialogue, then
interpretation depends upon whether one believes
IS wants his/her children to be bused, or perhaps
even walk, to day-care directly from school.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.962096" genericHeader="method">
2. Shared Beliefs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997255145833333">
Shared beliefs of facts, beliefs which the
listener believes speaker and listener mutually
hold, are a second component of factual knowledge
required for processing intersentential elliptical
fragments. These shared beliefs either represent
presumed a priori knowledge of the domain, such as
a presumption that dialogue participants in a
university domain know that each course has a&apos;
teacher, or beliefs derived from the dialogue
itself. An example of the latter occurs if IP
tells IS that CS360 is a 5 credit hour course; IS
may not himself believe that CS360 is a 5 credit
hour course, but as a result of IP&apos;s utterance, he
does believe it is mutually believed that IP
believes this.
Understanding utterances requires that we
identify the speaker&apos;s discourse goal in making
the utterance. Shared beliefs, often called
mutual beliefs, form a part of communicated
knowledge used to interpret utterances and iden-
tify discourse goals in a cooperative dialogue.
The following example illustrates how IP&apos;s beliefs
about IS influence understanding.
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS400?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown is teaching CS400.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot;
The fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; is a request
to know whether CS400 is meeting at night. How-
ever, if one precedes the above utterances with a
query whose response informs IS that CS400 meets
only at night, then the last utterance,
&amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot;
becomes an objection and request for corroboration
or explanation. The reason for this difference in
interpretation is the difference in beliefs
regarding IS at the time the elliptical fragment
is uttered. In the latter case, IP believes it is
mutually believed that IS already knows IP&apos;s
beliefs regarding when CS400 meets, so a request
for that information is not felicitous and a dif-
ferent intention or discourse goal in attributed
to IS.
Allen and Perrault(1980) used mutual beliefs
in their work on indirect speech acts and sug-
gested their use in clarification and correction
dialogues. Sidner(1983) models user beliefs about
system capabilities in her work on recognizing
speaker intention in utterances.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.897743" genericHeader="method">
3. Anticipated Discourse Goals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981385">
The speaker&apos;s anticipated discourse goals
form a third component of factual knowledge
required for processing elliptical fragments. The
dialogue preceding an elliptical utterance may
suggest discourse goals for the speaker; these
suggested discourse goals become shared knowledge
between speaker and hearer. As a result, the
listener is On WI lookout for the speaker to pur-
sue these anticipated discourse goals and inter-
prets utterances accordingly.
Consider for example the following dialogue:
IP: &amp;quot;Have you taken CS105 or C3170?&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;At the University of Delaware?&amp;quot;
IP: *No, anywhere.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Yes, at Penn State.&amp;quot;
In this example, IP&apos;s initial query produces a
strong anticipation that IS will pursue the
discourse goal of providing the requested informa-
tion. Therefore subsequent utterances are inter-
preted with the expectation that IS will eventu-
ally address this goal. IS&apos;s first utterance is
interpreted as pursuing a discourse goal of seek-
ing clarification of the question posed by IP;
IS&apos;s last utterance answers the initial query
posed by IP. However discourse expectations do
not persist forever with intervening utterances.

4. Processing Knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998358125">
Plan-recognition strategies and focusing
techniques are necessary components of processing
knowledge for interpreting intersentential
ellipsis. Plan-recognition strategies are essen-
tial in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s
underlying task-related plan and focusing tech-
niques are necessary in order to identify that
portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmen-
tary utterance refers.
Focusing aechaniams have been employed by
Grosz(1977) in identifying the referents of defin-
ite noun phrases, by Robinson(1981) in interpret-
ing verb phrases, by Sidner(1981) in anaphora
resolution, by Carberry(1983) in plan inference,
and by McKeown( 1982) in natural language genera-
tion.

FRAMEWORK FOR PROCESSING ELLIPSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719103448276">
If an utterance is parsed as a sentence frag-
ment, ellipsis processing begins. A model of any
preceding dialogue contains a context tree (Car-
berry, 1983) corresponding to IS&apos;s inferred under-
lying task-related plan, a space containing IS&apos;s
anticipated discourse goals, and a belief model
representing IS&apos;s inferred beliefs.
Our framework is a top-down strategy which
uses the information-seeker&apos;s anticipated
discourse goals to guide interpretation of the
fragment and relate it to the underlying task-
related plan. The discourse component first
analyzes the top. element of the discourse stack
and suggests potential discourse goals which IS
might be expected to pursue. The plan analysis
component uses the context tree and the belief
model to suggest possible associations of the
elliptical fragment with aspects of IS&apos;s inferred
task-related plan. If multiple associations are
suggested, the evaluation component applies
focusing strategies to select the interpretation
believed intended by the speaker --- namely, that
most appropriate to the current focus of attention
ir. the dialogue. The discourse component then
uses the results produced by the analysis com-
ponent to determine if the fragment accomplishes
the proposed discourse goal; if so, it interprets
the fragment relevant to the identified discourse
goal.

FLAN-ANALYSIS COMPONENT
1. Association of Fragments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999541904761905">
The plan-analysis component is responsible
for associating an elliptical fragment with a term
or conjunction of propositions in IS&apos;s underlying
task-related plan. The analysis component deter-
mines, based upon the .current focus of attention,
the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by
IS&apos; s fragment and the discourse goal rules infer
hcw IS intends the fragment to be interpreted.
This paper will discuss three classes of ellipti-
cal fragments; a description of how other frag-
ments are associated with plan elements is pro-
vided in (Carberry, 1985).
A constant fragment can only associate with
terms whose semantic type is the same or a super-
set of the semantic type of the constant. Further-
more, each term has a limited set of valid instan-
tiations within the existing plan. A constant
associates with a term only if IP&apos; s beliefs indi-
cate that IS might believe that the uttered con-
stant is one of the term&apos;s valid instantiations.
For example, if a plan contains the proposition
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.615855333333333">
S tarting-Da te ( AI-CON F JAN15)
the elliptical fragment
&amp;quot;February 2?&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.926520490196079">
will associate with this proposition only if IP
believes IS might believe that the starting date
for the AI conference is in February.
Recourse to such a belief model is necessary
in order to allow for Yes-No questions to which
the answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; and yet eliminate potential
associations which a human listener would recog-
nize as unlikely. Although this discarding of
possible associations does not occur often in
interpreting elliptical fragments, actual human
dialogues indicate that it is a real phenomenon.
(Sidner(1981) employs a similar strategy in her
work on anaphora resolution. A co-specifier pro-
posed by the focusing rules must be confirmed by
an inference machine; if any contradications are
detected, other co-specifiers are suggested.)
A propositional fragment can be of two types.
The first contains a proposition whose name is the
same as the name of a proposition in the plan
domain. The second type is a more general propo-
sitional fragment which cannot be associated with
a specific plan-based proposition until after
analyzing the relevant propositions appearing in
IS&apos;s plan. The semantic representations of the•
utterances
&amp;quot;Taught by Dr. Smith?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;With Dr. Smith?&amp;quot;
would produce respectively the type 1 and type 2
propositions
Teaches (_ss : &amp;SECT IONS, SMITH)
Genpred(SMITH)
The latter indicates that the name of the specific
plan proposition is as yet unknown but that one of
its parameters must associate with the constant
Smith.
A proposition of the first type associates
with a proposition of the same name if the parame-
ters of the propositions associate. A proposition
of the second type associates with any proposition
whose parameters include terms associating with
the known parameters of the propositional frag-
ment.
The semantic representation of a term such as
&amp;quot;The meeting time?&amp;quot;
is a variable term
_tme:&amp;MTG-TMES
Such a term associates with terms of the same
semantic type in IS&apos;s plan. Note that the exist-
ing plan may contain constant instantiations in
place of former variables. A term fragment still
associates with such constant terms.

PLTERM representing that aspect of the

in IS&apos;s fragment for the terms with which they are
associated in IS&apos;s plan.

<bodyText confidence="0.999080155555556">
It appears that humans retain as much of the
established context as possible in interpreting
intersentential ellipsis. Carbonell(1983) demon-
strated this phemonenon in an informal poll in
which users were found to interpret the fragment
in the following dialogue as retaining the fixed
media specification:
&amp;quot;What is the size. of the 3 largest
single port fixed media disks?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;disks with two parts?&amp;quot;
We have noted the same phenomenon in a student
advisement domain.
Thus when an elliptical fragment associates
with a portion of the task-related plan or an
expansion of one of its actions, the context esta-
blished by the preceding dialogue must be used to
replace information deleted from this streamlined,
fragmentary utterance. The set of ACTIVE nodes in
the context model form a stack of plans, the top-
most of which is the current focused plan; each
of these plans is the expansion of an action
appearing in the plan immediately beneath it in
this stack. These ACTIVE nodes represent the
established global context within which the frag-
mentary utterance occurs, and the propositions
appearing along this path contain information
missing from the sentence fragment but presumed
understood by the speaker.
TS the elliptical fragment is a proposition,
the analysis component produces a conjunction of
propositions SPREDS representing that aspect of
the plan highlighted by IS&apos;s elliptical fragment.
If the elliptical fragment is a constant, term, or
term with attached propositions, the analysis com-
ponent produces a term STERM associated with the
constant or term in the fragment as well as a con-
junction of propositions SPREDS. SPREDS consists
of all propositions along the paths from the root
of the context tree to the nodes at which an ele-
ment of the fragment is associated with a plan
element, as well as all propositions appearing
along the previous ACTIVE path. The former
represent the new context derived from IS&apos;s frag-
mentary utterance whereas the latter retain the
previously established global context.

EVALUATION COMPONENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972644">
The analysis component proposes a set of
potential associations of the elliptical fragment
with elements of IS&apos;s underlying task-related
plan. The evaluation component employs focusing
strategies to select what it believes to be the
interpretation intended by IS --- namely, that
interpretation most relevant to the current focus
of attention in the dialogue.
We employ the notion of focus domains in
order to group finely grained actions and associ-
ated plans into more general related structures.
A focus domain consists of a set of actions, one
of which is an ancestor of all other actions in
the focus domain and is called the root of the
focus domain. If an action is a member of a focus
domain and that action is not the root action of
another focus domain, then all the actions 030-
tained in the plan associated with the first
action are also members of the focus domain.
(This is similar to Grosz&apos;s focus spaces and the
notion of an object being in implicit focus.)
The use of focus domains allows the grouping
together of those actions that appear to be at
approximately the same level of implicit focus
when a plan is explicitly focused. For example,
the actions of learning from a particular teacher,
learning the material in a given text, and attend-
ing class will all reside at the same focus level
within the expanded plan for earning credit in a
course. The action of going to the cashier&apos;s
office to pay one&apos;s tuition also appears within
this expanded plan; however it will reside at a
different focus level since it does not come to
mind nearly so readily when one thinks about tak-
ing a course.
The following are two of seven focusing rules
used to select the association deemed most
relevant to the existing plan context.
[F1] Within the current focus space, prefer asso-
ciations which occur within the current
focused plan.
[F2] Within the current focus space and current
focused plan, prefer associations within the
actions to achieve the most recently con-
sidered action.

ANTICIPATED DISCOURSE GOALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998220875">
When IS makes an utterance, he is attempting
to accomplish a discourse goal; this discourse
goal may in turn predict other subsequent
discourse goals for IS. For example, if IS asks a
question, one anticipates that IS may want to
expand upon his question. Similarly, utterances
made by IP suggest discourse goals for IS. These
Anticipated Discourse Goals provide very strong
expectations for IS and may often be accomplished
implicitly as well as explicitly.
The discourse goals of the previous section
also serve as anticipated discourse goals. Three
additional anticipated discourse goals appear to
play a major role in determining how elliptical
fragments are interpreted. One such anticipated
discourse goal is:

<bodyText confidence="0.9215524375">
Accept-Question: IP has posed a question to
IS; IS must now accept the question either
explicitly, implicitly, or indicate that he
does not as yet accept it.
Normally dialogue participants accept such ques-
tions implicitly by proceding to answer the ques-
tion or to seek information relevant to formulat-
ing an answer. However IS may refuse to accept
the question posed by IP because he does not
understand it (perhaps he is unable to identify
some of the entities mentioned in the question) or
because he is surprised by it. This leads to
discourse goals such as seeking confirmation,
seeking the identity of an entity, seeking clarif-
ication of the posed question, or expressing
surprise at the question.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.820014" genericHeader="method">
THE DISCOURSE STACK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998455838709677">
The discourse stack contains anticipated
discourse goals which IS is expected to pursue.
Anticipated discourse goals are pushed onto or
popped from the stack as a result of utterances
made by IS and IP. We have identified a set of
stack processing rules which hold for simple
utterances. Three examples of such stack process-
ing rules are:
[SP1]When IP asks a question of IS, Answer-
Question and Accept-Question are pushed onto
the discourse stack.
[SP2]When IS poses a question to IP, Expand-
Question is pushed onto the discourse stack.
Once IP begins answering the question, the
stack is popped up to and including the
Expand-Question discourse goal.
[5P3]When LS&apos;s utterance does not pursue a goal
suggested by the top entry on the discourse
stack, this entry is popped from the stack.
The motivation for these rules is the following.
When IP asks a question of IS, IS is first
expected to accept the question, either implicitly
or explicitly, and then answer the question. Upon
posing a question to IP, IS is expected to expand
upon this question with subsequent utterances or
wait until IP produces an answer to the question.
Although the strongest expectations are that IS
will pursue a goal suggested by the top element of
the discourse stack, this anticipated discourse
goal can be passed over, at which point it no
longer suggests expectations for utterances.

DISCOURSE INTERPRETATION COMPONENT

The discourse component employs discourse
expectation rules and discourse goal rules. The
discourse expectation rules use the discourse

and activate the associated discourse goal rules.
These discourse goal rules use the plan-analysis

tion of the fragmentary utterance relevant LA the
suggested discourse goal. If a discourse goal
rule succeeds in producing an interpretation, then
the discourse component identifies that discourse
goal and its associated interpretation as its

Discourse goal rules determine if an ellipti-

interpretation of the fragment. These discourse
goal rules use the plan-analysis component to help
determine the best interpretation of the fragmen-
tary utterance relevant to the suggested discourse
goal. However these interpretations are not
actual representations of surface speech acts;
instead they generally indicate elements of the
plan whose values the speaker is querying or
specifying. In many respects, this provides a
better &amp;quot;understanding of the utterance since it
describes what the speaker is trying to accom-
plish.

The discourse component calls the plan-
analysis component to associate the ellipti-
cal fragment with a term STERN or a conjunc-
tion of propositions SPEEDS in IS&apos;s underly-

mutually believed that IS already knows IP&apos;s
beliefs about the value of the term STERM or
the truth of the propositions SPEEDS, then
identify the elliptical fragment as accom-
plishing the discourse goal of expressing
surprise at the preceding response; in par-
ticular, IS is surprised at the known values
of STERN or SPEEDS in light of the new infor-

IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES

<bodyText confidence="0.999836384615385">
This pragmatics-based framework for process-

for a subset of discourse goals in a domain con-
sisting of the courses, policies, and requirements
for students at a university. The following are
working examples from this implementation.
The ellipsis processor is presented with a
semantic representation of IS&apos;s elliptical frag-

utterances by identifying the discourse goal which
IS is pursuing in employing the fragment and by

This example illustrates a simple request for
information.
IS: &amp;quot;Is CS360 offered in Fall 19857&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Do any sections meet on Monday?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;One section of CS360 meets on Monday at 4PM
and another section meets on Monday at 7PM.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;The text?&amp;quot;
Immediately prior to IS&apos;s elliptical utter-
ance, the discourse stack contains the entries
Accept-Response
Obtain-Information
The discourse goal rules suggested by Accept-
Response do not identify the fragment as accom-
plishing their associated discourse goals, so the
top entry of the discourse stack is popped; this
indicates that IS has implicitly accepted IP&apos;s
response. The entry Obtain-Information on the
discourse stack activates the rule DO-Obtain-Info.
Plan-analysis is activated to associate the
elliptical fragment with an aspect of IS&apos;s task-
related plan. The construction of STERN and
SPEEDS for this example was described in detail in
the plan analysis section and will not be repeated
here. Since our belief model indicates that IS
does not currently know the value of STERN such
that SPEEDS is satisfied, this rule identifies the
elliptical fragment as seeking information in
order to formulate a task-related plan; in partic-
ular, IS is requesting the value of STERN such
that SPEEDS is satisfied --- namely, the textbook
used in sections of CS360 that meet on Monday in
the Fall of 1985.

Our belief model indicates that IS already
knows that SPREES is satisfied; therefore the
discourse goal rule DO -Obtain•Corrob identifies
the elliptical fragment as expressing surprise at

IS: &amp;quot;I want to register for a course.

The first two utterances establish a plan context
of late-registering, within which the elliptical
fragment requests the fees involved in doing so.
(Late registration generally involves extra
charges.)
Figure 2 presents a portion of /S&apos;s underly-
ing task-related plan inferred from the utterances
preceding the elliptical fragment. The
parenthesized numbers preceding actions indicate
the action&apos;s focus domain. IS&apos;s fragment associ-
ates with the term
_lreg:I.MONEY
in IS&apos;s inferred plan, as well as with terms else-
where in the plan. However none of the other
terms appear in the same focus space as the most
recently considered action, and therefore the
association of the fragment with
_lreg:&amp;MONEY
is selected as most relevant to the current dialo-
gue context. The discourse stack immediately
prior to the elliptical fragment contains the sin-
gle entry
Provide-For-Assimilation
This anticipated discourse goal suggests the
discourse goals of 1)providing further information
for assimilation and 2)seeking information in
order to formulate the task-related plan. The
utterance terminates in a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, ruling out provide
for assimilation. Therefore rule DO-Obtain-Info

EXTENSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998571696969697">
The main limitation of this pragmatics-based
framework appears to be in handling intersentenr,
tial elliptical utterances such as the following:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is the teacher of CS200?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Herd is the teacher of CS200.&amp;quot;
LS: *CS263?&amp;quot;
Obviously IS&apos;s elliptical fragment requests the
teacher of CS263. Our model cannot currently han-
dle such fragments. This limitation is partially
due to the fact that our mechanisms for retaining
dialogue context are based upon the view that IS
constructs a plan for a task in a depth-first
fashion, completing investigation of a plan for
CS200 before moving on to investigate a plan for
CS263. Since the teacher of CS200 has nothing to
do with the plan for taking CS263, the mechanisms.
for retaining dialogue context will fail to iden-
tify &amp;quot;teacher of CS263&amp;quot; as the information
requested by IS.
One might argue that the elliptical fragment
in the above dialogue relies heavily upon the syn-
tactic representation of the preceding utterance
and thus a syntactic strategy is required for
interpretation. This may be true. However if we
view dialogues such as the above as investigating
task-related plans in a kind of &amp;quot;breadth-first&amp;quot;
fashion, then IS is analyzing the teachers of each
course under consideration first, and will then
move to considering other attributes of the
courses. It appears that the plan-based framework
can be extended to handle many such dialogues,
perhaps by using meta-plans to represent how IS. is
constructing his task-related plan.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997973125">
This paper has described a pragmatics-based
approach to interpreting intersentential ellipti-
cal utterances during an information-seeking
dialogue in a task domain. Our framework coordi-
nates many knowledge sources, including the
information-seeker&apos;s inferred task-related plan,
his inferred beliefs, his anticipated discourse
goals, and focusing strategies to produce a rich
interpretation of ellipsis, including identifica-
tion of the information-seeker&apos;s discourse goal.
This framework can handle many emwaples which pose
problems for other strategies. We claim that the
advantage of this approach is its reliance upon
pragmatic information, including discourse content
and conversational goals, rather than upon precise
representations of the preceding utterance alone.

This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances, including identification of the speaker&apos;a discourse pal in employing the fragment. We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone. /NTRODUCT/ON The fragmentary utterances that are common in communication between humans also occur in manmachine communication. Humans persist in using abbreviated statements and queries, even in the presence of explicit and repeated instructions to adhere to syntactically and semantically complete sentences (Carbonell, 1983). Thus a robust natural language interface must handle ellipsis. We have studied one class of elliptical utterances, intersentential fragments, in the context of an information-seeking dialogue. As noted by Allen(1980), such utterances differ from other forms of ellipsis in that interpretation often depends more heavily upon the speaker&apos;s inferred underlying task-related plan than upon preceding syntactic forms. For example, the following elliptical fragment can only be interpreted within context of the speaker&apos;a goal in the first utterance: [Eli] &amp;quot;I want to cash this check. Small bills only.&amp;quot; Furthermore, intersentential fragments are often employed to communicate discourse goals, such as expressing doubt, which a syntactically complete form of the same utterance may not convey as effectively. In the following alternative responses to the initial statement by SPEAKER-1, Fl expresses doubt regarding the proposition by whereas F2 merely asks about the jet&apos;s contents.</abstract>

[2] a discourse component that controls the interpretation of ellipsis based upon discourse goal expectations gleaned from the dialogue; this component &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; ellipsis by identifying Uhe&apos; discourse goal which the speaker is pursuing by employing the elliptical fragment, and by determining how the fragnent should be interpreted relative to that goal. [3] an analysis component that suggests possible associations of an elliptical fragment with aspects of the inferred plan for the information-seeker. [4] an evaluation component which, given multiple possible associations of an elliptical fragment with aspects of the information-seeker&apos;s underlying plan, selects that association most appropriate to the discourse context and believed to be intended by the speaker. INTERPRETATION OF INTERSENTENTIAL ELLIPSIS As illustrated by [EV], intersentential elliptical fragments cannot be fully understood in and of themselves. Therefore a strategy for interpreting such fragments must rely on knowledge obtained from sources other than the fragment itself. Three possibilities exist: the syntactic IMNIOMOMOOM. 041Taken from Flowers and Dyer(1984) 188 form of preceding utterances, the semantic representation of preceding utterances, and expectations gleaned from understanding the preceding discourse.</abstract>

Consider the following two dialogue sequences: SPEAKER: &amp;quot;I want to take a bus. The cost?&amp;quot; SPEAKER: &amp;quot;I want to purchase a bus. The oast?&amp;quot; If a semantic strategy is employed, the case frame representation for &amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; may have a &amp;quot;cost of bus&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;cost of bus ticket&amp;quot; slot; ambiguity arises regarding to which slot the elliptical fragment &amp;quot;The cost?&amp;quot; refers. Although 000 might suggest extensions for handling this fragment, a semantic strategy alone does not provide an adequate framework for interpreting intersentential ellipsis. The third potential strategy utilizes a model of the information-seeker&apos;s inferred task-related plan and discourse goals. The power of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and converaational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterances alone. Allen(1980) was the first to relate ellipsis processing to the domain-dependent plan underlying a speaker&apos;s utterance. Allen views the speaker&apos;s utterance as part of a plan which the speaker has constructed and is executing to accomplish his overall task-related goals. To interpret elliptical fragments, Allen first constructs a set of possible surface speech act representations for the elliptical fragment, limited by syntactic appearing fragment. The taskgoals speaker might pursue form a sat of expectations, and Allen attempts to infer the speaker&apos;s goal-related plan which resulted in execution of the observed utterance. A part of this inference process involves determining which of the partially constructed plans connecting expectations (goals) and observed utterance are &apos;reasonable given the knowledge and mutual beliefs of the speaker and hearer. Allen selects the surface speech act which produced the most reasonable inferred plan as the correct interpretation. Allen notes that the speaker&apos;s fragment must identify the aubgoals which the speaker is pursuing, but claims that in very restricted domains, identifying the speaker&apos;s overall goal from the utterance Is sufficient to identify the appropriate response in terms of the obstacles present in such a plan. For his restricted domain involving train arrivals and departures, Allen&apos;s interpretation strategy works well. In more complex it is necessary the particular aspect of the speaker&apos;s overall task-related plan addressed by the elliptical fragment in order to interpret it properly. More recently, Litman Allen(1984) have extended Allen&apos;s model of task-plans and meta-plans. Lidaan currently studying the interpretation of elliptical fragments within this enhanced framework. In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and plan-based strategies, a few other heuristics have been utilized. Carbonell(1983) U3S3 discourse expectation rules that suggest a set of expected user utterances and relate elliptical fragments to expected patterns. For example, if the systhe user whether a particular value be used as the filler of a slot in frame, the system then expects the user&apos;s utterance to contain a confirmation or diaconfirmation pattern, a different filler for the slot, a comparative pattern such as &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot;, and so forth. Although these rules use expectations about how the speaker might respond, they seem to have little to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker. Real understanding consists not only of recognizing the particular surface-request or surface-inform, but also of inferring what the speaker wants to accomplish and the relationship of each utterance to this task. Interpretation of ellipsis based upon the speaker&apos;s inferred underlying task-related plan and discourse goals facilitates a richer interpretation of elliptical utterances. REQUISITE KRCWLEDGE A speaker can felicitously employ intersentential ellipsis only if he believes his utterance be properly understood. The motivation this work is the hypothesis that speaker and hearer mutually believe that certain knowledge has been aoquired during the course of the dialogue and that this factual knowledge along with other processing knowledge will be used to deduce the speaker&apos;s intentions. We claim that the requisite factual knowledge includes the speaker&apos;s inferred task-related plan, the speaker&apos;s inferred beliefs, and the anticipated discourse goals of the speaker; We claim that the requisite processing knowledge includes plan recognition strategies and focusing techniques. 1. Task-Related Plan In a cooperative information-seeking dialogue, the information-provider is expected to infer the information-seeker&apos;s underlying task-related plan as the dialogue progresses. At any point in the dialogue, IS (the information-seeker) believes that some subset of this plan has been communicated to IP (the information-provider); therefore IS feels justified in formulating utterances under the assumption that IP will use this inferred task model to interpret utterances, including elliptical fragsenta. 189 An example will illustrate the importance of IS&apos;a inferred task-related plan in interpreting In the following, IS purchase of a home mentioned earlier in the dialogue: LS: &amp;quot;What elementary school do children in Rolling Hills attend?&amp;quot; IP: &amp;quot;They attend Castle Elementary.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Any nearby An informal poll indicates that most people interpret the last utterance as a request for swim clubs near the property under consideration in Rolling Hills and that the reason for such an interpretation is their inference that IS is investigating recreational facilities that might be used if IS were to purchase the home. However, if we substitute the fragment &amp;quot;Any nearby day-care centers?&amp;quot; for the last utterance in the dialogue, then interpretation depends upon whether one believes IS wants his/her children to be bused, or perhaps even walk, to day-care directly from school. 2. Shared Beliefs Shared beliefs of facts, beliefs which the listener believes speaker and listener mutually hold, are a second component of factual knowledge intersentential elliptical fragments. These shared beliefs either represent presumed a priori knowledge of the domain, such as presumption that dialogue participants university domain know that each course has a&apos; teacher, or beliefs derived from the dialogue itself. An example of the latter occurs if IP tells IS that CS360 is a 5 credit hour course; IS may not himself believe that CS360 is a 5 credit hour course, but as a result of IP&apos;s utterance, he does believe it is mutually believed that IP believes this. Understanding utterances requires that we identify the speaker&apos;s discourse goal in making the utterance. Shared beliefs, often called mutual beliefs, form a part of communicated knowledge used to interpret utterances and identify discourse goals in a cooperative dialogue. The following example illustrates how IP&apos;s beliefs about IS influence understanding. IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS400?&amp;quot; IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown is teaching CS400.&amp;quot; IS: &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; The fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; is a request know whether CS400 at night. However, if one precedes the above utterances with a query whose response informs IS that CS400 meets only at night, then the last utterance, &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; becomes an objection and request for corroboration or explanation. The reason for this difference in interpretation is the difference in beliefs the time the elliptical fragment is uttered. In the latter case, IP believes it is believed that IS already beliefs regarding when CS400 meets, so a request that information felicitous and a different intention or discourse goal in attributed to IS. Allen and Perrault(1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and suggested their use in clarification and correction dialogues. Sidner(1983) models user beliefs about system capabilities in her work on recognizing speaker intention in utterances. 3. Anticipated Discourse Goals The speaker&apos;s anticipated discourse goals form a third component of factual knowledge required for processing elliptical fragments. The dialogue preceding an elliptical utterance may suggest discourse goals for the speaker; these suggested discourse goals become shared knowledge between speaker and hearer. As a result, the is On for the speaker to anticipated discourse goals and interprets utterances accordingly. Consider for example the following dialogue: IP: &amp;quot;Have you taken CS105 or C3170?&amp;quot; IS: &amp;quot;At the University of Delaware?&amp;quot; IP: *No, anywhere.&amp;quot; at Penn State.&amp;quot; this example, IP&apos;s initial a strong anticipation that IS will pursue the goal of providing the requested informa- Therefore subsequent utterances are preted with the expectation that IS will eventuaddress this goal. IS&apos;s first utterance interpreted as pursuing a discourse goal of seeking clarification of the question posed by IP; IS&apos;s last utterance answers the initial query posed by IP. However discourse expectations do not persist forever with intervening utterances. 4. Processing Knowledge Plan-recognition strategies and focusing techniques are necessary components of processing knowledge for interpreting intersentential Plan-recognition strategies are tial in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan and focusing techniques are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Focusing aechaniams have been employed by Grosz(1977) in identifying the referents of definite noun phrases, by Robinson(1981) in interpreting verb phrases, by Sidner(1981) in anaphora resolution, by Carberry(1983) in plan inference, and by McKeown( 1982) in natural language generation. 190 FRAMEWORK FOR PROCESSING ELLIPSIS an utterance is parsed as a fragment, ellipsis processing begins. A model of any preceding dialogue contains a context tree (Carberry, 1983) corresponding to IS&apos;s inferred underlying task-related plan, a space containing IS&apos;s anticipated discourse goals, and a belief model beliefs. Our framework is a top-down strategy which uses the information-seeker&apos;s anticipated discourse goals to guide interpretation of the fragment and relate it to the underlying taskrelated plan. The discourse component first the element of the discourse stack and suggests potential discourse goals which IS might be expected to pursue. The plan analysis component uses the context tree and the belief model to suggest possible associations of the elliptical fragment with aspects of IS&apos;s inferred task-related plan. If multiple associations are suggested, the evaluation component applies focusing strategies to select the interpretation believed intended by the speaker --namely, that most appropriate to the current focus of attention ir. the dialogue. The discourse component then uses the results produced by the analysis component to determine if the fragment accomplishes the proposed discourse goal; if so, it interprets the fragment relevant to the identified discourse goal. FLAN-ANALYSIS COMPONENT 1. Association of Fragments The plan-analysis component is responsible for associating an elliptical fragment with a term conjunction of propositions IS&apos;s task-related plan. The analysis component determines, based upon the .current focus of attention, the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS&apos; s fragment and the discourse goal rules infer hcw IS intends the fragment to be interpreted. This paper will discuss three classes of elliptical fragments; a description of how other fragments are associated with plan elements is provided in (Carberry, 1985). A constant fragment can only associate with whose semantic type is the same or a supersemantic type of the constant. Furthereach term has a limited set of valid instantiations within the existing plan. A constant associates with a term only if IP&apos; s beliefs indicate that IS might believe that the uttered constant is one of the term&apos;s valid instantiations. For example, if a plan contains the proposition te ( AI-CON F JAN15) the elliptical fragment &amp;quot;February 2?&amp;quot; will associate with this proposition only if IP believes IS might believe that the starting date AI conference is in February. to such a belief model in order to allow for Yes-No questions to which the answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; and yet eliminate potential which a human listener would recognize as unlikely. Although this discarding of possible associations does not occur often in interpreting elliptical fragments, actual human dialogues indicate that it is a real phenomenon. (Sidner(1981) employs a similar strategy in her work on anaphora resolution. A co-specifier proposed by the focusing rules must be confirmed by an inference machine; if any contradications are detected, other co-specifiers are suggested.) A propositional fragment can be of two types. The first contains a proposition whose name is the same as the name of a proposition in the plan The second type is a more general sitional fragment which cannot be associated with a specific plan-based proposition until after analyzing the relevant propositions appearing in plan. The semantic representations of utterances by Smith?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;With Dr. Smith?&amp;quot; would produce respectively the type 1 and type 2 propositions &amp;SECT IONS, SMITH) Genpred(SMITH) The latter indicates that the name of the specific proposition yet unknown but that one of its parameters must associate with the constant Smith. A proposition of the first type associates with a proposition of the same name if the parameters of the propositions associate. A proposition of the second type associates with any proposition whose parameters include terms associating with the known parameters of the propositional fragment. The semantic representation of a term such as &amp;quot;The meeting time?&amp;quot; variable term _tme:&amp;MTG-TMES Such a term associates with terms of the same semantic type in IS&apos;s plan. Note that the existing plan may contain constant instantiations in place of former variables. A term fragment still associates with such constant terms. 2. Results of Plan-Analysis Component The plan-analysis component constructs a con- .unction of propositions PLPREDS and/or a term PLTERM representing that aspect of the information-seeker&apos;s plan highlighted by the elliptical fragment; STERM and SPREDS are produced by substituting into PLTERM and PLPREDS the terms in IS&apos;s fragment for the terms with which they are associated in IS&apos;s plan.</abstract>

Carbonell(1983) demonstrated this phemonenon in an informal poll in which users were found to interpret the fragment in the following dialogue as retaining the fixed media specification: size. of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;disks with two parts?&amp;quot; We have noted the same phenomenon in a student advisement domain. Thus when an elliptical fragment associates with a portion of the task-related plan or an expansion of one of its actions, the context established by the preceding dialogue must be used to replace information deleted from this streamlined, fragmentary utterance. The set of ACTIVE nodes in the context model form a stack of plans, the topof the current focused plan; each these plans expansion of an action appearing in the plan immediately beneath it in this stack. These ACTIVE nodes represent the established global context within which the fragmentary utterance occurs, and the propositions appearing along this path contain information missing from the sentence fragment but presumed understood by the speaker. TS the elliptical fragment is a proposition, the analysis component produces a conjunction of propositions SPREDS representing that aspect of the plan highlighted by IS&apos;s elliptical fragment. elliptical fragment is a constant, term, or with attached propositions, the component produces a term STERM associated with the or term the as well as a conjunction of propositions SPREDS. SPREDS consists of all propositions along the paths from the root of the context tree to the nodes at which an eleof the fragment is associated with element, as well as all propositions appearing along the previous ACTIVE path. The former represent the new context derived from IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance whereas the latter retain the previously established global context. This example illustrates how the plananalysis component determines that aspect of IS&apos;s plan highlighted by an elliptical fragment. It shows how the established context maininterpreting ellipsis.

EVALUATION COMPONENT The analysis component proposes a set of potential associations of the elliptical fragment with elements of IS&apos;s underlying task-related plan. The evaluation component employs focusing strategies to select what it believes to be the interpretation intended by IS --namely, that interpretation most relevant to the current focus of attention in the dialogue. We employ the notion of focus domains in order to group finely grained actions and associated plans into more general related structures. A focus domain consists of a set of actions, one of which is an ancestor of all other actions in the focus domain and is called the root of the domain. If an action member of a focus domain and that action is not the root action of another focus domain, then all the actions 030plan associated with the first action are also members of the focus domain. to Grosz&apos;s focus spaces and the notion of an object being in implicit focus.) The use of focus domains allows the grouping together of those actions that appear to be at approximately the same level of implicit focus a plan is explicitly focused. the actions of learning from a particular teacher, learning the material in a given text, and attending class will all reside at the same focus level within the expanded plan for earning credit in a course. The action of going to the cashier&apos;s office to pay one&apos;s tuition also appears within this expanded plan; however it will reside at a different focus level since it does not come to mind nearly so readily when one thinks about taking a course. The following are two of seven focusing rules used to select the association deemed most relevant to the existing plan context. [F1] Within the current focus space, prefer associations which occur within the current focused plan. [F2] Within the current focus space and current focused plan, prefer associations within the actions to achieve the most recently considered action. DISCOURSE GOALS We have analyzed dialogues from several different domains and have identified eleven discourse goals which occur during informationseeking dialogues and which may be accomplished via elliptical fragments. Three exemplary discourse goals are [1] Obtain-Information: IS requests information relevant to constructing the underlying task-related plan or relevant to formulating an answer to a question posed by IP. [2] Obtain-Corroboration: IS expresses surprise regarding some proposition P and requests elaboration upon and justification of it. Seek-Clarify-Question: IS requests information relevant to clarifying a question posed by IP. ANTICIPATED DISCOURSE GOALS When IS makes an utterance, he is attempting to accomplish a discourse goal; this discourse goal may in turn predict other subsequent discourse goals for IS. For example, if IS asks a question, one anticipates that IS may want to expand upon his question. Similarly, utterances made by IP suggest discourse goals for IS. These Anticipated Discourse Goals provide very strong expectations for IS and may often be accomplished implicitly as well as explicitly. The discourse goals of the previous section also serve as anticipated discourse goals. Three additional anticipated discourse goals appear to play a major role in determining how elliptical fragments are interpreted. One such anticipated discourse goal is: 193 Accept-Question: IP has posed a question to IS; IS must now accept the question either explicitly, implicitly, or indicate that he does not as yet accept it. Normally dialogue participants accept such questions implicitly by proceding to answer the question or to seek information relevant to formulating an answer. However IS may refuse to accept the question posed by IP because he does not understand it (perhaps he is unable to identify some of the entities mentioned in the question) or because he is surprised by it. This leads to discourse goals such as seeking confirmation, seeking the identity of an entity, seeking clarification of the posed question, or expressing surprise at the question. THE DISCOURSE STACK The discourse stack contains anticipated discourse goals which IS is expected to pursue. Anticipated discourse goals are pushed onto or popped from the stack as a result of utterances made by IS and IP. We have identified a set of stack processing rules which hold for simple utterances. Three examples of such stack processing rules are: [SP1]When IP asks a question of IS, Answer- Question and Accept-Question are pushed onto the discourse stack. [SP2]When IS poses a question to IP, Expand- Question is pushed onto the discourse stack. Once IP begins answering the question, the stack is popped up to and including the Expand-Question discourse goal. [5P3]When LS&apos;s utterance does not pursue a goal suggested by the top entry on the discourse stack, this entry is popped from the stack. The motivation for these rules is the following. When IP asks a question of IS, IS is first expected to accept the question, either implicitly or explicitly, and then answer the question. Upon question to IP, IS is expected to expand upon this question with subsequent utterances or wait until IP produces an answer to the question. Although the strongest expectations are that IS will pursue a goal suggested by the top element of the discourse stack, this anticipated discourse goal can be passed over, at which point it no longer suggests expectations for utterances. DISCOURSE INTERPRETATION COMPONENT The discourse component employs discourse expectation rules and discourse goal rules. The discourse expectation rules use the discourse stack to suggest possible discourse goals for IS and activate the associated discourse goal rules. These discourse goal rules use the plan-analysis component to help determine the beat interpretation of the fragmentary utterance relevant LA the suggested discourse goal. If a discourse goal rule succeeds in producing an interpretation, then the discourse component identifies that discourse goal and its associated interpretation as its understanding of the utterance. 1. Discourse Expectation Rules The top element of the discourse stack activates the discourse expectation rule with which it is associated; this rule in turn suggests. discourse goals which the informAtion-seeker&apos;s utterance may pursue and activates these discourse goal rules. The following is an example of a discourse expectation rule: the top element of the discourse stack Answer-Question, then 1. Apply discourse goal rule DG-Answer-Quest to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of answering the question. If no interpretation apply rule DG -Suggest -Answer-Question to determine the elliptical fragment used to accomplish the discourse goal of suggesting an answer to the question. 3. If no interpretation is produced, apply discourse goal rule EG -Obtain-Info to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of seeking information in order to construct an answer to the posed question. Once IS understands the question posed to him, IP&apos;s strongest expectation is that IS will answer the question; therefore first preference is given to interpretations which accomplish this goal. If does not immediately answer the question, we expect a cooperative dialogue participant to towards question. This entails gathering information about the underlying taskrelated plan in order to construct a response. 2. Discourse Goal Rules goal rules determine elliptical fragment accomplishes the associated discourse and, produce the appropriate interpretation of the fragment. These discourse goal rules use the plan-analysis component to help determine the best interpretation of the fragmentary utterance relevant to the suggested discourse goal. However these interpretations are not actual representations of surface speech acts; instead they generally indicate elements of the plan whose values the speaker is querying or specifying. In many respects, this provides a better &amp;quot;understanding of the utterance since it describes what the speaker is trying to accomplish. The following is an example of a rule associated with a discourse goal suggested by the stack entry Accept-Response; the latter is pushed onto the discourse stack when IP responds to a question posed by IS. 194 The discourse component calls the plananalysis component to associate the elliptical fragment with a term STERN or a conjunction of propositions SPEEDS in IS&apos;s underlying task-related plan. If IP believes it is mutually believed that IS already knows IP&apos;s beliefs about the value of the term STERM or the truth of the propositions SPEEDS, then identify the elliptical fragment as accomplishing the discourse goal of expressing at the preceding response; particular, IS is surprised at the known values of STERN or SPEEDS in light of the new information provided by IP&apos;s preceding response and the known aspect queried by IS&apos;s fragment. The following is one of several rules associated with the discourse goal Answer-Question. If the elliptical fragment terminates with a period, then the discourse component calls the plan-analysis component to associate the elliptical fragment with a conjunction of SPEEDS in IS&apos;s underlying taskrelated plan. If successful, interpret the elliptical fragment as answering &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, with the restriction that the propositions SPEEDS be eatisfie0 in the underlying roan. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES This pragmatics-based framework for processing intersentential ellipsis has been implemented for a subset of discourse goals in a domain consisting of the courses, policies, and requirements for students at a university. The following are working examples from this implementation. The ellipsis processor is presented with a semantic representation of IS&apos;s elliptical fragment; it &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; intersentential elliptical utterances by identifying the discourse goal which in employing the fragment and by producing a plan-based interpretation relevant to this discourse goal. This example illustrates a simple request for information. IS: &amp;quot;Is CS360 offered in Fall 19857&amp;quot; IP: &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; IS: &amp;quot;Do any sections meet on Monday?&amp;quot; IP: &amp;quot;One section of CS360 meets on Monday at 4PM and another section meets on Monday at 7PM.&amp;quot; IS: &amp;quot;The text?&amp;quot; Immediately prior to IS&apos;s elliptical utterance, the discourse stack contains the entries Accept-Response Obtain-Information The discourse goal rules suggested by Accept- Response do not identify the fragment as accomplishing their associated discourse goals, so the top entry of the discourse stack is popped; this indicates that IS has implicitly accepted IP&apos;s response. The entry Obtain-Information on the discourse stack activates the rule DO-Obtain-Info. Plan-analysis is activated to associate the elliptical fragment with an aspect of IS&apos;s taskrelated plan. The construction of STERN and SPEEDS for this example was described in detail in the plan analysis section and will not be repeated Since model indicates that IS does not currently know the value of STERN such that SPEEDS is satisfied, this rule identifies the fragment as seeking information order to formulate a task-related plan; in particular, IS is requesting the value of STERN such that SPEEDS is satisfied --namely, the textbook used in sections of CS360 that meet on Monday in the Fall of 1985. illustrates an utterance in which IS surprised by IP&apos;s response and seeks elaboration and corroboration of it.

IS&apos;s fragment associates with the term _lreg:I.MONEY IS&apos;s inferred plan, as well as with terms elsewhere in the plan. However none of the other terms appear in the same focus space as the most recently considered action, and therefore the association of the fragment with _lreg:&amp;MONEY as most relevant to the current dialogue context. The discourse stack immediately prior to the elliptical fragment contains the single entry Provide-For-Assimilation This anticipated discourse goal suggests the discourse goals of 1)providing further information for assimilation and 2)seeking information in order to formulate the task-related plan. The utterance terminates in a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, ruling out provide for assimilation.

<abstract confidence="0.939627390625">EXTENSIONS AND FUTURE WORK The main limitation of this pragmatics-based framework appears to be in handling intersentenr, elliptical utterances the following: IS: &amp;quot;Who is the teacher of CS200?&amp;quot; IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Herd is the teacher of CS200.&amp;quot; LS: *CS263?&amp;quot; Obviously IS&apos;s elliptical fragment requests the teacher of CS263. Our model cannot currently handle such fragments. This limitation is partially to the fact that our mechanisms dialogue context are based upon the view that IS constructs a plan for a task in a depth-first fashion, completing investigation of a plan for before moving on to investigate a plan CS263. Since the teacher of CS200 has nothing to with the plan for taking CS263, the dialogue context will fail to identify &amp;quot;teacher of CS263&amp;quot; as the information requested by IS. One might argue that the elliptical fragment above dialogue relies heavily upon the syntactic representation of the preceding utterance and thus a syntactic strategy is required for interpretation. This may be true. However if we view dialogues such as the above as investigating task-related plans in a kind of &amp;quot;breadth-first&amp;quot; fashion, then IS is analyzing the teachers of each course under consideration first, and will then move to considering other attributes of the courses. It appears that the plan-based framework can be extended to handle many such dialogues, by using meta-plans to represent how is constructing his task-related plan. CONCLUSIONS This paper has described a pragmatics-based approach to interpreting intersentential elliptical utterances during an information-seeking in a task domain. Our framework nates many knowledge sources, including the information-seeker&apos;s inferred task-related plan, his inferred beliefs, his anticipated discourse goals, and focusing strategies to produce a rich interpretation of ellipsis, including identification of the information-seeker&apos;s discourse goal. This framework can handle many emwaples which pose problems for other strategies. We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Ralph Weischedel for his encouragement and direction in this research and Lance Ramshaw for many helpful discussions and suggestions. REFERENCES 1.
