Kamp&apos;s Discourse Representation Theory is a major
breakthrough regarding the systematic translation
of natural language discourse into logical form. We
have therefore chosen to marry the User Specialty
Languages System, which was originally designed as
a natural language frontend to a relational database
system, with this new theory. In the paper we try
to show taking - for the sake of simplicity - Kamp&apos;s
fragment of English how this is achieved. The re-
search reported is going on in the context of the
project Linguistics and Logic Based Legal Expert
System undertaken jointly by the IBM Heidelberg
Scientific Center and the Universitat TÃ¼bingen.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999608833333334">
In this paper we are concerned with the systematic
translation of natural language discourse into Dis-
course Representation Structures as they are de-
fined in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)
first formulated by Kamp (1981). This theory re-
presents a major breakthrough in that it systemat-
ically accounts for the context dependent
interpretation of sentences, in particular with re-
gard to anaphoric relations.
From a syntactic point of view, however, Kamp
chose a very restricted fragment of English. It is
our goal, therefore, to extend the syntactic cover-
age for DRT by linking it to the grammars described
for the User Specialty Languages (USL) system
(Lehmann (1978), Ott and Zoeppritz (1979), Leh-
mann (1980), Soperla (1982), Zoeppritz (1984))
which are comprehensive enough to deal with realis-
tic discourses. Our main tasks are then to describe

- the syntactic framework chosen
- Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs)
- the translation from parse trees to DRSs
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782533333333">
The translation from parse trees to DRSs will, as we
shall see, not proceed directly but rather via Inter-
mediate Structures, which were already used in the
USL system. Clearly, it is not possible here to de-
scribe the complete process in full detail. We will
hence limit ourselves here to a presentation Kamp&apos;s
fragment of English in our framework.
The work reported here forms part of the devel-
opment of a Natural Language Analyzer that will
translate natural language discourse into DRSs and
that is evolving out of the USL system. We intend
to use this Natural Language Analyzer as a part of a
legal expert system the construction of which is the
objective of a joint project of the University of
Tubingen and the IBM Heidelberg Scientific Center.

2.1 Syntactic framework and parsing process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898692307692">
The parser used in the Natural Language Analyzer
was originally described by Kay (1967) and subse-
quently implemented in the REL system (Thompson
et. al. (1969)). The Natural Language Analyzer
uses a modified version of this parser which is due
to Bertrand &amp;al (1976, IBM (1981)).
Each grammar rule contains the name of an inter-
pretation routine, and hence each node in the parse
tree for a given sentence also contains the name of
such a routine. The semantic executer invokes the
interpretation routines in the order in which they
appear in the parse tree, starting at the root of the
tree.

In this section we give the categories and rules used

given below are somewhat simplified with regard to
the full grammars used in the Natural Language Ana-

3 Intermediate Structures

<bodyText confidence="0.996512333333333">
Intermediate Structures are used to facilitate the
translation from parse trees to the semantic repre-
sentation language. They are trees containing all
the information necessary to generate adequate ex-
pressions in the semantic representation language
for the sentences they represent.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984085">
3.1 The definition of Intermediate Structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999099">
The basic notions used in Intermediate Structures
are RELATION and ARGUMENT. In order to come to
adequate meaning representations it has also to be
distinguished whether RELATIONs stand for verbs
or nominals, therefore the notions VERBSTR and
NOMSTR have been introduced in addition. In case
of coordinate structures a branching is needed for
the ARGUMENTs. It is provided by COORD. In-
formation not needed to treat the Kamp fragment is
left out here to simplify the presentation.

3.1.1 Relation nodes and Argument nodes
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984653833333333">
Nodes of type Relation contain the relation name and
pointers to first and last ARGUMENT.
Nodes of type Argument contain the following infor-
mation: type, standard role name, pointers to the
node representing the contents of the argument,
and to the previous and next ARGUMENTs.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.964768">

Verb nodes consist of a VERBSTR with a pointer to
a RELATION. That is verb nodes are Relation
nodes where the relation corresponds to a verb.
Verb nodes (VERBSTR) contain a pointer to the RE-
LATION represented by the verb. They can be
ARGUMENTs, e.g., when they represent a relative
clause (which modifies a noun, i.e. is attached to a
RELATION in a nominal node).

<bodyText confidence="0.998405857142857">
Nominal nodes are Argument nodes where the AR-
GUMENT contains a nominal element, i.e. a noun, an
adjective, or a noun phrase. They contain the fol-
lowing information in NOMSTR: type on noun, a
pointer to contents of NOMSTR, congruence informa-
tion (number and gender), quantifier, a pointer to
referent of demonstrative or relative pronoun.

attaching a as last element to the list of ARGUMENTs
of the RELATION in the root of s and defining the
role name of the ARGUMENT forming the root of a.
4. If n and m are AIS, then n&apos; is a well-formed AIS,
if the root node of n contains a RELATION and m is
attached to its list of ARGUMENTs and a role name
is defined for the ARGUMENT forming the root of m.
5. If s is a SIS and a is an Argument node, then a&apos;
is an AIS, if s is attached to a and the argument
type is set to VERBSTR.
6. If a and b are AIS and c is an Argument node of
type COORD, then c&apos; is an AIS if the contents of a
is attached as left part of COORD, the contents of b
is attached as right part of COORD, and the con-
junction operator is defined.

3.2 The construction of Intermediate Structures
from parse trees
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.97660335">
To cover the Kamp fragment the following interpre-
tation routines are needed;
PRNAME and NOMEN which map strings of charac-
ters to elements of AIS;
NPDEF, NPINDEF and NPQUAN which map pairs
consisting of strings of characters and elements of
AIS to elements of AIS;
VERB which maps strings of characters to elements
of SIS;
NOM and ACC which operate according to Intermedi-
ate Structure formation rule 3;
RELCL which applies Intermediate Structure forma-
tion rule 5 and then 4;
COND which combines a pair of elements of SIS by
applying Intermediate Structure formation rule 5 and
then rule 3;
STMT which maps elements of SIS to DRSs.
These routines are applied as indicated in the
parse tree and give the desired Intermediate Struc-
ture as a result.

4 Discourse Representation Structures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956230769231">
In this section we give a brief description of Kamp&apos;s
Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). For a
more detailed discussion of this theory and its gen-
eral ramifications for natural language processing,
cf. the papers by Kamp (1981) and Guenthner
(1984a, 1984b).
According to DRT, each natural language sen-
tence (or discourse) is associated with a so-called
Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) on the
basis of a set of DRS formatior rules. These rules
are sensitive to both the syntactic structure of the
sentences in question as well as to the DRS context
in which in the sentence occurs.
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.3490495">
4.1 Definition of Discourse Representation Struc-
tures
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999729153846154">
A DRS K for a discourse has the general form K =
&lt;U, Con&gt; where U is a set of &amp;quot;discourse referents&amp;quot;
for K and Con a set of &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; on these indi-
viduals. Conditions can be either atomic or
complex. An atomic condition has the form
P(tl, ...,tn) or tl=c, where ti is a discourse refer-
ent, c a proper name and P an n-place predicate.
Of the complex conditions we will only mention
&amp;quot;implicational&amp;quot; conditions, written as K1 IMP K2,
where K1 and K2 are also DRSs. With a discourse D
is thus associated a Discourse Representation Struc-
ture which represents D in a quantifier-free
&amp;quot;clausal&amp;quot; form, and which captures the propositional
import of the discourse.
Among other things, DRT has important conse-
quences for the treatment of anaphora which are due
to the condition that only those discourse referents
are admissible for a pronoun that are accessible from
the DRS in which the pronoun occurs (A precise de-
finition of accessibility is given in Kamp (1981)).
Discourse Representation Structures have been
implemented by means of the three relations AS-
SERTION, ACCESSIBLE, and DR shown in the ap-
pendix. These three relations are written out to the
relational database system (Astrahan &amp;al (1976)) af-
ter the current text has been processed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.859766">
4.2 From Intermediate Structures to DRSs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951875">
The Intermediate Structures are processed starting
at the top. The transformation of all the items in
the Intermediate Structure are relatively straight-
forward, except for the proper semantic represen-
tation of pronouns. According to the spirit of DRT,
pronouns are assigned discourse referents accessi-
ble from the DRS in which the pronoun occurs. In
the example given in the appendix, as we can see
from the ACCESSIBLE table there are only two dis-
course referents available, namely ul and u2.
Given the morphological information about these in-
dividuals the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; can only be assigned the
discourse referent u2 and this is as it should be.
For further problems arising in anaphora resolution
in general cf. Kamp (1981) and Guenthner and Leh-
mann (1983).

5 Remarks on work in progress
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992875">
We are at present engaged in extending the above
construction algorithm to a much wider variety of
linguistic structures, in particular to the entire
fragment of English covered by the USL grammar.
Besides incorporating quite a few more aspects of
discourse structure (presupposition, ambiguitity,
cohesion) we are particularly ;nterested in formulat-
ing a deductive account for the retrieval of
information from DRSs. This account will mainly
consist in combining techniques from the theory of
relational database query as well as from present
techniques in theorem proving.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999505">
In our opinion Kamp&apos;s theory of Discourse Repre-
sentation Structures is at the moment the most prom-
ising vehicle for an adequate and efficient
implementation of a natural language processing sys-
tem. It incorporates an extremely versatile dis-
course-oriented representation language and it
allows the precise specification of a number of up to
now intractable discourse phenomena.

The syntax rules given below are somewhat simplified with regard to the full grammars used in the Natural Language Analyzer, but they have been formulated in the same spirit. For a detailed account of the German syntax see Zoeppritz (1984), for the Spanish grammar see Sopena (1982). Syntactic categories We need the following categories: &lt;NAME&gt;, &lt;NOMEN&gt;, &lt;QU&gt;, &lt;NP&gt; (features: REL, PRO, NOM, ACC), &lt;VERB&gt; (features: TYP=NI, TYP=NA), &lt;SENT&gt;, &lt;SC&gt; (feature: REL). Vocabulary The vocabulary items we have taken from Kamp (1981). &lt;NAME&gt; : Pedro, Chiquita, John, Mary, Bill, .. &lt;NOMEN: +NOM, +ACC&gt; : farmer, donkey, widow, man, woman, ... &lt;VERB:TYP=NI&gt; : thrives, ... &lt;VERB:TYP=NA&gt; : owns, beats, loves, admires, courts, likes, feeds,... &lt;QU&gt; a, an, every &lt;NP: +PRO, +NOM&gt; he, she, it &lt;NP: +PRO, +ACC&gt; him, her, it &lt;NP: +REL, +NOM&gt; who, which,</context>
