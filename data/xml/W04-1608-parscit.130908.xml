Arabic script-based languages are attracting increased attention for reasons that are
regrettably far from their intrinsic linguistic interest. At the same time, statistical and
corpus-based approaches to language processing are acquiring such dominance that it is
becoming difficult for the advocates of other methods even to receive a hearing. I will
argue that this is an alarming trend against which computational linguists, and especially
those studying these languages, should resist with great determination. My argument for
this position rests on the following observations:

<listItem confidence="0.9459355">
1. Unless the role of quantum mechanics and chaos in the workings of ordinary
language has been grossly underestimated, nothing about the subject is
probabilistic in any fundamental sense.
2. The statistics are a surrogate for knowledge of the world and artificial intelligence
and the performance of any system based on an approach that reduces this to
numerical annotations on linguistic structures can only hope to reach a very low
asymptote.
3. Thanks to Zipf’s law, corpus annotation is subject to a severe law of diminishing
returns to which the linguist’s search for significant generalizations is not subject.
4. To the various levels of linguistic analysis and to the indefinite range of subjects
and propositions that texts may treat, there correspond different notions of
locality, each requiring its own statistical models.
5. Most importantly, most of the linguistic properties that must be considered for
text processing are not emergent properties of the texts at all but crucially depend
on l’arbitraire du signe, the arbitrary relation between a symbol and what it
symbolizes.
