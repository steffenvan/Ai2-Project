<bodyText confidence="0.999861565217391">
While user attribute extraction on social
media has received considerable attention,
existing approaches, mostly supervised,
encounter great difficulty in obtaining gold
standard data and are therefore limited
to predicting unary predicates (e.g., gen-
der). In this paper, we present a weakly-
supervised approach to user profile extrac-
tion from Twitter. Users’ profiles from so-
cial media websites such as Facebook or
Google Plus are used as a distant source
of supervision for extraction of their at-
tributes from user-generated text. In addi-
tion to traditional linguistic features used
in distant supervision for information ex-
traction, our approach also takes into ac-
count network information, a unique op-
portunity offered by social media. We test
our algorithm on three attribute domains:
spouse, education and job; experimental
results demonstrate our approach is able
to make accurate predictions for users’ at-
tributes based on their tweets.1

The overwhelming popularity of online social me-

social networking websites such as Facebook2 or
Google Plus3 provides a rich repository personal
information in a structured data format, making it
amenable to automatic processing. This includes,
for example, users’ jobs and education, and pro-

line advertising, computational social science and
more.
Although profiles exist in an easy-to-use, struc-
tured data format, they are often sparsely popu-
lated; users rarely fully complete their online pro-
files. Additionally, some social networking ser-
vices such as Twitter don’t support this type of
structured profile data. It is therefore difficult to
obtain a reasonably comprehensive profile of a
user, or a reasonably complete facet of information
(say, education level) for a class of users. While
many users do not explicitly list all their personal
information in their online profile, their user gen-
erated content often contains strong evidence to
suggest many types of user attributes, for example
education, spouse, and employment (See Table 1).
Can one use such information to infer more de-
tails? In particular, can one exploit indirect clues
from an unstructured data source like Twitter to
obtain rich, structured user profiles?

ble to automatically extract Facebook-style pro-

files directly from users’ tweets, thus making
user profile data available in a structured format
for upstream applications. We view user profile
inference as a structured prediction task where
both text and network information are incorpo-
rated. Concretely, we cast user profile predic-
tion as binary relation extraction (Brin, 1999),
e.g., SPOUSE(Userz, User�), EDUCATION(Userz,
Entity�) and EMPLOYER(Userz, Entity�). Inspired
by the concept of distant supervision, we collect
training tweets by matching attribute ground truth
from an outside “knowledge base” such as Face-
book or Google Plus.
One contribution of the work presented here is
the creation of the first large-scale dataset on three
general Twitter user profile domains (i.e., EDUCA-
TION, JOB, SPOUSE). Experiments demonstrate
that by simultaneously harnessing both text fea-
tures and network information, our approach is
able to make accurate user profile predictions. We
are optimistic that our approach can easily be ap-
plied to further user attributes such as HOBBIES
and INTERESTS (MOVIES, BOOKS, SPORTS or
STARS), RELIGION, HOMETOWN, LIVING LOCA-
TION, FAMILY MEMBERS and so on, where train-
ing data can be obtained by matching ground truth
retrieved from multiple types of online social me-
dia such as Facebook, Google Plus, or LinkedIn.
Our contributions are as follows:

While user profile inference from social media has
received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al.,
2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010;
Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated
this as a classification task where the goal is to pre-
dict unary predicates describing attributes of the
user. Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013;
Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et
al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and
Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011).
A significant challenge that has limited previous
efforts in this area is the lack of available training
data. For example, researchers obtain training data
by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical
Turk to manually identify users’ gender from pro-
file pictures (Ciot et al., 2013). This approach is
appropriate for attributes such as gender with a
small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or fe-
male), for which the values can be directly iden-
tified. However for attributes such as spouse or
education there are many possible values, making
it impossible to manually search for gold standard
answers within a large number of tweets which
may or may not contain sufficient evidence.
Also related is the Twitter user timeline extrac-
tion algorithm of Li and Cardie (2013). This work
is not focused on user attribute extraction, how-
ever.
Distant Supervision Distant supervision, also
known as weak supervision, is a method for learn-
ing to extract relations from text using ground
truth from an existing database as a source of
supervision. Rather than relying on mention-
level annotations, which are expensive and time
consuming to generate, distant supervision lever-
ages readily available structured data sources as
a weak source of supervision for relation ex-
traction from related text corpora (Craven et
al., 1999). For example, suppose r(e1, e2) =
IsIn(Paris, France) is a ground tuple in the
database and s =“Paris is the capital of France”
contains synonyms for both “Paris” and “France”,
then we assume that s may express the fact
r(e1, e2) in some way and can be used as pos-
itive training examples. In addition to the wide
use in text entity relation extraction (Mintz et al.,
2009; Ritter et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2011;
Surdeanu et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012),
distant supervision has been applied to multiple

fields such as protein relation extraction (Craven
et al., 1999; Ravikumar et al., 2012), event extrac-
tion from Twitter (Benson et al., 2011), sentiment
analysis (Go et al., 2009) and Wikipedia infobox
generation (Wu and Weld, 2007).
Homophily Online social media offers a rich
source of network information. McPherson et
al. (2001) discovered that people sharing more
attributes such as background or hobby have
a higher chance of becoming friends in social
media. This property, known as HOMOPHILY
(summarized by the proverb “birds of a feather
flock together”) (Al Zamal et al., 2012) has been
widely applied to community detection (Yang and
Leskovec, 2013) and friend recommendation (Guy
et al., 2010) on social media. In the user attribute
extraction literature, researchers have considered
neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy
(Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al.,
2012), where information about the degree of their
connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included
in the feature vectors. A related algorithm by Mis-
love et al. (2010) crawled Facebook profiles of
4,000 Rice University students and alumni and in-
ferred attributes such as major and year of ma-
triculation purely based on network information.
Mislove’s work does not consider the users’ text
stream, however. As we demonstrate below, rely-
ing solely on network information is not enough to
enable inference about attributes.

We now describe the generation of our distantly
supervised training dataset in detail. We make
use of Google Plus and Freebase to obtain ground
facts and extract positive/negative bags of post-
ings from users’ twitter streams according to the
ground facts.

<bodyText confidence="0.999890580645161">
Education/Job We first used the Google Plus
API5 (shown in Figure 1) to obtain a seed set
of users whose profiles contain both their educa-
tion/job status and a link to their twitter account.6
Then, we fetched tweets containing the mention of
the education/job entity from each correspondent
user’s twitter stream using Twitter’s search API7
(shown in Figure 2) and used them to construct
positive bags of tweets expressing the associated
attribute, namely EDUCATION(Useri, Entityj), or
EMPLOYER(Useri, Entityj). The Freebase API8
is employed for alias recognition, to match terms
such as “Harvard University”, “Harvard”, “Har-
vard U” to a single The remainder of each corre-
sponding user’s entire Twitter feed is used as neg-
ative training data.9
We expanded our dataset from the seed users
according to network information provided by
Google Plus and Twitter. Concretely, we crawled
circle information of users in the seed set from
both their Twitter and Google Plus accounts and
performed a matching to pick out shared users
between one’s Twitter follower list and Google
Plus Circle. This process assures friend identity
and avoids the problem of name ambiguity when
matching accounts across websites. Among candi-
date users, those who explicitly display Job or Ed-
ucation information on Google Plus are preserved.
We then gathered positive and negative data as de-
scribed above.

education dataset contains 7,208 users, 6,295 of
which are connected to others in the network. The
positive training set for the EDUCATION is com-
prised of 134,060 tweets.
Spouse Facebook is the only type of social me-
dia where spouse information is commonly dis-
played. However, only a tiny amount of individ-
ual information is publicly accessible from Face-
book Graph API10. To obtain ground truth for the
spouse relation at large scale, we turned to Free-
base11, a large, open-domain database, and gath-
ered instances of the /PEOPLE/PERSON/SPOUSE
relation. Positive/negative training tweets are ob-
tained in the same way as was previously de-
scribed for EDUCATION and JOB. It is worth
noting that our Spouse dataset is not perfect, as
individuals retrieved from Freebase are mostly
celebrities, and thus it’s not clear whether this
group of people are representative of the general
population.
SPOUSE is an exception to the “ho-
mophily” effect. But it exhibits another
unique property, known as, REFLEXIVITY: fact
Is5pouseOf(e1, e2) and Is5pouseOf(e2, e1)
will hold or not hold at the same time. Given train-
ing data expressing the tuple Is5pouseOf(e1, e2)
from user e1’s twitter stream, we also gather user
e2’s tweet collection, and fetch tweets with the
mention of e1. We augment negative training
data from e2 as in the case of Education and Job.
Our Spouse dataset contains 1,636 users, where
there are 554 couples (1108 users). Note that
the number of positive entities (3,121) is greater
than the number of users as (1) one user can have
multiple spouses at different periods of time (2)
multiple entities may point to the same individual,
e.g., BarackObama, Barack Obama and Barack.

for each tweet zei,x, x E Lki in the first place, mak-
ing the stronger assumption that all mentions of an

of companies for Job attribute12. Lists of universi-
ties and companies are taken from knowledge base

bias friends to have a larger possibility to share
the same attribute. ΨNeigh(zki,e, Fik) captures such

<bodyText confidence="0.999972461538462">
We separately trained three classifiers regarding
the three attributes. All variables are observed
during training; we therefore take a feature-based
approach to learning structure prediction models
inspired by structure compilation (Liang et al.,
2008). In our setting, a subset of the features
(those based on network information) are com-
puted based on predictions that will need to be
made at test time, but are observed during train-
ing. This simplified approach to learning avoids
expensive inference; at test time, however, we still
need to jointly predict the best attribute values for
friends as is described in section 4.4.

observed (NEIGH-OBSERVED) or latent (NEIGH-
LATENT). Real world applications, where network
information can be partly retrieved from all types
of social networks, can always falls in between.
Inference in the NEIGH-OBSERVED setting is
trivial; for each entity e ∈ Gi, we simply predict
it’s candidate attribute values using Equ.6.
zki,e = argmax Ψ(z�, Xi, Fik) (6)
z,
For NEIGH-LATENT setting, attributes for each
node along the network are treated latent and user
attribute prediction depends on attributes of his
neighbors. The objective function for joint infer-
ence would be difficult to optimize exactly, and
algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale
to network of the size we consider. Instead, we use
a sieve-based greedy search approach to inference
(shown in Figure 3) inspired by recent work on
coreference resolution (Raghunathan et al., 2010).
Attributes are initialized using only text features,
maximizing Ψtext(e, Xi), and ignoring network
information. Then for each user we iteratively re-
estimate their profile given both their text features
and network features (computed based on the cur-
rent predictions made for their friends) which pro-
vide additional evidence.
In this way, highly confident predictions will be
made strictly from text in the first round, then the
network can either support or contradict low con-
fidence predictions as more decisions are made.
This process continues until no changes are made
at which point the algorithm terminates. We em-
pirically found it to work well in practice. We ex-
pect that NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than
NEIGH-LATENT since the former benefits from
gold network information.
Spouse For Spouse inference, if candidate entity
e has no correspondent twitter account, we directly
determine zki,e = argmaxz, Ψ(z&apos;, Xi) from text
features. Otherwise, the inference of zki,e depends
on the zke,Ci. Similarly, we initialize zki,e and zk e,Ci
by maximizing text factor, as we did for Educa-
tion and Job. Then we iteratively update zk given
by the rest variables until convergence.

tracted using Ritter et al.’s NER system (2011).
Consecutive tokens with the same named entity
tag are chunked (Mintz et al., 2009). Part-of-
speech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al’s
tweet POS system (Owoputi et al., 2013).
Data is divided in halves. The first is used as
training data and the other as testing data.

Our network intuition is that users are much more
likely to be friends with other users who share at-
tributes, when compared to users who have no at-
tributes in common. In order to statistically show
this, we report the value of AFFINITY defined by
Mislove et al (2010), which is used to quantita-
tively evaluate the degree of HOMOPHILY in the
network. AFFINITY is the ratio of the fraction of
links between attribute (k)-sharing users (Sk), rel-
ative to what is expected if attributes are randomly
assigned in the network (Ek).

5.3 Evaluation and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886833333333">
We evaluate settings described in Section 4.2 i.e.,
GLOBAL setting, where user-level attribute is pre-
dicted directly from jointly feature space and LO-
CAL setting where user-level prediction is made
based on tweet-level prediction along with differ-
ent inference approaches described in Section 4.4,
i.e. NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT, re-
garding whether neighbor information is observed
or latent.
Baselines We implement the following base-
lines for comparison and use identical processing
techniques for each approach for fairness.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961313416666667">
• Only-Text: A simplified version of our algo-
rithm where network/neighbor influence is ig-
nored. Classifier is trained and tested only based
on text features.
• NELL: For Job and Education, candidate is se-
lected as attribute value once it matches bag of
words in the list of universities or companies
borrowed from NELL. For Education, the list is
extended by alias identification based on Free-
base. For Job, we also fetch the name abbrevia-
tions15. NELL is only implemented for Educa-
tion and Job attribute.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999366222222222">
For each setting from each approach, we report
the (P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)1-score. For LO-
CAL setting, we report the performance for both
entity-level prediction (Entity) and posting-level
prediction (Tweet). Results for Education, Job and
Spouse from different approaches appear in Table
4, 5 and 6 respectively.
Local or Global For horizontal comparison, we
observe that GLOBAL obtains a higher Precision
score but a lower Recall than LOCAL(ENTITY).
This can be explained by the fact that LOCAL(U)
sets zki,e = 1 once one posting x ∈ Lei is identified
as attribute related, while GLOBAL tend to be more
meticulous by considering the conjunctive feature
space from all postings.
Homophile effect In agreement with our ex-
pectation, NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than
NEIGH-LATENT since erroneous predictions in

<bodyText confidence="0.99514062745098">
NEIGH-LATENT setting will have negative in-
fluence on further prediction during the greedy
search process. Both NEIGH-OBSERVED and
NEIGH-LATENT where network information is
harnessed, perform better than Only-Text, which
the prediction is made independently on user’s text
features. The improvement of NEIGH-OBSERVED
over Only-Text is 22.7% and 6.4% regarding F-
1 score for Education and Job respectively, which
further illustrate the usefulness of making use of
Homophile effect for attribute inference on online
social media. It is also interesting to note the im-
provement much more significant in Education in-
ference than Job inference. This is in accord with
what we find in Section 5.2, where education net-
work exhibits stronger HOMOPHILE property than
Job network, enabling a significant benefit for ed-
ucation inference, but limited for job inference.
Spouse prediction also benefits from neighbor-
ing effect and the improvement is about 12% for
LOCAL(ENTITY) setting. Unlike Education and
Job prediction, for which in NEIGH-OBSERVED
setting all neighboring variables are observed, net-
work variables are hidden during spouse predic-
tion. By considering network information, the
model benefits from evident clues offered by tweet
corpus of user e’s spouse when making prediction
for e, but also suffers when erroneous decision are
made and then used for downstream predictions.
NELL Baseline Notably, NELL achieves high-
est Recall score for Education inference. It is
also worth noting that most of education men-
tions that NELL fails to retrieve are those in-
volve irregular spellings, such as HarvardUniv and
Cornell U, which means Recall score for NELL
baseline would be even higher if these irregular
spellings are recognized in a more sophisticated
system. The reason for such high recall is that as
our ground truths are obtained from Google plus,
the users from which are mostly affiliated with de-
cent schools found in NELL dictionary. However,
the high recall from NELL is sacrificed at preci-
sion, as users can mention school entities in many
of situations, such as paying a visit or reporting
some relevant news. NELL will erroneously clas-
sify these cases as attribute mentions.
NELL does not work out for Job, with a fairly
poor 0.0156 F1 score for LOCAL(ENTITY) and
0.163 for LOCAL(TWEET). Poor precision is ex-
pected for as users can mention firm entity in a
great many of situations. The recall score for

NELL in job inference is also quite low as job
related entities exhibit a greater diversity of men-
tions, many of which are not covered by the NELL
dictionary.
Vertical Comparison: Education, Job and
Spouse Job prediction turned out to be much
more difficult than Education, as shown in Ta-
bles 4 and 5. Explanations are as follows: (1)
Job contains a much greater diversity of mentions
than Education. Education inference can benefit a
lot from the dictionary relevant feature which Job
may not. (2) Education mentions are usually asso-
ciated with clear evidence such as homework, ex-
ams, studies, cafeteria or books, while situations
are much more complicated for job as vocabular-
ies are usually specific for different types of jobs.
(3) The boundary between a user working in and
a fun for a specific operation is usually ambigu-
ous. For example, a Google engineer may con-
stantly update information about outcome prod-
ucts of Google, so does a big fun. If the aforemen-
tioned engineer barely tweets about working con-
ditions or colleagues (which might still be ambigu-
ous), his tweet collection, which contains many of
mentions about outcomes of Google product, will
be significantly similar to tweets published by a
Google fun. Such nuisance can be partly solved
by the consideration of network information, but
not totally.
The relatively high F1 score for spouse predic-
tion is largely caused by the great many of non-
individual related entities in the dataset, the iden-
tification of which would be relatively simpler. A
deeper look at the result shows that the classifier
frequently makes wrong decisions for entities such
as userID and name entities. Significant as some
spouse relevant features are, such as love, hus-
band, child, in most circumstances, spouse men-
tions are extremely hard to recognize. For exam-
ple, in tweets “Check this out, @alancross, it’s
awesome bit.ly/1bnjYHh.” or “Happy Birth-
day @alancross !”. alancross can reasonably be
any option among current user’s friend, colleague,
parents, child or spouse. Repeated mentions add
no confidence. Although we can identify alan-
cross as spouse attribute once it jointly appear
with other strong spouse indicators, they are still
many cases where they never co-appear. How to
integrate more useful side information for spouse
recognition constitutes our future work.

In this paper, we propose a framework for user at-

In this paper, we present a weaklysupervised approach to user profile extraction from Twitter. Users’ profiles from social media websites such as Facebook or Google Plus are used as a distant source of supervision for extraction of their attributes from user-generated text. In addition to traditional linguistic features used in distant supervision for information extraction, our approach also takes into account network information, a unique opportunity offered by social media.

The details of our model are presented in Section 4. We present experimental results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 2 Related Work While user profile inference from social media has received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al., 2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated this as a classification task where the goal is to predict unary predicates describing attributes of the user. Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011). A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data. For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to</context>

Homophily Online social media offers a rich source of network information. McPherson et al. (2001) discovered that people sharing more attributes such as background or hobby have a higher chance of becoming friends in social media. This property, known as HOMOPHILY (summarized by the proverb “birds of a feather flock together”) (Al Zamal et al., 2012) has been widely applied to community detection (Yang and Leskovec, 2013) and friend recommendation (Guy et al., 2010) on social media. In the user attribute extraction literature, researchers have considered neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), where information about the degree of their connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included in the feature vectors.

Concretely, we cast user profile prediction as binary relation extraction (Brin, 1999), e.g., SPOUSE(Userz, User�), EDUCATION(Userz, Entity�) and EMPLOYER(Userz, Entity�). Inspired by the concept of distant supervision, we collect training tweets by matching attribute ground truth from an outside “knowledge base” such as Facebook or Google Plus. One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the first large-scale dataset on three general Twitter user profile domains (i.e., EDUCATION, JOB, SPOUSE). Experiments demonstrate that by simultaneously harnessing both text features and network information, our approach is able to make accurate user profile predictions. W</context>

The creation of our dataset is described in Section 3. The details of our model are presented in Section 4. We present experimental results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 2 Related Work While user profile inference from social media has received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al., 2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated this as a classification task where the goal is to predict unary predicates describing attributes of the user. Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011). A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data. For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually identify users’ gender from profile pictures (Ciot et al., 2013). This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or female), for which the values can be directly identified.</context>

This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or female), for which the values can be directly identified. However for attributes such as spouse or education there are many possible values, making it impossible to manually search for gold standard answers within a large number of tweets which may or may not contain sufficient evidence. Also related is the Twitter user timeline extraction algorithm of Li and Cardie (2013). This work is not focused on user attribute extraction, however. Distant Supervision Distant supervision, also known as weak supervision, is a method for learning to extract relations from text using ground truth from an existing database as a source of supervision. Rather than relying on mentionlevel annotations, which are expensive and time consuming to generate, distant supervision leverages readily available structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for relation extraction from related text corpora (Craven et al., 1999).

For userlevel attribute prediction, we adopt the following two strategies: (1) GLOBAL directly makes aggregate (entity) level prediction for zki,e, where features for all tweets from Lei are aggregated to one vector for training and testing, following Mintz et al. (2009). (2) LOCAL makes local tweet-level predictions for each tweet zei,x, x E Lki in the first place, making the stronger assumption that all mentions of an entity in the users’ profile are expressing the associated attribute.

In order to statistically show this, we report the value of AFFINITY defined by Mislove et al (2010), which is used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of HOMOPHILY in the network.

Consecutive tokens with the same named entity tag are chunked (Mintz et al., 2009). Part-ofspeech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al’s tweet POS system (Owoputi et al., 2013). Data is divided in halves. The first is used as training data and the other as testing data. P P i jCF i k I P(7) m T k m(T k m − 1) Ek =Uk(Uk − 1) where Tkm denotes the number of users with m value for attribute k and Uk = Pm Tk m. Table 3 shows the affinity value of the Education and Job. As we can see, the property of HOMOPHILY indeed exists among users in the social network with respect to Education and Job attribute, as significant affinity is observed. In particular, the affinity value for Education is 74.3, implying that users connected by a link in the network are 74.3 times more lik</context>

Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011). A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data. For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually identify users’ gender from profile pictures (Ciot et al., 2013). This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or female), for which the values can be directly identified. However for attributes such as spouse or education there are many possible values, making it impossible to manually sea</context>

(2001) discovered that people sharing more attributes such as background or hobby have a higher chance of becoming friends in social media. This property, known as HOMOPHILY (summarized by the proverb “birds of a feather flock together”) (Al Zamal et al., 2012) has been widely applied to community detection (Yang and Leskovec, 2013) and friend recommendation (Guy et al., 2010) on social media. In the user attribute extraction literature, researchers have considered neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), where information about the degree of their connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included in the feature vectors. A related algorithm by Mislove et al. (2010) crawled Facebook profiles of 4,000 Rice University students and alumni and inferred attributes such as major and year of matriculation purely based on network information. Mislove’s work does not consider the users’ text stream, however.

The objective function for joint inference would be difficult to optimize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale to network of the size we consider. Instead, we use a sieve-based greedy search approach to inference (shown in Figure 3) inspired by recent work on coreference resolution (Raghunathan et al., 2010). Attributes are initialized using only text features, maximizing Ψtext(e, Xi), and ignoring network information. Then for each user we iteratively reestimate their profile given both their text features and network features (computed based on the current predictions made for their friends) which provide additional evidence. In this way, highly confident predictions will be made strictly from text in the first round, then the network can either support or contradict low confidence predictions as more decisions are made. This process continues until no changes are made at which point the algori</context>
