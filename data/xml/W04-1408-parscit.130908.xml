<bodyText confidence="0.999854636363636">
Translators are increasingly turning to
electronic language resources and tools to help
them cope with the demand for fast, high-
quality translation. While translation memory
tools seem to be well known in the translation
industry at large, bilingual concordancers
appear to be familiar primarily in academic
circles. The strengths and weaknesses of these
two types of tool are analyzed in an effort to
recommend those circumstances in which each
could best be applied.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999596352112676">
Recent years have witnessed a number of
significant changes in the translation market.
Largely as a result of globalization, there has been
a considerable increase in the volume of text to be
translated. New types of text, such as Web pages,
have also appeared and require translation.
The increased demand for translation has been
accompanied by another trend: deadlines for
translation jobs have grown shorter. This is in part
because companies want to get their products onto
the shelves in all corners of the world as quickly as
possible. In addition, electronic documents such as
Web pages may have content that needs to be
updated frequently. Companies want to be sure that
their sites reflect the latest information, so
translators are under pressure to work very quickly
to ensure that the up-to-date information is
reflected in all language versions of the site.
Furthermore, it has been observed that in today’s
market, there is currently a shortage of human
translators (e.g. Sprung 2000:ix; Shadbolt 2002:30-
31; Allen 2003:300).
The increase in volume coupled with shorter
turnaround times has resulted in an immense
pressure on existing translators to work more
quickly, while still maintaining high quality in
their work. However, these two demands of high
quality and fast turnaround are likely to be at odds
with one another. Therefore, one way that some
translators are trying to balance the need for high
quality with the need for increased productivity is
by turning to electronic resources and tools.
One type of language resource that has become
popular is the bilingual parallel corpus, which is
essentially a collection of texts in one language
(e.g. English) alongside their translations into
another language (e.g. French). The two sets of
texts must be aligned, which means that links are
made between corresponding sections (e.g.
sentences, paragraphs) in the two languages.
Bilingual parallel corpora can contain a wealth
of useful information for translators, but in order to
be able to exploit these resources, some type of
tool is needed. There are two main types of tool
that can be used to search for and retrieve
information from a bilingual parallel corpus1: a
bilingual concordancer (BC) and a translation
memory (TM). While these two types of tool have
some common goals and features, they also have a
number of differences.
As we will see in the upcoming sections, BCs
can be considered to be “old technology” and they
are not well known in the translation industry
outside of academic circles. In contrast, TMs have
garnered a significant amount of attention in the
translation industry of late; they are very much in
vogue and are considered to be leading-edge
technology. Nevertheless, a number of translators
have expressed frustration and disappointment
when trying to apply TMs in certain contexts. It is
possible that some of the frustration experienced
by translators using TMs in certain situations could
be alleviated by using BCs instead. The aim of this
paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of the
two types of technology in an effort to determine
the strengths and weaknesses of each in order to
determine those situations where translators would
be best served by using a TM and those where they
may be better off using a BC.
Following the introduction, the paper will be
divided into four main parts. Part 2 provides some

background information, including a general
description of how the two types of tool work, with
reference to two specific tools – ParaConc and
Trados – that are representative of the categories of
BC and TM respectively. Part 3 contains a brief
assessment of the place occupied by these tools
within the translation industry today. Part 4
contains a more detailed comparative analysis of
the features and associated advantages and
disadvantages of each type of tool. Finally, Part 5
concludes with some general recommendations
about which translation situations warrant the use
of each type of tool.

2 General introduction to BCs and TMs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939">
The general aim of both a BC and a TM is to
allow a translator to consult, and if appropriate to
“reuse”, relevant sections of previously translated
texts. In the following sections, BCs and TMs will
be described with reference to ParaConc and
Trados, which are representative examples of these
respective categories of tool.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.954857">
2.1 ParaConc: an example of a BC2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949">
BCs, such as ParaConc, are fairly
straightforward tools: they allow translators to
search through bilingual parallel corpora to find
information that might help them to complete a
new translation. For example, if a translator
encounters a word or expression that he does not
know how to translate, he can look in the bilingual
parallel corpus to see if this expression has been
used before, and if so, how it was dealt with.
To use ParaConc, the source and target texts
must first be aligned, which means that
corresponding text segments are linked together3.
A semi-automatic alignment utility is included in
the program to prepare texts that are not already
pre-aligned. The initial part of the alignment
process is carried out in three stages: first the texts
are aligned based on headings, if any are present in
the texts, then alignment is carried out at the
paragraph level, and finally at the sentence level.
The software uses the formatting information in
files to carry out alignment of headings and
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.952783083333333">
2 In fact, ParaConc could more properly be termed a
multilingual concordancer, since it is possible to consult
texts in up to four languages at once. However, in the
context of this paper, we will refer to it as a BC and
discuss its use for comparing texts in two languages.
3 A detailed description of alignment techniques is
beyond the scope of this paper; however, alignment is a
non-trivial matter. Problems can arise, for example, if a
single source text sentence has been translated by
multiple target language sentences, or vice versa, or if
information has been omitted from or added to the
target text (e.g. to handle cultural references).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997612621621622">
paragraphs. Alignment at the sentence level is
achieved by applying the Gale-Church algorithm
(Gale and Church 1993). To make adjustments to
the alignment, the user can examine the aligned
segments and either merge or split particular
segments, as necessary. One important thing to
note is that the aligned units remain situated within
the larger surrounding text.
Once the texts are aligned, the translator can
consult the corpus. By choosing the basic search
command, the translator can retrieve all examples
of a word or phrase (or part of a word) from the
corpus. As shown in Figure 1, the search term
“head” has been entered and all instances of
“head” from the English corpus are displayed in
the upper pane (here in a KWIC format). The
corresponding text segments from the French
corpus are shown in the lower pane.
The concordance lines can be sorted in various
ways (e.g., primarily 1st left and secondarily 1st
right) in order to group similar phrases together
and therefore make it easier for a translator to spot
linguistic patterns. Clicking on a concordance line
in the upper pane will highlight that line and also
the corresponding text segment in the lower pane.
Double-clicking on a line will bring up a window
containing the segment within a larger context.
Suggested translations for the English “head”
can be highlighted by positioning the cursor in the
lower French results pane and clicking on the right
mouse button. A possible translation of “head”
such as “tête” can be entered. The program then
simply highlights all instances of “tête” in the
French results window, which can then be
displayed (and sorted).
It is also possible to use a utility that presents a
list of “hot” words in the French results pane,

<bodyText confidence="0.992337214285714">
including possible translations. Some or all the
words listed can be selected and they will then be
highlighted in the results.
Finally, more complex search commands can
also be used if desired. Some of the possible
advanced search options are: Text search, Regular
expression search, Tag (part-of-speech) search,
Batch search, and various heading-sensitive and
context-sensitive searches. Of particular interest to
translators is a Parallel search, which allows the
user to enter both an English and a French search
word and to retrieve only those occurrences that
match both (e.g. only instances where “head” is
translated by “tête” and not by “chef”).

2.1.1 Potential limitations of BCs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999281333333333">
There are a number of potential limitations that
are often associated with BCs: 1) the limited
degree of automation; 2) the nature of the search
item; and 3) the nature of the matching process.
With regard to degree of automation, when using
a BC, it is up to the translator to decide what word
or expression to look up, and he then has to
manually type this into the search engine.
In terms of the nature of the search item, BCs are
generally designed to search only for words or very
short phrases. It is true that, in principle, a BC
could be used to search for an entire sentence or
paragraph; however, the fact that the search pattern
must be manually entered tends to discourage this
type of use because it would be extremely time-
consuming and error prone (e.g. typos).
Finally, BCs are sometimes criticized because of
the nature of the matching process that they use.
By default, these tools basically search through the
corpus for occurrences that match the entered
search pattern precisely. For example, if the
translator enters the search pattern “flatbed colour
scanner” into the concordancer, it will retrieve only
those occurrences that match that pattern exactly. It
will not retrieve an example that contains
differences in punctuation, spelling or morphology
(e.g. “flat-bed color scanners”). However, as noted
in section 2, some BCs, such as ParaConc, have
added more advanced search features to improve
the flexibility of searching.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990737">
2.2 Trados: an example of a TM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971444069444445">
Like a BC, a TM is a tool designed to help
translators identify and retrieve information from a
bilingual parallel corpus. However, one of the
motivating factors in developing TMs was to
overcome some of the seeming limitations of BCs
as described in section 2.1.1. Consequently, TMs
are more automated, can search for longer
segments, and employ fuzzy matching techniques.
The data contained in a conventional TM, such
as Trados4, are organized in a very precise way,
which differs somewhat from the way in which
data are stored for use with a BC. Trados divides
each text into small units known as segments,
which usually correspond to sentences or sentence-
like units (e.g., titles, headings, list items, table
cells). The source text segments are linked to their
corresponding target text segments and the
resulting aligned pair of segments is known as a
translation unit (TU). Each TU is extracted from
the larger text and stored individually in a
database. It is this database of TUs, not the original
complete text, that is later searched for matches.
When a TM, such as Trados, is first acquired, its
database is empty. It is up to the translator to stock
the database. This can be done interactively by
having the translator add each newly translated
segment to the database as he works his way
through the text, or it can be done by taking
previously translated texts and aligning them using
the accompanying automatic alignment program. It
is important to note, however, that in order to
ensure that the automatic alignment has been done
correctly, manual verification may be required.
When a translator receives a new text to translate
he begins by opening this new text in the Trados
environment. Trados proceeds to divide this new
text into segments. Once this has been
accomplished, the tool starts at the beginning of
the new source text and automatically compares
each segment to the contents of the TM database.
If it finds a segment that it “remembers” (i.e., a
segment that matches one that has been previously
translated and stored in the TM database), it
retrieves the corresponding TU from the database
and shows it to the translator, who can refer to this
previous translation and adopt or modify it for use
in the new translation.
Of course, language is flexible, which means
that the same idea can be expressed in a number of
different ways (e.g., ‘The filename is invalid’ /
‘This file does not have a valid name’).
Consequently, a translator cannot reasonably
expect to find many exact matches for complete
segments in the TM. However, it is highly likely
that there will be segments in a new source text
that are similar to, but not exactly the same as,
segments that are stored in the TM. For this reason,
Trados also employs a feature known as fuzzy
matching. As shown in Figure 2, a fuzzy match is
able to locate segments in the TM that are an

includes, among other things, an automatic aligner, a
terminology manager and a TM.

<bodyText confidence="0.998547348993289">
If more than one potential match is found for any
given segement, these are ranked by the system
according to the degree of similarity between the
new segment to be translated and the previously
translated segment found in the database. Note that
the similarity in question is a superficial similarity
(e.g., the number/length of character strings that
the two segments have in common) and not a
semantic similarity (thus “gone” and “went” will
not count as similar despite the similarity in
meaning of the two words). The match that the
system perceives as being most similar to the new
source segment is automatically pasted into the
new target text. The translator can accept this
proposal as is, edit it as necessary, or reject it and
ask to see other candidates (if any were found).
Trados also works in conjunction with
termbases; however, it is important to note that
these need to be manually pre-stocked by
translators with specialized terms and their
equivalents. By searching in the termbase – if one
exists – Trados can locate matches at the term
level and present them to the translator.
Nevertheless, there is still a level of linguistic
repetition that falls between full sentences and
specialized terms – repetition at the level of
expression or phrase. This is in fact the level where
linguistic repetition will occur most often.
Until recently, Trados permitted phrase or
expression searching only though a feature that
resembled a BC. In other words, a translator could
manually select an expression, and Trados would
search through the database of TUs to find
examples. In the most recent version of Trados
(v6.5), however, an auto-concordance function has
been added, which, when activated will
automatically go on to search for text fragments
when no segment-level match is found.
Once the translator is satisfied with the
translation for a given segment – which can be
taken directly from Trados, adapted from a Trados
match, or created by the translator from scratch –
the newly created TU can be added to the TM
database and the translator can move on to the next
segment. In this way, the database grows as the
translator works. Trados can also be networked so
that multiple translators can search and contribute
to the same TM.
3 BCs and TMs in the translation industry
A literature survey indicates that BCs and TMs
are both widely used in academic settings for
translator training. A long list of researchers (e.g.
Bernardini 2002; Hansen and Teich 2002; Palumbo
2002; Pearson 2000; Tagnin 2002; Zanettin 1998)
have shown that using BCs in conjunction with
parallel bilingual corpora can help students with a
range of translation-related tasks, such as
identifying more appropriate target language
equivalents and collocations; coming to grips with
difficult grammatical points (e.g. prepositions, verb
tenses, negative prefixes); identifying the norms,
stylistic preferences and discourse structures
associated with different text types; and
uncovering important conceptual information.
With regard to TMs, meanwhile, many translator
trainers (e.g. Austermühl 2001; Bowker 2002;
DeCesaris 1996; Kenny 1999; L’Homme 1999) are
now using TMs for tasks such as getting students
to analyze and evaluate different translation
solutions; helping students to learn more about
inter- and intra-textual features by examining
source texts and evaluating their characteristics in
an effort to determine whether or not they can be
usefully translated with the help of a TM; and
conducting longitudinal studies of students’
progress over the course of their training program.
In contrast to the academic setting, where both
BCs and TMs are well known and widely used, the
situation in the professional setting is somewhat
different: TMs are very popular, but the existence
of BCs does not seem to be widely known.
For example, TMs are discussed frequently in
the professional association literature. According
to newsletters/programmes circulated to members,
translators’ associations such as the American
Translator’s Association or the Association of
Translators and Interpreters of Ontario have
provided their members with opportunities (e.g.
demonstrations, workshops, professional
development seminars) to learn about TMs.
In addition, some professional translators’
associations, such as the Ordre des traducteurs,
terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec,
also publish magazines aimed at language
professionals, and in recent years, these have
included a number of discussions on TMs (e.g.
Bédard 1995, 1998; Arrouart and Bédard 2001;
Lanctôt 2001).
In those same publications, however,
considerably less attention has been paid to BCs:
only one event focusing on these tools was
reported (Evans 2002).
This raises the question as to why BCs appear to
have received a less enthusiastic welcome in the
professional world than have TMs. One factor that
may have led to a difference in uptake of these two
tools is the ease of access to such tools.
Firstly, it should be noted that BCs have long
been known in fields such as language teaching or
second-language learning (e.g. Johns 1986, Mindt
1986, Barlow 2000), but it is only more recently
that their potential as translation aids has been
recognized. Academics working in the field of
translation are often involved in, or have
colleagues who are involved in, language teaching,
and as such they may have gained exposure to BCs
in this way. Many of the existing BCs were
initially developed by academics who work in
language training5 often as a means of helping their
own students. This means that while such tools are
generally very reasonably priced and may be easily
accessible within the academic community, they
are sometimes not widely advertised or distributed
to the professional translation community because
the people who have created these tools have full-
time teaching jobs. In contrast, tools such as TMs,
which have typically been developed in the private
sector by companies that have professional full-
time programmers, technical support staff and
generous advertising budgets, are more actively
marketed to working translation professionals. The
fact that BCs do not seem to be well advertised in
the professional setting may explain, in part, why
translators and translators’ associations seem to be
more aware of the existence of TMs than they are
of BCs. This situation may change in the future,
however. As noted above, the use of BCs in
translator training institutes has become firmly
established since the late 1990s. This means that, at
present, most of the translators in the workforce
will have received their education during a time
when BCs were not part of the translator training
curriculum. However, over the coming years, the
number of BC-saavy graduates will increase and
they will bring to the workforce their knowledge of
BCs. They will be able to share their experience
with their colleagues and employers and gradually,
more and more companies will have translators on
staff who have an understanding of such tools.

4 Comparative analysis of BCs and TMs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978307692308">
On the surface, it may seem to be an obvious
choice for a translator to select a TM over a BC
since a TM includes the basic functions of a BC, as
well as a number of additional features (e.g.
automated searching, segment-level matching,
fuzzy matching). However, if one looks beneath
the surface, it seems that while TMs may be
favourable in some circumstances, there are other
situations where a BC may be the preferred tool. In
the following sections, we will examine the
strengths and weaknesses of BCs and TMs, using
ParaConc and Trados as representative examples
of these respective categories of tools.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.967253">
4.1 Automation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988088">
Automation is an oft-touted advantage of TMs.
In principle, automating the search feature should
speed up the process; however, this may not
always be the case. As pointed out by Bédard
(1995:28), it is possible to approach automation in
one of two ways: 1) an ambitious or high-tech
approach, using very sophisticated and highly
automated tools, such as TMs, or 2) a more modest
or low-tech approach, where the tools (e.g. BCs)
are simpler and require more user input.
In the case of the highly-automated approach,
there can be hidden costs. Because the tools are
more sophisticated, they may require a greater
investment of time and effort in learning how to
use them, which may prompt users to ask “What
have I got myself into?”. The pre-processing steps
(e.g. alignment) may also be more demanding
because an automated system depends more
heavily on correct alignment. As noted in section
2.2, in the case of Trados, if a translator wishes to
ensure that the alignment is absolutely correct in
order to prevent misaligned TUs being presented,
he must manually verify, and if necessary correct,
the alignment – a process that can be extremely
labour-intensive if the database is large. In
contrast, since the data generated by BCs is
designed for consultation by a human user, not a
computer, the alignment requirements are
somewhat less stringent. A certain number of
alignment errors can be tolerated in a BC because
the danger of “automatically” retrieving
misaligned segments does not exist, and if an error
does occur, the translator can simply look to the
preceding or following text to find the
corresponding segment because a BC does not
extract the segment from its surrounding text.
Because BCs can tolerate a certain margin of error,
the translator need not bother to manually verify
every alignment segment prior to beginning to use
the tool, which can represent a significant time
saving.
Another potential drawback of automation is that
the system searches for all matches, even in cases
where the translator may not need help with a
particular passage. For example, if the auto-
concordance feature in Trados is activated, it may
retrieve and display matches for phrases such as
“because of the” or “in order to”, for which an
experienced translator is unlikely to need
assistance. This can be distracting because the fact
that information has been retrieved means that the
translator will probably at least have a brief look at
what the system has proposed, which takes time
and is disruptive to the translation process. And the
return on investment is bound to be low for time
spent looking at matches for segments for which
no translation assistance was required in the first
place. In contrast, when working with a BC, the
translator initiates the searches and therefore only
looks for passages for which he requires help.
In addition, the fact that many TMs, including
Trados, automatically copy and paste fuzzy
matches or term matches directly into the target
text can sometimes be a hindrance. Depending on
the amount of editing required to produce a
desirable target segment, it may actually be faster
for the translator to type the translation from
scratch rather than editing the proposed segment.
In contrast, a BC does not automatically paste any
text directly into the target document, which can be
a good thing or a bad thing depending on the
quality of the match retrieved.
A small point, but one that is worth mentioning
nonetheless is that TMs often require a great deal
of user-initiated clicking in order to view or use the
“automatically” retrieved information. For
example, in Trados, when working in interactive
mode, the user must click in order to instruct the
system to conduct a search for each new segment.
Once the search has been conducted, only the
highest-ranked match is automatically presented to
the user, but depending on the translator’s needs,
this is not necessarily the match that will be the
most helpful. There are extra clicks involved in
pulling up and viewing additional matches. Lastly,
when the auto-concordance feature is activated, if
the system does not find any sentence-level
matches for the current segment, it automatically
opens the concordance window and displays the
results; however, in so doing, it makes the
concordance window the active window, so the
translator has to make a point of clicking back in
the target field before starting to type, otherwise
the text will be inadvertently written to the search
field of the concordance window. It is true that
there is also typing and clicking to be done when
using a BC, but the point we want to make here is
that BCs such as ParaConc do not profess to use
automation as a time-saver. Moreover, the lack of
automation may actually save time in some cases.
For example, in ParaConc, all the matches are
displayed at once and the user can peruse them at a
glance instead of having to click through them.
Finally, it should be noted that not all features of
TMs are in fact automated. In Trados, for example,
the termbase that is used to identify term matches
must be manually pre-stocked with term records by
the translator prior to beginning a translation job.
However, as pointed out by Arrouart and Bédard
(2001:30), when a translator consults a parallel
bilingual corpus using a BC, he has at his disposal
a sort of “full-text glossary” which, by its very
nature, contains countless “term records” that the
translator has not yet had the time to formalize.
Arrouart and Bédard go on to observe that one day,
such resources may well supplant carefully
managed collections of term records.
In summary, while less-automated tools such as
BCs appear to achieve less, they may be quicker to
provide translators with results they can actually
use, and they are likely to be more tolerant of
unexpected situations. Of course, using such tools
may call for a higher level of inventiveness or
creativity on the part of the user, but thankfully,
these are qualities that translators typically possess.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998269">
4.2 Search flexibility
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982441558442">
It was noted in section 2.1.1 that one of the
perceived limitations of BCs is the nature of the
searches that can be conducted. Typically, BCs
search for occurrences in the corpus that precisely
match the search pattern entered by the user. In
contrast TMs can make use of a fuzzy matching
technique that can identify patterns that are similar
to, but do not precisely match, the source segment.
However, a fuzzy match is not a panacea. When
using fuzzy matching techniques, the translator can
set the sensitivity threshold of the match; in other
words, the translator can decide how similar the
two segments must be in order for a TU to be
retrieved and displayed. Setting the appropriate
sensitivity threshold can actually be quite tricky: if
the threshold is set too high (e.g., 95% similarity),
then potentially useful matches may be overlooked
and the translator will be forced to do unnecessary
independent research. But if it is set too low (e.g.,
30% similarity), then irrelevant segments may be
erroneously retrieved and the translator will waste
time weeding through the non-pertinent data. In
addition, as noted in section 2.2, even if a fuzzy
match has a high percentage of similarity, it may
not be that useful to the translator since the
matching is based on surface structure similarities
rather than semantic similarities. For instance, the
following would be retrieved as a good match in a
TM since the two segments strongly resemble each
other on the surface, differing by only two
characters: File the form. / Fill the dorm.
In contrast, the following pair would not be
retrieved because they are not superficially similar,
though they are closely linked semantically: File
the form. / He is re-filing those forms.
A translator who is looking for an equivalent of
a given segment would find the translation of a
semantically-related segment to be more useful
than that of a segment which bears only a
superficial resemblance to the source text segment.
With a BC, a translator could use his own
knowledge of semantics to try to formulate more
relevant queries, but with a TM, the translator has
no input into the search patterns used.
Moreover, as mentioned in section 2.1, many
BCs have developed a number of additional
flexible searching techniques which, though still
manually initiated, can approximate to some extent
the results of a fuzzy match. For example,
ParaConc offers the possibility of using operators
such as wildcards as part of a search. If used
properly, these operators can increase the
flexibility of a search (e.g. by finding inflected
forms). However, as was the case with fuzzy
matching, they can also lead to problems if they
are not used rigorously. For instance, in an effort to
retrieve examples of all forms of the verb “to
enter”, a translator may input a pattern such as
“enter*” where the * can be used to represent any
string of characters. However, this pattern will also
retrieve occurrences of all other words beginning
with the string “enter” (e.g., “enterprise”,
“entertain”). As a result, the translator may
inadvertently be presented with irrelevant data.
The nice thing about working with a BC,
however, is that the translator does have control
over the search pattern that is entered, so by
learning the proper search syntax and by gaining
some experience, translators can learn which types
of patterns are likely to produce valuable
information and which are likely to waste time.
When working with a TM, however, the translator
has no control over the search pattern that is used.
For example, as mentioned in section 2.1, the
parallel search offered by ParaConc allows a
translator to limit a search to a given word sense,
whereas this cannot be achieved using a TM.

4.3 Consistency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978676470588">
Another highly advertised feature of TMs is that
they promote consistency in translation. The
question that has been raised by some translators,
however, is whether this is always desirable.
Merkel (1998:143) conducted a survey of 13
translators using TMs to carry out the translation of
software manuals. One of the questions asked was
whether they preferred consistent translations of a
given source segment in two different contexts.
The choice of answer was either “yes” or “no”,
with space for the respondent to elaborate on the
motivations for his/her choice. Upon examining
the completed questionnaires, Merkel noted that “it
became apparent that there was a need for a third
response, in between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, namely a
response which we can call ‘doesn’t matter’. This
applies when the translator in the justification for
the choice has indicated that the translation could
be consistent, but that it would not matter whether
the source segment was also translated
differently.” This raises an interesting point: in
contrast to what many TM vendors would have us
believe, while consistency may sometimes be
desirable, it may not always be strictly necessary.
Furthermore, there may even be cases where
consistency is not at all appropriate. For instance,
the translators consulted as part of Merkel’s survey
warn that there is a need to evaluate a proposed
match within the new context, and that it may not
always be automatically acceptable. This is
particularly true in the case of different structural
contexts (e.g. sentence vs heading vs table cell),
where caution should be used in applying
consistent translations (Merkel 1998:145).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99912">
4.4 Other quality-related issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
In addition to the question of consistency, other
quality-related issues have been raised by
translators working with TMs. One of the most
significant, which was briefly introduced in section
2.2, is the fact that TM databases store isolated
segment pairs, rather than complete texts. In the
words of Arrouart and Bédard (2001:30), a TM is
actually a memory of sentences out of context.
This can be problematic because the sentences in
a text generally depend on each other in various
ways. For example, when we read/write the third
sentence in a text, we can refer back to information
already presented in the first two sentences, which
means that it is possible to use pronouns, deictic
and cataphoric references, etc. However, if we take
that third sentence in isolation, it may not be clear
what the antecedents of such references are.
In addition, because languages do not have a
one-for-one correspondence or the same stylistic
requirements, translators who are trying to convey
the overall message of a text may map the
information to the sentences in the target text in a
way that differs from how that information was
originally dispersed among the source text
sentences. The result is that even if the two texts
are considered to be equivalent when taken as a
whole, the sentences in a translation may not
depend on each other in precisely the same way in
which the source text sentences do (Bédard 2000).
In order to maximize the “recyclability” of a
text, a translator working with a TM may choose to
structure the sentences in the target text to match
those in the source text, and he may choose to
avoid using pronouns or other references.
According to Heyn (1998:135), the result may be a
text that is inherently less coherent or readable, and
of a lesser overall quality. Bédard (2000) describes
this as a “sentence salad” rather than a text.
The sentence salad effect is exacerbated when
the sentences in a TM come from a variety of
different texts that have been translated by
different translators. Each text and translator will
have a different style, and when sentences from
each are brought together, the resulting text will be
a stylistic hodgepodge. It is highly unlikely that the
source text has been created in such a fashion (i.e.,
by asking a variety of authors to contribute
individual sentences), so it is questionable whether
this approach should be used to produce a
translation, which is also a text in and of itself.
Another quality-related problem is that errors
contained in TMs may come back to haunt a
translator if the database is not scrupulously
maintained in order to correct such errors. Lanctôt
(2001:30) provides the following account of a
translator who carefully stores all his translations
in a TM, but who does not update the contents to
reflect corrections made by the client to the final
document. When the client sends a document that
closely resembles a version of a document
previously translated the year before, the translator
uses the TM and blithely reproduces the same
errors in the new translation. The client is irritated
because the same passages that were corrected last
year need to be corrected again. This is not the
kind of added value the client was looking for.
It is worth pointing out that a BC will also
produce less-than-satisfactory results if the
contents of the corpus are not of high quality. The
main advantage offered by a BC in this regard is
that it is much more straightforward to update the
corpus with a corrected text than it is to fix
erroneous TUs in a TM.

4.5 Translators’ attitudes and satisfaction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999778643835617">
An important point to consider with regard to
any tool is whether or not the intended users enjoy
working with it. In the case of TMs, Merkel
(1998:140) observes that some translators “fear
that translation work will become more tedious and
boring, and that some of the creative aspects of the
job will disappear with the increasing use of
translation memory tools.” Merkel (1998:141) goes
on to note that there is concern that a translator
who works with a TM may be reduced to
somebody who simply has to press the OK button.
In a similar vein, Bédard (2000) expresses
concern that translators may lose motivation when
working with a TM because they risk becoming
“translators of sentences” rather than “translators
of texts”. In order to maximize recyclability when
working with a TM, translators are encouraged to
translate one source text sentence by one target text
sentence. However, as noted in section 4.4, the aim
of most translators is not to translate sentences, but
rather to translate a message. To do this
effectively, translators often need to work outside
the artificial boundaries of end-of-sentence
markers, and they may therefore feel constrained
by the sentence-by-sentence approach imposed by
TMs. In contrast, Arrouart and Bédard (2001:30)
have observed that when working with a BC, few
constraints are imposed by the tool and translators
are therefore more free to work as they wish.
Another difficulty that may be faced by
translators working with TMs is that they may be
biased by what the system presents. In other words,
after a translator has seen a suggestion from the
database, it may be difficult to think of another
way of expressing that thought, so he may use the
suggested translation even if it does not fit very
coherently into the text as a whole. When using a
BC, however, a translator is more likely to be
seeking inspiration for handling a shorter term or
expression, rather than a complete segment match,
so he is less likely to feel unduly influenced by the
overall structure of the sentence contained in the
corpus. He is also more likely to find examples of
that term used in a variety of ways, so he can pick
the usage that is most suitable for integration into
the text as a whole. In this way, a translator feels
like he is making his own decisions, rather than
having someone else’s decisions forced upon him.
The very fact that there are multiple ways to
render a given passage in another language may
also be a reason why some translators are unhappy
about using a TM. Merkel (1998:148) notes that as
part of his survey, translators were presented with
several different options as translations of a given
passage. The choice of “best translation option”
varied widely among translators, which leads him
to believe that it may be difficult to encourage
translators to accept suggestions from TMs.
A related problem that has to do with different
working styles of translators is described by
Lanctôt (2001:30). When multiple translators are
sharing a single TM over a network, it may be that
translator A, for example, works by ploughing
through a text to complete a full rough draft, and
he then goes back over the text a second and third
time to clean up any outstanding problems (e.g.
terminological, stylistic). In contrast, translator B’s
approach is to go more slowly, doing
terminological research and addressing stylistic
concerns as he goes along. In Lanctôt’s scenario,
translator B is frustrated by the suggestions
proposed by the TM – many of which were
produced as part of translator A’s first rough draft.

5 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992245614036">
The aim of this paper has been to introduce and
present an analysis of some of the strengths and
weaknesses of two categories of tool: BCs and
TMs. As noted in section 3, although TMs are
widely promoted in the translation industry, BCs
are less well known and, in some cases, translators
who are vaguely aware of them may erroneously
believe that such tools have been completely
superseded by TMs and therefore have no interest
for the translation community.
It is not our intention to promote one type of tool
over the other. Instead, we feel that the two
technologies may be considered complementary,
rather than competing, in the sense that one may be
preferred in certain circumstances, while the other
may be favoured in a different situation. Basically,
it comes down to a translator being aware of how
the two types of tool work and the potential
advantages that each offers. The translator must
then be able to choose the right tool for the job at
hand. What follows are some possible
considerations that a translator might take into
account when deciding which tool to use.
One critical factor that comes into play when
choosing which tool to use is the nature of the job
itself. Not all translation jobs are equal, and they
will not necessarily all benefit from the same
technology. Part of the frustration experienced by
some translators using translation tools may result
from them applying the tool in an inappropriate
situation. Sometimes it may be the client who
insists that a particular tool be used without really
understanding that it may not be suitable, whereas
in other cases, it may be the translator who is not
aware that another more appropriate tool exists.
Another consideration might be the size of the
job. In many cases, a translation job amounts to
just a few thousand words, which typically comes
with a short deadline. And since each job is
different, it may not be possible to use any tool
without making some adaptation to either the tool
or the corpus it will be used to process. As pointed
out by Bédard (1995:28), by the time the tool is
made operational, the deadline may be fast
approaching and the cost of getting the tool to
work may have exceeded the value of the job. As
noted in section 4.1, TMs typically require more in
terms of a learning curve and data preparation than
do BCs, so it may be that while a TM could
provide a good return on investment for a large
job, a BC might be a better choice for a small job.
Text type is also an important factor to consider.
There are certain types of texts and writing styles
that are highly conducive to being processed with a
TM. In particular, texts that are a revision of a
previous document (e.g. an updated version of a
user manual, a re-negotiated collective agreement),
are good candidates for translation with a TM
because they will contain many repetitions at the
sentence (or even paragraph) level. Another good
candidate for use with a TM is a text where the
repetitive sentences are varied (i.e., many
sentences with few occurrences of each) and
scattered throughout the document. However, such
documents are not the only type that translators
work with. Many translators are faced with texts
that contain repetition primarily at the sub-sentence
level. In such a case, since the manual searches
initiated by the translator using a BC may be more
flexible and productive than the auto-concordance
search in a TM, a BC may be preferable.
The choice may also be motivated by whether
the work is being done for a regular client or for a
new client. If a translator works regularly for a
particular client and has a corpus consisting
exclusively or primarily of similar types of texts
translated for that client, it may be reasonable to
use a TM since presumably the “sentence salad”
effect will be lessened by the fact that the
documents will all contain similar terminological
and stylistic preferences. In contrast, if the job is
for a new client and the corpus does not contain
previous work done for that client, perhaps a BC
would be a better choice since the translator could
consult it merely for inspiration without feeling
constrained by choices made previously to suit
other clients or text types.
The decision of whether to use a TM or a BC
may also depend on the translator’s preferred
working style. Just as some drivers prefer driving a
car with a manual transmission over one with an
automatic transmission, some translators may
favour a system that does a greater degree of
automatic text processing (e.g. TM), while others
may opt for one that does less (e.g. BC).
Another relevant issue may be the amount of
experience the translator has. A translator who is
very experienced may prefer the flexibility offered
by a BC, which allows him to look up only those
expressions for which he needs help. In contrast, a
translator who is just embarking on his career may
value the fact that a TM automatically makes
suggestions for all types of text strings.
A final factor that may come into play could be
cost. A single licence for a BC typically costs less
than $200 (US), whereas a single licence for a
limited version6 of a TM retails for closer to $1000
(US). It is true that there are usually additional
features present with TM software (e.g. a
termbase), and if these features will be used, then
the additional cost may be worthwhile. However, if
a translator intends to use mainly the
concordancing feature of a tool, then it may be
preferable to purchase a more modestly priced BC.

In those same publications, however, considerably less attention has been paid to BCs: only one event focusing on these tools was reported (Evans 2002). This raises the question as to why BCs appear to have received a less enthusiastic welcome in the professional world than have TMs. One factor that may have led to a difference in uptake of these two tools is the ease of access to such tools.

Moreover, the lack of automation may actually save time in some cases.

Finally, it should be noted that not all features of TMs are in fact automated. In Trados, for example, the termbase that is used to identify term matches must be manually pre-stocked with term records by the translator prior to beginning a translation job. However, as pointed out by Arrouart and Bédard (2001:30), when a translator consults a parallel bilingual corpus using a BC, he has at his disposal a sort of “full-text glossary” which, by its very nature, contains countless “term records” that the translator has not yet had the time to formalize. Arrouart and Bédard go on to observe that one day, such resources may well supplant carefully managed collections of term records.

However, as noted in section 4.4, the aim of most translators is not to translate sentences, but rather to translate a message. To do this effectively, translators often need to work outside the artificial boundaries of end-of-sentence markers, and they may therefore feel constrained by the sentence-by-sentence approach imposed by TMs. In contrast, Arrouart and Bédard (2001:30) have observed that when working with a BC, few constraints are imposed by the tool and translators are therefore more free to work as they wish. Another difficulty that may be faced by translators working with TMs is that they may be biased by what the system presents. In other words, after a translator has seen a suggestion from the database, it may be difficult to think of another way of expressing that thought, so he may use the suggested translation even if it does not fit very coherently into the text as a whole. When using a BC, however, a translator is more likely to be seeking ins</context>

In addition, because languages do not have a one-for-one correspondence or the same stylistic requirements, translators who are trying to convey the overall message of a text may map the information to the sentences in the target text in a way that differs from how that information was originally dispersed among the source text sentences. The result is that even if the two texts are considered to be equivalent when taken as a whole, the sentences in a translation may not depend on each other in precisely the same way in which the source text sentences do (Bédard 2000). In order to maximize the “recyclability” of a text, a translator working with a TM may choose to structure the sentences in the target text to match those in the source text, and he may choose to avoid using pronouns or other references.

In the case of TMs, Merkel (1998:140) observes that some translators “fear that translation work will become more tedious and boring, and that some of the creative aspects of the job will disappear with the increasing use of translation memory tools.” Merkel (1998:141) goes on to note that there is concern that a translator who works with a TM may be reduced to somebody who simply has to press the OK button. In a similar vein, Bédard (2000) expresses concern that translators may lose motivation when working with a TM because they risk becoming “translators of sentences” rather than “translators of texts”.

Problems can arise, for example, if a single source text sentence has been translated by multiple target language sentences, or vice versa, or if information has been omitted from or added to the target text (e.g. to handle cultural references). paragraphs. Alignment at the sentence level is achieved by applying the Gale-Church algorithm (Gale and Church 1993). To make adjustments to the alignment, the user can examine the aligned segments and either merge or split particular segments, as necessary. One important thing to note is that the aligned units remain situated within the larger surrounding text. Once the texts are aligned, the translator can consult the corpus. By choosing the basic search command, the translator can retrieve all examples of a word or phrase (or part of a word) from the corpus. As shown in Figure 1, the search term “head” has been entered and all instances of “head” from the English corpus are displayed in the upper pane (h</context>

It is highly unlikely that the source text has been created in such a fashion (i.e., by asking a variety of authors to contribute individual sentences), so it is questionable whether this approach should be used to produce a translation, which is also a text in and of itself. Another quality-related problem is that errors contained in TMs may come back to haunt a translator if the database is not scrupulously maintained in order to correct such errors. Lanctôt (2001:30) provides the following account of a translator who carefully stores all his translations in a TM, but who does not update the contents to reflect corrections made by the client to the final document. When the client sends a document that closely resembles a version of a document previously translated the year before, the translator uses the TM and blithely reproduces the same errors in the new translation. The client is irritated because the same passages that were corrected last year need to be corrected again. This is not the kind of added value the client was looking for. It is worth p</context>
<context position="40412" citStr="Lanctôt (2001" startWordPosition="6662" endWordPosition="6663">forced upon him. The very fact that there are multiple ways to render a given passage in another language may also be a reason why some translators are unhappy about using a TM. Merkel (1998:148) notes that as part of his survey, translators were presented with several different options as translations of a given passage. The choice of “best translation option” varied widely among translators, which leads him to believe that it may be difficult to encourage translators to accept suggestions from TMs. A related problem that has to do with different working styles of translators is described by Lanctôt (2001:30). When multiple translators are sharing a single TM over a network, it may be that translator A, for example, works by ploughing through a text to complete a full rough draft, and he then goes back over the text a second and third time to clean up any outstanding problems (e.g. terminological, stylistic). In contrast, translator B’s approach is to go more slowly, doing terminological research and addressing stylistic concerns as he goes along. In Lanctôt’s scenario, translator B is frustrated by the suggestions proposed by the TM – many of which were produced as part of translator A’s firs</context>

When working with a TM, however, the translator has no control over the search pattern that is used. For example, as mentioned in section 2.1, the parallel search offered by ParaConc allows a translator to limit a search to a given word sense, whereas this cannot be achieved using a TM. 4.3 Consistency Another highly advertised feature of TMs is that they promote consistency in translation. The question that has been raised by some translators, however, is whether this is always desirable. Merkel (1998:143) conducted a survey of 13 translators using TMs to carry out the translation of software manuals. One of the questions asked was whether they preferred consistent translations of a given source segment in two different contexts. The choice of answer was either “yes” or “no”, with space for the respondent to elaborate on the motivations for his/her choice. Upon examining the completed questionnaires, Merkel noted that “it became apparent that there was a need for a third response, in between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, namely a response which we can call ‘doesn’t matter’. This applies when the transla</context>

Furthermore, there may even be cases where consistency is not at all appropriate. For instance, the translators consulted as part of Merkel’s survey warn that there is a need to evaluate a proposed match within the new context, and that it may not always be automatically acceptable. This is particularly true in the case of different structural contexts (e.g. sentence vs heading vs table cell), where caution should be used in applying consistent translations (Merkel 1998:145). 4.4 Other quality-related issues In addition to the question of consistency, other quality-related issues have been raised by translators working with TMs. One of the most significant, which was briefly introduced in section 2.2, is the fact that TM databases store isolated segment pairs, rather than complete texts. In the words of Arrouart and Bédard (2001:30), a TM is actually a memory of sentences out of context. This can be problematic because the sentences in a text generally depend on each other in various ways. For example, when we read/write the third sentence in a text, we can </context>

This is not the kind of added value the client was looking for. It is worth pointing out that a BC will also produce less-than-satisfactory results if the contents of the corpus are not of high quality. The main advantage offered by a BC in this regard is that it is much more straightforward to update the corpus with a corrected text than it is to fix erroneous TUs in a TM. 4.5 Translators’ attitudes and satisfaction An important point to consider with regard to any tool is whether or not the intended users enjoy working with it. In the case of TMs, Merkel (1998:140) observes that some translators “fear that translation work will become more tedious and boring, and that some of the creative aspects of the job will disappear with the increasing use of translation memory tools.” Merkel (1998:141) goes on to note that there is concern that a translator who works with a TM may be reduced to somebody who simply has to press the OK button. In a similar vein, Bédard (2000) expresses concern that translators may lose motivation when working with a TM because they risk becoming “translators of sentences” rather than “translators of texts”. In order to maximiz</context>
<context position="39989" citStr="Merkel (1998" startWordPosition="6596" endWordPosition="6597"> a complete segment match, so he is less likely to feel unduly influenced by the overall structure of the sentence contained in the corpus. He is also more likely to find examples of that term used in a variety of ways, so he can pick the usage that is most suitable for integration into the text as a whole. In this way, a translator feels like he is making his own decisions, rather than having someone else’s decisions forced upon him. The very fact that there are multiple ways to render a given passage in another language may also be a reason why some translators are unhappy about using a TM. Merkel (1998:148) notes that as part of his survey, translators were presented with several different options as translations of a given passage. The choice of “best translation option” varied widely among translators, which leads him to believe that it may be difficult to encourage translators to accept suggestions from TMs. A related problem that has to do with different working styles of translators is described by Lanctôt (2001:30). When multiple translators are sharing a single TM over a network, it may be that translator A, for example, works by ploughing through a text to complete a full rough draf</context>

In those same publications, however, considerably less attention has been paid to BCs: only one event focusing on these tools was reported (Evans 2002). This raises the question as to why BCs appear to have received a less enthusiastic welcome in the professional world than have TMs. One factor that may have led to a difference in uptake of these two tools is the ease of access to such tools. Firstly, it should be noted that BCs have long been known in fields such as language teaching or second-language learning (e.g. Johns 1986, Mindt 1986, Barlow 2000), but it is only more recently that their potential as translation aids has been recognized. Academics working in the field of translation are often involved in, or have colleagues who are involved in, language teaching, and as such they may have gained exposure to BCs in this way. Many of the existing BCs were initially developed by academics who work in language training5 often as a means of helping their own students. This means that while such tools are generally very reasonably priced and may be easily accessible within the academic community, they are sometimes not widely a</context>
