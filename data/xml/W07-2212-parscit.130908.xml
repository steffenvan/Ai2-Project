Much of the activity in linguistics, especially
computational linguistics, can be thought of as char-
acterizing not languages simpliciter but relations
among languages. Formal systems for characteriz-
ing language relations have a long history with two
primary branches, based respectively on tree trans-
ducers and synchronous grammars. Both have seen
increasing use in recent work, especially in machine
translation. Indeed, evidence from millennia of ex-
perience with bilingual dictionaries argues for syn-
chronous grammars as an appropriate substrate for
statistical machine translation systems.
On the positive side, some new results have
integrated the two branches through the formal-
language-theoretic construct of the bimorphism. I
will present some background on this integration,
and briefly describe two applications of synchronous
grammars: to tree-adjoining grammar semantics and
to syntax-aware statistical machine translation.
On the negative side, algorithms for making use of
these formalisms are computationally complex, per-
haps prohibitively so. I will close with a plea for
novel research by the parsing technology commu-
nity in making the systems practical.
