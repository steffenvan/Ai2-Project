Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799666666666">
In this paper we discuss the development
of a multilingual collocation dictionary
for translation purposes. By ‘collocation’
we mean not only set or fixed expres-
sions including idioms, simple co-
occurrences of items and metaphorical
uses, but also translators’ paraphrases.
We approach this problem from two di-
rections. Firstly we identify certain lin-
guistic phenomena and lexicographical
requirements that need to be respected in
the development of such dictionaries.
The second and other direction concerns
the development of such dictionaries in
which linguistic phenomena and lexico-
graphic attributes are themselves a means
of access to the collocations. The linguis-
tic phenomena and lexicographical re-
quirements concern variously placing the
sense of collocations rather than head-
words or other access methods at the cen-
tre of interest, together with collocation
synonymy and translation equivalence,
polysemy and non-reversibility of the
lexis, and other more lexicographic prop-
erties such as varieties of language and
regionalisms, and types of translation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999976531914894">
In work with developing multilingual collocation
based dictionaries for translation purposes across
a wide variety of domains (Cardey and
Greenfield, 1999; Chan 2005) various interesting
linguistic phenomena and lexicographic require-
ments have been observed. In the context of such
dictionaries, by the term collocation we include
not only set or fixed expressions (Moon, 1995,
Tables 1.1 and 1.2, pp.19-20) including idioms,
simple co-occurrences of items (plane ticket) and
metaphorical uses (spill the beans), but also, as
we will show, translators’ paraphrases where
these are needed. Linguistic phenomena include
ones concerning sense (for example synonymy
and translation equivalence, polysemy and non-
reversibility). Lexicographical requirements in-
clude for example the requirement (for consis-
tency purposes amongst others) that the colloca-
tion (as article) be the centre of interest rather
than the headword(s) whose role is one of access
to the collocations. This is principally because
the object of such dictionaries should be based
on inter-lingual collocation sense group corre-
spondence, translation of headwords being essen-
tially incidental. Another way to view this is that
if what we wish to model is a dictionary of
senses, these senses are expressed by interpreta-
tions in the form of collocations. However, diffi-
culties are engendered with this approach. For
example, headwords are typically canonical in
form whilst their corresponding lexical units in
collocations can be variants (for example in-
flected or be derivations). Furthermore, in reality
the definition of a collocation structure for lexi-
cographic purposes can itself be complex, for
example to cater for or indicate information such
as inflected forms, synonymy and translation
equivalence, grammatical labelling and com-
ments (Gaveiro, 1998, pp. 26 - 27, 64 - 65).
More recently, our interest has been concerned
with how to develop such multilingual colloca-
tion dictionaries including access to collocations
based on linguistic phenomena as well as by
headwords (a headword can only be a single
word, even for idioms) (Chan, 2005) where the
issues of particular cases at the semantic level
and at the grammatical level are important. Here

the access to collocations can be by posing a
problem; one can ask for those collocations
which present a problem of article for example.
The linguistic phenomena and lexicographic
requirements are ones that are candidates for
modelling such dictionaries using formal meth-
ods, for example using the Z formal specification
language (Spivey, 1992), the impetus being that
certain domains in which such dictionaries are
used are safety critical in nature. This has re-
sulted in work in respect of the state invariants
peculiar to specialised multilingual collocation
based dictionaries (Greenfield, 1998a;
Greenfield, 1998b).
In response to these various observed linguis-
tic phenomena and lexicographical requirements,
the MultiCoDiCT (Multilingual Collocation Dic-
tionary System Centre Tesnière) system was de-
veloped as a research aid tool for multilingual
lexicographic research (Greenfield et al., 1999;
Greenfield, 2003). The basic model underpinning
MultiCoDiCT dictionaries reposes on the con-
cept of the collocation sense group as a means to
ensure integrity and consistent access to the col-
locations. In this model a collocation in a
language appears only once, whereas in
conventional dictionary models it is the
headword in a language that appears only once.
This constraint leads us to generality; not only do
we obtain reversibility of translation with no
extra effort, we obtain non-reversibility of the
lexis where this happens to be the case. Further-
more, headword access to a collocation also pro-
vides direct access to the other collocations in the
dictionary with an equivalent sense (or senses for
polysemic collocations).
More recently, work on linguistic phenomena
and lexicographic attributes based access to col-
locations (as well as headword access) has re-
sulted in a prototype system using an algorithmic
approach (Chan, 2005) using the Studygram sys-
tem (Cardey and Greenfield, 1992).
In the paper we first review the linguistic phe-
nomena and lexicographic requirements that we
have discerned for such multilingual collocation
dictionaries. We then discuss the development of
such dictionaries in which the linguistic phenom-
ena and lexicographic attributes are themselves a
means of access to the collocations. Finally, in
the conclusion we show how Studygram and
MultiCoDiCT can be integrated in order to pro-
vide a more general approach for the access to
such multilingual collocation dictionaries.
2 Linguistic phenomena and lexico-
graphic requirements
In the context of lexicographical research, collo-
cations as articles in multilingual dictionaries
present various linguistic phenomena and lexico-
graphic requirements which are sufficiently ge-
neric but also sufficiently important lexico-
graphically as to warrant some generalised sup-
port. The various phenomena and requirements
are illustrated in this section by the essentially
traditional headword access method to colloca-
tions as provided by the MultiCoDiCT system.
The linguistic phenomena concern synonymy,
polysemy and non-reversibility of the lexis in
translation. For example synonymy is indicated
by more than one collocation having the same
sense equivalence variously in the source lan-
guage or in the target language (in the illustra-
tions that follow the source language is on the
left and the target language is on the right); see
Figures 1 and 2.

In the above two examples, the Spanish colloca-
tions include annotations indicating regionalisms
such as (Spain) (Chan, 1999). We say that collo-
cations in the same or different languages which
are equivalent in that they have the same sense
are members of the same sense group. In the
above examples we can also observe various
lexicographical requirements such as headwords
and the use of structured annotations to display
the regionalism information.
Polysemy is indicated by the presence of
translations with different senses, that is, where a
collocation is the member of more than one sense
group. The example that we use is drawn from an
archtypical bilingual dictionary (Werthe-
Hengsanga, 2001) of Thai-French image expres-

sions in the zoological domain with the particu-
larity that the types of translation are shown by
lexicographic annotations as follows:
− Eq equivalent – supplied, provided that an
equivalent can be found
− LT literal translation – word for word
− AS analytical sense – literal translation re-
formulated in correct French
− FS functional sense – the true sense of the
translated collocation
The Thai is shown here by means of a phonetic
transcription using ASCII characters (which in
fact does not provide an adequate cover but this
matter is not pursued here). An example of a

<bodyText confidence="0.999982615384615">
In this dictionary which is restricted to the do-
main of clinical research (Gavieiro 1998), even
though there is a translation of the French head-
word antécédents by an English collocation
&apos;medical history&apos; (printed between quotes to indi-
cate it to be a collocation rather than a headword
in the target language), this is not the case for the
inverse sense for the English headword history.
Being a dictionary of collocations, the translation
of history as a headword has no place in such a
domain specific dictionary. On the contrary,
English collocations containing the headword
history have their place, they are translated to
French.
Lexicographic requirements can be divided
into those which concern the functionality of-
fered by the dictionary (for example, as we have
already seen, the use of annotations for various
purposes) and those which concern the organisa-
tion and integrity of the dictionary.
The functionality offered by such a dictionary
includes the method of access to collocations as
articles, the presentation of the articles in order
to display any of the linguistic phenomena pre-
sent (as has been illustrated by the examples
above concerning synonymy, polysemy and non-
reversibility of the lexis in translation), and the
organisation and provision of lexicographical
annotations.
For the access to collocations as articles this
can be as in conventional paper dictionaries by
means of headwords, typically in alphabetic
order. A headword is an individual lexical unit
whose primary purpose is to provide a means of
access to a collocation. In the MultiCoDiCT
system a headword is never the whole
collocation even for a fully fixed expression. A
given headword can access several collocations
(as is illustrated in Figure 4) and in like manner,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.97142875">
a collocation can be accessed by many
headwords. This can be seen for the collocation
antécédents médicaux with headwords

<bodyText confidence="0.999959913043479">
The headwords of a collocation require to be
specified; in the MultiCoDiCT system this is
done explicitly by the lexicographer. Because of
inflexional and derivational morphology, the
headwords are typically in a canonical form,
whilst the forms in the collocations can be vari-
ants; Figure 5 illustrates this for the French
headword &apos;médical&apos; which takes the variant form
&apos;médicaux&apos; in the French collocation. In Figure 4,
the case of the headword antécédents (nominally
a ‘variant’ (plural) of the canonical form anté-
cédent) is atypical, the lexicographical choice of
the form of the headword here being due to anté-
cédents being a short form of antécédents médi-
caux. Thus in the organisation of the dictionary
there must be, as is the case in the MultiCoDiCT
system, a mapping between headwords in their
canonical form and their ‘presence’ in colloca-
tions.
With annotations such as grammatical func-
tion (already shown in Figure 3) even the linguis-
tic phenomenon of grammatical variation can be
accounted for, as shown in Figure 6.

<bodyText confidence="0.999736416666667">
In the case of synonyms or polysemic equiva-
lences, a given word can ‘change’ its grammati-
cal role. In the first synonymic equivalence in the
example in Figure 6, the Spanish word terminal
is a noun whilst in the second it has as grammati-
cal function adjective because the word estación
has as role a noun. It should be noted that for the
two grammatical functions of the word form
terminal, in the Spanish lexis there is only one
headword for terminal.
We now turn to the phenomena which have an
impact on the organisation and integrity of such a
dictionary and thus its underlying model and
how this has been achieved in the MultiCoDiCT
system. We must deal with variously colloca-
tions, headwords and annotations and the various
interrelations between these such as sense groups
and furthermore the relation between headwords
and collocations, all these in a multilingual con-
text. There must necessarily be some means to
ensure the integrity of these various data items
and the relations between them.
The model that underpins the MultiCoDiCT
system is based on:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9838536">
• firstly the sense group to which one or
more collocations across one or more lan-
guages is associated in being sense
equivalent (a sense group is no more than
such an association),
• secondly the languages, to each of which
collocations are uniquely associated,
• thirdly the collocations and
• fourthly the headwords, which in the
MultiCoDiCT system are the only way to
access directly a collocation and its sense
equivalences (synonyms and translations).
(Acces to collocations by means of lin-
guistic phenomena is discussed in the next
section.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976">
In respect of annotations, the underlying
model allows these to be added at the level of
sense group, collocation (for example regional-
ism) or collocation lexical item (for example
grammatical category)
As far as the collocations which are the mem-
bers of a sense group are concerned, these can be
viewed orthogonally over two dimensions. One
dimension involves the language and here too
one or more languages may have a special status,
such as Latin in dictionaries of flora and fauna
which we address in the next section of the pa-
per. The other dimension concerns the nature of
collocations. Here we can type collocations as
either being ‘true’ collocations in terms of the
linguist&apos;s view, or, collocations which are trans-
lators’ paraphrases such as for example transla-
tion types as we have already discussed and
shown (Figure 3).

3 Linguistic phenomena and lexico-
graphic attributes as a means of ac-
cess
In this section we consider linguistic phenomena
and by extension lexical attributes such as anno-
tations of linguistic phenomena as themselves a
means of access to the collocations in multilin-
gual collocation dictionaries. We illustrate this
approach by describing a bilingual dictionary of
tourism that has been developed with this means
of access in mind.
This dictionary involves the differences be-
tween French-Spanish-French translations found
in ecological, fluvial and cultural (historical and
religious) tourism corpora (Mendez, 1993; Ri-
gole and Langlois, 2002). When translating the
corpora, we noticed the presence of varieties of
languages, such as Latin American Spanish and
common Spanish (that is the Spanish of Spain)
and of regionalisms; for example, in the case of
Panama whose animal and plant specimen names
were used only in that country and not in other
Latin American countries, see Figure 7 (Chan
2005).

We also found cases of linguistic phenomena
at the semantic level, such as Americanisms,
Anglicisms, non-reversible equivalents, etc. To
handle these various observations we developed
an algorithmic dictionary access method in order
to provide access to the relevant collocations and
translations. Our overall algorithm (see Figure 8)
is itself composed of three principle sub-
dictionaries:

The algorithm has a maximum of eight levels
where the existence of other sub-dictionaries (or
sub-algorithms) is possible inside of each dic-
tionary, which itself can be consulted independ-
ently or dependently. In other words, the overall
algorithm includes several mini-algorithms and
mini-dictionaries.
At the start of each consultation, the words be-
longing to a given dictionary are presented in the
form of a list arranged in alphabetical order so
that the user can save time.
We now discuss these three specific sub-
dictionaries.
The first sub-dictionary concerns equivalences
which are provided in the French-Spanish-
French languages and which are classified ac-
cording to topic. The sub-field cultural tourism
presents for example historical and religious
tourism as sub-sub-fields.
The second sub-dictionary concerns particular
cases at the semantic level, the terms of the dic-
tionary of the Panamanian fauna, for example,
are joined together by class such as: insects,
mammals, birds and reptiles. The user can check
starting from:

ish to obtain the equivalences in French
and Latin;
• Latin to obtain the equivalences in
French, common Spanish and Panamanian
Spanish.

<bodyText confidence="0.855214465517242">
At the outset we had the intention to develop a
bilingual dictionary. However, we included Latin
in the dictionary, since, when translating the
Spanish corpora to French, we noticed that the
names of the flora and fauna belonged to a spe-
cialised lexicon and that most of these names
constituted regional variations. Thus, we had to
look for the scientific name (coming from Latin),
then the common Spanish name in bibliographi-
cal documents, monolingual dictionaries or on
Internet sites dedicated to these fields and finally,
to look for the French translation in general bi-
lingual dictionaries (Spanish-French) and on
zoological and botanical websites in order to
validate the equivalences.
We did not consider the variants of other
Latin-American countries because in order to do
so it would have been necessary to undertake an
intensive research exercise into the matter and to
have had the terms checked by specialists in the
field studied.
The third and last sub-dictionary deals with
grammatical findings. It is not only composed of
words but grammatical rules and also examples
in order to illustrate the different cases. For this
reason, we do not mention the quantity of words
in the dictionary but rather the number of sub-
conditions in the algorithm.
The algorithm that we have developed is inter-
actively interpretable by the Studygram system
(Cardey and Greenfield, 1992) which also pro-
vides the user interface. To illustrate the trace of
a user access using our prototype system with the
dictionary access algorithm illustrated in Figure
8, we take as entry the French collocation &apos;ama-
zone à front rouge&apos; and where we are interested
in the equivalences sub-dictionary and the par-
ticular cases sub-dictionary (see Figure 9).

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979051724138">
We have presented the essential linguistic phe-
nomena and the lexicographic requirements that
we have discerned to be useful in the develop-
ment of multilingual collocation dictionaries. By
‘collocation’ we mean not only set or fixed ex-
pressions including idioms, simple co-
occurrences of items and metaphorical uses, but
also translators’ paraphrases. The basic model
for such dictionaries as exemplified in the Mul-
tiCoDiCT system reposes on the concept of the
collocation sense group as a means to ensure in-
tegrity and access. We have presented a novel
access method to such dictionaries using the
Studygram system which in essence provides
access also based on much of the very linguistic
phenomena and related lexicographical attributes
that we have previously discerned and thus ena-
bling access to collocations by posing a problem.
We conclude in showing how Studygram and
MultiCoDiCT can be integrated in order to pro-
vide a more general approach for the access to
such multilingual collocation dictionaries. In this
approach, Studygram would provide the user
interface and problem solving capability as de-
scribed in section 3 and MultiCoDiCT would act
as a lexical resources server.
At one level this approach would involve the
essentially technical matter of standardising the
mutual call mechanism (operational semantics)
between Studygram and MultiCoDiCT. The
Studygram system in any case supports algo-
rithm solutions (called operations) which can be
procedure calls, which in this context would be
to MultiCoDiCT.
At another level this approach would involve
formalising and standardising the linguistic and
lexicographic terminology shared by the two sys-
tems. This level is thus concerned with including
the lexicographical needs in the computational
model. In respect of the semantics of the Multi-
CoDiCT component, the model underpinning
MultiCoDiCT could be extended in a simple
fashion to support explicitly the provision of lin-
guistic ‘headwords’ involving the intrinsically
modelled linguistic phenomena of synonymy and
translation equivalences, polysemy and non-
reversibility of the lexis. Access by conventional
headwords is in any case already supported. The
same MultiCoDiCT model provides annotation
structures attached to the sense group, to the col-
location and to the collocation lexical item.
However the semantics of the annotation content
is the lexicographer’s and thus would involve an
agreed semantics between the MuliCoDiCT and
Stydygram components including the algorithm
content concerning the machine interpretation of
such annotation contents and lexicographic at-
tributes.

<abstract confidence="0.999164107142857">In this paper we discuss the development of a multilingual collocation dictionary for translation purposes. By ‘collocation’ we mean not only set or fixed expressions including idioms, simple cooccurrences of items and metaphorical uses, but also translators’ paraphrases. We approach this problem from two directions. Firstly we identify certain linguistic phenomena and lexicographical requirements that need to be respected in the development of such dictionaries. The second and other direction concerns the development of such dictionaries in which linguistic phenomena and lexicographic attributes are themselves a means of access to the collocations. The linguistic phenomena and lexicographical requirements concern variously placing the sense of collocations rather than headwords or other access methods at the centre of interest, together with collocation synonymy and translation equivalence, polysemy and non-reversibility of the lexis, and other more lexicographic properties such as varieties of language and regionalisms, and types of translation.</abstract>

Furthermore, headword access to a collocation also provides direct access to the other collocations in the dictionary with an equivalent sense (or senses for polysemic collocations). More recently, work on linguistic phenomena and lexicographic attributes based access to collocations (as well as headword access) has resulted in a prototype system using an algorithmic approach (Chan, 2005) using the Studygram system (Cardey and Greenfield, 1992). In the paper we first review the linguistic phenomena and lexicographic requirements that we have discerned for such multilingual collocation dictionaries. We then discuss the development of such dictionaries in which the linguistic phenomena and lexicographic attributes are themselves a means of access to the collocations.

The third and last sub-dictionary deals with grammatical findings. It is not only composed of words but grammatical rules and also examples in order to illustrate the different cases. For this reason, we do not mention the quantity of words in the dictionary but rather the number of subconditions in the algorithm. The algorithm that we have developed is interactively interpretable by the Studygram system (Cardey and Greenfield, 1992) which also provides the user interface. To illustrate the trace of a user access using our prototype system with the dictionary access algorithm illustrated in Figure 8, we take as entry the French collocation &apos;amazone à front rouge&apos; and where we are interested in the equivalences sub-dictionary and the particular cases sub-dictionary (see Figure 9). amazone à front rouge equivalences subdictionary particular cases at the semantic level subdictionary loro m. frente roja nonreversible equivalents collocations amazone f.: amazona f.

When translating the corpora, we noticed the presence of varieties of languages, such as Latin American Spanish and common Spanish (that is the Spanish of Spain) and of regionalisms; for example, in the case of Panama whose animal and plant specimen names were used only in that country and not in other Latin American countries, see Figure 7 (Chan 2005). Common Spanish corozo agutí names PANAMA corozo iieque BOLIVIA totai - CUBA - jutía mocha MEXICO - cotuza VENEZUELA corozo zuliano de grupa negra French translation acrocome / agouti coyol / noix de coyol Figure 7.

The linguistic phenomena and lexicographic requirements are ones that are candidates for modelling such dictionaries using formal methods, for example using the Z formal specification language (Spivey, 1992), the impetus being that certain domains in which such dictionaries are used are safety critical in nature. This has resulted in work in respect of the state invariants peculiar to specialised multilingual collocation based dictionaries (Greenfield, 1998a; Greenfield, 1998b). In response to these various observed linguistic phenomena and lexicographical requirements, the MultiCoDiCT (Multilingual Collocation Dictionary System Centre Tesnière) system was developed as a research aid tool for multilingual lexicographic research (Greenfield et al., 1999; Greenfield, 2003).
