We describe the adaptation for Arabic of
the grammar-based MedSLT medical
speech system. The system supports simple
medical diagnosis questions about head-
aches using vocabulary of 322 words. We
show that the MedSLT architecture based
on motivated general grammars produces
very good results, with a limited effort.
Based on the grammars for other languages
covered by the system, it is in fact very
easy to develop an Arabic grammar and to
specialize it efficiently for the different
system tasks. In this paper, we focus on
generation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999083">
MedSLT is a medical speech translation system. It
allows a doctor to ask diagnosis questions in medi-
cal subdomains, such as headaches, abdominal
pain, etc, covering a wide range of questions that
doctors generally ask their patients. The grammar-
based architecture, built using specialization from
reusable general grammars, is designed to allow a
rapid development of different domains and lan-
guages. Presently, it supports English, French,
Japanese, Spanish and Catalan. This article focuses
on the system development for Arabic.
In general, translation in this context raises two
specific questions: 1) how to achieve recognition
quality that is good enough for translation, and 2)
how to get translations to be as idiomatic as possi-
ble so they can be understood by the patient. For
close languages and domains where accuracy is not
very important (e.g. information requests), it may
be possible to combine a statistical recognizer with
a commercial translation system as it is often done
in commercial tools such as SpokenTranslation
(Seligman and Dillinger, 2006). However, for this
specific application in a multilingual context, this
solution is not applicable at all: even if perfect rec-
ognition were possible (which is far from being the
case), current commercial tools for translating to
Arabic do not guarantee good quality. The domain
dealt with here contains, in fact, many structures
specific to this type of oral dialogue that can not be
handled by these systems. For example, all the
doctor’s interactions with the MedSLT system
consist of questions whose structures differ from
one language to another, with each language hav-
ing its own constraints. Consequently, two types of
errors occur in Arabic translation systems. Either
they do not recognize the interrogative structure as
in example (1), or they produce ungrammatical
sentences by copying the original structure as in
example (2):

Ellipsis is another problem for MT systems.
Many elliptical structures cannot be translated
without context. In example 3, the context is
needed to guarantee adjective agreement.

It is also essential for rules of translation to be
applied consistently. For instance, in MedSLT,
onset is translated by the verb -*7 (dhahara). In
this context, the adjective sudden has to be trans-
lated by an adverb ة9�, (fajatan) (example 4). This
implies that the translation of the ellipsis in the
second utterance needs to change syntactic cate-
gory too. We can wonder to what extent the word-
for-word translation of the elliptical sentence in (4)
can be understood by the patient.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998055">
In addition to that ellipsis can not always be
translated by the same type of ellipsis. Arabic
grammar (Amin, 1982) allows the use of elliptical
structures in cases where there is a semantic link
(!&gt;+-�) referring to the omitted part of the sentence
otherwise the elliptical construction is ambiguous.
In example (3), the use of an adjective alone pre-
sents an ambiguity introducing, therefore, a diffi-
culty in comprehension which can be problematic.
Thus, it is necessary to resort to a more sophisti-
cated approach. We will describe, in the following
part, the architecture on which MedSLT is based.
Then, we will show how it has been adapted to
Arabic.

2 The Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584214285714">
MedSLT is a grammar-based medical speech trans-
lation system which uses the commercial Nuance
speech recognition platform. It has two main fea-
tures (Bouillon et al., 2005). First, all the language
models (for recognition, analysis, generation) are
produced from linguistically motivated, general
unification grammars using the Regulus platform
(Rayner, et al., 2006). First, domain specific unifi-
cation grammars are created from the general
grammar for the different domains of medical di-
agnosis through a trainable corpus-based automatic
grammar specialization process. They are, next,
compiled into Context Free Grammars (CFGs) in a
format suitable for use with the Nuance speech

recognition platform, and into a form needed for a
variant of Semantic Head-driven generation (Shie-
ber et al., 1990). Therefore, the different grammars
needed by the system under this approach are easy
to build and maintain.
This leads us to the second feature. Because
grammar-based speech recognition only produces
competitive results for the sentences covered by
the grammar, the user will need to learn the cover-
age of the system. In order to assist in this, a help
system is included in the system (Starlander et al.,
2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006). The help
system suggests, after each user utterance, similar
utterances covered by the grammar which can be
taken as a model. In order to derive the help sen-
tences, the system performs, in parallel, a statistical
recognition of the input speech. It then compares
the recognition result using an N-gram based met-
ric, against a set of known correct in-coverage
questions to extract the most similar ones. It is in
that way that we introduce some of the robustness
of the statistical systems in the controlled applica-
tion.
Once the sentence recognized, the translation is
interlingua-based. Regulus allows different types
of source representations (Rayner, et al., 2006), but
we have chosen to use the simplest one in order to
facilitate the translation process. It is a flat seman-
tic structure built up by concatenation of word
meanings. For instance, ?6MI yla tly-J y��ul JA (hal
yachtaddou al soudaa inda al qalaq? ‘Q aggra-
vate-3 the headache in the stress’) would be repre-
sented as follows:
[[cause,qalaq],[event,yachtaddou],
[prep_cause,inda],[symptom,soudaa],
[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq],
[voice,active]]
The same formalism is used for the interlingua
which is a standardized version of the most explicit
source English representation. For example, the
interlingua representation of the previous sentence
corresponds to the following structure that can be
paraphrased as follows: « does the pain become
worse when you experience anxiety?»:
[[sc,when],[clause,
[[pronoun,you],
[secondary_symptom,anxiety],
[state,experience],
[tense,present],
[utterance_type,dcl],
[voice,active]]],
[event,become_worse],[symtom,headache],
[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq],
[voice,active]].
Under this approach the translation process only
involves mapping simple structures. This facilitates
the process of translation and the resolution of di-
vergences. This process goes through five stages:
1) source language analysis in order to extract
source representation; 2) ellipsis resolution if nec-
essary; 3) mapping the source structure into the
interlingua; 4) mapping the interlingua into the
target structure and 5) generation of the target lan-
guage in accordance with its own grammar.
We will show next the adequacy of this architec-
ture for translation in Arabic. On the basis of the
grammars already implemented for some lan-
guages covered by the system (French, English,
Spanish, Catalan), it is, in fact, easy to develop a
general Arabic grammar that meets the constraints
of the MedSLT project and to specialize it for the
purposes of speech recognition and generation.
This method produces very good results when
compared to commercial systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985913043478">
Writing unification grammars for speech presents
two requirements. Since it has to be transformed
into context–free grammar (CFG) for recognition,
features must have a finite number of values, as
limited as possible. In practice, this means that at-
tributes can not take complex values and the lexi-
calist approach used in LFG or HPSG cannot be
applied here. For example, subcategorization is not
represented with general rule schemata as in
HPSG. Therefore, syntagmatic rules must be mul-
tiplied for each type of verb (transitive, intransi-
tive, etc.). Even if this first constraint results in a
less elegant and more repetitive grammar, it is not
a limitation to the development of grammars with
the complexity required for such applications.
The grammar is used to constrain the recogni-
tion process, so it needs to include all information
that could improve recognition. For instance,
evaluation has shown that the quality of recogni-
tion decreases considerably when selection restric-
tions are omitted (Rayner, et al., 2006). Thus, in
practice, this means that all Regulus general
grammars include many features for managing this

quite close to romance languages. As it can happen
in Spanish or Catalan, the subject of yes-no
questions in Arabic comes conventionally after the
verb (hal yamtad [al alam]_sujet [�fl) if not

from its initial place (PP, etc.), which becomes
empty, to an initial position (ayna_i tahus bi al
alam [i], � G4* cyأ, ‘where you-feel with the
pain’). To deal with the movement, we use the
standard mechanism of gap threading, introduced
by Pereira (1981). The link between the empty
constituent [i] and the constituent which has been
moved (ayna_i in our example) is possible using
two attributes which are gapsin and gapsout, in-
cluded in all categories related to the movement.
For example, in the following rule, such attributes
indicate that the interrogative element (wh_pp) is
only possible if the sentence (s) contains an empty
pp (indicated by the attribute gapsin=pp_gap):

In comparison with the rest of languages previ-
ously processed by the system, the Arabic gram-
mar does not have a lot of special cases. One rule
specifies that some verb such as “to be” (ن4
(kana), ن(�� (yakun), with the feature sub-
cat=pred(icatif)) can be optional – they can be re-
written in an empty constituent indicated as []:
optional_v:
[sem=[[state,be],[tense,present]],
subcat=pred] --&gt; [].
Rules for numbers are also very complex in or-
der to represent the dual form in addition to the
position of numbers which can change depending
on whether the number is singular: one, for exam-
ple : more than one day yاو م(� �5 -%آأ (akthar min
yawm wahid, ‘more than day one’) and, the third
day KI%�ا م(�Iا (al yawm al thalith, ‘the day the
third’), or plural, for example : more than 3 days,
مliأ !L6L �5 -%آأ (akthar min thalathat ayam, ‘more
than three days’).

4 Grammar specialization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896172413793">
One of the most important advantages of the ap-
proach adopted here is that the general grammar
can be specialized for use in different tasks and
domains, to obtain a useful grammar in each case.
In the case of Arabic, it is possible to perform gen-
eration and recognition directly using the general
grammar described above, since it is not yet very
elaborate. The general grammar is however already
large enough to cause serious efficiency problems,
When compiled for generation, the general gram-
mar overgenerates, as the target structures are flat
and underspecified (they do not include, for exam-
ple, information on numbers or determiners, cf.
examples above). It would be possible to insert
preference rules to force the intended structure, but
this solution is extremely unattractive from a soft-
ware engineering point of view. When compiling
the grammar for recognition, the situation is even
worse. All our experiments on other languages
show that recognizers compiled from general
grammars either perform very poorly (Bouillon et
al 2007), or fail to recognize at all (Rayner et al
2006, section 11.7). As in previous work, we have
attacked these problems by creating specialized
versions of the general Arabic grammar.
In our approach to grammar specialization, do-
main-specific unification grammars are derived
from general ones using the Explanation Based
Learning (EBL) technique (Rayner, et al., 2006).
This corpus-based specialization process is param-
eterized by a training corpus and a set of opera-
tionality criteria. The training corpus, which can be
relatively small, consists of examples of utterances
that should be covered by the domain grammar.
(For Arabic, the current training corpus is about
450 sentences). The sentences of the corpus are
parsed using the general grammar, then those
parses are partitioned into phrases based on the
operationality criteria. Each phrase defined by the
operationality criteria is flattened, producing rules
of a phrasal grammar for the application domain.
The resulting domain-specific grammar has a sub-
set of the coverage of the general grammar and
reduced structural ambiguity. In a generation
grammar, over-generation is virtually eliminated;
specialized recognition grammars typically have
greatly superior recognition due to the reduction in
search space that they provide. In the case of the
Arabic grammar described here, the training cor-
pus is a set of Arabic sentences based on the Eng-
lish reference corpus for the headaches domain.
The operationality criteria are a slightly modified
version of those used for the Romance grammars
discussed in Bouillon et al., 2007.
In previous work, we have described at length
the structural relationships between general gram-
mars, and specialized grammars for recognition
and generation; here, we will briefly summarize

the specialized generation grammar
It is immediately apparent that (1), the parse tree
for the general grammar, is structurally much more
complex than (2) and (3), the trees for the special-
ized grammars. In particular, (1) has several nodes
filled by optional modifiers of various kinds, all of
which are here null; if this grammar is compiled
into a recognizer, all these nodes result in extra
paths in the search space, with a corresponding
loss of efficiency. Both the specialized grammars
flatten out the modifier structure, for example us-
ing learning a set of vp rules which instantiate
only those combinations of modifiers that have
actually been seen in the training corpus.
The difference between the specialized recogni-
tion grammar (2) and the specialized generation
grammar (3) is more subtle. The first thing to con-
sider is that the recognition version needs to con-
tain all the rules required for recognition and
analysis of multiple syntactic variants of the diag-
nosis questions, while the generation one only has
to contain sufficient rules to generate one variant
(ideally, the most correct and idiomatic one) for
each question. An important consequence of this
general principle relates to the treatment of NPs.
The general grammar includes a rule that forms an
NP in a conventional manner from a specifier (id-
dat, koul and al, which has been separated from the
noun), potentially optional, and a noun. This rule
permits a compositional analysis of all the gram-
matical combinations of nouns and articles, which
is also appropriate for the recognition grammar.
For generation, however, the system learns gener-
ally complete (lexicalized) NPs, in order to attach
the appropriate article for each noun on the basis of
the corpus (there is an exception for NPs contain-
ing a number because it is obviously undesirable to
include in the corpus one example of every num-
ber/noun combination). Contrasting (2) and (3), we
see that in (2), the phrase ��ا (al alam, ‘the pain’)
is treated compositionally; in (3), it is a lexicalized
phrase produced by the rule
np --&gt; }SIا (al alam)
Our previous experience with French, English and
Spanish has shown that this method is a good solu-
tion for specialized and limited domains like the
one under study. Articles are difficult to recognize
(they are usually short unstressed words) and to
translate, but the right combinations can easily be
learnt according to the context and subdomain. In
the next section, we show that the specialization
method yields good results in practice when ap-
plied to Arabic.

We clearly can see that translations are good
(Good or Ok) if the sentences are well recog-
nized/analyzed in English, which is very important
for our application (381/408 for T1 (93%),
381/408 for T2 (93%), 379/408 for T3 (92%),
367/408 for T4, (89.9%)). Not analyzed sentences
(21.8%) are those which are not covered by the
English grammar but had to be reformulated in an
existent structure with the help system (see above;
Chatzichrisafis, et al., 2006).
Three sentences only (0.6%) failed at the level
of generation (Not generated sentences), which
shows that the specialized generation grammar is
robust enough for the domain. These sentences
have now to be added in the corpus to be generated
correctly. In other languages, we have indeed no-
ticed that this kind of error disappears after one or
two cycles of evaluation on new data. Not trans-
lated sentences (4%) are mostly caused by spe-
cialized medical terms describing pain (pounding,
throbbing, etc.) that we did not introduce yet be-
cause they need to be validated by Arabic medical
specialists. Here are some examples of Good trans-
lations:

In order to compare our results with commercial
MT systems output, we submitted the first 124
well analyzed sentences to Systran. Among these
translations, 98 were judged as Bad, 6 as Good
and 20 as Ok. What the translator has considered
as bad are the translations that are not in the inter-
rogative form and neither grammatical nor idio-
matic. Consequently they are not understandable.
Here are the first ten translations we have obtained:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926875">
At the present time, it would have been difficult to
use a commercial machine translation system for
Arabic in the context of our application where ac-
curacy is very important. One possibility is thus to
use a more linguistic approach that takes advantage
of the subdomain constraints. This approach is usu-
ally very costly. However we have shown in this
paper that the MedSLT architecture based on mo-
tivated general grammars produces very good re-
sults, with a limited effort. The general grammar
can be developed very easily on the basis of other
languages. The experiments described here show
good results for the Arabic generation grammar.
Our initial anecdotal results with the Arabic recog-
nizer are promising, and we hope to begin evalua-
tion of this component in the near future.

It would be possible to insert preference rules to force the intended structure, but this solution is extremely unattractive from a software engineering point of view. When compiling the grammar for recognition, the situation is even worse. All our experiments on other languages show that recognizers compiled from general grammars either perform very poorly (Bouillon et al 2007), or fail to recognize at all (Rayner et al 2006, section 11.7). As in previous work, we have attacked these problems by creating specialized versions of the general Arabic grammar. In our approach to grammar specialization, domain-specific unification grammars are derived from general ones using the Explanation Based Learning (EBL) technique (Rayner, et al., 2006).

The resulting domain-specific grammar has a subset of the coverage of the general grammar and reduced structural ambiguity. In a generation grammar, over-generation is virtually eliminated; specialized recognition grammars typically have greatly superior recognition due to the reduction in search space that they provide. In the case of the Arabic grammar described here, the training corpus is a set of Arabic sentences based on the English reference corpus for the headaches domain. The operationality criteria are a slightly modified version of those used for the Romance grammars discussed in Bouillon et al., 2007. In previous work, we have described at length the structural relationships between general grammars, and specialized grammars for recognition and generation; here, we will briefly summarize 45 the main points and show a simple example of how they apply to our Arabic grammar.

Therefore, the different grammars needed by the system under this approach are easy to build and maintain. This leads us to the second feature. Because grammar-based speech recognition only produces competitive results for the sentences covered by the grammar, the user will need to learn the coverage of the system. In order to assist in this, a help system is included in the system (Starlander et al., 2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006). The help system suggests, after each user utterance, similar utterances covered by the grammar which can be taken as a model. In order to derive the help sentences, the system performs, in parallel, a statistical recognition of the input speech. It then compares the recognition result using an N-gram based metric, against a set of known correct in-coverage questions to extract the most similar ones.

It then compares the recognition result using an N-gram based metric, against a set of known correct in-coverage questions to extract the most similar ones. It is in that way that we introduce some of the robustness of the statistical systems in the controlled application. Once the sentence recognized, the translation is interlingua-based. Regulus allows different types of source representations (Rayner, et al., 2006), but we have chosen to use the simplest one in order to facilitate the translation process. It is a flat semantic structure built up by concatenation of word meanings. For instance, ?6MI yla tly-J y��ul JA (hal yachtaddou al soudaa inda al qalaq? ‘Q aggravate-3 the headache in the stress’) would be represented as follows: [[cause,qalaq],[event,yachtaddou], [prep_cause,inda],[symptom,soudaa], [tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq], [voice,active]] The same formalism is used for the interlingua which is a standardized version of the most explicit source English representation. For example, the in</context>
<context position="10703" citStr="Rayner, et al., 2006" startWordPosition="1622" endWordPosition="1625">ented with general rule schemata as in HPSG. Therefore, syntagmatic rules must be multiplied for each type of verb (transitive, intransitive, etc.). Even if this first constraint results in a less elegant and more repetitive grammar, it is not a limitation to the development of grammars with the complexity required for such applications. The grammar is used to constrain the recognition process, so it needs to include all information that could improve recognition. For instance, evaluation has shown that the quality of recognition decreases considerably when selection restrictions are omitted (Rayner, et al., 2006). Thus, in practice, this means that all Regulus general grammars include many features for managing this 43 type of constraint. For example, nouns are seman- the pain’). Thus, we can use similar rules applied tically typed; verbal entries contain features to de- to Prodrop and inversion in these languages. Intermine the type of complements according to their version is not dealt with as a type of movement subcategorization, etc. These types are difficult to otherwise it would have obliged us to multiply the define coherently for the general vocabulary but number of features in the grammar.

This article focuses on the system development for Arabic. In general, translation in this context raises two specific questions: 1) how to achieve recognition quality that is good enough for translation, and 2) how to get translations to be as idiomatic as possible so they can be understood by the patient. For close languages and domains where accuracy is not very important (e.g. information requests), it may be possible to combine a statistical recognizer with a commercial translation system as it is often done in commercial tools such as SpokenTranslation (Seligman and Dillinger, 2006). However, for this specific application in a multilingual context, this solution is not applicable at all: even if perfect recognition were possible (which is far from being the case), current commercial tools for translating to Arabic do not guarantee good quality. The domain dealt with here contains, in fact, many structures specific to this type of oral dialogue that can not be handled by these systems. For example, all the doctor’s interactions with the MedSLT system consist of questions whose structures differ from one language to another, with each language having its own constraints. C</context>

Therefore, the different grammars needed by the system under this approach are easy to build and maintain. This leads us to the second feature. Because grammar-based speech recognition only produces competitive results for the sentences covered by the grammar, the user will need to learn the coverage of the system. In order to assist in this, a help system is included in the system (Starlander et al., 2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006). The help system suggests, after each user utterance, similar utterances covered by the grammar which can be taken as a model. In order to derive the help sentences, the system performs, in parallel, a statistical recognition of the input speech. It then compares the recognition result using an N-gram based metric, against a set of known correct in-coverage questions to extract the most similar ones. It is in that way that we introduce some of the robustness of the statistical systems in the controlled application. Once the sentence recognized, the translatio</context>

This implies that the translation of the ellipsis in the second utterance needs to change syntactic category too. We can wonder to what extent the wordfor-word translation of the elliptical sentence in (4) can be understood by the patient. 4) Doctor: was the onset of headaches sudden?

(acute) In addition to that ellipsis can not always be translated by the same type of ellipsis. Arabic grammar (Amin, 1982) allows the use of elliptical structures in cases where there is a semantic link (!&gt;+-�) referring to the omitted part of the sentence otherwise the elliptical construction is ambiguous. In example (3), the use of an adjective alone presents an ambiguity introducing, therefore, a difficulty in comprehension which can be problematic. Thus, it is necessary to resort to a more sophisticated approach. We will describe, in the following part, the architecture on which MedSLT is based. Then, we will show how it has been adapted to Arabic. 2 The Architecture MedSLT is a grammar-based medical speech t</context>
