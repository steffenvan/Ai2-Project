<bodyText confidence="0.999755714285714">
By combining information extraction and re-
cord linkage techniques, we have created a re-
pository of references to attorneys, judges, and
expert witnesses across a broad range of text
sources. These text sources include news,
caselaw, law reviews, Medline abstracts, and
legal briefs among others. We briefly describe
our cross document co-reference resolution al-
gorithm and discuss applications these re-
solved references enable. Among these
applications is one that shows summaries of
relationships chains between individuals based
on their document co-occurrence and cross
document co-references.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828869565217">
Attorneys, judges, and expert witnesses all play
important roles in legal systems. Judges decide
cases. Attorneys handle the legal needs of clients.
Expert witnesses testify about complex facts and
play an ever-increasing part in the settlement of
cases. An important part of an attorney’s prepara-
tion for litigation involves researching the back-
ground of the judge deciding the case, of attorneys
representing the opposing side, and of testifying
experts. To help attorneys with this research need,
we have created a system that automatically links
across documents references to attorneys, judges,
and expert witnesses. These documents include
news articles, caselaw documents, law reviews,
Medline abstracts, and legal briefs among others.
Our method of creating cross document co-
references involves extracting from text MUC type
templates for individuals and matching the tem-
plates to biographical profile records using a
Bayesian based record linkage technique. We have
described this method in detail elsewhere (Dozier
and Haschart, 2000; Dozier et al., 2003) and
briefly describe it in section 2.
The biographical records for attorneys, judges,
and expert witnesses that we use for cross docu-
ment co-reference resolution have been created
through a combination of automatic and manual
techniques. The basis of the biographical records
for attorneys and judges comes from a manually
created professional directory which is itself a
product called the Westlaw Legal Directory. The
biographical records for the expert witnesses were
created through text mining. We have described
the text mining application for creation of the ex-
pert witness database in (Dozier er al., 2003) and
describe it briefly in sections 3 and 4.
A new application we have created from these
cross document references involves creating sum-
maries of relationships between attorneys, judges,
and expert witnesses. This new application is dis-
cussed in section 5.
Since their deployment, these applications have
created automatically over 7 million links between
references to attorneys, judges, and expert wit-
nesses in various document collections and their
respective biographical profiles.

<bodyText confidence="0.999756222222222">
By combining information extraction techniques
with record linkage techniques, we have been able
to resolve cross document references for attorneys,
judges, and expert witnesses. Our basic technique
involves extracting a template record for an indi-
vidual from a text document and matching the tem-
plate record to an authority file record. Figure 1
depicts how extraction and record linkage are
combined to create cross document links.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991894736842">
The extraction portion of our system is similar to
template extraction systems described in the Mes-
sage Understanding Conferences proceedings
(MUC-6, 1995) and elsewhere (Appelt et al.,1993)
(Grishman,1997). Our extraction process relies on
a finite state machine that identifies paragraphs in a
document containing attorney, judge, or expert
names and a semantic parser that extracts from the
paragraphs template information about each indi-
vidual named.
The record linkage portion of our system uses a
Bayesian network to match and link attorney,
judge, and expert templates to biographical re-
cords. This network computes the probability that
a given biographical record matches the same per-
son specified in an extracted template. To com-
pute this match likelihood, we treat first name,
middle name, last name, firm, city, state, court, and
other information as independent pieces of match
evidence. We compute the prior probability of a
match by calculating the probability that a ran-
domly selected biographical record will match a
template. We then compute conditional match
probabilities for each piece of evidence using a
manually tagged training set. For each piece of
evidence, we compute the conditional probability
that a biographical record matches a template when
that piece of evidence matches exactly, matches in
a strong fuzzy way, matches in a weak fuzzy way,
is unknown, or mismatches. We define what we
mean by strong fuzzy and weak fuzzy in (Dozier
and Haschart, 2000) and (Dozier et al., 2003). But
basically we mean that a piece of match evidence
matches in a fuzzy way when it is compatible with
another piece of evidence but does not match ex-
actly.
We compute the match probability score for the
records using the following form of Bayes’ rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.958837">
P(M)P(Ei  |M)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985668">
P(M|E) is the probability that the template and
authority records refer to the same person, given
match evidence E.
P(M) is the prior probability that the reference
records refer to the same person. P(M) is the
prior probability that records do not refer to the
same person.
P(Ei|M) is the conditional probability that the
match variable Ei takes on a particular value given
that the template and authority records match. For
example, if we let E1 stand for middle name match
evidence, the probability that the middle names in
the records match exactly given that the records
themselves match is P(E1=exact|M).
P(Ei|M) is the conditional probability that Ei
takes on a particular value, given that the template
and authority records do not match. For example,
if we let E1 stand for middle name match evidence,
the probability that the middle names in the refer-
ence records match, given that the records them-
selves do not match, is P(E1=exact| M).
A sample caselaw document with highlighted
links to judges and attorneys is shown in figure 2.

biographical record for attorney Gerry Spence.

3 Mining Authority Records From Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998665176470588">
For expert witnesses, we created an expert wit-
ness authority file of some 100,000 profiles, mined
from approximately 300,000 jury verdict and set-
tlement documents, using publicly available pro-
fessional license information, an expertise
taxonomy, and automatic text mining techniques.
This directory can be browsed by area of expertise
as well as by location and name. The profiles are
automatically linked to Medline abstracts, as well
as back to the relevant jury verdict and settlement
documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the largest expert witness directory of its kind and
the first to be built using automatic text mining
techniques.
Figure 4 shows the text mining process we used
to create our authority file of expert witnesses from
jury verdict and settlement documents.

<bodyText confidence="0.983097547619048">
First, we extract references to expert witnesses
from court proceeding documents. In our initial
implementation of the system, we extracted
290,000 reference records to expert witnesses from
300,000 documents. The method of extraction for
these reference records is essentially the same as
the method described in section 2 for template re-
cords. Reference records in fact are template re-
cords for experts.
Second, we merge the expert witness reference
records together to create an expert witness profile
file in which each particular expert is listed only
once. Section 4 describes the merging process in
more detail.
Third, we add professional license information
into the expert witness profile records. These re-
cords include license information from the Drug
Enforcement Agency, which licenses health care
professionals to prescribe drugs, and from various
other professional licensing agencies. To deter-
mine whether a license record and expert record
refer to the same person, we again apply Bayesian
based record linkage. The evidence we use to
match license records to profiles includes first
name, middle name, last name, name suffix, city-
state information, area of expertise, and name rar-
ity.
Fourth, we automatically assign each expert wit-
ness record one or more classification categories in
an expertise taxonomy.
Finally, we link court documents and Medline
abstracts to expert witness profile records using
Bayesian based record linkage for a third and
fourth time.
Figure 5 below shows a jury verdict and settle-
ment document. Note that the reference to expert
witness oncologist Arthur Ablin is highlighted.
Figure 6 shows the authority file record for Arthur
Ablin to which the hypertext link in the jury ver-
dict and settlement document is linked. Figure 7
shows the cases Dr. Ablin has testified in as well
as Medline articles Dr. Ablin has authored.

4 Merging Reference Records to Create
Authority File
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989928571429">
To create our directory of expert profiles (i.e.,
expert authority file) from expert reference re-
cords, we need to create a set of records that list a
particular expert one and only one time. This
means we need to merge together all the reference
records that pertain to each individual.
As a first step in merging the expert reference
records, we group the reference records into sets in
which each record in a group shares a common last
name. By doing this, we avoid the computational
cost of comparing every expert witness reference
record to every other reference record.
To merge expert references together within the
groups, we use the following greedy algorithm:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9916866">
1. Select an unmerged expert reference record from
the group. Create an expert authority record from
this record. Mark the expert reference record as
merged.
2. Compare the new expert authority record to each
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.898612333333333">
unmerged reference record in the group. In each
comparison, compute the probability that the ex-
pert in the authority record refers to the same indi-
vidual referenced in the reference record. Use
Bayesian matching to compute this match probabi-
lity. If the match probability exceeds a match
threshold, mark the reference record as “merged”.
Note that the match threshold probability is deter-
mined empirically from training data.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8014585">
3. If any unmerged records remain in the group,
then return to step 1 else halt.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707083333333">
Note that, at this stage, it is still possible for
there to be duplicate records in the authority file, if
two or more reference records pertain to the same
individual but have variant last name spellings.
While this is not common, it can happen when a
source document contains a misspelled last name.
To address this situation, we make a final pass over
the merged authority file and flag record pairs for
manual review when the last names of two records
are separated from each other by an edit distance
of two or less and when the records match in all
other respects.

6 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98819123255814">
Our cross document co-reference resolution
method works by attaching a person referenced in
a document to a profile record that stands for a
unique real world person outside the frame of the
document. Person references from multiple
documents that attach to the same profile are re-
solved by this common attachment.
In the case of attorneys and judges, we used an
existing directory of attorneys and judges as the
source of our profile records. In the case of ex-
perts, we created profiles by mining references
from highly structured and trustworthy documents
such as jury verdict and settlement documents and
professional license records.
When more than one person in a single docu-
ment can be attached to individual profiles and the
relationship between the references in the docu-
ment can be also extracted, then a relationship re-
cord can also be created outside the frame of the
document and these relationships can then be
chained together to generate relational inferences.
This is the technology we are currently exploring
within the legal domain and beyond.
There is a popular belief that between any two
people, there are around six degrees of separation
or less. Although (Dodds et al., 2003) and
(Travers and Milgram, 1969) provide some em-
pirical evidence in support of this theory, the popu-
larity of the theory spawns more from a popular
trivia game in which you attempt to find a path to
Kevin Bacon from any Hollywood star through co-
starring roles (see oracleofbacon.org for an on-line
demo).
Using the database of links built from cross
document co-reference resolution on legal docu-
ments, a similar technique could be used to find
paths of co-occurrence between arbitrary pairs of
U. S. legal professionals. Although we do not pic-
ture any popular party games developing from this,
such techniques could prove useful for activities
such as detecting conflicts of interest among peo-
ple working on a legal matter.

We have described the precision and recall of the
programs that create cross document co-references
for attorneys and judges in (Dozier and Haschart,
2000) and that create co-references for experts in
(Dozier et al., 2003). In general, for collections in
which documents reference people within stereo-
typical syntax, attach location and job type infor-
mation to the person, and usually include the
person’s full first name (e.g., attorney names and
expert witness names in caselaw), we typically
achieve better than 0.98 precision and better than
0.95 recall. For collections in which documents do
not give full name or do not have highly stereo-
typical syntax, the precision and recall perform-
ance is worse. For example, when tagging expert
witness references in Medline, where an author’s
first initial is given in place of the full form of the
first name and the author’s job type must be in-
ferred from the topic of the scientific article, we
currently achieve precision of better than 0.95 and
recall of around 0.60.

We have described this method in detail elsewhere (Dozier and Haschart, 2000; Dozier et al., 2003) and briefly describe it in section 2. The biographical records for attorneys, judges, and expert witnesses that we use for cross document co-reference resolution have been created through a combination of automatic and manual techniques. The basis of the biographical records for attorneys and judges comes from a manually created professional directory which is itself a product called the Westlaw Legal Directory. The biographical records for the expert witnesses were created through text mining. We have described the text mining application for creation of the expert witn</context>

We compute the prior probability of a match by calculating the probability that a randomly selected biographical record will match a template. We then compute conditional match probabilities for each piece of evidence using a manually tagged training set. For each piece of evidence, we compute the conditional probability that a biographical record matches a template when that piece of evidence matches exactly, matches in a strong fuzzy way, matches in a weak fuzzy way, is unknown, or mismatches. We define what we mean by strong fuzzy and weak fuzzy in (Dozier and Haschart, 2000) and (Dozier et al., 2003). But basically we mean that a piece of match evidence matches in a fuzzy way when it is compatible with another piece of evidence but does not match exactly. We compute the match probability score for the records using the following form of Bayes’ rule: P(M)P(Ei |M) P(M|E) is the probability that the template and authority records refer to the same person, given match evidence E. P(M) is the prior probability that the reference records refer to the same person. P(M) is the prior probability that records do not refer to the same person. P(Ei|M) is the conditional pr</context>

Rehnquist We have described the precision and recall of the programs that create cross document co-references for attorneys and judges in (Dozier and Haschart, 2000) and that create co-references for experts in (Dozier et al., 2003). In general, for collections in which documents reference people within stereotypical syntax, attach location and job type information to the person, and usually include the person’s full first name (e.g., attorney names and expert witness names in caselaw), we typically achieve better than 0.98 precision and better than 0.95 recall. For collections in which documents do not give full name or do not have highly stereotypical syntax, the precision and recall performance is worse. For example, when tagging expert witness referen</context>

When more than one person in a single document can be attached to individual profiles and the relationship between the references in the document can be also extracted, then a relationship record can also be created outside the frame of the document and these relationships can then be chained together to generate relational inferences. This is the technology we are currently exploring within the legal domain and beyond. There is a popular belief that between any two people, there are around six degrees of separation or less. Although (Dodds et al., 2003) and (Travers and Milgram, 1969) provide some empirical evidence in support of this theory, the popularity of the theory spawns more from a popular trivia game in which you attempt to find a path to Kevin Bacon from any Hollywood star through costarring roles (see oracleofbacon.org for an on-line demo). Using the database of links built from cross document co-reference resolution on legal documents, a similar technique could be used to find paths of co-occurrence between arbitrary pairs of U. S. legal professionals. Although we do not picture any popular party games developing from this, such techniques could prove useful fo</context>
