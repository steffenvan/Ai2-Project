Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999766923076923">
Optimizing the production, maintenance
and extension of lexical resources is one
the crucial aspects impacting Natural
Language Processing (NLP). A second
aspect involves optimizing the process
leading to their integration in applica-
tions. With this respect, we believe that
the production of a consensual specifica-
tion on multilingual lexicons can be a
useful aid for the various NLP actors.
Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO-
24613) is to define a standard for lexi-
cons that covers multilingual data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999594909090909">
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) is a model
that provides a common standardized framework
for the construction of Natural Language Proc-
essing (NLP) lexicons. The goals of LMF are to
provide a common model for the creation and
use of lexical resources, to manage the exchange
of data between and among these resources, and
to enable the merging of a large number of indi-
vidual electronic resources to form extensive
global electronic resources.
Types of individual instantiations of LMF can
include monolingual, bilingual or multilingual
lexical resources. The same specifications are to
be used for both small and large lexicons. The
descriptions range from morphology, syntax,
semantic to translation information organized as
different extensions of an obligatory core pack-
age. The model is being developed to cover all
natural languages. The range of targeted NLP
applications is not restricted. LMF is also used to
model machine readable dictionaries (MRD),
which are not within the scope of this paper.

2 History and current context
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930923076923">
In the past, this subject has been studied and de-
veloped by a series of projects like GENELEX
[Antoni-Lay], EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE,
SIMPLE, ISLE and MILE [Bertagna]. More re-
cently within ISO1 the standard for terminology
management has been successfully elaborated by
the sub-committee three of ISO-TC37 and pub-
lished under the name &amp;quot;Terminology Markup
Framework&amp;quot; (TMF) with the ISO-16642 refer-
ence. Afterwards, the ISO-TC37 National dele-
gations decided to address standards dedicated to
NLP. These standards are currently elaborated as
high level specifications and deal with word
segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations
(ISO 24611, 24612 and 24615), feature struc-
tures (ISO 24610), and lexicons (ISO 24613)
with this latest one being the focus of the current
paper. These standards are based on low level
specifications dedicated to constants, namely
data categories (revision of ISO 12620), lan-
guage codes (ISO 639), script codes
(ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166), dates
(ISO 8601) and Unicode (ISO 10646).
This work is in progress. The two level organiza-
tion will form a coherent family of standards
with the following simple rules:

tural elements that are adorned by the standard-
ized constants.
In other words, LMF is mainly focused on the
linguistic representation of lexical information.

3 Scope and challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989559">
The task of designing a lexicon model that satis-
fies every user is not an easy task. But all the
efforts are directed to elaborate a proposal that
fits the major needs of most existing models.
In order to summarise the objectives, let&apos;s see
what is in the scope and what is not.
LMF addresses the following difficult chal-
lenges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998912529411765">
• Represent words in languages where
multiple orthographies (native scripts or
transliterations) are possible, e.g. some
Asian languages.
• Represent explicitly (i.e. in extension)
the morphology of languages where a de-
scription of all inflected forms (from a list
of lemmatised forms) is manageable, e.g.
English.
• Represent the morphology of languages
where a description in extension of all in-
flected forms is not manageable (e.g. Hun-
garian). In this case, representation in in-
tension is the only manageable issue.
• Easily associate written forms and spo-
ken forms for all languages.
• Represent complex agglutinating com-
pound words like in German.
• Represent fixed, semi-fixed and flexible
multiword expressions.
• Represent specific syntactic behaviors,
as in the Eagles recommendations.
• Allow complex argument mapping be-
tween syntax and semantic descriptions, as
in the Eagles recommendations.
• Allow a semantic organisation based on
SynSets (like in WordNet) or on semantic
predicates (like in FrameNet).
• Represent large scale multilingual re-
sources based on interlingual pivots or on
transfer linking.
LMF does not address the following topics:
• General sentence grammar of a language
• World knowledge representation

4 Key standards used by LMF
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954131722222222">
LMF utilizes Unicode in order to represent the
orthographies used in lexical entries regardless of
language.
Linguistic constants, like /feminine/ or
/transitive/, are not defined within LMF but are
specified in the Data Category Registry (DCR)
that is maintained as a global resource by
ISO TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-
3:2003.
The LMF specification complies with the
modeling principles of Unified Modeling Lan-
guage (UML) as defined by OMG2 [Rumbaugh
2004]. A model is specified by a UML class dia-
gram within a UML package: the class name is
not underlined in the diagrams. The various ex-
amples of word description are represented by
UML instance diagrams: the class name is under-
lined.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.817684" genericHeader="method">
5 Structure and core package
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959766857142857">
LMF is comprised of two components:
1) The core package consists of a structural
skeleton that describes the basic hierarchy of in-
formation in a lexical entry.
2) Extensions to the core package are ex-
pressed in a framework that describes the reuse
of the core components in conjunction with addi-
tional components required for the description of
the contents of a specific lexical resource.
In the core package, the class called Database
represents the entire resource and is a container
for one or more lexicons. The Lexicon class is
the container for all the lexical entries of the
same language within the database. The Lexicon
Information class contains administrative infor-
mation and other general attributes. The Lexical
Entry class is a container for managing the top
level language components. As a consequence,
the number of representatives of single words,
multi-word expressions and affixes of the lexicon
is equal to the number of lexical entries in a
given lexicon. The Form and Sense classes are
parts of the Lexical Entry. Form consists of a text
string that represents the word. Sense specifies or
identifies the meaning and context of the related
form. Therefore, the Lexical Entry manages the
relationship between sets of related forms and
their senses. If there is more than one orthogra-

phy for the word form (e.g. transliteration) the
Form class may be associated with one to many
Representation Frames, each of which contains a
specific orthography and one to many data cate-
gories that describe the attributes of that orthog-
raphy.
The core package classes are linked by the re-
lations as defined in the following UML class

A subset of the core package classes are ex-
tended to cover different kinds of linguistic data.
All extensions conform to the LMF core package
and cannot be used to represent lexical data in-
dependently of the core package. From the point
of view of UML, an extension is a UML pack-
age. Current extensions for NLP dictionaries are:
NLP Morphology3, NLP inflectional paradigm,
NLP Multiword Expression pattern, NLP Syntax,
NLP Semantic and Multilingual notations, which
is the focus of this paper.

6.1 Considerations for standardizing multi-
lingual data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982377805555555">
The simplest configuration of multilingual
data is a bilingual lexicon where a single link is
used to represent the translation of a given
form/sense pair from one language into another.
But a survey of actual practices clearly reveals
other requirements that make the model more
complex. Consequently, LMF has focused on the
following ones:
(i) Cases where the relation 1-to-1 is impos-
sible because of lexical differences among lan-
guages. An example is the case of English word
“river” that relates to French words “rivière” and
“fleuve”, where the latter is used for specifying
that the referent is a river that flows into the sea.
The bilingual lexicon should specify how these
units relate.
(ii) The bilingual lexicon approach should
be optimized to allow the easiest management of
large databases for real multilingual scenarios. In
order to reduce the explosion of links in a multi-
bilingual scenario, translation equivalence can be
managed through an intermediate &amp;quot;Axis&amp;quot;. This
object can be shared in order to contain the num-
ber of links in manageable proportions.
(iii) The model should cover both transfer
and pivot approaches to translation, taking also
into account hybrid approaches. In LMF, the
pivot approach is implemented by a “Sense
Axis”. The transfer approach is implemented by
a “Transfer Axis”.
(iv) A situation that is not very easy to deal
with is how to represent translations to languages
that are similar or variants. The problem arises,
for instance, when the task is to represent transla-
tions from English to both European Portuguese
and Brazilian Portuguese. It is difficult to con-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.991921285714286">
5 To be more precise, Papillon uses the term &amp;quot;axie&amp;quot;
from &amp;quot;axis&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lexie&amp;quot;. In the beginning of the LMF
project, we used the term &amp;quot;axie&amp;quot; but after some bad
comments about using a non-English term in a stan-
dard, we decided to use the term &amp;quot;axis&amp;quot;.
sider them as two separate languages. In fact, one
is a variant of the other. The differences are mi-
nor: a certain number of words are different and
some limited phenomena in syntax are different.
Instead of managing two distinct copies, it is
more effective to manage one lexicon with some
objects that are marked with a dialectal attribute.
Concerning the translation from English to Por-
tuguese: a limited number of specific Axis in-
stances record this variation and the vast major-
ity of Axis instances is shared.
(v) The model should allow for representing
the information that restricts or conditions the
translations. The representation of tests that
combine logical operations upon syntactic and
semantic features must be covered.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992731">
6.2 Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9973737">
The model is based on the notion of Axis that
link Senses, Syntactic Behavior and examples
pertaining to different languages. Axis can be
organized at the lexicon manager convenience in
order to link directly or indirectly objects of dif-
ferent languages. A direct link is implemented by
a single axis. An indirect link is implemented by
several axis and one or several relations.
The model is based on three main classes:
Sense Axis, Transfer Axis, Example Axis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998752">
6.3 Sense Axis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982">
Sense Axis is used to link closely related
senses in different languages, under the same
assumptions of the interlingual pivot approach,
and, optionally, it can also be used to refer to one
or several external knowledge representation sys-
tems.
The use of the Sense Axis facilitates the repre-
sentation of the translation of words that do not
necessarily have the same valence or morpho-
logical form in one language than in another. For
example, in a language, we can have a single
word that will be translated by a compound word
into another language: English “wheelchair” to
Spanish “silla de ruedas”. Sense Axis may have
the following attributes: a label, the name of an
external descriptive system, a reference to a spe-
cific node inside an external description.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994176">
6.4 Sense Axis Relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99914625">
Sense Axis Relation permits to describe the
linking between two different Sense Axis in-
stances. The element may have attributes like
label, view, etc.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995018">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947125">
The label enables the coding of simple inter-
lingual relations like the specialization of
“fleuve” compared to “rivière” and “river”. It is
not, however, the goal of this strategy to code a
complex system for knowledge representation,
which ideally should be structured as a complete
coherent system designed specifically for that
purpose.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970895">
6.5 Transfer Axis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999656">
Transfer Axis is designed to represent multi-
lingual transfer approach. Here, linkage refers to
information contained in syntax. For example,
this approach enables the representation of syn-
tactic actants involving inversion, such as (1):

eng:“I miss her”

<bodyText confidence="0.93798875">
Due to the fact that a lexical entry can be a
support verb, it is possible to represent transla-
tions that start from a plain verb to a support verb
like (2) that means &amp;quot;Mary dreams&amp;quot;:

some local exceptions, the goal is to avoid a full
and dummy duplication. For instance, the nomi-
native forms of the third person clitics are largely
preferred in Brazilian rather than the oblique
form as in European Portuguese. The transfer
axis relations hold a label to distinguish which
axis to use depending on the target object.

<bodyText confidence="0.999812444444445">
A serious comparison with previously existing
models is not possible in this current paper due
to the lack of space. We advice the interested
colleague to consult the technical report &amp;quot;Ex-
tended examples of lexicons using LMF&amp;quot; located
at: &amp;quot;http://lirics.loria.fr&amp;quot; in the document area.
The report explains how to use LMF in order to
represent OLIF-2, Parole/Clips, LC-Star, Word-
Net, FrameNet and BDéf.

10 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999652461538461">
In this paper we presented the results of the
ongoing research activity of the LMF ISO stan-
dard. The design of a common and standardized
framework for multilingual lexical databases will
contribute to the optimization of the use of lexi-
cal resources, specially their reusability for dif-
ferent applications and tasks. Interoperability is
the condition of a effective deployment of usable
lexical resources.
In order to reach a consensus, the work done
has paid attention to the similarities and differ-
ences of existing lexicons and the models behind
them.

<abstract confidence="0.997065642857143">Optimizing the production, maintenance and extension of lexical resources is one the crucial aspects impacting Natural Language Processing (NLP). A second aspect involves optimizing the process leading to their integration in applications. With this respect, we believe that the production of a consensual specification on multilingual lexicons can be a useful aid for the various NLP actors. Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO- 24613) is to define a standard for lexicons that covers multilingual data.</abstract>
