In Dutch dialectology the Reeks Nederlandse Dia-
lectatlassen (RND), compiled by Blancquaert &amp;
Pée (1925-1982) is an invaluable data source. The
atlases cover the Dutch language area. The Dutch
area comprises The Netherlands, the northern part
of Belgium (Flanders), a smaller northwestern part
of France, and the German county of Bentheim.
The RND contains 1956 varieties, which can be
found in 16 volumes. For each dialect 139 sen-
tences are translated and transcribed in phonetic
script. Blancquaert mentions that the questionnaire
used for this atlas was conceived of as a range of
sentences with words that illustrate particular
sounds. The design was such that, e.g., various
changes of older Germanic vowels, diphthongs and
consonants are represented in the questionnaire
(Blancquaert 1948, p. 13). We exploit here the his-
torical information in this atlas.
The goals of this paper are twofold. First we aim
to reconstruct a ‘proto-language’ on the basis of
the RND dialect material and see how close we
come to the protoforms found in Gerhard Köbler’s
neuhochdeutsch-germanisches Wörterbuch
(Köbler, 2003). We recognize that we actually re-
construct a stage that would never have existed in
prehistory. In practice, however, we are usually
forced to use incomplete data, since data collec-
tions -- such as the RND – are restricted by politi-
cal boundaries, and often some varieties are lost.
In this paper we show the usefulness of a data
source like the RND.
Second we want to measure the divergence of
Dutch dialects compared to their proto-language.
We measure the divergence of the dialect pronun-
ciations. We do not measure the number of
changes that happened in the course of time. For

In this paper we use the Reeks Nederlandse
Dialectatlassen as a source for the recon-
struction of a ‘proto-language’ of Dutch
dialects. We used 360 dialects from loca-
tions in the Netherlands, the northern part
of Belgium and French-Flanders. The den-
sity of dialect locations is about the same
everywhere. For each dialect we recon-
structed 85 words. For the reconstruction of
vowels we used knowledge of Dutch his-
tory, and for the reconstruction of conso-
nants we used well-known tendencies
found in most textbooks about historical
linguistics. We validated results by com-
paring the reconstructed forms with pro-
nunciations according to a proto-Germanic
dictionary (Köbler, 2003). For 46% of the
words we reconstructed the same vowel or
the closest possible vowel when the vowel
to be reconstructed was not found in the
dialect material. For 52% of the words all
consonants we reconstructed were the
same. For 42% of the words, only one con-
sonant was differently reconstructed. We
measured the divergence of Dutch dialects
from their ‘proto-language’. We measured
pronunciation distances to the proto-
language we reconstructed ourselves and
correlated them with pronunciation dis-
tances we measured to proto-Germanic
based on the dictionary. Pronunciation dis-
tances were measured using Levenshtein
distance, a string edit distance measure. We
found a relatively strong correlation
(r=0.87).

example if a [u] changed into a [y] and then the [y]
changed into a [u], we simply compare the [u] to
the proto-language pronunciation. However, we do
compare Dutch dialects to both the proto-language
we reconstruct ourselves, which we call Proto-
Language Reconstructed (PLR), and to the Proto-
language according to the proto-Germanic Dic-
tionary, which we call Proto-Germanic according
to the Dictionary (PGD).

2 Reconstructing the proto-language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975952380952">
From the nearly 2000 varieties in the RND we
selected 360 representative dialects from locations
in the Dutch language area. The density of
locations is about the same everywhere.
In the RND, the same 141 sentences are trans-
lated and transcribed in phonetic script for each
dialect. Since digitizing the phonetic texts is time-
consuming on the one hand, and since our proce-
dure for measuring pronunciation distances is a
word-based method on the other hand, we initially
selected from the text only 125 words. Each set
represents a set of potential cognates, inasmuch as
they were taken from translations of the same sen-
tence in each case. In Köbler’s dictionary we found
translations of 85 words only; therefore our analy-
ses are based on those 85 words.
We use the comparative method (CM) as the
main tool for reconstructing a proto-form on the
basis of the RND material. In the following sub-
sections we discuss the reconstruction of vowels
and consonants respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974015">
2.1 Vowels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989507341463414">
For the reconstruction of vowels we used knowl-
edge about sound developments in the history of
Dutch. In Old Dutch the diphthongs /~Y and /au/
turned into monophthongs /e:/ and /o:/ respectively
(Quak &amp; van der Horst 2002, p. 32). Van Bree
(1996) mentions the tendencies that lead /e:/ and
/o:/ to change into /i:/ and /u:/ respectively. From
these data we find the following chains:
ai  ei  e  i
au  ou  o  u
An example is twee ‘two’ which has the vowel
[a] in 11% of the dialects, the [e] in 14% of the
dialects, the [e] in 43% of the dialects and the [i] in
20% of the dialects. 1 According to the neu-
hochdeutsch-germanisches Wörterbuch the [a] or
[ai] is the original sound. Our data show that sim-
ply reconstructing the most frequent sound, which
is the [e], would not give the original sound, but
using the chain the original sound is easily found.
To get evidence that the /ai/ has raised to /e/
(and probably later to /i/) in a particular word, we
need evidence that the /e/ was part of the chain.
Below we discuss another chain where the /i/ has
lowered to /ai/, and where the /e/ is missing in the
chain. To be sure that the /e/ was part of the chain,
we consider the frequency of the /e/, i.e. the num-
ber of dialects with /e/ in that particular word. The
frequency of /e/ should be higher than the fre-
quency of /e/ and/or higher than the frequency of
/i/. Similarly for the change from /au/ to /o/ we
consider the frequency of /o/.
Another development mentioned by Van Bree is
that high monophthongs diphthongize. In the tran-
sition from middle Dutch to modern Dutch, the
monophthong /i:/ changed into /ei/, and the mo-
nophthong /y:/ changed into either /ary/ or /oi/
(Van der Wal, 1994). According to Van Bree
(1996, p. 99), diphthongs have the tendency to
lower. This can be observed in Polder Dutch where
/ei/ and /cry/ are lowered to /~Y and /au/ (Stroop
1998). We recognize the following chains:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.935521333333333">
i  ei  ai
y  wy/oi  au
u  ou  au
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999747625">
Different from the chains mentioned above, we
do not find the /e/ and /o/ respectively in these
chains. To get evidence for these chains, the fre-
quency of /e/ should be lower than both the fre-
quency of /e/ and /i/, and the frequency of /o/
should be lower than both /o/ and /u/.
Sweet (1888, p. 20) observes that vowels have
the tendency to move from back to front. Back

diphthongs.

vowels favour rounding, and front vowels un-
rounding. From this, we derive five chains:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9963712">
i  y  u
I  Y  U
e  0  o
e  W  o
a    cl
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849258064516">
However, unrounded front vowels might be-
come rounded under influence from a labial or
labiodental consonant. For example vijf ‘five’ is
sometimes pronounced as [vif] and sometimes as
[vyf]. The [i] has been changed into [y] under in-
fluence of the labiodental [v] and [f].
Sweet (1888, p. 22) writes that the dropping of
unstressed vowels is generally preceded by various
weakenings in the direction of a vowel close to
schwa. In our data we found that the word mijn
‘my’ is sometimes [i] and sometimes [a]. A non-
central unstressed vowel might change into a cen-
tral vowel which in turn might be dropped. In gen-
eral we assume that deletion of vowels is more
likely than insertion of vowels.
Most words in our data have one syllable. For
each word we made an inventory of the vowels
used across the 360 varieties. We might recognize
a chain in the data on the basis of vowels which
appear at least two times in the data. For 37 words
we could apply the tendencies mentioned above. In
the other cases, we reconstruct the vowel by using
the vowel found most frequently among the 360
varieties, working with Occam’s Razor as a guid-
ing principle. When both monophthongs and diph-
thongs are found among the data, we choose the
most frequent monophthong. Sweet (1888, p. 21)
writes that isolative diphthongizaton “mainly af-
fects long vowels, evidently because of the diffi-
culty of prolonging the same position without
change.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993043">
2.2 Consonants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98092675">
For the reconstruction of consonants we used ten
tendencies which we discuss one by one below.
Initial and medial voiceless obstruents become
voiced when (preceded and) followed by a voiced
sound. Hock &amp; Joseph (1996) write that weakening
(or lenition) “occurs most commonly in a medial
voiced environment (just like Verner’s law), but
may be found in other contexts as well.” In our
data set zes ‘six’ is pronounced with a initial [z] in
most cases and with an initial [s] in the dialects of
Stiens and Dokkum. We reconstructed [s].2
Final voiced obstruents of an utterance become
voiceless. Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natu-
ral isolative tendency is to change voice into un-
voiced. He also writes that the “tendency to un-
voicing is shown most strongly in the stops.” Hock
&amp; Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that final devoicing
“is not confined to utterance-final position but ap-
plies word-finally as well.”3 In our data set we
found that for example the word-final consonant
in op ‘on’ is sometimes a [p] and sometimes a [b].
Based on this tendency, we reconstruct the [b].
Plosives become fricatives between vowels, be-
fore vowels or sonorants (when initial), or after
vowels (when final). Sweet writes that the “opening
of stops generally seems to begin between vow-
els...” (p. 23). Somewhat further he writes that in
Dutch the g has everywhere become a fricative
while in German the initial g remained a stop. For
example goed ‘good’ is pronounced as [gu-at] in
Frisian dialects, while other dialects have initial [y]
or [x]. Following the tendency, we consider the [g]
to be the older sound. Related to this is the pronun-
ciation of words like schip ‘ship’ and school
‘school’. As initial consonants we found [sk], [sx]
and [f]. In cases like this we consider the [sk] as
the original form, although the [k] is not found be-
tween vowels, but only before a vowel.
Oral vowels become nasalized before nasals.
Sweet (1888) writes that “nothing is more common
than the nasalizing influence of a nasal on a pre-
ceding vowels” and that there “is a tendency to
drop the following nasal consonant as superfluous”
when “the nasality of a vowel is clearly developed”
and “the nasal consonant is final, or stands before
another consonant.” (p. 38) For example gaan ‘to
go’ is pronounced as [gcl:n] in the dialect of Dok-
2 In essence, in this and other such cases, a version of
the manuscript-editing principle of choosing the
“lectio difficilior” was our guiding principle.
3 We do feel, however, that word-final devoicing, even
though common cross-linguistically, is, as Hock
1976 emphasizes, not phonetically determined but
rather reflects the generalization of utterance-final
developments into word-final position, owing to the
overlap between utterance-finality and word-finality.

kum, and as [g6-5] in the dialect of Stiens. The na-
salized [6-&apos;] in the pronunciation of Stiens already
indicates the deletion of a following nasal.
Consonants become palatalized before front
vowels. According to Campbell (2004) “palataliza-
tion often takes place before or after i and j or be-
fore other front vowels, depending on the lan-
guage, although unconditioned palatalization can
also take place.” An example might be vuur which
is pronounced like [fjuar] in Frisian varieties,
while most other varieties have initial [f] or [v]
followed by [i] or [y].
Superfluous sounds are dropped. Sweet (1888)
introduced this principle as one of the principles of
economy (p. 49). He especially mentioned that in
[%] the superfluous [g] is often dropped (p. 42). In
our data we found that krom ‘curved’ is pro-
nounced [kru-rn] in most cases, but as [kru-rnp] in
the dialect of Houthalen. In the reconstructed form
we posit the final [p].
Medial [h] deletes between vowels, and initial
[h] before vowels. The word hart ‘heart’ is some-
times pronounced with and sometimes without ini-
tial [h]. According to this principle we reconstruct
the [h].
[r] changes to [x]. According to Hock and Jo-
seph (1996) the substitution of uvular [R] for trilled
(post-)dental [r] is an example of an occasional
change apparently resulting from misperception. In
the word rijp ‘ripe’ we find initial [r] in most cases
and [R] in the dialects of Echt and Baelen. We re-
constructed [r].
Syllable initial [w] changes in [v]. Under ‘Lip
to Lip-teeth’ Sweet (1888) writes that in “the
change of p into f, w into v, we may always assume
an intermediate [�], [P], the latter being the Mid-
dle German w“ (p. 26), and that the “loss of back
modification is shown in the frequent change of
(w) into (v) through [P], as in Gm.” Since v –
meant as “voiced lip-to-teeth fricative” – is close to
[u] – lip-to-teeth sonorant – we reconstruct [w] if
both [w] and [u] are found in the dialect pronuncia-
tions. This happens for example in the word wijn
‘wine’.
The cluster ol+d/t diphthongizes to ou + d/t. For
example English old and German alt have a /l/ be-
fore the /d/ and /t/ respectively. In Old Dutch ol
changed into ou (Van Loey 1967, p. 43, Van Bree
1987, p. 135/136). Therefore we reconstruct the /l/
with preceding /o/ or /a/.

3 The proto-language according to the
dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99804465">
The dictionary of Köbler (2003) provides Ger-
manic proto-forms. In our Dutch dialect data set
we have transcriptions of 125 words per dialect.
We found 85 words in the dictionary. Other words
were missing, especially plural nouns, and verb
forms other than infinitives are not included in this
dictionary.
For most words, many proto-Germanic forms
are given. We used the forms in italics only since
these are the main forms according to the author. If
different lexical forms are given for the same
word, we selected only variants of those lexical
forms which appear in standard Dutch or in one of
the Dutch dialects.
The proto-forms are given in a semi-phonetic
script. We converted them to phonetic script in
order to make them as comparable as possible to
the existing Dutch dialect transcriptions. This ne-
cessitated some interpretation. We made the fol-
lowing interpretation for monophthongs:

Lehmann (2005-2007) writes that in the early
stage of Proto-Germanic “each of the obstruents
had the same pronunciation in its various
locations...”. “Later, /b d g/ had fricative
allophones when medial between vowels.
Lehmann (1994) writes that in Gothic “/b, d, g/
has stop articulation initially, finally and when
doubled, fricative articulation between vowels.”
We adopted this scheme, but were restricted by the
RND consonant set. The fricative articulation of
/b/ would be [P] or [v]. We selected the [v] since
this sound is included in the RND set. The fricative
articulation of /d/ would be [d], but this consonant
is not in the RND set. We therefore used the [d]
which we judge perceptually to be closer to the [d]
than to the [z]. The fricative articulation of /g/ is
/y/ which was available in the RND set.
We interpreted the h as [h] in initial position,
and as [x] in medial and final positions. An n be-
fore k, g or h is interpreted as [g], and as [n] in all
other cases. The should actually be interpreted as
[0], but this sound in not found in the RND set.
Just as we use [d] for [d], analogously we use [t]
for [0]. We interpret double consonants are gemi-
nates, and transcribe them as single long conso-
nants. For example nn becomes [n�].
Several words end in a ‘-’ in Köbler’s diction-
ary, meaning that the final sounds are unknown or
irrelevant to root and stem reconstructions. In our
transcriptions, we simply note nothing.
4 Measuring divergence of Dutch dialect
pronunciations with respect to their
proto-language
Once a protolanguage is reconstructed, we are able
to measure the divergence of the pronunciations of
descendant varieties with respect to that protolan-
guage. For this purpose we use Levenshtein dis-
tance, which is explained in Section 4.1. In Sec-
tions 4.2 the Dutch dialects are compared to PLR
and PGD respectively. In Section 4.3 we compare
PLR with PGD.

4.1 Levenshtein distance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
In 1995 Kessler introduced the Levenshtein dis-
tance as a tool for measuring linguistic distances
between language varieties. The Levenshtein dis-
tance is a string edit distance measure, and Kessler
applied this algorithm to the comparison of Irish
dialects. Later the same technique was successfully
applied to Dutch (Nerbonne et al. 1996; Heeringa
2004: 213–278). Below, we give a brief explana-
tion of the methodology. For a more extensive ex-
planation see Heeringa (2004: 121–135).

4.1.1 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968057611111111">
Using the Levenshtein distance, two varieties are
compared by measuring the pronunciation of
words in the first variety against the pronunciation
of the same words in the second. We determine
how one pronunciation might be transformed into
the other by inserting, deleting or substituting
sounds. Weights are assigned to these three opera-
tions. In the simplest form of the algorithm, all op-
erations have the same cost, e.g., 1.
Assume the Dutch word hart ‘heart’ is pro-
nounced as [hart] in the dialect of Vianen (The
Netherlands) and as [,Trta] in the dialect of Naz-
areth (Belgium). Changing one pronunciation into
the other can be done as follows:
hart delete h 1
art subst. a/,T 1
,Trt insert a 1
,Trta

<bodyText confidence="0.998819642857143">
In fact many string operations map [$art] to
[+ito]. The power of the Levenshtein algorithm is
that it always finds the least costly mapping.
To deal with syllabification in words, the
Levenshtein algorithm is adapted so that only a
vowel may match with a vowel, a consonant with a
consonant, the [j] or [w] with a vowel (or oppo-
site), the [i] or [u] with a consonant (or opposite),
and a central vowel (in our research only the
schwa) with a sonorant (or opposite). In this way
unlikely matches (e.g. a [p] with an [a]) are pre-
vented.4 The longest alignment has the greatest
number of matches. In our example we thus have
the following alignment:

The simplest versions of this method are based on
a notion of phonetic distance in which phonetic
overlap is binary: non-identical phones contribute
to phonetic distance, identical ones do not. Thus
the pair [i,1] counts as different to the same degree
as [i,~]. The version of the Levenshtein algorithm
which we use in this paper is based on the com-
parison of spectrograms of the sounds. Since a
spectrogram is the visual representation of the
acoustical signal, the visual differences between
the spectrograms are reflections of the acoustical
differences. The spectrograms were made on the
basis of recordings of the sounds of the Interna-
tional Phonetic Alphabet as pronounced by John
Wells and Jill House on the cassette The Sounds of
the International Phonetic Alphabet from 1995.5
The different sounds were isolated from the re-
cordings and monotonized at the mean pitch of
each of the two speakers with the program
PRAAT6 (Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2005). Next, for

algorithm will consider one of them as an insertion

each sound a spectrogram was made with PRAAT
using the so-called Barkfilter, a perceptually ori-
ented model. On the basis of the Barkfilter repre-
sentation, segment distances were calculated. In-
serted or deleted segments are compared to silence,
and silence is represented as a spectrogram in
which all intensities of all frequencies are equal to
0. We found that the [2] is closest to silence and
the [a] is most distant. This approach is described
extensively in Heeringa (2004, pp. 79-119).
In perception, small differences in pronunciation
may play a relatively strong role in comparison to
larger differences. Therefore we used logarithmic
segment distances. The effect of using logarithmic
distances is that small distances are weighted rela-
tively more heavily than large distances.

4.1.3 Processing RND data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840230769231">
The RND transcribers use slightly different nota-
tions. In order to minimize the effect of these dif-
ferences, we normalized the data for them. The
consistency problems and the way we solved them
are extensively discussed in Heeringa (2001) and
Heeringa (2004). Here we mention one problem
which is highly relevant in the context of this pa-
per. In the RND the ee before r is transcribed as
[e:] by some transcribers and as [r] by other tran-
scribers, although they mean the same pronuncia-
tion as appears from the introductions of the differ-
ent atlas volumes. A similar problem is found for
oo before r which is transcribed either as [o:] or
[u-], and the eu before r which is transcribed as [D:]
or [Y-]. Since similar problems may occur in other
contexts as well, the best solution to overcome all
of these problems appeared to replace all [i]’s by
[e]’s, all [u]’s by [o]’s, and all [Y]’s by [D]’s, even
though meaningful distinctions get lost.
Especially suprasegmentals and diacritics might
be used diffferently by the transcribers. We process
the diacritics voiceless, voiced and nasal only. For
details see Heeringa (2004, p. 110-111).

4.2 Measuring divergence from the proto-

The Levenshtein distance enables us to compare
each of the 360 Dutch dialects to PLR and PGD.
Since we reconstructed 85 words, the distance be-
tween a dialect and a proto-language is equal to the
average of the distances of 85 word pairs.
Figures 1 and 2 show the distances to PLR and
PGD respectively. Dialects with a small distance
are represented by a lighter color and those with a
large distance by a darker color. In the map, dia-
lects are represented by polygons, geographic dia-
lect islands are represented by colored dots, and
linguistic dialect islands are represented by dia-
monds. The darker a polygon, dot or diamond, the
greater the distance to the proto-language.
The two maps show similar patterns. The dia-
lects in the Northwest (Friesland), the West
(Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht) and in the
middle (Noord-Brabant) are relatively close to the
proto-languages. More distant are dialects in the
Northeast (Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel), in the
Southeast (Limburg), close to the middle part of
the Flemish/Walloon border (Brabant) and in the
southwest close to the Belgian/French state border
(West-Vlaanderen).
According to Weijnen (1966), the Frisian, Lim-
burg and West-Flemish dialects are conservative.
Our maps shows that Frisian is relatively close to
proto-Germanic, but Limburg and West-Flemish
are relatively distant. We therefore created two
maps, one which shows distances to PGD based on
vowel substitutions in stressed syllables only, and
another showing distances to PGD on the basis of
consonant substitutions only.7
Looking at the map based on vowel substitutions
we find the vowels of the Dutch province of Lim-
burg and the eastern part of the province Noord-
Brabant relatively close to PGD. Looking at the
map based on consonant substitutions we find the
consonants of the Limburg varieties distant to

PGD. The Limburg dialects have shared in the
High German Consonant Shift. Both the Belgium
and Dutch Limburg dialects are found east of the
Uerdinger Line between Dutch ik/ook/-lijk and
High German ich/auch/-lich. The Dutch Limburg
dialects are found east of the Panninger Line be-
tween Dutch sl/sm/sn/sp/st/zw and High German
schl/schm/schn/schp/scht/schw (Weijnen 1966).
The Limburg dialects are also characterized by the
uvular [R] while most Dutch dialects have the al-
veolar [r]. All of this shows that Limburg conso-
nants are innovative.
The map based on vowel substitutions shows
that Frisian vowels are not particularly close to
PGD. Frisian is influenced by the Ingvaeonic
sound shift. Among other changes, the [Y] changed
into [i], which in turn changed into [e] in some
cases (Dutch dun ‘thin’ is Frisian tin) (Van Bree
1987, p. 69).8 Besides, Frisian is characterized by
its falling diphthongs, which are an innovation as
well. When we consulted the map based on conso-
nant substitutions, we found the Frisian consonants
close to PGD. For example the initial /g/ is still
pronounced as a plosive as in most other Germanic
varieties, but in Dutch dialects – and in standard
Dutch – as a fricative.
When we consider West-Flemish, we find the
vowels closer to PGD than the consonants, but
they are still relatively distant to PGD.

When correlating the 360 dialect distances to PLR
with the 360 dialect distances to PGD, we obtained
a correlation of r=0.87 (p&lt;0.0001)9. This is a sig-
nificant, but not perfect correlation. Therefore we
compared the word transcriptions of PLR with
those of PGD.

gons, geographic dialect islands are represented by
colored dots, and linguistic dialect islands are rep-
resented by diamonds. Lighter polygons, dots or
diamonds represent more conservative dialects and
darker ones more innovative dialects.
First we focus on the reconstruction of vowels.
We find 28 words for which the reconstructed
vowel of the stressed syllable was the same as in
PGD10. In 15 cases, this was the result of applying
the tendencies discussed in Section 2.1. In 13 cases
this was the result of simply choosing the vowel
found most frequently among the 360 word pro-
nunciations. When we do not use tendencies, but
simply always choose the most frequent vowel, we
obtain a correlation which is significantly lower
(x=0.74, p=0).
We found 29 words for which vowel was recon-
structed different from the one in PGD, although
the PGD vowel was found among at least two dia-
lects. For 28 words the vowel in the PGD form was
not found among the 360 dialects, or only one
time. For 11 of these words, the closest vowel
found in the inventory of that word, was recon-
structed. For example the vowel in ook ‘too’ is
[au] in PGD, while we reconstructed [ou].
10 For some words PGD gives multiple pronunciations.
We count the number of words which has the same
vowel in at least one of the PGD pronunciations.

diamonds represent more conservative dialects and
darker ones more innovative dialects.
Looking at the consonants, we found 44 words
which have the same consonants as in PGD.11 For
36 words only one consonant was different, where
most words have at least two consonants. This
shows that the reconstruction of consonants works
much better than the reconstruction of vowels.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998609941176471">
In this paper we tried to reconstruct a ‘proto-
language’ on the basis of the RND dialect material
and see how close we come to the protoforms
found in Köbler’s proto-Germanic dictionary. We
reconstructed the same vowel as in PGD or the
closest possible vowel for 46% of the words.
Therefore, the reconstruction of vowels still needs
to be improved further.
The reconstructions of consonants worked well.
For 52% of the words all consonants reconstructed
are the same as in PGD. For 42% of the words,
only one consonant was differently reconstructed.
And, as a second goal, we measured the diver-
gence of Dutch dialects compared to their proto-
11 When PGD has multiple pronunciations, we count the
number of words for which the consonants are the
same as in at least one of the PGD pronunciations.

language. We calculated dialect distances to PLR
and PGD, and found a correlation of r=0.87 be-
tween the PLR distances and PGD distances. The
high correlation shows the relative influence of
wrongly reconstructed sounds.
When we compared dialects to PLR and PGD,
we found especially Frisian close to proto-
Germanic. When we distinguished between vowels
and consonants, it appeared that southeastern dia-
lects (Dutch Limburg and the eastern part of
Noord-Brabant) have vowels close to proto-
Germanic. Frisian is relatively close to proto-
Germanic because of its consonants.

For this purpose we use Levenshtein distance, which is explained in Section 4.1. In Sections 4.2 the Dutch dialects are compared to PLR and PGD respectively. In Section 4.3 we compare PLR with PGD. 4.1 Levenshtein distance In 1995 Kessler introduced the Levenshtein distance as a tool for measuring linguistic distances between language varieties. The Levenshtein distance is a string edit distance measure, and Kessler applied this algorithm to the comparison of Irish dialects. Later the same technique was successfully applied to Dutch (Nerbonne et al. 1996; Heeringa 2004: 213–278). Below, we give a brief explanation of the methodology. For a more extensive explanation see Heeringa (2004: 121–135). 4.1.1 Algorithm Using the Levenshtein distance, two varieties are compared by measuring the pronunciation of words in the first variety against the pronunciation of the same words in the second. We determine how one pronunciation might be transformed into the other by inserting, deleting or substituting sounds. Weights are assigned to these three operations. In the simplest form of the algorithm, all operations have the same cost, e.g., 1. Assume the Dutch word hart</context>

On the basis of the Barkfilter representation, segment distances were calculated.

We found that the [2] is closest to silence and the [a] is most distant. This approach is described extensively in Heeringa (2004, pp. 79-119).

Sweet (1888) introduced this principle as one of the principles of economy (p. 49). He especially mentioned that in [%] the superfluous [g] is often dropped (p. 42). In our data we found that krom ‘curved’ is pronounced [kru-rn] in most cases, but as [kru-rnp] in the dialect of Houthalen. In the reconstructed form we posit the final [p]. Medial [h] deletes between vowels, and initial [h] before vowels. The word hart ‘heart’ is sometimes pronounced with and sometimes without initial [h]. According to this principle we reconstruct the [h]. [r] changes to [x]. According to Hock and Joseph (1996) the substitution of uvular [R] for trilled (post-)dental [r] is an example of an occasional change apparently resulting from misperception. In the word rijp ‘ripe’ we find initial [r] in most cases and [R] in the dialects of Echt and Baelen. We reconstructed [r]. Syllable initial [w] changes in [v]. Under ‘Lip to Lip-teeth’ Sweet (1888) writes that in “the change of p into f, w into v, we may always assume an intermediate [�], [P], the latter being the Middle German w“ (p. 26), and that the “loss of back modification is shown in the frequent change of (w) into (v) through [P], as in Gm.” Sinc</context>

When both monophthongs and diphthongs are found among the data, we choose the most frequent monophthong. Sweet (1888, p. 21) writes that isolative diphthongizaton “mainly affects long vowels, evidently because of the difficulty of prolonging the same position without change.” 2.2 Consonants For the reconstruction of consonants we used ten tendencies which we discuss one by one below. Initial and medial voiceless obstruents become voiced when (preceded and) followed by a voiced sound. Hock &amp; Joseph (1996) write that weakening (or lenition) “occurs most commonly in a medial voiced environment (just like Verner’s law), but may be found in other contexts as well.” In our data set zes ‘six’ is pronounced with a initial [z] in most cases and with an initial [s] in the dialects of Stiens and Dokkum. We reconstructed [s].2 Final voiced obstruents of an utterance become voiceless. Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natural isolative tendency is to change voice into unvoiced. He also writes that the “tendency to unvoicing is shown most strongly in the stops.” Hock &amp; Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that fi</context>

We exploit here the historical information in this atlas. The goals of this paper are twofold. First we aim to reconstruct a ‘proto-language’ on the basis of the RND dialect material and see how close we come to the protoforms found in Gerhard Köbler’s neuhochdeutsch-germanisches Wörterbuch (Köbler, 2003). We recognize that we actually reconstruct a stage that would never have existed in prehistory. In practice, however, we are usually forced to use incomplete data, since data collections -- such as the RND – are restricted by political boundaries, and often some varieties are lost. In this paper we show the usefulness of a data source like the RND. Second we want to measure the divergence of Dutch dialects compared to their proto-language. We measure the divergence of the dialect pronunciations. We do not measure the number of changes that happened in the course of time. For Abstract In this </context>

We used 360 dialects from locations in the Netherlands, the northern part of Belgium and French-Flanders. The density of dialect locations is about the same everywhere. For each dialect we reconstructed 85 words. For the reconstruction of vowels we used knowledge of Dutch history, and for the reconstruction of consonants we used well-known tendencies found in most textbooks about historical linguistics. We validated results by comparing the reconstructed forms with pronunciations according to a proto-Germanic dictionary (Köbler, 2003). For 46% of the words we reconstructed the same vowel or the closest possible vowel when the vowel to be reconstructed was not found in the dialect material. For 52% of the words all consonants we reconstructed were the same. For 42% of the words, only one consonant was differently reconstructed. We measured the divergence of Dutch dialects from their ‘proto-language’. We measured pronunciation distances to the protolanguage we reconstructed ourselves and correlated them with pronunciation distances we measured to proto-Germanic based on the dictionary. Pronunciation distances were measured u</context>

This happens for example in the word wijn ‘wine’. The cluster ol+d/t diphthongizes to ou + d/t. For example English old and German alt have a /l/ before the /d/ and /t/ respectively. In Old Dutch ol changed into ou (Van Loey 1967, p. 43, Van Bree 1987, p. 135/136). Therefore we reconstruct the /l/ with preceding /o/ or /a/. 3 The proto-language according to the dictionary The dictionary of Köbler (2003) provides Germanic proto-forms. In our Dutch dialect data set we have transcriptions of 125 words per dialect. We found 85 words in the dictionary. Other words were missing, especially plural nouns, and verb forms other than infinitives are not included in this dictionary. For most words, many proto-Germanic forms are given. We used the forms in italics only since these are the main forms according to the author. If different lexical forms are given for the same word, we selected only variants of those lexical forms which appear in standard Dutch or in one of the Dutch dialects. The proto-form</context>

In Köbler’s dictionary we found translations of 85 words only; therefore our analyses are based on those 85 words. We use the comparative method (CM) as the main tool for reconstructing a proto-form on the basis of the RND material. In the following subsections we discuss the reconstruction of vowels and consonants respectively. 2.1 Vowels For the reconstruction of vowels we used knowledge about sound developments in the history of Dutch. In Old Dutch the diphthongs /~Y and /au/ turned into monophthongs /e:/ and /o:/ respectively (Quak &amp; van der Horst 2002, p. 32). Van Bree (1996) mentions the tendencies that lead /e:/ and /o:/ to change into /i:/ and /u:/ respectively. From these data we find the following chains: ai  ei  e  i au  ou  o  u An example is twee ‘two’ which has the vowel [a] in 11% of the dialects, the [e] in 14% of the dialects, the [e] in 43% of the dialects and the [i] in 20% of the dialects. 1 According to the neuhochdeutsch-germanisches Wörterbuch the [a] or [ai] is the original sound. Our data show that simply reconstructing the most frequent sound, which is the [e], would not give the original sound, but using the chain the original sound is </context>
<context position="9235" citStr="(1996)" startWordPosition="1568" endWordPosition="1568">ound most frequently among the 360 varieties, working with Occam’s Razor as a guiding principle. When both monophthongs and diphthongs are found among the data, we choose the most frequent monophthong. Sweet (1888, p. 21) writes that isolative diphthongizaton “mainly affects long vowels, evidently because of the difficulty of prolonging the same position without change.” 2.2 Consonants For the reconstruction of consonants we used ten tendencies which we discuss one by one below. Initial and medial voiceless obstruents become voiced when (preceded and) followed by a voiced sound. Hock &amp; Joseph (1996) write that weakening (or lenition) “occurs most commonly in a medial voiced environment (just like Verner’s law), but may be found in other contexts as well.” In our data set zes ‘six’ is pronounced with a initial [z] in most cases and with an initial [s] in the dialects of Stiens and Dokkum. We reconstructed [s].2 Final voiced obstruents of an utterance become voiceless. Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natural isolative tendency is to change voice into unvoiced. He also writes that the “tendency to unvoicing is shown most strongly in the stops.” Hock &amp; Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that fi</context>
<context position="12988" citStr="(1996)" startWordPosition="2196" endWordPosition="2196">opped. Sweet (1888) introduced this principle as one of the principles of economy (p. 49). He especially mentioned that in [%] the superfluous [g] is often dropped (p. 42). In our data we found that krom ‘curved’ is pronounced [kru-rn] in most cases, but as [kru-rnp] in the dialect of Houthalen. In the reconstructed form we posit the final [p]. Medial [h] deletes between vowels, and initial [h] before vowels. The word hart ‘heart’ is sometimes pronounced with and sometimes without initial [h]. According to this principle we reconstruct the [h]. [r] changes to [x]. According to Hock and Joseph (1996) the substitution of uvular [R] for trilled (post-)dental [r] is an example of an occasional change apparently resulting from misperception. In the word rijp ‘ripe’ we find initial [r] in most cases and [R] in the dialects of Echt and Baelen. We reconstructed [r]. Syllable initial [w] changes in [v]. Under ‘Lip to Lip-teeth’ Sweet (1888) writes that in “the change of p into f, w into v, we may always assume an intermediate [�], [P], the latter being the Middle German w“ (p. 26), and that the “loss of back modification is shown in the frequent change of (w) into (v) through [P], as in Gm.” Sinc</context>

Similarly for the change from /au/ to /o/ we consider the frequency of /o/. Another development mentioned by Van Bree is that high monophthongs diphthongize. In the transition from middle Dutch to modern Dutch, the monophthong /i:/ changed into /ei/, and the monophthong /y:/ changed into either /ary/ or /oi/ (Van der Wal, 1994). According to Van Bree (1996, p. 99), diphthongs have the tendency to lower. This can be observed in Polder Dutch where /ei/ and /cry/ are lowered to /~Y and /au/ (Stroop 1998). We recognize the following chains: i  ei  ai y  wy/oi  au u  ou  au Different from the chains mentioned above, we do not find the /e/ and /o/ respectively in these chains. To get evidence for these chains, the frequency of /e/ should be lower than both the frequency of /e/ and /i/, and the frequency of /o/ should be lower than both /o/ and /u/. Sweet (1888, p. 20) observes that vowels have the tendency to move from back to front.

The darker a polygon, dot or diamond, the greater the distance to the proto-language. The two maps show similar patterns. The dialects in the Northwest (Friesland), the West (Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht) and in the middle (Noord-Brabant) are relatively close to the proto-languages. More distant are dialects in the Northeast (Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel), in the Southeast (Limburg), close to the middle part of the Flemish/Walloon border (Brabant) and in the southwest close to the Belgian/French state border (West-Vlaanderen). According to Weijnen (1966), the Frisian, Limburg and West-Flemish dialects are conservative. Our maps shows that Frisian is relatively close to proto-Germanic, but Limburg and West-Flemish are relatively distant. We therefore created two maps, one which shows distances to PGD based on vowel substitutions in stressed syllables only, and another showing distances to PGD on the basis of consonant substitutions only.7 Looking at the map based on vowel substitutions we find the vowels of the Dutch province of Limburg and the eastern part of the province NoordBrabant relatively close to PGD.
