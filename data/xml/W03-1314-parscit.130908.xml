1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999967416666667">
In previous studies, we demonstrated the feasi-
bility of using NLP techniques such as shallow
parsing of adjectival modification for identifying
hierarchical relations among biomedical terms
(Bodenreider et al., 2001) and for extending an
existing biomedical terminology (Bodenreider et
al., 2002). In these studies, the corpus was bio-
medical terminology or phrases extracted from the
biomedical literature.
Other authors have explored adjectival modifi-
cation in a clinical corpus. Chute and Elkin (1997)
note, based on empirical observation of clinical
data, that many clinical terms are accompanied by
modifiers, including adjectives. The authors make
a distinction between clinical modifiers (such as
chronic, severe, and acute) and operational or ad-
ministrative qualifiers (such as no evidence of, his-
tory of, and status post). It appears that the class of
clinical modifiers consists primarily of adjectives
that provide specific information regarding condi-
tion and are distributed on a scale. They suggest
that operational modifiers be kept separate from
the terms themselves in order to avoid combinato-
rial explosion.
Taking this idea one step further, we believe
that, besides operational modifiers, other adjectives
encountered in clinical phrases could receive a
special treatment in applications such as informa-
tion retrieval. For example, adjectives expressing
nuances useful only in the context of clinical care
could be removed from the phrase when searching
the biomedical literature. This is the case of adjec-
tives expressing degree of certainty (e.g., prob-
able). In other cases, adjectives specific to clinical
phrases can be mapped to synonyms or closely
related modifiers (e.g., greenish sputum, green

Objectives: To explore the phenomenon
of adjectival modification in biomedical
discourse across two genres: the biomedi-
cal literature and patient records. Meth-
ods: Adjectival modifiers are removed
from phrases extracted from two corpora
(three million noun phrases extracted
from MEDLINE, on the one hand, and
clinical notes from the Mayo Clinic, on
the other). The original phrases, the adjec-
tives extracted, and the resulting demodi-
fied phrases are compared across the two
corpora after normalization. Quantitative
comparisons (frequency of occurrence)
are performed on the whole domain.
Qualitative comparisons are performed on
the two subdomains (disorders and proce-
dures). Results: Although the average
number of adjectives per phrase is equiva-
lent in the two corpora (1.4), there are
more adjective types in MAYO than in
MEDLINE for disorders and procedures.
For disorder phrases, the 38% of adjective
types common to the two corpora account
for 85% of the occurrences. The predomi-
nance of adjectives in one corpus is ana-
lyzed. Discussion: Potential applications
of this approach are discussed, namely
terminology acquisition, information re-
trieval, and genre characterization.
sputum). The ability to map stylistic variations of
the same adjective becomes especially important to
establishing links between clinical records and sci-
entific literature, which actually has significant
implications for improving patient care in clinical
practice as well as health science research. Finally,
adjectives absent from the biomedical literature or
terminologies may denote recent phenomena, not
yet integrated in terminologies.
Knowledge about these classes of adjectives
may help map across genres. Conversely, studying
adjectival modification across genres may help
identify adjectives whose representation varies
across genres, possibly denoting one of these phe-
nomena.
In the present paper, we explore the phenome-
non of adjectival modification across two genres:
the biomedical literature and patient records. The
expected outcome of this study is to obtain a better
characterization of adjectival modification in bio-
medical phrases of various origins, in order to fully
take advantage of this phenomenon in applications
such as the automatic construction of terminology
and ontology resources and the retrieval of clinical
documents.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996570470588235">
Adjectival modification as well as lexical seman-
tics of adjectives has been studied extensively in
the linguistic and NLP literature. Most approaches
have been directed at creating adjective taxono-
mies and other ways of classifying and represent-
ing adjectives according to their properties and
function. Raskin and Niernburg (1995) provide a
comprehensive overview of the various approaches
that have been taken to description, classification
and representation of adjectives.
From the NLP standpoint, Fellbaum (1993) par-
titions adjectives in WordNet® 1 into two large
classes: descriptive and relational. Descriptive ad-
jectives “ascribe a value of an attribute to a noun”
(p.27) (i.e., big child) while relational adjectives
are usually derived from and are somehow associ-
ated with a noun (i.e., musical child). Another
prominent distinction has to do with whether an
adjective can express continuous (scalar) or dis-
crete (non-scalar) values. Raskin and Niernburg
(1996) point out that for text meaning representa-
tion for computational semantics, the most impor-
tant distinction to make is between scalar and non-
scalar. They also present a method for incorporat-
ing the semantics of the modifier adjective into the
semantics of the modified noun by representing
nouns as frames with elements such as
ATTRIBUTE_SIZE than can be filled in by the
semantic content of the modifying adjectives.
The major contribution of this study is to ex-
plore adjectival modification across two genres in
the biomedical domain. Our approach is essentially
practical and oriented towards applied perspec-
tives.

3 Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889636363636">
The two genres compared in this study are the
biomedical literature and patient records. More
precisely, we use MEDLINE as our bibliographic
corpus and clinical notes recorded at the Mayo
Clinic as our clinical corpus.
MEDLINE® 2, the U.S. National Library of
Medicine’s (NLM) premier bibliographic database,
contains over twelve million references to articles
from more than 4,600 worldwide journals in life
sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.
Srinivasan et al. (2002) performed a shallow syn-
tactic analysis on the entire MEDLINE collection,
using only titles and abstracts in English. From the
175 million noun phrase types identified in their
study, we selected the subset of “simple” phrases,
i.e., noun phrases excluding prepositional modifi-
cation or any other complex feature. In this study,
a randomly selected subset of three million of these
simple noun phrases constitutes our bibliographic
corpus.
The Mayo Clinic is a group medical practice in
the United States and spans all recognized medical
care settings and specialties. Currently over 50,000
patient visits occur each week that generate 40,000
medical documentation entries in Mayo electronic
record that principally consists of text narratives.
The current size of the collection is approaching
fifteen million notes and each note has on average
200 to 250 words of text. For this study we consid-
ered only the most current sample of the clinical
notes collection – 1,783,377 documents recorded
in 2002. Only simple noun phrases of the same
type extracted from MEDLINE were extracted

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998552">
from this corpus, resulting in a set of 9,665,942
phrases. A randomly selected subset of three mil-
lion of these simple noun phrases constitutes our
clinical corpus.
In both cases, the noun phrases were first nor-
malized for case, so that the two subsets studied
represent three million noun phrase types each.
Another resource used in this study is the Uni-
fied Medical Language System® 3 (UMLS®)
Metathesaurus®. The Metathesaurus, also devel-
oped by NLM, is organized by concept or mean-
ing. A concept is defined as a cluster of terms
representing the same meaning (synonyms, lexical
variants, acronyms, translations). The 14th edition
(2003AA) of the UMLS Metathesaurus contains
over 1.75 million unique English terms drawn from
more than sixty families of medical vocabularies,
and organized in some 875,000 concepts.
In the UMLS, each concept is categorized by
semantic types from the Semantic Network.
McCray et al. (2001) designed groupings of se-
mantic types that provide a partition the Metathe-
saurus and, therefore, can be used to extract
consistent sets of concepts corresponding to a sub-
domain, such as disorders or procedures.

4 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999457923076923">
In order to compare the linguistic phenomenon of
adjectival modification across two corpora of noun
phrases, we first extracted the adjectives after
submitting the phrases to a shallow syntactic
analysis and normalizing the head noun of the
phrase for inflectional variation. Then, we com-
pared across corpora the adjectives on the one hand
and the “demodified” noun phrases4 (i.e., noun
phrases from which the adjectives have been re-
moved) on the other. In order to address the size of
these corpora, we limited the focus of our study to
a significant subdomain of clinical medicine: dis-
orders and procedures.

Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of methods
used for extracting adjectives from the original
noun phrases. It also presents the number of
phrases present before and after each of the four
steps detailed below.

4 also referred to as “nested terms” in the literature
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.952365063829787">
Step 1. Syntactic analysis
The phrases in our bibliographic and clinical
samples were then submitted to an underspecified
syntactic analysis described by Rindflesch et al.
(2000) that draws on a stochastic tagger (see
(Cutting et al., 1992) for details) as well as the
SPECIALIST Lexicon5, a large syntactic lexicon
of both general and medical English that is distrib-
uted with the UMLS. Although not perfect, this
combination of resources effectively addresses the
phenomenon of part-of-speech ambiguity in Eng-
lish.
The resulting syntactic structure identifies the
head and modifiers for the noun phrase analyzed.
Each modifier is also labeled as being adjectival,
adverbial, or nominal. Although all types of modi-
fication in the simple English noun phrase were
labeled, only adjectives and nouns were selected
for further analysis in this study. For example, the
phrase abnormal esophageal motility study was
analyzed as:
[[mod([abnormal,adj]),
mod([esophageal,adj]),
mod([motility,noun]),
head([study,noun])]]
The result of the syntactic analysis was used to
select the noun phrases suitable for studying the
adjectival modification phenomenon, i.e., phrases
having the following structure: (adj+, noun*,
head). The phrase is required to start with an ad-
jectival modifier, possibly followed by other adjec-
tives and end with a head noun, possibly preceded
by other nouns. This specification excludes both
simple phrases (e.g., one isolated noun) and com-
plex phrases, not suitable for our analysis.
Step 2. Normalizing the head noun
In order to compare phrases across corpora, we
normalized the head noun for inflectional variation
in each noun phrase. As a result, the two noun
phrases cerebrovascular accident (in MAYO) and
cerebrovascular accidents (in MEDLINE) are con-
sidered equivalent. When both the singular and the
plural form of a phrase appear in the same corpus,
only the singular form is considered for further
processing. In practice, to normalize head nouns,
we used the program lvg6, developed at NLM and
distributed with the UMLS.

Figure 1. Summary of the methods.
Step 3. Creating demodified phrases
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999585122807018">
When adjectives are identified in a phrase O, a set
of demodified phrases {T1, T2,...,Tn} is created by
removing from phrase O any combinations of ad-
jectival modifiers found in it. While the structure
of the demodified phrases remains syntactically
correct, the semantics of some phrases may be
anomalous, especially when adjectives other than
the leftmost are removed. Since most of them are
semantically valid, we found it convenient to keep
all demodified phrases for further analysis. De-
modified phrases with incorrect semantics will be
filtered out later in the experiment, since they will
appear with a lower frequency.
The number of demodified phrases derived
from a given phrase is 2m – 1, m being the number
of adjectives in the phrase. For example, the phrase
acute respiratory infection syndrome starts with
the two adjectival modifiers acute and respiratory,
so that the following three demodified phrases are
generated respiratory infection syndrome, acute
infection syndrome, and infection syndrome.
Step 4. Restricting to disorders and procedures
Because of the large size of the two corpora, we
only performed a quantitative analysis of adjectival
modification for the whole biomedical domain. We
restricted the qualitative study to disorders and
procedures. These represent a significant subdo-
main of clinical medicine, yet are small enough to
be able to perform at least a somewhat detailed
analysis.
All phrases, original and demodified, were
mapped to the UMLS Metathesaurus by first at-
tempting an exact match between phrases and
Metathesaurus concepts. If an exact match failed,
normalization was then attempted. This process
makes the input and target terms potentially com-
patible by eliminating such inessential differences
as inflection, case and hyphen variation, as well as
word order variation. From the phrases mapping to
some concept in the UMLS, we selected those for
which the semantic category of the concept
mapped to corresponded to the subdomains of in-
terest. In practice, for a phrase to be considered a
procedure, it had to map to a UMLS concept and
the semantic type of this concept had to belong to
the semantic group Procedures. The same principle
was used for selecting disorders, using the seman-
tic group Disorders. For example, the demodified
phrase arthroscopic surgery (derived from decom-
pressive arthroscopic surgery) is considered a pro-
cedure because it maps, as a synonym, to the
concept Surgical Procedures, Arthroscopic, whose
semantic group is Procedures. Exceptionally (32
UMLS concepts), a term may name both a disorder
and a procedure. These terms are simply counted
twice, once with Disorders and once with Proce-
dures.

4.2 Comparing corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999735">
In order to investigate the characteristics of each
corpus (noun phrases extracted from the biomedi-
cal literature and from patient records), we used
two kinds of comparisons: quantitative and qualita-
tive. The quantitative part consists of comparing
frequencies of adjectives and demodified phrases
across corpora, for the whole corpus as well as on
specific subsets (Disorders and Procedures). In the
qualitative part, we examined only phrases form
the subdomains of Disorders and Procedures.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.867849">
Quantitative comparisons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994476190476">
As mentioned earlier, the head noun of each phrase
was normalized for inflectional variation (see Step
2 above). The purpose of normalizing the head
noun is two-fold. First, it contributes to identifying
phrase variants within each corpus, resulting in
accurate counts of phrase types after duplicates had
been removed. Second, it provides a simple means
(string match) for identifying equivalent phrases
across corpora.
We computed the number of original phrases,
adjectives, and demodified phrases in each corpus,
counting tokens and types in each category. Addi-
tionally, we explored similarities between the two
genres by computing the number of phrases and
adjectives common to the two corpora (intersec-
tion). Finally, we computed the number of phrase
and adjective types for the two corpora taken to-
gether (union) in order to better characterize the
whole domain. From these frequencies, we derived
additional parameters such as the ratio of the num-
ber of adjectives to the number of original phrases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.86535">
Qualitative comparisons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901">
We first extracted adjectives from the original
phrases corresponding to Disorders and Procedures
and computed their frequency of occurrence. Be-
cause phrases must map to a UMLS term in order
to be identified as members of a subdomain, only
the adjectives present in biomedical terms can be
analyzed. For this reason, their rank will be studied
rather than their frequency7.
In order to better represent the whole spectrum
of adjectives present in the two corpora, we then
turned to the demodified phrases instead of the
original phrases. In this second part, the condition
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.49558">
7 rank n simply corresponds to the nth highest frequency
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981631578947">
for a phrase to be considered a member of a sub-
domain was that the demodified phrase (not the
entire phrase) map to a UMLS term. However,
some adjectives may be overrepresented when sev-
eral demodified phrases map to a UMLS term in
the subdomains considered. For example, the
phrase abdominal vascular reconstructive surgery,
once demodified, maps to both vascular surgery
(with modifiers abdominal and reconstructive) and
reconstructive surgery (with modifiers abdominal
and vascular). In this case, the adjective abdominal
was counted twice.
For each adjective, we determined the corpus in
which it was predominantly used. If more than half
of the occurrences appear in one corpus, the adjec-
tive is considered predominant in this corpus.
When more than half of the occurrences appear in
both corpora, the adjective is considered common
to the two corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999748786885246">
The number of original phrases (Table 1), adjec-
tives (Table 2), and demodified phrases (Table 3)
are presented below in tabular format. Counts are
broken down by corpus (MEDLINE and MAYO), on
the one hand, and by subdomain (Disorders and
Prodedures), on the other. Tables also include re-
sults obtained on the whole corpus (All), i.e., with-
out subsetting, and on the union of the two corpora
(Together). Except for original phrases (Table 1),
which, by design, are phrase types, Table 2 and
Table 3 contain the numbers of types (upper left)
and tokens (lower right).
The number of adjectives per phrase ranges
from 1 to 16 in MEDLINE and from 1 to 7 for
MAYO when the whole corpus is considered. The
maximum number of adjectives per phrase is 6 or 7
for the various subsets. Phrases containing so many
adjectives may look syntactically and semantically
suspicious. While some of them denote extraction
errors (often due to inappropriate part-of-speech
tagging), most correspond to valid phrases and re-
flect the complexity of the biomedical domain
(e.g., diastolic systolic mean middle cerebral ar-
tery blood flow velocity and combined enteral par-
enteral synthetic hypercaloric nutrition). The
distribution of the number of adjectives per phrase
is plotted in Figure 2.
Although the number of phrases processed is
slightly more important for MAYO (1,575,476)
than for MEDLINE (1,322,403), and although the
ratio of the number of adjective tokens extracted to
the number of original phrases is roughly similar in
the two corpora (1.45 for MEDLINE and 1.40 for
MAYO), there are significantly more adjective
types in MEDLINE (72,324) than in MAYO
(44,268). A difference in the opposite direction is
observed in the Disorders and Procedures subsets,
where the number of adjective types is higher in
MAYO than in MEDLINE, while the average number
of adjectives per phrase is still slightly higher in
MEDLINE (1.27 vs. 1.21 for Disorders and 1.21 vs.
1.14 for Procedures). This finding requires further
investigation.
Despite reducing the variation by normalizing
head nouns for inflection, less than 3% of the
original phrases are common to the two corpora.
This proportion is significantly higher for the sub-
set of disorder and procedure phrases where up to
one third of MEDLINE phrases can be found in the
MAYO corpus. Not surprisingly, the proportion of
adjectives in common is higher. Overall, 44% of
the adjectives in MAYO are also found in MEDLINE
and up to 75% of the adjectives in MEDLINE are
also found in MAYO (for disorders). Interestingly,
the adjectives common to both corpora are also the
most frequent. For example, as shown in Table 2,
the 1,584 adjective types in common in the subset
Disorders account for 38% of all adjectives for
Disorders (4,148), but the corresponding 25,557
adjective tokens account for 85% of all tokens
(30,046).

Considering not the original phrases, but de-
modified phrases corresponding to disorders and
procedures, most adjectives with a frequency
greater than 10 are found in the two corpora (86%
for disorder and 80% for procedures). However,
their representation may differ largely across cor-
pora. Examining the contexts of adjectives for Dis-
orders (4978 adjectives with a frequency greater
than 10), we found that 40% of the adjectives ap-
pear predominantly in MAYO (e.g., mild, possible,
recent, probable, questionable, greenish), 20%
predominantly in MEDLINE (e.g., experimental,
human, neonatal, canine, intracellular), while 40%
share most of their contexts across the two corpora
(e.g., acute, chronic, recurrent). The repartition of
the demodified phrases for Disorders (8263
phrases with a frequency greater than 10) is some-
what different. 65% of the demodified phrases ap-
pear predominantly in MAYO (e.g., discomfort,
tenderness, low back pain, chest pain, diarrhea),
15% predominantly in MEDLINE (e.g., resistance,
strain, vesicle, hyperthermia), while 20% share
most of their contexts across the two corpora (e.g.,
disease, lesion, pain, symptom, abnormality).

6 Applications

In this section, we briefly examine some of the
applications that may benefit from a better knowl-
edge of adjectival modification in biomedical dis-
course: genre characterization, terminology and
ontology acquisition, and information retrieval.

Genre characterization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952315789474">
Knowledge about adjectives and demodified
phrases predominantly associated with one corpus
may be useful to characterize corpora, and in this
experiment, genres. Although limited, this study
suggests, for example, that a clinical corpus con-
tains markers for uncertainty (e.g., possible, prob-
able, questionable) and non-specific symptoms
(e.g., discomfort, low back pain). On the other
hand, in a broad bibliographic corpus, precisions
about organism or age groups must be given (e.g.,
human, canine, neonatal). Interestingly, while the
term fever is found with no predominance in either
corpus, its more scientific synonyms hyperthermia
and pyrexia are used predominantly in MEDLINE. If
corroborated, this finding may suggest that, al-
though both scientific publications and medical
records are geared toward peers, the language used
in scientific publications tends to be more special-
ized.

Terminology and ontology acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966875">
The method described in this paper constitutes a
useful technique for adapting existing terminol-
ogies and ontologies with empirically derived
terms from a new subdomain. First, demodified
phrases are more likely to be mapped to another
corpus. And second, because adjectival modifica-
tion often denotes a hyponymic relation between a
phrase without modifier and a modified phrase, the
modified phrase can be linked as a candidate hy-
ponym to the phrase without modifier
(Bodenreider et al., 2002).
This approach could be used, for example, for
adapting biomedical terminologies to subtle clini-
cal nuances. When used with exactly the same
subdomain the existing terminology comes from,
this technique could enable regular updates of the
terminology provided that current textual data is
used for phrase extraction.
The approach is currently limited to simple ad-
jectival modification; however, this is a self-
imposed limitation. Theoretically, the same meth-
odology can be adapted to work on nominal,
prepositional phrase and other types of modifica-
tion.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.484532" genericHeader="method">
Information retrieval
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979066666666">
Terminologies as well as ontologies are frequently
used for information or document retrieval in the
domains for which such terminologies or ontolo-
gies are available. Medicine is one such domain
where there are numerous terminological re-
sources. Integrated in a system such as the UMLS,
these resources provide, for example, many syno-
nyms for each concept, increasing the chances of
retrieving documents from a given term. However,
most terms in these resources are pre-coordinated
and may not include all the variants needed in
various contexts. Moreover, most terms are noun
phrases and, while synonyms are often given for
nouns, it may not be the case for their modifiers.
For example, while the various synonyms for fever
(e.g., hyperthermia and pyrexia) are present in the
UMLS, there is no greenish variant for green spu-
tum. Nor can there systematically be a variant de-
noting uncertainty. Therefore, identifying classes
of adjectives that can be either ignored (e.g., uncer-
tainty markers) or mapped to other adjectives (e.g.,
greenish to green) would increase the performance
of information retrieval systems operating on clini-
cal corpora. In light of these findings, existing ter-
minologies and ontologies can provide a core of
medical concepts common to most subdomains;
whereas the methodology described here can be
used to tailor the general-purpose terminological
resources to accommodate subdomain-specific
terminology services.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976153846154">
In conclusion, adjectival modification plays an im-
portant role in biomedical texts, and knowledge
about this phenomenon can be exploited in appli-
cations such as the retrieval of biomedical docu-
ments and for developing terminology services in
the biomedical domain.
In the future, we would like to identify patterns
in biomedical terms and phrases based, in part, on
classes of adjectival modifiers. Creating such a
model for terms would constitute a generative ap-
proach to biomedical terminology, contrasting with
the lists of precoordinated terms populating most
terminology systems in the biomedical domain.

A concept is defined as a cluster of terms representing the same meaning (synonyms, lexical variants, acronyms, translations). The 14th edition (2003AA) of the UMLS Metathesaurus contains over 1.75 million unique English terms drawn from more than sixty families of medical vocabularies, and organized in some 875,000 concepts. In the UMLS, each concept is categorized by semantic types from the Semantic Network. McCray et al.

Our approach is essentially practical and oriented towards applied perspectives. 3 Resources The two genres compared in this study are the biomedical literature and patient records. More precisely, we use MEDLINE as our bibliographic corpus and clinical notes recorded at the Mayo Clinic as our clinical corpus. MEDLINE® 2, the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) premier bibliographic database, contains over twelve million references to articles from more than 4,600 worldwide journals in life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine. Srinivasan et al. (2002) performed a shallow syntactic analysis on the entire MEDLINE collection, using only titles and abstracts in English. From the 175 million noun phrase types identified in their study, we selected the subset of “simple” phrases, i.e., noun phrases excluding prepositional modification or any other complex feature. In this study, a randomly selected subset of three million of these simple noun phrases constitutes our bibliographic corpus.
