This paper proposes a new indicator of text struc-
ture, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP),
which locates segment boundaries in a text. A
text segment is a coherent scene; the words in
a segment are linked together via lexical cohesion
relations. LCP records mutual similarity of words
in a sequence of text. The similarity of words,
which represents their cohesiveness, is computed
using a semantic network. Comparison with the
text segments marked by a number of subjects
shows that LCP closely correlates with the hu-
man judgments. LCP may provide valuable in-
formation for resolving anaphora and ellipsis.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999487909090909">
A text is not just a sequence of words, but it has
coherent structure. The meaning of each word
can not be determined until it is placed in the
structure of the text. Recognizing the structure
of text is an essential task in text understanding,
especially in resolving anaphora and ellipsis.
One of the constituents of the text struc-
ture is a text segment. A text segment, whether
or not it is explicitly marked, as are sentences and
paragraphs, is defined as a sequence of clauses or
sentences that display local coherence. It resem-
bles a scene in a movie, which describes the same
objects in the same situation.
This paper proposes an indicator, called the
lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates seg-
ment boundaries in a narrative text. LCP is a
record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a se-
quence of text. Lexical cohesiveness is defined
as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993)
computed by spreading activation on a semantic
network. Hills and valleys of LCP closely corre-
late with changing of segments.

SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99948447826087">
Several methods to capture segment boundaries
have been proposed in the studies of text struc-
ture. For example, cue phrases play an impor-
tant role in signaling segment changes. (Grosz
and Sidner, 1986) However, such clues are not di-
rectly based on coherence which forms the clauses
or sentences into a segment.
Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabu-
lary management profile) as an indicator of seg-
ment boundaries. VMP is a record of the number
of new vocabulary terms introduced in an inter-
val of text. However, VMP does not work well on
a high-density text. The reason is that coherence
of a segment should be determined not only by
reiteration of words but also by lexical cohesion.
Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget&apos;s the-
saurus to determine whether or not two words
have lexical cohesion. Their method can cap-
ture almost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g.
systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.
However it does not deal with strength of cohe-
siveness which suggests the degree of contribution
to coherence of the segment.

<bodyText confidence="0.97102955">
Kozima and Furugori (1993) defined lexical co-
hesiveness as semantic similarity between words,
and proposed a method for measuring it. Sim-
ilarity between words is computed by spreading
activation on a semantic network which is system-
atically constructed from an English dictionary
(LDOCE).
The similarity (TOD, w&apos;) E [0,1] between
words to, w&apos; is computed in the following way:
(1) produce an activated pattern by activating
the node w; (2) observe activity of the node w1
in the activated pattern. The following examples
suggest the feature of the similarity cr:
pet) = 0.133722 ,
hat) = 0.001784 ,
restaurant) = 0.175699 ,
restaurant) = 0.006260 .
The similarity a- depends on the significance
s(w) E [0, 1], i.e. normalized information of the
word w in West&apos;s corpus (1953). For example:

LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE

<bodyText confidence="0.9821905">
LCP of the text T = {w1,• • •, wN} is a sequence
{c(Si),• • •, c(SN)} of lexical cohesiveness c(Si). Si
is the word list which can be seen through a fixed-

Lexical cohesiveness c(Si) of the word list Si is
defined as follows:

<equation confidence="0.994501">
c(Si) = Ewes, s(w)-a.(P(Si),w) ,

where a(P(Si), tv) is the activity value of the
node w in the activated pattern P(S). P(Si)
is produced by activating each node w E Si with
strength s(w)2/ s(w). Figure 1 shows a sam-
ple pattern of {red, alcoholic, drink). (Note
that it has highly activated nodes like bottle and
wine.)
The definition of c(Si) above expresses that
c(Si) represents semantic homogeneity of Si,
since P(Si) represents the average meaning of
w E Si. For example:
c(&amp;quot;Molly saw a cat. It was her family
pet. She wished to keep a lion.&amp;quot;

c(&amp;quot;There is no one but me. Put on
your clothes. I can not walk more.&amp;quot;

LCP and Its Feature
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988013">
A graph of LCP, which plots c(Si) at the text
position i, indicates changing of segments:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97519875">
• If Si is inside a segment, it tends to be co-
hesive and makes c(Si) high.
• If Si is crossing a segment boundary, it tends
to semantically vary and makes c(Si) low.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985493">
As shown in Figure 2, the segment boundaries
can be detected by the valleys (minimum points)
of LCP.
The LCP, shown in Figure 3, has large hills
and valleys, and also meaningless noise. The
graph is so complicated that one can not easily
determine which valley should be considered as a
segment boundary.
The shape of the window, which defines
weight of words in it for pattern production,
makes LCP smooth. Experiments on several win-
dow shapes (e.g. triangle window, etc.) shows
that Harming window is best for clarifying the
macroscopic features of LCP.
The width of the window also has effect on
the macroscopic features of LCP, especially on
separability of segments. Experiments on several
window widths (A =5 — 60) reveals that the Han-
ning window of A =25 gives the best correlation
between LCP and segments.

VERIFICATION OF LCP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952714285714">
This section inspects the correlation between
LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the
human judgments. The curve of Figure 4 shows
the LCP of the simplified version of 0.Henry&apos;s
&amp;quot;Springtime a la Carte&amp;quot; (Thornley, 1960). The
solid bars represent the histogram of segment
boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the
text without paragraph structure.
It is clear that the valleys of the LCP cor-
respond mostly to the dominant segment bound-
aries. For example, the clear valley at i = 110
exactly corresponds to the dominant segment
boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary
shown as a dotted line).
Note that LCP can detect segment changing
of a text regardless of its paragraph structure.
For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary,
but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment
boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary
and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not
a paragraph boundary.
However, some valleys of the LCP do not
exactly correspond to segment boundaries. For
example, the valley near i = 450 disagree with
the segment boundary at i = 465. The reason is
that lexical cohesion can not cover all aspect of
coherence of a segment; all incoherent piece of
text can be lexically cohesive.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906111111111">
This paper proposed LCP, all indicator of seg-
ment changing, which concentrates on lexical
cohesion of a text. segment. The experiment
proved that LCP closely correlate with the seg-
ment boundaries captured by the human judg-
ments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role
in forming a sequence of words into segments.
Text segmentation described here provides
basic information for text understanding:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998807333333333">
Segment boundaries can be considered as
segment switching (push and pop) in hier-
archical structure of text.
The segmentation can be applied also to text
summarizing. (Consider a list of average meaning
of segments.)
In future research, the author needs to ex-
amine validity of LCP for other genres — Hearst
(1993) segments expository texts. Incorporating
other clues (e.g. cue phrases, tense and aspect,
etc.) is also needed to make this segmentation
method more robust.
