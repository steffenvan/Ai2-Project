In the past decade, statistical machine translation
(SMT) has been advanced from word-based SMT
to phrase- and syntax-based SMT. Although this
advancement produces significant improvements
in BLEU scores, crucial meaning errors and lack
of cross-sentence connections at discourse level
still hurt the quality of SMT-generated transla-
tions. More recently, we have witnessed two ac-
tive movements in SMT research: one towards
combining semantics and SMT in attempt to gen-
erate not only grammatical but also meaning-
preserved translations, and the other towards ex-
ploring discourse knowledge for document-level
machine translation in order to capture inter-
sentence dependencies.
The emergence of semantic SMT are due to the
combination of two factors: the necessity of se-
mantic modeling in SMT and the renewed interest
of designing models tailored to relevant NLP/SMT
applications in the semantics community. The
former is represented by recent numerous studies
on exploring word sense disambiguation, semantic
role labeling, bilingual semantic representations as
well as semantic evaluation for SMT. The latter
is reflected in CoNLL shared tasks, SemEval and
SenEval exercises in recent years.
The need of capturing cross-sentence dependen-
cies for document-level SMT triggers the resur-
gent interest of modeling translation from the per-
spective of discourse. Discourse phenomena, such
as coherent relations, discourse topics, lexical co-
hesion that are beyond the scope of conventional
sentence-level n-grams, have been recently con-
sidered and explored in the context of SMT.
This tutorial aims at providing a timely and
combined introduction of such recent work along
these two trends as discourse is inherently con-
nected with semantics. The tutorial has three parts.
The first part critically reviews the phrase- and11
syntax-based SMT. The second part is devoted to
the lines of research oriented to semantic SMT,
including a brief introduction of semantics, lex-
ical and shallow semantics tailored to SMT, se-
mantic representations in SMT, semantically mo-
tivated evaluation as well as advanced topics on
deep semantic learning for SMT. The third part
is dedicated to recent work on SMT with dis-
course, including a brief review on discourse stud-
ies from linguistics and computational viewpoints,
discourse research from monolingual to multilin-
gual, discourse-based SMT and a few advanced
topics.
The tutorial is targeted for researchers in the
SMT, semantics and discourse communities. In
particular, the expected audience comes from two
groups: 1) Researchers and students in the SMT
community who want to design cutting-edge mod-
els and algorithms for semantic SMT with various
semantic knowledge and representations, and who
would like to advance SMT from sentence-by-
sentence translation to document-level translation
with discourse information; 2) Researchers and
students from the semantics and discourse com-
munity who are interested in developing models
and methods and adapting them to SMT.

Dr. Deyi Xiong is a professor at Sochoow Uni-
versity. His research interests are in the area of
natural language processing, particularly statisti-
cal machine translation and parsing. Previously
he was a research scientist at the Institute for
Infocomm Research of Singapore. He received
the B.Sc degree from China University of Geo-
sciences (Wuhan, China) in 2002, the Ph.D.degree
from the Institute of Computing Technology (Bei-
jing, China) in 2007, both in computer science. He
has published papers in prestigious journals and
conferences on statistical machine translation, in-
cluding Computational Linguistics, IEEE TASLP,
JAIR, NLE, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI and IJCAI. He
was the program co-chair of IALP 2012 and CLIA
workshop 2011.
Dr. Min Zhang, a distinguished professor and
Director of the Research Center of Human Lan-
guage Technology at Soochow University (China),
received his Bachelor degree and Ph.D. degree in
computer science from Harbin Institute of Tech-
nology in 1991 and 1997, respectively. From
1997 to 1999, he worked as a postdoctoral re-
search fellow in Korean Advanced Institute of Sci-
ence and Technology in South Korea. He began
his academic and industrial career as a researcher
at Lernout &amp; Hauspie Asia Pacific (Singapore) in
Sep. 1999. He joined Infotalk Technology (Singa-
pore) as a researcher in 2001 and became a senior
research manager in 2002. He joined the Institute
for Infocomm Research (Singapore) as a research
scientist in Dec. 2003. He joined the Soochow
University as a distinguished professor in 2012.
His current research interests include machine
translation, natural language processing, informa-
tion extraction, social network computing and In-
ternet intelligence. He has co-authored more than
150 papers in leading journals and conferences,
and co-edited 10 books/proceedings published by
Springer and IEEE. He was the recipient of several
awards in China and oversea. He is the vice pres-
ident of COLIPS (2011-2013), the elected vice
chair of SIGHAN/ACL (2014-2015), a steering12
committee member of PACLIC (2011-now), an
executive member of AFNLP (2013-2014) and
a member of ACL (since 2006). He supervises
Ph.D students at National University of Singapore,
