Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999813541666667">
Through the application of Chinese WordNet,
the current study used the manipulation of
visual field and the number of senses of the
first character in Chinese disyllabic com-
pounds to investigate the representation and
the hemispheric processing of related senses
in nouns and verbs. In the previous study,
Huang et al. (2009) have found the ERP evi-
dence to indicate single entry representation
for Chinese polysemy in the left hemisphere;
however, in the right hemisphere, they found
sense inhibition which may be due to (1) the
nature of hemispheric processing in dealing
with semantic ambiguity or (2) the semantic
activation from the separate-entry representa-
tion for senses. To clarify these possibilities,
the study used the word class judgment task
with the attempt to push subjects in a deeper
level of lexical processing. The results re-
vealed sense facilitation effect in the RH and
suggested that in a deeper level, the RH had
more possibility to observe the sense facilita-
tion due to different efficiency of cerebral
hemispheres.

1.1 Homonymy vs. polysemy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999696">
Lexical ambiguity is very common in language.
Linguistically, homonymy and polysemy are tradi-
tionally distinguished as two types of ambiguity.
Early behavioral studies on semantic ambiguity
obtained ambiguity advantage effects (e.g., Ru-
benstein et al., 1970; Jastrzembski, 1981, Millis &amp;
Button, 1989) in lexical decisions in which ambi-
guous words yielded faster reaction time than un-
ambiguous words. However, the same results were
not replicated in some other studies (e.g., Bo-
rowsky &amp; Masson, 1996; Azuma &amp; Van Orden,
1997). More recent psycholinguistic studies found
that the so-called ambiguity advantage effects were
in fact resulted from the activation of words having
related senses rather than that of words having un-
related meanings (e.g., Rodd et al., 2002; Beretta et
al., 2005; Pylkkänen et al., 2006). These studies
were generally in agreement with the linguistic
assumption in that homonymy and polysemy might
be represented differently in the mental lexicon.

<bodyText confidence="0.999960411764706">
The issue of hemispheric processing in combina-
tion with lexical ambiguity have been widely stu-
died (e.g., Burgess &amp; Simpson, 1988; Beeman &amp;
Chiarello, 1998; Faust &amp; Lavidor, 2003) and sug-
gested that both cerebral hemispheres process word
meanings in complementary ways. For example,
Faust and Lavidor (2003) demonstrated that the
LH benefited most from semantically congruent
primes related to dominant meaning of ambiguous
targets while the RH benefited most from semanti-
cally mixed primes. The overall pattern of priming
was also suggestive of dissociation in the hemis-
pheric meaning retrieval, with the LH engaging in
fine semantic coding that focused on a single
meaning interpretation, and the RH engaging in
coarser semantic coding where multiple alternate
meanings were activated. Alternatively, Federmei-

er and Kutas (1999) offered electrophysiological
data in a sentence comprehension task to present
another explanation in hemispheric language
processing. They suggested that while both hemis-
pheres involved in lexical resolution, they played
different roles with the LH being ‘predictive’, the
RH being ‘integrative’, to complement each other.
Pylkkänen et al., (2006) were the first to focus
on the investigation of how different but related
senses were psychologically represented in the
mental lexicon. Their MEG data suggested the sin-
gle-entry representation for related senses in the
LH whereas they showed the sense inhibition in
the RH and interpreted it as a potential sense com-
petition effect. In Chinese, Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated similar patterns in their ERP data in
which there was sense facilitation in the LH and
sense inhibition in the RH. Nevertheless, the ques-
tion concerning the representation of related senses
in the RH still left unresolved. Early studies on
Chinese ambiguity such as Lin (1999) obtained
ambiguity advantage but the calculation of ‘senses’
&apos;included related and unrelated meanings and the
effect was not reliable enough.

1.3 Ambiguity in Chinese disyllabic com-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988928571429">
In Chinese words recognition process, the issue of
lexical ambiguity involves the composition of con-
stituent characters and how they contribute to the
whole word reading. Chinese words differ from
English in at least two aspects. First, about 80% of
Chinese words are composed of two characters
(Huang et al., 2006). Second, unlike the words in
English, which every word is composed of letters
corresponding to phonemes, Chinese words consist
of characters corresponding to morphemes. In oth-
er words, each character in Chinese has its mor-
pheme(s) when they are embedded in two-
character compounds. Therefore, before we look
into the lexical ambiguity of two-character words

1 The definition of “sense” in Lin (1999) is different from the
“sense advantage effect” demonstrated by Rodd et al. (2002).
Lin argued that “meaning” in past research is used as a general
term to refer to any kind of linguistic meaning. He claimed
that, based upon Ahrens (1999) and Ahrens et al. (1998), it is
better to use “sense” and “facets” as a measure index. Though
the “number of senses” Lin used is a little different from the
“number of meanings” used by Azuma and Van Orden (1997),
it is regarded that Lin still did not solve the unreliable findings
of ambiguity advantage effect.

<bodyText confidence="0.999947803921569">
as lexical items, we should investigate the sense
representation of its subcomponent, the representa-
tion of its single character within two-character
compounds.
In the circumstance which every character in
the disyllabic compounds may contribute to word
recognition, there still exists disparity between the
roles of the first and second character. In light of
the studies on the neighborhood size effect, word
recognition process will be influenced by the com-
position of letters or characters. In English, faci-
litative neighborhood size effects and inhibitory
neighborhood size effects were robust findings in
low frequency words (e.g. Andrews, 1989, 1992;
Grainger and Jacobs, 1996). In the Chinese neigh-
borhood size study (Huang et al., 2006) and eye
movement study (Tsai et al., 2006), it was sug-
gested that the neighborhood size of the first cha-
racter constituent played a more important role in
lexical processing than did neighborhood size of
the second character constituent. Based on the as-
sumption that the first character will play a key
role in whole word reading, the study primarily
manipulated the number of senses of the first cha-
racter and attempted to reveal the hypotheses of
sense representation in the context provided by the
second character.
The question left in Huang et al. (2009) was
that whether the sense inhibition in the RH was
due to the nature of hemispheric processing in
dealing with semantic ambiguity or the semantic
activation from the separate-entry representation
for senses. Considering the sense inhibition in the
N400 of the ERP component, the pattern in their
data was that words having many senses were
more negative than those having few senses. That
is, there existed competition when the first charac-
ters of the targets had many related senses. Never-
theless, based on the single entry assumption for
related senses, we assumed sense facilitation for
the representation of senses.
In Huang et al. (2009), they required subjects
to make word/ non-word lexical decision, but sub-
jects might make their judgments based on percep-
tual familiarity rather than the involvement of
lexical access. Previous studies on probabilistic
phonotactics (Vitevitch and Luce, 1998) or on
Chinese semantic combinability (Cheng, 2006)
have demonstrated opposing effects in early and
late levels of word processing. In order to clarify
the results in Huang et al. (2009), we designed the

By changing the depth of the task, the goal of the
experiment was to find out if, under the assump-
tion of single entry representation for senses, there
was a chance to discover the sense facilitation in
the RH. Suppose the representation of Chinese
senses had single entry, words having more senses
should be less negative than few senses in the
N400 because of the benefits of semantic activa-
tion. On the contrary, if there were multiple entries
for senses in the RH, words of more senses should
be more negative than few senses and displayed
semantic competition and inhibition.

120 Chinese disyllabic compounds, counterba-
lanced with word class (noun/ verb), were divided
into four subsets according to visual field (LVF/
RVF) and NOS of the first character (few/ many
senses). Few-sense words were those whose first
character senses were from 1 to 3 (mean 1.97)
whereas many-sense words were those whose first
character senses were over 6 (mean 11.38). Possi-
ble confounding factors such as word frequency,
NS1, NS2 were controlled.
The number of senses in the current study was
collected from the Chinese WordNet, a lexical cor-
pus of Mandarin Chinese and established by Aca-
demia Sinica in Taiwan. The corpus attempts to
build an up-to-date Chinese lexical network and
provides complete information of Chinese word
senses.
In Chinese, there exists controversy over the
distinction of verbs and nouns. To avoid this prob-
lem, the resolutions included: (1) to label the word
class according to the system established in Aca-
demia Sinica balanced corpus of modern Chinese
and (2) to give pilot pretests to another group of
people to exclude these possibly confused choices.

<bodyText confidence="0.999965774193548">
Each trial began with a white cross presented cen-
trally for 500 ms. Presentation of the target words
appeared on the screen for 150 ms. The disyllabic
compound targets were vertically arranged in the
left or right visual hemifield with inner edge two
degrees of visual angle from fixation. Presentation
of numbers from 1 to 9 appeared pseudorandomly
in the center of the screen in order to control par-
ticipants’ eyesight. At the end of each trial, a capi-
tal B was presented in the center to allow eye
blinking for 1500 ms. Participants were asked not
to blink their eyes until the appearance to the capi-
tal B to minimize the interference of eye move-
ment.
Participants were instructed to judge whether
the compound presented was a noun or a verb. For
odd-number subjects, they were asked to press the
response box with both of their index fingers when
the targets were verbs and with both of their mid-
dle fingers when the targets were nouns. For even-
number subjects, the instruction was the opposite.
To control the central fixation of eyes, numbers
from 1 to 9 also appeared pseudorandomly. Odd-
number subjects should press the response box
with both of their index fingers when number 6 to
9 was presented centrally on the screen and with
both of their middle fingers when number 1 to 4
was on the screen. For even-number subjects, in-
struction reversed. Response time and event-
related potentials data were both collected during
the process.

Behavioral accuracy below 70 percent and ERPs

analyses.
The electroencephalogram was recorded from 64
electrodes embedded in an electro-cap(QuickCap,
Neuromedical Supplies, Sterling, Texas, USA),
referenced to the left and right mastoid, M1, M2
respectively. Positions of all the electrodes were
arranged according to the international ten-twenty

nuously recorded and digitized at a rate of 500 Hz.
The signal was amplified by SYNAMPS2 (Neu-
roscan Inc., El Paso, Texas, USA) with the band-
pass set at 0.5–100 Hz. Blinks and eye movements
were monitored via electrodes placed on the infra-
orbital ridges of the left eye (VEOG) and the outer
canthus left and right electrode (HEOG). A ground
electrode was placed on the forehead anterior to
the FZ electrode. Electrode impedance was kept

In the analyses of the ERP waveforms elicited by
every stimulus in each condition, there were typi-
cally composed of a negative-going peak at around
100ms (N1), a positive-going peak at around
200ms (P200), a negative-going peak maximizing
at around 400 ms (N400) over central and parietal
electrode sites. Among these, N 170 was regarded
as the early index for visual detection in word
processing. In the current study, N170 was used to
examine the manipulation of visual field. N400
was characterized as an index sensitive to lan-
guage-related processing and was generally consi-
dered in response to violations of semantic
expectations (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980). With the
presentation of a semantically inappropriate or in-
congruent word, a large N400 activity would be
elicited. In Huang et al. (2009), the 400 in the RH
was regarded as sense competition because words
with many senses elicit more negativity at around

<bodyText confidence="0.999989086206897">
In the behavioral data, no significant main effect of
the number of senses and interaction was observed.
Nevertheless, the ERP data demonstrated that there
was marginal significance of two-way interaction
(visual field ͪ number of senses) and a marginally
significant 4-way interaction. Post-hoc comparison
showed that there were significant sense facilita-
tion effects in the RH and no effect in the LH. ERP
waveforms showed that words of few senses eli-
cited more negativity than words of many senses
around 400 ms in the RH, but the two conditions
did not differ from each other in the LH.
The marginality of statistical significance led
to the speculation in that the word category effect
might dilute the sense effect in the experiment.
Many studies, in general, suggested that the neural
systems for lexical processing of nouns and verbs
were anatomically distinct. For example, in child-
ren’s lexical development, the acquisition of nouns
seems to be earlier and easier than that of verbs
(Gentner, 1982). In aphasic findings, case studies
indicated that patients with lesions located in left
anterior and middle temporal lobe, outside so
called language areas, had difficulty in the produc-
tion of nouns whereas patients with lesions areas in
left frontal premotor cortex had difficulty in the
production of verbs (Damasio &amp; Damasio, 1992;
Damasio et al., 1993). Evidence from event-related
potentials also disclosed electrocortical differences
between nouns and verbs over widespread cortical
areas (Pulvermüller et al., 1999). Therefore, verbs
were assumed to elicit stronger electrocortical ac-
tivity around primary frontal, prefrontal areas as-
sociated with motor, premotor functions. Nouns,
associated with concrete and well-imaginable
meanings related to visual modality, were assumed
to elicit larger electrocortical activity around visual
cortices.
There was also evidence indicating that the
conclusions were oversimplified. For example,
Tyler et al. (2001, PET) found no significant action
differences for nouns and verbs in lexical decision
and semantic categorization task. Similarly, in an
fMRI Chinese study, Li et al. (2004) pointed out
that nouns and verbs were found to activate a wide
range of overlapping brain areas and suggested
distributed networks for either word class. One
recent Chinese study on concreteness also showed
similar distribution over the scalp for both nouns
and verbs (Tsai et al., 2008).
The study was not meant to resolve the con-
troversy of neural representations for nous and
verbs. Instead, from the marginal significance of
the data in the experiment, we speculated that the
word class effect may influence the results, which
led to the failure to reach significance in overall
data. Therefore, we reanalyzed the data with the
addition word class as one within-subject factor.

The purpose of additional analyses of sense effects
in nouns and verbs was to examine clearer effects
of senses without the confounding of the word
class factor. The separate analyses for nouns and
verbs both showed significant sense effects in the
lateral sites. Furthermore, planned comparison of
the senses demonstrated disparate distributions for
nouns and verbs respectively. To be more specific,
the sense effects for nouns were located in central-
to-parietal areas of brain, whereas these effects for
verbs primarily showed up in frontal, central, cen-
tral-parietal electrodes on the left. The re-analyses
of ERP data showed that the differences of distri-
bution from either word category diluted the sense
effect observed in the first analysis; therefore, the
data was only marginally significant in the original
analyses. Besides, though the current study was not
meant to resolve the representations for different
word categories, the additional results seemed to
support the distinct neural representations for
nouns and verbs, since each word class had its dis-
tribution for the sense effects. Certainly, further
evidence of Chinese word class was required to
approve the statement since there was also evi-
dence suggesting distributed network for Chinese
lexical processing (e.g. Li et al., 2004).
According to previous studies, different levels
of processing in perception of words would lead to
opposing results (e.g. Vitevitch and Luce, 1998;
Cheng, 2006). Suppose the results were derived
from the single entry representation of senses, the
sense effect should be observed in the RH in the
experiment since the depth of the task was changed.
In other words, when subjects were undergoing a
deeper level of lexical processing, the relatedness
of senses might have been early processed in the

processing; on the other hand, the sense effect
might appear in the RH because its capacity al-
lowed alternate meanings to maintain. Hence, in a
deeper level of task, which slowed down the se-
mantic processing, the facilitative sense effect was
observed in the RH.
Overall, we suggested that the representation
of Chinese senses be single entry and obtained the

The study attempted to find out whether the repre-
sentation of senses in the RH was single-or sepa-
rate-entry. When the depth of task was changed,
the RH advantage for the processing of semantical-
ly related senses was observed. The finding was
consistent with recent studies on the representation
of polysemy (e.g. Beretta et al. 2005; Pylkkänen et
al. 2006, Rodd et al., 2002).

<abstract confidence="0.99747216">Through the application of Chinese WordNet, the current study used the manipulation of visual field and the number of senses of the first character in Chinese disyllabic compounds to investigate the representation and the hemispheric processing of related senses in nouns and verbs. In the previous study, Huang et al. (2009) have found the ERP evidence to indicate single entry representation for Chinese polysemy in the left hemisphere; however, in the right hemisphere, they found sense inhibition which may be due to (1) the nature of hemispheric processing in dealing with semantic ambiguity or (2) the semantic activation from the separate-entry representation for senses. To clarify these possibilities, the study used the word class judgment task with the attempt to push subjects in a deeper level of lexical processing. The results revealed sense facilitation effect in the RH and suggested that in a deeper level, the RH had more possibility to observe the sense facilitation due to different efficiency of cerebral hemispheres.</abstract>

Though the “number of senses” Lin used is a little different from the “number of meanings” used by Azuma and Van Orden (1997), it is regarded that Lin still did not solve the unreliable findings of ambiguity advantage effect. as lexical items, we should investigate the sense representation of its subcomponent, the representation of its single character within two-character compounds.

However, the same results were not replicated in some other studies (e.g., Borowsky &amp; Masson, 1996; Azuma &amp; Van Orden, 1997). More recent psycholinguistic studies found that the so-called ambiguity advantage effects were in fact resulted from the activation of words having related senses rather than that of words having unrelated meanings (e.g., Rodd et al., 2002; Beretta et al., 2005; Pylkkänen et al., 2006).

They suggested that while both hemispheres involved in lexical resolution, they played different roles with the LH being ‘predictive’, the RH being ‘integrative’, to complement each other. Pylkkänen et al., (2006) were the first to focus on the investigation of how different but related senses were psychologically represented in the mental lexicon. Their MEG data suggested the single-entry representation for related senses in the LH whereas they showed the sense inhibition in the RH and interpreted it as a potential sense competition effect. In Chinese, Huang et al. (2009) demonstrated similar patterns in their ERP data in which there was sense facilitation in the LH and sense inhibition in the RH. Nevertheless, the question concerning the representation of related senses in the RH still left unresolved. Early studies on Chinese ambiguity such as Lin (1999) obtained ambiguity advantage but the calculation of ‘senses’ &apos;included related and unrelated meanings and the effect was not reliable enough. 1.3 Ambiguity in Chinese disyllabic compounds In Chinese words recognition process, the issue of lexical ambiguity involves the composition of constituent characters a</context>

Early studies on Chinese ambiguity such as Lin (1999) obtained ambiguity advantage but the calculation of ‘senses’ &apos;included related and unrelated meanings and the effect was not reliable enough. 1.3 Ambiguity in Chinese disyllabic compounds In Chinese words recognition process, the issue of lexical ambiguity involves the composition of constituent characters and how they contribute to the whole word reading. Chinese words differ from English in at least two aspects. First, about 80% of Chinese words are composed of two characters (Huang et al., 2006). Second, unlike the words in English, which every word is composed of letters corresponding to phonemes, Chinese words consist of characters corresponding to morphemes. In other words, each character in Chinese has its morpheme(s) when they are embedded in twocharacter compounds. Therefore, before we look into the lexical ambiguity of two-character words 1 The definition of “sense” in Lin (1999) is different from the “sense advantage effect” demonstrated by Rodd et al. (2002). Lin argued that “meaning” in past research is used as a general term to refer to any kind of linguistic meaning. He c</context>

In the circumstance which every character in the disyllabic compounds may contribute to word recognition, there still exists disparity between the roles of the first and second character. In light of the studies on the neighborhood size effect, word recognition process will be influenced by the composition of letters or characters. In English, facilitative neighborhood size effects and inhibitory neighborhood size effects were robust findings in low frequency words (e.g. Andrews, 1989, 1992; Grainger and Jacobs, 1996). In the Chinese neighborhood size study (Huang et al., 2006) and eye movement study (Tsai et al., 2006), it was suggested that the neighborhood size of the first character constituent played a more important role in lexical processing than did neighborhood size of the second character constituent. Based on the assumption that the first character will play a key role in whole word reading, the study primarily manipulated the number of senses of the first character and attempted to reveal the hypotheses of sense representation in the context provided by the second character.

(2009), the 400 in the RH was regarded as sense competition because words with many senses elicit more negativity at around A 2ͪ2 (number of senses ͪ visual field) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on correct RTs and accuracy.

First, about 80% of Chinese words are composed of two characters (Huang et al., 2006). Second, unlike the words in English, which every word is composed of letters corresponding to phonemes, Chinese words consist of characters corresponding to morphemes. In other words, each character in Chinese has its morpheme(s) when they are embedded in twocharacter compounds. Therefore, before we look into the lexical ambiguity of two-character words 1 The definition of “sense” in Lin (1999) is different from the “sense advantage effect” demonstrated by Rodd et al. (2002). Lin argued that “meaning” in past research is used as a general term to refer to any kind of linguistic meaning. He claimed that, based upon Ahrens (1999) and Ahrens et al. (1998), it is better to use “sense” and “facets” as a measure index. Though the “number of senses” Lin used is a little different from the “number of meanings” used by Azuma and Van Orden (1997), it is regarded that Lin still did not solve the unreliable findings of ambiguity advantage effect. as lexical items, we should investigate the sense representation of its subcomponent, the representation of its single character w</context>

The results revealed sense facilitation effect in the RH and suggested that in a deeper level, the RH had more possibility to observe the sense facilitation due to different efficiency of cerebral hemispheres. 1 Introduction 1.1 Homonymy vs. polysemy Lexical ambiguity is very common in language. Linguistically, homonymy and polysemy are traditionally distinguished as two types of ambiguity. Early behavioral studies on semantic ambiguity obtained ambiguity advantage effects (e.g., Rubenstein et al., 1970; Jastrzembski, 1981, Millis &amp; Button, 1989) in lexical decisions in which ambiguous words yielded faster reaction time than unambiguous words. However, the same results were not replicated in some other studies (e.g., Borowsky &amp; Masson, 1996; Azuma &amp; Van Orden, 1997).

That is, there existed competition when the first characters of the targets had many related senses. Nevertheless, based on the single entry assumption for related senses, we assumed sense facilitation for the representation of senses. In Huang et al. (2009), they required subjects to make word/ non-word lexical decision, but subjects might make their judgments based on perceptual familiarity rather than the involvement of lexical access. Previous studies on probabilistic phonotactics (Vitevitch and Luce, 1998) or on Chinese semantic combinability (Cheng, 2006) have demonstrated opposing effects in early and late levels of word processing. In order to clarify the results in Huang et al. (2009), we designed the 46 These subjects were asked to use their language intuition to write down their word-class judgments in a paper sheet containing 120 targets. word class judgment task to deepen the difficulty of the experimental procedure. 2 The experiment By changing the depth of the task, the goal of the experiment was to find out if, under the assumption of single entry representation for senses, there was</context>

Certainly, further evidence of Chinese word class was required to approve the statement since there was also evidence suggesting distributed network for Chinese lexical processing (e.g. Li et al., 2004). According to previous studies, different levels of processing in perception of words would lead to opposing results (e.g. Vitevitch and Luce, 1998; Cheng, 2006). Suppose the results were derived from the single entry representation of senses, the sense effect should be observed in the RH in the experiment since the depth of the task was changed. In other words, when subjects were undergoing a deeper level of lexical processing, the relatedness of senses might have been early processed in the LH due to the engagement in fine semantic processing; on the other hand, the sense effect might appear in the RH because its capacity allowed alternate meanings to maintain. Hence, in a deeper level of task, which slowed down the semantic processing</context>
