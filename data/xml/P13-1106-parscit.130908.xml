Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999856892857143">
Translated bi-texts contain complemen-
tary language cues, and previous work
on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
has demonstrated improvements in perfor-
mance over monolingual taggers by pro-
moting agreement of tagging decisions be-
tween the two languages. However, most
previous approaches to bilingual tagging
assume word alignments are given as fixed
input, which can cause cascading errors.
We observe that NER label information
can be used to correct alignment mis-
takes, and present a graphical model that
performs bilingual NER tagging jointly
with word alignment, by combining two
monolingual tagging models with two uni-
directional alignment models. We intro-
duce additional cross-lingual edge factors
that encourage agreements between tag-
ging and alignment decisions. We design
a dual decomposition inference algorithm
to perform joint decoding over the com-
bined alignment and NER output space.
Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset
demonstrate that our method yields signif-
icant improvements in both NER and word
alignment over state-of-the-art monolin-
gual baselines.

We study the problem of Named Entity Recogni-
tion (NER) in a bilingual context, where the goal
is to annotate parallel bi-texts with named entity
tags. This is a particularly important problem for
machine translation (MT) since entities such as
person names, locations, organizations, etc. carry
much of the information expressed in the source
sentence. Recognizing them provides useful in-
formation for phrase detection and word sense dis-
ambiguation (e.g., “melody” as in a female name
has a different translation from the word “melody”
in a musical sense), and can be directly leveraged
to improve translation quality (Babych and Hart-
ley, 2003). We can also automatically construct a
named entity translation lexicon by annotating and
extracting entities from bi-texts, and use it to im-
prove MT performance (Huang and Vogel, 2002;
Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). Previous work
such as Burkett et al. (2010b), Li et al. (2012) and
Kim et al. (2012) have also demonstrated that bi-
texts annotated with NER tags can provide useful
additional training sources for improving the per-
formance of standalone monolingual taggers.
Because human translation in general preserves
semantic equivalence, bi-texts represent two per-
spectives on the same semantic content (Burkett et
al., 2010b). As a result, we can find complemen-
tary cues in the two languages that help to dis-
ambiguate named entity mentions (Brown et al.,
1991). For example, the English word “Jordan”
can be either a last name or a country. Without
sufficient context it can be difficult to distinguish
the two; however, in Chinese, these two senses are
disambiguated: “乔丹” as a last name, and “约旦”
as a country name.
In this work, we first develop a bilingual NER
model (denoted as BI-NER) by embedding two
monolingual CRF-based NER models into a larger
undirected graphical model, and introduce addi-
tional edge factors based on word alignment (WA).
Because the new bilingual model contains many
cyclic cliques, exact inference is intractable. We
employ a dual decomposition (DD) inference al-
gorithm (Bertsekas, 1999; Rush et al., 2010) for
performing approximate inference. Unlike most

previous applications of the DD method in NLP,
where the model typically factors over two com-
ponents and agreement is to be sought between the
two (Rush et al., 2010; Koo et al., 2010; DeNero
and Macherey, 2011; Chieu and Teow, 2012), our
method decomposes the larger graphical model
into many overlapping components where each
alignment edge forms a separate factor. We design
clique potentials over the alignment-based edges
to encourage entity tag agreements. Our method
does not require any manual annotation of word
alignments or named entities over the bilingual
training data.
The aforementioned BI-NER model assumes
fixed alignment input given by an underlying word
aligner. But the entity span and type predictions
given by the NER models contain complementary
information for correcting alignment errors. To
capture this source of information, we present a
novel extension that combines the BI-NER model
with two uni-directional HMM-based alignment
models, and perform joint decoding of NER and
word alignments. The new model (denoted as
BI-NER-WA) factors over five components: one
NER model and one word alignment model for
each language, plus a joint NER-alignment model
which not only enforces NER label agreements but
also facilitates message passing among the other
four components. An extended DD decoding algo-
rithm is again employed to perform approximate
inference.
We give a formal definition of the Bi-NER
model in Section 2, and then move to present the
Bi-NER-WA model in Section 3.

The inputs to our models are parallel sentence
pairs (see Figure 1 for an example in English and
Chinese). We denote the sentences as e (for En-
glish) and f (for Chinese). We assume access
to two monolingual linear-chain CRF-based NER
models that are already trained. The English-side
CRF model assigns the following probability for a
tag sequence ye:

<equation confidence="0.997001">
H ψ(vi) H ω(vi, vj)

Ze(e)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999117571428571">
where Ve is the set of vertices in the CRF and
De is the set of edges. ψ(vi) and ω(vi, vj) are
the node and edge clique potentials, and Ze(e)
is the partition function for input sequence e un-
der the English CRF model. We let k(ye) be the
un-normalized log-probability of tag sequence ye,
defined as:

<equation confidence="0.89336">
k(ye) = log rI ψ(vi) rI ω(vi, vj)
(viEVe (vi,vj)EDe
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917">
Similarly, we define model PCRFf and un-
normalized log-probability l(yf) for Chinese.
We also assume that a set of word alignments
(A = {(i, j) : ei ↔ fj}) is given by a word
aligner and remain fixed in our model.
For clarity, we assume ye and yf are binary vari-
ables in the description of our algorithms. The ex-
tension to the multi-class case is straight-forward
and does not affect the core algorithms.

Similar to previous work, we solve this DD
problem by iteratively updating the sub-gradient
as depicted in Algorithm 1. T is the maximum
number of iterations before early stopping, and αt
is the learning rate at time t. We adopt a learning
rate update rule from Koo et al. (2010) where αt is
defined as 1N, where N is the number of times we
observed a consecutive dual value increase from
iteration 1 to t.
A thorough introduction to the theoretical foun-
dations of dual decomposition algorithms is be-
yond the scope of this paper; we encourage un-
familiar readers to read Rush and Collins (2012)

The previously discussed hard agreement model
rests on the core assumption that aligned words
must have identical entity tags. In reality, however,
this assumption does not always hold. Firstly, as-
suming words are correctly aligned, their entity
tags may not agree due to inconsistency in anno-
tation standards. In Figure 1, for example, the

word “Beijing” can be either a Geo-Political En-
tity (GPE) or a location. The Chinese annotation
standard may enforce that “Beijing” should always
be tagged as GPE when it is mentioned in isola-
tion, while the English standard may require the
annotator to judge based on word usage context.
The assumption in the hard agreement model can
also be violated if there are word alignment errors.
In order to model this uncertainty, we extend
the two previously independent CRF models into a
larger undirected graphical model, by introducing
a cross-lingual edge factor φ(i, j) for every pair of
word positions (i, j) E A. We associate a clique
potential function h(i,j)(yei, yfj) for φ(i, j):

where pmi(yei, yfj) is the point-wise mutual in-
formation (PMI) of the tag pair, and we raise it
to the power of a posterior alignment probability
Pˆ(ei, fj). For a pair of NEs that are aligned with
low probability, we cannot be too sure about the
association of the two NEs, therefore the model
should not impose too much influence from the
bilingual agreement model; instead, we will let the
monolingual NE models make their decisions, and
trust that those are the best estimates we can come
up with when we do not have much confidence in
their bilingual association. The use of the poste-
rior alignment probability facilitates this purpose.
Initially, each of the cross-lingual edge factors
will attempt to assign a pair of tags that has the
highest PMI score, but if the monolingual taggers
do not agree, a penalty will start accumulating
over this pair, until some other pair that agrees bet-
ter with the monolingual models takes the top spot.

Simultaneously, the monolingual models will also
be encouraged to agree with the cross-lingual edge
factors. This way, the various components effec-
tively trade penalties indirectly through the cross-
lingual edges, until a tag sequence that maximizes
the joint probability is achieved.
Since we assume no bilingually annotated NER
corpus is available, in order to get an estimate of
the PMI scores, we first tag a collection of unan-
notated bilingual sentence pairs using the mono-
lingual CRF taggers, and collect counts of aligned
entity pairs from this auto-generated tagged data.
Each of the φ(i, j) edge factors (e.g., the edge
between node f3 and e4 in Figure 1) overlaps with
each of the two CRF models over one vertex (e.g.,
f3 on Chinese side and e4 on English side), and
we seek agreement with the Chinese CRF model
over tag assignment of fj, and similarly for ei on
English side. In other words, no direct agreement
between the two CRF models is enforced, but they
both need to agree with the bilingual edge factors.
The updated optimization problem becomes:
where the notation ye(k)
i denotes tag assignment to
word ei by the English CRF and ye(h)
i denotes as-
signment to word ei by the bilingual factor; yf(l)
j
denotes the tag assignment to word fj by the Chi-
nese CRF and yf(h)
j denotes assignment to word
fj by the bilingual factor.
The updated DD algorithm is illustrated in Al-
gorithm 2 (case 2). We introduce two separate
sets of dual constraints we and wf, which range
over the set of vertices on their respective half
of the graph. Decoding the edge factor model
h(i,j)(yei , yfj) simply involves finding the pair of
tag assignments that gives the highest PMI score,
subject to the dual constraints.
The way DD algorithms work in decomposing
undirected graphical models is analogous to other
message passing algorithms such as loopy belief
propagation, but DD gives a stronger optimality
guarantee upon convergence (Rush et al., 2010).

3 Joint Alignment and NER Decoding
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991002">
In this section we develop an extended model in
which NER information can in turn be used to
improve alignment accuracy. Although we have
seen more than a handful of recent papers that ap-
ply the dual decomposition method for joint in-
ference problems, all of the past work deals with
cases where the various model components have
the same inference output space (e.g., dependency
parsing (Koo et al., 2010), POS tagging (Rush et
al., 2012), etc.). In our case the output space is
the much more complex joint alignment and NER
tagging space. We propose a novel dual decom-
position variant for performing inference over this
jointspace.
Most commonly used alignment models, such
as the IBM models and HMM-based aligner are
unsupervised learners, and can only capture sim-
ple distortion features and lexical translational fea-
tures due to the high complexity of the structure
prediction space. On the other hand, the CRF-
based NER models are trained on manually anno-
tated data, and admit richer sequence and lexical
features. The entity label predictions made by the
NER model can potentially be leveraged to correct
alignment mistakes. For example, in Figure 1, if
the tagger knows that the word “Agency” is tagged
I-ORG, and if it also knows that the first comma
in the Chinese sentence is not part of any entity,
then we can infer it is very unlikely that there ex-
ists an alignment link between “Agency” and the
comma.
To capture this intuition, we extend the BI-NER
model to jointly perform word alignment and NER
decoding, and call the resulting model BI-NER-
WA. As a first step, instead of taking the output
from an aligner as fixed input, we incorporate two
uni-directional aligners into our model. We name
the Chinese-to-English aligner model as m(Be)
and the reverse directional model n(Bf). Be is
a matrix that holds the output of the Chinese-to-
English aligner. Each be(i, j) binary variable in
Be indicates whether fj is aligned to ei; similarly
we define output matrix Bf and bf(i, j) for Chi-
nese. In our experiments, we used two HMM-
based alignment models. But in principle we can
adopt any alignment model as long as we can per-
form efficient inference over it.
We introduce a cross-lingual edge factor ζ(i, j)
in the undirected graphical model for every pair of
word indices (i, j), which predicts a binary vari-

We include two dual constraints de(i, j) and
df(i, j) over alignments for every bilingual edge
factor ζ(i, j), which are applied to the English and
Chinese sides of the alignment space, respectively.
The DD algorithm used for this model is given
in Algorithm 2 (case 3). One special note is that
after each iteration when we consider updates to
the dual constraint for entity tags, we only check
tag agreements for cross-lingual edge factors that
have an alignment assignment value of 1. In other
words, cross-lingual edges that are not aligned do
not affect bilingual NER tagging.
Similar to φ(i, j), ζ(i, j) factors do not provide
that much additional information other than some
selectional preferences via PMI score. But the
real power of these cross-language edge cliques
is that they act as a liaison between the NER
and alignment models on each language side, and
encourage these models to indirectly agree with
each other by having them all agree with the edge
cliques.
It is also worth noting that since we decode
the alignment models with Viterbi inference, ad-
ditional constraints such as the neighborhood con-
straint proposed by DeNero and Macherey (2011)
can be easily integrated into our model. The
neighborhood constraint enforces that if fj is
aligned to ei, then fj can only be aligned to ei+1
or ei−1 (with a small penalty), but not any other
word position. We report results of adding neigh-
borhood constraints to our model in Section 6.

ing the Champollion Tool Kit (Ma, 2006). Af-
ter discarding sentences with no aligned counter-
part, a total of 402 documents and 8,249 paral-
lel sentence pairs were used for evaluation. We
will refer to this evaluation set as full-set. We use
odd-numbered documents as the dev set and even-

did not perform parameter tuning on the dev set
to optimize performance, instead we fix the ini-

The Stanford CRF-based NER tagger was used
as the monolingual component in our models
(Finkel et al., 2005). It also serves as a state-
of-the-art monolingual baseline for both English
and Chinese. For English, we use the default tag-
ger setting from Finkel et al. (2005). For Chi-
nese, we use an improved set of features over the
default tagger, which includes distributional sim-
ilarity features trained on large amounts of non-
overlapping data.1
We train the two CRF models on all portions
of the OntoNotes corpus that are annotated with
named entity tags, except the parallel-aligned por-
tion which we reserve for development and test
purposes. In total, there are about 660 train-
ing documents (∼16k sentences) for Chinese and
1,400 documents (∼39k sentences) for English.

notated in OntoNotes, which include person, lo-
cation, date, money, and so on, we select the four
most commonly seen named entity types for evalu-
ation. They are person, location, organization and
GPE. All entities of these four types are converted
to the standard BIO format, and background to-
kens and all other entity types are marked with
tag O. When we consider label agreements over
aligned word pairs in all bilingual agreement mod-
els, we ignore the distinction between B- and z-
tags.
We report standard NER measures (entity pre-
cision (P), recall (R) and F1 score) on the test
set. Statistical significance tests are done using the
paired bootstrap resampling method (Efron and
Tibshirani, 1993).

directional HMM models as our baseline and
monolingual alignment models. The parameters
of the HMM were initialized by IBM Model 1 us-
ing the agreement-based EM training algorithms
from Liang et al. (2006). Each model is trained
for 2 iterations over a parallel corpus of 12 mil-
lion English words and Chinese words, almost
twice as much data as used in previous work that
yields state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment re-
sults (DeNero and Klein, 2008; Haghighi et al.,
2009; DeNero and Macherey, 2011).
Word alignment evaluation is done over the
sections of OntoNotes that have matching gold-
standard word alignment annotations from GALE
Y1Q4 dataset.2 This subset contains 288 docu-
ments and 3,391 sentence pairs. We will refer
to this subset as wa-subset. This evaluation set
is over 20 times larger than the 150 sentences
set used in most past evaluations (DeNero and
Klein, 2008; Haghighi et al., 2009; DeNero and
Macherey, 2011).
Alignments input to the BI-NER model are
produced by thresholding the averaged posterior
probability at 0.5. In joint NER and alignment ex-
periments, instead of posterior thresholding, we
take the direct intersection of the Viterbi-best
alignment of the two directional models. We re-
port the standard P, R, F1 and Alignment Error
Rate (AER) measures for alignment experiments.
An important past work to make comparisons
with is Burkett et al. (2010b). Their method
is similar to ours in that they also model bilin-
gual agreement in conjunction with two CRF-
based monolingual models. But instead of using
just the PMI scores of bilingual NE pairs, as in
our work, they employed a feature-rich log-linear
model to capture bilingual correlations. Parame-
ters in their log-linear model require training with
bilingually annotated data, which is not readily
available. To counter this problem, they proposed
an “up-training” method which simulates a super-
vised learning environment by pairing a weak clas-
sifier with strong classifiers, and train the bilin-
gual model to rank the output of the strong classi-
fier highly among the N-best outputs of the weak
classifier. In order to compare directly with their
method, we obtained the code behind Burkett et
al. (2010b) and reproduced their experimental set-
ting for the OntoNotes data. An extra set of 5,000
unannotated parallel sentence pairs are used for

5 Bilingual NER Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997437037037">
The main results on bilingual NER over the test
portion of full-set are shown in Table 1. We
initially experimented with the hard agreement
model, but it performs quite poorly for reasons we
discussed in Section 2.2. The BI-NER model with
soft agreement constraints, however, significantly
outperforms all baselines. In particular, it achieves
an absolute F1 improvement of 6.7% in Chinese
and 2.1% in English over the CRF monolingual
baselines.
A well-known issue with the DD method is
that when the model does not necessarily con-
verge, then the procedure could be very sensi-
tive to hyper-parameters such as initial step size
and early termination criteria. If a model only
gives good performance with well-tuned hyper-
parameters, then we must have manually anno-
tated data for tuning, which would significantly
reduce the applicability and portability of this
method to other language pairs and tasks. To eval-
uate the parameter sensitivity of our model, we
run the model from 50 to 3000 iterations before
early stopping, and with 6 different initial step
sizes from 0.01 to 1. The results are shown in Fig-
ure 2. The soft agreement model does not seem to
be sensitive to initial step size and almost always
converges to a superior solution than the baseline.

precision goes down significantly. This is be-

We can examine the example in Figure 3 to gain
an understanding of the model’s performance. In
this example, a snippet of a longer sentence pair is
shown with NER and word alignment results. The
monolingual Chinese tagger provides a strong cue
that word f6 is a person name because the unique
4-character word pattern is commonly associated
with foreign names in Chinese, and also the word
is immediately preceded by the word “president”.
The English monolingual tagger, however, con-
fuses the aligned word e0 with a GPE.
Our bilingual NER model is able to correct this
error as expected. Similarly, the bilingual model
corrects the error over e11. However, the model
also propagates labeling errors from the English
side over the entity “Tibet Autonomous Region” to
the Chinese side. Nevertheless, the resulting Chi-
nese tags are arguably more useful than the origi-
nal tags assigned by the baseline model.
In terms of word alignment, the HMM models

The idea of employing bilingual resources to im-
prove over monolingual systems has been ex-
plored by much previous work. For example,
Huang et al. (2009) improved parsing performance
using a bilingual parallel corpus. In the NER
domain, Li et al. (2012) presented a cyclic CRF
model very similar to our BI-NER model, and
performed approximate inference using loopy be-
lief propagation. The feature-rich CRF formula-
tion of bilingual edge potentials in their model is
much more powerful than our simple PMI-based
bilingual edge model. Adding a richer bilingual
edge model might well further improve our results,
and this is a possible direction for further experi-
mentation. However, a big drawback of this ap-
proach is that training such a feature-rich model
requires manually annotated bilingual NER data,
which can be prohibitively expensive to generate.
How and where to obtain training signals with-
out manual supervision is an interesting and open
question. One of the most interesting papers in this
regard is Burkett et al. (2010b), which explored
an “up-training” mechanism by using the outputs
from a strong monolingual model as ground-truth,
and simulated a learning environment where a
bilingual model is trained to help a “weakened”
monolingual model to recover the results of the
strong model. It is worth mentioning that since
our method does not require additional training
and can take pretty much any existing model as
“black-box” during decoding, the richer and more
accurate bilingual model learned from Burkett et
al. (2010b) can be directly plugged into our model.
A similar dual decomposition algorithm to ours
was proposed by Riedel and McCallum (2011)
for biomedical event detection. In their Model
3, the trigger and argument extraction models
are reminiscent of the two monolingual CRFs in
our model; additional binding agreements are en-
forced over every protein pair, similar to how we
enforce agreement between every aligned word

pair. Martins et al. (2011b) presented a new DD
method that combines the power of DD with the
augmented Lagrangian method. They showed
that their method can achieve faster convergence
than traditional sub-gradient methods in models
with many overlapping components (Martins et
al., 2011a). This method is directly applicable to
our work.
Another promising direction for improving
NER performance is in enforcing global label
consistency across documents, which is an idea
that has been greatly explored in the past (Sut-
ton and McCallum, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney,
2004; Finkel et al., 2005). More recently, Rush
et al. (2012) and Chieu and Teow (2012) have
shown that combining local prediction models
with global consistency models, and enforcing
agreement via DD is very effective. It is straight-
forward to incorporate an additional global consis-
tency model into our model for further improve-
ments.
Our joint alignment and NER decoding ap-
proach is inspired by prior work on improving
alignment quality through encouraging agreement
between bi-directional models (Liang et al., 2006;
DeNero and Macherey, 2011). Instead of enforc-
ing agreement in the alignment space based on
best sequences found by Viterbi, we could opt
to encourage agreement between posterior prob-
ability distributions, which is related to the pos-
terior regularization work by Grac¸a et al. (2008).
Cromi`eres and Kurohashi (2009) proposed an ap-
proach that takes phrasal bracketing constraints
from parsing outputs, and uses them to enforce
phrasal alignments. This idea is similar to our joint
alignment and NER approach, but in our case the
phrasal constraints are indirectly imposed by en-
tity spans. We also differ in the implementation
details, where in their case belief propagation is
used in both training and Viterbi inference.
Burkett et al. (2010a) presented a supervised
learning method for performing joint parsing and
word alignment using log-linear models over parse
trees and an ITG model over alignment. The
model demonstrates performance improvements
in both parsing and alignment, but shares the com-
mon limitations of other supervised work in that it
requires manually annotated bilingual joint pars-
ing and word alignment data.
Chen et al. (2010) also tackled the problem of
joint alignment and NER. Their method employs a
set of heuristic rules to expand a candidate named
entity set generated by monolingual taggers, and
then rank those candidates using a bilingual named
entity dictionary. Our approach differs in that we
provide a probabilistic formulation of the problem
and do not require pre-existing NE dictionaries.

We introduced a graphical model that combines
two HMM word aligners and two CRF NER tag-
gers into a joint model, and presented a dual de-
composition inference method for performing ef-
ficient decoding over this model. Results from
NER and word alignment experiments suggest that
our method gives significant improvements in both
NER and word alignment. Our techniques make
minimal assumptions about the underlying mono-
lingual components, and can be adapted for many
other tasks such as parsing.

However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We introduce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</abstract>

Recognizing them provides useful information for phrase detection and word sense disambiguation (e.g., “melody” as in a female name has a different translation from the word “melody” in a musical sense), and can be directly leveraged to improve translation quality (Babych and Hartley, 2003). We can also automatically construct a named entity translation lexicon by annotating and extracting entities from bi-texts, and use it to improve MT performance (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). Previous work such as Burkett et al. (2010b), Li et al. (2012) and Kim et al.

Because human translation in general preserves semantic equivalence, bi-texts represent two perspectives on the same semantic content (Burkett et al., 2010b). As a result, we can find complementary cues in the two languages that help to disambiguate named entity mentions (Brown et al., 1991). For example, the English word “Jordan” can be e</context>

This is a particularly important problem for machine translation (MT) since entities such as person names, locations, organizations, etc. carry much of the information expressed in the source sentence. Recognizing them provides useful information for phrase detection and word sense disambiguation (e.g., “melody” as in a female name has a different translation from the word “melody” in a musical sense), and can be directly leveraged to improve translation quality (Babych and Hartley, 2003). We can also automatically construct a named entity translation lexicon by annotating and extracting entities from bi-texts, and use it to improve MT performance (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).

They showed that their method can achieve faster convergence than traditional sub-gradient methods in models with many overlapping components (Martins et al., 2011a). This method is directly applicable to our work. Another promising direction for improving NER performance is in enforcing global label consistency across documents, which is an idea that has been greatly explored in the past (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004; Finkel et al., 2005). More recently, Rush et al. (2012) and Chieu and Teow (2012) have shown that combining local prediction models with global consistency models, and enforcing agreement via DD is very effective. It is straightforward to incorporate an additional global consistency model into our model for further improvements.

Similar to φ(i, j), ζ(i, j) factors do not provide that much additional information other than some selectional preferences via PMI score. But the real power of these cross-language edge cliques is that they act as a liaison between the NER and alignment models on each language side, and encourage these models to indirectly agree with each other by having them all agree with the edge cliques. It is also worth noting that since we decode the alignment models with Viterbi inference, additional constraints such as the neighborhood constraint proposed by DeNero and Macherey (2011) can be easily integrated into our model. The neighborhood constraint enforces that if fj is aligned to ei, then fj can only be aligned to ei+1 or ei−1 (with a small penalty), but not any other word position.

Although we have seen more than a handful of recent papers that apply the dual decomposition method for joint inference problems, all of the past work deals with cases where the various model components have the same inference output space (e.g., dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2010), POS tagging (Rush et al., 2012), etc.). In our case the output space is the much more complex joint alignment and NER tagging space. We propose a novel dual decomposition variant for performing inference over this jointspace. Most commonly used alignment models, such as the IBM models and HMM-based aligner are unsupervised learners, and can only capture simple distortion features and lexical translational features due to the high complexity of the structure prediction space. On the other hand, the CRFbased NER models are trained on manually annotated data, and admit richer sequence and lexic</context>

(2012) presented a cyclic CRF model very similar to our BI-NER model, and performed approximate inference using loopy belief propagation. The feature-rich CRF formulation of bilingual edge potentials in their model is much more powerful than our simple PMI-based bilingual edge model. Adding a richer bilingual edge model might well further improve our results, and this is a possible direction for further experimentation. However, a big drawback of this approach is that training such a feature-rich model requires manually annotated bilingual NER data, which can be prohibitively expensive to generate. </context>

It is straightforward to incorporate an additional global consistency model into our model for further improvements. Our joint alignment and NER decoding approach is inspired by prior work on improving alignment quality through encouraging agreement between bi-directional models (Liang et al., 2006; DeNero and Macherey, 2011). Instead of enforcing agreement in the alignment space based on best sequences found by Viterbi, we could opt to encourage agreement between posterior probability distributions, which is related to the posterior regularization work by Grac¸a et al.

We report results of adding neighborhood constraints to our model in Section 6. 4 Experimental Setup We evaluate on the large OntoNotes (v4.0) corpus (Hovy et al., 2006) which contains manually 1077 annotated NER tags for both Chinese and English. Document pairs are sentence aligned using the Champollion Tool Kit (Ma, 2006). After discarding sentences with no aligned counterpart, a total of 402 documents and 8,249 parallel sentence pairs were used for evaluation. We will refer to this evaluation set as full-set. We use odd-numbered documents as the dev set and evennumbered documents as the blind test set. We did not perform parameter tuning on the dev set to optimize performance, instead we fix the initial learning rate to 0.5 and maximum iterations to 1,000 in all DD experiments. We only use the dev set for model development. The Stanford CRF-based NER tagger was used as the monolingual component in our models </context>

Without sufficient context it can be difficult to distinguish the two; however, in Chinese, these two senses are disambiguated: “乔丹” as a last name, and “约旦” as a country name. In this work, we first develop a bilingual NER model (denoted as BI-NER) by embedding two monolingual CRF-based NER models into a larger undirected graphical model, and introduce additional edge factors based on word alignment (WA). Because the new bilingual model contains many cyclic cliques, exact inference is intractable. We employ a dual decomposition (DD) inference algorithm (Bertsekas, 1999; Rush et al., 2010) for performing approximate inference.
