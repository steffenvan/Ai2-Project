We propose a method for automated gen-

three types of lexical constraints as build-

of sounds or spellings of the original word
and the substitute, a constraint requiring
the substitute to be a taboo word, and con-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9998595">
Incongruity and taboo meanings are typical ingre-
dients of humor. When used in the proper context,
the expression of contrasting or odd meanings can
induce surprise, confusion or embarrassment and,
thus, make people laugh. While methods from
computational linguistics can be used to estimate
the capability of words and phrases to induce in-
congruity or to evoke taboo meanings, computa-
tional generation of humorous texts has remained
a great challenge.
In this paper we propose a method for auto-
mated generation of adult humor by lexical re-
placement. We consider a setting where a short
text is provided to the system, such as an instant
message, and the task is to make the text funny by
replacing one word in it. Our approach is based

on careful introduction of incongruity and taboo
words to induce humor.
We propose three types of lexical constraints
as building blocks of humorous word substitu-
tion. (1) The form constraints turn the text into
a pun. The constraints thus concern the similarity
of sounds or spellings of the original word and the
substitute. (2) The taboo constraint requires the
substitute to be a taboo word. This is a well-known
feature in some jokes. We hypothesize that the ef-
fectiveness of humorous lexical replacement can
be increased with the introduction of taboo con-
straints. (3) Finally, the context constraints con-
cern the position and context of the replacement.
Our assumption is that a suitably positioned
substitution propagates the tabooness (defined
here as the capability to evoke taboo meanings)
to phrase level and amplifies the semantic con-
trast with the original text. Our second concrete
hypothesis is that the context constraints further
boost the funniness.
We evaluated the above hypotheses empirically
by generating 300 modified versions of SMS mes-
sages and having each of them evaluated by 90
subjects using a crowdsourcing platform. The
results show a statistically highly significant in-
crease of funniness and agreement with the use of
the humorous lexical constraints.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
In Section 2, we give a short overview of theoreti-
cal background and related work on humor gener-
ation. In Section 3, we present the three types of
constraints for lexical replacement to induce hu-
mor. The empirical evaluation is presented in Sec-
tion 4. Section 5 contains concluding remarks.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999140155172414">
Humor, Incongruity and Tabooness A set of
theories known as incongruity theory is probably
the most influential approach to the study of hu-
mor and laughter. The concept of incongruity, first
described by Beattie (1971), is related to the per-
ception of incoherence, semantic contrast, or inap-
propriateness, even though there is no precise and
agreed definition. Raskin (1985) formulated the
incongruity concept in terms of script opposition.
This has been developed further, into the Gen-
eral Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo and Raskin,
1991). A cognitive treatment of incongruity in hu-
mor is described by Summerfelt et al. (2010).
One specific form of jokes frequently discussed
in the literature consists of the so called forced
reinterpretation jokes. E.g.:
Alcohol isn’t a problem, it’s a solution...
Just ask any chemist.
In his analysis of forced reinterpretation jokes,
Ritchie (2002) emphasises the distinction between
three different elements of the joke processing:
CONFLICT is the initial perception of incompati-
bility between punchline and setup according to
the initial obvious interpretation; CONTRAST de-
notes the perception of the contrastive connec-
tion between the two interpretations; while INAP-
PROPRIATENESS refers to the intrinsic oddness or
tabooness characterising the funny interpretation.
All three concepts are often connected to the no-
tion of incongruity.
In his integrative approach to humor theories,
Martin (2007) discusses the connection between
tabooness and incongruity resolution. In partic-
ular, he discusses the salience hypothesis (Gold-
stein et al., 1972; Attardo and Raskin, 1991), ac-
cording to which “the purpose of aggressive and
sexual elements in jokes is to make salient the in-
formation needed to resolve the incongruity”.
Humor Generation In previous research on
computational humor generation, puns are often
used as the core of more complex humorous texts,
for example as punchlines of simple jokes (Raskin
and Attardo, 1994; Levison and Lessard, 1992;
Venour, 1999; McKay, 2002). This differs from
our setting, where we transform an existing short
text into a punning statement.
Only few humor generation systems have been
empirically evaluated. The JAPE program (Bin-
sted et al., 1997) produces specific types of pun-
ning riddles. HAHAcronym (Stock and Strap-
parava, 2002) automatically generates humorous
versions of existing acronyms, or produces a new
funny acronym, starting with concepts provided
by the user. The evaluations indicate statistical
significance, but the test settings are relatively spe-
cific. Below, we will present an approach to eval-
uation that allows comparison of different systems
in the same generation task.

3 Lexical Constraints for Humorous
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.763445">
Word Substitution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999751642857143">
The procedure gets as input a segment of English
text (e.g.: “Let everything turn well in your life!”).
Then it performs a single word substitution (e.g:
‘life’ → ‘wife’), and returns the resulting text. To
make it funny, the word replacement is performed
according to a number of lexical constraints, to be
described below. Additionally, the text can be ap-
pended with a phrase such as “I mean ‘life’ not
‘wife’.” The task of humor generation is thus re-
duced to a task of lexical selection. The adopted
task for humor generation is an extension of the
one described by Valitutti (2011).
We define three types of lexical constraints for
this task, which will be described next.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996738">
3.1 Form Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974388888889">
Form constraints (FORM) require that the original
word and its substitute are similar inform. This
turns the text given as input into a kind of pun,
“text which relies crucially on phonetic similarity
for its humorous effect” (Ritchie, 2005).
Obviously, simply replacing a word potentially
results in a text that induces “conflict” (and con-
fusion) in the audience. Using a phonetically sim-
ilar word as a replacement, however, makes the
statement pseudo-ambiguous, since the original
intended meaning can also be recovered. There
then are two “conflicting” and “contrasting” inter-
pretations — the literal one and the original one —
increasing the likelihood of humorous incongruity.
Requiring the substitute to share part-of-speech
with the original word works in this direction too,
and additionally increases the likelihood that the
resulting text is a valid English statement.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983958333333">
Implementation We adopt an extended defini-
tion of punning and also consider orthographically
similar or rhyming words as possible substitutes.
Two words are considered orthographically
similar if one word is obtained with a single char-
acter deletion, addition, or replacement from the
other one.
We call two words phonetically similar if their
phonetic transcription is orthographically similar
according to the above definition.
Two words rhyme if they have same positions of
tonic accent, and if they are phonetically identical
from the most stressed syllable to the end of the
word.
Our implementation of these constraints uses
the WordNet lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998)
and CMU pronunciation dictionary1. The lat-
ter also provides a collection of words not nor-
mally contained in standard English dictionaries,
but commonly used in informal language. This in-
creases the space of potential replacements. We
use the TreeTagger2 POS tagger in order to con-
sider only words with the same part-of-speech of
the word to be replaced.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996491">
3.2 Taboo Constraint
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907368421053">
Taboo constraint (TABOO) requires that the sub-
stitute word is a taboo word or frequently used
in taboo expressions, insults, or vulgar expres-
sions. Taboo words “represent a class of emo-
tionally arousing references with respect to body
products, body parts, sexual acts, ethnic or racial
insults, profanity, vulgarity, slang, and scatology”
(Jay et al., 2008), and they directly introduce “in-
appropriateness” to the text.
Implementation We collected a list of 700
taboo words. A first subset contains words man-
ually selected from the domain SEXUALITY of
WordNet-Domains (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000).
A second subset was collected from the Web, and
contains words commonly used as insults. Finally,
a third subset was collected from a website post-
ing examples of funny autocorrection mistakes3
and includes words that are not directly referring
to taboos (e.g.: ‘stimulation’) or often retrieved in

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99276">
3.3 Contextual Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907513513514">
Contextual constraints (CONT) require that the
substitution takes place at the end of the text, and
in a locally coherent manner.
By local coherence we mean that the substitute
word forms a feasible phrase with its immediate
predecessor. If this is not the case, then the text
is likely to make little sense. On the other hand,
if this is the case, then the taboo meaning is po-
tentially expanded to the phrase level. This in-
troduces a stronger semantic “contrast” and thus
probably contributes to making the text funnier.
The semantic contrast is potentially even stronger
if the taboo word comes as a surprise in the end
of a seemingly innocent text. The humorous effect
then is similar to the one of the forced reinterpre-
tation jokes.
Implementation Local coherence is imple-
mented using n-grams. In the case of languages
that are read from left to right, such as English,
expectations will be built by the left-context of the
expected word. To estimate the level of expecta-
tion triggered by a left-context, we rely on a vast
collection of n-grams, the 2012 Google Books n-
grams collection4 (Michel et al., 2011) and com-
pute the cohesion of each n-gram, by comparing
their expected frequency (assuming word inde-
pence), to their observed number of occurrences.
A subsequent Student t-test allows to assign a
measure of cohesion to each n-gram (Doucet and
Ahonen-Myka, 2006). We use a substitute word
only if its cohesion with the previous word is high.
In order to use consistent natural language and
avoid time or location-based variations, we fo-
cused on contemporary American English. Thus
we only used the subsection of Google bigrams
for American English, and ignored all the statis-
tics stemming from books published before 1990.

adding the tabooness constraint to the form con-
straints, and the potential effect of further adding
contextual constraints. I.e., we consider three in-
creasingly constrained conditions: (1) substitution
according only to the form constraints (FORM),
(2) substitution according to both form and taboo
constraints (FORM+TABOO), and (3) substitution
according to form, taboo and context constraints
(FORM+TABOO+CONT).
One of the reasons for the choice of taboo words
as lexical constraint is that they allows the system
to generate humorous text potentially appreciated
by young adults, which are the majority of crowd-
sourcing users (Ross et al., 2010). We applied the
humor generation method on the first 5000 mes-
sages of NUS SMS Corpus6, a corpus of real SMS
messages (Chen and Kan, 2012).
We carried out every possible lexical replace-
ment under each of the three conditions mentioned
above, one at a time, so that the resulting mes-
sages have exactly one word substituted. We then
randomly picked 100 such modified messages for
each of the conditions. Table 1 shows two example
outputs of the humor generator under each of the
three experimental conditions. These two exam-
ples are the least funny and the funniest message
according to the empirical evaluation (see below).
For evaluation, this dataset of 300 messages
was randomly divided into groups of 20 mes-
sages each. We recruited 208 evaluators using
the crowdsourcing service, asking each subject to
evaluate one such group of 20 messages. Each
message in each group was judged by 90 different
participants.
We asked subjects to assess individual messages
for their funniness on a scale from 1 to 5. For the
analysis of the results, we then measured the effec-
tiveness of the constraints using two derived vari-
ables: the Collective Funniness (CF) of a message
is its mean funniness, while its Upper Agreement
(UA(t)) is the fraction of funniness scores greater
than or equal to a given threshold t. To rank the
generated messages, we take the product of Col-
lective Funniness and Upper Agreement UA(3)
and call it the overall Humor Effectiveness (HE).
In order to identify and remove potential scam-
mers in the crowdsourcing system, we simply
asked subjects to select the last word in the mes-

sage. If a subject failed to answer correctly more
than three times all her judgements were removed.
As a result, 2% of judgments were discarded as
untrusted. From the experiment, we then have
a total of 26 534 trusted assessments of mes-
sages, 8 400 under FORM condition, 8 551 un-
der FORM+TABOO condition, and 8 633 under
FORM+TABOO+CONT condition.
The Collective Funniness of messages in-
creases, on average, from 2.29 under con-
dition FORM to 2.98 when the taboo con-
straint is added (FORM+TABOO), and further to
3.20 when the contextual constraints are added
(FORM+TABOO+CONT) (Table 2). The Upper
Agreement UA(4) increases from 0.18 to 0.36 and
to 0.43, respectively.
We analyzed the distributions of Collective
Funniness values of messages, as well as the
distributions of their Upper Agreements (for
all values from UA(2) to UA(5)) under the
three conditions. According to the one-sided
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, both Collective Funni-
ness and all Upper Agreements increase from
FORM to FORM+TABOO and from FORM+TABOO
to FORM+TABOO+CONT statistically significantly
(in all cases p &lt; .002). Table 3 shows p-values
associated with all pairwise comparisons.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989409090909">
We have proposed a new approach for the study
of computational humor generation by lexical re-
placement. The generation task is based on a sim-
ple form of punning, where a given text is modi-
fied by replacing one word with a similar one.
We proved empirically that, in this setting, hu-
mor generation is more effective when using a list
of taboo words. The other strong empirical re-
sult regards the context of substitutions: using bi-
grams to model people’s expectations, and con-
straining the position of word replacement to the
end of the text, increases funniness significantly.
This is likely because of the form of surprise they
induce. At best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that these aspects of humor generation have
been successfully evaluated with a crowdsourcing
system and, thus, in a relatively quick and eco-
nomical way.
The statistical significance is particularly high,
even though there were several limitations in the
experimental setting. For example, as explained
in Section 3.2, the employed word list was built

from different sources and contains words not di-
rectly referring to taboo meanings and, thus, not
widely recognizable as “taboo words”. Further-
more, the possible presence of crowd-working
scammers (only partially filtered by the gold stan-
dard questions) could have reduced the statistical
power of our analysis. Finally, the adopted humor
generation task (based on a single word substitu-
tion) is extremely simple and the constraints might
have not been sufficiently capable to produce a de-
tectable increase of humor appreciation.
The statistically strong results that we obtained
can make this evaluation approach attractive for
related tasks. In our methodology, we focused at-
tention to the correlation between the parameters
of the system (in our case, the constraints used in
lexical selection) and the performance of humor
generation. We used a multi-dimensional mea-
sure of humorous effect (in terms of funniness and
agreement) to measure subtly different aspects of
the humorous response. We then adopted a com-
parative setting, where we can measure improve-
ments in the performance across different systems
or variants.
In the future, it would be interesting to use
a similar setting to empirically investigate more
subtle ways to generate humor, potentially with
weaker effects but still recognizable in this set-
ting. For instance, we would like to investigate
the use of other word lists besides taboo domains
and the extent to which the semantic relatedness
itself could contribute to the humorous effect.
The current techniques can be improved, too,
in various ways. In particular, we plan to extend
the use of n-grams to larger contexts and consider
more fine-grained tuning of other constraints, too.
One goal is to apply the proposed methodology
to isolate, on one hand, parameters for inducing
incongruity and, on the other hand, parameters for
making the incongruity funny.
Finally, we are interested in estimating the prob-
ability to induce a humor response by using differ-
ent constraints. This would offer a novel way to
intentionally control the humorous effect.

<abstract confidence="0.982414352941176">We propose a method for automated generation of adult humor by lexical replacement and present empirical evaluation results of the obtained humor. We propose three types of lexical constraints as building blocks of humorous word substitution: constraints concerning the similarity of sounds or spellings of the original word and the substitute, a constraint requiring the substitute to be a taboo word, and constraints concerning the position and context of the replacement. Empirical evidence from extensive user studies indicates that these constraints can increase the effectiveness of humor generation significantly.</abstract>

Humor Generation In previous research on computational humor generation, puns are often used as the core of more complex humorous texts, for example as punchlines of simple jokes (Raskin and Attardo, 1994; Levison and Lessard, 1992; Venour, 1999; McKay, 2002). This differs from our setting, where we transform an existing short text into a punning statement. Only few humor generation systems have been empirically evaluated. The JAPE program (Binsted et al., 1997) produces specific types of punning riddles. HAHAcronym (Stock and Strapparava, 2002) automatically generates humorous versions of existing acronyms, or produces a new funny acronym, starting with concepts provided by the user. The evaluations indicate statistical significance, but the test settings are relatively specific. Below, we will present an approach to evaluation that allows comparison of different systems in the same generation task. 3 Lexical Constraints for Humorous Word Substitution The procedure gets as input a segment of English text (e.g.: “Let everything turn well in your life</context>

One of the reasons for the choice of taboo words as lexical constraint is that they allows the system to generate humorous text potentially appreciated by young adults, which are the majority of crowdsourcing users (Ross et al., 2010). We applied the humor generation method on the first 5000 messages of NUS SMS Corpus6, a corpus of real SMS messages (Chen and Kan, 2012). We carried out every possible lexical replacement under each of the three conditions mentioned above, one at a time, so that the resulting messages have exactly one word substituted. We then randomly picked 100 such modified messages for each of the conditions. Table 1 shows two example outputs of the humor generator under each of the three experimental conditions. These two examples are the least funny and the funniest message according to the empirical evaluation (see below). For evaluation, this dataset of 300 messages was randomly divided into groups of 20 messages each. We recruited 208</context>

To estimate the level of expectation triggered by a left-context, we rely on a vast collection of n-grams, the 2012 Google Books ngrams collection4 (Michel et al., 2011) and compute the cohesion of each n-gram, by comparing their expected frequency (assuming word indepence), to their observed number of occurrences. A subsequent Student t-test allows to assign a measure of cohesion to each n-gram (Doucet and Ahonen-Myka, 2006). We use a substitute word only if its cohesion with the previous word is high. In order to use consistent natural language and avoid time or location-based variations, we focused on contemporary American English.

Two words are considered orthographically similar if one word is obtained with a single character deletion, addition, or replacement from the other one. We call two words phonetically similar if their phonetic transcription is orthographically similar according to the above definition. Two words rhyme if they have same positions of tonic accent, and if they are phonetically identical from the most stressed syllable to the end of the word. Our implementation of these constraints uses the WordNet lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998) and CMU pronunciation dictionary1. The latter also provides a collection of words not normally contained in standard English dictionaries, but commonly used in informal language. This increases the space of potential replacements. We use the TreeTagger2 POS tagger in order to consider only words with the same part-of-speech of the word to be replaced. 3.2 Taboo Constraint Taboo constraint (TABOO) requires that the substitute word is a taboo word or frequently used in taboo expressions, insults, or vulgar expressions.

Taboo words “represent a class of emotionally arousing references with respect to body products, body parts, sexual acts, ethnic or racial insults, profanity, vulgarity, slang, and scatology” (Jay et al., 2008), and they directly introduce “inappropriateness” to the text. Implementation We collected a list of 700 taboo words. A first subset contains words manually selected from the domain SEXUALITY of WordNet-Domains (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000). A second subset was collected from the Web, and contains words commonly used as insults. Finally, a third subset was collected from a website posting examples of funny autocorrection mistakes3 and includes words that are not directly referring to taboos (e.g.: ‘stimulation’) or often retrieved in 1available at http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/ cgi-bin/cmudict </context>

In his analysis of forced reinterpretation jokes, Ritchie (2002) emphasises the distinction between three different elements of the joke processing: CONFLICT is the initial perception of incompatibility between punchline and setup according to the initial obvious interpretation; CONTRAST denotes the perception of the contrastive connection between the two interpretations; while INAPPROPRIATENESS refers to the intrinsic oddness or tabooness characterising the funny interpretation. All three concepts are often connected to the notion of incongruity. In his integrative approach to humor theories, Martin (2007) discusses the connection between tabooness and in</context>

This turns the text given as input into a kind of pun, “text which relies crucially on phonetic similarity for its humorous effect” (Ritchie, 2005). Obviously, simply replacing a word potentially results in a text that induces “conflict” (and confusion) in the audience. Using a phonetically similar word as a replacement, however, makes the statement pseudo-ambiguous, since the original intended meaning can also be recovered. There then are two “conflicting” and “contrasting” interpretations — the literal one and the original one — increasing the likelihood of humorous incongruity. Requiring the substitute to share part-of-speech with the original word works in this direction too, and additionally increases the likelihood that the resulti</context>

I.e., we consider three increasingly constrained conditions: (1) substitution according only to the form constraints (FORM), (2) substitution according to both form and taboo constraints (FORM+TABOO), and (3) substitution according to form, taboo and context constraints (FORM+TABOO+CONT). One of the reasons for the choice of taboo words as lexical constraint is that they allows the system to generate humorous text potentially appreciated by young adults, which are the majority of crowdsourcing users (Ross et al., 2010). We applied the humor generation method on the first 5000 messages of NUS SMS Corpus6, a corpus of real SMS messages (Chen and Kan, 2012). We carried out every possible lexical replacement under each of the three conditions mentioned above, one at a time, so that the resulting messages have exactly one word substituted. We then randomly picked 100 such modified messages for each of the conditions. Table 1 shows two example outputs of the humor generator under each of the three experimental conditions. These two examples are the least funny and the funniest message according to the empirical e</context>

Humor Generation In previous research on computational humor generation, puns are often used as the core of more complex humorous texts, for example as punchlines of simple jokes (Raskin and Attardo, 1994; Levison and Lessard, 1992; Venour, 1999; McKay, 2002). This differs from our setting, where we transform an existing short text into a punning statement. Only few humor generation systems have been empirically evaluated. The JAPE program (Binsted et al., 1997) produces specific types of punning riddles. HAHAcronym (Stock and Strapparava, 2002) automatically generates humorous versions of existing acronyms, or produces a new funny acronym, starting with concepts provided by the user. The evaluations indicate statistical significance, but the test settings are relatively specific. Below, we will present an approach to evaluation that allows comparison of different systems in the same generation task. 3 Lexical Constraints for Humorous Word Substitution The procedure gets as input a segment of English text (e.g.: “Let everything turn well in your life!”).

The concept of incongruity, first described by Beattie (1971), is related to the perception of incoherence, semantic contrast, or inappropriateness, even though there is no precise and agreed definition. Raskin (1985) formulated the incongruity concept in terms of script opposition. This has been developed further, into the General Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo and Raskin, 1991). A cognitive treatment of incongruity in humor is described by Summerfelt et al. (2010). One specific form of jokes frequently discussed in the literature consists of the so called forced reinterpretation jokes. E.g.: Alcohol isn’t a problem, it’s a solution... Just ask any chemist.
