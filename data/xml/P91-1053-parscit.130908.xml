1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998787875">
To resolve or not to resolve, that is the structural ambigu-
ity dilemma. The traditional wisdom is to disambiguate only
when it matters in terms of the meaning of the utterance, and
to do so using the computationally least costly information.
NLP work on PP-attachment has followed this wisdom, and
much effort has been focused on formulating structural and
lexical strategies for resolving noun-phrase and verb-phrase
(NP-PP vs. VP-PP) attachment ambiguity (e.g. [8, 11]). In
one study, statistical analysis of the distribution of lexical
items in a very large text yielded 78% correct parses while
two humans achieved just 85%[5]. The close performance
of machine and human led the authors to pose two issues
that will be addressed in this paper: is the predictive power
of distributional data due to &amp;quot;a complementation relation, a
modification relation, or something else&amp;quot;, and what charac-
terizes the attachments that escape prediction?

2. Pragmatically ambiguous PPs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998403818181818">
Although structural and lexical rules alone do not suffice to
disambiguate all kinds of PPs, discourse modelling is viewed
as computationally costly (cf. [1]). The debate over resolu-
tion strategies is not simply about practicality, but rather,
at stake is the notion of what exactly it means for a PP
to attach. This paper defends discourse-level strategies by
arguing that a certain PP-attachment ambiguity, sentential
vs. verb-phrase (S-PP vs. VP-PP), reflects a third kind
of relation that is pragmatic in nature. As noted in [11],
context-dependent preferences cannot be computed a priori,
so pragmatic PP-attachment ambiguities are among those
that defy structural and lexical rules for disambiguation.
Another criticism aimed at discourse-level approaches is
that pragmatic ambiguities can be left unresolved because
they do not affect the meaning of an utterance. In the case of
S-PPs and VP-PPs, however, the linguistic evidence points
to significant meaning differences (section 3). This paper
offers a unified account of the linguistic behavior of these
PPs which is expressed in a new formalism (section 4), and
concludes that the resolution of pragmatic PP-attachment
ambiguity is necessary for language understanding (section
5).

3. The need to disambiguate
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.975437">
3.1 Linguistic evidence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.667673523809524">
Linguists have identified instrumental, locative and temporal
adverbial PPs as the most structurally unrestricted, context-
dependent types of PPs [6, 101. These kinds of PPs often can
attach either to S or VP. Thus, Warren sang in the park can
be paraphrased as either Where Warren sang was in the park
or What Warren did in the park was sing. Kuno argues that
the former interpretation involves a place-identifying VP-PP,
and the latter a scene-setting S-PP. Also, the following mean-
ing differences occur:
given-new/theme-rheme S-PPs are given/themes, VP-
PPs are new/themes.
preposability S-PPs can be preposed, preposed VP-PPs
sound awkward and often change meaning.
entailments S-PP utterances have no entailments of the
utterance without the PP. For VP-PPs, the utterance
without the PP is entailed only if the utterance is affir-
mative.
negation S-PPs always lie outside the scope of negation,
VP-PPs may or may not lie inside the scope of negation.
These aspects of meaning cannot be dismissed as spurious.
Consider Kuno&apos;s pair of sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.92316725">
• Jim didn&apos;t visit museums in Paris,
but he did in London (1).
• Jim didn&apos;t visit museums in Paris:
he visited museums in London (2).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998450666666667">
Kuno assigns (1) the interpretation in which the PPs are
sentential and two events are described: although Jim visited
museums only in London, he also went to Paris. Sentence (2)
is assigned the reading that Jim was not in Paris at all but
went only to London where he visited museums. The PPs
are verb-phrasal and only one event is being talked about.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999912">
3.2 A pragmatic relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999648304347826">
The behavior of these adverbial PPs reflects neither a com-
plementation nor a modification relation. If attachment is
dictated by complementation, an instrumental PP should al-
ways appear as an argument of the verb predicate in logical
form. But this sacrifices entailments for affirmative VP-PP
utterances; `butter(toast,knife)&apos; does not logically entail &apos;but-
ter(toast)&apos; [2, 3]. If construed as a modification relation, at-
tachment is redundant with phrase structure information and
curiously depends on whether the subject, or any other con-
stituent outside the VP, is or is not modified by the PP. There
may well be reasons to preserve these relations in the syn.-
tactic structure, but they are not the relations that desrib6
the behavior of pragmatically ambiguous PPs.
The linguistic evidence suggests that the S-PP vs. VP-PP
distinction reflects a pragmatic relation, namely a discourse
entity specification relation where specify means to refer in a
model [4]. Since this relation cannot be represented by tra-
ditional phrase structure trees, the meaning differences that
distinguish the two kinds of PPs must be captured by a dif-
ferent formal structure. The proposed event formalism treats
utterances with adverbial PPs as descriptions of events and
is adapted from Davidson&apos;s logical form for action sentences
[2] using restricted quantification.

status to all modifiers, thereby allowing events, like ob-
jects and people, to be described by any combination of
their properties. This flattening of the argument structure
clears the way for using restricted quantification to &apos;elevate&apos;
some predicates to event-specifying status. Following [12],
the structure 3eP restricts the range of e to those entities

that satisfy P, an arbitrarily complex predicate of the form
AuPi (xl , u) A ... A P,n(z,n, u). In expressions of the form
(3e : AuPi (xi , u)A...AP,n(z,n, u))[Ri (yi , e)A...ARn(yn, e)],
event-specifying predicates appear in the A-expression while
the other predicates remain in the predication Re. Here-
after, the term event description refers to the A-expression,
and event predication to the sentence predicate Re. The two
parts together comprise an event representation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999262">
4.2 Applying the formalism
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993011">
In the formalism, (3) represents sentence (1) and (4), (2):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99978275">
(3e : AuAgt(J, u) A Loc(P, u))-1,4ct(v, e) A Ob j (m, e)] A
(3e : )tuAgt(J, u) A Loc(L, u))[Act(v, e) A Ob j (m , e)] (3)
—.(3e : )tuAgt(J,u) A Act(v,u) A Obj(m, u))[Loc(P, e)] A
(3e : AuAgt(J, u) A Act(v, u) A Obj(m, u))[Loc(L, e)] (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99911631372549">
In (3), the thematic S-PPs (in bold) are represented in the
event descriptions, whereas in (4), the nonthematic VP-PPs
are in the event predications. Now the well-worn given-new
distinction can be replaced by the more precise distinction
made by the event formalism. Event-specifying PPs appear
in the event description and contribute to the specification
of an event entity in the discourse model. Predication PPs
appear in the event predication and convey new information
about the specified entity.
The formalism shows how preposing a VP-PP can change
the meaning of the utterance. If the PPs in (2) are pre-
posed, as in In Paris, Jim didn&apos;t visit museums: in Lon-
don, he visited museums, the original reading is lost. This is
shown in the representation: —.(3e : AuAgt(J, u) A Act(v, u) A
Obj(m, u) A Loc(P, u)) A (3e : AuAgt(J, u) A Act(v, u) A
Obj(m, u) A Loc(L, u)). Since the event descriptions conflict—
one event cannot take place in two places— this sentence can
no longer be understood as describing a single event.
The formalism also shows different effects of negation on
event-specifying and predication PPs. Sentence (2) denies
the existence of any &apos;Jim visiting museums in Paris&apos; event,
so the quantifier lies within the scope of negation in (4). In
(3) negation scopes only the event predication; sentence (1)
expresses a negative fact about one event, and an affirmative
fact about another. In general, a PP that lies outside the
scope of negation appears in the description Pu of a repre-
sentation of form (3e : )tuPu)—[Re]. A PP that lies inside
appears in the predication Re of form —,(3e : AuPu)[Re].
Finally, the formalism lends insight into differences in en-
tailments. The following entailment relationship holds for
affirmative VP-PP sentences, where Rn(yn, e) represents the
PP predicate: (3e : AuPu)[Ri (yi , e) A... A R.-1(y.-1, e) A
Rn(y., e)] (3e : AuPu)[Ri (yi , e) A ... A Rn—i (Yn-1 901
A PP predicate Rn(yn, e) in a negated event predication
may or may not be negated, so the entailment for negative
VP-PP sentences is blocked: (3e: AuPu)--1[Ri (y1, e) A ... A
Rn-1 (tin-1 e) A Rn(yn, e)] pt. (3e : AuPu)—.[Ri (yi , e) A ... A
Rn-1(yn-1, e)]. Why S-PP sentences have no entailments is
a separate matter. Eliminating an event-specifying PP from
an event description yields a representation with a different
description. Intuitively, it seems desirable that no entail-
ment relations hold between different types of entities. The
formalism preserves this condition.
The proposed formalism succeeds in capturing the dis-
course entity specification relation and lends itself naturally
to processing in an NLP system that takes seriously the dy-
namic nature of context. Such a system would for each utter-
ance construct an event representation, search for a discourse
entity that satisfies the event description, and use the event
predication to update the information about that entity in
the discourse model.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999731875">
A preliminary algorithm for processing highly ambiguous
PPs has been worked out in [7]. The algorithm uses in-
tonation [9], centering and word order information to con-
struct and process event representations in a discourse model
structured after [4]. The wider applicability of the two-part
event formalism has not yet been tested. Nevertheless, one
conclusion is that the value of resolving any structural am-
biguity can only be measured in terms of the semantics of
the structural formalism itself. In the case of VP-PP vs.
S-PP ambiguity, an NLP system must not idly wait for syn-
tax to choose how a PP should pragmatically function. The
traditional wisdom— find the meaning and do so efficiently—
instead suggests that more productive than demanding of
syntax unreasonably diverse expressive powers is to search
for direct linguistic correlates of pragmatic meaning that can
be efficiently encoded in a dynamic pragmatic formalism.

Davidson assigns equal status to all modifiers, thereby allowing events, like objects and people, to be described by any combination of their properties. This flattening of the argument structure clears the way for using restricted quantification to &apos;elevate&apos; some predicates to event-specifying status. Following [12], the structure 3eP restricts the range of e to those entities 351 that satisfy P, an arbitrarily complex predicate of the form AuPi (xl , u) A ... A P,n(z,n, u). In expressions of the form (3e : AuPi (xi , u)A...AP,n(z,n, u))[Ri (yi , e)A...ARn(yn, e)], event-specifying predicates appear in the A-expression while the other predicates remain in the predication Re. Hereafter, the term event description refers to the A-expression, and event predication to the sentence predicate Re. The two parts together comprise an event representation. 4.2 Applying the formalism In the formalism, (3) represent</context>
