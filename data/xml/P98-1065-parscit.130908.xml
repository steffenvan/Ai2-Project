To segment texts in thematic units, we
present here how a basic principle
relying on word distribution can be
applied on different kind of texts. We
start from an existing method well
adapted for scientific texts, and we
propose its adaptation to other kinds of
texts by using semantic links between
words. These relations are found in a
lexical network, automatically built from
a large corpus. We will compare their
results and give criteria to choose the

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999647225">
Text segmentation according to a topical
criterion is a useful process in many
applications, such as text summarization or
information extraction task. Approaches that
address this problem can be classified in
knowledge-based approaches or word-based
approaches. Knowledge-based systems as
Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) require an
extensive manual knowledge engineering
effort to create the knowledge base (semantic
network and/or frames) and this is only
possible in very limited and well-known
domains.
To overcome this limitation, and to process a
large amount of texts, word-based approaches
have been developed. Hearst (1997) and
Masson (1995) make use of the word
distribution in a text to find a thematic
segmentation. These works are well adapted to
technical or scientific texts characterized by a
specific vocabulary. To process narrative or
expository texts such as newspaper articles,
Kozima&apos;s (1993) and Morris and Hirst&apos;s
(1991) approaches are based on lexical
cohesion computed from a lexical network.
These methods depend on the presence of the
text vocabulary inside their network. So, to
avoid any restriction about domains in such
kinds of texts, we present here a mixed method
that augments Masson&apos;s system (1995), based
on word distribution, by using knowledge
represented by a lexical co-occurrence
network automatically built from a corpus. By
making some experiments with these two latter
systems, we show that adding lexical
knowledge is not sufficient on its own to have
an all-purpose method, able to process either
technical texts or narratives. We will then
propose some solutions to choose the more
suitable method.

2. Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945787878788">
In this paper, we propose to apply one and the
same basic idea to find topic boundaries in
texts, whatever kind they are,
scientific/technical articles or newspaper
articles. This main idea is to consider smallest
textual units, here the paragraphs, and try to
link them to adjacent similar units to create
larger thematic units. Each unit is
characterized by a set of descriptors, i.e. single
and compound content words, defining a
vector. Descriptor values are the number of
occurrences of the words in the unit, modified
by the word distribution in the text. Then, each
successive units are compared through their
descriptors to know if they refer to a same
topic or not.
This kind of approach is well adapted to
scientific articles, often characterized by
domain technical term reiteration since there is
often no synonym for such specific terms. But,
we will show that it is less efficient on
narratives. Although the same basic principle
about word distribution applies, topics are not
so easily detectable. In fact, narrative or
expository texts often refer to a same entity
with a large set of different words. Indeed,
authors avoid repetitions and redundancies by
using hyperonyms, synonyms and
referentially equivalent expressions.
To deal with this specificity, we have
developed another method that augments the
first method by making use of information
coming from a lexical co-occurrence network.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997384">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985025">
This network allows a mutual reinforcement of
descriptors that are different but strongly
related when occurring in the same unit.
Moreover, it is also possible to create new
descriptors for units in order to link units
sharing semantically close words.
In the two methods, topic boundaries are
detected by a standard distance measure
between each pair of adjacent vectors. Thus,
the segmentation process produces a text
representation with thematic blocks including
paragraphs about the same topic.
The two methods have been tested on different
kinds of texts. We will discuss these results and
give criteria to choose the more suitable
method according to text characteristics.

3. Pre-processing of the texts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991056">
As we are interested in the thematic dimension
of the texts, they have to be represented by
their significant features from that point of
view. So, we only hold for each text the
lemmatized form of its nouns, verbs and
adjectives. This has been done by combining
existing tools. MtSeg from the Multext project
presented in Veronis and Khouri (1995) is
used for segmenting the raw texts. As
compound nouns are less polysemous than
single ones, we have added to MtSeg the
ability to identify 2300 compound nouns. We
have retained the most frequent compound
nouns in 11 years of the French Le Monde
newspaper. They have been collected with the
INTEX tool of Silberztein (1994). The part of
speech tagger TreeTagger of Schmid (1994) is
applied to disambiguate the lexical category of
the words and to provide their lemmatized
form. The selection of the meaningful words,
which do not include proper nouns and
abbreviations, ends the pre-processing. This
one is applied to the texts both for building
the collocation network and for their thematic
segmentation.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.743473" genericHeader="method">
4. Building the collocation network
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980575">
Our segmentation mechanism relies on
semantic relations between words. In order to
evaluate it, we have built a network of lexical
collocations from a large corpus. Our corpus,
whose size is around 39 million words, is made
up of 24 months of the Le Monde newspaper
taken from 1990 to 1994. The collocations
have been calculated according to the method
described in Church and Hanks (1990) by
moving a window on the texts. The corpus was
pre-processed as described above, which
induces a 63% cut. The window in which the
collocations have been collected is 20 words
wide and takes into account the boundaries of
the texts. Moreover, the collocations here are
indifferent to order.
These three choices are motivated by our task
point of view. We are interested in finding if
two words belong to the same thematic
domain. As a topic can be developed in a large
textual unit, it requires a quite large window to
detect these thematic relations. But the process
must avoid jumping across the texts
boundaries as two adjacent texts from the
corpus are rarely related to a same domain.
Lastly, the collocation wl-w2 is equivalent to
the collocation w2-w1 as we only try to
characterize a thematic relation between wl
and w2.
After filtering the non-significant collocations
(collocations with less than 6 occurrences,
which represent 2/3 of the whole), we obtain a
network with approximately 31000 words and
14 million relations. The cohesion between
two words is measured as in Church and Hanks
(1990) by an estimation of the mutual
information based on their collocation
frequency. This value is normalized by the
maximal mutual information with regard to
the corpus, which is given by:

5. Thematic segmentation without
lexical network
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968692444444445">
The first method, based on a numerical
analysis of the vocabulary distribution in the
text, is derived from the method described in
Masson (1995).
A basic discourse unit, here a paragraph, is
represented as a term vector
=(gil,gi2,...,git) where gi is the number of
occurrences of a given descriptor in G.
The descriptors are the words extracted by the
pre-processing of the current text. Term
vectors are weighted. The weighting policy is
tf.idf which is an indicator of the importance
of a term according to its distribution in a text.
It is defined by:
wu = . log cif
where tfij is the number of occurrences of a
descriptor Ti in a paragraph i; dfi is the
number of paragraphs in which Tj occurs and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996608">
393
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995350411764706">
N the total number of paragraphs in the text.
Terms that are scattered over the whole
document are considered to be less important
than those which are concentrated in particular
paragraphs.
Terms that are not reiterated are considered as
non significant to characterize the text topics.
Thus, descriptors whose occurrence counts are
below a threshold are removed. According to
the length of the processed texts, the threshold
is here three occurrences.
The topic boundaries are then detected by a
standard distance measure between all pairs of
adjacent paragraphs: first paragraph is
compared to second paragraph, second one to
third one and so on. The distance measure is
the Dice coefficient, defined for two vectors

the text, whereas high coherence values show
local thematic consistency.

6. Thematic segmentation with
lexical network
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987889235294118">
Texts such as newspaper articles often refer to
a same notion with a large set of different
words linked by semantic or pragmatic
relations. Thus, there is often no reiteration of
terms representative of the text topics and the
first method described before becomes less
efficient. In this case, we modify the vector
representation by adding information coming
from the lexical network.
Modifications act on the vectorial
representation of paragraphs by adding
descriptors and modifying descriptor values.
They aim at bringing together paragraphs
which refer to the same topic and whose words
are not reiterated. The main idea is that, if two
words A and B are linked in the network, then
&amp;quot;when A is present in a text, B is also a little
bit evoked, and vice versa&amp;quot;.
That is to say that when two descriptors of a
text A and B are linked with a weight w in the
lexical network, their weights are reinforced
into the paragraphs to which they
simultaneously belong. Moreover, the missing
descriptor is added in the paragraph if absent.
In case of reinforcement, if the descriptor A is
really present k times and B really present n
times in a paragraph, then we add wn to the
number of A occurrences and wk to the
number of B occurrences. In case of
descriptor addition, the descriptor weight is set
to the number of occurrences of the linked
descriptor multiplied by w. All the couples of
text descriptors are processed using the
original number of their occurrences to
compute modified vector values.
These vector modifications favor emergence
of significant descriptors. If a set of words
belonging to neighboring paragraphs are
linked each other, then they are mutually
reinforced and tend to bring these paragraphs
nearer. If there is no mutual reinforcement, the
vector modifications are not significant.
These modifications are computed before
applying a tf.idf like factor to the vector terms.
The descriptor addition may add many
descriptors in all the text paragraphs because
of the numerous links, even weak, between
words in the network. Thus, the effect of tf.idf
is smoothed by the standard-deviation of the
current descriptor distribution. The resulting
factor is:

Figure 1 shows the results for a newspaper
article from Le Monde made of 8 paragraphs.
The cohesion value associated to a paragraph i
indicates the cohesion between paragraphs i
and i+1. The graph for the first method is
rather flat, with low values, which would a
priori mean that a thematic shift would occur
after each paragraph. But significant words in
this article are not repeated a lot although the
paper is rather thematically homogeneous.
The second method, by the means of the links
between the text words in the collocation
network, is able to find the actual topic
similarity between paragraphs 4 and 5 or 7
and 8.
The improvement resulting from the use of
lexical cohesion also consists in separating
paragraphs that would be set together by the
only word reiteration criterion. It is illustrated
in Figure 2 for a passage of a book by Jules
Verne 1 . A strong link is found by the first
method between paragraphs 3 and 4 although
it is not thematically justified. This situation
occurs when too few words are left by the low
frequency word and tfidf filters.

More generally, the second method, even if it

method by proceeding with more significant
words. Several tests have been made on
newspaper articles that show this tendency.
Experiments with scientific texts have also
been made. These texts use specific reiterated
vocabulary (technical terms). By applying the
first method, significant results are obtained

On the contrary, by applying the second
method to the same text, poor results are
sometimes observed (see Figure 3, the
coherence graph in dash line). This is due to
the absence of highly specific descriptors, used
for Dice coefficient computation, in the lexical
network. It means that descriptors reinforced
or added are not really specific of the text
domain and are nothing but noise in this case.
The two methods have been tested on 16 texts
including 5 scientific articles and 11
expository or narrative texts. They have been
chosen according to their vocabulary
specificity, their size (between 1 to 3 pages)
and their paragraphs size. Globally, the second
method gives better results than the first one: it
modulates some cohesion values. But the
second method cannot always be applied
because problems arise on some scientific
papers due to the lack of important specialized
descriptors in the network. As the network is
built from the recurrence of collocations
between words, such words, even belonging to
the training corpus, would be too scarce to be
retained. So, specialized vocabulary will always
be missing in the network. This observation
has lead us to define the following process to
choose the more suitable method:
Apply method 1;
If x% of the descriptors whose value is not
null after the application of tf.idf are not
found in the network,
then continue with method 1
otherwise apply method 2.
According to our actual studies, x has been
settled to 25.

Without taking into account the collocation
network, the methods described above rely on
the same principles as Hearst (1997) and
Nomoto and Nitta (1994). Although Hearst
considers that paragraph breaks are sometimes
invoked only for lightening the physical
appearance of texts, we have chosen
paragraphs as basic units because they are
more natural thematic units than somewhat
arbitrary sets of words. We assume that
paragraph breaks that indicate topic changes
are always present in texts. Those which are set
for visual reasons are added between them and
the segmentation algorithm is able to join
them again. Of course, the size of actual
paragraphs are sometimes irregular. So their
comparison result is less reliable. But the
collocation network in the second method
tends to solve this problem by homogenizing
the paragraph representation.
As in Kozima (1993), the second method
exploits lexical cohesion to segment texts, but
in a different way. Kozima&apos;s approach relies
on computing the lexical cohesiveness of a
window of words by spreading activation into
a lexical network built from a dictionary. We
think that this complex method is specially
suitable for segmenting small parts of text but
not large texts. First, it is too expensive and
second, it is too precise to clearly show the
major thematic shifts. In fact, Kozima&apos;s
method and ours do not take place at the same
granularity level and so, are complementary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952833333333">
From a first method that considers paragraphs
as basic units and computes a similarity
measure between adjacent paragraphs for
building larger thematic units, we have
developed a second method on the same
principles, making use of a lexical collocation
network to augment the vectorial
representation of the paragraphs. We have
shown that this second method, if well adapted
for processing such texts as newspapers
articles, has less good results on scientific texts,
because the characteristic terms do not emerge
as well as in the first method, due to the
addition of related words. So, in order to build
a text segmentation system independent of the
kind of processed text, we have proposed to
make a shallow analysis of the text
characteristics to apply the suitable method.

So, specialized vocabulary will always be missing in the network. This observation has lead us to define the following process to choose the more suitable method: Apply method 1; If x% of the descriptors whose value is not null after the application of tf.idf are not found in the network, then continue with method 1 otherwise apply method 2. According to our actual studies, x has been settled to 25. 664666 1 — 9. 0. 395 8. Related works Without taking into account the collocation network, the methods described above rely on the same principles as Hearst (1997) and Nomoto and Nitta (1994). Although Hearst considers that paragraph breaks are sometimes invoked only for lightening the physical appearance of texts, we have chosen paragraphs as basic units because they are more natural thematic units than somewhat arbitrary sets of words. We assume that paragraph breaks that indicate topic changes are always present in texts. Those which are set for visual reasons are added between them and the segmentation algorithm is able to join them again. Of course, the size of actual paragraphs are sometimes irregular. So their comparison result is less reliable. </context>

We assume that paragraph breaks that indicate topic changes are always present in texts. Those which are set for visual reasons are added between them and the segmentation algorithm is able to join them again. Of course, the size of actual paragraphs are sometimes irregular. So their comparison result is less reliable. But the collocation network in the second method tends to solve this problem by homogenizing the paragraph representation. As in Kozima (1993), the second method exploits lexical cohesion to segment texts, but in a different way. Kozima&apos;s approach relies on computing the lexical cohesiveness of a window of words by spreading activation into a lexical network built from a dictionary. We think that this complex method is specially suitable for segmenting small parts of text but not large texts. First, it is too expensive and second, it is too precise to clearly show the major thematic shifts. In fact, Kozima&apos;s method and ours do not take place at the same granularity level and so, are complementary. 9. Conclusion From a first method t</context>

Approaches that address this problem can be classified in knowledge-based approaches or word-based approaches. Knowledge-based systems as Grosz and Sidner&apos;s (1986) require an extensive manual knowledge engineering effort to create the knowledge base (semantic network and/or frames) and this is only possible in very limited and well-known domains. To overcome this limitation, and to process a large amount of texts, word-based approaches have been developed. Hearst (1997) and Masson (1995) make use of the word distribution in a text to find a thematic segmentation. These works are well adapted to technical or scientific texts characterized by a specific vocabulary. To process narrative or expository texts such as newspaper articles, Kozima&apos;s (1993) and Morris and Hirst&apos;s (1991) approaches are based on lexical cohesion computed from a lexical network. These methods depend on the presence of the text vocabulary inside their network.

The cohesion between two words is measured as in Church and Hanks (1990) by an estimation of the mutual information based on their collocation frequency. This value is normalized by the maximal mutual information with regard to the corpus, which is given by: !max = log2 N2(Sw —1) with N: corpus size and Sw: window size 5. Thematic segmentation without lexical network The first method, based on a numerical analysis of the vocabulary distribution in the text, is derived from the method described in Masson (1995). A basic discourse unit, here a paragraph, is represented as a term vector =(gil,gi2,...,git) where gi is the number of occurrences of a given descriptor in G. The descriptors are the words extracted by the pre-processing of the current text. Term vectors are weighted. The weighting policy is tf.idf which is an indicator of the importance of a term according to its distribution in a text. It is defined by: wu = . log cif where tfij is the number of occurrences of a descriptor Ti in a paragraph i; dfi is the number of paragraphs in which Tj occurs and 393 N the total number of paragraphs in th</context>
