1 The Importance of
Conversational Grunts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97735819047619">
Conversational grunts, such as uh-huh, un-hn,
mm, and oh are ubiquitous in spoken English.
In our conversation data, these grunts occur
an average of once every 5 seconds in Amer-
ican English conversation. In a sample of 79
conversations from a larger corpus, Switch-
board, um was the 6th most frequent item
(after I, and, the, you, and a), and the four
items uh, uh-huh, um and um-hum accounted
for 4% of the total. These sounds are not only
frequent, they are important in language use.
To mention just one example, people learn-
ing English as a second language are handi-
capped in informal interactions if they cannot
produce and recognize these sounds.

netic label cross-checking, all those who let me record
their conversations, and the anonymous referees; and

Just to be clear about definitions, in this
paper trunts2&apos; means sounds which are &apos;not
words&apos;, where a prototypical &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is a
sound having 1. a clear meaning, 2. the abil-
ity to participate in syntactic constructions,
and 3. a phonotactically normal pronuncia-
tion. For example, uh-huh is a grunt since it
has no referential meaning, has no syntactic
affinities, and has salient breathiness. In this
paper &apos;conversational&apos; refers to sounds which
occur in conversation and are at least in part
directed at the interlocutor, rather than be-
ing purely self-directed3. Both of these defi-
nitions have flaws, but they provide a fairly
objective criterion for delimiting the set of
items which any transcription scheme should
be able to handle.
The phenomena circumscribed by this def-
inition are a subset of &amp;quot;vocal segregates&amp;quot;
(Trager, 1958) and of &amp;quot;interjections&amp;quot;: the dif-
ference is that it limits attention to sounds
occurring in conversations. This definition
also roughly delimits the subset of &amp;quot;discourse
markers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse particles&amp;quot; which occur
in informal spoken discourse.
As the phonetics and meanings of conver-
sational grunts are currently not well under-
stood, we have begun a project aiming to elu-
cidate, model, and eventually exploit them.
The current paper is a report on an approach
2 It may seem that the negative connotations of the
word &apos;grunt&apos; make it inappropriate for use as a tech-
nical term, but the phenomenon itself is often stig-
matized, and so the term is appropriate in that sense
too.
Two rules of thumb were adopted to help in cases
which were difficult to judge: consider laughter as not
conversational, and consider as conversational every-
thing else that might possibly be playing some com-
municative role, even if it isn&apos;t clear what that role
might be.

to the preliminary problem of how to tran-
scribe these sounds.
A generally usable, standardized transcrip-
tion scheme would be of great value. Im-
mediate applications include screenplay writ-
ing and court recording. It would also fa-
cilitate the systematic corpus-based study of
the meanings and functions of these sounds4.
There are also prospects for applications in
systems. One could imagine a dialog tran-
scription system that produces output with
the grunts represented in enough detail to
show whether a listener is being enthusias-
tic, reluctant, non-committal, bored, etc., as
these states are often indicated by grunts
rather than by words. One could imagine
spoken dialog systems which prompt and con-
firm concisely with such grunts, instead of full
words or phrases. And one could imagine spo-
ken dialog systems which adjust their output
based on barge-in feedback from the user such
as uh-huh meaning &amp;quot;go on, don&apos;t talk so slow&amp;quot;,
uh-hum meaning &amp;quot;stop, I need to think&amp;quot;, and
ah meaning &amp;quot;I have something to say&amp;quot;.
Section 2 surveys previous approaches to
grunt transcription, Section 3 proposes a
slightly new scheme, Section 4 discusses its
adequacy, and Section 5 points out some open
issues.

2.1 Phonetically Accurate Schemes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994093083333333">
One tradition in labeling grunts is to use a
completely general scheme. The central inspi-
ration here is the fact that grunts are unlike
words, in that they contain sounds which are
never seen in the lexical items of the language.
As such, they can fall outside the coverage
of even the International Phonetic Alphabet,
which is only designed to handle those sounds
&apos;This is not to say that there can be a strict order-
ing of activities here: on the contrary, it is not pos-
sible to fix a transcription standard without at least
a tacit theory of the meanings and functions of the
items being transcribed. Some thoughts on this ap-
pear elsewhere (Ward, 2000).
which occur contrastively in some words in
some language. Thus there have been pro-
posals for richer, more complete transcription
schemes, capable of handling just about any
communicative noise that people have been
observed to produce, including moans, cries
and belches (Trager, 1958; Poyatos, 1975).
One disadvantage of these notations is that
they are not usable without training.
A second disadvantage is that their gener-
ality is excessive for everyday use. As seen
below, the vast majority of conversational
grunts are drawn from a much smaller inven-
tory of sounds.
A third disadvantage is that they provide
more accuracy than is needed. For exam-
ple, in English there appear to be no grunts
in which the difference between an alveolar
nasal, a velar nasal, or nasalization of a vowel
conveys a difference in meaning, and so these
do not need to be distinguished in transcrip-
tion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9999">
2.2 A Function-based Schemes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999639826086956">
An alternative approach is seen in some
schemes used for labeling corpora for pur-
poses of training and evaluating speech rec-
ognizers. A quote from the most recent
Switchboard labeling standard (Hamaker et
al., 1998) gives the flavor:
20. Hesitation Sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; for hesitations consisting
of a vowel sound, and &amp;quot;urn&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;hm&amp;quot; for hesitations with a nasal
sound, depending upon which tran-
scription the actual sound is closest
to. Use &amp;quot;huh&amp;quot; for aspirated version
of the hesitation as in &amp;quot;huh? &lt;other
speaker responds&gt; urn ok, I see your
point.&amp;quot;
21: yes/no sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh-huh&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;um-hum&amp;quot; (yes) and &amp;quot;huh-uh&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;hum-um&amp;quot; (no) for anything re-
motely resembling these sounds of
assent or denial&amp;quot;
Another scheme (Lander, 1996) lists several
&amp;quot;miscellaneous words&amp;quot;, including:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990182">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890862068966">
&amp;quot;nuh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;mm hmm&amp;quot; (yes),
&amp;quot;hnun mmm&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;nun mm&amp;quot; (no),
&amp;quot;uh huh&amp;quot; (yes), &amp;quot;huh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;uh
uh&amp;quot; (no)
The inspiration behind these schemes
seems to be the idea that grunts are just like
words. This leads to two assumptions, both
of which are questionable. First, there is the
assumption that each grunt has some fixed
meaning and some fixed functional role (filler,
back-channel, etc). However, many specific
grunt sounds can be found in more than one
functional role, as seen in Table 1. Second,
there is the assumption that the set of conver-
sational grunts is small. However the number
of observed grunts is not small, as seen in Ta-
ble 2, and the set of possible grunts is prob-
ably not even finite: for example, it would
not be surprising at all to hear the sound
hum-ha-han in conversation, or hum-ha-an, or
hum-ha-un, and so on, and so on. (However,
not every possible sound seems likely to be a
conversational grunt; for example ziflug would
seem a surprising novelty, and would be down-
right weird in any of the functional positions
typical for grunts.)
One concrete problem with these schemes
is that they are not designed to allow pho-
netically accurate representations of grunts5.
In particular, they make the task of the la-
beler a rather strange one. Given a grunt,
first he must examine the context to deter-
mine whether it is a back-channel or a filler,
then determine whether it sounds affirmative
or negative, and only then can he consider
what the actual sound is, and his options are
limited to picking one of the labels in the func-
tional/semantic category. The relation be-
tween the letters of the label and the phonet-
ics of the grunt becomes somewhat arbitrary.
This would be more tolerable if there was a
clear tendency for each grunt to occur in only
one functional position, but this is not the
case, as noted above. The use of the affirma-
tive/negative distinction as a primary classi-
ficatory feature is also also open to question.
In our corpus, only 1% of the grunts were neg-
ative in meaning, and these were all in con-
texts where a negative answer was expected
or likely, so this distinction is a strange choice
for a top-level dividing principle. Moreover,
negative grunts are, in fact, characterized by
two-syllables with a sharp syllable boundary,
often a glottal stop, and/or a sharp down-
step in pitch, and/or a lack of breathiness,
but these features are reflected only tenuously
in the spellings listed as possible for negative
grunts in these schemes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995973">
2.3 Naive Transcription
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970888888889">
The third tradition in transcribing grunts is to
allow labelers to just spell them in the &apos;usual&apos;
way, as one might see them written in the
comics or in a detective novel. The inspiration
behind this is that native speakers generally
have had a lot of exposure to orthographic
representations of grunts, and can be trusted
to do the right thing.
One problem with this tradition is that the
mapping from letter sequences to the actual
sounds is not clear. For example, a conversa-
tion transcription given as a textbook exam-
ple of good practice includes &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot;,
and &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;oo&amp;quot; (Hutchby and Wooffitt,
1999), without footnoting. Presumably the
means /u/, but it could also possibly
mean a version of &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; with strong lip round-
ing, or a longer form of &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot;, or perhaps a
shorter form (if the labeler was trying to avoid
confusion with the archaic vocative &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;). En-
glish orthography is phonetically ambiguous
and not standardized for grunts.
A second problem with this tradition is that
creaky voice (vocal fry), although pragmati-
cally significant, is generally not represented
(although many practitioners are surprisingly
diligent at noting occurrences of breathiness).

3 Proposal
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992598478873239">
The basic idea is to start with the naive tran-
scription tradition and then tighten it up.
The advantages of using this as a starting
point are two. First, it&apos;s convenient, since
it is ASCII, familiar, and requires no special
training. Second, as the result of the cumu-
lative result of many years of novelists&apos; and
cartoonists&apos; efforts to represent dialog, it has
presumably evolved to be fairly adequate for
capturing those sounds variations which are
significant to meaning.
The biggest need is to clarify and regular-
ize the mapping from transcription to sound.
This is the primary contribution of this paper:
a specification of the actual phonetic values
of each of the letters commonly used in tran-
scribing conversational grunts, as follows:
u means schwa. This causes no confusion be-
cause high vowels, including /u/, are van-
ishingly rare in conversational grunts.
n generally means nagalization. This is un-
familiar in that English, unlike French,
has no nasalized vowels in the words of
the lexicon. However in grunts nasaliza-
tion is common, as in un-hn and nyeah,
and meaning-bearing. Occasionally there
may be nasal consonants, and n can also
be used for such cases, without confusion,
because they appear to bear the same se-
mantic value.
h generally means breathiness. This often oc-
curs at syllable boundaries, as in uh-huh.
Some items involve breathiness through-
out a syllable, others involve a consonan-
tal /h/, while others seem ambiguous be-
tween these two.
A single syllable-final &apos;h&apos; bears no pho-
netic value.
tsk indicates an alveolar tongue click. These
occur often in isolation, and occasionally
grunt-initially6.
- (hyphen) indicates a fairly strong syllable
boundary. Phonetically this means a ma-
jor dip in energy level, a sharp disconti-
nuity in pitch, or a significant region of
breathy or creaky voice.
[repetition] Repetition of a letter indicates
length and/or multiple weakly-separated
syllables.
uu as a syllable is a special case, indicating a
creaky schwa
All other letters have the normal values.
There are two things that standard En-
glish orthography provides no way to express.
These are expressed as annotations, following
the basic transcription and separated from it
by a comma.
cr indicates creaky voice, as in yeah:cr. For
further precision numbers from 1 to 3
can be postposed, as in :crl for slightly
creaky and :cr3 for extremely creaky.
{numbers} numbers after a colon indicate
anchor points for the pitch contour, on
the standard 1 to 5 scale. Thus uh-
uh:44-22 is a negative response or warn-
ing, but uh-huh:43-22 is an blatantly un-
interested back-channel, and uh-huh:32-
34 is the standard, polite back-channel.
Table 3 summarizes these letter-sound
mappings. Table 4 suggests which sounds are
most common.

1. As far as clarity and usability, this
scheme has a direct and simple mapping from
representation to the actual phonetics. It has
been trivial to learn and easy to use (at least
for the author; other labelers have not yet
been trained).
2. As far as representational coverage, this
scheme is adequate for some 97% (=306/317)
of the grunts which occur in our corpus. Thus
it is not truly complete, and labelers must
be allowed to escape into standard lexical
orthography (for things like oop-ep-oop and
wow), into IPA (for cases like achh and yegh,
palatal and velar fricatives, respectively), and
into ad hoc notion (for cases like throat clear-
ings and noisy exhalations).
3. As far as precision, the scheme allows
sufficiently detailed representation; at least to
a first approximation. In particular, it covers
all known meaningful phonetic variations. It
is, however possible that other phonetic dis-
tinctions are also significant. For example,
it may be that the exact height of a vowel

<bodyText confidence="0.999748764705882">
matters, or the exact time point at which a
vowel starts getting creaky, or the presence
of glottal stops, lip rounding, glottalization,
falsetto, and so on matter, or the precise de-
tails of pitch and energy contours matter.
Conversely, the scheme is not over-precise:
all the phonetic elements represented in the
scheme appear to bear meanings (Ward,
2000).
Regarding unambiguity, the scheme is an
improvement but has one failing: repetition
of a letter represents either extended duration
or the presence of multiple syllables. As these
two phonetic features are generally correlated,
and the difference in meaning between them
is anyway subtle, this may not be a major
problem.

This notation assumes that the component
sounds are categorical (except for creakiness
and pitch), but this may in fact not be the
case. Rather it may be that the phonetic
components of grunts have a &amp;quot;gradual, rather
than binary, oppositional character&amp;quot; (Jakob-
son and Waugh, 1979). This is a problem
especially for nasalization and for vowels: it
may be that there is an infinite number of
slightly but significantly different variations.
Further study is required.
Experiments with multiple independent la-
belers are needed to evaluate usability and
measure cross-labeler agreement.
Applying this notation can be complicated
by dialect and individual differences. For ex-
ample, the primary filler for one speaker in
our corpus was aunt. Right now it is not
known whether this is a mere pronunciation
variation, perhaps dialect-related, or signif-
icantly different from urn. More study is
needed.
Other languages also have conversational
grunts, for example, ouais and hien in French,
ja and hm in German, and un, he and ya in
Japanese (Ward, 1998), and it may be pos-
sible to use or adapt the present scheme for
these and other languages.

<abstract confidence="0.994060380434783">grunts, such as uhun-hn, and ubiquitous in spoken English, but no satisfactory scheme for transcribing these items exists. This paper describes previous approaches, presents some facts about the phonetics of grunts, proposes a transcription scheme, and evaluates its accuracy.&apos; 1 The Importance of Conversational Grunts grunts, such as un-hn, ubiquitous in spoken English. In our conversation data, these grunts occur an average of once every 5 seconds in American English conversation. In a sample of 79 conversations from a larger corpus, Switchthe 6th most frequent item and, the, and a), and the four uh, uh-huh, um for 4% of the total. These sounds are not only frequent, they are important in language use. To mention just one example, people learning English as a second language are handicapped in informal interactions if they cannot produce and recognize these sounds. would like to thank Takeki Kamiyama for phonetic label cross-checking, all those who let me record their conversations, and the anonymous referees; and also the Japanese Ministry of Education, the Sound Technology Promotion Foundation, the Nakayama Foundation, the Inam.ori Foundation, the International Communications Foundation and the Okawa Foundation for support. Just to be clear about definitions, in this means sounds which are &apos;not words&apos;, where a prototypical &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is a sound having 1. a clear meaning, 2. the ability to participate in syntactic constructions, and 3. a phonotactically normal pronuncia- For example, is grunt since it has no referential meaning, has no syntactic affinities, and has salient breathiness. In this paper &apos;conversational&apos; refers to sounds which occur in conversation and are at least in part directed at the interlocutor, rather than bepurely Both of these definitions have flaws, but they provide a fairly objective criterion for delimiting the set of items which any transcription scheme should be able to handle. The phenomena circumscribed by this definition are a subset of &amp;quot;vocal segregates&amp;quot; (Trager, 1958) and of &amp;quot;interjections&amp;quot;: the difference is that it limits attention to sounds occurring in conversations. This definition also roughly delimits the subset of &amp;quot;discourse markers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse particles&amp;quot; which occur in informal spoken discourse. As the phonetics and meanings of conversational grunts are currently not well understood, we have begun a project aiming to elucidate, model, and eventually exploit them. The current paper is a report on an approach 2It may seem that the negative connotations of the word &apos;grunt&apos; make it inappropriate for use as a technical term, but the phenomenon itself is often stigmatized, and so the term is appropriate in that sense too. Two rules of thumb were adopted to help in cases which were difficult to judge: consider laughter as not conversational, and consider as conversational everything else that might possibly be playing some communicative role, even if it isn&apos;t clear what that role might be. 29 to the preliminary problem of how to transcribe these sounds. A generally usable, standardized transcription scheme would be of great value. Immediate applications include screenplay writing and court recording. It would also facilitate the systematic corpus-based study of meanings and functions of these There are also prospects for applications in systems. One could imagine a dialog transcription system that produces output with the grunts represented in enough detail to show whether a listener is being enthusiastic, reluctant, non-committal, bored, etc., as these states are often indicated by grunts rather than by words. One could imagine spoken dialog systems which prompt and confirm concisely with such grunts, instead of full words or phrases. And one could imagine spoken dialog systems which adjust their output based on barge-in feedback from the user such &amp;quot;go on, don&apos;t talk so slow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stop, I need to think&amp;quot;, and meaning have something to say&amp;quot;. Section 2 surveys previous approaches to grunt transcription, Section 3 proposes a slightly new scheme, Section 4 discusses its adequacy, and Section 5 points out some open issues. 2 Previous Schemes for Grunt Transcription This section points out the problems with previous approaches to grunt translation. 2.1 Phonetically Accurate Schemes One tradition in labeling grunts is to use a completely general scheme. The central inspiration here is the fact that grunts are unlike words, in that they contain sounds which are never seen in the lexical items of the language. As such, they can fall outside the coverage of even the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is only designed to handle those sounds &apos;This is not to say that there can be a strict ordering of activities here: on the contrary, it is not possible to fix a transcription standard without at least a tacit theory of the meanings and functions of the items being transcribed. Some thoughts on this appear elsewhere (Ward, 2000). which occur contrastively in some words in some language. Thus there have been proposals for richer, more complete transcription schemes, capable of handling just about any communicative noise that people have been observed to produce, including moans, cries and belches (Trager, 1958; Poyatos, 1975). One disadvantage of these notations is that they are not usable without training. A second disadvantage is that their generality is excessive for everyday use. As seen below, the vast majority of conversational grunts are drawn from a much smaller inventory of sounds. A third disadvantage is that they provide more accuracy than is needed. For example, in English there appear to be no grunts in which the difference between an alveolar nasal, a velar nasal, or nasalization of a vowel conveys a difference in meaning, and so these do not need to be distinguished in transcription. 2.2 A Function-based Schemes An alternative approach is seen in some schemes used for labeling corpora for purposes of training and evaluating speech recognizers. A quote from the most recent Switchboard labeling standard (Hamaker et al., 1998) gives the flavor: 20. Hesitation Sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; for hesitations consisting of a vowel sound, and &amp;quot;urn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hm&amp;quot; for hesitations with a nasal sound, depending upon which transcription the actual sound is closest to. Use &amp;quot;huh&amp;quot; for aspirated version of the hesitation as in &amp;quot;huh? &lt;other responds&gt; urn ok, your point.&amp;quot; 21: yes/no sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh-huh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;um-hum&amp;quot; (yes) and &amp;quot;huh-uh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hum-um&amp;quot; (no) for anything remotely resembling these sounds of assent or denial&amp;quot; Another scheme (Lander, 1996) lists several &amp;quot;miscellaneous words&amp;quot;, including: 30 &amp;quot;nuh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;mm hmm&amp;quot; (yes), &amp;quot;hnun mmm&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;nun mm&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;uh huh&amp;quot; (yes), &amp;quot;huh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;uh uh&amp;quot; (no) The inspiration behind these schemes seems to be the idea that grunts are just like words. This leads to two assumptions, both of which are questionable. First, there is the assumption that each grunt has some fixed meaning and some fixed functional role (filler, back-channel, etc). However, many specific grunt sounds can be found in more than one functional role, as seen in Table 1. Second, there is the assumption that the set of conversational grunts is small. However the number of observed grunts is not small, as seen in Table 2, and the set of possible grunts is probably not even finite: for example, it would not be surprising at all to hear the sound conversation, or so on, and so on. (However, not every possible sound seems likely to be a grunt; for example seem a surprising novelty, and would be downright weird in any of the functional positions typical for grunts.) One concrete problem with these schemes is that they are not designed to allow phoaccurate representations of In particular, they make the task of the labeler a rather strange one. Given a grunt, first he must examine the context to determine whether it is a back-channel or a filler, then determine whether it sounds affirmative or negative, and only then can he consider what the actual sound is, and his options are limited to picking one of the labels in the functional/semantic category. The relation between the letters of the label and the phonetics of the grunt becomes somewhat arbitrary. This would be more tolerable if there was a clear tendency for each grunt to occur in only one functional position, but this is not the case, as noted above. The use of the affirmative/negative distinction as a primary classificatory feature is also also open to question. In our corpus, only 1% of the grunts were negative in meaning, and these were all in contexts where a negative answer was expected or likely, so this distinction is a strange choice for a top-level dividing principle. Moreover, negative grunts are, in fact, characterized by two-syllables with a sharp syllable boundary, often a glottal stop, and/or a sharp downstep in pitch, and/or a lack of breathiness, but these features are reflected only tenuously in the spellings listed as possible for negative grunts in these schemes. 2.3 Naive Transcription The third tradition in transcribing grunts is to allow labelers to just spell them in the &apos;usual&apos; way, as one might see them written in the comics or in a detective novel. The inspiration behind this is that native speakers generally have had a lot of exposure to orthographic representations of grunts, and can be trusted to do the right thing. One problem with this tradition is that the mapping from letter sequences to the actual sounds is not clear. For example, a conversation transcription given as a textbook example of good practice includes &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;oo&amp;quot; (Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1999), without footnoting. Presumably the means /u/, but it could also possibly mean a version of &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; with strong lip rounding, or a longer form of &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot;, or perhaps a shorter form (if the labeler was trying to avoid confusion with the archaic vocative &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;). English orthography is phonetically ambiguous and not standardized for grunts. A second problem with this tradition is that creaky voice (vocal fry), although pragmatically significant, is generally not represented (although many practitioners are surprisingly diligent at noting occurrences of breathiness). 2.4 Summary of Desiderata we want a for transcribing grunts which 1. is easy to learn and use, 5This is acceptable if the only aim is to train speech recognizers, where the speech recognizers&apos; acoustic models will end up capturing the possible phonetic variation without human intervention, and if the speech recognition results are not intended for actual use, but merely to be fed into an algorithm for computing recognition scores. 31 total backchannel fluency isolate response ation other filler 1 1 • &apos; final 1 - 2 . . . • 7 12 3 2 &apos; • . • 3 1 1 . • . • &apos; &apos; 4 • 1 • &apos; 1 • • - • • . • 1 • &apos; . • • . • 1 - • • • &apos; - - &apos; - • • - . • - &apos; &apos; • • . • 1 - &apos; • • . - • • - • 2 • * 9 2 1 • . • 5 &apos; 21 . 1 • &apos; 1 - - • 1 • 1 . 14 1 - 2 • . • &apos; • • • . 1 1 1 . - . • • • . 2 8 &apos; &apos; - - 1 1 - • &apos; . . • 10 2 . • 6 2 4 5 1 - . • 1 4 2 3 6 • 1 3 8 . 19 &apos; 19 &apos; 6 [clear-throat] uh. tsk 22 • ah 7 1 aum 3 • hh 2 • hmm 2 • huh 2 • m-hzn 2 2 mm 3 2 MEC= 2 2 myeah 4 2 nn-hn 20 4 oh 2 6 oh-okay 8 L okay 4 2 u-uh 38 uh 2 uh-hu 3 2 -huh 2 3 uh-uh 2 uhh 20 ukay 5 1 um 5 . innm 71 . uu 72 2 UIID1 &apos; yeah (other) 27 34 Total 317 91 108 45 20 13 8 6 26 Table 1: Counts of Grunt Occurrences in various positions and functional roles, for all grunts more times in our corpus [clear-throat] 2 hank 1 nn-nnn 1 n-uh 4 unununu 1 tsk 23 hh 3 nu 1 u-uun 1 nu 5 tsk-naa 1 hh-aaaah 1 numum 1 nam 1 num 5 tsk-neeu 1 hhh 1 nyaa-haao 1 uh 38 uumm 1 tsk-ooh 1 hhh-uuuh 1 nyeah 1 uh-hn 2 uun 1 tsk-yeah 1 hhn 1 o-w 1 uh-hu-uh-hn 1 uuuh 1 [inhale] 1 hmm 2 oa 1 uh-huh 3 uuuuuuu 1 [unsticking] 4 hmmumun 1 oh 20 uh-mm 1 wow 1 aa 1 hn 1 oh-eh 1 uh-uh 2 yah-yeah 1 achh 1 hn-lin 1 oh-kay 1 uh-uhramra 1 ye 1 ah 7 huh 2 oh-okay 2 uhh 2 yeah 71 ahh 1 i 1 oh-yeah 1 uhhh 1 yeah-okay 1 ai 1 iiyeah 1 okay 8 uhhm 1 yeah-yeah I am 1 m-hm 2 okay-hh 1 ukay 2 yeahaah 1 ao 1 mm 2 ooa 1 um 21 yeahh 1 -hm mm 80 0 1 1 ookay 1 um-hm-uh-hra 1 yegh 1 ram-mm aura 5 1 000h 1 mum 4 yeh-yeah 1 mmra ummuna eah 1 3 0000h 1 1 yei 1 ehh 1 myeah 2 oop-ep-oop 1 un-hn 1 yo 1 h-mum 1 nn-hn 3 u-kay 1 nnkay 1 yyeah 1 Table 2: All Grunts in our Corpus, with numbers of occurrences 32 2. can represent all observed grunts, and 3. unambiguously represents all meaningful differences in sound. While it is not possible to devise a single transcription scheme which is perfect for all purposes (Barry and Fourcin, 1992), it is clear that the current schemes all have room for improvement. 3 Proposal The basic idea is to start with the naive transcription tradition and then tighten it up. The advantages of using this as a starting point are two. First, it&apos;s convenient, since it is ASCII, familiar, and requires no special training. Second, as the result of the cumulative result of many years of novelists&apos; and cartoonists&apos; efforts to represent dialog, it has presumably evolved to be fairly adequate for capturing those sounds variations which are significant to meaning. The biggest need is to clarify and regularize the mapping from transcription to sound. This is the primary contribution of this paper: a specification of the actual phonetic values of each of the letters commonly used in transcribing conversational grunts, as follows: schwa. This causes no confusion because high vowels, including /u/, are vanishingly rare in conversational grunts. means nagalization. This is unfamiliar in that English, unlike French, has no nasalized vowels in the words of the lexicon. However in grunts nasalizais common, as in and meaning-bearing. Occasionally there may be nasal consonants, and n can also be used for such cases, without confusion, because they appear to bear the same semantic value. means breathiness. This often ocat syllable boundaries, as in Some items involve breathiness throughout a syllable, others involve a consonantal /h/, while others seem ambiguous between these two. A single syllable-final &apos;h&apos; bears no phonetic value. an alveolar tongue click. These occur often in isolation, and occasionally - (hyphen) indicates a fairly strong syllable boundary. Phonetically this means a major dip in energy level, a sharp discontinuity in pitch, or a significant region of breathy or creaky voice. of a letter indicates length and/or multiple weakly-separated syllables. uu as a syllable is a special case, indicating a creaky schwa All other letters have the normal values. There are two things that standard English orthography provides no way to express. These are expressed as annotations, following the basic transcription and separated from it by a comma. creaky voice, as in further precision numbers from 1 to 3 can be postposed, as in :crl for slightly creaky and :cr3 for extremely creaky. after a colon indicate anchor points for the pitch contour, on standard 1 to 5 scale. Thus uhis negative response or warnbut is blatantly unback-channel, and the standard, polite back-channel. Table 3 summarizes these letter-sound mappings. Table 4 suggests which sounds are most common. 4 Adequacy This scheme does fairly well by the criteria of §2.4. are cases where the click is followed by a voiced sound without any perceptible pause (with a delay from the onset of the click to the onset of voicing of 50 to 170 milliseconds). 33 notation phonetic value h a single syllable-final &apos;11&apos; bears no phonetic value, elsewhere &apos;h&apos; indicates /h/ or breathiness n nasalization, occasionally a nasal consonant (other than /m/) tsk alveolar tongue click u 0 (schwa) repetition of a letter length and/or multiple weakly-separated syllables - (hyphen) a fairly strong boundary between syllables or words standard mappings common in grunts m Iml o /o/ a /a/ y in yeah variants idiosyncratic spellings yeah je kay as in ukay, unkay, mkay etc. uu syllable, indicates a short creaky or glottalized schwa annotations :cr Lcreaky voice (vocal fry) I pitch level Table 3: Regularized English Orthography for Conversational Grunts sound number /m/ 56 nasalization 20 /h/ and breathiness 38 clicks 25 creaky voice 53 /schwa/ 109 /o/ 35 /a/ 5 Table 4: Numbers of grunts in our corpus which include the various sound components 1. As far as clarity and usability, this scheme has a direct and simple mapping from representation to the actual phonetics. It has been trivial to learn and easy to use (at least for the author; other labelers have not yet been trained). 2. As far as representational coverage, this scheme is adequate for some 97% (=306/317) of the grunts which occur in our corpus. Thus it is not truly complete, and labelers must be allowed to escape into standard lexical (for things like IPA (for cases like palatal and velar fricatives, respectively), and into ad hoc notion (for cases like throat clearings and noisy exhalations). 3. As far as precision, the scheme allows sufficiently detailed representation; at least to a first approximation. In particular, it covers all known meaningful phonetic variations. It is, however possible that other phonetic distinctions are also significant. For example, it may be that the exact height of a vowel 34 matters, or the exact time point at which a vowel starts getting creaky, or the presence of glottal stops, lip rounding, glottalization, falsetto, and so on matter, or the precise details of pitch and energy contours matter. Conversely, the scheme is not over-precise: all the phonetic elements represented in the scheme appear to bear meanings (Ward, 2000). Regarding unambiguity, the scheme is an improvement but has one failing: repetition of a letter represents either extended duration or the presence of multiple syllables. As these two phonetic features are generally correlated, and the difference in meaning between them is anyway subtle, this may not be a major problem. 5 Open Issues This notation assumes that the component sounds are categorical (except for creakiness and pitch), but this may in fact not be the case. Rather it may be that the phonetic components of grunts have a &amp;quot;gradual, rather than binary, oppositional character&amp;quot; (Jakobson and Waugh, 1979). This is a problem especially for nasalization and for vowels: it may be that there is an infinite number of slightly but significantly different variations. Further study is required. Experiments with multiple independent labelers are needed to evaluate usability and measure cross-labeler agreement. Applying this notation can be complicated by dialect and individual differences. For example, the primary filler for one speaker in corpus was now it is not known whether this is a mere pronunciation variation, perhaps dialect-related, or signifdifferent from study is needed. Other languages also have conversational for example, French, German, and un, Japanese (Ward, 1998), and it may be possible to use or adapt the present scheme for these and other languages.

For example, the primary filler for one speaker in our corpus was aunt. Right now it is not known whether this is a mere pronunciation variation, perhaps dialect-related, or significantly different from urn. More stu</context>

A quote from the most recent Switchboard labeling standard (Hamaker et al., 1998) gives the flavor: 20. Hesitation Sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; for hesitations consisting of a vowel sound, and &amp;quot;urn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hm&amp;quot; for hesitations with a nasal sound, depending upon which transcription the actual sound is closest to. Use &amp;quot;huh&amp;quot; for aspirated version of the hesitation as in &amp;quot;huh? &lt;other speaker responds&gt; urn ok, I see your point.&amp;quot; 21: yes/no sounds: Use &amp;quot;uh-huh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;um-hum&amp;quot; (yes) and &amp;quot;huh-uh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hum-um&amp;quot; (no) for anything remotely resembling these sounds of assent or denial&amp;quot; Another scheme (Lander, 1996) lists several &amp;quot;miscellaneous words&amp;quot;, including: 30 &amp;quot;nuh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;mm hmm&amp;quot; (yes), &amp;quot;hnun mmm&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;nun mm&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;uh huh&amp;quot; (yes), &amp;quot;huh uh&amp;quot; (no), &amp;quot;uh uh&amp;quot; (no) The inspiration behind these schemes seems to be the idea that grunts are just like words. This leads to two assumptions, both of which are questionable. First, there is the assumption that each grunt has some fixed meaning and some fixed functional role (filler, back-channel, etc). However, many specific grunt sounds can be found in more than one functional role, as seen in Table 1. Second, there is the assumption that the set of conver</context>

For example, uh-huh is a grunt since it has no referential meaning, has no syntactic affinities, and has salient breathiness. In this paper &apos;conversational&apos; refers to sounds which occur in conversation and are at least in part directed at the interlocutor, rather than being purely self-directed3. Both of these definitions have flaws, but they provide a fairly objective criterion for delimiting the set of items which any transcription scheme should be able to handle. The phenomena circumscribed by this definition are a subset of &amp;quot;vocal segregates&amp;quot; (Trager, 1958) and of &amp;quot;interjections&amp;quot;: the difference is that it limits attention to sounds occurring in conversations. This definition also roughly delimits the subset of &amp;quot;discourse markers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;discourse particles&amp;quot; which occur in informal spoken discourse. As the phonetics and meanings of conversational grunts are currently not well understood, we have begun a project aiming to elucidate, model, and eventually exploit them.

In particular, it covers all known meaningful phonetic variations. It is, however possible that other phonetic distinctions are also significant. For example, it may be that the exact height of a vowel 34 matters, or the exact time point at which a vowel starts getting creaky, or the presence of glottal stops, lip rounding, glottalization, falsetto, and so on matter, or the precise details of pitch and energy contours matter. Conversely, the scheme is not over-precise: all the phonetic elements represented in the scheme appear to bear meanings (Ward, 2000). Regarding unambiguity, the scheme is an improvement but has one failing: repetition of a letter represents either extended duration or the presence of multiple syllables. As these two phonetic features are generally correlated, and the difference in meaning between them is anyway subtle, this may not be a major problem. 5 Open Issues This notation assumes that the component sounds are categorical (except for creakiness and pitch), but this may in fact not be the case. Rather it may be that the phonetic components of grunts have a &amp;quot;gradual, rather than binary, oppositional character&amp;quot; (Jakobso</context>
