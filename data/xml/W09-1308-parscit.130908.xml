Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.996283481481481">
Dictionaries of biomedical concepts (e.g. dis-
eases, medical treatments) are critical source
of background knowledge for systems doing
biomedical information retrieval, extraction,
and automated discovery. However, the rapid
pace of biomedical research and the lack of
constraints on usage ensure that such dictio-
naries are incomplete. Focusing on medical
treatment concepts (e.g. drugs, medical pro-
cedures and medical devices), we have devel-
oped an unsupervised, iterative pattern learn-
ing approach for constructing a comprehen-
sive dictionary of medical treatment terms
from randomized clinical trial (RCT) ab-
stracts. We have investigated different meth-
ods of seeding, either with a seed pattern or
seed instances (terms), and have compared
different ranking methods for ranking ex-
tracted context patterns and instances. When
used to identify treatment concepts from 100
randomly chosen, manually annotated RCT
abstracts, our medical treatment dictionary
shows better performance (precision:0.40, re-
call: 0.92 and F-measure: 0.54) over the
most widely used manually created medical
treatment terminology (precision: 0.41, recall:
0.52 and F-measure: 0.42).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999572">
Dictionary based natural language processing sys-
tems have been widely used in recognizing medical
concepts from free text. For example, the MetaMap
program is used to map medical text to concepts
from the most widely used biomedical terminol-
ogy, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
Metathesaurus (Aronson, 2000). It identifies various
forms of UMLS concepts in text and returns them
as a ranked list using a five-step process: identify-
ing simple noun phrases (NP’s), generating variants
of each phrase, finding matched phrases, assign-
ing scores to matched phrases and composing map-
pings. However, its performance largely depends on
the quality of the underlying UMLS Metathesaurus
and its manually created rules and variants. One
study has shown that, of the medical concepts iden-
tified by human subjects, more than 40% were not
in UMLS (Pratt, 2003). Other examples of map-
ping text to controlled biomedical terminologies in-
clude (Cohen, 2005) and (Fang, 2006). Many other
systems make heavy use of biomedical terminolo-
gies directly such as the work of Blaschke, et al.
(Blaschke, 2002) and Friedman et al. (Friedman,
2001).
Biomedical terminology is highly dynamic, both
because biomedical research is itself highly dy-
namic, but also because there are essentially no con-
straints on the use of new terminological variants,
making the terms used in free text quite different
from the canonical forms listed in controlled ter-
minologies. To contrast UMLS with actual text
mentions, there are 150 different chemotherapy con-
cepts in UMLS. The majority of these terms de-
rive from the diseases they are used to treat. For
example cancer chemotherapy, AIDS chemother-
apy, brain disorder chemotherapy, and alcoholism
chemotherapy. On the other hand, we have identi-
fied more than 1,000 different chemotherapy types
mentioned in RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) re-
port abstracts, with most of the names derived

from the chemicals contained in the chemother-
apy regimen, such as platinum-based chemother-
apy or fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. There is
little overlap between the chemotherapy terms in
UMLS and the ones used in RCT abstracts. Even
for simple drug names as 5-fluorouracil and tamox-
ifen, there are many clinically distinct and important
variants of these drugs which are absent in UMLS
as distinct terms/concepts, such as intralesional 5-
fluorouracil, topical 5-fluorouracil, intrahepatic ar-
terial 5-Fluorouracil, adjuvant sequential tamox-
ifen, and neoadjuvant tamoxifen.
There has been considerable work on expand-
ing the coverage of biomedical dictionaries through
morphological variants, but these approaches re-
quire an initial term dictionary with reasonable
extensive coverage. Examples include the ap-
proaches developed by Krauthammer and Nenadic
(Krauthammer, 2004), Tsuruoka and Tsujii (Tsu-
ruoka, 2004) &amp; (Tsuruoka, 2003), Bodenreider, et
al. (Bodenreider, 2002), and Mukherjea and col-
leagues (Mukherjea, 2004). An important short-
coming with static, human derived terminologies
that cannot easily be addressed by looking for vari-
ants of existing terms is the fact that continual devel-
opments in medical therapies constantly gives rise
to new terms. Examples include, Apomab, Bap-
ineuzumab, Bavituximab, Etaracizumab, and Figi-
tumumab. These all represent a new generation of
targeted biological agents currently in clinical trials
none of which appear in UMLS. Clearly we need to
develop techniques to deal with this dynamic termi-
nology landscape.
MEDLINE is the most extensive and authoritative
source of biomedical information. Large quantities
of biomedical text are available in MEDLINE’s col-
lection of RCT reports with over 500,000 abstracts
available. RCT reports are a critical resource for in-
formation about diseases, their treatments, and treat-
ment efficacy. These reports have the advantage of
being highly redundant (a disease or treatment name
is often reported in multiple RCT abstracts), medi-
cally related, coherent in writing style, trustworthy
and freely available.
In our recent study (Xu, 2008), we have devel-
oped and evaluated an automated, unsupervised, it-
erative pattern learning approach for constructing
a comprehensive disease dictionary from RCT ab-
stracts. When used to identify disease concepts from
100 manually annotated clinical abstracts, the dis-
ease dictionary shows significant performance im-
provement (F1 increased by 35-88%) over UMLS
and other disease terminologies. It remained to
be demonstrated that these bootstrapping techniques
are indeed rapidly retargetable and can be extended
to other situations, and so we have extended our
scope to investigate medical treatment names in ad-
dition to disease terms in this work.
Our approach is inspired by the framework
adopted in several bootstrapping systems for learn-
ing term dictionaries, including (Brin, 1998), (?),
and (Agichtein, 2000). These approaches are based
on a set of surface patterns (Hearst , 1992), which
are matched to the text collection and used to find
instance-concept relations. Similar systems include
that of Snow and colleagues (Snow, 2005), which
integrates syntactic dependency structure into pat-
tern representation and has been applied to the task
of learning instance-of relations, and the approach
developed of Caprosaso, et al. (Caprosaso, 2007)
which focussed on learning text context patterns to
identify mentions of point mutations.
All iterative learning systems suffer from the in-
evitable problem of spurious patterns and instances
introduced in the iterative process. To analyze dif-
ferent approaches to addressing this issue, we have
compared three different approaches to ranking ex-
tracted patterns and three different approaches to
ranking extracted instances. Because such systems
also depend on an initial seeding with either a seed
pattern or term instance, an important question is
whether these different starting points lead to dif-
ferent results. We investigated this issue by starting
from each point separately and compared the final
results.

509,308 RCT abstracts published in MEDLINE
from 1965 to 2008 were parsed into 8,252,797 sen-
tences. Each sentence was lexically parsed to gen-

Pattern Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996276">
Figure 1 describes the bootstrapping algorithm used
in learning instances of treatment and their associ-
ated text patterns. The algorithm can operate in two
modes, either starting with a seed pattern p0, which
represents a typical way of writing about treatments,
or a set of seed instances, (di). For example, the
seed pattern we used was “treated with NP” (NP:
noun phrase). The program loops over a procedure
consisting of two steps: instance extraction and pat-
tern discovery. In the instance extraction step, pat-
terns are used as search queries to the local search
engine. The parse trees with given patterns are re-
trieved and noun phrases (instances of treatments)
following the pattern are matched from the parse
trees. In the pattern discovery step, instances ex-
tracted from the previous iteration are used as search
queries to the local search engine. Corresponding
sentences containing instance mentions are retrieved
and the bigrams (two words) in front of instances are
extracted as patterns. When seeding with an initial
pattern, only two iterations are typically needed, as
experience shows that most of reliable patterns and
instances have been discovered at this stage. The al-
gorithm stops after a single iteration when seeding
with a list of instances.

peared in MEDLINE RCT reports. We randomly
selected 500 drug terms and 500 medical procedure
terms from the 22,000 terms as seed instances and
used them in the pattern discovery system described

instance(d) that is obtained multiple times
is more likely to be a real treatment concept

single mention in the whole corpus. We define
scoreA(d) as the number of times where d
appears in the corpus.
2. Pattern Based rank: A treatment instance ob-
tained from multiple patterns is more likely
to be a real treatment concept when compared
with the one that was obtained by a single pat-
tern (p). Pattern Based rank takes into account
the number of patterns that generated the in-
stance, score of those patterns, and the num-
ber of times that the instance is associated with
each pattern (count(p, d)).

pared with the one that was obtained from a

ranked by the best pattern (pb) that generated
the instances and then further ties are broken
by the number of times the instance is associ-
ated with that pattern (count(p, d)) to provide

3.1 Evaluation of Stanford Parser in
Identifying Treatment Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>

Even though the Stanford Parser is trained on non-
medical data, it is highly accurate in identifying
treatments as noun phrases or parts of a noun phrase
with accuracy of 0.95. The reason may be that medi-
cal treatments are indeed often noun phrases or parts
of a noun phrase in RCT reports, and there are strong
syntactical signals for their phrasal roles in the sen-
tences. For example, treatments are often either the
object of a preposition (e.g. efficacy offluorouracil
and treated with fluorouracil) or the subject of a sen-
tence (e.g. fluorouracil is effective in treating colon
cancer).

patterns are relevant (see Evaluation of The Ex-

the intersection of the top ranked patterns between
both seeding methods at different rank cut-offs. We
find a very high level of intersection between the top
ranked patterns from both initial seed types, for ex-

78,037 patterns, each with an accompanying confi-
dence score. The top 20 patterns are associated with
more than 90% of the instances. We evaluated the
quality of the dictionary by using it to identify treat-
ment concepts in 100 randomly selected abstracts
where treatment names were manually annotated.
There were an average of three treatment names per
test abstract. Table 4 shows the precision, recall and
F1 values when instances are ranked by the best pat-
tern based ranking method (ScoreC). The precision,
recall and F1 values at each cut-off (percentage of all
instances) were averaged across the 100 abstracts.
The precision, recall and F1 of the UMLS
Metathesaurus in identifying treatment names from
the test dataset are 0.41, 0.52 and 0.42 respectively.
The performance using UMLS on this task is con-
sistent with a previous study (Pratt, 2003). The low
precision may due to the fact that UMLS often tags
irrelevant names as treatment related names. For ex-
ample, common, non-specific terms such as drug,
agent, treatment and procedure appear in the dictio-
nary derived from UMLS. However, we chose not to
edit the lexicon derived from UMLS as it is unclear
how to do so in a systematic matter without essen-
tially creating a new version of UMLS, and we are
interested in studying methods that do not rely on
any human involvement (our Discussion describes
the possible inclusion of human judgments). Also,
the low recall of UMLS is not surprising given the
fact that the names specified in UMLS are often not
the terms authors use in writing. The performance
of our dictionary (precision: 0.40, recall: 0.92, F1:
0.54) is a dramatic improvement over using UMLS.
Our recall is high since all the terms are learned from
the literature directly and exemplify the manner in
which authors write RCT reports. However, the pre-
cision of our dictionary is still low (see Discussion).

We have demonstrated an automated, unsupervised,
iterative pattern learning approach for bootstrapping
construction of a comprehensive treatment lexicon.
We also compared different pattern and instance
ranking methods and different initial seed types (in-
stances or patterns). On the task of term identifica-
tion, use of our boostrapped lexicon increased per-
formance over using the most widely used manually
curated terminology (UMLS). We have extended our
previous work to the identification of new termi-
nology types, demonstrating the versatility of this
approach. Our approach may also be used with
other data sources such as general health related web
pages. However, there is still significant space in
which to seek improvement in increasing the cover-
age of our lexicon and the quality of our patterns.
Although useful in demonstrating the proof of
concept and allowing us to examine different rank-
ing methods, focusing on bigrams that precede
noun-phrases limited the space of patterns that we
could potentially examine. More complex patterns
might be involved. For example, in the sentence
“Pravastatin is an effective and safe drug” (PMID
08339527), there is a distinctive treatment related
pattern “NP is an effective and safe drug” that our
technique does not capture. However, most key
terms are mentioned in multiple contexts. For ex-
ample, Pravastatin appears with the seed pattern
treatment with more than 200 times. As our corpus
of literature increases, redundancy will increase the
likelihood of a treatment term being matched by the
type of patterns we recognize. The rapid growth of
biomedical knowledge and literature, which makes
our automatically generated medical treatment vo-
cabulary necessary, can also act to increase its cov-
erage over time.
In order to keep our algorithm simple, we did not
perform deep grammatical analysis. For example, in
the sentence “Treatment of the subjects with atorvas-
tatin decreased the abundance of IL-12p35 mRNA in
mononuclear cells” (PMID 12492458), atorvastatin
is associated with treatment of, not subjects with.
Since our algorithms simply extracts the two words
in front of treatment names, subjects with will be ex-
tracted as treatment related pattern. In fact, subjects
with is a disease related pattern in RCT reports, for

example “34 subjects with asthma”. But our pattern
ranking algorithm will assign a low score to subjects
with since the terms associated with this pattern are
more disease related and have little overlap with the
output of the seed pattern treatment with.
Our instance ranking assigns high confidence
scores to common and non specific terms like this
drug, the treatment or this procedure since they are
often associated with highly ranked patterns many
times. These anaphoric terms often refer to treat-
ment names previously specified. There are at least
two ways to address this problem. The first is to as-
sign low scores to terms starting with a determiner
such as the or this. Another way to improve the in-
stance ranking algorithm is to take into account of
the overall context of the term. For example, these
anaphora often appear in specific sections of RCT
reports such as the result section, and refer to terms
from previous sections. Specific examples include
“Treatment with this drug should be attempted in
intractable cases” (PMID 09038009) and “The effi-
cacy of the treatment was 88 and 95% in group 1 and
2, respectively” (PMID 14520944). The terms from
title, background or conclusion sections could be as-
signed higher scores than the ones from result sec-
tion. Beyond these simple heuristics, more sophisti-
cated approaches might take advantage of the work
in anaphora resolution, such as (Baldwin, 2001).
The lexicon consists of terms with mixed hi-
erarchies, including general terms as chemother-
apy, surgery, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and spe-
cific terms as fluorouracil, oral or intravenous 5-
Fluorouracil, cisplatin, nephrectomy. In order to
make this dictionary more useful, additional work
is needed to organize the terms and build ontologies
based on the lexicon.
Previous work has shown that learning multiple
semantic types simultaneously can improve preci-
sion (Thelen, 2002) &amp; (Curran, 2007), and it re-
mains to be seen if that approach can be combined
with the prioritization of pattern and extracted in-
stance rankings here to give better overall perfor-
mance. Other possible extensions and improve-
ments include various approaches to slow the learn-
ing process and discover new patterns and instances
more conservatively, at the expense of more itera-
tions. Further improvements can be expected from
integrating active learning approaches to include
the involvement of a human judge in the process,
analogous to the tag-a-little, learn-a-little method
proposed as part of the Alembic Workbench (Day,
1997). Because our approach ranks both extracted
patterns and instances, it is amenable to such tech-
niques. Indeed, active learning has been found
to provide considerable gains in corpus annotation
(Tomanek, 2007) &amp; (Buyko, 2007), and can be a
model for semi-automated terminology compilation.

<abstract confidence="0.963161571428571">Dictionaries of biomedical concepts (e.g. diseases, medical treatments) are critical source of background knowledge for systems doing biomedical information retrieval, extraction, and automated discovery. However, the rapid pace of biomedical research and the lack of constraints on usage ensure that such dictionaries are incomplete. Focusing on medical treatment concepts (e.g. drugs, medical procedures and medical devices), we have developed an unsupervised, iterative pattern learning approach for constructing a comprehensive dictionary of medical treatment terms from randomized clinical trial (RCT) abstracts. We have investigated different methods of seeding, either with a seed pattern or seed instances (terms), and have compared different ranking methods for ranking extracted context patterns and instances. When used to identify treatment concepts from 100 randomly chosen, manually annotated RCT abstracts, our medical treatment dictionary shows better performance (precision:0.40, recall: 0.92 and F-measure: 0.54) over the most widely used manually created medical treatment terminology (precision: 0.41, recall: 0.52 and F-measure: 0.42).</abstract>

It remained to be demonstrated that these bootstrapping techniques are indeed rapidly retargetable and can be extended to other situations, and so we have extended our scope to investigate medical treatment names in addition to disease terms in this work. Our approach is inspired by the framework adopted in several bootstrapping systems for learning term dictionaries, including (Brin, 1998), (?), and (Agichtein, 2000). These approaches are based on a set of surface patterns (Hearst , 1992), which are matched to the text collection and used to find instance-concept relations. Similar systems include that of Snow and colleagues (Snow, 2005), which integrates syntactic dependency structure into pattern representation and has been applied to the task of learning instance-of relations, and the approach developed of Caprosaso, et al. (Caprosaso, 2007) which focussed on learning text context patterns to identify mentions of point mutations. All iterative learning systems suffer from th</context>

However, its performance largely depends on the quality of the underlying UMLS Metathesaurus and its manually created rules and variants. One study has shown that, of the medical concepts identified by human subjects, more than 40% were not in UMLS (Pratt, 2003). Other examples of mapping text to controlled biomedical terminologies include (Cohen, 2005) and (Fang, 2006). Many other systems make heavy use of biomedical terminologies directly such as the work of Blaschke, et al. (Blaschke, 2002) and Friedman et al. (Friedman, 2001). Biomedical terminology is highly dynamic, both because biomedical research is itself highly dynamic, but also because there are essentially no constraints on the use of new terminological variants, making the terms used in free text quite different from the canonical forms listed in controlled terminologies. To contrast UMLS with actual text mentions, there are 150 different chemotherapy concepts in UMLS. The major</context>
