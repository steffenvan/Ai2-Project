This work describes first steps towards
building a system that synchronously gen-
erates multimodal (textual and visual)
route directions for pedestrians. We pur-
sue a corpus-based approach for building a
generation model that produces natural in-
structions in multiple languages. We con-
ducted an empirical study to collect ver-
bal route directions, and annotated the ac-
quired texts on different levels. Here we
describe the experimental setting and an
analysis of the collected data.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999903041666667">
Route directions guide a person unfamiliar with
the environment to their designated goal. We plan
to generate route instructions that are similar to
those given by humans by referring to landmarks
and by structuring the route in a way that it is easy
to memorize (Denis, 1997).
We develop a system for synchronously gen-
erating natural language route directions and 3D
scenes of a route. The core of the architecture
is a unified representation providing information
for both verbal and graphical output. The direct
correspondence between linguistic references and
shown objects facilitates the identification of the
visual scene in the real world and the choice of the
correct action while following the route. To cre-
ate a reusable system that is adaptable to different
navigational domains and languages, we use ma-
chine learning techniques to build a statistical gen-
eration model from annotated corpora. We report
on an empirical study to collect human-produced
walking directions to be used for statistical gener-
ation from underlying semantic structures. While
our scenario is ultimately multilingual, here we
give an analysis of the German dataset.

The task of analyzing and generating cognitively
adequate route instructions has been addressed by
a number of authors (Taylor &amp; Tversky, 1996;
Tappe, 2000; Habel, 2003; Richter, 2008; Vi-
ethen &amp; Dale, 2008; Kelleher &amp; Costello, 2009).
Marciniak &amp; Strube (2005) showed that a system
for generating route directions can be successfully
trained on a small set of 75 route direction texts
(8418 tokens). In their approach directions are
represented in a graph, which encodes informa-
tion on various conceptual levels. While their ap-
proach is restricted to reproducing directions for
the learned graphs, we will generate directions for
a wide range of possible routes. Dale et al. (2005)
developed a system that takes GIS data as input
and uses a pipeline architecture to generate verbal
route directions. In contrast to their approach, our
approach will be based on an integrated architec-
ture allowing for more interaction between the dif-
ferent stages of generation. The idea of combining
verbal directions with scenes from a virtual 3D en-
vironment has recently lead to a new framework
for evaluating NLG systems: The Challenge on
Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments
(GIVE) (Byron et al., 2009) is planned to become
a regular event for the NLG community.

For collecting naturally produced route instruc-
tions, we conducted a study with 29 native speak-
ers of German (66% female and 33% male). The
participants in our study were students from var-
ious fields aged between 20 and 34 years. We
designed two different settings: one on-site set-
ting, in which participants walked around in a real
world situation (specifically our university cam-
pus), and one desk-based setting, in which they
interacted with a web application. The former
was further divided into indoor and outdoor routes,

while the latter was restricted to an outdoor sce-
nario. This design enables us to study possible
differences and commonalities between linguistic
realizations obtained for different environments as
well as different presentation modes.
For both scenarios, the task was to give written
directions to a person unfamiliar with the area as
to how to get to the destination the participants just
reached, taking the same route. First, participants
were led along a route to a given destination point
(on-site). Each participant was asked to give di-
rections for two routes inside buildings of the uni-
versity campus (e.g. from an office to a seminar
room, cf. Figure 1), and one outside route (e.g.
from the building entrance to a bus stop).
Second, participants were shown a web appli-
cation that guided them along a route by means of
a 2D animation (desk-based). Subjects were al-
lowed to use all information displayed by the web
application: named places, buildings, street and
bridge names, etc. (cf. Figure 2).

manually corrected spelling mistakes, omissions
resulting in grammatical errors, and removed el-

The preprocessed texts were annotated on the
following three levels:
pos lemma – part-of-speech and lemma
syn dep – dependency relations
sem frame – frames and semantic roles
For the pos lemma and syn dep levels, we used
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1997) and XLE (Maxwell
&amp; Kaplan, 1993). The corpus was parsed
with the German ParGram LFG grammar (Forst,
2007). The outputs were corrected manually
by two annotators. On the sem frame level an-
notation was carried out using the annotation
tool SALTO (Burchardt et al., 2006) and fol-

and LOCATIVE RELATION (Baker et al., 1998). In
terms of accuracy for unlabeled/labeled relations,
the annotation agreement was 78.88%/65.17% on
the syn dep level and 79.27%/68.39% for frames
and semantic roles.

scenario-specific. In many cases, the occurrence
or absence of a verb can be attributed to a verb’s
selectional restrictions. For example, some of
the verbs describing movements along streets (e.g.
folgen ‘to follow’, abbiegen ‘to turn into’) do not
occur within the indoor corpus whereas verbs de-
scribing “3D movements” (e.g. durchqueren ‘to
walk through’, hinuntergehen ‘to walk down’) are
not mentioned with the Google Maps setting.
The most frequent nouns significantly differ be-
tween the indoor and outdoor settings. This corre-
lation does not come as a surprise, as most of the
mentioned objects cannot be found in all scenar-
ios. On the other hand, nouns that are common
to both indoor and outdoor scenarios can be di-
vided into two categories: Nouns denoting (1) ob-
jects that appear in both scenarios (e.g. Geb¨aude
‘building’) and (2) abstract concepts typical for
route directions in general, e.g. Richtung ‘direc-
tion’, Nummer ‘number’, Ziel ‘goal’, and Start-
punkt ‘starting point’.

5.2 Landmark Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996264615384615">
Landmark alignment serves the purpose of de-
tecting objects that are most frequently men-
tioned across directions, and how the same ob-
ject is referred to differently. We created a graph-
based representation of the landmarks mentioned
in each route instruction (single route representa-
tion, SRR) for use in two types of alignment. Fig-
ure 3 shows an example from the indoor study.
First, we created a combined graph for each phys-
ical route by merging the respective SRRs, taking
into account several criteria:
String matching of landmark names;
Semantic similarity using GermaNet (Lemnitzer
&amp; Kunze, 2002), a lexical-semantic network
for German similar to WordNet;
Frequency of references across all directions;
Spatio-temporal proximity of references to the
same object;
Number of landmarks mentioned in a single di-
rection (i.e. length of the SRR).
The combined graphs show that there are strong
correspondences between the directions for the
same route. We also found that, in the campus
settings, there was a small number of frequently
used general objects and a large number of less
frequently used specific objects. This facilitates
merging and shows the importance of the objects
for people’s orientation, and at the same time sup-
ports our claim that other modalities are needed
to disambiguate references during navigation. For
generating informative referential expressions, the
combined graph needs to be refined so that object
properties are represented (Krahmer et al., 2003).
Second, we aligned the SRRs with the physical
route graph. Comparing the landmarks mentioned
in the campus settings revealed that, in 97.8% of
the cases, people adhere to the sequence in which
objects are encountered. Reversed order was only
found in special cases like distant objects.

5.3 Discourse Phenomena

<bodyText confidence="0.9999620625">
We analyzed the use of anaphora, the temporal or-
der of instructions, and occurrences of prototypi-
cal event chains in the collected texts in order to
identify coherence-inducing elements.
Spatio-temporal adverbials: Most anaphors
mention intermediate goals on the route in order
to refer to the starting point of a new action (e.g.
da/hier ‘here’, dort ‘there’). This finding goes
hand in hand with the observation that the col-
lected route directions are typically structured in
a linear temporal order (cf. Table 3) as for ex-
ample indicated by the use of adverbs indicat-
ing temporal succession (e.g. jetzt ‘now’, dann
‘then’ and danach ‘afterwards’) and conjunctions
(e.g. bis ‘until’, wenn ‘when’). Interestingly, a re-
versed order can be found in a few cases, where

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999803674418605">
The lexical corpus analysis confirms our hypoth-
esis that there are strong commonalities in lexi-
cal choice for directions that persist across sce-
narios and presentation modes, with a small num-
ber of focused differences, and obvious domain-
dependent lexical differences regarding the nature
of objects in the respective scenarios. While our
current corpus data is rather broad, environment-
specific data can be extended quickly by setting up
web studies using 2D and 3D environments.
The alignment of the physical routes and ver-
bal instructions shows a clear tendency that linear
route structure is observed in verbal realization,
with only few exceptions. Since temporal order
is observed by default, temporal annotation can be
restricted to capture exceptional orderings, which
are recoverable from linguistic cues. The study of
discourse coherence effects yielded a number of
elements that will be given special attention in the
surface generation model. We observed a variety
of coherence-inducing elements that are generic
in nature and thus seem well-suited for a corpus-
based generation model. As other languages are
known to exhibit differences in verbal realization
of directions (von Stutterheim et al., 2002), we
have to extend our data collection in order to gen-
erate systematic linguistic variations from a single
underlying semantic structure for all languages.
The linguistic annotation levels of frames and
roles, syntactic dependencies, and basic word cat-
egories have been tested successfully with a sim-
ilar corpus (Roth &amp; Frank, 2009). The next steps
will consist in the alignment of physical routes and
landmarks with semantic representations in an in-
tegrated generation architecture.

We conducted an empirical study to collect verbal route directions, and annotated the acquired texts on different levels. Here we describe the experimental setting and an analysis of the collected data. 1 Introduction Route directions guide a person unfamiliar with the environment to their designated goal. We plan to generate route instructions that are similar to those given by humans by referring to landmarks and by structuring the route in a way that it is easy to memorize (Denis, 1997). We develop a system for synchronously generating natural language route directions and 3D scenes of a route. The core of the architecture is a unified representation providing information for both verbal and graphical output. The direct correspondence between linguistic references and shown objects facilitates the identification of the visual scene in the real world and the choice of the correct action while following the route. To create a reusable system that is adaptable to different navigational domains and languages, we use machine learning techniques to build a statistical generation m</context>

We created a graphbased representation of the landmarks mentioned in each route instruction (single route representation, SRR) for use in two types of alignment. Figure 3 shows an example from the indoor study. First, we created a combined graph for each physical route by merging the respective SRRs, taking into account several criteria: String matching of landmark names; Semantic similarity using GermaNet (Lemnitzer &amp; Kunze, 2002), a lexical-semantic network for German similar to WordNet; Frequency of references across all directions; Spatio-temporal proximity of references to the same object; Number of landmarks mentioned in a single direction (i.e. length of the SRR). The combined graphs show that there are strong correspondences between the directions for the same route. We also found that, in the campus settings, there was a small number of frequently used general objects and a large number of less frequently used specific objects. This facilitates merging and shows the importance of the objects for people’s orient</context>

We report on an empirical study to collect human-produced walking directions to be used for statistical generation from underlying semantic structures. While our scenario is ultimately multilingual, here we give an analysis of the German dataset. 2 Related Work The task of analyzing and generating cognitively adequate route instructions has been addressed by a number of authors (Taylor &amp; Tversky, 1996; Tappe, 2000; Habel, 2003; Richter, 2008; Viethen &amp; Dale, 2008; Kelleher &amp; Costello, 2009). Marciniak &amp; Strube (2005) showed that a system for generating route directions can be successfully trained on a small set of 75 route direction texts (8418 tokens). In their approach directions are represented in a graph, which encodes information on various conceptual levels. While their approach is restricted to reproducing directions for the learned graphs, we will generate directions for a wide range of possible routes. Dale et al. (2005) developed a system that takes GIS data as input and uses a pipeline architecture to generate verbal route directions. In co</context>
