In Chinese language processing, the
recognition and analysis for serial verb
constructions (SVCs) is a fascinating research
topic. Chinese language researchers each may
have a different definition and interpretation of
SVC since the structure of SVC makes Chinese
unique to other languages and contains complex
semantic and pragmatic information. This paper
proposes a formal definition of SVC and a
knowledge based approach for the recognition of
SVCs, which is adopted in TOTAL-CK, a
transfer-based MT system from Chinese to
Korean. The recognition process is carried out in
two stages: the analysis stage classifies SVCs
into general categories, and the transfer stage
performs further classification for Korean
transfer. Some evaluation result for each stage
was also given with statistics of each category of
SVCs

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999817666666667">
Many Chinese language researchers have paid
special attention to the so-called ‘serial verb
constructions (SVCs)’, where two or more
semantically or pragmatically related verb
phrases or clauses are juxtaposed together
without any functional marker. Because of
different definitions and interpretations of SVCs
among researchers, their categorizations differ
according to researchers’ viewpoints.

In a Chinese to Korean machine translation,
the hidden relation of the serial verbs should be
expressed with some function words from the
target language viewpoint. Moreover, the
conceptual scope of these function words is
different from the scope of SVC categorizations
that are classified based on the viewpoint of the
Chinese language itself.
In this paper, we proposes a different
categorization of SVCs defined by the
contrastive analysis of the two languages, and
also an SVC identification method that is
adopted in a Chinese-to-Korean MT system,
TOTAL-CK. The TOTAL (Translator Of Three
Asian Languages: Chinese, Korean and
Japanese) project has been conducted under a
hybrid strategy with transfer-based and
example-based engines.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838181818182">
In this section, some contrastive analyses of
the two languages are introduced for better
understanding of an SVC sentence. Since
Chinese is an isolating language, morphological
or syntactic markers rarely appear in a sentence,
while in an agglutinative language such as
Korean, these functional markers are not an
optional unit but an obligatory unit in a sentence.
An example is given in (1). Notice that the
Korean alphabets are written with Yale
Romanization in this paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.9728471">
He opens the door and enters (the room).
In the Korean sentence, ko is a connective
particle, and also nun, ul, and nta denote a topic
auxiliary particle, an object case particle and
declarative terminative ending, respectively. All
these functional markers should be decided in
the Korean transfer stage. Specifically, we
require a process to select one from the possible
conjugational markers when a Chinese SVC
sentence is transferred to its Korean counterpart.

A SVC is studied among several researchers
as different names. But the general syntactic
form is (NP) V1 (NP) V2 (NP)1. The variance of
definition for SVC comes from the different
scope of interpretation for the sentence pattern.
We will introduce three typical researches to
clearly outline our definition of SVC. The
narrowest view of scope is suggested in (Lü,
1953). In his interpretation, V1 and V2 have the
same subject and should be not coordinative, but
it is difficult to decide which one is main or
additional. Zhu (Zhu, 1981) includes all cases
of Lü’s and the possibility of adding an adjective
to substitute for the second verb position. He
also includes the case where an additional verb
and a main verb are used, such as V+ 4
expression in V1 position, which indicates that
V1 is additional and V2 is main. The broadest
scope is proposed in (Li &amp; Thompson, 1981).
According to his interpretation, an SVC includes
not only all the patterns noted above but also a
pivot construction, a subject/object clause, and a
coordinate clause, but excludes the pattern with
an adjective in the V2 position. In this paper, the
scope of SVC is almost same as Li’s but the
classification of SVCs differs slightly, detailing
the categorization in chapter 4.
A few computational solutions to identifying
SVCs have been proposed by some researchers.
A formal description is shown in (Chan, 1998)
using time lapse notation and the related
definition. However, her method makes it
difficult to computationally detect SVCs without
the resources containing the deep level of

<bodyText confidence="0.999983625">
In the previous chapter, we mentioned the
syntactic format of SVCs which is NP V1 (NP)
V2 (NP) and the different scope of definition of
SVCs by the Chinese language researches. To
outline the scope of SVCs, we define SVCs in
terms of dependency relation such that V1 is the
head of V2, or V2 is the head of V1. It is
formally defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.475077">
Definition 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998134">
Let N represent a set of nodes in a dependency
tree, and W a set of words. Further Let V be a
set of verbs, and P be a set of all parts of speech
in Chinese. Then the functions: head, nw, and
npos, are defined as below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.984520333333333">
head(n) =hn where nEN and hn is the head of n
nw(n) = w where n EN and w E W
npos(n) = np where n EN and np EP

<bodyText confidence="0.962337">
A definition of SVC is:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.40073175">
Given a node n such that npos(n) E V and
Head(n) = hn,
If and only if npos(hn) E V and hn is the head of
a given sentence then the sentence is a SVC.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.990715714285714">
The three sentences from the top of table 1
satisfy the given condition. Also the head of
the node is the sentence head, thus these must
be SVCs. For the last sentence, nw(n) is 接
入, and nw(Head(n)) is 总数 whose the POS
is not verb and also whose the node is not the
sentence head. Thus it is not an SVC.

The corresponding Chinese dependency
relations to object, subject and pivot
constructions also appear in the some research in
Chinese language processing (Zhou &amp; Huang,
1994) but the other two are not shown due to
their different viewpoints.
The descriptive construction is directly able to
be one-to-one mapped to the Korean counterpart.
However the separate event SVCs should be
further classified for Korean transfer since the
separate event SVC is possibly mapped into
sentences with several different Korean
conjunctional particles. Thus, it is touched in
the transfer stage.

The simultaneous separate events is easily
recognized by the lexical (着) attached to the first
verb. Also, we use a simple heuristic to detect
the circumstantial separate events with the
lexical pattern information.
The resource used in this stage is a Chinese
thesaurus called Tongyi-ci-cilin (Mei, 1983).
With the thesaurus the remainders of separate
event SVCs are processed with great care. If V2
is related to the interrupt concept then the
transitional separate events are assigned. The
most difficult and frequently occurring cases are
the restrictive separate events and
quasi-coordinative separate event.
The key idea of using the thesaurus is based
on the observation that the verb V2, if restricted
by V1 makes it possible that the concept of V2
will also be restricted by the concept of V1. To
complete the solution, we first define the
relations: RSTV, RSTL and RSTM as follows:
Definition 2
We define the relations: RSTV, RSTL, and
RSTM, as follows:
RSTV= {(V1,V2) where V1 and V2 are the
first verb and second verb in a given SVC
sentence and V2 is semantically restricted by
V1 : (V1,V2) ≠ (V2,V1)}
RSTL= {(CL1,CL2) where CL1 and CL2 are
the low level concept of the first verb and the
low level concept 3 of second verb in the
Chinese thesaurus, respectively, and CL2 is
semantically restricted by CL1 : (CL1,CL2) ≠
(CL2,CL1)}
RSTM= {(CM1, CM2) where CM1 and CM2
are the middle level concept of the first verb and
the middle level concept of second verb in the
Chinese thesaurus, respectively, and ML2 is
semantically restricted by ML1 : (ML1,ML2) ≠
(ML2, ML1)}
The relations RSTV, RSTL, and RSTM are
not symmetric and not reflexive. Based on the
definition we derive the following heuristics:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.7124705">
if (V1,V2)∈ RSRV then (CL1,CL2) ∈ RSTL

concept, the next narrow term called middle-level concept
and the narrowest term called low-level concept,
respectively.
(CM1,CM2) ∈ RSTM.
All three examples from the top of table 5
satisfy the condition that, if (V1, V2) RSTV
∈
then (CL1,CL2) ∈RSTL and (CM1,CM2) ∈
RSTM. If the condition is always true, then we
use the middle-level concept relation for
detecting a restrictive separate event in order to
increase the applicability of our rules. Also, the
data structure of RSTM is easily represented
with an adjacent matrix with the size of 21*21 4
(Sahni, 1998) where the matrix M is a square
matrix, whose column and row are the
middle-level concept, and if M(i,j) = 1 then
concept j is semantically restricted by concept i,
otherwise (i,j) ∉RSTM.

However, the last example reveals that the
condition is not always true since we have the
result, both (Hi,Hj) and (Hj,Hi) ∈ RSTM.
Thus, it violates the definition of RSTM. Hence,
we may not directly use the middle-level concept
adjacent matrix and the size of the low-level
concept matrix is too large to be used.5
We come up with a solution of a frame with
multi level concepts. The frame consists of three
parts: the middle-level concept adjacent matrix,
the low-level concept adjacent lists and the
collocation serial verb list for detecting a serial
verb that always appears together.
Our solution is that the exceptional cases are
covered by either the collocation verb lists or the
low-level concept adjacent list. The remaining
frequently occurring cases are captured by the
middle-level adjacent matrix. This leads to the
sparse matrix of the low-level concept which

causes the adaptation of adjacent lists rather than
an adjacent matrix for the low-level concepts.
The order of searching the frame is the
collocation list, the low-level concept list and the
middle-level concept matrix. In the collocation
list, if V1 and V2 belongs to the collocation list
of the restrictive separate events, such as V*O
� or the one of quasi-coordinative, such as 1
t441 then the sentence is assigned to a restrictive
case or a quasi-coordinative case, respectively.
In the low-level concept lists and the
middle-level concept matrix, if matching
succeeds, which means that V2 is semantically
restricted by V1, then a restrictive case is
assigned; otherwise, a quasi-coordinate case is
detected6. The detailed process for identifying
the subcategories of separate events is shown in
figure 4.

The precision of identifying the category of
separate event is 95.3%. The errors resulted from
a circumstantial case since our heuristics is too
restrictive to detect all cases, thus, it might be
revised further, and since the low-level concept
lists are not completed. The low-level concept
lists will be continuously updated for increasing
coverage in the tuning stage of the machine
translation system.

In this paper, we formally define serial verb
constructions, and classified the SVC into
several categories. These categories are related
to the analysis stage and the transfer stage of
TALK-CK. We provided a resolution algorithm
detecting SVCs in each step. Finally, at each
stage, a promising experimental result is shown.
Further research must help to better resolve
the conditional separate event SVC and
purposive separate event SVC.

<abstract confidence="0.999656473684211">Abstraction In Chinese language processing, the recognition and analysis for serial verb constructions (SVCs) is a fascinating research topic. Chinese language researchers each may have a different definition and interpretation of SVC since the structure of SVC makes Chinese unique to other languages and contains complex semantic and pragmatic information. This paper proposes a formal definition of SVC and a knowledge based approach for the recognition of SVCs, which is adopted in TOTAL-CK, a transfer-based MT system from Chinese to Korean. The recognition process is carried out in two stages: the analysis stage classifies SVCs into general categories, and the transfer stage performs further classification for Korean transfer. Some evaluation result for each stage was also given with statistics of each category of</abstract>

According to his interpretation, an SVC includes not only all the patterns noted above but also a pivot construction, a subject/object clause, and a coordinate clause, but excludes the pattern with an adjective in the V2 position. In this paper, the scope of SVC is almost same as Li’s but the classification of SVCs differs slightly, detailing the categorization in chapter 4. A few computational solutions to identifying SVCs have been proposed by some researchers. A formal description is shown in (Chan, 1998) using time lapse notation and the related definition. However, her method makes it difficult to computationally detect SVCs without the resources containing the deep level of 1 V1 : first verb, V2 : second verb, NP : noun phrase. analysis of each lexical, which is not obtainable in the current stage of language processing. 3.

Classification of Serial Verb Construction In the previous chapter, we mentioned the syntactic format of SVCs which is NP V1 (NP) V2 (NP) and the different scope of definition of SVCs by the Chinese language researches. To outline the scope of SVCs, we define SVCs in terms of dependency relation such that V1 is the head of V2, or V2 is the head of V1. It is formally defined as follows: Definition 1 Let N represent a set of nodes in a dependency tree, and W a set of words. Further Let V be a set of verbs, and P be a set of all parts of speech in Chine</context>

If the condition is always true, then we use the middle-level concept relation for detecting a restrictive separate event in order to increase the applicability of our rules. Also, the data structure of RSTM is easily represented with an adjacent matrix with the size of 21*21 4 (Sahni, 1998) where the matrix M is a square matrix, whose column and row are the middle-level concept, and if M(i,j) = 1 then concept j is semantically restricted by concept i, otherwise (i,j) ∉RSTM.

All categories of SVCs are shown in Table 2 The corresponding Chinese dependency relations to object, subject and pivot constructions also appear in the some research in Chinese language processing (Zhou &amp; Huang, 1994) but the other two are not shown due to their different viewpoints. The descriptive construction is directly able to be one-to-one mapped to the Korean counterpart. However the separate event SVCs should be further classified for Korean transfer since the separate event SVC is possibly mapped into sentences with several different Korean conjunctional particles. Thus, it is touched in the transfer stage.

Identification of SVCs To recognize SVCs, we divide the identifying process into two stages. The general categories of SVCs are able to be found at the analysis stage and the subcategories of a separated event SVC are detected in the transfer stage. 5.1 Analysis Stage To recognize the five general categories of SVCs, two resources are used: one is the Grammatical Knowledge Base of Contemporary Chinese (GKBCC) and the other is a verb list with valency information (VLVI) (Zhu et al., 1995). Checking a verb in GKBCC allows us to simply detect a pivot SVC. The remainders of the other types of SVCs should be carefully SVC sentence V2 takes VP as Sub. ? N Satisfy Valency ?
