<bodyText confidence="0.999345818181818">
In SemEval-2007, CL Research participated in
the task for Frame Semantic Structure
Extraction. Participation in this task was used as
the vehicle for efforts to integrate and exploit
FrameNet in a comprehensive text processing
system. In particular, this involved steps to build
a FrameNet dictionary with CL Research’s
DIMAP dictionary software and to use this
dictionary (along with its semantic network
processing capabilities) in processing text into
XML representations. Implementation of the
entire integrated package is only in its initial
stages and was used to make only a bare
submission of frame identification. On this task,
over all texts, a recall of 0.372, a precision of
0.553, and an F-score of 0.445 were achieved.
Considering only targets included in the DIMAP
FrameNet dictionary, the overall F-score is
0.605. These results, competitive with the top
scoring system, support continued attempts at a
dictionary-based approach to frame structure
extraction.

CL Research participated in the SemEval-2007 task
for Frame Semantic Structure Extraction. In
participating in this task, we integrated the use of
FrameNet in the Text Parser component of the CL
Research Knowledge Management System (KMS). In
particular, we created a FrameNet dictionary from
the FrameNet databases with the CL Research
DIMAP dictionary software and used this dictionary
as a lexical resource. This new lexical resource was
integrated in the same manner as other lexical
resources (including WordNet and the Oxford
Dictionary of English (ODE, 2004)). As such, the
FrameNet dictionary was available as the basis for
sense disambiguation. In the CL Research Text
Parser, this integration was seamless, in which
disambiguation can be performed against several
lexical resources. This work attempts to expand on
semantic role labeling experiments in Senseval-3
(Litkowski, 2004a, and Litkowski, 2004b).
In the following sections, we first describe the
overall structure of the CL Research Knowledge
Management System and Text Parser, describing
their general parsing and text analysis routines. Next,
we describe the creation of the FrameNet dictionary,
particularly identifying design considerations to
exploit the richness of the FrameNet data. In section
4, we describe our submission for the SemEval task.
In section 5, we describe our results. Finally, we
identify next steps that can be taken within the CL
Research KMS and DIMAP environments to extend
the FrameNet data.

<bodyText confidence="0.999774789473684">
The CL Research Knowledge Management System
(KMS) is an integrated environment for performing
several higher level applications, particularly
question answering and summarization. The
underlying architecture of KMS relies on an XML
representation of texts that captures discourse
structure and discourse elements, particularly noun
phrases, verbs, and semantic roles (predominantly as
reified in prepositions). The texts that are represented
include primarily full texts as they may appear in
several forms, but also include questions, topic
specifications for which summaries are desired, and
keyword search expressions.
Text processing is an integrated component of
KMS, but for large-scale processing, a separate
system, the CL Research Text Parser is frequently
used. The same modules are used for both, with
different interfaces. Text processing is performed in
two stages: (1) syntactic parsing, generating a parse

tree as output; and (2) discourse analysis, analyzing
the parse tree and building sets of data used to record
information about discourse segments (i.e., clauses),
discourse entities (primarily noun phrases, but also
including predicate adjective and adverb phrases),
verbs, and semantic relations (prepositions). After the
data structures are completed for an entire text during
the discourse analysis phase, they are used to create
a nested XML representation showing all the
elements and providing attributes of each component.
The parser is grammar-based and produces a
constituent structure, with non-terminals representing
syntactic components and leaves corresponding to the
words of the sentence. The parser generates some
dependency relationships by using dynamic grammar
rules added during parsing, particularly through sets
of subcategorization patterns associated with verbs
(and some other words in the dictionary). This allows
the identification of such things as sentence subjects,
preposition phrase attachments, and clause
attachments. Syntactic ambiguity is handled by
carrying forward a variable number of possible
parses (usually 40, but user adjustable for any
number), eliminating parses that are less well-formed.
The discourse analysis phase includes an
anaphora resolution component and detailed semantic
analyses of each sentence element. Many dependency
relationships are identified during this phase. The
semantic analysis includes a disambiguation
component for all words (using one or more of the
integrated dictionaries). The semantic analysis also
identifies (for later use in the XML representation)
relations between various sentence elements,
particularly identifying the complement and
attachment point for prepositions.1
To make use of the FrameNet data, it is first
necessary to put it into a form that can be used
effectively. For this purpose, a DIMAP dictionary is
used. Such dictionaries are accessible using btree
lookup, so rapid access is ensured during large-scale
text processing. Syntactic parsing proceeds at about
eight or nine hundred sentences per minute; the
discourse analysis phase is roughly the same
complexity. The result is that sentences are normally

3 A FrameNet Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967638888889">
The integration of FrameNet into KMS and Text
Parser is generally handled in the same way that
other dictionaries are used. Specifically, there is a
call to a disambiguation component to identify the
applicable sense. After this, FrameNet data are used
in a slightly different way. Disambiguation proceeds
sequentially through the words in a sentence, but the
labeling of components with frame elements is
performed only after a sentence has been fully
discourse-analyzed. This is necessary because the
location of frame elements requires full knowledge of
all components in a sentence, not just those which
precede a given target (i.e., in left-to-right parsing
and discourse analysis).
The main issue is the design of a FrameNet
dictionary; DIMAP provides sufficient capability to
capture all aspects of the FrameNet data
(Ruppenhofer, et al., 2006) in various types of built-
in data structures. First, it is necessary to capture
each lexical unit and to create a distinct sense for
each frame in which a lexeme is used. The current
FrameNet DIMAP dictionary contains 7575 entries,
with many entries having multiple senses.2 For each
sense, the FrameNet part of speech, the definition, the
frame name, the ID number, and the definition source
(identified as FN or COD, the Concise Oxford
Dictionary) are captured from the FrameNet files.3
If there is an associated FrameNet lexical entry
file that contains frame element realizations, this
information is also captured in the appropriate sense.
In DIMAP, this is done in an attribute-value feature
structure. Each non-empty feature element realization
in the FrameNet data is captured. A DIMAP feature
attribute is constructed as a conflation of the phrase
type and the grammatical function, e.g. “NP (Dep)”.
The feature value is a conflation of the valence unit

<footnote confidence="0.979097875">
2We unwittingly used an August 2006 version of
FrameNet, not the latest version that incorporated
frames developed in connection with full-text
annotation. This affects our results, as described below.
3The FrameNet dictionary data is captured using
FrameNet Explorer, a Windows interface for exploring
FrameNet frames, available for free download at CL
Research (http://www.clres.com).

frame element name and the number of annotations in
the FrameNet corpus, e.g., “Cognizer (28)”. This
manner of capturing FrameNet information is done to
facilitate processing; the DIMAP feature structure is
frequently used to access information about lexical
items. Further experience will assess the utility of this
format.
Frames and frame elements are captured in the
same dictionary. However, they are not treated as
lexical units, but rather as “meta-entries”. In the
DIMAP dictionary, frame names are entered as
dictionary entries beginning with the symbol “#” and
frame elements are entered beginning with the symbol
“@”. In these entries, different data structures of a
DIMAP entry are used to capture the different kinds
of relations between frames and frame elements (i.e.,
the frame-to-frame relations) that are found in the
FrameNet data. Thus, a frame will have a “frame-
element” link to each of its frame elements. It will
also have attribute-value features listing its frame
elements and their type (core, peripheral, or extra-
thematic).
With a dictionary structured as described, it is
possible not only to look up a lexical unit, but also to
traverse the various links that are reachable from a
given entry. Specifically, when a lexical unit is
recognized in processing the text, the first step is to
retrieve the entry for that item and to use the frame
element realization patterns to disambiguate among
the senses (if more than one of the same part of
speech). After a sentence has been completely
processed (as described above), the meta-entries
associated with each lexical unit can be examined
(and appropriate traversals to other meta-entries can
be followed) in order to identify which sentence
constituents fill the frame elements.
Specific routines for traversing the various
FrameNet links have not yet been developed.
However, this is primarily a matter of assessing
which traversals would be useful. Similar traversals
are used with other lexical resources, such as
WordNet, where, for example, inheritance hierarchies
and other WordNet relation links are routinely
traversed.

4 The SemEval FrameNet Submission
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949842105263">
To participate in the SemEval FrameNet task, the
three test texts were wrapped into a standard XML
representation used in processing texts. This wrapper
consists only of an overall &lt;DOCS&gt; tag, a subtag
&lt;DOC&gt; for each document, and a &lt;TEXT&gt; tag
surrounding the actual text. The text was included
with some minor changes. Since Text Parser includes
a sentence splitter, we had to make sure that the texts
would split into the identifiable sentences as given on
each line of the texts. Thus, for headers in the text,
we added a period at the end. Once we were sure that
the same number of sentences would be recognized,
we processed the texts using Text Parser, as
described in section 2.4
As mentioned above, the FrameNet dictionary
lookup occurred in a separate traversal of the parse
tree after the discourse analysis phase. During this
traversal, the base form of each noun, verb, adjective,
or adverb content word was looked up in the
FrameNet dictionary. If there was no entry for the
word, no further FrameNet processing was
performed. When an entry was found, each sense of
the appropriate part of speech is examined in order to
disambiguate among multiple senses. A score is
computed for each sense and the score with the
highest sense was selected.5
Having identified a sense in the FrameNet
dictionary, this was interpreted as finding a
FrameNet target, with the FrameNet frame as
identified in the lexical entry. Since the character
positions of each word in the source sentence are
included in the parse tree information, this
information was captured for inclusion in the output.
(Further implementation to identify the frame
elements associated with the target has not been
completed at this time. As a result, our submission
was only a partial completion of the FrameNet task.)
After completing the processing of each sentence,

4To make a submission for the FrameNet task, it was
necessary to initialize an XML object into which the
results could be inserted after processing each
sentence. This is not a usual component of Text Parser,
but was implemented solely for the purpose of
participating in this task.
5At this time, all senses receive an identical score. The
first sense is selected. Senses are unsystematically
ordered as they were encountered in creating the
FrameNet dictionary. This will be extended to compute
a score based on the various frame element realization
patterns associated with each sense.

had been completed, the XML object was printed to

6 Future Steps

<bodyText confidence="0.99995325">
Participation in the FrameNet frame structure
extraction task has demonstrated the basic viability
of our approach. Many of the frames have been
recognized successfully. We have not yet examined
the extent to which the disambiguation among frames
is significant, particularly since there are not many
entries that have several senses. We have yet to
develop specific techniques for making use of the
frame element realization patterns. However, we
believe that a reasonable performance can be
expected since KMS and Text Parser produce output
that breaks sentences down into the types of
components that should be included as frame
elements.
The architecture of KMS, Text Parser, and
DIMAP provide significant opportunities for
extending our performance. In particular, since these
systems include the Oxford Dictionary of English, a
superset of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, there is
an opportunity for extending the FrameNet datasets.
The COD definitions in FrameNet can be mapped to
those in ODE and can be exploited to extend
FrameNet frames to lexical items not yet covered in
FrameNet.
