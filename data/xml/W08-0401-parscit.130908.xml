Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999812677419355">
In current statistical machine translation
(SMT), erroneous word reordering is one of
the most serious problems. To resolve this
problem, many word-reordering constraint
techniques have been proposed. The inver-
sion transduction grammar (ITG) is one of
these constraints. In ITG constraints, target-
side word order is obtained by rotating nodes
of the source-side binary tree. In these node
rotations, the source binary tree instance is
not considered. Therefore, stronger con-
straints for word reordering can be obtained
by imposing further constraints derived from
the source tree on the ITG constraints. For
example, for the source word sequence { a
b c d }, ITG constraints allow a total of
twenty-two target word orderings. How-
ever, when the source binary tree instance ((a
b) (c d)) is given, our proposed ”imposing
source tree on ITG” (IST-ITG) constraints
allow only eight word orderings. The re-
duction in the number of word-order permu-
tations by our proposed stronger constraints
efficiently suppresses erroneous word order-
ings. In our experiments with IST-ITG using
the NIST MT08 English-to-Chinese transla-
tion track’s data, the proposed method re-
sulted in a 1.8-points improvement in char-
acter BLEU-4 (35.2 to 37.0) and a 6.2%
lower CER (74.1 to 67.9%) compared with
our baseline condition.

translation paradigms is the phrase-based model
(PBSMT) (Marcu et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003;
Och et al., 2004). In PBSMT, errors in word re-
ordering, especially in global reordering, are one of
the most serious problems. Approaches used to re-
solve this problem are categorized into two types.
The first type is linguistically syntax-based. In this
approach, source (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006;
Huang et al., 2006), target (Yamada et al., 2000; Gal-
ley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), or both side
(Melamed 2004; Ding et al., 2005) tree structures
are used for model training. The second type is for-
mal constraints on word permutations. IBM con-
straints (Berger et al., 1996), lexical word reordering
model (Tillmann, 2004), and inversion transduction
grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997)
belong to this type of approach. Our approach is an
extension of ITG constraints and is a hybrid of the
first and second type of approach.
We propose ”imposing source tree on ITG” (IST-
ITG) constraints for directly introducing source sen-
tence structure into our set of constraints. In IST-
ITG, ITG constraints under the given source sen-
tence tree structure are used as stronger constraints
than the original ITG. For example, IST-ITG allows
only eight word orderings for a four-word sentence,
even though twenty-two word orderings are possible
with respect of in the original ITG constraints.
In Section 2, we present the proposed IST-ITG
for word-based translation. In Section 3, the pro-
posed method is extended to phrase-based transla-
tion. In Section 4, we present a real-time decoding
algorithm for IST-ITG constraints. In Section 5, we
give details of the experiments and present the re-
sults. Finally, in Section 6, we offer a summary and
some concluding remarks.

2 Imposing the Source Tree on ITG
Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999382">
First, we introduce three previous studies on word
reordering constraints: IBM constraints; lexical re-
ordering model; and ITG constraints. Here, we con-
sider one-to-one word-aligned source and target lan-
guage sentence pairs as the simplest cases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.889612">
2.1 IBM constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997525">
In this constraint, a distortion penalty is given in ac-
cordance with the gap between the previously and
the currently translated words, which is represented
as the following equation.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9833945">
�pD = exp(− di) (1)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996475">

di = abs(position(ei−1) + 1 − position(ei)) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823571428571">
where ei represents the translated word from the ith
source word fi, position(w) represents the position
of the word w. Sometimes, a limit is set for di
for similar language pairs such as French and En-
glish. However, for dissimilar language pairs, such
as Japanese and English or Chinese and English,
limiting di is not beneficial.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998379">
2.2 Lexical Reordering Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999116">
In the lexical reordering model, reordering proba-
bilities are assigned to each word pair {fi, ei}. Re-
ordering positions are categorized into three types,
monotone, swap, and discontinuous. The probabil-
ity is assigned to left and right sides as ps(t|fi, ei),
where, s is left (l) or right (r), t is monotone (m),
swap (s), or discontinuous (d). Therefore, a total of
six probabilities are assigned to each word pair. For
the source word sub-sequence fi−1, fi, probabilities
of target sub-sequences are calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999498">
• p(ei−1, ei) = pr(m|fi−1, ei−1)pl(m|fi, ei)
• p(ei, ei−1) = pr(s|fi−1, ei−1)pl(s|fi, ei)
• p(otherwise) = pr(d|fi−1, ei−1)pl(d|fi, ei)
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991087">
2.3 ITG Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999616857142857">
In one-to-one word-alignment, the source word fi is
translated into the target word ei. The source sen-
tence [f1, f2, ..., fN] is translated into a reordered
sequence of word [e1, e2, ..., eN]. The number of re-
orderings is N!. When ITG is introduced, this com-
bination N! can be reduced in accordance with the
following constraints.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998327">
• All possible binary tree structures are generated
from the source word sequence.
• The target sentence is obtained by rotating any
node of the binary trees.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992262857142857">
When N = 4, the ITG constraints can re-
duce the number of combinations from 4! =
24 to 22 by rejecting combinations [e3, e1, e4, e2]
and [e2, e4, e1, e3]. For a 4-word sentence,
the search space is reduced to 92%(22/24), but
for 10-word sentence, the search space is only
6%(206,098/3,628,800) of the original full space.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997983">
2.4 Imposing Source Tree Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998635263157895">
In ITG constraints, the source-side binary tree
instance is not considered. Therefore, if the
source sentence binary tree is utilized, stronger
constraints than the original ITG can be created.
By parsing the source sentence, a parse tree is
obtained. After parsing, a bracketed sentence is
obtained by removing the node labels, and this
bracketed sentence can be converted to a binary
tree. For example, the parse tree, (S1 (S (NP (DT
This)) (VP (AUX is) (NP (DT a) (NN pen))))),
is obtained from the source sentence ”This is a
pen”. By removing the node labels, a bracketed
sentence ((This) ((is) ((a) (pen)))) is obtained. Such
a bracketed sentence (equivalent to a binary tree)
can be used to produce constraints. If IST-ITG is
applied, the number of word orderings in N = 4 is
reduced to 8, down from 22 with ITG. For example,
for the source-side bracketed tree ((f1 f2)(f3 f4)),
eight target sequences [e1, e2, e3, e4], [e2, e1, e3, e4],
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.880066">
[e1, e2, e4, e3], [e2, e1, e4, e3], [e3, e4, e1, e2],
[e3, e4, e2, e1], [e4, e3, e1, e2], and [e4, e3, e2, e1]
are accepted. For the source-side bracketed tree
(((f1 f2)f3)f4), eight sequences [e1, e2, e3, e4],
[e2, e1, e3, e4], [e3, e1, e2, e4], [e3, e1, e2, e4],
[e4, e1, e2, e3], [e4, e2, e1, e3], [e4, e3, e1, e2], and
2
[e4, e3, e2, e1] are accepted. Generally, the number

word sequence for each N with ITG, IST-ITG, and

2.5 Extension to Non-binary Tree
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995835857142857">
In the above subsection, a source binary tree was as-
sumed in order to perform IST-ITG. However, pars-
ing results sometimes are not binary trees. In this
case, some tree nodes have more than two branches.
For a non-binary node, any reordering of branches is
allowed. In a non-binary tree (f1(f2 f3 f4)), twelve
target-side sequences [e1, e2, e3, e4], [e1, e2, e4, e3],

[e4, e3, e2, e1] are allowed. For nodes that have more

allowed in the target-side and represented by the

3 IST-ITG in Phrase-based SMT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977571428571">
In the above section, we described each constraint
in the case of a one-to-one word-alignment. In this
section, we consider phrase-based models. When
a phrase-based model is used, each constraint must
be extended. For IBM constraints, equation (2) is
rewritten using phrase Pen instead of word en as
follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9937545">
di = abs(last position(Pei−1) + 1
−first position(Pei)) (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855166666667">
where last position(Pen) represents the posi-
tion of the last word in nth phrase, and
first position(Pen) represents the position of the
first word in nth phrase. The lexical reordering
model and ITG constraints can be extended by
changing the model (or constraint) unit from ”word”
to ”phrase”. However, in IST-ITG, ”word” must be
used for the constraint unit since the parse (brack-
eted tree) unit is in ”words”. To absorb different
units between translation models and IST-ITG con-
straints, we investigated a new limitation for word
ordering as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988832">
• Word ordering that destroys a phrase is not al-
lowed.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998297">
When this limitation is applied, the translated word
ordering is obtained from the bracketed source sen-
tence tree by reordering the nodes in the tree, the
same as for one-to-one word-alignment. According
to this limitation, the following nodes cannot be re-
ordered. If a sub-tree with root node X includes part
of a phrase ph, node X cannot be reordered. Con-
sider the source bracketed source tree ( ( ea eb ec )
( ( ed ee ) ( ef eg ) ) ), in which eb ec, and ed form
a phrase eph as in Figure 1. Node 1 cannot be re-
ordered since part of the phrase eb ec is included in
node 1’s sub-tree. For the same reason, node 2 and 4
cannot be reordered. Node 3 can be reordered since
the sub-tree does not include the phrase (target se-
quence [fafphfefgff] is obtained by rotating node
3). Node 5 also can be reordered since it includes
the whole phrase (target sequence [fgfffefphfa] is
obtained by rotating node 5). If node 2 is reordered,
phrase ph is split into two parts, and translated in
two parts in the target sentence. It is inconsistent

with the condition that phrase-to-phrase alignment
is one-to-one. As a result, only the target sequences
[fafphfefffg], [fafphfefgff], [fgfffefphfa], and
[fffgfefphfa] are allowed. Here, fph represents an
equivalent phrase in the translation for eph.

4 Decoding with IST-ITG Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999576615384616">
In this section, we describe a one-pass decoding
algorithm that uses IST-ITG constraints in the de-
coder. The translation target sentence is sequen-
tially generated from left (sentence head) to right
(sentence tail). To introduce the IST-ITG constraints
into a decoder, the target candidate must be checked
whether it satisfies the IST-ITG constraints or not
whenever a new phrase is selected to extend a target
candidate.
To explain this checking algorithm, we catego-
rized source sub-trees into four types UNTRANS-
LATED, TRANSLATED, TRANSLATING, and
NG (no good) as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999738538461538">
• If a sub-tree consists of only leaf word nodes,
and all leaf words are not yet translated, this
sub-tree is defined as UNTRANSLATED.
• If a sub-tree consists of only UNTRANS-
LATED sub-trees, this sub-tree is also UN-
TRANSLATED.
• If a sub-tree consists of only leaf word nodes,
and all leaf words are already translated, this
sub-tree is defined as TRANSLATED.
• If a sub-tree consists of only TRANSLATED
sub-trees, this sub-tree is also TRANSLATED.
• If a sub-tree includes NG sub-tree, this sub-tree
is also NG.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.928442545454546">
If a translation candidate includes TRANSLAT-
ING sub-tree t, t must become TRANSLATED
before anything else can happen. Given sub-tree
((ab)c), a is translated, b and c are not yet trans-
lated. In this case, b must be translated before c.
If c is translated before b, the target word order be-
comes ACB. This word order does not satisfy the
IST-ITG constraints. For the same reason, a can-
didate that includes an NG sub-tree does not satisfy
the IST-ITG constraints. The checking algorithm for
IST-ITG constraints is as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999204647058824">
1. For old translation candidates, the smallest
TRANSLATING sub-tree t and its untrans-
lated part u are calculated.
2. When a new target phrase fph is generated, the
source phrase eph and untranslated part u cal-
culated in above step are compared. If eph does
not include and is not included in u, the new
candidate is rejected. For example, in Figure
1, only source word ea is already translated.
The smallest TRANSLATING sub-tree is 1
and its untranslated part u is [ebe,]. In this case,
phrases containing [eb], [e,], or [ebe,] are ac-
cepted since these are included in u. Phrases
[ebe,ed] or [ebe,edee] are also accepted since
these include u.

We evaluated the proposed method using four eval-
uation measures, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
NIST (Doddington 2002), WER(word error rate),

fore discussing the evaluation, the characteristics of
each one are analyzed.

<listItem confidence="0.996001">
• BLEU: This evaluation measure takes
into account middle range word order,
but does not take into account global
word order. When the translation result is
[w1, w2, ..., wj_1, X, wj+1, ..., wn] for refer-
ence translation [w1, w2, ..., wn], both WER
and BLEU scores will be high. For a transla-
tion result [wj+1, ..., wn, X, w1, w2, ..., wj_1],
the BLEU score will be the same as the
previous result since BLEU only takes into
account 4grams. However, the WER score will
be zero since global word positions are taken
into account. Therefore, the effectiveness of
the proposed method using BLEU is less than
that of using WER.
• NIST: This evaluation measure only takes into
account n-grams like BLEU. However, impor-
tance of higher order n-grams are less than
BLEU. Therefore, the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method using NIST will be less than that
of using BLEU.
• WER: This evaluation measure takes into ac-

The translation direction of the first experiment
was English-to-Japanese (E-J). For phrase-based
translation model training, we used the GIZA++
toolkit (Och et al., 2003). For language model train-
ing, the SRI language model tool kit (Stolcke 2002)
was used. The language model type was word 5-
gram smoothed by Kneser-Ney discounting (Kneser
1995). For tuning of decoder parameters, we con-
ducted minimum error training (Och 2003) with re-
spect to the BLEU score using 916 development
sentence pairs. For extraction of source sentence
tree structure, we used the Charniak parser (Char-
niak 2000). We used Chasen for segmentation of the
Japanese. The numbers of entries in the language
models were 0.1 M, 2.1 M, 4.3 M, 6.2 M, and 6.9 M
for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5grams respectively. The number
of entries in the phrase-table was 76 M. For decod-
ing, we used an in-house decoder that is a close rel-
ative to the Moses decoder. The performance of this
decoder was configured to be the same as Moses.
Another conditions are the same as the default con-
ditions of Moses decoder.
In the previous work (Zens et al., 2003, 2004),
an IBM constraints and an ITG constraints are com-

Table 3 shows the following experimental results.
In comparing the original ITG constraints (ITG)
with the proposed IST-ITG (IST) method, the im-
provement in BLEU was 2.67 points, and in WER
was 5.39%. WER had the largest improvement, next
was BLEU. This particular improvement order was
the same as in the previous subsection. The large im-
provement of WER helped us confirm the effective-
ness of the proposed method for global word order-
ing. When IBM constraints were used at the same
time (IBM+ITG and IBM+IST), the BLEU score
improved by 1.57 points and WER improved by
4.63%. When the lexical reordering model was used
at the same time (IBM+LR and IBM+LR+IST),
BLEU improved by 1.03 points and WER improved
by 5.12%. The lexical reordering model fixed phrase
position for the monotone and swap categories, but
did not fix phrase position for the discontinuous cat-

continuous category, even though it did not assign
a probability. Combinations of the lexical reorder-
ing model and IST-ITG resulted in a better WER
than with both IBM+LR and IBM+IST since both
position and probability could be assigned for the
discontinuous category.

Next, we conducted J-E translation experiments
using the same corpus. The numbers of entries in
the language models were 0.2 M, 3.1 M, 4.1 M, 5.7
M, and 5.9 M for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5grams The im-
provement. The number of entries in the phrase-

the dependency structure analyzer CaboCha. From
the dependency structure, Japanese bracketed trees
were generated. The combination of constraints in
these experiments was the same as those of the E-J
translation experiments.
Table 4 shows the translation results of sentence
evaluation with the top five alignment scores. In
comparing the original ITG constraints (ITG) with
the proposed IST-ITG (IST), BLEU was improved
by 1.21 points, and by in 3.81% in WER. The
largest improvement was in WER, and BLEU had
the next largest. This particular improvement order
of these evaluation measures was the same as that
of the E-J translation experiments. When IBM con-
straints were used at the same time (IBM+ITG and

WER improved by 3.89%. When the lexical reorder-
ing model was used at the same time (IBM+LR and

BLEU, but WER improved by 4.47%. One pos-
sible reason for the small (or no) improvement in
BLEU is the lower parsing accuracy of Japanese
compared with that of the English. However, better

straints leads to better word order. In the Appendix,

Next, we conducted English-to-Chinese (E-C) news-
paper translation experiments for different language
pairs. The training and evaluation corpora were used
in the NIST MT08 evaluation campaign English-to-
Chinese translation track. For the translation model
training, we used 6.2M bilingual sentences. For the
language model training, we used 20.1M sentences.
A development set with 1,664 sentences was used
as evaluation data in the Chinese-to-English transla-
tion track in the NIST MT07 evaluation campaign.
A single reference was used in the development
set. The evaluation set with 1,859 sentences is the
same as MT08’s evaluation data, with 4 references.
Model training and decoding conditions were the
same as those in the E-J experiments. In both base-
line and proposed condition, IBM constraints and
lexical reordering model were used at the same time.
Therefore, the baseline conditions correspond to the
IBM+LR condition in the J-E experiments, the pro-
posed conditions correspond to the IBM+LR+IST in
the J-E experiments.
The evaluation unit was both the Chinese char-
acter and word as defined by the PKU corpus. As

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941558823529">
We proposed new word reordering constraints for
PBSMT using source tree structure. The proposed
IST-ITG constraints are extensions of the ITG con-
straints. In ITG constraints, the instance of the
source-side tree is not taken into account. On the
other hand, in IST-ITG constraints, the tree that
is obtained by source sentence parsing is imposed
on the decoding process. Therefore, IST-ITG con-
straints are stronger than those of the original ITG.
For example, for four-word source sentences, IST-
ITG constraints allow eight word orderings in a tar-
get sentence compared with twenty-two orderings
under the original ITG constraints. IST-ITG con-
straints can be applied to a common decoder to de-
termine a target sentence from one-pass without re-
scoring. In our E-J patent translation experiments,
the proposed method resulted in a 2.7-point im-
provement in BLEU and a 5.7% improvement in
WER compared with those of the original ITG con-
straints. In this paper we have argued the WER is
the most appropriate measure to gauge the effective-
ness of our approach since it gives importance to the
global word order. Our approach gave rise to con-
siderable gains in term of WER in all of our experi-
ments, indicating that a respectable improvement in
global word order was achieved. The improvement
could clearly be seen from visual inspection of the
output, a few examples of which are presented in
the following Appendix.

<abstract confidence="0.99979234375">In current statistical machine translation (SMT), erroneous word reordering is one of the most serious problems. To resolve this problem, many word-reordering constraint techniques have been proposed. The inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is one of these constraints. In ITG constraints, targetside word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side binary tree. In these node rotations, the source binary tree instance is not considered. Therefore, stronger constraints for word reordering can be obtained by imposing further constraints derived from the source tree on the ITG constraints. For for the source word sequence c d ITG constraints allow a total of twenty-two target word orderings. However, when the source binary tree instance ((a b) (c d)) is given, our proposed ”imposing source tree on ITG” (IST-ITG) constraints allow only eight word orderings. The reduction in the number of word-order permutations by our proposed stronger constraints efficiently suppresses erroneous word orderings. In our experiments with IST-ITG using the NIST MT08 English-to-Chinese translation track’s data, the proposed method resulted in a 1.8-points improvement in character BLEU-4 (35.2 to 37.0) and a 6.2% lower CER (74.1 to 67.9%) compared with our baseline condition.</abstract>

In PBSMT, errors in word reordering, especially in global reordering, are one of the most serious problems. Approaches used to resolve this problem are categorized into two types. The first type is linguistically syntax-based. In this approach, source (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), target (Yamada et al., 2000; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), or both side (Melamed 2004; Ding et al., 2005) tree structures are used for model training. The second type is formal constraints on word permutations. IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996), lexical word reordering model (Tillmann, 2004), and inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) belong to this type of approach. Our approach is an extension of ITG constraints and is a hybrid of the first and second type of approach. We propose ”imposing source tree on ITG” (ISTITG) constraints for directly introducing source sentence structure into our set of constraints. In ISTITG, ITG constraints under the given source sentence tree structure are used as stronger constraints than the original ITG.

For phrase-based translation model training, we used the GIZA++ toolkit (Och et al., 2003). For language model training, the SRI language model tool kit (Stolcke 2002) was used. The language model type was word 5- gram smoothed by Kneser-Ney discounting (Kneser 1995). For tuning of decoder parameters, we conducted minimum error training (Och 2003) with respect to the BLEU score using 916 development sentence pairs. For extraction of source sentence tree structure, we used the Charniak parser (Charniak 2000). We used Chasen for segmentation of the Japanese. The numbers of entries in the language models were 0.1 M, 2.1 M, 4.3 M, 6.2 M, and 6.9 M for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5grams respectively. The number of entries in the phrase-table was 76 M. For decoding, we used an in-house decoder that is a close relative to the Moses decoder. The performance of this decoder was configured to be the same as Moses. Another conditions are the same as the default conditions of Moses decoder. In the previous work (Zens et al., 2003, 2004), an IBM constraints and an ITG constraints are compared.

<context position="2385" citStr="Melamed 2004" startWordPosition="359" endWordPosition="360">hods are widely used for machine translation. One of the popular statistical machine 1 translation paradigms is the phrase-based model (PBSMT) (Marcu et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och et al., 2004). In PBSMT, errors in word reordering, especially in global reordering, are one of the most serious problems. Approaches used to resolve this problem are categorized into two types. The first type is linguistically syntax-based. In this approach, source (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), target (Yamada et al., 2000; Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), or both side (Melamed 2004; Ding et al., 2005) tree structures are used for model training. The second type is formal constraints on word permutations. IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996), lexical word reordering model (Tillmann, 2004), and inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) belong to this type of approach. Our approach is an extension of ITG constraints and is a hybrid of the first and second type of approach. We propose ”imposing source tree on ITG” (ISTITG) constraints for directly introducing source sentence structure into our set of constraints. In ISTITG, ITG constraints under</context>

For phrase-based translation model training, we used the GIZA++ toolkit (Och et al., 2003). For language model training, the SRI language model tool kit (Stolcke 2002) was used. The language model type was word 5- gram smoothed by Kneser-Ney discounting (Kneser 1995). For tuning of decoder parameters, we conducted minimum error training (Och 2003) with respect to the BLEU score using 916 development sentence pairs. For extraction of source sentence tree structure, we used the Charniak parser (Charniak 2000). We used Chasen for segmentation of the Japanese. The numbers of entries in the language models were 0.1 M, 2.1 M, 4.3 M, 6.2 M, and 6.9 M for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5grams respectively. The number of entries in the phrase-table was 76 M. For decoding, we used an in-house decoder that is a close relative to the Moses decoder. The performance of this decoder was configured to be the same as Moses.

If eph does not include and is not included in u, the new candidate is rejected. For example, in Figure 1, only source word ea is already translated. The smallest TRANSLATING sub-tree is 1 and its untranslated part u is [ebe,]. In this case, phrases containing [eb], [e,], or [ebe,] are accepted since these are included in u. Phrases [ebe,ed] or [ebe,edee] are also accepted since these include u. 3. If a new candidate includes NG sub-trees, this candidate is rejected. 4 5 Experiments 5.1 Evaluation Measures We evaluated the proposed method using four evaluation measures, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington 2002), WER(word error rate), and PER(position independent word error rate). Before discussing the evaluation, the characteristics of each one are analyzed. • BLEU: This evaluation measure takes into account middle range word order, but does not take into account global word order. When the translation result is [w1, w2, ..., wj_1, X, wj+1, ..., wn] for reference translation [w1, w2, ..., wn], both WER and BLEU scores will be high. For a translation result [wj+1, ..., wn, X, w1, w2, ..., wj_1], the BLEU score will be the same as the previous result since BLEU only takes into </context>
