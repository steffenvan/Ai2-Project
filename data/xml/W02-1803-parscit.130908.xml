This paper describes the CTB Coreference An-
notation Guidelines for annotating the pronom-
inal anaphoric expressions in the Penn Chinese
Treebank (CTB). The purpose of the annota-
tion is twofold: to provide training data for
learning-based pronoun resolution tools, and to
provide a &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; standard to use in evaluating
the outputs of pronoun resolution algorithms.
There were two annotation tasks: coindex-
ing anaphors with NP antecedents whenever
possible, and classifying the non-coindexable
anaphors into categories. While the coindexing
of pronominal anaphors (including the zero pro-
noun) with their antecedents (or postcedents)
was fairly straightforward, the categorization of
those pronominal expressions that did not re-
fer to nominal entities in the text raised a some
questions which are discussed below.
2 What we are annotating
Annotations were made to the parsed files of the
June, 2001 corrected release of the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank (Xia et al., 2000). Example 1

and Leass, 1994; Morton, 2000)), only third-
person pronouns and demonstratives were cho-
sen to be annotated. The pronouns include re-
flexives (e.g., /&amp;quot;oneself&amp;quot;), reciprocals (e.g.,
/&amp;quot;one another&amp;quot;), and possessives. For the
possessives, the only distinct possessive forms
are and (both &amp;quot;its/his/hers/theirs&amp;quot;), which
are annotated. Ordinary third-person pronouns
in possessive constructions are annotated just
as they would be in other contexts.
Unlike English, however, Chinese is a pro-
drop language, and there are zero pronouns in
addition to the overt ones. For pro drop, the
Bracketing Guidelines for the CTB (Xue and
Xia, 2000) specify use of the string &amp;quot;*pro*&amp;quot;
(small pro) to explicitly denote a zero pronoun
in a dropped subject or dropped object position
in a parse tree.
Not all empty subject positions in the CTB
parses are the result of pro drop, however. The
Bracketing Guidelines specify use of the string
&amp;quot;*PRO*&amp;quot; (big PRO) when there is a non-overt
subject in a clause that is the complement of
a control verb, such as /&amp;quot;decide&amp;quot; (subject
control) or /&amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; (object control)&apos;.
The Guidelines (Section VI.4) also state that
*PRO* is to be used as the non-overt subject in
&amp;quot;non-finite clauses,&amp;quot; typically clauses that are
themselves sentential subjects. Big *PRO* is
in complementary distribution with lexicalized
constituents2, while *pro* is not so restricted.
The coreference annotation task only deals
with the zero pronouns, or small *pro*, in the
CTB parses. The big *PRO*s are ignored, just
as they are in a coreference task in English.

2.2 What kind of antecedents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772444444444">
We specify that anaphors are to be coindexed
only with entities that are represented in the
text by lexicalized noun phrases, or in some
cases quantifier phrases, QPs.
Antecedent entities that must be inferred, or
antecedents that are events or propositions, for
example, cannot be coindexed with any overt
NP, and are to be labeled with one of the cate-
gories described in Section 5.

&apos;Note that *pro* and *PRO* do not represent move-
ment. Movement is denoted using other empty category
labels. Refer to the Bracketing Guidelines, Section VI:

Theory. See, for example, (Haegeman, 1994).

3 Two tasks: coindexing and
categorizing
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999754">
As in other languages, pronouns not only are
used to refer to explicit nominal phrases in the
text, but also are used discourse deictically and
in an existential manner. In addition, they can
refer to nominal entities that are not explicitly
mentioned in the text, but that are available
through inference.
The approach taken to annotation was there-
fore twofold.
The first task was to classify each overt pro-
noun, demonstrative, and small pro either as a
coindexable anaphor that was coreferential with
a noun phrase that explicitly appeared in the
text, or as an anaphor that belonged to one of
a set of categories of non-coindexable anaphors.
The second task was to assign indices to the
coindexable anaphors and their antecedents.
We will first describe the questions that arose
in the coindexation task, then discuss the cate-
gorization of the non-coindexable pronouns.

4 Choices in coindexing overt
nominal antecedents
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992315">
4.1 Nesting level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999955">
When NPs are nested, such that an embedded
NP refers to the same entity as the NP that
contains it, there is a choice between annotat-
ing the head NP at the lowest level vs. anno-
tating the top NP. The choice to annotate high,
rather than at the head NP, was made for two
reasons. One was that the head may be auto-
matically recovered from the parent. The sec-
ond was that including the modifying material
uniquely identifies entities that are different but
that have identical lexical heads.
In Example 2, the overt NPs that are tagged
with the indices #3 and #4 have identical head
NPs, but one is actually a subset of the other.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961908">
4.2 NP apposition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.949766421052632">
The only exception to annotating high was in
a particular kind of construction with NP ap-
position, namely those NP-APP that had the
pattern
(NP (NP-APP (title/descriptive phrase))
(NP (name)))
In that case, either the title or full descrip-
tive NP alone referred to the same entity de-
noted by the name, and the taggers were asked
to annotate both the NP-APP and the head NP
containing the name.
In more complex appositive constructions,
the NP-APP usually was a list, ending in etc.,
of sample members of a set that was denoted
by the head noun. Since the list was exemplary,
rather than definitive, NPs containing such lists
were to be annotated only at the parent level.
That is, the NP-APP constituent was treated
as another modifier, rather than as a referent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990684">
4.3 NP-Predicate constructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996595375">
When the antecedent of a pronoun, demonstra-
tive, or *pro* is a subject that is followed by the
copula or and a predicate NP (NP-PRD)
with definite reference, then the annotators were
instructed to put the entity&apos;s index not only on
the subject, but also the NP-PRD. Example 3
illustrates this.
Analogous to this, there are verbs that estab-
lish identity between their subjects and objects,
usually after a change of state. These verbs are
words like &amp;quot;become&amp;quot; ( ) or &amp;quot;establish&amp;quot; ( ) .
When subjects in these constructions were an-
tecedents, the annotators were asked to index
any NP-OBJ with definite reference as well.
Example 4 shows one such instance with the
verb /&amp;quot;become.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995837">
4.4 Quantifier phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999822611111111">
Although syntactically, quantifier phrases
(QPs) occur in the same contexts as NPs in
the CTB, they are not necessarily equivalent
in their semantic usage. While an NP denotes
an entity, a QP usually denotes the value of a
quantifiable property or attribute of an entity,
rather than the entity itself.
Note that in Example 2 the QP-OBJ &amp;quot;109.82
billion US$&amp;quot; in the first clause was not anno-
tated. Entity #3 is &amp;quot;the value of imports and
exports&amp;quot;, and the extent of that value is 109.82
billion at one particular time. But the measure
does not uniquely denote the entity.
On the other hand, quantifier phrases may
sometimes be abbreviated expressions denoting
a particular set of entities, in which case the QP
constituent is annotated as if it were an NP.
Example 5 illustrates such a case. The

of the categories. A discussion of each category
follows.

5.1.1 AMB: ambiguous
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996144">
This category is intended to identify cases in
which a particular anaphor, whether an overt
lexical item or a zero pronoun, could have more
than one possible interpretation, depending on
the understanding of the reader. The ambigu-
ity may be between two or more possible NP
antecedents in the text for example, or it may
be between an entity denoted by an NP in the
text and an entity that is not lexicalized but can
be inferred.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.917674">
5.1.2 DD: discourse deictic
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999274">
Pronouns are often used to refer to events or
propositions as well as to entities. When an
anaphor refers to an event or proposition or
to the meaning of an entire span of text, then
it is labeled DD, for discourse deictic. Note
that in addition to the demonstratives /&amp;quot;this&amp;quot;
and /&amp;quot;this&amp;quot; that one would expect to be used
for this purpose, there were situations in which
*pro* was tagged with this label as well.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.960681">
5.1.3 EXT: existential
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999566">
Analogous to pleonastic constructions in
English, the verbs ( ) /&amp;quot;(not)have&amp;quot; and
/&amp;quot;without&amp;quot; in Chinese can be used in an
&amp;quot;existential&amp;quot; manner. When they are, they
have the part-of-speech tag VE3. The label
EXT is used to tag *pro* when it is the
subject of one of these verbs (and the verb has
the reading &amp;quot;there are&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;there are no&amp;quot; ).
Examples 1 and 5 contain *pro*&apos;s annotated in
this way.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.924724">
5.1.4 INFR: inferrable
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999756736842105">
The coindexing task is very restricted in that
the only antecedents that can be assigned in-
dices are NP constituents in the same doc-
ument that denote the same entity that the
anaphor refers to. The label INFR is to be
used when the anaphor refers to an entity that
is not itself explicitly lexicalized in the text, but
can be inferred from the context or using real-
world knowledge. The entity must be a partic-
ular nominal entity, not a generic &amp;quot;anyperson&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;anything&amp;quot; with arbitrary reading (see Sec-
tion 5.2, below).
For example, the pronoun /&amp;quot;they&amp;quot; might
be used to refer to the people in charge of some
place/institution, but the only overt NP in the
text is the place/institution itself. The real an-
tecedent of the pronoun, a reference to the peo-
ple themselves, is not overtly mentioned in the
text, so the anaphor would be labeled INFR.

<bodyText confidence="0.999964173333333">
The above categories describe the manifesta-
tions of discourse phenomena that are familiar
to English speakers as well as to Chinese speak-
ers. The final category applies only to small
*pro*, and is more specific to the phenomena
observed in the parses in CTB-I.
In the first version of the guidelines, there
were five categories: the four just mentioned,
plus an &amp;quot;ANONymous&amp;quot; category that was
meant to account for arbitrary dropped sub-
jects in titles or slogans (analogous to the use
of &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; in English). During the initial adjudi-
cation meetings, however, it became clear that
there were occurrences of small *pro* that did
not fall neatly into any of the five proposed cat-
egories.
Many of these *pro*&apos;s appeared in subordi-
nate constructions that functioned like English
infinitives and gerundive clauses, and they fre-
quently could not be replaced by any overt NP,
even a pronoun. For these reasons, a sixth cat-
egory, labeled UNTNS for untensed, was added
to the guidelines in an attempt to capture a
meaningful category of dropped subjects.
Unfortunately, adding this category caused
more problems than it solved. First, it was
too hard to clearly define. The reason it was
difficult to define is the same reason that the
question of a finite vs. non-finite distinction in
Chinese is so problematic: there is no reliable
diagnostic of (non-)finiteness in Chinese (and,
some would argue, no non-finite/finite distinc-
tion at all (Hu et al., 2001)).
In the absence of diagnostic tests, the Guide-
lines described the category using sample syn-
tactic structures. Although there are a few syn-
tactic structures such as sentence-initial pur-
pose clauses that appear to be &amp;quot;prototypical&amp;quot;
untensed constructions, there are many more
structures that require more subjective judge-
ments.
Second, even if a diagnostic test for UNTNS
were available, there were two basic difficulties
with adding the UNTNS category. The first
problem was that just as big PRO can be coin-
dexed (e.g., in subject or object control con-
texts), in a similar way the *pro* in the &amp;quot;un-
tensed&amp;quot; syntactic structures could sometimes be
coindexed with an NP. This presented a prob-
lem with consistently annotating such a *pro*:
should it be coindexed or marked UNTNS?
The second difficulty with just adding
UNTNS to the coreference Guidelines was that
both of the categories ANON and UNTNS con-
tained *pro*&apos;s with arbitrary reference, and
there was no clean way to differentiate them. A
diagnostic that an ANON *pro* could be sub-
stituted by an overt NP was not sufficient.
As a result of these two overlaps (UNTNS
that could be coindexed, and arbitrary refer-
ences in both ANON and UNTNS), there was
reliably poor inter-annotator agreement in an-
notating *pro*&apos;s belonging to these categories.
To simplify the categorization, therefore, the
decision was made on the one hand to replace
the ANON and the UNTNS categories with the
single category ARB (for &amp;quot;arbitrary&amp;quot;), and on
the other hand to instruct the annotators to
always coindex a *pro* when possible. That
is, any *pro* that can be coindexed, whether
or not it appears in an &amp;quot;infinitival&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gerun-
dive&amp;quot; construction, and whether or not it can
be replaced by an overt NP, should be coin-
dexed. Only those *pro*&apos;s that have arbitrary
readings, with no possible specific or inferrable

With respect to training a tool to do auto-

most common clauses with dropped subjects in
this position are sentence-initial purpose clauses
with /&amp;quot;in order to&amp;quot; and adverbial IPs with
verbs like /&amp;quot;utilize&amp;quot;.
Example 8 illustrates a *pro* subject of an
IP that is itself the matrix subject.
Pre-verbal modifier prepositional phrases
with IP complements, like the sentence-level
adverbials, sometimes act like infinitives and
sometimes like gerunds. Some have *pro* sub-

phrases headed by /&amp;quot;for&amp;quot;). Others, such as
manner PPs with /&amp;quot;using&amp;quot; appear less likely

Initially 40 files were annotated by two native
speakers of Mandarin, both from Taipei, Tai-
wan. One is a trained linguist, the other is
a computer science graduate student who has
taken a syntax course. In the process of an-
notating and adjudicating, the Guidelines were
revised, to broaden the definition of INFR from
a more narrow interpretation and to add the
UNTNS category and distinguish it from the
ANON category.
Those Guidelines were used by two annota-
tors to independently annotate all the remain-
ing files in CTB-I for coindexation only. The an-
notators are two native speakers who are trained
linguists. One is from the Peoples Republic of
China, the other is the linguist from Taiwan who
did the first 40 files.
The Guidelines were again recently revised
to document the replacement of ANON and
UNTNS by ARB and the choice to coindex
whenever possible. These changes are currently
being integrated into &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; files as the files that
already have been coindexed are adjudicated.
A third native speaker from the PRC is inde-
pendently annotating a portion of CTB-I using
this last revision of the Guidelines, and her an-
notations will be compared to the &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; files to
calculate some inter-annotator agreement num-
bers for this last version of the Guidelines.

The CTB-I is a rather limited corpus, both in
size (100K words) and in linguistic structures.
It is very declarative and concrete, and thus the
range of figurative language and &amp;quot;messy&amp;quot; lin-
guistic phenomena is relatively restricted. For
example, there were no examples of object drop
in the CTB-I, although there are examples in
CTB-II.
The expectation is that when a more balanced
corpus is tagged, the Guidelines will need to be
refined with more specific instructions concern-
ing the handling of such things as more complex
plural antecedents, quoted speech, metonymy,
and other figurative expressions.

The goals of the annotation are: to provide training data for learning-based pronoun resolution tools, and to provide a &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; standard to be used in the evaluation of pronoun resolution algorithms. The choices that were made concerning the coindexing of pronominal anaphors and their antecedents are discussed, as are some questions that arose in trying to categorize those pronominal expressions that did to specific nominal entities in the text.</abstract>

In addition, they can refer to nominal entities that are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but that are available through inference. The approach taken to annotation was therefore twofold. The first task was to classify each overt pronoun, demonstrative, and small pro either as a coindexable anaphor that was coreferential with a noun phrase that explicitly appeared in the text, or</context>

For these reasons, a sixth category, labeled UNTNS for untensed, was added to the guidelines in an attempt to capture a meaningful category of dropped subjects. Unfortunately, adding this category caused more problems than it solved. First, it was too hard to clearly define. The reason it was difficult to define is the same reason that the question of a finite vs. non-finite distinction in Chinese is so problematic: there is no reliable diagnostic of (non-)finiteness in Chinese (and, some would argue, no non-finite/finite distinction at all (Hu et al., 2001)). In the absence of diagnostic tests, the Guidelines described the category using sample syntactic structures. Although there are a few syntactic structures such as sentence-initial purpose clauses that appear to be &amp;quot;prototypical&amp;quot; untensed constructions, there are many more structures that require more subjective judgements. Second, even if a diagnostic test for UNTNS were available, there were two basic difficulties with adding the UNTNS category. The first problem was that just as big PRO can be coindexed (e.g., in subject or object control contexts), in a similar way the *pro* in the &amp;quot;unte</context>
