Many people may have the same name which
leads to lots of ambiguities in text, especially for
some common person names. This problem puz-
zles many information retrieval and natural lan-
guage processing tasks. The person name ambi-
guity problem becomes more serious in Chinese
text. Firstly, Chinese names normally consist of
two to four characters. It means that for a two-
character person name, it has only one character
as surname to distinguish from other person
names with the same family name. It leads to
thousands of people have the same common
name, such T-Nil and �H)J. Secondly, some
three-character or four-character person name
may have one two-character person name as its
substring such as T-H)J and T-H)JOI, which leads
to more ambiguities. Thirdly, some Chinese per-
son name string has the sense beyond the person
name. For example, a common Chinese name,
AM has a sense of “Peak”. Thus, the role of a
string as person name or normal word must be
determined. Finally, Chinese text is written in
continuous character strings without word gap. It
leads to the problem that some person names
may be segmented into wrong forms.
In the recent years, there have been many re-
searches on person name disambiguation
(Fleischman and Hovy 2004; Li et al. 2004; Niu
et al. 2004; Bekkerman and McCallum 2005;
Chen and Martin 2007; Song et al. 2009). To
promote the research in this area, Web People
Search (WePS and WePS2) provides a standard
evaluation, which focuses on information extrac-
tion of personal named-entities in Web data (Ar-
tiles et al., 2007; Artiles et al., 2009; Sekine and
Artiles, 2009). Generally speaking, both cluster-

This paper presents the HITSZ_CITYU
system in the CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoff
2010 Task 3, Chinese person name dis-
ambiguation. This system incorporates
person name string recognition, person
identity string recognition and an agglo-
merative hierarchical clustering for
grouping the documents to each identical
person. Firstly, for the given name index
string, three segmentors are applied to
segment the sentences having the index
string into Chinese words, respectively.
Their outputs are compared and analyzed.
An unsupervised clustering is applied
here to help the personal name recogni-
tion. The document set is then divided
into subsets according to each recog-
nized person name string. Next, the sys-
tem identifies/extracts the person identity
string from the sentences based on lex-
icon and heuristic rules. By incorporat-
ing the recognized person identity string,
person name, organization name and
contextual content words as features, an
agglomerative hierarchical clustering is
applied to group the similar documents
in the document subsets to obtain the fi-
nal person name disambiguation results.
Evaluations show that the proposed sys-
tem, which incorporates extraction and
clustering technique, achieves encourag-
ing recall and good overall performance.
based techniques which cluster documents cor-
responding to one person with similar contexts,
global features and document features (Han et al.
2004; Pedersen et al. 2005; Elmacioglu et al.
2007; Pedersen and Anagha 2007; Rao et al.
2007) and information extraction based tech-
niques which recognizes/extracts the description
features of one person name (Heyl and Neumann
2007; Chen et al. 2009) are adopted. Consider-
ing that these evaluations are only applied to
English text, CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 bakeoff pro-
posed the first evaluation campaign on Chinese
person name disambiguation. In this evaluation,
corresponding to given index person name string,
the systems are required to recognize each iden-
tical person having the index string as substring
and classify the document corresponding to each
identical person into a group.
This paper presents the design and implemen-
tation of HITSZ_CITYU system in this bakeoff.
This system incorporates both recogni-
tion/extract technique and clustering technique
for person name disambiguation. It consists of
two major components. Firstly, by incorporating
word segmentation, named entity recognition,
and unsupervised clustering, the system recog-
nize the person name string in the document and
then classify the documents into subsets corres-
ponding to the person name. Secondly, for the
documents having the same person name string,
the system identifies the person identify string,
other person name, organization name and con-
textual context words as features. An agglomera-
tive hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied
to cluster the documents to each identical person.
In this way, the documents corresponding to
each identical person are grouped, i.e. the person
name ambiguities are removed. The evaluation
results show that the HITSZ_CITYU system
achieved 0.8399(B-Cubed)/0.8853(P-IP) preci-
sions and 0.9329(B-Cubed)/0.9578(P-IP) recall,
respectively. The overall F1 performance
0.8742(B-Cubed)/0.915(P-IP) is ranked 2nd in
ten participate teams. These results indicate that
the proposed system incorporating both extrac-
tion and clustering techniques achieves satisfac-
tory recall and overall performance.
The rest of this report is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes and analyzes the task. Sec-
tion 3 presents the word segmentation and per-
son name recognition and Section 4 presents the
person description extraction and document
clustering. Section 5 gives and discusses the
evaluation results. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

26 person name query string, the systems are
required to cluster the documents having the in-
dex string into multiple groups, which each
group representing a separate entity.
HITSZ_CITYU system divided the whole
task into two subtasks:

name in the document. For a given index
string 高峰, in Example 1, 高峰 is a person
name while in Example 2, 高峰 is a noun
meaning “peak” rather than a person name.
Example 1. 谈判专家、北京人民警察学

1.2 Recognize the exact person name, espe-

As discussed in Section 2, HITSZ_CITYU sys-
tem firstly recognizes the person names from the
text including distinguish the person name/ non-
person name word and recognize the different
person name having the name index string. In
our study, we adopted three developed word
segmentation and named entity recognition tools
to generate the person name candidates. The
three tools are:

We apply the three tools to segment and tag
the documents into Chinese words. The recog-
nized person name having the name index string
will be labeled as /nr while the index string is
labeled as discard if it is no recognized as a per-
son name even not a word. For the sentences
having no name index string, we simply vote the
word segmentation results by as the output. As
for the sentences having name index string, we
conduct further analysis on the word segmenta-
tion results.
1. For the cases that the matched string is
recognized as person name and non-
person name by different systems, respec-
tively, we selected the recognized person
name as the output. For example, in
Example 6. 卫生福利及食物局局长杨
永强赞扬谢婉雯工作尽心尽力 (Secre-
tary for Health, Welfare and Food, Yang
Yongqiang commended the excellent work
of Tse Wanwen).
the segmentation results by three segmen-
tors are 杨永强/nr |discarded|杨永强/nr,
respectively. We select 杨永强/nr as the
output.
2. For the cases that three systems generate
different person names, we further incor-
porating unsupervised clustering results
for determination. Here, an agglomerative
hierarchical clustering with high threshold
is applied (the details of clustering will be
presented in Section 4).
Example 7. 朱 芳 勇 闯 三 关 (Zhufang
overcome three barriers)
In this example, the word segmentation
results are 朱芳/nr, 朱芳勇/nr, 朱芳勇
/nr, respectively. It is shown that there is
a segmentation ambiguity here because
both 朱芳 and 朱芳勇 are legal Chinese
person names. Such kinds of ambiguity
cannot be solved by segmentors indivi-
dually. We further consider the clustering
results. Since the Example 7 is clustered
with the documents having the segmenta-
tion results of 朱芳, two votes (emphasize
the clustering confidence) for 朱芳 are as-
signed. Thus, 朱芳 and 朱芳勇 obtained 3
votes and 2 votes in this case, respectively,
and thus 朱芳 is selected as the output.
3. For cases that the different person name
forms having the same votes, the longer
person name is selected. In the following
example,

The segmentation form of 张民 and 张民
选 received the same votes, thus, the
longer one 张民选 is selected as the out-
put.
In this component, we applied three segmen-
tors (normally using the local features only) with
the help of clustering to (using both the local and
global features) recognize person name in the
text with high accuracy. It is important to ensure
the recall performance of the final output. Noted,
in order to ensure the high precision of cluster-
ing, we set a high similarity threshold here.

4.1 Person Identity Recognition/Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999625090909091">
A person is distinguished by its associated
attributes in which its identity description is es-
sential. For example, a person name has the
identity of 总统 president and 农民 farmer, re-
spectively, tends to be two different persons.
Therefore, in HITSZ_CITYU system, the person
identity is extracted based on lexicon and heuris-
tic rules before person name disambiguation.
We have an entity lexicon consisting of 85
suffixes and 248 prefix descriptor for persons as
the initial lexicon. We further expand this lex-
icon through extracting frequently used entity
words from Gigaword. Here, we segmented
documents in Gigaword into word sequences.
For each identified person name, we collect its
neighboring nouns. The associations between the
nouns and person name can be estimated by their
χ2 test value. For a candidate entity wa and per-
son name wb, (here, wb is corresponding to per-
son name class with the label /nr), the following
2-by-2 table shown the dependence of their oc-
currence.

where, N is the total number of words in the
corpus. The nouns having the χ2 value greater
than a threshold are extracted as entity descrip-
tors.
In person entity extraction subtask, for each
sentence has the recognized person name, the
system matches its neighboring nouns (-2 to +2
words surrounding the person name) with the
entries in entity descriptor lexicon. The matched
entity descriptors are extracted.
In this part, several heuristic rules are applied
to handle some non-neighboring cases. Two ex-
ample rules with cases are given below.
Example Rule 1. The prefix entity descriptor
will be assigned to parallel person names with
the split mark of “/” , “、”and “和”,“与”(and).

Furthermore, the HITSZ_CITYU system ap-

4.2 Clustering-based Person Name Disam-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99875135">
For the document set corresponding to each giv-
en index person name, we firstly split the docu-
ment set into: (1) Discarded subset, (2) Subset
with different recognized person name. The sub-
sets are further split into (2-1) the person is the
author/reporter and (2-2) the person is not the
author/reporter. The clustering techniques are
then applied to group documents in each (2-2)
subset into several clusters which each cluster is
corresponding to each identical person.
In the Chinese Person Name Disambiguation
task, the number of clusters contained in a subset
is not pre-available. Thus, the clustering method
which fixes the number of clusters, such as k-
nearest neighbor (k-NN) is not applicable. Con-
sidering that Agglomerative Hierarchical Clus-
tering (AHC) algorithm doesn’t require the fixed
number of cluster and it performs well in docu-
ment categorization (Jain and Dubes 1988), it is
adopted in HITSZ_CITYU system.

Preprocessing and Document Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998426736842105">
Before representing documents, a series of pro-
cedures are adopted to preprocess these docu-
ments including stop word removal. Next, we
select feature words for document clustering.
Generally, paragraphs containing the target per-
son name usually contain more person-related
information, such as descriptor, occupation, af-
filiation, and partners. Therefore, larger weights
should be assigned to these words. Furthermore,
we further consider the appearance position of
the features. Intuitively, local feature words with
small distance are more important than the glob-
al features words with longer distance.
We implemented some experiments on the
training data to verify our point. Table 2 and Ta-
ble 3 show the clustering performance achieved
using different combination of global features
and local features as well as different similarity
thresholds.

In this two tables, “Paragraph” means that we
only select words containing in paragraph which

We evaluated the AHC algorithm with the
above three link methods. The achieved perfor-
mance are given in Table 4. It is shown that the
system performs best with the complete link me-
thod. Therefore, the complete link method is
selected for the bakeoff testing.
The evaluation results show that the
HITSZ_CITYU system achieved overall F1 per-
formance of 0.8742(B-Cubed)/ 0.915(P-IP), re-
spectively.
It is also shown that HITSZ CITYU achieves
the highest the recall performance. It shows that
the proposed system is good at split the docu-
ment to different identical persons. Meanwhile,
this system should improve the capacity on
merge small clusters to enhance the precision
and overall performance.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917">
The presented HITSZ_CITYU system applies
multi-segmentor and unsupervised clustering to
achieve good accuracy on person name string
recognition. The system then incorporates entity
descriptor extraction, feature word extraction
and agglomerative hierarchical clustering me-
thod for person name disambiguation. The
achieved encouraging performance shown the
high performance word segmentation/name rec-
ognition and extraction-based technique are
helpful to improve the cluster-based person
name disambiguation.

The clustering techniques are then applied to group documents in each (2-2) subset into several clusters which each cluster is corresponding to each identical person. In the Chinese Person Name Disambiguation task, the number of clusters contained in a subset is not pre-available. Thus, the clustering method which fixes the number of clusters, such as knearest neighbor (k-NN) is not applicable. Considering that Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm doesn’t require the fixed number of cluster and it performs well in document categorization (Jain and Dubes 1988), it is adopted in HITSZ_CITYU system. Preprocessing and Document Representation Before representing documents, a series of procedures are adopted to preprocess these documents including stop word removal. Next, we select feature words for document clustering. Generally, paragraphs containing the target person name usually contain more person-related information, such as descriptor, occupation, affiliation, and partners. Therefore, larger weights should be assigned to these words. Furthermore, we further consider the appearance position of the features. Intuitively, local feature words with sm</context>

It leads to the problem that some person names may be segmented into wrong forms. In the recent years, there have been many researches on person name disambiguation (Fleischman and Hovy 2004; Li et al. 2004; Niu et al. 2004; Bekkerman and McCallum 2005; Chen and Martin 2007; Song et al. 2009). To promote the research in this area, Web People Search (WePS and WePS2) provides a standard evaluation, which focuses on information extraction of personal named-entities in Web data (Artiles et al., 2007; Artiles et al., 2009; Sekine and Artiles, 2009). Generally speaking, both clusterAbstract This paper presents the HITSZ_CITYU system in the CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoff 2010 Task 3, Chinese person name disambiguation. This system incorporates person name string recognition, person identity string recognition and an agglomerative hierarchical clustering for grouping the documents to each identical person. Firstly, for the given name index string, three segmentors are applied to segment the sentences having the index string into Chinese words, respectively. Their outputs are compared and analyzed. An unsupervised clustering is applied here to help th</context>

Thirdly, some Chinese person name string has the sense beyond the person name. For example, a common Chinese name, AM has a sense of “Peak”. Thus, the role of a string as person name or normal word must be determined. Finally, Chinese text is written in continuous character strings without word gap. It leads to the problem that some person names may be segmented into wrong forms.
