Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999863647058824">
Scott and Souza (1990) have posed the problem
of how a rhetorical structure (in which proposi-
tions are linked by rhetorical relations, but not
yet arranged in a linear order) can be realized
by a text structure (in which propositions are
ordered and linked up by appropriate discourse
connectives). Almost all work on this problem
assumes, implicitly or explicitly, that this map-
ping is governed by a constraint on compatibil-
ity of structure. We show how this constraint
can be stated precisely, and present some coun-
terexamples which seem acceptable even though
they violate compatibility. The examples are
based on a phenomenon we call extraposztion,
in which complex embedded constituents of a
rhetorical structure are extracted and realized
separately.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516492063492">
Text planning (or more broadly, document plan-
ning) can be divided into two stages. In the
first stage, material is selected, perhaps from a
knowledge base, and organized rhetorically. In
the second stage, the rhetorical structure is re-
alized by a text structure (or document struc-
ture), through which the material is distributed
among sentences. paragraphs, vertical lists, and
perhaps even diagrams. The RAGS (1999) pro-
posal for a standard 1\TLC architecture distin-
guishes the outputs of these two phases by the
data types RhetRep (rhetorical representation)
and DocRep (document representation),
We focus in this paper on the, second stage,
of text planning the passage from RhetRep
to DocRep. NLG researchers have addressed
this issue in various ways, but everyone as-
sumes some kind of structural compatibility be-
tween rhetorical structure and text structure.
The most popular discourse framework in NLG
is R.ST (Mann and Thompson. 1988). which
makes the crucial distinction between nucleus,
which is the most important part of a message,
and satellite, which is the peripheral part of the
message. Scott and Souza (1990) provide guide-
lines for the realisation of RST trees into a co-
herent text. One of them is to avoid dangling
sentences, that is, to avoid putting &amp;quot;information
that is only weakly relevant to the message&amp;quot; in
a separate sentence because it will feel as if it
has been introduced as an afterthought or as
introducing a new topic which is then abruptly
abandoned, disrupting the comprehensibility of
the text. As an example, the authors provide
the attributive satellite of an elaboration rela-
tion.
Marcu (1996), in order to build a valid text
plan from a set of rhetorical assertions, uses
the &amp;quot;nuclearity principle&amp;quot;, that is the observa-
tion in Mann and Thompson&apos;s framework that
&amp;quot;whenever two large text spans are connected
through a rhetorical relation, that rhetorical re-
lation holds also between the most important
parts of the constituent spans&amp;quot;. Therefore, the
resulting text plans are valid in the sense that
they are isomorphic with one of the rhetorical
structures that can be built from the rhetorical
assertions using this nuclearity principle.
Our aim in this paper is to formulate inure
precisely a notion of structural compatibility
which is necessary in order to describe the real-
isation of a RhetRep into various DocReps, and
then to discuss some examples (mostly taken
from the domain of patient information leaflets)
of apparently acceptable texts in which this no-
tion of . compatibility is violated. To discuss
this issue clearly, an assumption must be made
about the kinds of information represented by
rhetorical and text structure; we outline in sec-
tion 2 the common assumption that these rep-
resentations are trees, labelled respectively with
rhetorical and textual categories, the rhetorical
structure being unordered and the text struc-

ture ordered. Section 3 then defines a notion
of structural compatibility that is weaker than
isomorphism; section 4 shows that we can find
plausible counterexamples even to this weaker
formulation, and discusses why these passages
occur. Section 5 discusses some implications for
NLG, and finally, section 6 raises further impor-
tant issues.
2 Rhetorical structure and
text structure
To distinguish clearly between RhetRep and
DocRep, we need to define the kinds of infor-
mation that should be included in the two rep-
resentations. Bateman and Rondhius (1997)
compare several approaches to rhetorical rep-
resentation, citing in particular RST (Mann
and Thompson, 1988) and Segmented Discourse
Representation Theory (Asher, 1993), These
approaches share the idea that rhetorical repre-
sentations are composed of propositions linked
by rhetorical relations; SDRT includes as well
the logical apparatus of DRT, thus covering
notions like necessity and logical scope which
are missing from RST. For the most part,
NLG applications have used the RST frame-
work, adapted in various ways; the most com-
mon representation, proposed also as the RAGS
standard, is that of a tree in which terminal
nodes represent elementary propositions, while
non-terminal nodes represent rhetorical rela-
tionships. This representation, proposed for ex-
ample by Scott and Souza (1990), is illustrated
by figure 1, which might be realized by the fol-
lowing passage:
(1) Elixir occasionally provokes a mild allergic
reaction&apos;, because it contains gestodenee.
However, Elixir has no serious side-
effeets.4.
Assuming an RST-based framework, an im-
portant issue is whether the rhetorical represen-
tation should already.imply a linear order. Most
researchers have followed Scott and Souza in as-
suming that linear order should be left unspeci-
fied;.it is during the transition to the document
representation that the material is distributed
among linguistic units (or perhaps diagrams, in
a multimedia document) arranged in a specific
order. Thus the cause relation in figure 1. for
example, could be realized with nucleus first, or
satellite first, or satellite embedded within nu-
(&apos;leus:

In the RAGS proposal, which aims to extract
a useful common approach from current work
in NLG, the DocRep comprises an ordered tree
corresponding roughly to the &apos;logical markup&apos;
in notations like HTML and LaTeX. More pre-
cisely, a distinction is made between abstract
and concrete levels of representation, where the
abstract representation corresponds to logical
markup (e.g., concepts like &apos;paragraph&apos; and &apos;em-
phasis&apos;), while the concrete representation also
covers graphical markup (concepts like &apos;vertical
space&apos; and &apos;bold face&apos;). In terms of this dis-
tinction, it is the AbsDocRep that is specified
during text planning; graphical markup can be
deferred to a later formatting stage.

3 Structural compatibility
Summarising the argument so far, we have made
three main points:
O Rhetorical structure has typically been
represented by unordered RST trees such
as figure 1.
• Document structure, which conveys in-
formation similar to logical markup in
HTML, can he represented by ordered
trees in which nodes are labelled with text-
categories (figure 2).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.611569666666667">
constituents of text-clauses, sometimes separated by
commas, although within text-causes the hierarchi-
cal structure is expressed mainly through syntax.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996413571428571">
O A given rhetorical representation can be
expressed by a variety of different docu-
ment representations, in which the propo-
sitions occur in different orders, and in
different text-category configurations, and
the rhetorical relations are expressed by
different connectives.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9930865">
This formulation of the problem raises an obvi-
ous question: how can we characterize the set of
document representations that adequately real-
ize a given rhetorical representation? Elsewhere
(Power, 2000), we have argued that an adequate
realization must meet three conditions:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.82695">
Correct content:

<bodyText confidence="0.9968325">

<bodyText confidence="0.953058">
The first two conditions are relatively straight-
forward, but what is meant -exactly by &apos;struc-
tural compatibility&apos;? •
Assuming that we are comparing two trees,
the strongest notion of compatibility is isomor-
phism, which can be defined for our purposes as
follows:
DocRep is isomorphic with RhetRep
if they group the elementary propo-
sitions in exactly the same way.
More formally, every set of proposi-
tions that is dominated by a node in
DocRep should be dominated by a node
in RhetRep, and vice-versa.
Under this definition, the rhetorical representa-
tion in figure 1 is isomorphic with the document
representation in figure 2a, but not with that in
figure 2b:
O Proceeding top-down and left-to-right, the
five nodes in figure 1 dominate the proposi-
tion sets {A, B, C}, {A}, {B, C}, {B}, and
{C).

nectives, the nodes in figure 2a dominate
the proposition sets {A, B, C}, {B,C},
{B}, {C} (twice), and {A} (twice). These
are exactly the same sets that were ob-
tained for figure 1.
o The corresponding sets for figure 2b are
{A, B, C}, {C}, {B} (twice), and {A}
(twice). Since the set { B , CI is missing
from this list, there is a grouping in figure
1 that is not realized in figure 2b, so these
representations are not isomorphic.
Since structures like figure 2b are common, iso-
morphism seems too strong a constraint; we
have therefore proposed (Power, 2000) the fol-
lowing weaker notion of compatibility:
DocRep is compatible with RhetRep
if every grouping of the elementary
propositions in DocRep is also found
in RhetRep.
Formally, every set of propositions
that is dominated by a node in DocRep
should be dominated by a node in
RhetRep but the converse is not re-
quired.
Under this constraint. we allow the document
representation to omit rhetorical groupings. but

The compatibility rule may be a useful text-
planning heuristic, but as a constraint on ade-
quacy it still seems too strong. Looking through
our corpus of patient information leaflets, we
have noticed some exceptions, especially in pas-
sages giving conditional instructions:
(4) If you forget to take your tablet, take an-
other as soon as you remembers or wait
until it is time to take your next dosec.
Then go on as befores.
From the point of view of document structure.
this passage is a paragraph comprising two text-
sentences: thus the proposition D is separated
from the other three propositions, which are
grouped in the .first sentence. However, rhetor-
ically speaking, D belongs to the consequent of
the conditional: it is the final step of the plan
that should be activated if. the patient forgets
to take a dose (figure 3). Compatibility is vio-
lated because the DocRep contains a node (the
first text-sentence) dominating the proposition
set {A, B, C), which is not dominated by any
node in figure 3.
Such examples might be explained as the re-
sult of loose punctuation or layout, perhaps

as an afterthought. Thus proposition D remains
grouped with B and C — they occur consecu-
tively — but through a minor relaxation of nor-
mal punctuation it has been separated by a full-
stop rather than a comma. However, this expla-
nation fails to cover variations of the example
in which the propositions in the consequent are
not realized consecutively in the DocRep:
(5) Consult your doctor immediatelyA if a
rash developss. It might become seriously
infectedc
In this example, A must be grouped rhetori-
cally with C rather than with B, unless we take
the radical step of allowing rhetorical structure
to contradict logical structure. The proposition
C cannot be logically conjoined with the con-
ditional because it contains a hypothetical dis-
course referent (the rash) that is bound to the
antecedent, and is therefore inaccessible outside
the conditional.
If passages of this kind are not artifacts of
loose punctuation, why do they occur? A plau-
sible reason, we suggest, is that some com-
plex rhetorical patterns cannot easily be real-
ized in a way that maintains structural com-
patibility, usually because text-clauses are over-
loaded. Conditionals are especially prone to this
problem because the only common discourse
connective (if&apos;) is a subordinating conjunction
which can only link spans within a syntactic
sentence (and thus within a text-clause). If ei-
ther the antecedent or the consequent is com-
plex, the author is faced with a tricky problem.
We have found examples in patient informa-
tion leaflets of conditional sentences so long that
they are almost incomprehensible. More skilled
authors, however, succeed in presenting the ma-
terial clearly either by using layout (e.g., a com-
plex antecedent is presented as an indented list),
or by a trick of rhetorical reorganization that we
will call extraposition. It is this trick that intro-
duces an incompatibility between RhetRep and
DocRep.
Extraposition typically occurs when a rhetor-
ical representation R contains a complex em-
bedded constituent C. To respect structural
compatibility, R should be realized by a doc-
ument unit that contains the realization of C:
instead, in extraposition, a document unit real-
king I? – C is cc muted with one realizing C.
so that. the extraposed material C is raised in
the DocRep to the same level as R. To recon-
....struct meaning of --the passage, -the
reader has to plug C back into R. In most
cases, the author facilitates this task through
an explicit deictic reference to the extraposed
material (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2000):

difficulty in breathing
....,-.ahdominal pains
nausea or vomiting
Occasionally, however, the author leaves the
extraposition implicit, assuming that the reader
can infer the correct location of C within R from
the propositional content. In such cases, the ex-
traposition looks like an afterthought, because
the unit realizing R– C contains no signal that
a gap in its content will be filled in later.
We have also come across rare examples
of another kind of incompatibility in which
Marcu&apos;s (1996) principle of nuclearity is vio-
lated by grouping together two satellites which
have the same nucleus. Suppose that the rhetor-
ical representation in figure 1 is realized by the
following passage, in a context in which the
reader knows nothing about gestodene:
(7) Although Elixir has no serious side-
effects A , it contains gestodenec Conse-
quently, it occasionally provokes a mild al-
lergic reactionB.
The apparent concession relation between A
and C here is paradoxical, since in rhetorical
structure they are unrelated. Of course a con-
trast between A and C might be perceived by
a medical expert; however, one can construct
similar examples in which the apparent relation
is even less plausible:
(8a) Although we usually work from nine to
fiveA, today is Fridayc. Consequently, we
can go horne early n.
This may be rather loose, but many people find
it acceptable. It could be explained as a rhetor-
ical trick in which the sheer paradox of the con-
cession serves as a signal that it is incomplete.
The device might be spelled out as follows:
Although Elixir has no serious side-
effects.1 there exists a contmsting
state of affairs resulting froni. the fact
that it contains gestodene(.. This
state of affairs is that it occasionally
provokes a mild allergic reaction8.

<bodyText confidence="0.999770444444445">
Unlike the conditional examples above, this de-
vice works only when the rhetorically grouped
propositions B and C are consecutive in the
DocRep. Thus whatever view is taken of exam-
ple (8a) , everyone finds its variant (8b) much
worse:
(8b) # Today is Fridayc although we usually
work from nine to fiveA. Consequently, we
can go home early8.

5 Implications for NLG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99696725">
For many NLG applications, the notion of com-
patibility defined above is a useful hard con-
straint; even if violations of this constraint are
sometimes acceptable, they are not essential.
However, for some kinds of material (e.g., com-
plex instructions), extraposition is a convenient
rhetorical device which might improve the read-
ability of the generated texts, so it is worth con-
sidering how a text planner might be configured
so as to allow solutions that violate compatibil-
ity.
In terms of the RAGS framework, there
are broadly two possible approaches. First,
we could introduce incompatibility by defin-
ing transformations on the RhetRep; alterna-
tively, we could relax the constraints govern-
ing the transition from RhetRep to DocRep.
The RAGS proposal (1999) allows for rhetorical
transformations through a distinction between
abstract and concrete rhetorical representa-
tions. The abstract representation AbsRhetRep
expresses the rhetorical content of the under-
lying message, while the concrete RhetRep ex-
presses the rhetorical structure directly realized
in the text and corresponds to the representa-
tion used by Scott and Souza (1990) to discuss
textual realisation. If RhetRep is incompati-
ble with AbsRhetRep, the text structure DocRep
will also be incompatible with AbsRhetRep,
even though the rules for realizing rhetorical
structure by document structure are themselves
compatibility-preserving. Transformation oper-
ations are also used by Marcu (2000) to map
Japanese rhetorical structures onto English-like
rhetorical structures, but these ace mappings
between two RhetReps rather than from an
AbsRhetRep to a RhetRep_
If transformations are allowed, there are obvi-
ous dangers that the message will be expressed
in such a distorted way that, the reader cannot
recover the original intention. For this rmson,
rhetorical transformations must he defined with
care. A fairly safe option would appear to be
-the .extraposition -of .a .proposition elaborating
the antecedent of a. conditional even though
such a transformation would violate Marcu&apos;s
(1996) nuclearity principle&apos; (assuming that the
antecedent is regarded as the satellite). The fol-
lowing examples show that this transformation
leads to acceptable texts regardless of the order
of nucleus and satellite within the conditional:
- . (9a)- Do not use Elixir if you -have had an
lergic reaction to Elixir. An allergic reac-
tion may be recognised as a rash, itching
or shortness of breath.
(9b) If you have had an allergic reaction to
Elixir, do not use Elixir. An allergic re-
action may be recognised as a rash, itching
or shortness or breath.
However, the approach based on rhetorical
transformations leads to difficulties when the
acceptability of the resulting text depends on
linear order as well as grouping. For instance,
suppose that we try extraposing the elabora-
tion of a satellite when the main relation is not
a conditional, but a concession. The following
passages show two texts that might result, but
in this case the second version sounds anoma-
lous: even if they are not grouped together in
the DocRep, the satellite and its elaboration at
least need to be consecutive.
(10a) You should not stop taking Elixir, even
though you might experience some mild
effects. For example, feelings of dizziness
and nausea are very common at the begin-
ning of treatment.
(1%) # Even though you might experience some
mild effects at the beginning of the treat-
ment. you should not stop taking Elixir.
For example, feelings of dizziness and nau-
sea are very common at the beginning of
treat ment.
A transformation from AbsRhetRep to
RhetRep cannot distinguish these cases, so that
.10a isallowed while 10b is prohibited, unless the
RhetRep is at least partially specified for linear
order, Adhering strictly to the RAGS frame-
work, where linear order is specified only in
AbsDoeftep, one would have to adopt the alter-
native of building an incompatible AbsDocRep
from RhetRep. constraining the linear order at.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991731707317">
We have discussed various examples of extra-
position. This phenomenon is due to various
factors: the complexity of the material (exam-
ple 4), the presence of logical information (5),
the use of referring expressions to access infor-
mation at various degrees of accessibility in the
text structure (5,6,9), and the use of particular
rhetorical strategies (7,8). This last group of ex-
amples concerns .a concession construction sim-
ilar to the one discussed by Grote et al. (1997),
namely the substitution concession. This type
of concession groups together the conceded part
A and the explanation C but leaves the conclu-
sion B unverbalised_ The difference in the case
of examples 7 and 8 is that A and C are grouped
together but B is required to follow them be-
cause there is not enough information for the
reader to infer B from A and C.
The extraposition phenomenon shows that
the nucleus-satellite distinction is not the only
factor influencing the segmentation of the mes-
sage. In example 10, the injunction you should
not stop taking Elixir obviously expresses the
main intention of the author. However, the
fact that the subordinated concession is placed
after its main clause makes it available for
further expansion. The sometimes compet-
ing informational and intentional roles of dis-
course segments have been at the centre of
the debate over the nucleus-satellite distinction
(Moore and Pollack, 1992; Moser and Moore,
1996; Bateman and Rondhius, 1997); the acces-
sibility of discourse segments on the right fron-
tier of a discourse structure is a phenomenon
that has already been discussed by several re-
searchers (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993). Extra-
position provides a useful and sometimes im-
portant means of rearranging complex material
in an abstract discourse representation in order
to satisfy the constraints posed by lincarisation
into text.

<abstract confidence="0.996491666666667">and (1990) have posed the problem of how a rhetorical structure (in which propositions are linked by rhetorical relations, but not yet arranged in a linear order) can be realized by a text structure (in which propositions are ordered and linked up by appropriate discourse connectives). Almost all work on this problem assumes, implicitly or explicitly, that this mapping is governed by a constraint on compatibility of structure. We show how this constraint can be stated precisely, and present some counterexamples which seem acceptable even though they violate compatibility. The examples are on a phenomenon we call in which complex embedded constituents of a rhetorical structure are extracted and realized separately.</abstract>

This phenomenon is due to various factors: the complexity of the material (example 4), the presence of logical information (5), the use of referring expressions to access information at various degrees of accessibility in the text structure (5,6,9), and the use of particular rhetorical strategies (7,8). This last group of examples concerns .a concession construction similar to the one discussed by Grote et al. (1997), namely the substitution concession. This type of concession groups together the conceded part A and the explanation C but leaves the conclusion B unverbalised_ The difference in the case of examples 7 and 8 is that A and C are grouped together but B is required to follow them because there is not enough information for the reader to infer B from A and C. The extraposition phenomenon shows that the nucleus-satellite distinction is not the only factor influencing the segmentation of the message.

Scott and Souza (1990) provide guidelines for the realisation of RST trees into a coherent text. One of them is to avoid dangling sentences, that is, to avoid putting &amp;quot;information that is only weakly relevant to the message&amp;quot; in a separate sentence because it will feel as if it has been introduced as an afterthought or as introducing a new topic which is then abruptly abandoned, disrupting the comprehensibility of the text. As an example, the authors provide the attributive satellite of an elaboration relation. Marcu (1996), in order to build a valid text plan from a set of rhetorical assertions, uses the &amp;quot;nuclearity principle&amp;quot;, that is the observation in Mann and Thompson&apos;s framework that &amp;quot;whenever two large text spans are connected through a rhetorical relation, that rhetorical relation holds also between the most important parts of the constituent spans&amp;quot;. Therefore, the resulting text plans are valid in the sense that they are isomorphic with one of the rhetorical structures that can be built from the rhetorical assertions using this nuclearity principle.

O A given rhetorical representation can be expressed by a variety of different document representations, in which the propositions occur in different orders, and in different text-category configurations, and the rhetorical relations are expressed by different connectives. This formulation of the problem raises an obvious question: how can we characterize the set of document representations that adequately realize a given rhetorical representation? Elsewhere (Power, 2000), we have argued that an adequate realization must meet three conditions: Correct content: All propositions and rhetorical relations must be expressed. Well-formed structure: General formation rules for document structure must be respected (e.g. a textsentence •cannot • contain a paragraph, unless the paragraph is indented). Structural compatibility: The document representation must organize the propositions in a way that is compatible with their organization in rhetorical structure. 196 The first two conditions are relatively straightforward, but what is meant -exactly by &apos;structural compatib</context>

Since the set { B , CI is missing from this list, there is a grouping in figure 1 that is not realized in figure 2b, so these representations are not isomorphic. Since structures like figure 2b are common, isomorphism seems too strong a constraint; we have therefore proposed (Power, 2000) the following weaker notion of compatibility: DocRep is compatible with RhetRep if every grouping of the elementary propositions in DocRep is also found in RhetRep. Formally, every set of propositions that is dominated by a node in DocRep should be dominated by a node in RhetRep but the converse is not required.

The examples are based on a phenomenon we call extraposztion, in which complex embedded constituents of a rhetorical structure are extracted and realized separately. 1 Introduction Text planning (or more broadly, document planning) can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, material is selected, perhaps from a knowledge base, and organized rhetorically. In the second stage, the rhetorical structure is realized by a text structure (or document structure), through which the material is distributed among sentences. paragraphs, vertical lists, and perhaps even diagrams. The RAGS (1999) proposal for a standard 1\TLC architecture distinguishes the outputs of these two phases by the data types RhetRep (rhetorical representation) and DocRep (document representation), We focus in this paper on the, second stage, of text planning the passage from RhetRep to DocRep. NLG researchers have addressed this issue in various ways, but everyone assumes some kind of structural compatibility between rhetorical structure and text structure. The most popular discourse framework in NLG is R.ST (Mann and Thompson. 1988). which makes the crucial distinction between nucleus, which is the most imp</context>
