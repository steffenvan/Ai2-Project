Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999941875">
We propose a semantics for locative expressions
such as near Jones or west of Denver, an impor-
tant subsystem for NLP applications. Locative ex-
pressions denote regions of space, and serve as argu-
ments to predicates, locating objects and events spa-
tially. Since simple locatives occupy argument posi-
tions, they do NOT participate in scope ambiguities—
pace one common view, which sees locatives as logical
operators. Our proposal justifies common representa-
tional practice in computational linguistics, account-
ing for how locative expressions function anaphori-
cally, and explaining a wide range of inference in-
volving locatives. We further demonstrate how the
argument analysis may accommodate multiple loca-
tive arguments in a single predicate. The analysis is
implemented for use in a database query application.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999315608695652">
Locative expressions take diverse forms: in New
York, here, there, nowhere, and on a boat he has
in Ohio. They combine with common nouns (city
on the Rhine), or with verbs or verb-phrases (work
in Boston), always locating objects and situations in
space. Some temporal expressions are similar, but we
focus here on spatial locatives.
The analysis was developed for use in an NLP sys-
tem producing database queries; it is fully imple-
mented and has been in frequent (developmental) use
for 18 months. It is important to provide facilities
for reasoning about location in database query ap-
plications because users typically do not query loca-
tive information in the exact form it appears in the
database. A database may e.g. contain the infor-
mation that a painting is in the Guggenheim Mu-
seum, perhaps even that it&apos;s in the Guggenheim in
New York, and yet be helpless when queried whether
that same painting is in the US. In our implementa-
tion information about location is represented using
the logical analysis provided here.&apos;
10f course, the information that New York is in the US must
be provided by a compatible geographical knowledge base.

1.1 Sketch of Proposal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990829268293">
The provides general service: first, in collecting the
data relevant to a semantic analysis of locatives; sec-
ond, in presenting the proposal in a fashion which ap-
plies to other natural languages and other logical rep-
resentations; and third, in noting the consequences
of our proposal for the organization of NLP systems,
specifically the cooperation of syntax and semantics.
The behavior of locatives in inference and anaphora
reflects their semantics. This behavior justifies the
hypothesis that (unquantified) locatives refer to re-
gions, while related sequences of locatives refer to
the intersection of the regions associated with their
components. E.g. the phrase (sequence) in Canada
on the Atlantic Coast refers to the (maximal) region
which is both in Canada and on the Atlantic Coast.
Locative adverbials within a verb phrase will then
be seen to contribute to a location argument in pred-
icates which identifies an area within which the pred-
icate is asserted to hold. The view that locatives
occupy an ARGUMENT position within a predication
is contrasted with the view that they are EXTER-
NAL OPERATORS (cf. Cresswell [7]), Or MODIFIERS on
predications (cf. Davidson [8] or Sondheimer [181).
In fact, however, the analysis of locative phrases as
arguments jibes well with the practice of most com-
putational linguists; cf. Allen [1], pp.198-207 and the
references there, [1], p.218. The present effort con-
tributes to the justification and explication of this
practice.
Our approach is closest to Jackendoff [12]. We
follow Jackendoff first, in suggesting that locative
phrases are referential in the same way that noun
phrases (NPs) are; and second, in taking locative ad-
verbials to function as arguments. But there is a sig-
nificant foundational problem implicit in the hypoth-
esis that locatives are arguments: locatives, unlike
standard arguments in the predicate calculus, appear
optionally and multiply. Predicate logic does not ac-
commodate the occurrence of multiple arguments in
a single argument position. We solve this techni-
cal problem by allowing that multiple locatives CON-

STRAIN a single argument within a predication. This
effectively challenges a standard assumption about
the syntax-semantics interface, viz, how syntactic el-
ements map into arguments, but leads to an elegant
semantics.
In addition to the adverbial use of locatives, we
recognize a predicative use illustrated by (1). We
return to these in Section 6 below.

2 The Logic of Locatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.766597133333333">
In this section we collect valid and invalid argument-
patterns involving adverbial locatives. A semantics of
locatives should explain the entailments we catalog
here. We restrict our attention initially to locative
phrases in which locations are specified with respect
to logical individuals (denoted by proper names, e.g.
&apos;Boston&apos;, &apos;Jones&apos;, or &apos;Mass Ave&apos;) because we assume
that their analysis is relatively uncontroversia1.2 We
begin by noting that any number of locatives may
adjoin to almost any verb (phrase);
(2) Tom works on Mass Ave. in Boston near MIT.
A natural question to ask, then, concerns the logical
relation between complex clauses like (2) and simpler
clauses eliminating one or more of its locatives. To
begin, the SIMPLIFYING INFERENCE in (3) is valid:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.269018333333333">
Al works in Boston.
(3) • Al works.
Using multiple adjuncts doesn&apos;t disturb this pattern
of inference, as (4) and (5) illustrate:
Al works on Mass Ave. in Boston.
• Al works in Boston.
</table>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.855838">

<bodyText confidence="0.8956417">
(5) Al works on Mass Ave.
PERMUTING locative adjuncts has no effect on
truth conditions. Thus the sentences in (6) are truth-
conditionally equivalent. Some are less felicitous than
others, and they may manipulate discourse context
differently, but they all describe the same facts:
2We don&apos;t think it matters whether the proper names are
taken to be individual constants, as they normally are, or
whether they are analyzed as restricted parameters, as situ-
ation semantics ([3],pp.165-68) has suggested.

Even though the simplifying inference in (3) is
valid, we must take care, since the complementary

Al works in NY and in Boston.
Finally, there is what we call the UPWARD MONO-
TONICITY of locatives. If a sentence locating some-
thing at a region R is true, and if R is contained in
the region R&apos;, then a sentence locating that thing at
R&apos; is true:
Al works in New York.

Notice in (10) that the locative phrases are specified
with respect not to locations, but to other logical
individuals. This is accomplished by the semantics
of the prepositions under and in; our proposal will
require that locative PHRASES refer to regions, but
not that their subcomponents must.

3 Other Semantic Evidence
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987362">
3.1 Scope
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.921393333333333">
Locatives by themselves do NOT induce scope am-
biguity with respect to negation, thus the semantic
nonambiguity of (11); compare that with (12).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.973284">
(11) Tina didn&apos;t work in New York.
(12) Tina didn&apos;t drink because of her husband.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.999213">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.757395285714286">
The causal adjunct because of DOES induce a scope
ambiguity with respect to negation. That is why (12)
has two readings, one (narrow scope negation) on
which Tina&apos;s not drinking is in some way due to her
husband, another (wide-scope negation) which denies
that Tina&apos;s drinking is because of her husband. (11)
shows no analogous scope ambiguity. Thus, locatives
appear to behave differently from at least some other
adjuncts in that they no show no scope variation with
respect to negation.
The simplest explanation of this failure to induce
scope ambiguity is to deny that simple locatives have
scope, i.e. to deny that they are logical operators or
external modifiers. We propose exactly this when we
postulate that they are arguments rather than op-
erators. We grant that locatives in sentence-initial
position DO display properties which suggest scope,
but this needn&apos;t vitiate the argument analysis.3
Note that the &amp;quot;commutativity of locatives&amp;quot; shown
in (6) is another indication of failure to scope: loca-
tives fail to scope with respect to each other.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985588">
3.1.1 Scope versus Focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979067416666667">
In evaluating the claim that no SCOPE AMBIGUITY is
possible in (11), it is important not to be confused by
the possibility of interpreting the FOCUS of negation
in various ways. The association of negation with
a focused element is a well-discussed, if not not a
well-understood, phenomenon in the literature (see
Jackendoff ([11], pp.229-78), Chotnsky ([41, pp.199-
208), and Rooth [17] for discussions of focus). The
crucial point about focus is that it affects arguments
and adjuncts alike, and that ambiguities involving the
association of negation with focus affect both. For
example,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.604622">
(13) Elizabeth Browning didn&apos;t adore Robert.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996133333333333">
The focus can be either on adore or on Robert, giving
different presuppositions,4 even though the proper
name Robert is never analyzed as scope-inducing.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999382">
3.2 Preposed Locatives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994667">
PREPOSED locatives do show properties that resemble
scope. Cf. Thomason and Stalnaker ([21], p.205):
31t is worth emphasizing that we are making a semantic
point here—there may be a syntactic (attaclunent) ambiguity
in (11), but it&apos;s not one that has any semantic significance.
4 Ftelevant here is Horn&apos;s (101 notion of metalinguistic nega-
tion, which accounts for purely contrastive or contradicting
negation. The issues Horn discusses are also orthogonal to
the ambiguity in (12), since the ambiguity persists outside of
contrastive contexts.
(14) In that restaurant, if John is asked to wear a
tie, he wears a tie.
Here the preposed locative does not belong exclu-
sively to either the antecedent or the consequent of
the conditional; rather, the sentence says: if John
is asked to wear a tie in that restaurant, he wears
a tie in that restaurant. Thomason and Stalnaker
argue hence that the locative must be treated seman-
tically as a sentence operator. Cf. Cresswell ([7],
p.217) points out another example where the result
of preposing a locative is not a simple paraphrase of
its &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;:
At our house, everyone is eating.
Everyone is eating at our house.
Here there is a reading of the first which can
be paraphrased Everyone at our house is eating,
where the quantifier is restricted to people at our
house. The most important point to make here
is that &amp;quot;preposing&amp;quot; generates new readings, read-
ings unavailable for unpreposed adverbial locatives.
So if these examples are evidence for a sentence-
operator semantics for locatives, then it&apos;s a seman-
tics limited to locatives found in this position. The
&amp;quot;wide-scope&amp;quot; readings occur only for locatives in this
&amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; (sentence-initial) position.6 It would be se-
mantically implausible to regard the preposed adver-
bials here as mere stylistic variants of nonpreposed
elements.6
But we note further that locations can be restricted
by discourse context alone:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.394974">
(16) Joan lived in LA. She often went swimming.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988253764705882">
We naturally interpret Joan as swimming in LA; and
such effects can extend indefinitely through discourse.
We propose to analyze both Thomason and Stal-
naker&apos;s example and Cresswell&apos;s example as RE-
STRICTING TOPIC locatives that restrict some loca-
tion roles in the sentence to follow. In the case of
(14), the restriction applies to the locations of both
the antecedent and consequent clauses of the condi-
tional sentence; in the case of (15), the restriction

operator adverbials; The number of the planets is necessarily

scope reading of necessarily.
°It is syntactically implausible as well to regard restrict-
ing topic elements as stylistic variants of unpreposed elements,
since some preposed elements can only occur preposed:

applies to the quantifier Everyone, limiting its do-
main to those individuals at &amp;quot;our house.&amp;quot;&apos; This has
the consequence that there is a class of restrictive
topic-position modifiers that cannot be analyzed as
preposed adverbials.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999958">
3.3 Analogy with NPs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996821">
Jackendoff ([12], Chap.3) is partially devoted to ar-
ticulating the strong semantic analogy between loca-
tive phrases and noun phrases. The analogy includes
quantification, a distinction between definite and in-
definite reference, deictic reference, and anaphora.
Jackendoff&apos;s programmatic point is that the seman-
tic status of locatives is therefore the same as that of
NPs: they both refer and both function as arguments.
It is noteworthy that locatives have explicitly quan-
tificational forms, as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.708941">
(17) Bill sang everywhere Mary sang.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.88663393939394">
This suggests that quantified locatives have the same
relationship to simple locatives as general NPs (such
as every small country) have to singular NPs (such as
the smallest country, a small country, and Honduras).
Though SIMPLE locatives show no scope variation
with respect to other scope operators, quantified loca-
tives (such as everywhere and nowhere) clearly do.
But this scope is due to the quantification, not to the
locative function. Since locatives occupy argument
positions in predications, quantified locatives are sim-
ply quantifications over those predications, exactly
analogous to nonlocative quantifications.
Second, we find similarly noteworthy the indefi-
nitely referring locative somewhere. We note that its
particular reference (like that of someone) is available
for subsequent anaphoric use. That is, (18) may be
understood to claim that Ed works where Al works.8
Al lives somewhere on the Ohio,
and Ed works there.
Third, we note that deictic locative reference is
possible (using here or there), just as deictic non-
locative reference is (using pronouns or demonstra-
tives). We address the fourth and final reminder of
the analogy between NP and locative reference, loca-
tive anaphora, in Section 3.4, immediately below.
7We don&apos;t claim to offer a complete analysis of these topic-
locatives (nothing we have said makes it clear how these re-
strictions are enforced, or what the constraints on them are);
but we offer a plausibility argument that these are cases of a
somewhat different color.
8This contrasts with examples of locative anaphors with
simple locative antecedents, examined below in Section 3.4.
Cf. (19).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.949615">
3.4 Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999207">
Viewing simple locatives as analogous to singular
NPs, we obtain a simple account of the anaphoric po-
tential of locatives by taking them to denote spatial
regions. The functioning of locatives as antecedents
for the locative pro-form there then provides addi-
tional evidence that simple locatives are in a class
with singular NPs. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.665821">
(19) Al lives on the Ohio, and Ed works there.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99457555">
(19) makes the claim, not that Al lives in the same
place Ed works, but that he lives on the same river
that Al works on. Thus the reference of both on the
Ohio and there appears to be the entire spatial re-
gion which is ON the Ohio (as opposed to any partic-
ular subregion of it). This region is uniquely (though
vaguely) determined in a given context by the name
of the river and the particular preposition on. We
are, in effect, claiming that the PP on the Ohio acts
as a sort of definite description of a particular spatial
region. Anaphoric reference back to it is reference
back to that same region.
A further note is worthwhile here. If the locative
phrase on the Ohio in (19) refers to the entire region
which may be so described (as we&apos;ve just argued),
then the LOCATION role of the predicates LIVE and
WORK must be construed as specifying a region &apos;within
which&apos; a relation is somewhere instantiated. Indeed,
we postulate this as a general property of location
roles within all predicates.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.677624">
3.5 Regional Intersection

<bodyText confidence="0.991320111111111">
Next consider a more complicated version of (19):

(
and Ed works there.
In (20) one may understand there as referring to the
intersection of the regions &apos;on the Ohio,&apos; and &apos;in Ken-
tucky&apos; (and again, NOT to the particular subpart of
that intersection where Al lives). In fact, this reading
is preferred. ( There may also be understood to refer
to one of the component superregions, and our anal-
ysis is fully compatible with this possibility.) Let&apos;s
consider how best to supply the intersective reference
for the pronoun there.
In (20) the two locative expressions in the first
clause simultaneously constrain the same location
role. In general, each successive locative in a clause
further narrows the region filling the location role:

&apos;flit&apos; is the intersection operation over regions. Cf.
Section 5.2 for formal discussion.
Now, since the filler of a Location role is always
a single region, the anaphoric potential illustrated in
(20) is explained. It would remain unexplained if each
locative introduced a distinct predication.

4 Syntax/Semantics Mapping
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
We employ a syntax/semantics interface that&apos;s inno-
vative in two respects: first, we allow that adjuncts
(locatives) be interpreted as arguments, rather than
operators. Cf. McConnell-Ginet ([14],p.167ff) for
a similar proposal about manner adverbs. Second,
we allow that multiple locatives (in the same verb
phrase) jointly determine a single location argument
via the intersection of regions. Thus we allow sev-
eral syntactic dependents corresponding to a single
semantic argument. This challenges a standard work-
ing assumption about the syntax-semantics mapping
made in a number of frameworks,9 but it leads to
a neater semantic account: by allowing several loca-
tive specifiers to constrain a single role, we account
more easily for the permutability of locatives, and we
provide the right range of anaphoric antecedents.

5.2 Functional Location Terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988798">
Functional location terms are functional terms denot-
ing regions. These are of two general sorts, simple
and intersective. The simple ones consist of a prepo-
sitional functor applied to an appropriate argument,
while the intersective ones consist of a regional in-
tersection functor applied to a set of regions. As an
example, consider the following location term, which
might serve as the translation (in a given context) of
the iterated locatives on the Ohio in Kentucky near

<bodyText confidence="0.990179857142857">
This is a complex location term whose components
are simple functional location terms. NEAR1 should
denote (e.g.) a function that maps Illinois onto a
region beginning at its borders and extending out a
short distance.
The functor of an intersective location term de-
notes the regional intersection function, which maps
RI, R2, ... , Ry, onto their intersection R. More for-
mally, we postulate that spatial regions, partially or-
dered by the subregion relation (written C.„), form a
LATTICE. The intersection of regions is then their
lattice-theoretic MEET (written flu), the greatest
lower bound with respect to CR.
The commutativity and associativity of (IR jus-
tify specifying its arguments via sets. The order-
indifference of set specification accounts for the per-
mutability of locatives illustrated in (6).
We will also make use of the following familiar lat-
tice theorem:

The other sort of simplifying inference given in Sec-

<bodyText confidence="0.99847824">
Both the premise and the conclusion of (27) are in-
terpreted as denoting situation-types; each is true if
there exists a situation of the type it denotes. Since
every situation of the type denoted by the premise
is necessarily also of the type denoted by the con-
clusion, the truth of the premise necessarily entails
the truth of the conclusion. This accounts for the
validity of (3) in the situation-theoretic framework of
NFLT. In a fixed-arity framework, one would repre-
sent the conclusion as existentially quantifying over a
location argument-position; the inference would then
be existential generalization.
We recall that (7), repeated here for convenience,
is invalid, while the similar (8) (right) is valid:
Tom works in NY.
Tom works in Boston.
./. Tom works in NY in Boston.
Tom works in NY.
Tom works in Boston.
Tom works in NY and in Boston.
The reason is that the premises of the former may
locate two different &apos;working&apos; events while its conclu-
sion refers to one. The conclusion of the latter, on the
other hand, may refer to distinct &apos;working&apos; events. Its
translation into NFLT is:

6 Adnominal Locatives

<bodyText confidence="0.814379363636364">
We propose above that the ability to induce scope
effects is a litmus test for distinguishing arguments
and operators. This test, together with anaphoric
evidence, suggests a heterodox treatment of adnomi-
nal locatives. In a nutshell, these locatives might be
arguments as well.
(29) Few cars in Ohio rust.

There is a reasonable competing (predicative) analy-
sis of the use of adnominal locatives, however.

Note that in both formulations there is reference to
a region, and that the locative cannot participate in
scope ambiguities.12

well known (semantically significant) attachment ambiguity
between adverbial and adnontinal loactives may be represented
here:

7.1 External Operator Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930464285714">
Cresswell ([7], p.13) poses the problem of analysis for
adverbial modification thus:
There are two basic approaches to the
analysis of adverbial constructions [...] One
is to follow Richard Montague and treat
them as sentential operators of the same
syntactical category as not. The other is to
follow Donald Davidson and represent them
in the predicate calculus with the aid of an
extra argument place in the verb to be mod-
ified [...]
We suspect that Cresswell would classify the tack
taken toward locative adverbials in this paper as an
&amp;quot;extra argument&amp;quot; analysis, but we shall note be-
low some important differences between our approach
and Davidson&apos;s.
We find fault with the operator analysis of locative
adverbials since it inherently attributes a scope to
locatives which, as Section 3.1 shows, isn&apos;t reflected
in natural language semantics. It is also clear that
the simplifying and commutative inferences for loca-
tives noted in Section 2 are not predicted by the ex-
ternal operator analysis. Locatives wouldn&apos;t neces-
sarily have these properties any more than negation
or the modal adverbs. Finally, we note as problem-
atic the comportment of the operator analysis with
the anaphoric evidence, particularly where multiple
locatives are concerned.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998466">
7.2 Davidsonian Analyses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99972225">
Davidson [8], and, following him, Bartsch [2] and
Sondheimer [18] have proposed that adverbial modifi-
cation is best represented using an unexpected argu-
ment place within a predicate. Bartsch ([2], pp.122-
39) and Sondheimer [18] focus on locative construc-
tions, so we concentrate on those works here. Sond-
heimer ([18], pp.237-39) provides the following anal-
ysis:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.936452333333333">
John stumbled in the park under a tree.
(32)
3e(Stmbl(J,e) A In(e,p) A Under(e,t))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950945945946">
The standard logic textbook representation of an in-
transitive verb such as stumble uses a ONE-PLACE
predicate, where Sondheimer, following Davidson,
uses the TWO-PLACE predicate signifying a relation
between an individual and an event. This is the &amp;quot;ex-
tra argument place&amp;quot; that distinguishes Davidsonian
treatments. It is worth noting that this approach ac-
counts for the logical properties of locatives that we
noted in Section (2) above. The simplification and
commutativity of locatives follow from the proposi-
tional logic of conjunction.
The most important differences between Davidso-
nian analyses and our own are the ability to account
for locative anaphors, and the treatment of scope.
As presented in Section 3.4 above, our treatment
provides correct regional antecedents for the loca-
tive anaphor there. On the other hand, Davidsonian
treatments make no explicit reference to regions at all
(to which anaphors might refer), and further provide
no mechanism for referring to the intersective regions
that were seen to be required in the analysis of (20).
Our analysis places simple locatives within the
scope of all sentence operators. The Davidsonian
analysis creates multiple propositions, and scope-
inducing elements such as negation can then be ana-
lyzed as including some, but not all of these proposi-
tions within their scope. For this reason, Davidsonian
treatments are much less specific in their predictions
vis-a-vis scope (than the one proposed here). Bartsch
([2], p.133) indicates e.g. that she would allow sen-
tential negation to have scope over some of the con-
juncts in logical forms such as (32), but not others;
and Sondheimer ([18], p.250) seems to have a similar
move in mind in his discussion of almost as in I al-
most locked him in the closet. As indicated in Section
3.2 above, we regard such renderings as confusions of
scope and focus.

Jackendoff ([12], Chap.3,9) argues that reference to
places be recognized in semantic theory, thus allow-
ing that locative phrases refer in the same way that
NPs do, and that they function as arguments. But
Jackendoff never examined inferences involving loca-
tives, nor did he attempt to deal with the prima fa-
cie difficulties of the argument analysis—the fact that
locatives occur optionally and multiply. It is the lat-
ter facts which make the argument analysis techni-
cally difficult. Finally, where we have been precise
about the semantics of the location role, emphasizing
that it specifies a region WITHIN WHICH a relation
must hold, Jackendoff was less exact. On the other
hand, Jackendoff&apos;s analysis of PATH EXPRESSIONS is
intriguingly analogous to that of locatives, and offers
opportunity for extension of the work here.

tics, and would like to have the operator/argument

issue both ways: he allows that locatives might be
external modifiers or arguments. But he offers no ev-
idence to support this postulate of ambiguity. Ter
Meulen ([20], also working within situation seman-
tics, provides a means of referring to the location of
complex events, such as the event of two detectives
solving a crime. She crucially requires a reference for
locative expressions, and her proposals seem compat-
ible with ours.
Talmy [19], Herskovits [9], and Kautz [13] theorize
about the INTERPRETATION of locative expressions,
and especially how this is affected by the sorts of ob-
jects referred to in locative expressions. Much of this
latter work may be regarded as complementary to our
own, since we have not attempted to characterize in
any detail the manner in which context affects the
choice of functional denotation for particular locative
prepositions.

8.1 Claims
</subsectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.902758818181818">
1. Locative expressions (e.g. north of Boston near
Harry) denote regions of space. The denotations
may be referred to anaphorically.
2. Locative expressions are used adverbially to con-
strain a location argument in a relation defined
by a verb. Thus simple locatives fail to show
scope (like proper names).
3. Relations are upwardly monotonic at location ar-
guments: if a relation holds at R, then it holds
at every containing R&apos;.
4. When multiple locatives are used, the intersec-

<bodyText confidence="0.8732936">
tion of their denoted regions plays a location
role. This describes the truth conditions and
anaphoric potential of such uses, and predicts
correctly the permutability and omissibility of
locatives.

8.2 Qualifications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985624564102564">
We don&apos;t claim that all reference to regions is through
upwardly monotonic location arguments. On the
contrary, regions can stand in relations in a variety
of other ways. To take an obvious case, the sub-
region relation is upwardly monotonic (transitive),
but only in one (superregion) argument—it&apos;s not up-
wardly monotonic in the first (subregion) argument.
Here are two more fairly transparent examples of ref-
erence to locations that don&apos;t involve the location ar-
guments of predicates, and therefore aren&apos;t upwardly
monotonic:
Tom likes it in Mendocino.
.1. Tom likes it in California.
George VI ruled in England.
./. George VI ruled in Europe.
We claim that the regions referred to in (33) aren&apos;t
location arguments, but rather theme (or patient) ar-
guments. There are other examples of monotonicity
failing that are less easily dismissed, however:
It is the tallest in Palo Alto
./. It is the tallest in California.
./. He is alone in the house.
The apparent location argument of these relations
(and of all superlatives) is especially interesting be-
cause it not only fails to be upwardly monotonic, it
even turns out to be downwardly monotonic. We wish
to deny that these phrases denote regions which play
location roles—more specifically, we allow that the
phrases denote regions, but we distinguish the seman-
tic role that the regions play. In the case of LOCATION
arguments, the intended semantics requires that the
relation hold somewhere within the region denoted.
In the case of (34), however, the relation can only
hold be said to hold if it holds throughout the region
denoted. It is this implicit (universal) quantification
that explains the failure of upward monotonicity, of
course. We symbolize this sort of role as throughout,
and represent the downwardly monotonic (34) in the
following way:

<bodyText confidence="0.99985125">
(We emphasize that this is intended to illustrate
the distinction between the various semantic roles
that locations play—it is not proferred as a serious
analysis of the superlative.)

We&apos;d like to improve this account in several ways:
first, we&apos;d like to understand the interface between
the syntax and semantics more rigorously. Section 4
explains what is unusual about our views here, but
the model of syntax/semantics cooperation it sug-
gests is something we&apos;d like to explore. Second, we
need an account of preposed locatives, as Section 3.2

admits. Third, we&apos;d like to describe the relationship
between predicates relating objects and regions on
the one hand with regions occupied by the objects, as
Section 6 shows. Fourth, we&apos;d be interested in explor-
ing the relation between our work on the semantics
of locatives with work on the contextually dependent
interpretation of locatives, such as the work by Her-
skovits [9] and Retz-Schmidt [16].

Since simple locatives occupy argument posithey do in scope ambiguities— common view, which sees locatives as logical operators. Our proposal justifies common representational practice in computational linguistics, accounting for how locative expressions function anaphorically, and explaining a wide range of inference involving locatives.

The view that locatives occupy an ARGUMENT position within a predication is contrasted with the view that they are EXTERNAL OPERATORS (cf. Cresswell [7]), Or MODIFIERS on predications (cf. Davidson [8] or Sondheimer [181). In fact, however, the analysis of locative phrases as arguments jibes well with the practice of most computational linguists; cf. Allen [1], pp.198-207 and the references there, [1], p.218. The present effort contributes to the justification and explication of this practice. Our approach is closest to Jackendoff [12]. We follow Jackendoff first, in suggesting that locative phrases are referential in the same way that noun phrases (NPs) are; and second, in taking locative adverbials to function as arguments. But there is a significant foundational problem implicit in the hypothesis that locatives are arguments: locatives, unlike standard arguments in the predicate calculus, appear optionally and multiply. Predicate logic does not accommodate the occurrence of multiple arguments in a single argument position. We solve this technical problem by allowing that multiple locatives CON142 STRAIN a single argument</context>
