Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9991109">
Preliminary surveys show that the lan-
guage of blogs is not restricted to the
more informal levels of expression. In-
stead blogs may include many kinds of
written language: from simple personal
notes to literary prose or poetry. The pa-
per presents a sample of Italian blogs and
comments on the results of the search of
literary forms in two Web corpora using
search engine queries.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993718316666667">
Close scrutiny of e-mails has revealed the pres-
ence of many different kinds of style in this
medium (Baron 2000: 250-2; Pistolesi 2003:
178-184 for Italian). The same appears to be true
for blogs. It is therefore difficult to determine
specific linguistic features of blogs. Even occa-
sional surveys however show that blogs are not
limited to “a language reminiscent of brief notes,
spoken asides, or short letters, rather than of es-
says or newsprint”. Such language plays an im-
portant role in blogs, but accounts for only a
small part of them. Many individual blogs aim
instead at a true “literary” status and have a cor-
respondingly high standard for word selection.
Therefore, the linguistic equilibrium of this
medium could be higher than expected. The pa-
per will try to describe the general linguistic fea-
tures of Italian blogs by contrasting them mainly
with the language of newspapers, giving appro-
priate quantitative data.
2 Preliminary qualitative analysis: a tex-
tual sample
As a reference sample of blogs we can take ten
blogs hosted by the Italian blog publishing site
Splinder.com (arguably the most popular site of
its kind). The sample was chosen by selecting the
most recent blog appearing in the site list of the
“Ultimi blog aggiornati” (‘Most recently updated
blogs’), and by selecting the first page of the
postings published by the blog itself in Novem-
ber 2005 (if it had at least two postings in
November). The selection was made at different
times on one given day (29 December 2005)
Some features of the selected blogs are described
in Table 1.
A post taken from one of the less formal blogs
in the sample (di ritorno da...) shows many of
the linguistic features commonly ascribed to this
kind of writing:
giornata più tranquilla..sarà che sono a casa mia..a
fare la mia vita..parlo appunto di mia perchè la vita
parallela che sto facendo a milano non mi
appartiene..quindi non posso dire che sia mia..che di-
scorso complesso però ci stava dentro bene nel conte-
sto..
ho programmato il mio capodanno..dopo due anni
consecutivi in una baita in montagna quest&apos;anno lascio
l&apos;italia..pronta per 4 gg in scozia con tre amiche..
non vedo l&apos;ora..partirò il 30 di dicembre..aspetto
quel giorno e intanto mi preparo per quattro esami al-
l&apos;università..
ah...il viaggio al prezzo di 45 euro di volo e 90 di
ostello..ultra risparmio...
The text describes the planning of a holday
trip in Scotland for New Year&apos;s Eve and personal
feeliings.The post shows also many unprofes-
sional graphic choices (no capital letters for
proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence,
no spacing after punctuation marks, perchè in-
stead of perché) and the frequent use of three (or,

<bodyText confidence="0.999746054545455">
wrongly, two) suspension points. The latter fea-
ture, also illustrated in Table 1, is considered one
of the most common features of blogs and in this
case it is surely used to give a feeling of “spoken
language” to the text.
The language of the other blogs in the sample
is, instead, very different. Suspension points are
used in the blog SoleLuna in order to create high-
pitched literary texts. This is a kind of lyrical de-
scription of a problematic relationship:
Cancelli i tuoi passi nell&apos;ombra di te stesso e scom-
pari e compari quando e come più ti aggrada... Ed io
mi lascio prendere dai pensieri e mi lascio intorpidire
dai ricordi... Mi rivesto di te.. di noi.. Ho freddo.. Cer-
co di scaldarmi con il ricordo di un amore... Non ti
amo. Amo il ricordo di quello che eravamo... E mi
sfuggono via dalla mente le sensazioni e scivolano via
gli odori.. si sbiadiscono i sapori... Tutto diventa la
sfumatura del proprio colore.. la parodia, la beffa...
Cerco di palpare le immagini e faccio attenzione a
non sgualcirle.. più di quanto non lo sia io...
This kind of lyric language is heavily based
upon the use of literary forms (“ti aggrada”),
complex rhetorical constructions, “-d eufonica”
and so on.
Midway between these two extremes we can
find blogs like Incontrista. The posts of this blog
are written in a language echoing newspaper edi-
torials and brilliant prose. Significantly, they
make no use of suspension points, as in this sec-
tione (where the author contrasts the average
psychological differences between female blog-
gers and female subscribers of dating sites):
E&apos; quindi un fatto ancora che le splinderine sono
mediamente delle ragazze migliori delle meetiche
proprio per questo motivo. Hanno capacità, caratteri-
stiche e aspetti che a me piacciono, come la voglia di
esprimersi, di raccontare, di scrivere, di comunicare,
di leggere, di scegliere, di assumere posizioni critiche.
Le splinderine fanno parte della fascia più esperta e
innovativa degli utenti internet, quelli che ne fanno un
utilizzo più consapevole, e che hanno una cultura più
elevata della media. Le splinderine sono donne che
hanno qualcosa da dire e vogliono compagni di alto li-
vello con cui cercano il confronto serrato e accettano
anche lo scontro.
It seems that none of those kinds of language
could today claim to be the main model for blog
writing. Free expression, literary prose and news-
paper writing seem to co-exist without a clear
dominant position. Of course, however, those
impressions can be given substance only through
extension of the field of search to a large set of
blogs. This is partly made possible by the use of
modern search engines.

3 Quantitative analysis of large corpora
using search engines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963791666667">
Some linguistic features of blogs can now be
probed and measured using search engines. For
instance, preliminary searches show that from
the orthographical point of view Italian blogs are
much more correct than the average of the Italian
web and that they are edited at least as well as
online newspapers (Tavosanis in print b). Other
indicators related to the use of “neo-standard”
Italian forms (Berruto 1987) in the field of per-
sonal pronouns and demonstratives suggest a
kinship between blogs and newspapers (Tavosa-
nis in print a).
According to those searches, the main differ-
ences between blog posts and newspaper articles
are not linked to writing accuracy or to different
morphological choices. We can therefore assume
as a working hypothesis that the main differences
between blogs and newspapers in fact relate to
lexicon and syntax.
The syntactic status of many blogs is probably
well represented by the textual samples chosen
above (widespread use of suspension points be-
ing the most conspicuous feature). However,
close survey of this level can probably be ob-
tained only through the encoding of a wide cor-
pus with syntactic tagging.
The lexical features of blogs can instead be
studied through simple search engine analysis
(see again Tavosanis in print a and b for details
of this method). Newspaper editing in Italy, en-
forced by a strong tradition and dedicated staff,
excludes words considered too expressive (apart
from those acknowledged by the same tradition:
Bonomi 2002). Blogs, on the other hand, can in-
clude forms taken from every level of linguistic
use. We can therefore expect that both literary
and low forms are more used in blogs than in
newspapers.
Two Web corpora were then selected: the web
site of the newspaper La Repubblica, indexed
and queried through the Google interface (= R),
and the whole of the blogs indexed in the beta
version of Blogsearch.google.com (= B). Of
course, no exact data are available on the consis-
tency of the two collections and the number of
tokens indexed. The two corpora seem however
roughly equal in size: the search of a common
word like questo gives 427,000 occurrences in R
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994011">
12

<bodyText confidence="0.999968074626866">
and 467,000 in B; the search of quello 209,000
(R) and 257,608 occurrences (B); the search of
lui 118,000 (R) and 159,970 occurrences (B);
and so on. Of course, since word frequency is
strongly correlated with the style and topic of the
texts (for the Italian situation see Bortolini 1971:
XIV-XV; Voghera 1993), this assessment cannot
be considered an exact estimate. It does however
give a preliminary quantitative estimate.
The highest frequency of vulgar words in the
B corpus is of course undisputed, since newspa-
per editing is a strong barrier against this kind of
language, and it needs no particular demonstra-
tion, e.g., we can find 30,310 occurrences of the
word cazzo in B against 278 in R, and so on.
It is more difficult to demonstrate the highest
frequency of literary language, which in the Ital-
ian tradition has a wide and varied lexicon. The
abundance of synonyms and dispersion of forms
lead one to focus searches on large groups of
“weak” words instead of a limited set of “strong”
words.
Next the list of “literary” verbs beginning with
the letters b, e and v in the De Mauro (2000) dic-
tionary was selected for analysis. The chosen
verbs were 31 (b-), 47 (e-) and 49 (v-). Many of
them also had non-literary uses and/or coincided
with other Italian words: therefore only the
words without homographs were used for the
search, where every meaning recorded in the dic-
tionary was marked at least as “obsolete” (code
OB), “literary” (LE) or “bureaucratic” (BU).
This left 23 (b-), 28 (e-) and 21 (v-) verbs. The
two corpora were then searched for the infinitive
forms of the verbs. Many of them did not appear
at all: baiare, balbuzzire, ballonzare (1 occurren-
ce in a text written in the dialect of Naples), ba­
sciare, benedicere (2 occurrences in two texts
written in the dialect of Naples), biancicare, bia­
stemiare, blasmare, bombire, botare, botarsi,
bravare, buccinare, bulicare, ebere, ecclissare,
educere, enfiare, enfiarsi, escomunicare, escuo­
tere, escusare, esinanire, espedire, esseguire,
esterminare, estollere, estollersi, estorre, estrue­
re, estruare, esturbare, esurire, evellere, evenire,
vagheggiarsi, vanare, vengiare, vengiarsi, ver­
berare, verdicare, verdire, vernare, verzicare,
vilificare and vincire.
The search also revealed that a verb marked in
the dictionary as “literary” was instead widely
used in both corpora: vigilare. While other forms
occurred at most 94 times, in the corpora there
are 644 occurrences of vigilare, evenly balanced
(332 in B, 312 in R). It therefore appears more
correct to consider this verb as a “common”
word, without literary connotations, and to ex-
clude it from further analysis.
In a second phase, many forms were excluded
from counts since they resulted simple typos or
broken forms of different words (e.g., many oc-
currences of ventare are in fact occurrences of
widely used verbs like diventare or inventare,
with incorrect spacing). Only words where the
possibilities of misspellings seemed low were
therefore included In the counts.
After this sifting, the forms represented in the
corpus occurred as described in Table 2:

It seems therefore that some Italian blogs have
in fact a higher proportion of a random selection
of literary words than Italian newspapers. Further
searches should be able to confirm or refute this
finding.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996936692307692">
Preliminary analyses of Italian blogs seem to
confute the simple equivalence “blogs = informal
text”. Clearly, both statistical tools and special
monitoring software are needed to give this kind
of search more focus and more depth. Future
searches must also achieve a better understand-
ing of the coverage of search engines and should
be based upon different search engines. It would
be useful, moreover, to identify and exploit other
searchable indicators of the linguistic quality of a
text. Anyway in future researches adequate space
should be allowed for the assessment of the pres-
ence of literary features in many blogs.
