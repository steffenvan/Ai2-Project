ABSTRACT: The design and implementation of a paraphrase
component for a natural language question-answer system
(CO-OP) is presented. A major point made is the role of
given and new information in formulating a paraphrase
that differs in a meaningful way from the user&apos;s
question. A description is also given of the
transformational grammar used by the paraphraser to
generate questions.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718074074074">
In a natural language interface to a database query
system, a paraphraser can be used to ensure that the
system has correctly understood the user. Such a
paraphraser has been developed as part of the CO-OP
system (KAPLAN 791. In CO-OP, an internal
representation of the user&apos;s question is passed to the
paraphraser which then generates a new version of the
question for the user. Upon seeing the paraphrase, the
user has the option of rephrasing her/his question
before the system attempts to answer it. Thus, if the
question was not interpreted correctly, the error can be
caught before a possibly lengthy search of the database
is initiated. Furthermore, the user is assured that the
answer s/he receives is an answer to the question asked
and not to a deviant version of it.
The idea of using a paraphraser in the above way is not
new. TO date, other systems have used canned templates
to form paraphrases, filling in empty slots in the
pattern with information from the user&apos;s question
(WALTZ 78; COW 78). In CO-OP, a transformational
grammar is used to generate the paraphrase from an
internal representation of the question. Moreover, the
CO-OP paraphraser generates a question that differs in a
meaningful way from the original question. It makes use
of a distinction between given and new information to
Indicate to the user the existential presuppositions
made in her/his question.

II. OVERVIEW OF THE CO-OP SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998670517241379">
The CO-OP system is aimed at infrequent users of
database query systems. These casual users are likely
to be unfamiliar with computer systems and unwilling to
invest the time needed to learn a formal query language.
Being able to converse naturally in English enables such
persons to tap the information available in a database.
In order to allow the question-answer process to proceed
naturally, CO-OP follows some of the &amp;quot;co-operative
principles&amp;quot; of conversation (GRICE 751. In particular,
the system attempts to find meaningful answers to failed
questions by addressing any incorrect assumptions the
questioner may have made in her/his question. When the
direct response to a question would be simply &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;, CO-OP gives a more informative response by
correcting the questioner&apos;s mistaken assumptions.
The false assumptions that CO-OP corrects are the
existential presuppositions of the question.* Since
these presuppositions can be computed from the surface
structure of the question, a large store of semantic
knowledge for inferencing purposes is not needed. In
*For example, in the question &amp;quot;Which users work on
projects sponsored by NASA?&amp;quot;, the speaker makes the
existential presupposition that there are projects
sponsored by NASA.
fact, a lexicon and database schema are the only
items which contain domain-specific information.
Consequently, the CO-OP system is a portable one; a
change of database requires that only these two
knowledge sources he modified.

III. THE CO-OP PARAPHRASER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987556358490566">
CO-OP&apos;s paraphraser provides the only means of
error-checking for the casual user. If the user is
familiar with the system, s/he can ask to have the
intermediate results printed, in which case the parser&apos;s
output and the formal database query will be shown. The
naive user however, is unlikely to understand these
results. It is for this reason that the paraphraser was
designed to respond in English.
The use of English to paraphrase queries creates several
problems. The first is that natural language is
Inherently ambiguous. A paraphrase must clarify the
system&apos;s interpretation of possible ambiguous phrases in
the question without introducing additional ambiguity.
One particular type of ambiguity that a paraphraser must
address is caused by the linear nature of sentences. A
modifying relative clause, for example, frequently
cannot be placed directly after the noun phrase it
modifies. In such cases, the semantics of the sentence
may indicate the correct choice of modified noun phrase,
but occasionally,, the sentence may be genuinely
ambiguous. For example, question (A) below has two
interpretations, both equally plausible. The speaker
could be referring to books dating from the &apos;60s or to
computers dating from the &apos;fiOs.
(A) Which students read books on computers dating
from the &apos;50s?
A second problem in paraphrasing English queries is the
possibility of generating the exact question that was
originally asked. If a grammar were developed to simply
generate English from an underlying representation of
the question this possibility could he realized.
Instead, a method must be devised which can determine
how the phrasing should differ from the original.
The CO-OP paraphraser addresses both the problem of
ambiguity and the rephrasing of the question. It makes
the system&apos;s interpretation of the question explicit by
breaking down the clauses of the question and reordering
them dependent upon their function in the sentence.
Thus, question (A) above will result in either
paraphrase (B) or (C), reflecting the interpretation the
system has chosen.
(e) Assuming that there are books on computers
(those computers date from the &apos;50s), which
students read those books?
(C) Assuming that there are books on computers
(those books date from the &apos;60s), which students
read those books?
The method adopted guarantees that the paraphrase will
differ from the original except in cases where no
relative clauses or prepositional phrases were used. It
was formulated on the basis of a distinction between
given and new information and indicates to the user the
presuppositions s/he has made in the question in the

IV. LINGUISTIC BACKGROUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987244938271605">
As mentioned earlier, the lexicon and the database are
the sole sources of world knowledge for CO-OP. While
this design increases CO-OP&apos;s portability, it means that
little semantic information is available for the
paraphraser&apos;s use. Contextual information is also
limited since no running history or context is
maintained for a user session in the current version.
The input the paraphraser receives from the parser is
basically a syntactic parse tree of the question. Using
this information, the paraphraser most reconstruct the
question to obtain a phrasing different from the
original. The following question most therefore be
addressed:
What reasons are there for choosing one syntactic
form of expression over another?
Some linguists maintain that word order is affected by
functional roles elements play within the sentence.*
Terminology used to describe the types of roles that can
occur varies widely. Some of the distinctons that have
been described include given/new, topic/consent,
theme/theme, and presupposition/focus. Definitions of
these terms however, are not consistent (for example,
see (PRINCE 79) for a discussion of various usages of
&amp;quot;given/new&amp;quot;).
Nevertheless, one influence on expression does appear to
be the interaction of sentence content and the beliefs
of the speaker concerning the knowledge of the listener.
Some elements in the sentence function in conveying
Information which the speaker assumes is present in the
&amp;quot;consciousness&amp;quot; of the listener (CHAFE 76]. This
Information is said to be contextually dependent, either
by virtue of its presence in the preceding discourse or
because it is part of the shared world knowledge of the
dialog participants. In a question-answer system,
shared world knowledge refers to information which the
speaker assumes is present in the database. Information
functioning in the role just described has been termed
&amp;quot;given&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;New&amp;quot; labels all information in the sentence which is
presented as not retrievable from context. In the
declarative, elements functioning in asserting
information that the listener is presumed not to know
are called new. In the question, elements functioning
In conveying what the speaker wants to know (i.e.- what
s/he doesn&apos;t know) represent information which the
speaker presumes the listener is not already aware of.
Firbas identifies additional functions in the question.
Of these, (ii) is used here to augment the
Interpretation of new information. He says:
&amp;quot;(i) it indicates the want of knowledge on the part
of the inquirer and appeals to the informant to
satisfy this want.
(ii) (al it imparts knowledge to the informant in
that it informs him what the inquirer is
Interested in (what is on her/his mind) and
* Some other influences on syntactic expression are
discussed in (MORGAN and GREEN 731. They suggest that
stylistic reasons, in addition to some of the functions
discussed here, determine when different syntactic
constructions are to be used. They point out, for
example, that the passive tense is often used in
academic prose to avoid identification of agent and to
lend a scientific flavor to the text..
(b) from what particular angle the intimated
want of knowledge is to be satisfied.&amp;quot;
(F/RBAS 74; p.31)
Although word order vis-a-vis these and related
distinctions has been discussed in light of the
declarative sentence, less has been said about the
interrogative form. Halliday (HALLIDAY 67) and
Krizkova* are among the few to have analyzed the
question. Despite the fact that they arrive at
different conclusions**, the two follow similar lines of
reasoning. Krizkova argues that both the wh-item of the
wh-question and the finite verb (e.g. - &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;)
of the yes/no question point to the new information to
be disclosed in the response. These elements she
claims, are the only unknowns to the questioner.
Halliday, in discussing the yes/no question, also argues
that the finite verb is the only unknown. The polarity
of the text is in question and the finite element

Indicates this. •
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988475">
In this paper the interpretation of the unknown elements
in the question as defined by Krizkova and Halliday is
followed. The wh-items, in defining the questioner&apos;s
lack of knowledge, act as new information. Firbas&apos;
analysis of the functions in questions is used to
further elucidate the role of new information in
questions. The remaining elements are given
information. They represent information assumed by the
questioner to be true of the database domain. This
labeling of information within the question will allow
the construction of a natural paraphrase, avoiding
ambiguity.

V. FORMULATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9937938">
Following the analysis described above, the CO-OP
paraphraser breaks down questions into given and new
information. More specifically, an input question is
divided into three parts, of which (2) and (3) form the
new information.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998153666666667">

(2) FUnction ii(a] from Firbas above
(3) Function ii (b) from Firbas above

<bodyText confidence="0.993166740740741">
In terms of the question components, (2) comprises the
question with no subclauses as it defines the lack of
knowledge for the hearer. Part (3) comprises the direct
and indirect modifiers of the interrogative words as
they indicate the angle from which the question was
asked. They define the attributes of the missing
Information for the hearer. Part (1) is formed from the
remaining clauses.
As an example, consider question (3):
CD) Which division of the computing facility works
on projects using oceanography research?
Following the outline above, part (2) of the paraphrase
will be the question minus subclauses: &amp;quot;Which division
works on projects?&amp;quot;. Part (3), the modifiers of the
interrogative words, will be &amp;quot;of the computing facility&amp;quot;
which modifies &amp;quot;which division&amp;quot;. The remaining clause

** It should be noted that Halliday and Krizkova discuss
the unknowns in the question in order to define the
theme and theme of a question. Although they agree
about the unknowns for the questioner, they disagree
about which elements function as theme and which
function as theme. A full discussion of their analysis
and conclusions is given in MCKEOWN 791.

&amp;quot;projects using oceanography research&amp;quot; is considered
given information. The three parts can then be
assembled into a natural sequence:
(E) Assuming that there are projects using
oceanography research, which division works on
those projects? Look for a division of the
computing facility.*
In question (D), information belonging to each of the
three categories occurred in the question. If one of
these types of information is missing, the question will
be presented minus the initial or concluding clauses.
Only part (2) of the paraphrase will invariably occur.
If more than one clause occurs in a particular category,
the question will be furthered splintered. Additional
given information is parenthesized following the
&amp;quot;assuming that ...&amp;quot; clause. Example (F) below
illustrates the paraphrase for a question containing
several clauses of given information and no clauses
defining specific attributes of the missing information.
Clauses containing information characterized by category
(3) will be presented as separate sentences following
the stripped-down question. (G) below demonstrates a
paraphrase containing more than one clause of this type
of information.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998547088235294">
The paraphraser&apos;s first step in processing is to build a
tree structure from the representation it is given. The
tree is then divided into three separate trees
reflecting the division of given and new information in
the question. The design of the tree allows for a
simple set of rules which flatten the tree. The final
stage of processing in the paraphraser is translation.
In the translation phase, labels in the parser&apos;s
representation are translated into their corresponding
words. During this process, necessary transformations
of the grammar are performed upon the string.
Several aspects of the implementation will not be
discussed here, but a description can be found in
(MCKEOWN 791. The method used by the paraphraser to
handle conjunction, disjunction, and limited
quantification is one of these. A second function of
the paraphraser is also described in (MCKEOWN 791. The
set of procedures used to paraphrase the user&apos;s query
can also be used to generate an English version of the
parser&apos;s output. If the tree is not divided into given
and new information, the flattening and transformational
rules can he applied to produce a question that is not
in the three-part form. In CO-OP, generation is used to
produce corrections of the user&apos;s mistaken
presuppositions.
* This example, as well as all sample questions and
paraphrases that follow, were, taken from actual sessions
with the paraphraser. Question ( A )snd its possible
paraphrases (B) and (C) are the only examples that were
not run on the paraphraser.
A. THE PHRASE STRUCTURE TREE
In its initial processing, the paraphraser transforms
the parser&apos;s representation into one that is more
convenient for generation purposes. The resultant
structure is a tree that highlights certain syntactic
features of the question. This initial processing gives
the paraphraser some independence from the CO-OP system.
Were the parser&apos;s representation changed or the
component moved to a new system, only the initial
processing phase need be modified.
The paraphraser&apos;s phrase structure tree uses the main
verb of the question as the root node of the tree. The
subject of the main verb is the root node of the left
suhtree, the object (if there is one) the root node of
the right subtree. In the current system, the use of
binary relations in the parser&apos;s representation (see
(KAPLAN 791 for a description of Meta Query Language)
creates the illusion that every verb or preposition has
a subject and object. The paraphraser&apos;s tree does allow
for the representation of other constructions should the
incoming language use them.
Each of the subtrees represents other. clauses in the
question. Both the subject and the object of the main
verb will have a suhtree for each other clause it
participates in. If a noun in one of these clauses also
participates in another clause in the sentence, it will
have subtrees too.
As an example, consider the question: &amp;quot;Which active
users advised by Thomas Wirth work on projects in area
3?&amp;quot;. The phrase structure tree used in the paraphraser
is shown in Figure 1. Since &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; is the main verb, it
will be the root node of the tree. &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; is root of
the left suhtree, &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot; of the right. Each noun
participates in one other clause and therefore has one
subtree. Note that the adjective &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; does not
appear as part of the tree structure. Instead, it is
closely hound to the noun it modifies and is treated as
a property of the noun.

B. DIVIDING THE TREE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888444444444">
The constructed tree is computationally suited for the
three-part paraphrase. The tree is flattened after it
has been divided into subtrees containing given
information and the two types of new information. The
splitting of the tree is accomplished by first
extracting the topmost smallest portion of the tree
containing the wh-item. At the very least, this will
include the root node plus the left and right subtree
root nodes. This portion of the tree is the stripped
down question. The clauses which define the particular
aspect from which the question is asked are found by
searching the left and right subtrees for the wh-item or
questioned noun. The subtree whose root node is the
wh-item contains these clauses. Note that this may be
the entire left or right subtree or may only be a
subtree of one of these. The remainder of the tree
represents given information. Figure 2 illustrates this
division for the previous example.

In other words, each of the subtrees will be linearized
by doing a pre-order traversal of that subtree. As a
node in a subtree has three pieces of information
associated with it, one more rule is required to expend
a node. A node consists of:

where arc-label is the label of the verb or preposition
used in the parse tree and set-label the label of a noun

noun phrase functions as subject or object in the
clause; it is used by the subject-aux transformation and
does not apply to the expansion rule. The following
rule expands a node:

The tree of given information is flattened first. It is
part of the left or right subtree of the phrase
structure tree and therefore is flattened by a pre-order
traversal. It is during the flattening stage that the
words &apos;Assuming that there (be) ... &apos; are inserted to
introduce the clause of given information. &apos;Be&amp;quot; will
agree with the subject of the clause. If there is more
than one clause, parentheses are inserted around the
additional ones. The tree representing the stripped
down question is flattened next. It is followed by the
modifiers of the questioned noun. The phrase &apos;Look for&apos;
is inserted before the first clause of modifiers.

D. TRANSFORMATIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971282230769231">
The grammar used in the paraphraser is a
transformational one. In addition to the basic
flattening rules described above, the following
transformations are used:
-fronting
&apos;jhnegation
&apos;do-support
(subject-aux inversion
affix-hopping
contraction
has deletion
The curved lines indicate the ordering restrictions.
There are two connected groups of transformations. If
wh-fronting applies, then so will do-support,
subject-aux inversion, and affix-hopping. The second
group of transformations is invoked through the
application of negation. It includes do-support,
contraction, and affix-hopping. Has-deletion is not
affected by the absence or presence of other
transformations. A description of the transformation
rules follows. The rules used here are based on
analyses described by (AKMAJIAN and HE)Y 75] and
analyses described by (CULL/COVER 751.
The rule for wh -fronting is specified as follows, where
SD abbreviates structural description and SC, structural
change:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.517479">
SD: X - NP - Y
1 2 3
SC: 2+10 3
condition: 2 dominates wh
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.992413285714286">
The first step in the implementation of wh-fronting is a
search of the tree for the wh-item. A slightly
different approach is used for paraphrasing than is used
for generation. The difference occurs because in the
original question, the NP to be fronted may be the head
noun of some relative clauses or prepositional phrases.
When generating, these clauses must be fronted along
with the head noun. Since the clauses of the original
question are broken down for the paraphrase, it will
never be the case when paraphrasing that the NP to be
fronted also dominates relative clauses or prepositional
phrases. FOE&apos; this reason, when paraphrase mode is used,
the applicability of wh-fronting is tested for and is
applied in the flattening process of the stripped down
question. If it applies, only one word need be moved to
the initial position.
When generation is being done, the applicability of
wh-fronting is tested for immediately before flattening.
If the transformation applies, the tree is split. The
subtree of which the wh -item is the root is flattened
separately from the remainder of the tree and is
attached in fronted position to the string resulting
from flattening the other part.
After wh-fronting has been applied, do-support is
invoked. In CO-OP, the underlying representation of the
qestion does not contain modals or auxiliary verbs.
/hue, fronting the wh-item necessitates supplying an
auxiliary. The following rule is used for do-support:
SD: NP - NP - tense - V - X
1 2 3 4
SC: 1 do+2 3 4
condition: 1 dominates wh
Subject-aux inversion is activated bmnediately
afterwards. Again, if wh-fronting applied, subject-aux
inversion will apply also. The rule is:

Affix-hopping follows subject-aux inversion. In the
paraphraser it is a combination of what is commonly
thought of as affix-hopping and number-agreement. Tense
and number are attributes of all verbs in the parser&apos;s
representation. When an auxiliary is generated, the
tense and number are &amp;quot;hopped&amp;quot; from the verb to the
auxiliary. Formally:
SD: X - AUX - Y - tense-num-V - Z
1 2 3 4 5 6
SC: 1 2+4 3 0 5 6
Some transformational analyses propose that wh-fronting
and subject-aux inversion apply to the relative clause
as well as the question. In the CO-OP paraphraser, the
head-noun is properly positioned by the flattening
process and wh-fronting need not he used. Subject-aux
inversion however, may be applicable. In cases where
the head noun of the clause is not its subject,
subject-aux inversion results in the proper order.
-The rule for negation is tested during the translation
phase of execution. It has been formalized as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3464535">
SD: X - tense-V - NP - Y
1 2 3 4
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9411842">
SC: 1 2+no 3 4
condition: 3 marked as negative
In Ehe CO-OP representation, an indication of negation
is carried on the object of a binary relation (see
[KAPLAN 79]). When generating an English representation
of the question, it is possible in some cases to express
negation as modification of the noun (see question (H)
below). In all cases however, negation can be indicated
as pert of the verb (see version (/) of question (H)).
Therefore, when the object is marked as negative, the
paraphraser moves the negation to become part of the
verbal element.
(H) Which students have no advisors?
(I) Which students don&apos;t have advisors?
In English, the negative marker is attached to the
auxiliary of the verbal element and therefore, as was
the case for questions, an auxiliary must be generated.
Do-support is used. The rule used for do-support after
negation differs from the one used after wh -fronting.
They are presented this way for clarity, but could have
been combined into one rule.
SD: X - tense-V-no Y
1 2 3
SC: 1 do+2 3
Affix-hopping, as described above, hops the tense,
number, and negation from the verb to the auxiliary
verb. The cycle of transformations invoked thru
application of negation is completed with the
contraction transformation. The statement of the
contraction transformation is:
SD: X - do+tense -no - Y
2 3 4
SC: 1 #2+n&apos;t# 0 4
where # indicates that the result must be treated as a
unit for further transformations.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984392260869565">
The paraphraser described here is a syntactic one.
While this work has examined the reasons for different
forms of expression, additions must be made in the area
of semantics. The substitution of synonyms, phrases, or
idioms for portions or all of the question requires an
examination of the effect of context on word meaning and
of the intentions of the speaker on word or phrase
choice. The lack of a rich semantic base and contextual
information dictated the syntactic approach used here,
but the paraphraser can be extended once a wider range
of information becomes available.
The CO-OP paraphraser has been designed to be
domain-independent and thus a change of the database
requires no changes in the paraphraser. Paraphrasers
which use the template form however, will require such
changes. This is because the templates or patterns,
which constitute the type of question that can be asked,
are necessarily dependent on the domain. For different
databases, a different set of templates must he used.
The CO-OP paraphraser also differs from other systems in
that it generates the question using a transformational
grammar of questions. It addresses two specific
problems involved in generating paraphrases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.66905325">
1. ambiguity in determining which noun phrases a
relative clause modifies
2. the production of a question that differs from
the user&apos;s
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995307">
These goals have been achieved for questions using
relative clauses through the application of a theory of
given and new information to the generation process.
