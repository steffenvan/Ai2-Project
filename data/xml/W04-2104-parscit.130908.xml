Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999855583333333">
Lexical resources are key components for
applications related to human language technology.
Various models of lexical resources have been
designed and implemented during the last twenty
years and the scientific community has now gained
enough experience to design a common standard at
an international level. This paper thus describes the
ongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF
(Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how it
can be concretely implemented for the design of an
on-line morphological resource for French in the
Morphalou project.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999804375">
Lexical resources play a crucial role in most
applications related to human language technology.
They may be used by both human readers and
automatic processors for a wide range of activities
that require an even wider variety of lexical
structures. Some applications may demand broad
linguistic coverage, where the word is the entry
point and all the possible senses are attached to
them, whereas other applications could require a
concept-based organization of the lexical data,
from which the relevant words (or terms) may be
derived. Some applications barely need more then
a simple list of words, whereas other may require a
precise morpho-syntactic, syntactic and semantic
description of the various lexical entries.
Furthermore, the huge cost of creating and
maintaining a lexical resource in any of these
domains requires that they should not be designed
in isolation but that they may potentially be linked
with one another for mutual enrichment.
As a consequence, we believe that there is a
strong need for more widely accepted methods for
specifying lexical structures, so that the conditions
under which the corresponding databases can
exchange data are precisely defined. Moreover, it
seems that enough knowledge has been gathered
across the years to contemplate the idea that such
technical principles and methods could be the
source of an international standard that would
preserve the possibility of both describing various
types of formats and ensuring interoperability
among them.
This paper will present such a methodology as
currently under discussion in the context of ISO
committee TC 37/SC 4 in its on-going project
called LMF (Lexical Markup Framework, which
will become the future ISO 24613 standard). This
international context also provides us with a
unique opportunity to experiment with these most
recent proposals in the context of the concrete
necessity to deploy an open morphological
dictionary for French (the Morphalou project). We
will centre the discussion here on mapping the
modelling principles that have been agreed upon so
far in the LMF project with the actual requirements
associated with the design of a morphological
lexicon, hoping that it may lead to similar activities
on lexical modelling in the future.

2 Standards for lexical resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942038961039">
Before describing the ongoing standardization
efforts within the LMF project, it is essential to get
an idea of the actual background available to us in
lexical representation at large and see how LMF
may build upon, or rather receive input from, other
past or ongoing standardization activities.
Lexical structures can classically be viewed
according to the way they organize the relation
between words and senses: either senses are
considered as subdivisions of the lexical entry (the
semasiological view of lexical data, which is the
one usually applied in print dictionaries) or on the
contrary, it is assumed that words (or “terms”) are
described as ways of expressing a priori concepts,
(the onomasiological view).
The onomasiological view has formed the basis
for most previous standardization efforts since it is
at the focus of many applied contexts. This trend
started quite a while ago when the first standards
for thesaurus representation were issued in the
documentary field (ISO 2788 and ISO 5964).
Those standards basically organize lexical matter
as hierarchies of terms (e.g. broader-narrower
terms), with the possibility of adding some basic
lexical information (e.g. equivalences). More
recently, the terminological field has provided
more elaborate standards within ISO committee
TC 37, starting from the definition of an initial
SGML/XML-based representation for
terminologies (ISO 12200), and progressing on to
the design of a flexible platform for specifying
terminological structures (ISO 16642). The main
problem with the onomasiological view is that
even if it is well suited for providing homogeneous
lexical descriptions within an application domain,
it is hardly extensible when broader linguistic
coverage is required.
In contrast, the semasiological view allows an
exhaustive survey of lexical content for a given
language. In particular, it provides the basis for any
classical editorial (or print) dictionary, but the wide
variety of possible dictionary formats seems to
have hampered the development of international
standards in this domain. The two main initiatives
that can be cited here are on the one hand the ISO
1951 standard dedicated solely to the
representation of dictionary entries, and on the
other hand, the seminal work done within the TEI1
on print dictionaries, which, even though it has
already been applied to some large scale projects
such as the OED2, the Deutsches Wšrterbuch3 or
the Anglo-Norman dictionary4, has never been
considered by publishers in particular as a real
international standard. As a consequence, many
relevant projects such as the TLFi5 ( Dendien &amp;
Pierrel, 2003) have designed their own proprietary
structure for the description of their lexical
archives.
If one moves away from classical dictionaries
proper and considers lexical resources dedicated to
the domain of NLP, there are numerous projects
that have worked toward the definition of
standardized lexical structures in the domain of
NLP (Multext for basic morphological lexica;
Genelex, Simple, Isle/Mile for complex
multilingual entries; OLIF 1&amp;2 for translation
lexica, etc.), but none of them has lead to a
standard that reflects a wide international
consensus and that is effectively maintained by an
authoritative body.
From a more theoretical point of view, it has
been shown that such lexical structures can be
modelled as feature structures (Ide et alii, 1995;
Veronis &amp; Ide, 1992), leading to inheritance
properties within entries (Ide et alii, 2000), as
partially implemented in the TEI Print Dictionary
chapter (Ide &amp;Veronis, 1995). It has also been

shown that, with respect to describing the micro-
structure of such lexica, at least three
configurations are possible: 2-layered, 3-layered
and 7-layered models. In the 2-layered approach,
following Ferdinand de Saussure (1974), a word is
described by a signifier/signified pair, corres-
ponding to a morphological/semantic description.
The syntactic behaviour of the word is then
systematically attached to the semantic description.
This is the approach that has been retained for
LMF. In the 3-layer approach (Antoni-Lay et alii,
1994), a word is described by three units: a
morphological, a syntactic and a semantic unit as
in Genelex or Eagles. It should be noted that due to
the fact that the syntactic unit is a mandatory
connection between morphology and semantics,
such a model is necessarily heavy and complex. In
the 7-layered approach (Mel’cuk et alii, 1995), a
word is described by various units in surface
phonology, deep phonology, surface morphology,
deep morphology, surface syntax, deep syntax and
semantics. This approach imposes a heavy burden
on the lexical description task.
Let us stress here the necessity of guaranteeing
that the methods used to describe onomasiological
and semasiological structures shall not be
completely different, so that it is possible (as
required by industrial applications in particular) to
combine various kinds of lexical resources, but
also to open the way for lexical architectures to
combine concept-based and word-based
descriptions as evidenced in the EDR dictionary6,
the Papillon project7, or IBM’s TransLexis
resource.

<bodyText confidence="0.999976666666667">
The LMF proposal, as currently being developed
in ISO committee TC 37/SC 4, is conceived as a
generic platform for the specification of lexical
structures at any level of linguistic description. As
such, it does not provide one single model, but
rather a mechanism by which implementers com-
bine elementary lexical subsystems to design
models that can be both as close as possible to their
needs and comparable to any other lexical models
based on the same principles and, possibly, on the
same components.
The underlying data model for LMF follows the
general principles of the linguistic annotation
scheme design stated in Ide &amp; Romary, 2003 and
implemented in the context of ISO standard 16642
for the representation of terminological data
(Romary, 2001). Those principles provide a
mechanism for combining a given structural

metamodel that informs the general organization of
a certain level of linguistic information (morpho-
logy, syntax, etc.) with elementary descriptors (so-
called data categories). Data categories reflect
basic linguistic concepts (e.g. /part of speech/,
/grammatical number/, /paucal number/, etc.) and
allow for recording language-specific properties
independently of linguistic level specific models.
In order to share data categories within the
community, on-going work (in ISO/TC 37) is in
the process of deploying an on-line registry8 of
them, especially for use in conjunction with the
other standardization activities.
According to these principles, LMF consists of
the following elements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99322852631579">
• a core metamodel (i.e. the structural skeleton
shared by any linguistic description at the
lexical level);
• mechanisms for attaching lexical extensions
(see below) to the core metamodel in order to
build up more complex metamodels;
• mechanisms for selecting data categories used
for lexical description and for determining how
they relate to a metamodel;
• mechanisms for expressing any combination of
the core metamodel and data categories as
XML structures, i.e. by deciding to implement
a given data category (/gender/) as an XML
element rather than as an attribute and by
providing the corresponding vocabularies
(‘gen’, ‘gender’, ‘genre’);
• methods for describing how to extend LMF to
analyze, design, and describe a variety of more
specific lexical resources.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950795">
As shown in Figure 1, the core metamodel of
LMF is organized as a purely hierarchical structure
built upon the following components:
The Lexical database component gathers up all
information related to a given lexicon;
The Global information component groups
together all the metadata (e.g. version,
contributors, up-date, etc.) that can be globally
attached to the lexicon (see 4.4);
The Lexical entry component comprises the
elementary lexical unit in a lexical database. This
component can, of course, be iterated, but no
specific constraint is expressed as to its level of
granularity in a lexical database (e.g. proper
treatment of homonyms), since this depends highly
on languages and local editorial practices;
The Form component groups together all the
general graphical or phonetic descriptions attached
to the lexical entry (reference orthographic form,
transliteration, hyphenation, pronunciation, etc.);

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999591833333333">
Finally, the Sense component is the one that
actually organizes the lexical entry since it can be
both repeated and further subdivided into senses.
In a word-to-sense lexical structure, it is indeed
thought that this central way of organizing a lexical
entry should be part of the metamodel.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967740740741">
In order to specify more complex models than
would be expressible with just the core metamodel,
LMF introduces the notion of lexical extensions.
Those extensions correspond to clusters of com-
ponents dedicated to the representation of a
specific type of lexical information (e.g. morpho-
logy, syntactic constructions, transfer patterns
(socalled interlingua), and theory dependant lexi-
cographical approaches such as Mel’cuk et al.
1995 or V�ronis, 2000). Each lexical extension is
characterized by an anchor component, which is
either a component of the core metamodel or of
another lexical extension when more complex
combinations are being considered (e.g. descrip-
tion of morphological operations used to extend a
simple morphological lexical extension).
The future LMF standard as such should not
provide a specific list of data categories to be used
for lexical descriptions. This would by far be too
complex given, as we have seen, the potential
variety of applications. It is thus expected that
implementers will systematically refer to the
ISO/TC 37 data category registry to find the
adequate descriptive background for their own
purposes. Still, we can outline the basic types of
data categories that one could encounter in an LMF
based application, namely:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.886016">
• data categories that may be considered as
rather specific to the domain of lexical
description: these are typically those attached
to the Form component (/pronunciation/,

/etymology/, etc.). Some of these categories

The underlying lexical model of the Morphalou
project is a direct application of the LMF prince-
ples with the sole addendum of a simple lexical
extension dedicated to the description of morpho-
logy. This extension can be directly linked to the
lexical entry component of the core metamodel. It
associates a single morphological description
(Morphology component) to each lexical entry.
This morphological description is made up of two
sub-components:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9932015">
• a Paradigm component that refers to or
possibly describes the inflexion rules that
govern the flexional behaviour of the entry;
• an Inflexion component that groups together

lexical entry.

As stated in section 3, to build up a full model
for a concrete lexical database, one needs to
associate a selection of data categories anchored at
the different components of the metamodel (core
metamodel + morphological lexical extension).
To the Lexical entry component, we basically
associate to this component the data categories
/lemma/ and /grammatical category/. A /key form/
is used in order to uniquely identify the entry
within the lexical database. Possible orthographic
variants may be recorded as /spelling variant/’s.
Finally, depending on editorial choices, one could
also decide to attach /gender/ information here, for
example for nouns, in the case that gender
variation is not considered as inflexional variation,
as opposed to adjectives.
To the Inflexion component: beside /word form/,
which identifies the actual inflected form in the
component, it is necessary to associate the set of
morphological features to provide a unique
specification of the inflexion. The corresponding
data categories are complementary to the general
grammatical category of the entry: /gender/ and
/number/ for adjectives; /tense/, /person/, /number/
and /mood/ for verbs, etc. Appendix 1 provides a
complete list of the data categories we have
considered for the first version of the database;

respectively taking the values of chat, noun and
chat_1. The morphology component contains the
identification of the plural inflexion paradigm for
regular French nouns (/fr-s-plural/) and the
complete list of inflected word forms with
associated morphological features, i.e. /number/.

4.4 Integrating metadata descriptors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944931034482">
One important issue for the management, up-
dating and distribution of lexical databases is the
appropriate management of metadata, related either
to the identification of data sources or to the
characterization of the data.
Our proposal is based on several international
initiatives related to the definition of descriptors
for language data collections (cf. OLAC10,
IMDI11). We currently identify those descriptors
that may be relevant for lexical databases, such as
the language identifiers (ISO 16620) or the ‘roles’
defined in OLAC (depositor, developer, research-
er, annotator, sponsor, etc.). Concerning data
characterization, existing standards (ISO 16620)
also contain an inventory of possible useful des-
criptors related to the updating process (origination
date, input date, modification date, approval date,
withdrawal date, etc.).
Additional information should be more speci-
fically related to the morphological extension: One
could for example wish to keep track of morpho-
syntactic tags (relative to a given tagset, such as
Multext) currently used to refer to certain in-
flexions (see Example 6). Other useful metadata
would be information about testimony and fre-
quency of inflected forms in corpora, completeness
of an inflexion list (relevant for defective verbs
such as pleuvoir (‘to rain’) or indication of special
usages (diachronic, diatopic or diastratic variation).

graphical interface allows for lemmatization of a
given form and generation of all inflected forms
for a given lemma, whereas the XPath requests
allows for combining search criteria over any
combination of features and strings (for example,
all lexical entries for common nouns having an
inflected form containing the string aba). The next
steps are the development of a JAVA API and web
services to integrate search results directly into
NLP applications and the development of an
editorial line for efficient and coherent update of
the database. Preliminary updating experiments
based on freely accessible morphological databases
such as LEFFF and ABU13 are currently running
and reveal the most important problems to be
tackled (conversion of the input format, efficient
comparison of two XML files, linguistic validation
procedures and interfaces for submitted data,
fusion of lexical data).

<abstract confidence="0.979768153846154">Lexical resources are key components for applications related to human language technology. Various models of lexical resources have been designed and implemented during the last twenty years and the scientific community has now gained enough experience to design a common standard at an international level. This paper thus describes the ongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how it can be concretely implemented for the design of an on-line morphological resource for French in the Morphalou project.</abstract>

In order to integrate further data categories for the description of the inflexion rules, we still need to investigate linguistic practices for different language families. 4.3 Implementing the model: basic examples Example 1 implements, in a generic XML format (GMT, see Romary 2001), a simple lexical entry and its morphological extension for the French noun chat (‘cat’). The data categories associated with the lexical entry are /lemma/, /grammatical category/ and /key form/, respectively taking the values of chat, noun and chat_1. The morphology component contains the identification of the plural inflexion paradigm for regular French nouns (/fr-s-plural/) and the complete list of inflected word forms with associated morphological features, i.e. /number/.
