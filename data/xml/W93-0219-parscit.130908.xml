This paper briefly outlines observations from texts made with respect to rhetorical relations
and communicative goals. Then it will be shown how these observations have been encoded into
knowledge resources which are part of an integrated architecture for the generation of multimedia
output.
Both communicative goals and rhetorical relations are virtual constructs - surface signals hint
at their existence. hi the following we briefly discuss the various linguistic means by which both
rhetorical relations and communicative goals are signaled in texts.

Identification of Rhetorical Relations in Text

<bodyText confidence="0.991639">
For rhetorical relations surface signals are cue phrases like e.g. conjunctions. If no cue phrase
exists for a relation lexical cohesion may play that role.

Example 1: (Cue Phrase)
When a pathway is used several times in succession, the threshold falls.
Example 2: (Lexical Cohesion)

Water was all about them, was carrying them, was putting them down, was sinking,
was ebbing away.
In Example 1 the coNDtTioNality in the link between the two sentences is expressed by means
of the conjunction when. In example 2, on the contrary, the SEQUENCE ill the events reported is
implicit in the verbs which can be inferred as temporally linked. This example also shows how
a rhetorical relation contributes to the development of the topic and the progression of theme.
It can be observed, for instance, that the SEQUENCE relation preserves the theme over a chain
of events (on that point see also [Matthiessen and Bateman, &apos;91]).

The phenomena for which communicative goals are responsible are quite different. The effects
of a communicative goal on a text unit can best be observed when the text unit consists of
various sentences. These sentences usually share a number of features which can be considered
as characteristics of the goal at hand.

1. Sentences &amp;quot;belonging&amp;quot; to the same communicative goal are centered around a global (para-
graph) focus, which represents the overall topic of the text unit.
2. Text units corresponding to the same communicative goal can be characterized by the use
of a restricted set of rhetorical relations - this is one way how communicative goals and
rhetorical relations interact.
