Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999982125">
This paper presents the task definition, re-
sources, participation, and comparative re-
sults for the Web People Search task, which
was organized as part of the SemEval-2007
evaluation exercise. This task consists of
clustering a set of documents that mention
an ambiguous person name according to the
actual entities referred to using that name.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976232142857">
Finding information about people in the World Wide
Web is one of the most common activities of Internet
users. Person names, however, are highly ambigu-
ous. In most cases, the results for a person name
search are a mix of pages about different people
sharing the same name. The user is then forced ei-
ther to add terms to the query (probably losing recall
and focusing on one single aspect of the person), or
to browse every document in order to filter the infor-
mation about the person he is actually looking for.
In an ideal system the user would simply type a
person name, and receive search results clustered ac-
cording to the different people sharing that name.
And this is, in essence, the WePS (Web People
Search) task we have proposed to SemEval-2007
participants: systems receive a set of web pages
(which are the result of a web search for a per-
son name), and they have to cluster them in as
many sets as entities sharing the name. This task
has close links with Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD), which is generally formulated as the task
of deciding which sense a word has in a given con-
text. In both cases, the problem addressed is the res-
olution of the ambiguity in a natural language ex-
pression. A couple of differences make our prob-
lem different. WSD is usually focused on open-
class words (common nouns, adjectives, verbs and
adverbs). The first difference is that boundaries be-
tween word senses in a dictionary are often subtle
or even conflicting, making binary decisions harder
and sometimes even useless depending on the ap-
plication. In contrast, distinctions between people
should be easier to establish. The second difference
is that WSD usually operates with a dictionary con-
taining a relatively small number of senses that can
be assigned to each word. Our task is rather a case
of Word Sense Discrimination, because the number
of “senses” (actual people) is unknown a priori, and
it is in average much higher than in the WSD task
(there are 90,000 different names shared by 100 mil-
lion people according to the U.S. Census Bureau).
There is also a strong relation of our proposed
task with the Co-reference Resolution problem, fo-
cused on linking mentions (including pronouns) in
a text. Our task can be seen as a co-reference reso-
lution problem where the focus is on solving inter-
document co-reference, disregarding the linking of
all the mentions of an entity inside each document.
An early work in name disambiguation (Bagga
and Baldwin, 1998) uses the similarity between doc-
uments in a Vector Space using a “bag of words”
representation. An alternative approach by Mann
and Yarowsky (2003) is based on a rich feature space
of automatically extracted biographic information.

Following the general SemEval guidelines, we have
prepared trial, training and test data sets for the task,
which are described below.

2.1.1 Trial data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947166666667">
For this evaluation campaign we initially deliv-
ered a trial corpus for the potential participants. The
trial data consisted of an adapted version of the
WePS corpus described in (Artiles et al., 2006). The
predominant feature of this corpus is a high number
of entities in each document set, due to the fact that
the ambiguous names were extracted from the most
common names in the US Census. This corpus did
not completely match task specifications because it
did not consider documents with internal ambiguity,
nor it did consider non-person entities; but it was,
however, a cost-effective way of releasing data to
play around with. During the first weeks after releas-
ing this trial data to potential participants, some an-
notation mistakes were noticed. We preferred, how-
ever, to leave the corpus “as is” and concentrate our
efforts in producing clean training and test datasets,
rather than investing time in improving trial data.

In order to provide different ambiguity scenarios,
we selected person names from different sources:
US Census. We reused the Web03 corpus (Mann,
2006), which contains 32 names randomly picked
from the US Census, and was well suited for the
task.
Wikipedia. Another seven names were sampled
from a list of ambiguous person names in the En-
glish Wikipedia. These were expected to have a

few predominant entities (popular or historical), and
therefore a lower ambiguity than the previous set.
ECDL. Finally, ten additional names were ran-
domly selected from the Program Committee listing
of a Computer Science conference (ECDL 2006).
This set offers a scenario of potentially low am-
biguity (computer science scholars usually have a
stronger Internet presence than other professional
fields) with the added value of the a priori knowl-
edge of a domain specific type of entity (scholar)
present in the data.
All datasets consist of collections of web pages
obtained from the 100 top results for a person name
query to an Internet search engine 2. Note that 100
is an upper bound, because in some occasions the
URL returned by the search engine no longer exists.
The second and third datasets (developed explic-
itly for our task) consist of 17 person names and
1685 associated documents in total (99 documents
per name in average). Each web page was down-
loaded and stored for off-line processing. We also
stored the basic metadata associated to each search
result, including the original URL, title, position in
the results ranking and the corresponding snippet
generated by the search engine.
In the process of generating the corpus, the se-
lection of the names plays an important role, poten-
tially conditioning the degree of ambiguity that will
be found later in the Web search results. The reasons
for this variability in the ambiguity of names are di-
verse and do not always correlate with the straight-
forward census frequency. A much more decisive
feature is, for instance, the presence of famous en-
tities sharing the ambiguous name with less popular
people. As we are considering top search results,
these can easily be monopolized by a single entity
that is popular in the Internet.
After the annotation of this data (see section
2.1.4.) we found our predictions about the average
ambiguity of each dataset not to be completely ac-
curate. In Table 1 we see that the ECDL-06 average
ambiguity is indeed relatively low (except for the
documents for “Thomas Baker” standing as the most
ambiguous name in the whole training). Wikipedia
names have an average ambiguity of 23,14 entities

per name, which is higher than for the ECDL set.
The WEB03 Corpus has the lowest ambiguity (5,9
entities per name), for two reasons: first, randomly
picked names belong predominantly to the long tail
of unfrequent person names which, per se, have low
ambiguity. Being rare names implies that in average
there are fewer documents returned by the search en-
gine (47,20 per name), which also reduces the pos-
sibilities to find ambiguity.

2.1.3 Test data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984363636364">
For the test data we followed the same process
described for the training. In the name selection we
tried to maintain a similar distribution of ambigu-
ity degrees and scenario. For that reason we ran-
domly extracted 10 person names from the English
Wikipedia and another 10 names from participants
in the ACL-06 conference. In the case of the US cen-
sus names, we decided to focus on relatively com-
mon names, to avoid the problems explained above.
Unfortunately, after the annotation was finished
(once the submission deadline had expired), we
found a major increase in the ambiguity degrees (Ta-
ble 2) of all data sets. While we expected a raise in
the case of the US census names, the other two cases
just show that there is a high (and unpredictable)
variability, which would require much larger data
sets to have reliable population samples.
This has made the task particularly challenging
for participants, because naive learning strategies
(such as empirical adjustment of distance thresholds
to optimize standard clustering algorithms) might be
misleaded by the training set.

2.1.4 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937173913043">
The annotation of the data was performed sepa-
rately in each set of documents related to an ambigu-
ous name. Given this set of approximately 100 doc-
uments that mention the ambiguous name, the an-
notation consisted in the manual clustering of each
document according to the actual entity that is re-
ferred on it.
When non person entities were found (for in-
stance, organization or places named after a person)
the annotation was performed without any special
rule. Generally, the annotator browses documents
following the original ranking in the search results;
after reading a document he will decide whether the
mentions of the ambiguous name refer to a new en-
tity or to a entity previously identified. We asked
the annotators to concentrate first on mentions that
strictly contained the search string, and then to pay
attention to the co-referent variations of the name.
For instance “John Edward Fox” or “Edward Fox
Smith” would be valid mentions. “Edward J. Fox”,
however, breaks the original search string, and we
do not get into name variation detection, so it will
be considered valid only if it is co-referent to a valid

mention.
In order to perform the clustering, the annotator
was asked to pay attention to objective facts (bi-
ographical dates, related names, occupations, etc.)
and to be conservative when making decisions. The
final result is a complete clustering of the docu-
ments, where each cluster contains the documents
that refer to a particular entity. Following the pre-
vious example, in documents for the name “Edward
Fox” the annotator found 16 different entities with
that name. Note that there is no a priori knowledge
about the number of entities that will be discovered
in a document set. This makes the task specially
difficult when there are many different entities and
a high volume of scattered biographical information
to take into account.
In cases where the document does not offer
enough information to decide whether it belongs to
a cluster or is a new entity, it is discarded from the
evaluation process (not from the dataset). Another
common reason for discarding documents was the
absence of the person name in the document, usu-
ally due to a mismatch between the search engine
cache and the downloaded URL.
We found that, in many cases, different entities
were mentioned using the ambiguous name within a
single document. This was the case when a doc-
ument mentions relatives with names that contain
the ambiguous string (for instance “Edward Fox”
and “Edward Fox Jr.”). Another common case of
intra-document ambiguity is that of pages contain-
ing database search results, such as book lists from
Amazon, actors from IMDB, etc. A similar case is
that of pages that explicitly analyze the ambiguity of
a person name (Wikipedia “disambiguation” pages).
The way this situation was handled, in terms of the
annotation, was to assign each document to as many
clusters as entities were referred to on it with the
ambiguous name.

2.2 Evaluation measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999752">
Evaluation was performed in each document set
(web pages mentioning an ambiguous person name)
of the data distributed as test. The human annotation
was used as the gold standard for the evaluation.
Each system was evaluated using the standard pu-
rity and inverse purity clustering measures Purity is
related to the precision measure, well known in In-
formation Retrieval. This measure focuses on the
frequency of the most common category in each
cluster, and rewards the clustering solutions that in-
troduce less noise in each cluster. Being C the set
of clusters to be evaluated, L the set of categories
(manually annotated) and n the number of clustered
elements, purity is computed by taking the weighted
average of maximal precision values:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.453109">

<equation confidence="0.5858745">
Precision(Ci, Lj) = |Ci Lj|
|Ci|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9713742">
Inverse Purity focuses on the cluster with maxi-
mum recall for each category, rewarding the clus-
tering solutions that gathers more elements of each
category in a corresponding single cluster. Inverse
Purity is defined as:

<bodyText confidence="0.988310333333333">
For the final ranking of systems we used the har-
monic mean of purity and inverse purity Fα=0,s. The
F measure is defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.947147666666667">
1

Purity + (1 − α) Inverse Purity
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996545444444444">
Fα=0,2 is included as an additional measure giv-
ing more importance to the inverse purity aspect.
The rationale is that, for a search engine user, it
should be easier to discard a few incorrect web
pages in a cluster containing all the information
needed, than having to collect the relevant infor-
mation across many different clusters. Therefore,
achieving a high inverse purity should be rewarded
more than having high purity.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998925">
2.3 Baselines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999855">
Two simple baseline approaches were applied to the
test data. The ALL-IN-ONE baseline provides a
clustering solution where all the documents are as-
signed to a single cluster. This has the effect of al-
ways achieving the highest score in the inverse pu-
rity measure, because all classes have their docu-
ments in a single cluster. On the other hand, the
purity measure will be equal to the precision of the
predominant class in that single cluster. The ONE-
IN-ONE baseline gives another extreme clustering
solution, where every document is assigned to a dif-
ferent cluster. In this case purity always gives its
maximum value, while inverse purity will decrease
with larger classes.

2.4 Campaign design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999103030303">
The schedule for the evaluation campaign was set by
the SemEval organisation as follows: (i) release task
description and trial data set; (ii) release of training
and test; (iii) participants send their answers to the
task organizers; (iv) the task organizers evaluate the
answers and send the results.
The task description and the initial trial data set
were publicly released before the start of the official
evaluation.
The official evaluation period started with the si-
multaneous release of both training and test data, to-
gether with a scoring script with the main evaluation
measures to be used. This period spanned five weeks
in which teams were allowed to register and down-
load the data. During that period, results for a given
task had to be submitted no later than 21 days af-
ter downloading the training data and no later than 7
days after downloading the test data. Only one sub-
mission per team was allowed.
Training data included the downloaded web
pages, their associated metadata and the human clus-
tering of each document set, providing a develop-
ment test-bed for the participant’s systems. We also
specified the source of each ambiguous name in the
training data (Wikipedia, ECDL conference and US
Census). Test data only included the downloaded
web pages and their metadata. This section of the
corpus was used for the systems evaluation. Partici-
pants were required to send a clustering for each test
document set.
Finally, after the evaluation period was finished
and all the participants sent their data, the task orga-
nizers sent the evaluation for the test data.

ticipant systems, the average value for the ranking
measure was 0, 60 and its standard deviation 0, 11.
Results with Fα=0,2 are not substantially different
(except for the two baselines, which roughly swap
positions). There are some ranking swaps, but gen-
erally only within close pairs.
The good performance of the ONE-IN-ONE base-
line system is indicative of the abundance of single-
ton entities (entities represented by only one doc-
ument). This situation increases the inverse purity
score for this system giving a harmonic measure
higher than the expected.

The WEPS task ended with considerable success in
terms of participation, and we believe that a careful
analysis of the contributions made by participants
(which is not possible at the time of writing this re-
port) will be an interesting reference for future re-
search. In addition, all the collected and annotated

At the same time, it is clear that building a re-
liable test-bed for the task is not simple. First of
all, the variability across test cases is large and un-
predictable, and a system that works well with the

names in our test bed may not be reliable in practi-
cal, open search situations. Partly because of that,
our test-bed happened to be unintentionally chal-
lenging for systems, with a large difference be-
tween the average ambiguity in the training and test
datasets. Secondly, it is probably necessary to think
about specific evaluation measures beyond standard
clustering metrics such as purity and inverse purity,
which are not tailored to the task and do not be-
have well when multiple classification is allowed.
We hope to address these problems in a forthcom-
ing edition of the WEPS task.

During the first weeks after releasing this trial data to potential participants, some annotation mistakes were noticed. We preferred, however, to leave the corpus “as is” and concentrate our efforts in producing clean training and test datasets, rather than investing time in improving trial data. 2.1.2 Training data In order to provide different ambiguity scenarios, we selected person names from different sources: US Census. We reused the Web03 corpus (Mann, 2006), which contains 32 names randomly picked from the US Census, and was well suited for the task. Wikipedia.
