This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the ACL02 Workshop on Speech-
to-Speech Translation, held at the University of Philadelphia on July 11, 2002 in parallel with the
ACL02 conference.
We solicited papers from researchers from all over the world working on different approaches to
the speech translation problem. We looked for papers that would demonstrate the current state-of-
the-art in the field; describe various application settings, and expose some of the challenges that still
lie before the community. We were impressed by the quality and breadth of coverage of the papers
submitted to the workshop. The published papers reflect a balanced mix of theory and practice.
In addition to the papers, the workshop also features an invited paper by Dr. Eiichiro Sumita
from ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories and a panel discussion. The panel
discussion brings together leaders and policy makers from academia, industry and government
to discuss future research directions required by real world application difficulities. We thank
our panelists, Drs. Tim Anderson, Jim Bass, Melissa Holland, Gianni Lazzari, David Nahamoo,
Giuseppe Riccardi, Nino Varile, Alex Waibel and Seiichi Yamamoto, for their participation.
Organizing a workshop like this is not an easy affair. Luckily, we had an excellent crew on
board. Our program committee members Hakan Erdogan, Michael Picheny, Seiichi Yamamoto,
Gianni Lazzari and Taiyi Huang gave their valuable time and expertise to help us with the
organization and paper reviews. Among the submissions, the reviewers selected the papers in this
proceedings in a double-blind refereeing process. We deeply and sincerely thank all who reviewed.
It would have been impossible to finish the process timely without their help.
This workshop would not have been possible without the support of the workshop chair Walter
Daelemans. We most gratefully acknowledge his support as well as the efforts of the publication
chair Dragomir Radev, the program chairs Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and all other ACL02
organizers.
