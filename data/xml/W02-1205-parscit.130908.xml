The Open Language Archives Community
(OLAC, http://www.language-archives.org) is
an international partnership of institutions and
individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual
library of language resources by: (1) developing
consensus on best current practices for the
digital archiving of language resources; (2)
developing a network of interoperating
repositories and services for housing and
accessing such resources.
Three primary standards are the foundational
basis of the OLAC infrastructure that serve to
bridge the multiple gaps which now lie in
between language resources and users:
(1)OLACMS: the OLAC Metadata Set
(Qualified DC, Dublin Core), (2) OLAC MHP:
refinements to the OAI (Open Archives
Initiative, http://www.openarchives.org) protocol,
and (3) OLAC Process: a procedure for
identifying Best Common Practice
Recommendations.

It is crucial to note that the OLAC standards are
not standards for the language resources
community alone. They are based on two
broadly accepted standards in the digital
archives community. First, the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is an open forum
engaged in the development of interoperable
online metadata standards that support a broad
range of purposes and business models. There
are fifteen Doblin Core Metadata Elements
(DCMS) and their qualifiers. OLACMS extends
the DC minimally to anwer the needs of the
language archives community (Bird, Simons,
and Huang 2001).
Second, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was
launched in October 1999 to provide a common
framework across electronic preprint archives,
and it has since been broadened to include
digital repositories of scholarly materials
regardless of their type. The OAI infrastructure
requires compliance with two standards: the
OAI Shared Metadata Set (i.e. DCMS), and the
OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol (MHP). The
OAI MHP allows software services to query a
repository using HTTP requests, also an
important feature of the recently hyped Semantic
Web (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/). Using the
OAI infrastructure, the community&apos;s archives
can be federated and become a virtual
meta-archive collecting all available information.
The federeated structure allows end-users to
query multiple archives simultaneously.
Currently, the Linguistic Data Consortium has
harvested the catalogs of over 20 participating
archives on behalf of OLAC, and created a
search interface which permits queries over all
30,000+ records. A single search typically
returns records from multiple archives. The
prototype can be accessed via the OLAC
website.
In this paper, we trace the version changes of
OLACMS, especially in comparison with other
(often related) international standards. We will
then concentrate on the application of OLACMS
to Chinese language resources. In conclusion,
we will make some suggestions for OLACMS to
account for the characteristics of Chinese
language archives.

2 Mapping with other international
standards

2.1.Mapping with IMDI
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858197368421">
ISLE Meta Data Initiative (IMDI) is a cousin of
OLACMS. IMDI proposes a metadata set for
natural language processing under the broader
International Standards for Language
Engineering (ISLE) project. ISLE is
co-sponsored by the European Commission of
the EU and National Science Foundation of the
USA. It aims to develop a set of internationally
accepted standards for natural language
processing base on the result of the earlier
European standard building project (EAGLES,
http://www.ilc.pi.cnr.it/EAGLES96/home.html).
On one hand, IMDI is an elaboration of
OLACMS since it deals specifically with
recording sessions. They can also be considered
a complimenting each other since they are both
devised under the aegis of ISLE.
IMDI Metadata Elements for Session
Descriptions, Version 2.5 was completed in June
2001. The elements evolved from the previous
EAGLES metadata set described in Wittenburg
et al. (2000). Both metadata sets share the aim to
improve the accessibility/availability of
Language Resources (LR) on the Internet. To
achieve this goal, they created a browsable and
searchable universe of meta-descriptions similar
to those devised by other communities on the
Internet.
The focus on Session Description was motivated
in Broeder et al. (2000). They observed that
individual linguistic resource usually exists in
clusters of related resources. For instance, a field
video recording of an informant who describes a
picture sequence involves several resources. By
his definition, an (linguistic) event that called a
session is the top element and there results a
number of related linguistic resources: Video
tape, Photographs, Digitised video file, Digitised
photographs, Digitisations of the images used as
stimuli, One electronic transcription file, One or
more electronic analysis files, Field notes and
experiment descriptions (in electronic form).
However, since not all linguistic resources come
to existence directly through sessions, hence not
all linguistic resources can be described by
IMDI.2
In principle, IMDI metadata can be mapped to
OLAC metadata, just as OLAC metadata can be
mapped to DC. IMDI Team (August 2001)
mapped IMDI Session Descriptions with OLAC
0.3 Version. IMDI Team also use existing
description formalisms used by institutions that
deal with “published corpora” such as [ELRA]
and [LDC]. The set of metadata elements that
describe “published corpora” are called
“catalogue” metadata elements. The IMDI Team
(Gibbon, et al. 2001) launched IMDI Metadata
Elements for Catalogue Descriptions, Version
2.1. It also includes Metadata Elements for
Lexicon Descriptions.
OLACMS has been updated since December
2001. Hence we did an updated comparison and
present the result in this section. Note that since
IMDI is an elaboration of OLACMS, we
concentrate on the IMDI elements that are not
specified in OLACMS and are likely to find
wider application. Please note that the section
contains our own recommendations inspired by
the IMDI/OLAC comparison. We try to add our
motivation even for the items that are directly
adopted from IMDI. In terms of OLAC scheme,
these suggested revision/addition can be
assigned the status of attributes (for use by
sub-communities), and can be incorporated into
the OLACMS later if the community find such
addition necessary.

2.1.1. Controlled Vocabulary

Controlled vocabulary defines the basic concepts
of the metadata set and any addition to the
controlled vocabulary should be motivated by

the essentiality of the concept.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98842395">
• Controlled Vocabulary for Logical
Structure of linguistic resources: Language
resources come in different forms and
various units. A critical piece of information
in cataloguing language resource is a
description of the composition of the
resources. For instance, any English lexicon
can be conventionally and naturally viewed
as composed of 26 sections defined by
shared initial alphabet. Having an element of
Logical Structure: alphabetically ordered
would give us vital information of how to
manipulate the resource. Other vocabularies
such as ‘sequential chapter’, ‘dialogue turns’,
or ‘sequential phonemes’ would also offer
crucial information. In addiiton, if sequential
database is indeed the future of language
resources, the description of the sequencing
logic will play an essential role.

annotator, we do not refer to the natural
person or an automatic program who puts
the tags on. By annotator we refer to the
institution that implemented the annotation.
This information is crucial since this
annotator 1) has at least partial IP right on
the resource; 2) often set/defines the tagset
standard adopted (e.g. Brown, LOB, Penn
TreeBank). In other words, annotator can
differentiate a new version of resource or
even identify totally new resource.

One existing elements may need further refining
with existing mechanisms.
• Refining the element Project: Many
language resources are developed under or
partially supported by a project grant. For
now, a project can be the value of Creator or
Contributor. But just like all other individual
creators and contributors, a project needs to
be described in fuller details. We need to use
attributes to describe the Founder, PI’s, Host
Institutes, etc. of a project. An umbrella
project, such as EAGLES, ISLE, or at a even
more complex level, ESPRIT, requires
elaboration of contributors and funding
timelines themselves.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943532571428571">
2.1.3. Updating and Revising the Attributes
• Add sub type to the Space attribute :
Coverage of the language resources often
calls for geographical information. Hence
we need to define the subtypes that include
Continent, Country, Administrative division,
longitude, latitude, address, etc.
• Add subtype for non-standard Identifier :
There are many sets of identifers are defined
locally and do not follow URL. In this case,
we can add the name of the identifier system
(or cataloguer) under schme. For instance,
each libary often has its own set of call
numbers. Other well-known identifiers arre
LCC Catalog No (&lt;Identifier
sceeme=&amp;quot;LCC&amp;quot;&gt; LCC Catalog
No&lt;/Identifier&gt;). This could also apply to
well-established identifiers such as ISSN and
ISBN.
• Although OLAC:Format does not stipulate
any refine attributes, however, it is already
stipulated in DC:Format. The DC format
refine has two control vocabulary entries:
Medium specifies the material that the
cataloguer uses; while extent records size
and duration of the archive. We suggest that
OLAC can simply adopt these two refine
attributes.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.8790795">
2.2.Mapping with Linguistic
Documentation Archives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994623745454545">
In addition to IMDI Metadata, Gary Holton
(2000) also proposes a system of metadata for
the description of language documentation
resources following OLACMS. While the
system described here should be sufficient for
any linguistic resource, it is motivated by the
specific ongoing need to describe linguistic
documentation materials contained in the Alaska
Native Language Center (ANLC) Archive.
Particular attention is paid to description of
first-hand documentation materials such as field
notes, grammatical notes, and phonological
descriptions, many of which currently exist only
in written form. Existing resources are in the
process of being digitized, and new digital
resources continue to be acquired. The ANLC
collection presently contains more than ten
thousand items. While much of the material
consists of original manuscripts of archival
quality, the collection also includes published
materials and materials existing in other archival
collections, duplicated in whole or in part. The
ANLC Archive thus combines both archival and
library functions.
The unique need described in Holton (2000) is
that he wants the Metadata set to be applied
simultaneously to non-digital archives, such as
manuscript, reel-to-reel cassettes, CD recordings
etc. This can be done by adopting the
DC:Format refine attribute of Medium. In order
to descibe the archives more felicitously, we
also need to add speaker, interviewer Holder,
and Guardian to the value of controlled
vocabulary of refine of Creator and Contributor.
However, there does not seem to be any
straightforward way to transfer Target Dialect.
2.3.Summary
Based on the two comparison of different
metadata sets, we found that the DC qualifier
can be applied effectively to solve the bridging
and conversion problems between different
DC-based extension metadata sets. This should
be exactly what OLACMS design has in mind.
The attributes that were not stipulated in
OLACMS 0.4, if found in DC and motivated by
actual need to describe language resources, can
be easily adopted. One way to ensure the
versatility is to keep all DC attribute in
OLACMS, even though some of the attributes
may be dormant and not actively applied now.
Another issue worth noting is that any
cataloguer may add sub-elements to achive more
comprehensive description. However, such
addition should, follow the extension and
adaptability of the DC.

3 Use Controlled Vocabulary for
Temporal and Geographic Location
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998422529411765">
Constable, and Simons (2000) listed all the
causes for language changes, which basically
involve the change in the temporal-spatial
location of the poeple. Since China used a
different calendar system until late in early 20th
century, all inherent temporal description of
inherited Chinese archives do not conform to the
current DC standard. In order to identify
Western and Chinese chronology, we may
stipulate that the primary types of the scheme
element to be Western (W_Calendar) or Chinese
(C_Calendar). We may also add other
chronological methods, such as lunar or solar
calendar. The sub_type of Chinese calendar will
then include time, dynasty name, state name,
emperor’s reign, and the reign name of the
emperor. Take the Academia Sinica Ancient
Chinese Corpus for example. Its coverage is
Early Mandarin Chinese, and will marked as
such in the metadata: &lt;Coverage
scheme=&amp;quot;C_calendar/phase&amp;quot;&gt;EarlyMandarin
&lt;/Coverage&gt;. The users will be able to refer to a
historical linguistic calendar and find that the
time equals to the dynasties of Yuan, Ming, and
Ching. And will be able to convert the time to
western calendar using the conversion table of
[Sinica Calendar].
When Coverage has a spatial refinement, a
location can have different names because of the
unit used in cataloguing, as well as because of
temporal or regional and linguistic variaions.
Hence, the spatial value of Coverage must be
defined by a scheme. A scheme must stipulate
temporal reference as unit of catalogue. For
instance, the Sinica Corpus covers the language
of the Republica of China in Taiwan. Its
metadata will have the following value
&lt;Coverage refine= &amp;quot;spatial&amp;quot; scheme=
&amp;quot;ROC/Taiwan&amp;quot;&gt;. As mentioned above [Sinica
Calendar] offers conversion table for the past
2000 years between Chinese and Western
calendars. As for the units for cataloguing of
spatial location, OLAC 0.4 Version adopts
[TGN]( Getty Thesaurus of Geographical
Terms). And many other digital archives follow
Alexandria Digital Library Feature Type
Thesaurus [ADL]. The ADL type thesaurus have
been adopted by the digital archives project in
Taiwan and translated into Chinese by
Academia Sinica Metadata Architecture and
Application Team [Sinica MAAT].

4 Applying OLACMS to Language
Archives in Taiwan

<bodyText confidence="0.9997525">
Each text in Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus
of Modern Chinese (Sinica Corpus) is marked
up with five textual parameters: Mode, Genre,
Style, Topic and Medium. These are important
textual information that needs to be catalogued
in metadata. The following shows how we
transfer and represent these (legacy) textual
information to OLACMS:

We add a refine attribute under Type. Mode is
added in the controlled vocabulary as Primary
type, and Genre is added as sub type. For
instance, a recorded and transcribed speech is
catalogued as &lt;Type code=&amp;quot;Sound&amp;quot;
refine=&amp;quot;spoken-to-be-written/Speech&amp;quot;/&gt;.
4.2.Style
There are four styles that are differentiated in
Sinica Corpus: Narrative, Argumentative,
Expository, and Descriptive. We add a new
refine attirbute under Descriptio, with Style as a
controlled vocabulary. For instance, a diary will
be catalogued as: &lt;Description refine=&amp;quot;Style&amp;quot;&gt;
Narration &lt;/Description&gt;.
language reources as: Newspaper, General
Magazine, Academic Journal, Textbook,
Reference Book, Thesis, General Book,

quick and drastic changes. In order to

coverage, this set of controlled vocabulary
must be open and allows each participant to
register, subject to the approval by OLAC.

5 Language Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901656716418">
Constable and Simons (2000) noted that a
computer, unlike human beings, cannot
automatically identify the language of a text that
it is reading yet. Hence metadata must play a
central role in identifying the language that each
resource uses. For instance, Malay and English
uses the same 26 letters. And Archaic Chinese
2000 years ago and Modern Mandarin can be
expressed by pretty much the same set of
Chinese characters. These are all different
languages and need to be identified before a
language resource can be used. SIL (Summer
Institute of Linguistics, in its white-paper
identified five major issues for language
identification: Change, Categorization,
Inadequate definition, Scale, and Documentation.
SIL has produced an online searchable database:
Ethnologue that provides a comprehensive
system of language identification covering more
than 6,800 languages. This is adopted by OLAC
as an obvious improvement over the very small
set covered in DC.
Bird et al. (2001), however, pointed out some
problems of coverage if the Enthlogue system is
adapted without further means of enrichment.
The three broad categories of problem are:
over-splitting, over-chunking and omission.
Over-splitting occurs when a language variety is
treated as a distinct language. For example,
Nataoran is given its own language code (AIS)
even though the scholars at Academia Sinica
consider it to be a dialect of Amis (ALV).
Over-chunking occurs when two distinct
languages are treated as dialects of a single
language (there does not appear to be an
example of this in the Ethnologue&apos;s treatment of
Formosan languages). Omission occurs when a
language is not listed. For example, two extinct
languages, Luilang and Quaquat, are not listed in
the Ethnologue. Another kind of omission
problem occurs when the language is actually
listed, but the name by which the archivist
knows it is not listed, whether as a primary name
or an alternate name. In such a case the archivist
cannot make the match to assign the proper code.
For instance, the language listed as Taroko
(TRV) in the Ethnologue is known as Seediq by
Academia Sinica; several of the alternate names
listed by the Ethnologue are similar, but none
matches exactly.
The above problems may prove to be a
stumbling block for archives that attempt to
integrate linguistic resources with GIS
(Geographic Information System), such as the
[Formosan Language Archive] at Academia
Sinica. A GIS-based language atlas will most
likely be very concerned with fine-grained
changes and variations among languages and
dialects within a geographic area. In other words,
these kind of archives may either discover yet
unrecorded language or sub-language
differentiations or need even finer classification
in Ethnologue or any language identification
system. Hence the solution proposed in Bird et
al. (2001) of allowing local language
classification systems to register must be
implemented under OLAC.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980115384615">
We looked at a couple of OLAC derived
metadatasets, as well as applied OLAC version
0.4. to three different language archives in
Taiwan. We proposed some suggestions for
enriching of OLACMS based on the study.
There are two general directions to bear in mind.
First, as the number and complexity of language
resources becomes higher and higher, the need
to have a uniform standard or to easy access to
the owner of each resource becomes even
greater. Therefore, we envision that the element
of Creator, Contributor etc. needs further
elaboration, which may include practical
information such as email addresses etc. Second,
as the language archives get richer, the need to
note language variation grows even bigger.
Simple language identification of allotting a
resource a unique language code is not enough.
There will be great need to infer linguistic
relations from these codes. Since it is impossible
to build a complete reportiore of resources for
all languages, it is very often that a resources
from the closest related language must be
borrowed. The representation of linguistic
relations will be the next challenge of language
identification.

<abstract confidence="0.995062916666666">OLACMS (stands for Open Language Archives Community Metadata Set) is a standard for describe language resources. This paper provides suggestion to OLACMS 0.4 version by comparing it with other standards and applying it to Chinese and Formosan languages. The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC, http://www.language-archives.org) is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (1) developing consensus on best current practices for the digital archiving of language resources; (2) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources. Three primary standards are the foundational basis of the OLAC infrastructure that serve to bridge the multiple gaps which now lie in between language resources and users: (1)OLACMS: the OLAC Metadata Set (Qualified DC, Dublin Core), (2) OLAC MHP: refinements to the OAI (Open Archives protocol, and (3) OLAC Process: a procedure for identifying Best Common Practice Recommendations. are indebted to Steven Bird and reviewers of the 3rd Workshop on Asian Language Resources and International Standardization for their valuable comments and corrections. Colleagues of the Language Archives project at Academia Sinica provided data and suggestions. Any remaining errors are ours.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.993446642642643">It is crucial to note that the OLAC standards are not standards for the language resources community alone. They are based on two broadly accepted standards in the digital archives community. First, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is an open forum engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. There are fifteen Doblin Core Metadata Elements (DCMS) and their qualifiers. OLACMS extends the DC minimally to anwer the needs of the language archives community (Bird, Simons, and Huang 2001). Second, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was launched in October 1999 to provide a common framework across electronic preprint archives, and it has since been broadened to include digital repositories of scholarly materials regardless of their type. The OAI infrastructure requires compliance with two standards: the OAI Shared Metadata Set (i.e. DCMS), and the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol (MHP). The OAI MHP allows software services to query a repository using HTTP requests, also an important feature of the recently hyped Semantic Using the OAI infrastructure, the community&apos;s archives can be federated and become a virtual meta-archive collecting all available information. The federeated structure allows end-users to query multiple archives simultaneously. Currently, the Linguistic Data Consortium has harvested the catalogs of over 20 participating archives on behalf of OLAC, and created a search interface which permits queries over all 30,000+ records. A single search typically returns records from multiple archives. The prototype can be accessed via the OLAC website. In this paper, we trace the version changes of OLACMS, especially in comparison with other (often related) international standards. We will then concentrate on the application of OLACMS to Chinese language resources. In conclusion, we will make some suggestions for OLACMS to account for the characteristics of Chinese language archives. 2 Mapping with other international standards 2.1.Mapping with IMDI ISLE Meta Data Initiative (IMDI) is a cousin of OLACMS. IMDI proposes a metadata set for natural language processing under the broader International Standards for Language Engineering (ISLE) project. ISLE is co-sponsored by the European Commission of the EU and National Science Foundation of the USA. It aims to develop a set of internationally accepted standards for natural language processing base on the result of the earlier European standard building project (EAGLES, http://www.ilc.pi.cnr.it/EAGLES96/home.html). On one hand, IMDI is an elaboration of OLACMS since it deals specifically with recording sessions. They can also be considered a complimenting each other since they are both devised under the aegis of ISLE. IMDI Metadata Elements for Session Descriptions, Version 2.5 was completed in June 2001. The elements evolved from the previous EAGLES metadata set described in Wittenburg et al. (2000). Both metadata sets share the aim to improve the accessibility/availability of Language Resources (LR) on the Internet. To achieve this goal, they created a browsable and searchable universe of meta-descriptions similar to those devised by other communities on the Internet. The focus on Session Description was motivated in Broeder et al. (2000). They observed that individual linguistic resource usually exists in clusters of related resources. For instance, a field video recording of an informant who describes a picture sequence involves several resources. By his definition, an (linguistic) event that called a session is the top element and there results a number of related linguistic resources: Video tape, Photographs, Digitised video file, Digitised photographs, Digitisations of the images used as stimuli, One electronic transcription file, One or more electronic analysis files, Field notes and experiment descriptions (in electronic form). However, since not all linguistic resources come to existence directly through sessions, hence not all linguistic resources can be described by In principle, IMDI metadata can be mapped to OLAC metadata, just as OLAC metadata can be mapped to DC. IMDI Team (August 2001) mapped IMDI Session Descriptions with OLAC 0.3 Version. IMDI Team also use existing description formalisms used by institutions that deal with “published corpora” such as [ELRA] and [LDC]. The set of metadata elements that describe “published corpora” are called “catalogue” metadata elements. The IMDI Team (Gibbon, et al. 2001) launched IMDI Metadata Elements for Catalogue Descriptions, Version 2.1. It also includes Metadata Elements for Lexicon Descriptions. OLACMS has been updated since December 2001. Hence we did an updated comparison and present the result in this section. Note that since IMDI is an elaboration of OLACMS, we concentrate on the IMDI elements that are not specified in OLACMS and are likely to find wider application. Please note that the section contains our own recommendations inspired by the IMDI/OLAC comparison. We try to add our motivation even for the items that are directly adopted from IMDI. In terms of OLAC scheme, these suggested revision/addition can be assigned the status of attributes (for use by sub-communities), and can be incorporated into the OLACMS later if the community find such addition necessary. 2.1.1. Controlled Vocabulary Controlled vocabulary defines the basic concepts of the metadata set and any addition to the controlled vocabulary should be motivated by is possible to conceive language resources such as lexica and grammars as created through a very large set of (non-planned and non-documented) sessions. But this consideration is beyond the scope of this paper and will not be pursued further here. the essentiality of the concept. Controlled Vocabulary for linguistic Language resources come in different forms and various units. A critical piece of information in cataloguing language resource is a description of the composition of the resources. For instance, any English lexicon can be conventionally and naturally viewed as composed of 26 sections defined by shared initial alphabet. Having an element of Logical Structure: alphabetically ordered would give us vital information of how to manipulate the resource. Other vocabularies such as ‘sequential chapter’, ‘dialogue turns’, or ‘sequential phonemes’ would also offer crucial information. In addiiton, if sequential database is indeed the future of language resources, the description of the sequencing logic will play an essential role. • Add Annotator to [OLAC–Role]. By annotator, we do not refer to the natural person or an automatic program who puts the tags on. By annotator we refer to the institution that implemented the annotation. This information is crucial since this annotator 1) has at least partial IP right on the resource; 2) often set/defines the tagset standard adopted (e.g. Brown, LOB, Penn TreeBank). In other words, annotator can differentiate a new version of resource or even identify totally new resource. • Add values of archiving Quality to the refine controlled vocabulary of Format. 2.1.2. Elements One existing elements may need further refining with existing mechanisms. • Refining the element Project: Many language resources are developed under or partially supported by a project grant. For now, a project can be the value of Creator or Contributor. But just like all other individual creators and contributors, a project needs to be described in fuller details. We need to use attributes to describe the Founder, PI’s, Host Institutes, etc. of a project. An umbrella project, such as EAGLES, ISLE, or at a even more complex level, ESPRIT, requires elaboration of contributors and funding timelines themselves. 2.1.3. Updating and Revising the Attributes • Add sub type to the Space attribute : Coverage of the language resources often calls for geographical information. Hence we need to define the subtypes that include Continent, Country, Administrative division, longitude, latitude, address, etc. • Add subtype for non-standard Identifier : There are many sets of identifers are defined locally and do not follow URL. In this case, we can add the name of the identifier system (or cataloguer) under schme. For instance, each libary often has its own set of call numbers. Other well-known identifiers arre LCC Catalog No (&lt;Identifier sceeme=&amp;quot;LCC&amp;quot;&gt; LCC No&lt;/Identifier&gt;). This could also apply to well-established identifiers such as ISSN and ISBN. • Although OLAC:Format does not stipulate any refine attributes, however, it is already stipulated in DC:Format. The DC format refine has two control vocabulary entries: Medium specifies the material that the cataloguer uses; while extent records size and duration of the archive. We suggest that OLAC can simply adopt these two refine attributes. 2.2.Mapping with Linguistic Documentation Archives In addition to IMDI Metadata, Gary Holton (2000) also proposes a system of metadata for the description of language documentation resources following OLACMS. While the system described here should be sufficient for any linguistic resource, it is motivated by the specific ongoing need to describe linguistic documentation materials contained in the Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC) Archive. Particular attention is paid to description of first-hand documentation materials such as field notes, grammatical notes, and phonological descriptions, many of which currently exist only in written form. Existing resources are in the process of being digitized, and new digital resources continue to be acquired. The ANLC collection presently contains more than ten thousand items. While much of the material consists of original manuscripts of archival quality, the collection also includes published materials and materials existing in other archival collections, duplicated in whole or in part. The ANLC Archive thus combines both archival and library functions. The unique need described in Holton (2000) is that he wants the Metadata set to be applied simultaneously to non-digital archives, such as manuscript, reel-to-reel cassettes, CD recordings etc. This can be done by adopting the DC:Format refine attribute of Medium. In order to descibe the archives more felicitously, we also need to add speaker, interviewer Holder, and Guardian to the value of controlled vocabulary of refine of Creator and Contributor. However, there does not seem to be any straightforward way to transfer Target Dialect. 2.3.Summary Based on the two comparison of different metadata sets, we found that the DC qualifier can be applied effectively to solve the bridging and conversion problems between different DC-based extension metadata sets. This should be exactly what OLACMS design has in mind. The attributes that were not stipulated in OLACMS 0.4, if found in DC and motivated by actual need to describe language resources, can be easily adopted. One way to ensure the versatility is to keep all DC attribute in OLACMS, even though some of the attributes may be dormant and not actively applied now. Another issue worth noting is that any cataloguer may add sub-elements to achive more comprehensive description. However, such addition should, follow the extension and adaptability of the DC. 3 Use Controlled Vocabulary for Temporal and Geographic Location Constable, and Simons (2000) listed all the causes for language changes, which basically involve the change in the temporal-spatial location of the poeple. Since China used a calendar system until late in early century, all inherent temporal description of inherited Chinese archives do not conform to the current DC standard. In order to identify Western and Chinese chronology, we may stipulate that the primary types of the scheme element to be Western (W_Calendar) or Chinese (C_Calendar). We may also add other chronological methods, such as lunar or solar calendar. The sub_type of Chinese calendar will then include time, dynasty name, state name, emperor’s reign, and the reign name of the emperor. Take the Academia Sinica Ancient Chinese Corpus for example. Its coverage is Early Mandarin Chinese, and will marked as such in the metadata: &lt;Coverage &lt;/Coverage&gt;. The users will be able to refer to a historical linguistic calendar and find that the time equals to the dynasties of Yuan, Ming, and Ching. And will be able to convert the time to western calendar using the conversion table of [Sinica Calendar]. When Coverage has a spatial refinement, a location can have different names because of the unit used in cataloguing, as well as because of temporal or regional and linguistic variaions. Hence, the spatial value of Coverage must be defined by a scheme. A scheme must stipulate temporal reference as unit of catalogue. For instance, the Sinica Corpus covers the language of the Republica of China in Taiwan. Its metadata will have the following value &lt;Coverage refine= &amp;quot;spatial&amp;quot; scheme= As mentioned above [Sinica Calendar] offers conversion table for the past 2000 years between Chinese and Western calendars. As for the units for cataloguing of spatial location, OLAC 0.4 Version adopts [TGN]( Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Terms). And many other digital archives follow Alexandria Digital Library Feature Type Thesaurus [ADL]. The ADL type thesaurus have been adopted by the digital archives project in Taiwan and translated into Chinese by Academia Sinica Metadata Architecture and Application Team [Sinica MAAT]. 4 Applying OLACMS to Language Archives in Taiwan Each text in Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese (Sinica Corpus) is marked up with five textual parameters: Mode, Genre, Style, Topic and Medium. These are important textual information that needs to be catalogued in metadata. The following shows how we transfer and represent these (legacy) textual information to OLACMS: 4.1.Mode and Genre</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.864092692307692">We add a refine attribute under Type. Mode is added in the controlled vocabulary as Primary type, and Genre is added as sub type. For instance, a recorded and transcribed speech is catalogued as &lt;Type code=&amp;quot;Sound&amp;quot; 4.2.Style There are four styles that are differentiated in Sinica Corpus: Narrative, Argumentative, Expository, and Descriptive. We add a new refine attirbute under Descriptio, with Style as a controlled vocabulary. For instance, a diary will be catalogued as: &lt;Description refine=&amp;quot;Style&amp;quot;&gt; Narration &lt;/Description&gt;. language reources as: Newspaper, General Magazine, Academic Journal, Textbook, Reference Book, Thesis, General Book, Audio/Visual Medium, Conversation/Interview. We may also add other audio-video media such as CD,V8...etc. As mentioned above, this can be easily described with DC: Format refine attribute of Medium. 4.4.Topic The Topic parameter of Sinica Corpus has the same content as the element Subject. This can simply be transferred through a table. Table 2 Topic of Sinica Corpus(Ckip Technology</abstract>

For inherited texts with no IP restrictions, this may be the critical information piece of information to identify who is the rightful owner/creator of the electronic version. • There are many Medium values old (procelain, rubbing, bamboo engraving, silk scroll, etc.) and new (DVD, MO, ZIP...etc). Hence the controlled vocabulary of attributes such as Medium and SourceCode often has quick and drastic changes. In order to maintain versatility and comprehensive coverage, this set of controlled vocabulary must be open and allows each participant to register, subject to the approval by OLAC. 5 Language Identification Constable and Simons (2000) noted that a computer, unlike human beings, cannot automatically identify the language of a text that it is reading yet. Hence metadata must play a central role in identifying the language that each resource uses. For instance, Malay and English uses the same 26 letters. And Archaic Chinese 2000 years ago and Modern Mandarin can be expressed by pretty much the same set of Chinese characters. These are all different languages and need to be identified before a language resource can be used. SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics, in its white-paper identified five major issues for language identification: Change, Inadequate definition, Scale, and Documentation. SIL has produced an online searchable database: Ethnologue that provides a comprehensive system of language identification covering more than 6,800 languages. This is adopted by OLAC as an obvious improvement over the very small set covered in DC. Bird et al. (2001), however, pointed out some problems of coverage if the Enthlogue system is adapted without further means of enrichment. The three broad categories of problem are: over-splitting, over-chunking and omission. Over-splitting occurs when a language variety is treated as a distinct language. For example, Nataoran is given its own language code (AIS) even though the scholars at Academia Sinica consider it to be a dialect of Amis (ALV). Over-chunking occurs when two distinct languages are treated as dialects of a single language (there does not appear to be an example of this in the Ethnologue&apos;s treatment of Formosan languages). Omission occurs when a language is not listed. For example, two extinct languages, Luilang and Quaquat, are not listed in the Ethnologue. Another kind of omission problem occurs when the language is actually listed, but the name by which the archivist knows it is not listed, whether as a primary name or an alternate name. In such a case the archivist cannot make the match to assign the proper code. For instance, the language listed as Taroko (TRV) in the Ethnologue is known as Seediq by Academia Sinica; several of the alternate names listed by the Ethnologue are similar, but none matches exactly. The above problems may prove to be a stumbling block for archives that attempt to integrate linguistic resources with GIS (Geographic Information System), such as the [Formosan Language Archive] at Academia Sinica. A GIS-based language atlas will most likely be very concerned with fine-grained changes and variations among languages and dialects within a geographic area. In other words, these kind of archives may either discover yet unrecorded language or sub-language differentiations or need even finer classification in Ethnologue or any language identification system. Hence the solution proposed in Bird et al. (2001) of allowing local language classification systems to register must be implemented under OLAC. 6 Conclusion We looked at a couple of OLAC derived metadatasets, as well as applied OLAC version 0.4. to three different language archives in Taiwan. We proposed some suggestions for enriching of OLACMS based on the study. There are two general directions to bear in mind. First, as the number and complexity of language resources becomes higher and higher, the need to have a uniform standard or to easy access to the owner of each resource becomes even greater. Therefore, we envision that the element of Creator, Contributor etc. needs further elaboration, which may include practical information such as email addresses etc. Second, as the language archives get richer, the need to note language variation grows even bigger. Simple language identification of allotting a resource a unique language code is not enough. There will be great need to infer linguistic relations from these codes. Since it is impossible to build a complete reportiore of resources for all languages, it is very often that a resources from the closest related language must be borrowed. The representation of linguistic relations will be the next challenge of language identification.</abstract>

However, since not all linguistic resources come to existence directly through sessions, hence not all linguistic resources can be described by IMDI.2 In principle, IMDI metadata can be mapped to OLAC metadata, just as OLAC metadata can be mapped to DC. IMDI Team (August 2001) mapped IMDI Session Descriptions with OLAC 0.3 Version. IMDI Team also use existing description formalisms used by institutions that deal with “published corpora” such as [ELRA] and [LDC]. The set of metadata elements that describe “published corpora” are called “catalogue” metadata elements. The IMDI Team (Gibbon, et al. 2001) launched IMDI Metadata Elements for Catalogue Descriptions, Version 2.1. It also includes Metadata Elements for Lexicon Descriptions. OLACMS has been updated since December 2001. Hence we did an updated comparison and present the result in this section. Note that since IMDI is an elaboration of OLACMS, we concentrate on the IMDI elements that are not specified in OLACMS and are likely to find wider application.
