Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99934147368421">
In this paper we present a corpus-based study
involving the linear order of subject, indirect
object and direct object in German. The aim
was to examine several hypotheses derived from
Hawkins&apos; (1994) performance theory. In this
context it was crucial to examine whether and
to which extend length influences the order of
subject and objects. The analysis was based on
data extracted from the annotated NEGRA cor-
pus (Skut et al., 1998) and the untagged Frank-
furter Rundschau corpus. We developed an
analysis system operating on the untagged cor-
pus that facilitates the acquisition of data and
subsequent statistical analysis. In the following,
we describe this system and discuss the results
drawn from the analysis of the data. These re-
sults do not support the theoretical assumptions
made by Hawkins. Furthermore, they suggest
the investigation of other factors than length.

1 Background and Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997068">
Based on the assumption that basic word or-
der regularities are reflected in the frequency
of their occurrence, a corpus-based study in-
volving word order phenomena in German was
carried out. A number of different parameters
have been linked with the linearization of com-
plements and adjuncts in languages exhibiting
a relatively free word order. The main fac-
tors that have been proposed are: Pronomi-
nality, case, information structure, definiteness,
thematic roles, stress and length. Theories
found in literature range from predominantly
competence-based models to explanations al-
most entirely based on performance assump-
tions.
Recently, Hawkins&apos; (1994) length-based the-
ory has received much attention in general lin-
guistics (typology), computational linguistics
(modelling language evolution) and psycholin-
guistics (memory-based models of sentence pro-
cessing). According to Hawkins, the influence
of all factors other than length can almost en-
tirely be explained as epiphenomena of length.
The data presented by Hawkins are suggestive
but much too restricted in size to permit any
empirically supported conclusions.
In this paper we will report on a corpus-
based study involving six German verbs
exhibiting different basic order patterns
namely, NOM&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;NOM, ACC&lt;DAT,
DAT&lt;ACC . In order to reduce the effects of
other factors, we restricted the investigation
to non-pronominal NPs in the middle field.
Two corpora were chosen for the analysis:
a syntactically annotated corpus of German
newspaper text, the NEGRA corpus, and the
untagged Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. For
each of the two verb groups (transitive and
ditransitive), pairs of NOM&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;NOM
and ACC&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;ACC were considered.
The aim was to search for any interdependence
of word order and length. Apart from this, we
investigated the impact of definiteness on word
order. The data acquisition and analysis were
to a large part automated.
Section 2 summarizes the main ideas of
Hawkins&apos; length-based theory. In section 3 we
present the statistical investigation and discuss
the results in section 4. Finally we conclude
with section 5.

The extraction of all sentences containing one of
the verbs under investigation was done by run-
ning pattern-matching routines. These routines
used regular expressions including all verbal in-
flections and carried out format conversions re-
quired by the subsequent component.

Morphological Analysis
As already mentioned we were looking for par-
ticular sequences of case-marked NPs. There-
fore each NP had to be labeled with case infor-
mation. In order to do this, the NP bound-
aries had to be determined. We employed
a stochastic parser (Skut&apos;s (1999) chunk tag-
ger) that recognizes the internal structure of
phrases and determines NP boundaries. As
output for complex NPs, the chunk tagger de-
livered information about phrase boundaries
and part-of-speech tags. For the annotation of
structural and part-of-speech information, the
chunk-tagger uses two instances of the TnT-
Tagger developed by Brants (1996). The next
step was followed by a morphological analysis
(MORPHIX (Finkler and Neumann, 1986)) la-
beling each word of each NP with information
about inflection based on the already available
part-of-speech information. The case determi-
nation of complex NPs was done by a unification
of the number, gender and case values of each
word belonging to the whole NP. The output
consisted of NPs labeled with partly ambiguous
case information as shown in examples (3)-(5).

In the following revision, all sentences contain-
ing at least one of the relevant NPs in the mid-
dle field were automatically extracted. The case
disambiguation, the determination of length
and definiteness of each NP, and the determi-
nation of the verbal position was done manu-
ally. An additional program interface recoded
the results of this revision in numeric variables
required by the statistical interpretation.

For the evaluation of the system we compared
its output with a manually evaluated sample
containing 100 sentences and determined pre-
cision and recall. Table 4 shows precision and

phological analysis.

The recall of 100% for MORPHIX has several
reasons. Firstly MORPHIX is operating only on
the correct output of the preceding chunk tag-
ger; secondly, in each case the unification fails
MORPHIX labels the NP with [NOM, DAT,
ACC, GEN]. This perfect recall is responsible
for the low precision of 53% because of the
frequently occurring fourfold case assignment.
However, this behaviour of MORPHIX exactly
met our requirements, since we were primarily
concerned with extensive data acquisition (the
automatic analysis was followed by a manual
evaluation anyway.)

The analysis of the data was done by using
cross tables, chi square tests and the analysis
of means. In spite of the corpus size, the data
do not permit chi square tests in some cases. In
these cases, we pursued a purely descriptive ap-
proach. For the sake of space, we will describe
the results of the cross tables only. We will first
have a look at the distribution of NP sequences
in the Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. In ad-
dition we will consider the factors length and
definiteness in isolation. We will then look at
the interaction of the factors holding definite-
ness constant.

of the two possible sequences (marked boldface)
for each verb. Gelingen and zur Verfagung ste-
hen clearly favour DAT&lt;NOM ordering while
helfen shows the opposite preference. A simi-
lar picture is found for the ditransitive verbs,
with one exception: vorstellen, both sequences
are represented nearly the same. Geben and
zur Verfiigung stellen show a clear preference
for DAT&lt;ACC ordering. Given this distribu-
tion, it seems more appropriate to determine
basic word order dependent on the particular
verb, rather than specifying a general basic or-
der of arguments (cf. (Haider, 1993)). Thus, we
consider orderings exhibiting high frequencies
as basic orders and orderings exhibiting low fre-
quencies as rearrangements, e.g. the basic order
of gelingen is DAT&lt;NOM, the rearrangement is
NOM&lt;DAT, helfen appears with NOM&lt;DAT
as basic order and DAT&lt;NOM as rearrange-
ment. For vorstellen, the issue which ordering
is the basic order and which ordering is the rear-
rangement cannot be determined from the em-
pirical distribution, since this verb is roughly
equi-based with respect to NP-order.
Against the background of Hawkins&apos; model
the question arises if both basic order and rear-
rangement can be motivated by length phenom-
ena.

4.2 How Good Are EIC&apos;s Predictions?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966454545454">
Tables 5 and 6 show the total percentages of the
EIC-unmarked and EIC-marked cases, the basic
order and the rearrangement of each verb. The
ETC-unmarked cases indicate those for which
EIC makes the right predictions (short NP pre-
cedes long NP), in the EIC-marked cases EIC
makes the wrong predictions (long NP precedes
short NP). The proportions of the marked and
unmarked cases do not add up to 100% because
the cases with two NPs of equal length have not
been considered.
In total we can observe that the EIC predic-
tions are fairly good for the unmarked cases but
still there is a considerable amount of cases de-
viating from EIC. Apart from this the EIC pre-
dictions for rearrangements are worse than for
the basic order. This becomes clear from the
pattern of zur Verfiigung stehen of Table 5 and
zur Verfagung stellen of Table 6. Comparing the
ETC-unmarked and the ETC-marked cases of the
basic orders with the EIC-unmarked and EIC-
marked cases of the rearrangements, the pro-
portions of the unmarked cases are lower and
the proportions of the marked cases are higher
in the rearrangements. The same holds for
vorstellen. We may not determine basic order
and rearrangement but the ETC predictions are
quite bad for one of the two orderings (shown
in the column headed by rearrangement).
Since the rearrangements of helfen, gelingen
and geben are underrepresented (gelingen: 3,
helfen: 13 and geben: 8), there is no evidence in
favour or against the described observation.

4.3 Definiteness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999293782608696">
Tables 9 and 10 show the distribution of the
sequences of definite and indefinite NPs in our
data set.
For the basic order of both verb groups it
can be observed that def-indef (definite NP pre-
cedes indefinite NP) and def-def sequences (def-
inite NP precedes definite NP ) occur most fre-
quently. For the rearrangements, it is striking
that most of the sequences belong to the def-def
pattern. This holds for the transitive as well as
for the ditransitive verbs. One exception can be
found: the indef-def sequences of zur Verfiigung
stellen. Since Hawkins claims that all factors
apart from length are epiphenomenal, the effect
of length should be even stronger if the other
factors (e.g. definiteness) are held constant. In
our analysis, this means that we should see a
clear effect of EIC for the rearranged groups be-
cause of the high amount of def-def sequences.
This, on the other hand, is at odds with the re-
sults we have already drawn from Tables 5 and
6. Recall that, EIC made worse predictions for
the rearrangements than for the basic order.

for verbs exhibiting a large proportion of rear-
ranged def-def sequences (zur Verfiigung stehen,
vorstellen, zur Verfiigung stellen). For the verbs
with few rearranged def-def orderings (gelingen,
helfen, geben), EIC makes fairly good predic-
tions. Comparing the definite, rearranged EIC-
marked cases with the total percentages of the
EIC marked cases (serving as baseline) the pro-
portions of the definite, rearranged EIC marked
cases are above baseline for the verbs exhibiting
high frequencies. Comparing the definite, rear-
ranged EIC-unmarked cases with the total per-
centages of the EIC-unmarked cases the propor-
tions of the definite, rearranged EIC-unmarked
cases are below baseline. Again, this supports
the assumption that EIC does not dominate
rearrangements. The results indicate that a
closer examination of information-based param-
eters such as Topic and Focus, which are corre-
lated with definiteness, will be required.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7847218">
The results presented in this paper suggest that:
• The determination of basic order and rear-
rangement depends on the particular verb.
The data do not support specification of a
general basic order.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9310546">
• EIC is not the primary factor determin-
ing the linearization of complements in the
middle field.
• Considering rearranged sequences the fac-
tor definiteness dominates EIC.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979523809524">
The made observations are at odds with
Hawkins&apos; (1994) claiming that length is the only
factor determining word order. For example
definiteness determines word order even in those
cases where EIC cannot motivate the ordering.
Moreover, several parameters seem to interact
and determine the sequence to a different ex-
tent, a claim that has already been proposed by
Uszkoreit (1987).
The present results emphasize the necessity of
further empirical research based on interpreted
and uninterpreted corpora. Especially an exam-
ination of the interaction between definiteness
and information-based factors requires further
extensive corpus-based studies.
The insights gained from these methodologies
show that linguists cannot rely exclusively on
introspective judgements as their sole source of
data. Furthermore, we hope to have demon-
strated the productivity of employing corpus
based studies in syntactic research.

<abstract confidence="0.995038582278481">In this paper we present a corpus-based study involving the linear order of subject, indirect object and direct object in German. The aim was to examine several hypotheses derived from Hawkins&apos; (1994) performance theory. In this context it was crucial to examine whether and to which extend length influences the order of subject and objects. The analysis was based on data extracted from the annotated NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998) and the untagged Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. We developed an analysis system operating on the untagged corpus that facilitates the acquisition of data and subsequent statistical analysis. In the following, we describe this system and discuss the results drawn from the analysis of the data. These results do not support the theoretical assumptions made by Hawkins. Furthermore, they suggest the investigation of other factors than length. 1 Background and Motivation Based on the assumption that basic word order regularities are reflected in the frequency of their occurrence, a corpus-based study involving word order phenomena in German was carried out. A number of different parameters have been linked with the linearization of complements and adjuncts in languages exhibiting a relatively free word order. The main factors that have been proposed are: Pronominality, case, information structure, definiteness, thematic roles, stress and length. Theories found in literature range from predominantly competence-based models to explanations almost entirely based on performance assumptions. Recently, Hawkins&apos; (1994) length-based theory has received much attention in general linguistics (typology), computational linguistics (modelling language evolution) and psycholinguistics (memory-based models of sentence processing). According to Hawkins, the influence of all factors other than length can almost entirely be explained as epiphenomena of length. The data presented by Hawkins are suggestive but much too restricted in size to permit any empirically supported conclusions. In this paper we will report on a corpusbased study involving six German verbs exhibiting different basic order patterns namely, NOM&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;NOM, ACC&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;ACC . In order to reduce the effects of other factors, we restricted the investigation to non-pronominal NPs in the middle field. Two corpora were chosen for the analysis: a syntactically annotated corpus of German newspaper text, the NEGRA corpus, and the untagged Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. For each of the two verb groups (transitive and ditransitive), pairs of NOM&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;NOM and ACC&lt;DAT, DAT&lt;ACC were considered. The aim was to search for any interdependence of word order and length. Apart from this, we investigated the impact of definiteness on word order. The data acquisition and analysis were to a large part automated. Section 2 summarizes the main ideas of Hawkins&apos; length-based theory. In section 3 we present the statistical investigation and discuss the results in section 4. Finally we conclude with section 5. 2 Hawkins&apos; Performance Theory The theory is based on the assumption that limitations on working memory influence the construction of constituents and that humans prefer to arrange constituents in orders that minimize processing effort.

These routines used regular expressions including all verbal inflections and carried out format conversions required by the subsequent component. 3.2.2 Shallow Parsing and Morphological Analysis As already mentioned we were looking for particular sequences of case-marked NPs. Therefore each NP had to be labeled with case information. In order to do this, the NP boundaries had to be determined. We employed a stochastic parser (Skut&apos;s (1999) chunk tagger) that recognizes the internal structure of phrases and determines NP boundaries. As output for complex NPs, the chunk tagger delivered information about phrase boundaries and part-of-speech tags. For the annotation of structural and part-of-speech information, the chunk-tagger uses two instances of the TnT- Tagger developed by Brants (1996). The next step was followed by a morphological analysis (MORPHIX (Finkler and Neumann, 1986)) labeling each word of each NP with information about inflection based on the already available part-of-speech information. The case determination of complex NPs was done by a unification of the number, gender and case values of each word belonging to the whole NP. The output consisted of NPs labeled with partly ambiguous case information as shown in examples (3)-(5).

The case disambiguation, the determination of length and definiteness of each NP, and the determination of the verbal position was done manually. An additional program interface recoded the results of this revision in numeric variables required by the statistical interpretation. 3.2.4 Evaluation For the evaluation of the system we compared its output with a manually evaluated sample containing 100 sentences and determined precision and recall. Table 4 shows precision and recall for the chunking application and the morphological analysis. Precision Recall Chunk tagger MORPHIX Table 4: Recall and precision for used NLP tools The recall of 100% for MORPHIX has several reasons. Firstly MORPHIX is operating only on the correct output of the preceding chunk tagger; secondly, in each case the unification fails MORPHIX labels the NP with [NOM, DAT, ACC, GEN]. This perfect recall is responsible for the low precision of 53% because of the frequently occurring fourfold case assignment. However, this behaviour of MORPHIX exactly met our requirements, since we were primarily concerned with extensive data acquisition (the automatic analysis was followed by a manual evaluation anyway.) The analysis of the data was done by using cross tables, chi square tests and the analysis of means. In spite of the corpus size, the data do not permit chi square tests in some cases. In these cases, we pursued a purely descriptive approach. For the sake of space, we will describe the results of the cross tables only. We will first have a look at the distribution of NP sequences in the Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. In addition we will consider the factors length and definiteness in isolation. We will then look at the interaction of the factors holding definiteness constant. 4.1 Distribution in the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus Table 7 shows the distribution of the examined sequences for each transitive verb, Table 8 shows the frequencies of the object sequences for ditransitive verbs. By looking at the distribution of the NP orderings there are concentrations on either one 92% 53% 84% 38 Verb Basic Order EIC-unmarked marked Rearrangement EIC-unmarked marked Total EIC-un- Total EIC-marked marked gelingen 257 58% 21% 3 100% 0% 58% 20% helfen 148 45% 30% 13 39% 23% 44% 29% zur Verfilgung 119 63% 18% 37 41% 24% 54% 24% stehen Table 5: Transitive verbs and EIC Verb Basis Order EIC-unmarked marked Rearrangement EIC-unmarked marked Total EIC-un- Total EIC-marked marked geben 457 40% 37% 8 38% 38% 40% 37% vorstellen 29 69% 14% 24 8% 59% 42% 34% zur Verfilgung 182 47% 29% 78 27% 42% 41% 33% stellen Table 6: Ditransitive verbs and EIC Verb verb frequency DAT&lt;NOM NOM&lt;DAT gelingen 3980 257 3 helfen 5700 13 148 zur Verffigung 1974 119 37 stehen Table 7: Transitive verbs Verb verb frequency DAT&lt;ACC ACC&lt;DAT geben 11354 457 8 vorstellen 3694 29 24 zur Verffigung stellen 2094 182 78 Table 8: Ditransitive verbs of the two possible sequences (marked boldface) each verb. Verfagung stefavour DAT&lt;NOM ordering while the opposite preference. A similar picture is found for the ditransitive verbs, one exception: sequences represented nearly the same. Verfiigung stellen a clear preference for DAT&lt;ACC ordering. Given this distribution, it seems more appropriate to determine basic word order dependent on the particular rather than specifying a order of arguments (cf. (Haider, 1993)). Thus, we consider orderings exhibiting high frequencies as basic orders and orderings exhibiting low frequencies as rearrangements, e.g. the basic order DAT&lt;NOM, the rearrangement is with NOM&lt;DAT as basic order and DAT&lt;NOM as rearrange- For issue which ordering is the basic order and which ordering is the rearrangement cannot be determined from the empirical distribution, since this verb is roughly equi-based with respect to NP-order. Against the background of Hawkins&apos; model the question arises if both basic order and rearrangement can be motivated by length phenomena. 4.2 How Good Are EIC&apos;s Predictions? Tables 5 and 6 show the total percentages of the EIC-unmarked and EIC-marked cases, the basic order and the rearrangement of each verb. The ETC-unmarked cases indicate those for which EIC makes the right predictions (short NP precedes long NP), in the EIC-marked cases EIC makes the wrong predictions (long NP precedes short NP). The proportions of the marked and unmarked cases do not add up to 100% because the cases with two NPs of equal length have not been considered. In total we can observe that the EIC predictions are fairly good for the unmarked cases but still there is a considerable amount of cases deviating from EIC. Apart from this the EIC predictions for rearrangements are worse than for the basic order. This becomes clear from the of Verfiigung stehen Table 5 and Verfagung stellen Table 6. Comparing the ETC-unmarked and the ETC-marked cases of the basic orders with the EIC-unmarked and EICmarked cases of the rearrangements, the proportions of the unmarked cases are lower and the proportions of the marked cases are higher in the rearrangements. The same holds for may not determine basic order and rearrangement but the ETC predictions are quite bad for one of the two orderings (shown in the column headed by rearrangement). the rearrangements of gelingen underrepresented and there is no evidence in favour or against the described observation. 39 Verb Basic Order def-indef indef-def def-def indef-ndef Rearrangement indef-def def-def indef-ndef def-indef gelingen 36% 2% 62% - 100% helfen 16% 19% 62% 3% 39% - 55% 8% zur Verfilgung 72% - 16% 12% 16% 5% 79% stehen Table 9: Transrtive verbs and definiteness Verb Basic Order def-indef indef-def def-def indef-indef Rearrangement indef-def def-def indef-indef def-indef geben 56% 7% 26% 11% 38% 12% 50% vorstellen 17% 3% 73% 7% 8% - 92% zur Verfilgung 66% 1% 18% 15% 7% 19% 69% 5% stellen Table 10: Ditransitive verbs and definiteness To conclude, length phenomena do not seem to be the only reason for deviation from the basic order. The results suggest to concentrate on additional factors. 4.3 Definiteness Tables 9 and 10 show the distribution of the sequences of definite and indefinite NPs in our data set. For the basic order of both verb groups it can be observed that def-indef (definite NP precedes indefinite NP) and def-def sequences (definite NP precedes definite NP ) occur most frequently. For the rearrangements, it is striking that most of the sequences belong to the def-def pattern. This holds for the transitive as well as for the ditransitive verbs. One exception can be the indef-def sequences of Verfiigung Hawkins claims that all factors apart from length are epiphenomenal, the effect of length should be even stronger if the other factors (e.g. definiteness) are held constant. In our analysis, this means that we should see a clear effect of EIC for the rearranged groups because of the high amount of def-def sequences. This, on the other hand, is at odds with the results we have already drawn from Tables 5 and 6. Recall that, EIC made worse predictions for the rearrangements than for the basic order. 4.4 EIC Revisited To test the expectations mentioned above we evaluated the EIC predictions for rearranged def-def sequences. The results are listed in Tables 11 and 12. The contribution of EIC does not meet the expectation derived from the &amp;quot;epiphenomenon hypothesis&amp;quot;. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that EIC makes incorrect predictions Verb Rearrangement defdef EIC unmarked EIC marked Total EIC unmarked Total EIC marked gelingen helfen zur Verfilgung stehen NOM&lt;DAT 3 100% - 58% 20% 7 57% 14% 44% 29% 29 21% 43% 54% 24% Table 11: Transitive verbs: EIC and definiteness Verb Rearrangedef- EIC un- EIC Total Total ment def marked marked EIC unmarked EIC marked geben ACC&lt;DAT 4 50% 25% 40% 37% vorstellen ACC&lt;DAT 22 9% 55% 42% 34% DAT&lt;ACC 21 71% 10% 42% 34% zur Verfilgung stellen ACC&lt;DAT 54 30% 41% 41% 33% Table 12: Ditransitive verbs: EIC and definiteness for verbs exhibiting a large proportion of reardef-def sequences Verfiigung stehen, zur Verfiigung stellen). the verbs few rearranged def-def orderings geben), makes fairly good predictions. Comparing the definite, rearranged EICmarked cases with the total percentages of the EIC marked cases (serving as baseline) the proportions of the definite, rearranged EIC marked cases are above baseline for the verbs exhibiting high frequencies. Comparing the definite, rearranged EIC-unmarked cases with the total percentages of the EIC-unmarked cases the proportions of the definite, rearranged EIC-unmarked cases are below baseline. Again, this supports the assumption that EIC does not dominate rearrangements. The results indicate that a closer examination of information-based paramsuch as are correlated with definiteness, will be required. 40 5 Conclusions The results presented in this paper suggest that: • The determination of basic order and rearrangement depends on the particular verb. The data do not support specification of a order. • EIC is not the primary factor determining the linearization of complements in the middle field. • Considering rearranged sequences the factor definiteness dominates EIC. The made observations are at odds with Hawkins&apos; (1994) claiming that length is the only factor determining word order. For example definiteness determines word order even in those cases where EIC cannot motivate the ordering. Moreover, several parameters seem to interact and determine the sequence to a different extent, a claim that has already been proposed by Uszkoreit (1987). The present results emphasize the necessity of further empirical research based on interpreted and uninterpreted corpora. Especially an examination of the interaction between definiteness and information-based factors requires further extensive corpus-based studies. The insights gained from these methodologies show that linguists cannot rely exclusively on introspective judgements as their sole source of data. Furthermore, we hope to have demonstrated the productivity of employing corpus based studies in syntactic research.</abstract>

The aim was to examine several hypotheses derived from Hawkins&apos; (1994) performance theory. In this context it was crucial to examine whether and to which extend length influences the order of subject and objects. The analysis was based on data extracted from the annotated NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998) and the untagged Frankfurter Rundschau corpus. We developed an analysis system operating on the untagged corpus that facilitates the acquisition of data and subsequent statistical analysis. In the following, we describe this system and discuss the results drawn from the analysis of the data. These results do not support the theoretical assumptions made by Hawkins. Furthermore, they suggest the investigation of other factors than length. 1 Background and Motivation Based on the assumption that basic word order regularities are reflected in the frequency of their occurrence, a corpus-based stud</context>
