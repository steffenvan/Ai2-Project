This paper describes preliminary work
concerning the creation of a Framework to aid
in lexical semantic resource construction. The
Framework consists of 9 stages during which
various lexical resources are collected,
studied, and combined into a single
combinatory lexical resource. To evaluate the
general Framework it was applied to a small
set of English and Arabic resources,
automatically combining them into a single
lexical knowledge base that can be used for
query translation and disambiguation in Cross-
Language Information Retrieval.

1 Introduction

Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR)
systems facilitate matching between queries and
documents that do not necessarily share the same
language. To accomplish this matching between
distinct vocabularies, a translation step is required.
The preferred method is to translate the query
language into the document language by using
machine translation, or lexicon lookup. While
machine translation may work reasonably well on
full sentences, queries tend to be short lists of
keywords, and are often more suited for lexical
lookup (Oard and Diekema, 1998).
This paper describes a preliminary framework
for the creation of a lexical resource through the
combination of other lexical resources. The
preliminary Framework will be applied to create a
translation lexicon for use in an English-Arabic
CLIR system. The resulting lexicon will be used to
translate English queries into (unvocalized) Arabic.
It will also provide the user of the system with
lexical semantic information about each of the
possible translations to aid with disambiguation of
the Arabic query. While the combination of lexical
resources is nothing new, establishing a sound
methodology for resource combination, as
presented in this paper on English-Arabic semantic
resource construction, is an important contribution.
Once the Framework has been evaluated for
English-Arabic resource construction, it can be
extended to additional languages and resource
types.

As pointed out previously, translation plays an
important role in CLIR. Most of the CLIR systems
participating in the (Arabic) Cross-Language
Information Retrieval track1 at the Text REtrieval
Conference (TREC)2 used a query translation
dictionary-based approach where each source
query term was looked up in the translation
resource and replaced by all or a subset of the
available translations to create the target query
(Larkey, Ballesteros, and Connell, 2002), (Gey and
Oard, 2001), (Oard and Gey, 2002). The four main
sources of translation knowledge that have been
applied to CLIR are ontologies, bilingual
dictionaries, machine translation lexicons, and
corpora.
Research shows that combining translation
resources increases CLIR performance (Larkey et
al., 2002) Not only does this combination increase
translation coverage, it also refines translation
probability calculations. Chen and Gey used a
combination of dictionaries for query translation
and compared retrieval performance of this
dictionary combination with machine translation
(Chen and Gey, 2001). The dictionaries
outperformed MT. Small bilingual dictionaries
were created by Larkey and Connell (2001) for
place names and also inverted an Arabic-English
dictionary to English-Arabic. They found that
using dictionaries that have multiple senses,

though not always correct, outperform bilingual
term lists with only one translation alternative.
Combining dictionaries is especially important
when working with ambiguous languages such as
Arabic.
Many TREC teams used translation probabilities
to deal with translation ambiguity and term
weighting issues, especially since a translation
lexicon with probabilities was provided as a
standard resource. However, most teams combined
translation probabilities from different sources and
achieved better retrieval results that way (Xu,
Fraser, and Weischedel, 2002), (Chowdhury et al.,
2002), (Darwish and Oard, 2002). Darwish and
Oard (2002) posit that since there is no such thing
as a complete translation resource one should
always use a combination of resources and that
translation probabilities will be more accurate if
one uses more resources.

Ruiz (2000) uses the term lexical triangulation
to describe the process of mapping a bilingual
English-Chinese lexicon into an existing WordNet-
based Conceptual Interlingua by using translation
evidence from multiple sources. Recall that
WordNet synsets are formed by groups of terms
with similar meaning (Miller, 1990). By translating
each of the synonyms into Chinese, Ruiz created a
frequency-ranked list of translations, and assumed
that the most frequent translations were most likely
to be correct. By establishing certain translation
evidence thresholds, mappings of varying
reliability were created. This method was later
augmented with additional translation evidence
from a Chinese-English parallel corpus.
A methodology to improve query translation is
described by Chen (2003). The methodology is
intended to improve translation through the use of
NLP techniques and the combining of the
document collection, available translation
resources, and transliteration techniques. A basic
mapping was created between the Chinese terms
from the collection and the English terms in
WordNet by using a simple Chinese-English
lexicon. Missing terms such as Named Entities
were added through the process of transliteration.
By customizing the translation resources to the
document collection Chen showed an improvement
in retrieval performance.

3 Establishing a Preliminary Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999398529411765">
The preliminary Framework provides a
methodology for the automatic combination of
various lexical semantic resources such as machine
readable dictionaries, ontologies, encyclopedias,
and machine translation lexicons. While these
individual resources are all valuable individually,
automatic intelligent lexical combination into one
single lexical knowledge base will provide an
enhancement that is larger than the sum of its parts.
The resulting resource will provide better
coverage, more reliable translation probability
information, and additional information leveraged
through the process of lexical triangulation. In an
initial evaluation of the preliminary Framework, it
was applied to the combination of English and
Arabic lexical resources as described in section 4.
The preliminary Framework consists of 9 stages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993841181818182">
1) establish goals
2) collect resources
3) create resource feature matrix
4) develop evidence combination strategies
and thresholds
5) construct combinatory lexical resource
6) manage problems that arise during creation
7) evaluate combinatory lexical resource
8) implement possible improvements
9) create final version of combinatory lexical
resource.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997833357142857">
Stage 1: The first stage of the Framework is
intended to establish the possible usage of the
combinatory lexical resource (resulting form the
combination of multiple resources). The
requirements of this resource will drive the second
stage: resource collection.
Stage 2: Two types of resources should be
collected: language processing resources such as
stemmers and tokenizers; and lexical semantic
resources such as dictionaries and lexicons. While
not every resource may seem particularly useful at
first, different resources can aid in mapping other
resources together. During the second stage,
conversion into a single encoding (such as UTF-8)
will also take place.
Stage 3: Once a set of resources has been
collected, the resource feature matrix can be
created. This matrix provides an overview of the
types of information found in the collected
resources and of certain resource characteristics.
For example, it is important to note what base form
the dictionary entries have. Some dictionaries use
the singular form (for nouns) or indefinite form
(for verbs), some use roots, others use stems, and
free resources from the web often use a
combination of all of the above. By studying the
feature matrix the evidence combination strategies
for stage four can be developed.

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998939454545455">
Stage 4: An intelligent resource combination
strategy should be informed by the features of the
different resources. It may be, for example, that
one resource uses vocalized Arabic only and that
another resource uses both vocalized and
unvocalized Arabic. This fact should be taken into
account by the combination strategy since the
second resource can serve as an intermediary to
map the first resource. Thresholding decisions are
also part of stage four because the certainty of
some combinations will be higher than others.
Stage 5: Stage five involves writing programs
based on the findings in stage four that will
automatically create the combinatory lexical
resource. The combination programs should
provide output concerning problematic instances
that occur during the creation i.e. words that only
occur in a single resource, so that these problems
may be handled by alternative strategies in stage
six.
Stage 6: Most of the problems in stage six are
likely to be uncommon words, such as named
entities or transliteration. A transliteration step,
where for example English letters, i.e. r, are
mapped to the closest Arabic sounding letters, i.e.
, may be applied for languages that do not share
the same orthographies.
Stage 7: After the initial combinatory lexical
resource has been created it needs to be evaluated.
First the accuracy (quality) of the combination
mappings of the various resources needs to be
assessed in an intrinsic evaluation. After it has
been established that the combination has been
successful, an extrinsic evaluation can be carried
out. In this evaluation the combinatory lexical
resource is tested as part of the actual application
the source was intended for, i.e. CLIR. (For a more
detailed description of evaluation see Section 5
below.)
Stage 8: These two evaluations will inform stage
eight where possible improvements are added to
the combination process.
Stage 9: The final version of the combinatory
lexical resource can be created in stage nine.

4 Application of the Framework to English-
Arabic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993305">
The preliminary Framework as described in
section 3 was applied to five English and Arabic
language resources as a kind of feasibility test.
Following the Framework, we first established the
goals of the combinatory lexical resource. It was
determined that the resource would be used as a
translation resource for CLIR that would aid query
translation as well as manual translation
disambiguation by the user. This meant that the
combinatory lexical resource would need
translation probabilities as well as English
definitions for Arabic translations to enable an
English language user to select the correct Arabic
translation. We collected five different resources:
WordNet 2.03, the lexicon included with the
Buckwalter Stemmer4, translations mined from
Ajeeb5, the wordlist from the Arabeyes project6,
and the LDC Arabic Gigaword corpus7. After the
resources were collected the feature matrix was
developed (see Table 1).

<bodyText confidence="0.999408576923077">
The established combinatory lexical resource
goals and resource feature matrix were used to
determine the combination strategy. Since the
resource should provide the user with definitions
of Arabic words and WordNet is most
comprehensive in this regard, it was selected as our
base resource. The AFP newswire collection from
the Gigaword corpus was used to mine Ajeeb. As
is evident in the matrix, all resources contain
English terms as a common denominator. The
information used for evidence combination was as
follows. Evidence used for mapping the Ajeeb and
Buckwalter lexicons is part-of-speech information.
Additionally, these two resources also provide
vocalized Arabic terms/stems that can be used for a
more reliable (less ambiguous) match. The
Arabeyes lexicon is not terribly rich but was used
as additional evidence for a certain translation
through frequency weighting. The combinatory
lexical resource was constructed by mapping the
three lexical resources into WordNet using the
evidence as discussed above (see Table 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.999478">
After examining the combinatory lexical
resource we found that the Arabeyes Arabic terms
could not be compared directly to the Arabic terms
in the other lexical resources since the determiner
prefixes are still attached to the terms (as in f-Wl
for example). More problematic were the
translations mined from Ajeeb since the part-of-
speech information of the Arabic term did not
necessarily match the part-of-speech of the
translations:

<bodyText confidence="0.9999625">
The first problem is easily fixed by applying a
light stemmer to the dictionary. At this point it is
not clear however, how to fix the second problem.
It was also decided that the translation reliability
weighting by frequency is too limited to be useful.
A back-translation lookup needs to determine how
many other terms can result in a certain translation.
This data can then update the reliability score.

5 Comprehensive Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999264">
While we only have carried out a preliminary
evaluation, we envision a comprehensive
evaluation in the near future. As part of this
evaluation three different types of evaluation can
be carried out:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.971517571428572">
1) evaluate the process of applying the
Framework;
2) evaluate the combinatory lexical resource
itself; and
3) evaluate the contribution of the
combinatory lexical resource to the
application the resource was created for.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961032258064">
Evaluation of the process of applying the
Framework will provide evidence as to the
advantages and disadvantages of our Framework,
and where it may have to be adjusted.
The construction of a Combinatory Lexical
Resource by applying the Framework is the first
step toward an effective evaluation of the full
Framework. The construction process detailed in
Section 3 should be carefully documented. The
evaluation will focus on the time and effort spent
on the process, difficulties or ease with resources
that are acquired, managed and processed, as well
as problems or issues that arise during the process.
The intrinsic evaluation of the combinatory
lexical resource indicates the quality of the newly
created combinatory lexical resource. For this
evaluation a large random number of entries will
need to be evaluated for correctness. The
evaluation will provide accuracy and coverage
measures for the resource. Also, descriptive
statistics will be generated to provide general
understanding of the lexical resource that has been
produced.
The extrinsic evaluation of the combinatory
lexical resource is intended to measure the
contribution of the resource to an application (i.e.
CLIR, Information Extraction). The application of
choice should be run with the combinatory lexical
resource, and without. Performance metrics
appropriate for the type of application can be
collected for both experiments and then compared.

6 Conclusion and future research
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997170611111111">
A general Framework for lexical resource
construction was presented in the context of
English-Arabic semantic resource combination.
The initial evaluation of the Framework looks
promising in that it was successfully applied to
combine five English-Arabic resources. The stages
of the Framework provided a useful guideline for
lexical resource combination and can be applied to
resources in any language. We plan to extend the
evaluation of the Framework to a more in depth
intrinsic evaluation where the quality of the
mappings is tested. An extrinsic evaluation should
also take place to evaluate the combinatory lexical
resource as part of the CLIR system. As for future
research we hope to extend the evidence
combination algorithms to include more
sophisticated information using back translation
and transliteration.

Most of the CLIR systems participating in the (Arabic) Cross-Language Information Retrieval track1 at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)2 used a query translation dictionary-based approach where each source query term was looked up in the translation resource and replaced by all or a subset of the available translations to create the target query (Larkey, Ballesteros, and Connell, 2002), (Gey and Oard, 2001), (Oard and Gey, 2002).

Recall that WordNet synsets are formed by groups of terms with similar meaning (Miller, 1990). By translating each of the synonyms into Chinese, Ruiz created a frequency-ranked list of translations, and assumed that the most frequent translations were most likely to be correct. By establishing certain translation evidence thresholds, mappings of varying reliability were created. This method was later augmented with additional translation evidence from a Chinese-English parallel corpus. A methodology to improve query translation is described by Chen (2003). The methodology is intended to improve translation through the use of NLP techniques and the combining of the document collection,</context>

To accomplish this matching between distinct vocabularies, a translation step is required. The preferred method is to translate the query language into the document language by using machine translation, or lexicon lookup. While machine translation may work reasonably well on full sentences, queries tend to be short lists of keywords, and are often more suited for lexical lookup (Oard and Diekema, 1998). This paper describes a preliminary framework for the creation of a lexical resource through the combination of other lexical resources. The preliminary Framework will be applied to create a translation lexicon for use in an English-Arabic CLIR system. The resulting lexicon will be used to translate English queries into (unvocalized) Arabic. It will also provide the user of the system with lexical semantic information about each of the possible translations to aid with disambiguation of the Arabic query. While the combination of lexical resources is nothing new, establishing a sound methodolo</context>
