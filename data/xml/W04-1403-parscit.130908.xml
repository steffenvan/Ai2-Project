<bodyText confidence="0.999748733333333">
Localisation is one of the fastest growing
industrial sectors in the digital world. Since
the mid-eighties, the role of localisation has
developed and changed dramatically.
Localisation has been redefined as the
provision of services and technologies for the
management of multilinguality across the
global information flow. This paper discusses
the need for easily accessible dedicated
language resources for localisation, provides a
practical example of what can be achieved
with appropriate language resources in the
context of localisation and proposes a strategy
to acquire, maintain and make them easily
accessible.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991029289473684">
Since its emergence in the mid 1980s,
localisation has largely been defined as the
linguistic and cultural adaptation of products for
specific locales. Over the past 20 years,
Localisation has become one of the engines driving
the development of the multilingual information
society and probably the first industrial sector
where language resources have been used widely
and consistently on large-scale commercial
projects.
Localisation professionals must prepare very
large amounts of digital content simultaneously for
different markets in acceptable quality and at
affordable costs. This is only possible with the
support of language resources, such as written and
spoken corpora, translation memories and
terminology databases, as well as the appropriate
software tools for the acquisition, preparation,
collection, management, customisation and use of
these resources.
In the following paragraphs, we will provide an
overview of the current state of the localisation
industry and its requirements, and focus on those
aspects of the localisation process where the
successful use of language resources is crucial for
the timely delivery of multilingual digital content.
We will describe some of the most widely used
language resources in localisation. Finally, we will
describe major current research efforts relating to
language resources and localisation, and highlight
the opportunity for the establishment of a
Language Resources Centre for Localisation.
2 The changing face of localisation
In this section, we will provide some
background information which will help to explain
the reasons for the changing needs of the
localisation industry, particularly in relation to
language resources.

2.1 Growing language populations create
commercial opportunities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995434181818182">
Any content made available on the digital
networks (e.g. the internet) becomes instantly
available to millions of people across the globe. To
make this content accessible, however, it needs to
be localised. In today’s cyberspace, posting digital
content in just one language is not sufficient
anymore.
Of a total online language population of 680
million in September 2003, only 35.5% spoke
English as a mother tongue, but 25% spoke
Chinese, Japanese or Korean (CJK) and another

25% Spanish, German, French, Italian and
Portuguese.
In this scenario, localisation is a pre-requisite for
the provision of equal access to the digital
information society independently of an
individual’s cultural and linguistic background or
their geographical location and, at the same time,
offers enormous business potential. In addition, it
is evident that localised digital content
(applications and systems) is a pre-requisite for the
preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity in
the digital world.
According to US-analysts Allied Business
Intelligence, the world-wide market for translation
and software or web localisation is growing from
US$11 billion (1999) to US$20 billion this year.
However, although much digital content is
created in Asia and Europe, 95% of localised
digital content still originates in the USA.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988283">
2.2 Localisation services – redefined
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999185322580645">
While politicians all over the world want to
make Information Society Technologies (IST)
available and accessible in the language and locale
of the people they represent, software and digital
content publishers need to respond to the demands
of their customers by supporting a wide variety of
local languages and cultures in their products.
Since its emergence in the mid-1980s, the
localisation industry has taken on the task of
responding to these requirements of business and
politics. Initially seen as just one of many service
suppliers to the general IT sector, it is now taking
on a more independent role translating the global
digital content challenge into new business and
social opportunities. It is the localisation industry
that can enable the open, pluralist, user-friendly
and inclusive multilingual and cross-cultural
information society.
The dramatic change in the role and the funtion
of localisation has happened in parallel with the
development and changes of the IT and content
publishing sectors in general, now all converging
in the digital world.
The businesses of computing (hardware,
software and services), communications
(telephony, cable and satellite), and content
(publishing, entertainment, advertising) are coming
together to create the new digital media industry.
New media publishing on the Internet combines
computing, entertainment, broadcasting, music and
video production.
The issues faced by a wide variety of formerly
independent, unconnected traditional content
publishing industries joining in the digital world
include the need to handle, control and translate
larger amounts of text than ever before into an ever
increasing variety of languages in parallel with the
development of the original version, within a tight
budget and according to strict quality guidelines as
well as the need to adapt — not just translate —
their products to the culture and locale of the target
market.
IT provides the framework for the convergence
of these activities. The localisation industry
provides the framework for the convergence of the
multilingual aspects of these activities.
Localisation becomes the catalyst for electronic
multilingual production and publishing.
On the background of these developments, the
concept of localisation is being redefined as the
provision of services and technologies for the
management of multilinguality across the global
information flow.
Timely and cost effective delivery of high
quality digital content to the global marketplace
has become the major growth area for the
localisation industry. It opened the relatively
narrow software localisation industry to a wider
range of players who are broadening traditional
roles within the software localisation industry.
Yet, the localisation industry does not have
access to a robust infrastructure comprising

language data and tools, which are a prerequisite
for the timely and cost effective creation and
deployment of multilingual, cross-cultural and
multimodal digital content. There is an urgent need
for the development of the structural basis to make
a sustained internationalisation and localisation
effort possible, especially for less widely spoken
languages.

2.3 Localisation research
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99589735">
The new role of the localisation industry also
creates new opportunities and requirements for
research and development.
How can the business requirement for a
reduction in production cost, combined with fast
throughput time and high quality be satisfied in the
context of localisation?
One answer to this question is by access to
adequate language resources, tools and standards.
Re-use of already translated material, translation
recycling, can not only speed-up translation, it can
also at least help to ensure a more consistent use of
terminology and thus increase the quality of the
translation.
Access to adequate terminology tools and
resources can also help to achieve better
translations at a lower cost.
To make appropriate use of these technologies
and resources, their role must be assessed in the
context of localisation.

3 Language resources and localisation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949193548387">
Language data or resources have been defined as
a set of speech or language data and descriptions in
machine readable form, used e.g. for building,
improving or evaluating natural language and
speech algorithms or systems, or, as core resources
for the software localisation and language services
industries, for language studies, electronic
publishing, international transactions, subject-area
specialists and end users.
Examples of language resources are written and
spoken corpora, computational lexicons,
terminology databases, speech collection and
processing, etc. Basic software tools are also
important for the acquisition, preparation,
collection, management, customisation and use of
these language resources and other resources. (see:
http://www.elra.info/article.php3?id article=35,
consulted May 2004)
Currently, there are no large collections of
language data relevant to localisation easily
accessible. While individual digital content
developers, especially large multinationals, have
very large collections of multilingual language data
available and use them in a highly effective and
efficient way, these data collections are not
available to the localisation community in general.
Large multinational content publishers, however,
have shown how the efficient use of language
resources can help to achieve astonishing
production results leading to what some have
described as the translation factory.

3.1.2 Support for SMEs and researchers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999506642857143">
There are no good reasons why the work of other
organisations, such as small and medium sized
enterprises (SME’s) and research organisations,
should not benefit from the intelligent use of
linguistic resources, including language data, tools
and standards. While large organisation catering
for the main language markets have access to the
finances necessary for the development and
maintenance of this linguistic infrastructure,
smaller organisations and those catering for
financially less significant markets will need the
support of a shared and widely supported
infrastructure.
This infrastructure would need to cover:

<bodyText confidence="0.999064555555556">
Linguistic tools are seen by the Localisation
Industry Standards Assocication (LISA) generally
as still an emerging sector (Localization Industry
Primer) although, according to LISA, enormous
progress has been made over the past years in the
area and a number of productivity enhancing tools
are now in use, without which the localisation
industry as we know it today would not be able to
operate.

3.2.1 Current situation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988280333333333">
The issues, which are addressed by linguistic
tools and technologies answer some of the central
questions asked by localisation professionals
around terminology handling and update
processing.
Terminology handling
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9348227">
■ Where can translators find standard
terminology in multiple languages?
■ How can multilingual terminology be
processed so that it can be made readily
available and easily accessible?
■ Are there feasible models and mechanisms
to maintain and constantly update
multilingual terminologys so that
modifications can be made accessible to
translators instantaneously?
■ How can changes in previously agreed
terminology be automatically integrated in
already translated text?
■ How can translated texts automatically be
checked for the correct and consistent use
of terminology?
Update processing
■ How can versions of the same source
material be compared against each other
automatically?
■ How can overlaps be identified, marked
and analysed?
■ How can source and target language
content be compared and aligned?
■ How can already translated text fragments
(exact or fuzzy matches) automatically be
used for the generation of a new target
version?
■ How can the limitations of Translation
Memory Systems be overcome?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983699666666667">
The linguistic tools and technologies most
widely needed and developed for use in the
internationalisation and localisation effort include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985098833333333">
■ Terminology management systems, which
aid the collection and use of specialised
vocabularies;
■ Translation memories, which are designed
to facilitate the reuse of previous
translations;
■ Machine translation, which provides actual
linguistic analysis and conversion of texts
from source language into the desired
target language;
■ User interface and user assistance visual
translation environments, which aid
translators to interactively work with
compiled and uncompiled resource files in
a variety of formats;
■ Language data analysis tools, which
rapidly compare and analyse old and new
source material;
■ Sophisticated matching tools leveraging
material from previous projects;
■ Natural language parsers;
■ Extract-and-Insert tools;
■ Parsers for natural language digital content
in compiled sources.

<bodyText confidence="0.998163666666667">
While large and sophisticated localisation
operations have easy access to relevant linguistic
third party technologies and in-house tools, smaller
operations often do not. Reviewing the large
variety of sophisticated tools and technologies
available on the market, they often shy away from
the purchase and implementation of tools because
of the perceived high-risk factor attached to their
deployment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.628944">
3.2.2 Impact
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994768">
A support infrastructure must be put into place to
allow smaller players involved in localisation
direct and online access to the widest variety of
tools and technologies and detailed information
about these. A first step in the implementation of
this infrastructure has been the establishment of the
Localisation Tools and Technology Laboratory and
Showcased (LOTS) as part of the European-funded
ELECT project.
Cooperating with leading industry associations,
such as the Globalisation and Localisation
Association (GALA) and The Institute of
Localisation Professionals (TILP), and building on
the expertise available within the ELECT
consortium, a sophisticated online library with
detailed background information on each of the
tools available was prepared and published.
The detailed LOTS-sponsored reviews of
individual tools and technologies will allow
potential users of linguistic tools and technologies,
specifically those working in small and medium
sized enterprises, to base their decision on which
tool to use for their particular localisation needs on
independent, well-researched and easily accessible
information.

Standards played a central role in the
establishment of the localisation industry’s first
association, the Localisation Industry Standards
Association (LISA). Very early on, localisation
professionals recognised that the successful
implementation of widely recognised standards
would lower the cost of localisation, shorten the
time necessary for the successful completion of
projects and increase the quality of the products
delivered to international audiences.

The centre will provde access to methodologies
and guidelines for the verification of standards
compliance and interoperability verification for
linguistic resources in a multilingual, multicultural
and multimodal localisation environment. This
work will be based on industry-standard
approaches and be guided by established principles
and procedures. The reports will be sourced in
cooperation with relevant associations and
standards bodies and public deliverables of
European Union funded projects.

5.3 Localisation scenarios
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935266666667">
The centre will, in consultation with the wider
localisation community, build a laboratory-based,
automated localisation environment mirroring real-
world, authentic localisation scenarios. This
environment will be used to showcase, verify and
demonstrate best practice in localisation making
use of the linguistic resources available through the
centre.
Results from each of these three areas of activity
will be made available to the wider digital content
and localisation communities using different
dissemination strategies. It is envisaged that the
development of a market place for these linguistic
resources will guarantee the sustainability of the
effort.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995815606060606">
We have shown how the needs and requirements
of localisation have developed over the years. The
enormous pressure on localisation providers to
produces language versions of original material
simultaneously with the production and publication
of the original can only be addressed making
efficient and effective use of customised language
resources covering linguistic data, tools and
technologies, and appropriate standards.
Access to language resources for SMEs and the
research community can be realised within a
widely supported Language Resource Centre for
Localisation, built on the foundations of the
Localisation Tools and Technology Laboratory
(LOTS) at the LRC.
The establishment of the Language Resources
Centre for Localisation is a five-year project.
During this time, the LRC plans to create a
sustainable, accessible and financially viable
linguistic infrastructure for the internationalisation
and localisation communities.
Its overall aims are to:
■ Pool together linguistic infrastructure
resources for the localisation industry,
including digital content, monolingual and
multilingual terminology, translation
memories, tools and technologies, as well
as relevant standards.
■ Establish a linguistic resources support
network within the localisation industry
covering digital content publishers, service
providers, technology developers,
standards bodies and standards verification
initiatives.
■ Provide convenient access to relevant
linguistic resources for content developers,
service providers, as well as suppliers of
localisation services and solutions.
■ Develop methodologies for the verification
of standards compliance.
■ Implement localisation scenarios in a
laboratory environment aimed at
demonstrating state-of-the-art, best
practice localisation technology and
process solutions, and at verifying relevant
localisation standards.
■ Work towards the establishment of a
market place and a viable linguistic
resources provider network for the
localisation industry.
Activities during years 1-2 will focus on the
establishment of a repository of linguistic
resources. During this period, the LRC will build a
core group of partners supporting its development.
This core group will be backed by the LRC’s
Contact Group.
Activities during years 3-5 will see the
implementation of a financially viable standards
testing and interoperability verification system at
the LRC. While few commercial organisations
have managed to make a profit to sustain this kind
of activity in other industrial sectors, there is no
doubt that the operation of such a centre is
financially viable long-term in a not-for-profit
environment such as that provided by the LRC at
the University of Limerick.

<abstract confidence="0.9948715">Localisation is one of the fastest growing industrial sectors in the digital world. Since the mid-eighties, the role of localisation has developed and changed dramatically. Localisation has been redefined as the provision of services and technologies for the management of multilinguality across the information flow. paper discusses the need for easily accessible dedicated language resources for localisation, provides a practical example of what can be achieved with appropriate language resources in the context of localisation and proposes a strategy to acquire, maintain and make them easily accessible.</abstract>
