Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999968851851852">
Speakers and listeners make use of a vari-
ety of pragmatic factors to produce and
identify sarcastic statements. It is also
possible that lexical factors play a role, al-
though this possibility has not been inves-
tigated previously. College students were
asked to read excerpts from published
works that originally contained the phrase
said sarcastically, although the word sar-
castically was deleted. The participants
rated the characters’ statements in these
excerpts as more likely to be sarcastic
than those from similar excerpts that did
not originally contain the word sarcasti-
cally. The use of interjections, such as gee
or gosh, predicted a significant amount of
the variance in the participants’ ratings of
sarcastic intent. This outcome suggests
that sarcastic statements may be more
formulaic than previously realized. It also
suggests that computer software could be
written to recognize such lexical factors,
greatly increasing the likelihood that non-
literal intent could be correctly interpreted
by such programs, even if they are unable
to identify the pragmatic components of
nonliteral language.

<bodyText confidence="0.999971538461539">
It has long been assumed that verbal irony, or sar-
casm, is principally a pragmatic phenomenon, and
many studies from psycholinguistics have demon-
strated the social, contextual, and interpersonal
factors that affect its use and interpretation (for
reviews, see Gibbs, 1994, 2003; Giora, 2003).
An example of such a pragmatic factor is com-
mon ground (Clark, 1996). The more familiar two
people are with one other, the more likely it is that
they will employ sarcasm (Kreuz, 1996). When
interlocutors in a story share common ground, ex-
perimental participants read sarcastic statements
more quickly, and are more certain of the sarcastic
intent, than when the interlocutors share little
common ground (Kreuz and Link, 2002). These
results can be explained in terms of a principle of
inferability: speakers will only employ sarcasm if
they are reasonably certain that their hearers will
interpret it correctly (Kreuz, 1996).
Such results have led to pessimistic forecasts
concerning the likelihood that computer programs
would ever be able to understand nonliteral lan-
guage (e.g., Dews and Winner, 1997). If the use of
such language relies solely on pragmatic factors, it
would indeed be a considerable challenge to create
software that could detect and interpret it.
One difficulty with this conclusion is that most
psycholinguistic studies of sarcasm have used ex-
perimenter-generated materials instead of actual
utterances. For example, sarcastic statements are
often hyperbolic (Kreuz and Roberts, 1995), and so
researchers have typically employed extreme con-
structions, such as What perfectly lovely weather!
as sarcastic commentary on a sudden downpour
(Kreuz and Glucksberg, 1989).
Such research, however, has unintentionally con-
founded the pragmatic and the lexical aspects of
sarcasm. It may be the case that particular words or
collocations (e.g., perfectly lovely) serve as a cue

for sarcasm by themselves. Previous research has
not attempted to tease apart these lexical and
pragmatic factors, even though the importance of
lexical factors has been suggested previously.
Kreuz and Roberts (1995) proposed that colloca-
tions consisting of extreme adjectives and adverbs
(e.g., simply amazing, or absolutely fantastic) may
serve as a conventional way of signaling ironic
intent. This idea has been expanded by Utsumi
(2000), who suggested that such verbal cues pro-
vide a way of implicitly displaying negative atti-
tudes via sarcasm.
Of course, interlocutors in face-to-face conversa-
tions can rely upon both verbal and nonverbal cues
to signal ironic intent (e.g., rolling of the eyes,
heavy stress, or slow speaking rate). The authors of
narratives must cue their readers without recourse
to such conventions. The methods used by authors,
therefore, might provide a way to assess the con-
tribution of lexical factors to the perception of sar-
casm.
The goal of the present research was to deter-
mine whether specific lexical factors (e.g., the use
of certain parts of speech, or punctuation) reliably
predict readers’ perceptions of sarcasm. Unlike
most previous research on sarcasm, the experimen-
tal materials were drawn from published narra-
tives.

2.1 Materials
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933039215686">
Google Book Search was used to find instances of
the phrase said sarcastically. This resource, for-
merly known as Google Print, contains more than
100,000 published works that are either in the pub-
lic domain, or have been provided by publishers. A
wide variety of genres is represented (e.g., histori-
cal novels, romance novels, and science fiction).
The phrase said sarcastically was found hun-
dreds of times in the corpus, and 100 of these in-
stances were randomly selected for the study.
Fifteen control texts were also selected at random
from the Google Book Search corpus. Five of the
control items contained the phrase I said, five con-
tained he said, and five contained she said.
In order to create experimental materials, we ex-
cerpted the entire paragraph that the key phrase
appeared in, as well as the two paragraphs of con-
text appearing above and below. The excerpts var-
ied considerably in length, but the mean length for
the 115 excerpts was 110 words (SD = 58).
The phrase that the collocation said sarcasti-
cally referred to was emphasized in bold-faced
type. If the phrase appeared at the end of a sen-
tence, only the words that occurred before it within
quotation marks were made bold. If the sentence
continued after the phrase said sarcastically, the
following words in quotation marks were also
made bold. Finally, the word sarcastically was re-
moved, leaving just the phrase [speaker] said. The
speakers’ statements in the control excerpts were
made bold using the same procedure, ensuring that
the two sets of excerpts were identical in appear-
ance. The mean length of the bold-faced phrases
for all the excerpts was 6.45 words (SD = 8.05).
Each excerpt was printed on a separate page,
along with three questions. The first question asked
How likely is it that the speaker was being sarcas-
tic? A seven-point scale, with endpoints labeled
not at all likely and very likely, appeared below the
question. A second question asked Why do you
think so? Two blank lines were provided for the
participants’ responses. Finally, the participants
were asked How certain are you that the speaker
was being sarcastic? A seven-point scale, with
endpoints labeled not at all certain and very cer-
tain, appeared below the question.
Five different sets of sarcasm excerpts (20 per
set) were created. Booklets were constructed by
randomly interspersing the subset of sarcasm ex-
cerpts with all of the control excerpts. The order of
pages was randomized for each participant.

2.2 Coding

Two judges independently coded the excerpts on
three dimensions:

<listItem confidence="0.962552777777778">
(1) Presence of adjectives and adverbs.
Following Kreuz and Roberts (1995) and Utsumi
(2000), the judges identified the use of adjectives
or adverbs in the bold-faced segments of each ex-
cerpt. The coding was binary: 0 for none, and 1 for
one or more adjectives and adverbs.
(2) Presence of interjections. Certain terms,
such as gee or gosh, are used for the expression of
emotion, and may also serve as a cue for nonliteral

intent. The excerpts were again coded in a binary
fashion.
(3) Use of punctuation. Exclamation points in-
dicate emphasis, which may be a signal of nonlit-
eral intent. Question marks are used in tag
questions (e.g., You really showed him, didn’t
you?), which are often rhetorical and nonliteral
(Kreuz et al., 1999). The use of either an exclama-
tion point or question mark was coded in a binary
fashion.
The agreement between the judges’ coding was
95% across all excerpts. The small number of dis-
agreements was primarily the result of variability
in how dictionaries define interjections. All dis-
agreements were resolved through discussion.

2.3 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998075">
Participants were 101 undergraduates at a large
public university. They received course credit for
their participation. The participants were tested in
small groups, and asked to work through the book-
lets at their own pace. Each participant read and
answered questions for 35 excerpts: 20 sarcasm
excerpts, and all 15 control excerpts (only a subset
of the sarcasm materials was given to each partici-
pant to offset fatigue effects).
The term sarcasm was not defined for the par-
ticipants, and they were asked to rely solely on
their intuitive understanding of the term. (Previous
research with the same population suggests that a
fairly high level of agreement exists for the con-
cept of sarcasm; see Kreuz, Dress, and Link,
2006).

3 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999985711111111">
Only the responses from the first question (likeli-
hood that the speaker is being sarcastic) will be
discussed here. For each participant, a mean score
for the 100 sarcasm and 15 control excerpts was
computed. As expected, the sarcasm excerpts re-
ceived higher scores (M = 4.85, SD = .67) than the
control excerpts (M = 2.89, SD = .86), and the dif-
ference was significant, t (100) = 19.35, p &lt; .001.
This means that the participants had sufficient con-
text for determining sarcastic intent in the test ex-
cerpts, and that the participants were able to
distinguish between the two groups of excerpts.
To determine the relative importance of the lexi-
cal factors on the perception of sarcasm, a regres-
sion analysis was performed. The criterion variable
was the mean sarcasm rating for each excerpt. Five
predictor variables were employed: (1) the number
of words in each excerpt, (2) the number of bold-
faced words in each excerpt, (3) the presence of
adjectives and adverbs, (4) the presence of interjec-
tions, and (5) the use of exclamation points and
question marks. Variables 3 to 5 were coded in a
binary fashion, as described in section 2.2. Ratings
for both the sarcastic and the control excerpts were
entered.
The number of words and number of bold-faced
words are theoretically uninteresting variables, so
they were forced into the equation first as one
block. The three predictor variables of interest
were entered in a second block using a stepwise
method.
The first block, containing the two length vari-
ables, failed to account for a significant amount of
the variance, F (2,112) = 1.37, n.s., R2 = .024. This
was a desirable outcome, because it meant that par-
ticipants were not influenced in their judgments by
the lengths of the excerpts they were reading, with
longer excerpts providing more contextual cues.
For the second block with the three variables of
interest, only the presence of interjections entered
into the equation, F (1, 111) = 6.10, p = .015, R2 =
.051. The presence of adjectives and adverbs, and
the use of punctuation, failed to predict a signifi-
cant amount of the variance in the participants’
ratings of sarcastic intent.

Previous theory and research has largely ignored
the potential role of lexical factors in the delivery
and detection of sarcasm. This bias has been rein-
forced by the use of experimenter-generated mate-
rials that may have obscured the contributions
made by these factors. This study is the first to as-
sess the importance of such lexical factors, using
ecologically valid materials.
On the one hand, the amount of variance ac-
counted for by lexical factors was rather small: just
5%. On the other hand, it must be remembered that
the excerpts themselves were taken from book-
length works, so the participants only had a frac-
tion of the original context with which to deter-
mine the intent of the (potentially) sarcastic
statement. Nevertheless, the participants were able
to reliably differentiate between the sarcastic and
