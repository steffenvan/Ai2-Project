We propose a novel knowledge-rich approach to measuring the
similarity between a pair of words. The algorithm is tailored to
Bulgarian and Russian and takes into account the orthographic
and the phonetic correspondences between the two Slavic lan-
guages: it combines lemmatization, hand-crafted transformation
rules, and weighted Levenshtein distance. The experimental re-
sults show an 11-pt interpolated average precision of 90.58%,
which represents a sizeable improvement over two classic
rivaling approaches.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997095">
We propose an algorithm that measures the extent to
which a Bulgarian and a Russian word are perceived as
similar by a person who is fluent in both languages.
Leaving aside the full orthographical identity, we assume
that words with different orthography can be also
perceived as similar when they have the same or a similar
stem and inflections, as in the Bulgarian word
афектирахме and the Russian аффектировались (both
meaning ‘we were affected’).
Bulgarian and Russian are closely related Slavonic
languages with rich morphology, which motivates us to
study the typical orthographical correspondences between
their lexical entries (conditioned phonetically and mor-
phologically), which we use to formulate and apply trans-
formation rules for bringing a Russian word close to
Bulgarian reading and vice versa. Our algorithm for
measuring the similarity between Bulgarian and Russian
words first reduces the Russian word to an intermediate
Bulgarian-sounding form and then compares it orthogra-
phically to the Bulgarian word. The algorithm starts by
transliterating the Russian word with the Bulgarian
alphabet, and then transforms some typical Russian
morphemes and word parts (e.g., prefixes, suffixes,
endings, etc.) to their Bulgarian counter-parts. Since both
Bulgarian and Russian are highly-inflectional languages,
lemmatization is used to convert the wordforms to their
lemmata in order to reduce the differences at the morpho-
logical level. Finally, the orthographic similarity is measu-
red using a modified Levenshtein distance with letter-
specific substitution weights.

2.1. Transliteration from Cyrillic to Cyrillic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999309">
In a strict linguistic sense, transcription is the process of
transition from sounds to letters, i.e., from speech to text;
it is carried out generally in a monolingual context. In a
bilingual context, the notion of transliteration is used to
denotе the transition of sounds and their letter correspon-
dences in one language to letters in another language. The
term transliteration is commonly used for the transition of
letters when the two languages use different alphabets. In
this paper, we deal with transliteration since we work
with written texts.
The linguistic objective of our investigation is to intro-
duce more formal criteria to the investigation of possible
cognates between Russian and Bulgarian. By cognates we
mean words with equal or close orthography denoting the
same meaning; words with equal/close orthography but
different meaning are false cognates/friends. For their
further investigation in multilingual research, we need to
define the exact expression of that identity/closeness by
particular metrics and procedures.
For a pair of languages from different families, the
source of cognates is borrowing between them or from a
third language. Besides borrowing, an essential source of
cognates in related languages is their common protolan-
guage. However, in the historical development of both
languages, three factors lead to different grapheme shape
for fully identical words: (1) language-specific phonetic
laws and resulting changes, (2) settings of the spelling
systems regulating the sound-letter transition, and (3)
divergence in the grammatical systems and the grammati-
cal formatives.

2.1.2 Regular letter transitions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863166666667">
Replacing Russian letters that are missing in the Bulgari-
an alphabet. The transitions discussed here stem from
historic differences in the phonetic and the spelling sys-
tems of the two languages. Bulgarian and Russian differ in
their contemporary phonetic system mainly at the level of
pronunciation; in the distinction of soft and hard conso-
nants. The Russian-specific letters ы and э serve to denote
the variant of a ‘hard consonant+и/е’ while in Bulgarian
all consonants preceding и and е are soft. This basic
difference of the phonetic systems gives us the regular
correspondence ы-и and э-е in all Russian-Bulgarian
cognates containing these two letters, e.g., рыба – риба,
поэт- поет.
Removing a Russian letter. Another regular phonetic dif-
ference between the two languages, which is also related
to the opposition soft/hard, is the allowed softness of a
consonant preceding another consonant (пальто) or in
final position (шесть). Such phonetic combinations are
not allowed in Bulgarian: see the corresponding палто
and шест. This regularity allows us to remove all Russian
ь in these positions in the initial stage of the process of
cognate comparison.
Partial regularity of the letter transitions. In non-initial
positions, other not so regular but repeated letter corres-
pondences can be observed, e.g., е-я in хлеб-хляб, е-ъ in
серп-сърп, о-ъ in сон-сън, у-ъ in муж-мъж, etc. The
iterativity of such transitions is due to the specific
development of the spelling systems in the two languages.
One such example is the disappearance of some Old
Slavic letters and their regular replacement with different
letters in Russian and Bulgarian. The above-mentioned
change у-ъ is due to the disappearance of an Old Slavic
letter called ‘big yus’ and its regular replacement by
different vowels in all contemporary Slavic languages.
The transition is only partially regular since not all occur-
rences of the letter have the same etymological origin.

2.1.3 Tranformations of ngrams
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998584">
The sound-letter transition legitimated by the spelling ru-
les of the two languages is specific as well; its specificity
is observed at the level of the grapheme composition of
the full cognates, i.e., those that are borrowed from third
languages or that are identical morphologically.

Transformations originating from spelling.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962461538461">
A fundamental difference between Russian and Bulga-
rian spellings is the treatment of double consonants.
Russian allows them in every part of the word structure,
while in Bulgarian they are only possible at the morpheme
boundary. Thus, all words borrowed from third languages
keep their double consonants in Russian, but lose them in
Bulgarian, e.g., процесс – процес, аффект – афект,
etc. In this way, a regular transition ll-l can be formulated
for all double consonants with the following stipulation of
grammatical origin.
In words of Slavic origin, consonant doubling occurs
mainly at the morpheme boundary, but in Russian the
phenomenon is more frequent since Russian spelling rules
are more “phonetic”. For example, they reflect the change
voiced-voiceless for all prefixes ending with з and
preceding the initial с of the next morpheme. Bulgarian
spelling is more ‘morphological’ and conservative; it
keeps the з in writing, although it is voiceless in
pronunciation, e.g., рассуждение – разсъждение,
бессмертный – безсмъртен, etc. This transformation of
hard-soft consonants in the final prefix position is only
valid for the couple з-с. Thus, the Bulgarian-Russian
transition зс-сс can be formulated as regular for prefixes
only and cannot be viewed as a universal for other parts of
the word, e.g., кавказcкий – кавказки.
Next, the following general question in treating double
consonant correspondences arises: if we want to stay in
the domain of uni- and bigram transformations, removing
the second consonant in Russian can be ambiguous
поддержать – поддържам, but буддист – будист,
вводить – въвеждам, раввин – равин. The legal
consonant doublings in Bulgarian can be only outlined in
a larger context – a window of up to five letters, contai-
ning the prefix and the next consonant, as in предд, надд,
подд, изз, разз, etc., where the second consonant should
be preserved. Note that these exceptions from the rule are
only valid for double д, з and в – final letter of prefixes,
and for н – first letter of the affix н, e.g., непременно –
непременно, but аннотация – анотация. .

Transformations of morphological origin.

<bodyText confidence="0.999921916666667">
In addition to the divergent development of phonetic
and spelling systems, the two languages develop different
grammatical systems, both at a systemic and at a morphe-
mic level – different categories with different graphemic
expressions. That divergence leads to different grapheme
shapes for words that are lexically conceived as cognates,
e.g., жены – жената, and the difference is manifested in
the ending part of the word, consisting of affixes, and
ending and related to grammatical forms.
The transformations are made in two directions and for
both languages. They can consist of removal of a letter
sequence or its transformation.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.607278" genericHeader="method">
1. Removing agglutinative morphemes.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808">
Each of the two languages has one agglutinative me-
chanism of word formation (but for different parts of
speech) – the reflexive morpheme ся and сь in Russian
verb conjugation and the postpositioned article in Bulgari-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995178">

<bodyText confidence="0.999970291666667">
an in nominal inflections (for nouns and adjectives). The
corresponding grammatical meanings are expressed in the
twin language by other means (the article is totally
missing in Russian and the reflexivity of verbs is expres-
sed by a lexical element in Bulgarian – the particle се).
Thus, removing these morphemes is the first step in the
process of conversion to an intermediate form, e.g.,
веселиться – веселить, квадратът – квадрат. Note
that the Russian agglutinative morpheme ся/сь at the end
of the word are non-ambigous: all 212,000 wordforms
with the ending ся in our Russian grammatical dictionary
are reflexive verb forms. This is not the case with the
Bulgarian article, where only removing the morpheme ът
for masculin is non-ambiguous, while removing та, ят
and other article morpheme can trim the stem, e.g., жена-
та, but квадрат-а. We intentionally do not derive a
transformation rule from the last correspondence.
Removing Bulgarian articles depends on the accepted
conception about the place of lemmatization in the
algorithm – should we set the orthographic similarity for
all four members of the language pair – lemmata and
wordforms – or should we measure the similarity at the le-
xical level only – the lemmata. In the latter case, no remo-
val is necessary (see 1.3)

2. Transforming ending strings.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995773666666667">
There is a big group of adjectives in the two langua-
ges derived from other parts of speech and formed with
the suffix н and an adjectival ending, e.g., шум –
шумный, шум – шумен. When the adjective is derived
from a noun ending with н, we get a doubled н in the
Russian lemma and in the Bulgarian wordforms, e.g.,
гарнизон-гарнизонный and гарнизон – гарнизонни.
Another regular correspondence is manifested in the word
derivation with the suffix ск. All these combinations of
н/нн/ск and different adjectival endings give the
correspondences shown in Table 1.

Concerning the transformation of endings, it is impor-
tant to note that two linguistic problems are interrelated
here: (1) the formal revelation of the morpheme boundary,
and (2) the correct correspondence with the Bulgarian
ending. The existing ambiguity in resolving these two
problems requires serious statistical investigations before
the rules can be formulated.
With ambiguity not taken into account, the proposed
transformation rules for Russian word endings could
sometimes generate the wrong Bulgarian wordform, e.g.,
висеть could become висея, while the correct Bulgarian
form is вися. In order to limit the negative impact of that,
we measure the similarity (1) with and (2) without
applying rules for lemmatization; we then return the
higher value of the two.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990391">
2.2. Lemmatization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973357142857">
Bulgarian and Russian are highly-inflectional languages,
i.e., they use variety of endings to express the different
forms of the same word. When measuring orthographic
similarity, endings could cause major problems since they
can make two otherwise very similar words appear
somewhat different. For example, the Bulgarian word
отправената (‘the directed’, a feminine adjective with a
definite article) and the Russian word отправленному
(‘the directed’, a masculine adjective in dative case)
exhibit only about 50% letter overlap, but, if we ignore
the endings, the similarity between them becomes much
bigger. Thus, if our algorithm could safely ignore word
endings when comparing words, it might perform better.
If we could remove the ending, the similarity would be
measured using the stem, which is the invariable part of
the word. Unfortunately, both the ending as a letter
sequence and the location of the morpheme boundary are
quite ambiguous in both languages. Thus, we need to
lemmatize the text, i.e., convert the word to its main form,
the lemma. If every member of the pair of candidate
cognates from L1 and L2 is represented by a wordform
(WF) and its lemma (L), then we could compare: L1 with
L2, WF1 with WF2, L1 with WF2 and WF1 with L2.
Considering these four options, we can get a better
estimation for the similarity not only between close
wordforms like the Bulgarian отправената and the Rus-
sian отправленному, which look different orthographi-
cally, but have very close lemmata, but also between such

<bodyText confidence="0.99995275">
very different words like the Bulgarian къпейки
(‘bathing’, a gerund) and the Russian копейки (‘copeck’,
plural feminine noun).
The lemmatization of the Bulgarian and the Russian
words can be done using specialized dictionaries. In the
present work, we will use two large grammatical dictiona-
ries that contain words, their lemmata, and some
grammatical information.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989454">
2.3. Transformation Weights
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982186957446809">
Let us now come back to the transliteration rules and to
the next steps in our algorithm. There are orthographical
correspondences between candidate cognates that are not
as undisputable as the general rules, but are still observed
in the development of the languages, at least for ones with
a proven etymological basis. As was shown above, the re-
gular correspondences between the languages can be due
to phonetic and spelling reasons. Besides the uncon-
ditional letters transitions described above, not so regular
ones occur in several cases, and their existence can be
taken into account when constructing the weight scale for
measuring similarity.
A general principle when building a weight scale is
that the correspondences between letters denoting conso-
nants and vowels (hereinafter ‘vowels’ and ‘consonants’
only) should be measured separately. The maximal
ortographic distance between different letters is 1 (as for
а-ц) and the maximal similarity has weight 0 (as for а-а).
All weight values between 0 and 1 are assigned to letter
correspondences that exist in a non-regular way in some
cognates (the above-mentioned correspondence у-ъ was
due to etymological reasons). Another general admission
is that consonants and vowels with similar sequences of
distinctive phonetic features (differing only in the place of
articulation or in the presence/absence of voice, e.g., б-в,
б-п) have lower weight distance. The same is valid for the
pair of letters denoting a regular phonetic change, e.g.,
reduction (as in а-ъ, оy) or softening of the preceding
consonant (as in у-ю, а-я). Regular correspondences
observed in a limited lexical sector (e.g., borrowed from
Latin and Greek) such as г-х also have a lower distance.
Table 3 shows the letter transformation weights, which
can be used to measure the orthographic similarity after
the Bulgarian and Russian words have been transliterated
to a subset of the Cyrillic alphabet.
The weights w(a, b) are used to transform the letter a
into the letter b and vice versa. This weight function w is
symmetric by definition, i.e., w(a, b) = w(b, a). All other
weights not given in Table 3 are equal to 1.
In order to write the Russian words in the modified
Bulgarian alphabet used in Table 3, we make the follow-
ing preliminary transformations for all Russian words:
э → е; ы → и; ь → (empty letter); ъ → (empty letter)
Table 3 shapes the match between letters and the so-
unds they denote in Bulgarian and Russian. It further cor-
relates weights for letter transformation that have been
phonetically justified.

The MMEDR algorithm (modified minimum edit distance
ratio) measures the orthographic similarity between a pair
of Bulgarian and Russian words using some general
phonetic and morphologically conditioned
correspondences between the letters of the two languages
in order to estimate the extent to which the two words
would be perceived as similar by people fluent in both
languages. It returns a value between 0 and 1, where
values close to 1 express very high similarity, while 0 is
returned for completely dissimilar words. The algorithm
has been tailored for Bulgarian and Russian and thus is
not directly applicable to other pairs of languages. Howe-
ver, the general approach can be easily adapted to other
languages: all that has to be changed are the rules descri-
bing the phonetic and the morphological correspondences.

dictionary of Bulgarian as described in Section 1.3. If the
dictionary contains no lemmata for the target word, the
original word is returned; if it contains more than one

3.2. Transforming the Russian Ending
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871666666666">
At this step, we transform the endings of the Russian word
according to Tables 1 and 2 and we remove the
agglutinative suffix ся:
нный → нен; ный → ен; нний → нен; ний → ен; ий
→ и; ый → и; нной → нен; ной → -ен; ой → и; ский
- ски; ься → ь; овать → ам; ить → я; ять → я;
ать → ам; уть → а; еть → ея
The substitutions rules are applied only if the left hand-
side letter sequences are at the end of the word. Rules are
applied in the given order; multiple rule applications are
allowed. Note that we do not have rules for all possible
endings in Russian, but only for the typical ones – object
of transformation for adjectives and verbs.
Since all words have been already lemmatized in the
previous step (if applied), verbs are assumed to be in
infinitive and adjectives in singular masculine form.
Adjective endings are transformed to their respective
Bulgarian counter-parts, and reflexive verbs are turned
into non-reflexive. Nouns are not considered since they
generally have the same endings in the two languages
(after having been lemmatized) and thus need no
additional transformations.
Of course, there are many exceptions for the above
rules, but our experiments show that using each of them
has more positive than negative effect. Initially, we tried
using few more additional rules, which were subsequently
removed since they were found to be harmful.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978555555555">
Given two words, the Levenshtein distance [Levenshtein,
1965], also known as the minimum edit distance (MED),
is defined as the minimum total number of single-letter
substitutions, deletions and/or insertions necessary to
convert the first word into the second one. We use a
modification, which we call modified minimum edit
distance (MMED), where the weights of all insertions and
deletions are fixed to 1, and the weights for single-letter
substitution are as given in Table 3.

At this step, we calculate MMEDR value by normalizing
MMED – we divide it by the length of the longer word
(the length is calculated after all transformations have
been made in the previous steps). We use the following
formula:

The final result is given by the maximum of the obtained
values for all eight variants of the MMEDR algorithm –
with/without lemmatization of the Bulgarian word,
with/without lemmatization of the Russian word, and
with/without transformation of the Russian word ending.
Note also, that lemmatization steps might result in
calculating additional values for MMEDR – one for each
possible lemma of the Russian/Bulgarian word.

3.7. Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849">
As we will see below, the proposed MMEDR algorithm
yields significant improvements over classic orthographic
similarity measures like LCSR (longest common
subsequence ratio, defined as the longest common letter
subsequence, normalized by the length of the longer word
[Melamed, 1999]) and MEDR (minimum edit distance

ratio, defined as the Levenshtein distance with all weights
set to 1, normalized by the length of the longer word, also
known as normalized edit distance /NED/ [Marzal &amp;
Vidal, 1993]). This is due to the above-described steps
which turn the Russian word into a Bulgarian-sounding
one and the application of letter substitution weights that
reflect the closeness of the corresponding phonemes.
Let us consider for example the Bulgarian word
agbexmupaxue and the Russian word agbgbexmupoeanuca.
Using the classic Levenshtein distance, we obtain the
following: MED(agbexmupaxMe, agbgbexmupoeanuca) = 7.
And after normalization: MEDR=1–(7/15) = 8/15 ≈ 53%.
In contrast, with the MMEDR algorithm, we first
lemmatize the two words, thus obtaining agbexmupa.0 and
agbgbexmupoeama respectively. We then replace the
double Russian consonant -gbgb- by -gb- and the Russian
ending -oeama by the first singular Bulgarian verb ending
-am. We thus obtain the intermediate forms agbexmupau
and agbexmupa.u, which are identical, and MMEDR =
100%. Note that some pairs of words like agbexmupaxMe
and agbgbexmupoeanuca could be neither orthographically
nor phonetically close but could be perceived as similar
due to cross-lingual correspondences that are obvious to
people speaking both languages.
Let us take another example – with the Bulgarian word
u36qeau and the Russian word om6eeama (both meaning
‘to run out’), which sound similarly. Using Levenshtein
distance: MED(us6qzau,om6eaama) = 5 and thus MEDR
= 1 – (5/8) = 3/8 = 37.5%. In contrast, with the MMEDR
algorithm, we first transform om6eeama to its intermediate
form om6eeam and we then calculate MMED(us6qza.u,
om6eeaM) = 0.8 + 1 + 0.5 = 2.3 and MMEDR = 1 –
(2.3/7) = 47/70 ≈ 67%, which is a much better reflection
of the similarity between the two words.
Thus, we can conclude that, at least in the above two
examples, the traditional MEDR does not work well for
the highly inflectional Bulgarian and Russian. MEDR is
based on the classic Levenshtein distance, which uses the
same weight for all letter substitution, and thus cannot
distinguish small phonetic changes like replacing q with e
(two phonetically very close vowels) from more
significant differences like replacing q with a (a vowel and
a consonant that are quite different).

were annotated as very similar by a linguist who was
fluent in Russian and a native speaker of Bulgarian; the
remaining 39,837 were considered unrelated.

designated by the linguist would be ranked at the top. We
can determine how well the ranking produced by our
algorithm does using standard measures from information
retrieval, e.g. 11-point interpolated average precision
[Manning et al., 2008].
We compared the MMEDR algorithm with two classic
orthographic similarity measures: LCSR and MEDR.
Unfortunately, we could not directly compare our results
to those in other work, since there were no previous
publications measuring orthographic or phonetic similari-
ty between words in Bulgarian and Russian.

5. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96023224137931">
As Tables 4 and 5 show, the MMEDR algorithm works
quite well. Still, there is a lot of room for improvement:
• Bulgarian and Russian inflectional morphologies are
quite complex, with many exceptions that are not
captured by our rules. This is probably a limitation
of the general approach rather than a deficiency of
the particular rules used: if we are to capture all
exceptions, we would need to manually specify them
all, which would require a lot of extra manual work.
• The transformation rules between Bulgarian and
Russian are sometimes imprecise as well, e.g., for
very short words or for words of foreign origin.
• While linguistically motivated, the letter-for-letter
substitution weights we used are ad hoc, and could
be improved. First, while we used symmetric letter
substitution weight in Table 3, asymmetric weights
might work better, e.g. the Bulgarian prefixes раз-
and uз- are spelled as рас- and uс- in Russian when
followed by a voiceless consonant. Thus, the
substiution weight for з → с should probably be
higher than for c → з. We could further extend the
rules to take into account the local context, e.g.,
changing раз- to рас- could have a different weight
than changing -з- то -с- in general.
• Another potential problem comes from us using only
one linguist for the annotation, which might have
yielded biased judgments. To assess the impact of
the potential subjectivity, we would need judgments
by at least one additional linguist.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823977272727">
Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature for
measuring the orthographic and the phonetic similarity
between pairs of words from different languages.
The simplest ones considered as orthographically close
words with identical prefixes [Simard &amp; al., 1992].
Much more popular have been orthographic similarity
measures based on normalized versions of the Levenshtein
distance [Levenshtein, 1965], the longest common
subsequence [Melamed, 1999], and the Dice coefficient
[Brew and McKelvie, 1996].
Somewhat less common have been phonetic similarity
measures, which compare sounds instead of letter sequen-
ces. Such an approach has been proposed for the first time
by [Russel, 1918]. Guy [1994] described an algorithm for
cognate identification in bilingual word lists based on
statistics of common sound correspondences. Algorithms
that learn the typical sound correspondences between two
languages automatically have also been proposed:
[Kondrak, 2000], [Kondrak, 2003] and [Kondrak &amp; Dorr,
2004].
Instead of applying similarity measures for symbolic
strings on the words directly, some researchers have first
performed transformations that reflect the typical cross-
lingual orthographic and phonetic correspondences betwe-
en the target languages. This is especially important for
language pairs where some letters in the source language
are systematically substituted by other letters in the target
language. The idea can be extended further with
substitutions of whole syllables, prefixes and suffixes. For
example, Koehn &amp; Knight [2002] proposed manually
constructed transformation rules from German to English
(e.g., the letters k and z are changed to c; and the ending -
tät is changed to -ty) in order to expand lists of
automatically extracted cognates.
Finally, orthographic measures like LCSR and MEDR
have gradually evolved over the years, enriched by
machine learning techniques that automatically identify
templates for cross-lingual orthographic and phonetic
correspondences. For example, Tiedemann [1999] learned
spelling transformations from English to Swedish, while
Mulloni &amp; Pekar [2006] and Mitkov &amp; al. [2007] learned
transformation templates, which represent substitutions of
letters sequences in one language with letter sequences in
another language.

7. Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998275">
We have described and tested a novel algorithm for mea-
suring the similarity between pairs of words based on
transformation rules between Bulgarian and Russian. The
algorithm has shown very high precision and could be
used to identify possible candidates for cognates or false
friends in text corpora. It can also be used in machine
translation systems working on related languages where it
could help overcome the incompleteness of translation
dictionaries used in the system.
There are many ways in which we could improve the
proposed algorithm. For example, we could adapt the al-
gorithms described in [Mitkov et al., 2007] and [Bergsma
&amp; Kondrak, 2007] to Bulgarian and Russian and try to
learn cross-lingual transformation rules for morphemes
and other sub-word sequences automatically. We could
then try to combine MMEDR with such rules.
