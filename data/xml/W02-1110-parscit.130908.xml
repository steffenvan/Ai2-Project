Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999919555555555">
Many NLP systems are based on lexical
data. The development costs of such data
are a major drawback in such NLP systems.
In order to cut these costs, we adopt a
strategy inspired from &amp;quot;open-source&amp;quot;
projects to allow volunteers to collaborate
in the creation of a multilingual lexical
database.
For this, we had to specify and develop
tools to manage a lexical database
containing information complete and
detailed enough to be usable for a wide
range of applications.
This paper presents our project and details
the tools, frameworks and structures used
to manage such a database. We will also
show some research problems still to be
addressed in this context.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999480888888889">
Many NLP systems are based on lexical data.
The development costs of such data are a major
drawback in such NLP systems. Furthermore, the
existing lexical data have generally been
developed for a specific purpose and can’t be
reused easily in other applications.
The Papillon project applies some tools and
methods to develop multipurpose, multilingual
lexical data collaboratively on Internet. This data
is complete and detailed enough to be eventually
used either by NLP systems (MT engines for
example) or by human users (language learners,
translators...).
After presenting the motivations of the Papillon
project, we will show the management of existing
data. Then we will describe the structure of the
Papillon dictionary, and the tools that are used to
allow contributions from Internet volunteers.

1.1.1 A Lack of Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950636363636">
On the Internet, a lot of free dictionaries are
available but very few of them imply more than 2
languages. Most of these dictionaries include
English as one of their languages.
Furthermore, the existing dictionaries often lack
information essential for beginners or NLP
systems.
Another point contributing to this lack: the high
costs of development of large lexical resources
for NLP involves also a high price, dissuasive for
the end-user.

1.1.2 Existing Structures and Tools for
Multilingual Dictionaries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999495">
Some partners of the Papillon project have been
involved in research on the definition of
structures and tools to handle multilingual lexical
databases.
They were looking for an opportunity to apply
their research results on real scale lexical data.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.6823825">
1.1.3 Collaborative Development on the
Internet
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953814814815">
Most partners were participating, as computer
scientists, in the development of open source
products. With the democratisation of Internet
access in a lot of countries, came the opportunity
to apply the open source principles to the
development of a multipurpose, multilingual
lexical database.
Cooperation projects for bilingual dictionaries
are already going on such as EDICT, a
Japanese-English dictionary lead by Jim Breen
(2001) for more than 10 years and more recently,
SAIKAM, a Japanese-Thai dictionary (see
Ampornaramveth (2000)).
With the Papillon project, the dictionary is
extended to a multilingual lexical database.
Volunteers will find lexicons developed by
others and some tools to complete or correct the
Papillon multilingual dictionary. Users will also
be able to define their own personal views of the
database.
Mathieu Mangeot-Lerebours (2001) defines a
complete framework for the consultation and the
construction of dictionaries. The framework is
completely generic in order to manage
heterogeneous dictionaries with their own proper
structures. This framework is extensively used in
Papillon project.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.8971">
1.2.1 Dictionary Markup Language (DML)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9660735">
The framework consists in the definition of an
XML namespace1 called DML (Dictionary
Markup Language). All lexical data of a lexical
database can be described with DML elements.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999588">
Figure 1. The DML Framework

<bodyText confidence="0.999628125">
The entire hierarchy of the XML files, elements
and attributes is described using XML schemata
and grouped into the DML namespace. Figure 1
describes the organisation of the main DML
elements.
The XML schemata are available online. This
allows users to edit and validate their files online
with an XML schema validator.

many different dictionary structures. Indeed, two
dictionary structures can be radically different. In
order to handle such heterogeneous structures

represent the same lexical information. This
subset is called Common Dictionary Markup
(CDM). This set is in constant evolution. If the
same kind of information is found in several
dictionaries then a new element representing this
piece of information is added to the CDM set. It
allows tools to have access to common
information in heterogeneous dictionaries by way
of pointers into the structures of the dictionaries.

1.3 Three Layers for the Lexical Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996395">
The lexical data repository of the Papillon project
is divided into 4 subdirectories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999736">
• Administration contains guidelines and
administrative files
• Hell (data in original format)
• Purgatory (data in XML &amp; UTF-8)
• Paradise (data in Papillon format)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998516">
The name of the files and directories is
normalised in order to allow easy navigation into
the repository.
All lexical data stored in the repository is free of
rights or protected by a GPL-like licence.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.910276">
1.3.1 Hell Directory
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999856">
This directory contains lexical data in their
original format. When a dictionary is received, it
is first stored there while waiting to be “recycled”.
For each dictionary, we create a metadata file
containing all available information concerning
the dictionary (name, languages covered,
creation date, size, authors, domain, etc.). It is
then used to evaluate the quality of the dictionary
and to guide the recycling process. These
dicitonaries are freely downloadable as they are.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.962532">
1.3.2 Purgatory Directory
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999428125">
The Purgatory directory receives the lexical data
once the recuperation process is over. This
process consists in converting the lexical data
from its original format into XML encoded in
UTF-8. To perform this task, we use the
RECUPDIC methodology described in
Doan-Nguyen (1998) regular expression tools
like Perl scripts.
If a dictionary is already encoded in XML, the
recuperation process consists in mapping the
elements of information into CDM elements and
storing the correspondence into the metadata file.
Internet users access these dictionaries as
classical online dictionaries, retrieving individual
entries by way of requests on the Papillon web
site.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.880192">
1.3.3 Paradise Directory
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925769230769">
The Paradise directory contains only one
dictionary often called the &amp;quot;Papillon dictionary&amp;quot;.
This dictionary has a particular DML structure.
Internet users access entries of this dictionary by
way of requests to the Papillon web site.
It is possible to retrieve only one entry, or any
subset of entries in any available output format.
The “native” format is the Papillon textual XML
DML format in UTF-8. Users also have ways to
add new entries or correct existing ones online.
Other purgatory dictionaries may be integrated
into the Papillon dictionary with the help of the
CDM elements.

2 The Papillon Multilingual
Dictionary

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996996">
2.1 Macrostructure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998395">
The architecture of the Papillon multilingual
dictionary is based on Gilles Sérasset (1994) and
has been prototyped by Blanc (1999). This
architecture uses a pivot structure based on
multiple monolingual volumes linked to an
interlingual acception volume.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999699">
Figure 2. Illustration of Papillon&apos;s macrostructure.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999572385964912">
Each entry of a monolingual volume represents a
word sense. In this document, we use the term of
“lexie” as in the Explanatory and Combinatory
Dictionary to name a monolingual entry. The
meaning of “lexie” is not the same as “lexeme”.
A lexie is a complete monolingual entry.
The interlingual volume gathers all the
interlingual acceptions. An interlingual acception
represents the union of word-senses or “lexies”
considered as “equivalent” among different
monolingual volumes. This equivalence is
calculated from translation links. In this
document, we use the term of “axie” to name an
interlingual acception.
Real contrastive problems in lexical equivalence
(not to be confused with monolingual polysemy,
homonymy or synonymy as clearly explained in
Mel&apos;cuk and Wanner (2001) are
handled by way of a special kind
of link between axies. Figure 2
illustrates this architecture using a
classical example involving
&amp;quot;Rice&amp;quot; in 4 languages. In this
example, we used the word senses
as given by the &amp;quot;Petit Robert&amp;quot;
dictionary for French and the
&amp;quot;Longman Dictionary of
Contemporary English&amp;quot; for
English. As shown, the French and
English dictionaries do not make
any word sense distinction
between cooked and uncooked
rice seeds. However, this
distinction is clearly made in
Japanese and Malay. No axie may
be used to denote the union of the
word senses for Malay &amp;quot;nasi&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;beras&amp;quot; unless we want to consider
them as true synonyms in Malay
(which would be false). Hence, we
have to create 3 different axies:
one for the union of &amp;quot;nasi&amp;quot; and 御
飯 (gohan), the other for the union
of &amp;quot;beras&amp;quot; and 米 (kome) and one
for the union of &amp;quot;rice&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;riz&amp;quot;. A
link (non-continuous line in Figure
1 has to be added between the third
axies and the others in order to
keep the translation equivalence
between the word-senses.
Note that the links between axies
do not bear any particular
semantics and should not be
confused with some kind of
ontological links.
Bilingual dictionaries can be obtained from the
multilingual dictionary.

The structure of the lexies (units of the
monolingual dictionaries) is based on Polguère
(2000) and Mel&apos;cuk’s work on the combinatorial
and explanatory lexicography, a part of the
meaning-text theory. An XML schema using the
DML framework has been defined to represent
this structure as accurately as possible.
This structure is common to all the monolingual
dictionaries. In order to cope with language

For the external user, the Papillon project is
viewed as a dynamic web site providing access
the existing dictionaries and giving ways to
contribute to the Papillon dictionary.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997648">
3.1 General Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789">
The Papillon web site is built with a Java based
open source framework called Enhydra2. It is
designed around a standard 3-tier architecture
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7294113">
• a presentation layer in charge of the
interface with the user. We currently use
classical HTML/CSS rendering, but plan to
integrate WML access to the dictionaries

currently use XML data (in UTF-8) and
XSL transformations for data manipulation,
• a data layer in charge of the communication

with the database via a JDBC driver. The
data layer should be managed by an XML
database allowing language dependent
sorting. For the moment, XML databases are
still in an early stage. In order to advance in
the project, a mapping system for DML has
been defined in order to store the XML data
into conventional relational databases.
PostgreSQL is used at this point.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998253">
3.2 Particular features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972087153846154">
As different users may have different needs
(translators, learners...) we define different
views of the Papillon dictionary. Each view is
2 available at www.enhydra.org
encoded as a XSL stylesheet that is applied on the
result of each user query. In the future, we will
also allow users to define their own custom views
and store them on the server. All these
transformations are done on the server in order to
allow users to use their preferred browser (even if
it is not XML aware). Figure 4 shows an example
of the French entry &amp;quot;MEURTRE&amp;quot; (murder)
viewed as in Mel&apos;cuk&apos;s DEC dictionary.

To avoid the unintentional pollution of the
database by erroneous data, the contributions of a
user are to be validated by a central group of
trusted users. In the mean time, the contributions
are stored as XSL stylesheets in the cntributor’s
private space.
Each time a user requests a corresponding entry,
the request is performed in the main database and
in the user space. The results from the user space
are used to modify results from the main database.
This way, the contribution is immediately visible
to the user exactly as if it had been integrated into
the main database.
While contributions are waiting to be validated
and integrated into the common space, The
contributors may choose to share them with other
users or groups of users.
Every user can contribute at his/her level. For
example, a linguist specialist of lexical functions
will enter values of lexico-semantic functions, a
phonologist pronunciations and a professional
bilingual translator will enter new interlingual
links or check the semi-automatically generated
ones. For this, different interfaces will be
developed to accommodate the various user
profiles.

3.3 Annex Tools
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927791666667">
As the web site hosts a rather complex
collaborative work, we have added some tools
that are not related to lexicography, but that have
to work in a multilingual context.
First, there is a tool to archive our Papillon
mailing list. Such a tool is very common on
Internet sites. However, as we found out, these
tools may not be used in our multilingual context,
where mails may contain discussion in different
languages, written with different tools, and
encoded using different standards. Hence we
patched an existing tool so that it archives all
mail in UTF-8, regardless of its original
encoding.
To avoid the considerable work of the webmaster
and to facilitate the communication and the
exchange of informations between the users of
the database, we are developing tools to facilitate
the use of a document repository.
After registration and login, users can easily
upload online a file in whatever format. It will
immediately be stored into the document
repository and made accessible online on the
web.

4 Actual Research and Development
Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998624">
The Papillon project is a extremely interesting
experimentation platform. We are currently
working on validation of monolingual data,
management of axies and acquisition of new
data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999662">
4.1 Validation of the Monolingual Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971384615385">
A team of trusted lexicographers validates user
contributions before they are integrated into the
main database.
This validation is a time consuming process and
implies a good level in linguistics and
lexicography. Moreover, we may not find enough
specialists volunteering for such a work and we
may have to pay a core team for this.
This task is essential and should be conducted as
quickly as possible lest the users will be
discouraged by the delays implied by the central
team.
Hence, even in this validation process, we wish to
enroll users as much as possible. For this task, we
plan to implement tools for indirect validation of
information using vote mechanisms and
generating questions answerable without any
special knowledge in linguistics.
As a first experiment, we will use a French
generator in order to produce a lot of examples
using the word to be validated and a set of known
words (already validated). These examples will
be presented to native speakers and they will
simply have to accept or reject them. This
strategy is very interesting in our context, as it
will help validating the lexical functions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996662">
4.2 Management of the Interlingual Links
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999928125">
The use of a pivot dictionary to represent
translation equivalence is challenging. This
macrostructure is very satisfying on a theoretical
level, but introduces a high complexity of
management.
In Sérasset (1994), we envisaged that these
interlingual acceptions would be created and
managed by hand by a team of specialists, helped
by tools that would detect inconsistencies and
propagate decisions among the different
languages. This appeared to be unrealistic.
However, we now have means to manage these
acceptions automatically. For this, we use the fact
that the interlingual acceptions volume does not,
in any way, represent a semantic pivot. It is not
related to an ontology.
In fact, the only relevant purpose of this
interlingual volume is to factorise the bilingual
links we find in classical bilingual dictionaries
(or the ones that will be specified by the users).
Hence, given a set of translation equivalences
between monolingual acceptions of different
languages, it is possible to compute a minimal set
of acceptions (and their links) that conforms to a
set of well-formedness criteria.
One of the difficult tasks is to obtain bilingual
translation equivalences between monolingual
acceptions when bilingual dictionaries often
provide bilingual links between mere lemmas.
For this, we will use aligned corpora and
translations memories to add contextual
information to the translation pairs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999657">
4.3 Acquisition of new data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978333333333">
To depend entirely on volunteer work is of course
unrealistic, especially while beginning to build
the lexical database. That is why we first reuse
existing dictionaries in order to build the kernelof
the database.
Contributors will come in later, filling in missing
informationin existing entries and creating partial
or complete new entries as well as links.
However, as we are using a rather complex
structure which require some skills that are not
shared by all Internet users, we will have to help
them help us.
In particular, we are beginning to use
corpus-based techniques to extract lemmas that
will be candidates as a value of a lexical function.
Determining the appropriate lexical function is
one of the jobs of our contributors, but they will
be helped in this task by tools that will provide
them with questions and candidate paraphrases.
For a complement of information or to help the
contributors in their task, the database should
also propose the consultation of other
dictionaries stored locally or available online on
the web.
Moreover, to be really useful for the reader, and
especially to the learners, the examples found in
the dictionaries will be translated in other
languages literally and semantically. Some of
these translations will be extracted from aligned
corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999971352941176">
The theoretical frameworks for the whole
database, the macrostructure and the
microstructure are very well defined. It
constitutes a solid basis for the implementation.
A lot of open problems still have to be addressed
for the Papillon project to be a success. In this
respect, the Papillon project appears to be a very
interesting experimentation platform for a lot of
NLP research as data acquisition or human access
to lexical data, among others.
All this research will improve the attraction of
such a project to the Internet users. This attraction
is necessary for the project to go on, as it is highly
dependent on its users motivations.
This way, we will be able to provide a very
interesting multilingual lexical database that we
hope useful for a lot of persons.

<abstract confidence="0.999434441860465">Many NLP systems are based on lexical data. The development costs of such data are a major drawback in such NLP systems. In order to cut these costs, we adopt a strategy inspired from &amp;quot;open-source&amp;quot; projects to allow volunteers to collaborate in the creation of a multilingual lexical database. For this, we had to specify and develop tools to manage a lexical database containing information complete and detailed enough to be usable for a wide range of applications. This paper presents our project and details the tools, frameworks and structures used to manage such a database. We will also show some research problems still to be addressed in this context. Résumé La connaissance linguistique reste une constituante importante de nombreux systèmes de traitement automatique des langues (TAL). Le coût de création d’un dictionnaire est l’un des freins majeurs dans le développement de ces systèmes. Afin de réduire les coûts de création de cette connaissance lexicale, nous adoptons une méthode inspirée des projets &amp;quot;open-source&amp;quot; afin de créer une base lexicale multilingue. Pour cela, nous avons spécifié et développé des outils de gestion d&apos;une base lexicale contenant des informations suffisamment complètes et détaillées pour êtres utilisées dans de nombreuses applications différentes. Cet article présente notre projet et détaille les outils, les cadres et les structures utilisées pour la gestion de cette base. Nous montrons aussi certains problèmes de recherche ouverts qu&apos;il nous faut aborder dans ce contexte.</abstract>

These examples will be presented to native speakers and they will simply have to accept or reject them. This strategy is very interesting in our context, as it will help validating the lexical functions. 4.2 Management of the Interlingual Links The use of a pivot dictionary to represent translation equivalence is challenging. This macrostructure is very satisfying on a theoretical level, but introduces a high complexity of management. In Sérasset (1994), we envisaged that these interlingual acceptions would be created and managed by hand by a team of specialists, helped by tools that would detect inconsistencies and propagate decisions among the different languages. This appeared to be unrealistic. However, we now have means to manage these acceptions automatically. For this, we use the fact that the interlingual acceptions volume does not, in any way, represent a semantic pivot. It is not related to an ontology. In fact, the only relevant purpose of this interlingual volume is to factorise the bilingual links we find in classical bilingual </context>
