Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9996012">
Previous research on temporal anchoring
and ordering has focused on the annota-
tion and learning of temporal relations
between events. These qualitative rela-
tions can be usefully supplemented with
information about metric constraints,
specifically as to how long events last.
This paper describes the first steps in ac-
quiring metric temporal constraints for
events. The work is carried out in the
context of the TimeML framework for
marking up events and their temporal re-
lations. This pilot study examines the fea-
sibility of acquisition of metric temporal
constraints from corpora.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999637434782609">
The growing interest in practical NLP applica-
tions such as question-answering and text sum-
marization places increasing demands on the
processing of temporal information. In multi-
document summarization of news articles, it can
be useful to know the relative order of events so
as to merge and present information from multi-
ple news sources correctly. In question-
answering, one would like to be able to ask when
an event occurs, or what events occurred prior to
a particular event. A wealth of prior research by
(Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang and
Schubert 1992), (Kamp and Reyle 1993), (Las-
carides and Asher 1993), (Hitzeman et al. 1995),
(Kehler 2000) and others, has explored the dif-
ferent knowledge sources used in inferring the
temporal ordering of events, including temporal
adverbials, tense, aspect, rhetorical relations,
pragmatic conventions, and background knowl-
edge. For example, the narrative convention of
events being described in the order in which they
occur is followed in (1), but overridden by means
of a discourse relation, Explanation in (2).

<bodyText confidence="0.947305055555556">
While there has been a spurt of recent research
addressing the event ordering problem, e.g.,
(Mani and Wilson 2000) (Filatova and Hovy
2001) (Schilder and Habel 2001) (Li et al. 2001)
(Mani et al. 2003) (Li et al. 2004) (Lapata and
Lascarides 2004) (Boguraev and Ando 2005)
(Mani et al. 2006), that research relies on qualita-
tive temporal relations. Qualitative relations (e.g.,
event A BEFORE event B, or event A DURING
time T) are certainly of interest in developing
timelines of events in news and other genres.
However, metric constraints can also be poten-
tially useful in this ordering problem. For exam-
ple, in (3), it can be crucial to know whether the
bomb landed a few minutes to hours or several
years BEFORE the hospitalization. While hu-
mans have strong intuitions about this from
commonsense knowledge, machines don’t.

specified.
These examples suggest that it may be possi-
ble to mine information from a corpus to fill in
extents for the time intervals of and between
events, when these are either unspecified or par-
tially specified. Metric constraints can also po-
tentially lead to better qualitative links, e.g.,
events with long durations are more likely to
overlap with other events.
This paper describes some preliminary ex-
periments to acquire metric constraints. The ap-
proach extends the TimeML representation
(Pustejovsky et al. 2005) to include such con-
straints. We first translate a TimeML representa-
tion with qualitative relations into one where
metric constraints are added. This representation
may tell us how long certain events last, and the
length of the gaps between them, given the in-
formation in the text. However, the information
in the text may be incomplete; some extents may
be unknown. We therefore need an external
source of knowledge regarding the typical ex-
tents of events, which we can use when the text
doesn’t provide it. We accordingly describe an
initial attempt to bootstrap event durations from
raw corpora as well as corpora annotated with
qualitative relations.

2 Annotation Scheme and Corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999531454545455">
TimeML (Pustejovsky et al. 2005)
(www.timeml.org) is an annotation scheme for
markup of events, times, and their qualitative
temporal relations in news articles. The TimeML
scheme flags tensed verbs, adjectives, and nomi-
nals with EVENT tags with various attributes,
including the class of event, tense, grammatical
aspect, polarity (negative or positive), any modal
operators which govern the event being tagged,
and cardinality of the event if it’s mentioned
more than once. Likewise, time expressions are
flagged and their values normalized, based on an
extension of the ACE (2004) (tern.mitre.org)
TIMEX2 annotation scheme (called TIMEX3).
For temporal relations, TimeML defines a
TLINK tag that links tagged events to other
events and/or times. For example, given sentence
(4), a TLINK tag will anchor the event instance
of announcing to the time expression Tuesday
(whose normalized value will be inferred from
context), with the relation IS_INCLUDED. This
is shown in (5).

<bodyText confidence="0.996995139534884">
The representation of time expressions in Ti-
meML uses TIMEX2, which is an extension of
the TIMEX2 scheme (Ferro et al. 2005). It repre-
sents three different kinds of time values: points
in time (answering the question “when?”), dura-
tions (answering “how long?”), and frequencies
(answering “how often?”)1.
TimeML uses 14 temporal relations in the
TLINK relTypes. Among these, the 6 inverse
relations are redundant. In order to have a non-
hierarchical classification, SIMULTANEOUS
and IDENTITY are collapsed, since IDENTITY
is a subtype of SIMULTANEOUS. (An event or
time is SIMULTANEOUS with another event or
time if they occupy the same time interval. X and
Y are IDENTICAL if they are simultaneous and
coreferential). DURING and IS_INCLUDED are
collapsed since DURING is a subtype of
IS_INCLUDED that anchors events to times that
are durations. (An event or time INCLUDES an-
other event or time if the latter occupies a proper
subinterval of the former.) IBEFORE (immedi-
ately before) corresponds to MEETS in Allen’s
interval calculus (Allen 1984). Allen’s OVER-
LAPS relation is not represented in TimeML.
The above considerations allow us to collapse
the TLINK relations to a disjunctive classifica-
tion of 6 temporal relations TRels = {SIMUL-
TANEOUS, IBEFORE, BEFORE, BEGINS,
ENDS, INCLUDES}. These 6 relations and their
inverses map one-to-one to 12 of Allen’s 13 ba-
sic relations (Allen 1984).
Formally, each TLINK is a constraint of the
general form x R y, where x and y are intervals,
and R is a disjunct ∨i=1,..,6(ri), where ri is a rela-
tion in TRels. In annotating a document for Ti-
1 Our representation (using t3 and t4) grounds the fuzzy
primitive P1Q3 (i.e., a period of one 3rd-quarter) to specific
months, though this is an application-specific step. In ana-
lyzing our data, we normalize P1Q3 as P3M (i.e., a period
of 3 months). For conciseness, we omit TimeML EVENT
and TIMEX3 attributes that aren’t relevant to the discus-
sion.

meML, the annotator adds a TLINK iff she can
commit to the TLINK relType being unambigu-
ous, i.e., having exactly one relType r.
Two human-annotated corpora have been re-
leased based on TimeML2: TimeBank 1.2 (Puste-
jovsky et al. 2003) with 186 documents and
64,077 words of text, and the Opinion Corpus
(www.timeml.org), with 73 documents and
38,709 words. TimeBank 1.2 (we use 1.2.a) was
created in the early stages of TimeML develop-
ment, and was partitioned across five annotators
with different levels of expertise. The Opinion
Corpus was developed recently, and was parti-
tioned across just two highly trained annotators,
and could therefore be expected to be less noisy.
In our experiments, we merged the two datasets
to produce a single corpus, called OTC.

3.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999709">
The first step is to translate a TimeML rep-
resentation with qualitative relations into one
where metric constraints are added. This transla-
tion needs to produce a consistent metric repre-
sentation. The temporal extents of events, and
between events, can be read off, when there are
no unknowns, from the metric representation.
The problem, however is that the representation
may have unknowns, and the extents may not be
minimal.

3.2 Mapping to Metric Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831888888889">
Let each event or time interval x be repre-
sented as a pair of start and end time points &lt;x1,
x2&gt;. For example, given sentence (4), and the
TimeML representation shown in (5), let x be
fall and y be announce. Then, we have x1 =
19970701T00, x2 = 19970930T23:59, y1 =
19980108Tn1, y2 = 19980108Tn2 (here T repre-
sents time of day in hours).
To add metric constraints, given a pair of
events or times x and y, where x=&lt;x1, x2&gt; and
y=&lt;y1, y2&gt;, we need to add, based on the quali-
tative relation between x and y, constraints of the
general form (xi-yj) &lt; n, for 1 &lt; i, j &lt;2. We fol-
low precisely the method ‘Allen-to-metric’ of
(Kautz and Ladkin 1991) which defines metric
constraints for each relation R in TRels. For ex-
ample, here is a qualitative relation and its metric
constraints:

In our example, where x is fall and y is the
announce, we are given the qualitative relation-
ship that x is BEFORE Y, so the metric con-
straint (x2-y1) &lt; 0 can be asserted.

metric constraint:

z=&lt;z1, z2&gt; be the time of Tuesday, where z1 =
19980108T00, and z2 = 19980108T23:59. Since
we are given the qualitative relation y
IS_INCLUDED z, the metric constraints (z1-y1)
&lt; 0 and (y2-z2) &lt; 0 can be asserted.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997277">
3.3 Consistency Checking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999073">
We now turn to the general problem of check-
ing consistency. The set of TLINKs for a docu-
ment constitutes a graph, where the nodes are
events or times, and the edges are TLINKs.
Given such a TimeML-derived graph for a
document, a temporal closure algorithm (Verha-
gen 2005) carries out a transitive closure of the
graph. The transitive closure algorithm was in-
spired by (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000) and is
based on Allen’s interval algebra, taking into
account the limitations on that algebra that were
pointed out by (Vilain et al. 1990). It is basically
a constraint propagation algorithm that uses a
transitivity table to model the compositional be-
havior of all pairs of relations in a document. The
algorithm’s transitivity table is represented by
745 axioms. An example axiom is shown in (8):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996847666666667">
(8) If relation(A, B) = BEFORE &amp;&amp;
relation(B, C) = INCLUDES
then infer relation(A, C) = BEFORE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892285714286">
In propagating constraints, links added by clo-
sure can have a disjunction of one or more rela-
tions in TRels. When the algorithm terminates,
any TLINK with more than one disjunct is dis-
carded. Thus, a closed graph is consistent and
has a single relType r in TRels for each TLINK
edge. The algorithm runs in O(n3) time, where n
is the number of intervals.
The closed graph is augmented so that when-
ever input edges a r1 b and b r2 c are composed to
yield the output edge a r3 c, where r1, r2, and r3
are in TRels, the metric constraints for r3 are
added to the output edge. To continue our exam-
ple, since the fall x is BEFORE the Tuesday z

These links were then corrected and validated by
hand and then added to the OTC data to form an
integrated corpus. An example from the BNC is
shown in (9).
and z INCLUDES y (announce), we can infer,
using rule 8, that x is BEFORE y, i.e., that fall
precedes announce. Using rule (6), we can again
assert that (x2-y1) &lt; 0.

We now have the metric constraints added to
the graph in a consistent manner. It remains to
compute, given each event or time x=&lt;x1, x2&gt;,
the values for x1 and x2. In our example, we
have fall x=&lt;19970701T00, 19970930T23:59&gt;,
announce y=&lt;19980108Tn1, 19980108Tn2&gt;,

19980108T23:59&gt;, and the added metric con-
straints that (x2-y1), (z1-y1), and (y2-z2) are all
negative. Graphically, this can be pictured as in
Figure 1.
As can be see in Figure 1, there are still un-
knowns (n1 and n2): we aren’t told exactly how
long announce lasted -- it could be anywhere up
to a day. We therefore need to acquire informa-
tion about how long events last when the exam-
ple text doesn’t tell us. We now turn to this prob-
lem.

We started with the 4593 event-time TLINKs
we found in the unclosed human-annotated OTC.
From these, we restricted ourselves to those
where the times involved were of type TIMEX3
DURATION. We augmented the TimeBank data
with information from the raw (un-annotated)
British National Corpus. We tried a variety of
search patterns to try and elicit durations, finally
converging on the single pattern “lasted”. There
were 1325 hits for this query in the BNC. (The
public web interface to the BNC only shows 50
random results at a time, so we had to iterate.)
The retrieved hits (sentences and fragments of
sentences) were then processed with components
from the TARSQI toolkit (Verhagen et al. 2005)
to provide automatic TimeML annotations. The

Next, the resulting data was subject to mor-
phological normalization in a semi-automated
fashion to generate more counts for each event.
Hyphens were removed, plurals were converted
to singular forms, finite verbs to infinitival forms,
and gerundive nominals to verbs. Derivational
ending on nominals were stripped and the corre-
sponding infinitival verb form generated. These
normalizations are rather aggressive and can lead
to loss of important distinctions. For example,
sets of events (e.g., storms or bombings) as a
whole can have much longer durations compared
to individual events. In addition, no word-sense
disambiguation was carried out, so different
senses of a given verb or event nominal may be
confounded together.

Interestingly, 67 events in the data correspond
to ‘achievement’ verbs, whose main characteris-
tic is that they can have a near-instantaneous du-
ration (though of course they can be iterated or
extended to have other durations). We obtained a
list of achievement verbs from the LCS lexicon
of (Dorr and Olsen 1997)3. Achievements can be
marked as having durations of PTXS, i.e., an
unspecified number of seconds. Such values
don’t reinforce any of the observed values, in-
stead extending the set of durations to include
much smaller durations. As a result, these hidden

6 Estimating Duration Probabilities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999650095238095">
Given a distribution of durations for events
observed in corpora, one of the challenges is to
arrive at an appropriate value for a given event
(or class of events). Based on data such as Table
2, we could estimate the probability P(lose, P3M)
≅ 0.346, while P(lose, P1D) ≅ 0.038, which is
nearly ten times less likely. Table 2 reveals peak-
ing at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, with
uniform probabilities for all others. Further, we
can estimate the probability that losses will be
during periods of 2 months, 3 months, or 9
months as ≅ 0.46. Of course, we would prefer a
much large sample to get more reliable estimates.
One could also infer a max-min time range,
but the maximum or minimum may not always
be likely, as in the case of lose, which has rela-
tively low probability of extending for “P1D” or
“P1E”. Turning to earnings, we find that P(earn,
P9M) ≅ 4/16 = 0.25, P(earn, P1Y) ≅ 0.31, but
P(earn, P3M) ≅ 0.43, since most earnings are
reported for a quarter.

RATION values, as in the examples of durations
in Table 2, or they could be aggregated in some
fashion, as in Table 3. In the discrete view,
unless we have a category of 4 months, the prob-
ability of a loss extending over 4 months is unde-
fined. Viewed this way, the problem is one of
classification, namely providing the probability
that an event has a particular duration category.
The second view takes duration to be continu-
ous, so the duration of an event can have any
subinterval as a value. The problem here is one
of regression. We can re-plot the data in Table 2
as Figure 2, where we have plotted durations in
days on the x-axis in a natural log scale, and fre-
quency on the y-axis. Since we have plotted the
durations as a curve, we can interpolate and ex-
trapolate durations, so that we can obtain the
probability of a loss for 4 months. Of course, we
would like to fit the best curve possible, and, as
always, the more data points we have, the better.

More durations can be inferred from the OTC
by coercing TIMEX3 DATE and TIME expres-
sions to DURATIONS; for example, if someone
announced something in 1997, the maximum
duration would be one year. Whether this leads
to reliable heuristics or not remains to be seen.

7.2 Event class aggregation

A more useful approach might be to aggregate
events into classes, as we have done implicitly
with financial events. Reporting verbs are al-
ready identified as a TimeML subclass, as are
aspectual verbs such as begin, continue and fin-
ish. Arriving at an appropriate set of classes,
based on distributional data or resource-derived
classes (e.g., TimeML, VerbNet, WordNet, etc.)
remains to be explored.

7.3 Expanding the corpus sample
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992125">
Last but not least, we could expand substan-
tially the search patterns and size of the corpus
searched against. In particular, we could emulate
the approach used in VerbOcean (Chklovski and
Pantel 2004). This resource consists of lexical
relations mined from Google searches. The min-
ing uses a set of lexical and syntactic patterns to
test for pairs of verbs strongly associated on the
Web in a particular semantic relation. For exam-
ple, the system discovers that marriage happens-
before divorce, and that tie happens-before untie.
Such results are based on estimating the prob-
ability of the joint occurrence of the two verbs
and the pattern. One can imagine a similar ap-
proach being used for durations. Bootstrapping
of patterns may also be possible.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920081081081">
This paper describes the first steps in acquir-
ing metric temporal constraints for events. The
work is carried out in the context of the TimeML
framework for marking up events and their tem-
poral relations. We have identified a method for
enhancing TimeML annotations with metric con-
straints. Although the temporal reasoning re-
quired to carry that out has been described in the
prior literature, e.g., (Kautz and Ladkin 1991),
this is a first attempt at lexical acquisition of
metrical constraints. As a pilot study, it does
suggest the feasibility of acquisition of metric
temporal constraints from corpora. In follow-on
research, we will explore the enhancements de-
scribed in Section 7.
However, this work is limited by the lack of
evaluation, in terms of assessing how valid the
durations inferred by our method are compared
with human annotations. In ongoing work, Jerry
Hobbs and his colleagues (Pan et al. 2006) have
developed an annotation scheme for humans to
mark up event durations in documents. Once
such enhancements are carried out, it will cer-
tainly be fruitful to compare the duration prob-
abilities obtained with the ranges of durations
provided in that corpus.
In future, we will explore both regression and
classification models for duration learning. In the
latter case, we will investigate the use of con-
structive induction e.g., (Bloedorn and Michalski
1998). In particular, we will avail of operators to
implement attribute abstraction that will cluster
durations into coarse-grained classes, based on
distributions of atomic durations observed in the
data. We will also investigate the extent to which
learned durations can be used to constrain
TLINK ordering.

To add metric constraints, given a pair of events or times x and y, where x=&lt;x1, x2&gt; and y=&lt;y1, y2&gt;, we need to add, based on the qualitative relation between x and y, constraints of the general form (xi-yj) &lt; n, for 1 &lt; i, j &lt;2.

For example, here is a qualitative relation and its metric constraints: (6) x is BEFORE y iff (x2-y1) &lt; 0. 2More details can be found at timeml.org. In our example, where x is fall and y is the announce, we are given the qualitative relationship that x is BEFORE Y, so the metric constraint (x2-y1) &lt; 0 can be asserted.

In annotating a document for Ti1 Our representation (using t3 and t4) grounds the fuzzy primitive P1Q3 (i.e., a period of one 3rd-quarter) to specific months, though this is an application-specific step. In analyzing our data, we normalize P1Q3 as P3M (i.e., a period of 3 months). For conciseness, we omit TimeML EVENT and TIMEX3 attributes that aren’t relevant to the discussion. 24 meML, the annotator adds a TLINK iff she can commit to the TLINK relType being unambiguous, i.e., having exactly one relType r. Two human-annotated corpora have been released based on TimeML2: TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al. 2003) with 186 documents and 64,077 words of text, and the Opinion Corpus (www.timeml.org), with 73 documents and 38,709 words. TimeBank 1.2 (we use 1.2.a) was created in the early stages of TimeML development, and was partitioned across five annotators with different levels of expertise. The Opinion Corpus was developed recently, and was partitioned across just two highly trained annotators, and could therefore be expected to be less noisy. In our experiments, we merged the two datasets to produce a single corpus, called OTC. 3 Translation 3.1 Introduction The first step is to translate a TimeML r</context>

Since we are given the qualitative relation y IS_INCLUDED z, the metric constraints (z1-y1) &lt; 0 and (y2-z2) &lt; 0 can be asserted. 3.3 Consistency Checking We now turn to the general problem of checking consistency. The set of TLINKs for a document constitutes a graph, where the nodes are events or times, and the edges are TLINKs. Given such a TimeML-derived graph for a document, a temporal closure algorithm (Verhagen 2005) carries out a transitive closure of the graph. The transitive closure algorithm was inspired by (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000) and is based on Allen’s interval algebra, taking into account the limitations on that algebra that were pointed out by (Vilain et al. 1990). It is basically a constraint propagation algorithm that uses a transitivity table to model the compositional behavior of all pairs of relations in a document. The algorithm’s transitivity table is represented by 745 axioms. An example axiom is shown in (8): (8) If relation(A, B) = BEFORE &amp;&amp; relation(B, C) = INCLUDES then infer relation(A, C) = BEFORE. In propagating constraints, links added by closure can have a disjunction of one or more relations in TR</context>

From these, we restricted ourselves to those where the times involved were of type TIMEX3 DURATION. We augmented the TimeBank data with information from the raw (un-annotated) British National Corpus. We tried a variety of search patterns to try and elicit durations, finally converging on the single pattern “lasted”. There were 1325 hits for this query in the BNC. (The public web interface to the BNC only shows 50 random results at a time, so we had to iterate.) The retrieved hits (sentences and fragments of sentences) were then processed with components from the TARSQI toolkit (Verhagen et al. 2005) to provide automatic TimeML annotations.

Next, the resulting data was subject to morphological normalization in a semi-automated fashion to generate more counts for each event. Hyphens were removed, plurals were converted to singular forms, finite verbs to infinitival forms, and gerundive nominals to verbs. Derivational ending on nominals were stripped and the corresponding infinitival verb form generated. These normalizations are rather aggressive and can lea</context>
