BioNLP 2010: Year in review

Interest continues to increase in Biomedical Natural Language Processing, evidenced by the number of
venues dedicated to BioNLP, the publication of a special issue of the Journal of Biomedical Informatics
on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (Chapman and Cohen 2009), and the new and ongoing
initiatives on BioNLP standards, centralized repositories, and community-wide evaluations. The latter
include the third BioCreAtIvE evaluation (since 2003) to determine the state of the art in biomedical text
mining and information extraction; the fourth i2b2 challenge on identifying concepts and relations in
clinical notes; the CALBC project that plans to annotate several hundred thousand MEDLINE abstracts
on immunology; the BioNLP 2009 shared tasks1 that attracted 42 teams (of which 24 submitted their final
results); workshops at ISMB, LREC, NAACL, and ACL; sessions at the AMIA summits and symposia;
and the fourth international symposium on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine (SMBM).
The developments in BioNLP parallel key developing areas in medical informatics, including
computerized clinical decision support, telemedicine, biosurveillance, personalized medicine,
comparative effectiveness studies, and global health, as well as the emergence of clinical informatics
as a branch of informatics. Personalized medicine has also been identified as key in translational and
bioinformatics research. Other key areas in bioinformatics were high-throughput studies, literature
mining, genetic privacy, environmental genetics, small molecules, pathways, and stem cell biology.
As in years past, authors have chosen the BioNLP workshop as a venue for presenting work that is
innovative, novel, and challenging from an NLP perspective. The workshop received 34 submissions,
of which nine were accepted as full papers and an additional twelve were accepted as posters. With
very few exceptions, the submissions were of exceptional quality and we sincerely regret having to reject
some of the good-quality work.
The themes in this years papers and posters cover complex NLP problems ranging from the foundations,
such as a new approach to dealing with arguments of nominalizations (Kilicoglu et al. 2010), to high-
level tasks, such as an approach to predicting breast cancer stage using social networking analysis (Jha
and Elhadad 2010). Those who were waiting for the word sense disambiguation efforts to bear fruit will
be glad to see the results of a graph-based WSD applied to concept-based summarization (Plaza et al.
2010). The growing maturity of the field continues to show in careful comparisons of available tools, for
example, comparing widely-used syntactic parsers (Miwa et al. 2010). We also see re-use and expansion
of the available collections, for example, the BioNLP 2009 event extraction collection (Vlachos 2010).
In addition to event extraction (Bj¨orne et al. 2010, Ohta et al. 2010) and advanced methods for entity
extraction (Liu et al. 2010), the program presents a method and tool for extraction of information about
the expression of genes and their anatomical locations (Gerner et al. 2010).
Completing the program is work on expanding the set of methods for identifying negation and
speculation, methods for detection of adverse reactions to drugs, corpus-based derivation of ontology
for consequences of gene mutations, annotation methods and other timely topics presented in the poster
session.

</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99242">
John Wilbur obtained a PhD in pure mathematics from the University of California at Davis and an MD
from Loma Linda University. He is a Senior Investigator in the Computational Biology Branch of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information which is located in the US National Library of Medicine.
He is a principal investigator leading a research group in the study and development of statistical text
processing algorithms. While at NCBI he has developed a number of algorithms that are used in the
PubMed search engine including those for finding related documents, performing fuzzy phrase matching,
and spell checking users queries.

Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907666666667">
Humans are much more accurate at text mining than machines. Presumably this is because humans are
more intelligent than machines. We argue that the way to narrow this gap is by more effective machine
learning. One obvious difference between humans and machines is the large amounts of training data
machines require for successful learning. We will discuss some novel ways of obtaining training data
for machine learning. We will also discuss why humans appear to be different in their requirements for
training data and what this may imply for the future of machine learning.

We are profoundly grateful to the authors who chose BioNLP from the smorgasbord of the enticing
venues available this year. The authors willingness to share their work through BioNLP consistently
makes the workshop noteworthy and stimulating. We are equally indebted to the program committee
members (listed elsewhere in this volume) who produced at least two thorough reviews per paper on
a tight review schedule and with an admirable level of insight. Finally, we acknowledge the gracious
sponsorship of the Computational Medicine Center and Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati
Childrens Hospital Medical Center.
