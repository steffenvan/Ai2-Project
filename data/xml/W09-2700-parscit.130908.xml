The introduction of reasoning capabilities in question-answering (QA) systems appeared in the late 70s.
A second generation of QA systems, aimed at being cooperative, emerged in the late 80s - early 90s.
In these systems, quite advanced reasoning models were developed on closed domains to go beyond
the production of direct responses to a query, in particular when the query has no response or when it
contains misconceptions. More recently, systems such as JAVELIN, Inference WEB or Cogex, operating
over open domains, gradually integrated inferential components, but not as advanced as those of the
90s. Performances of these systems in the recent TREC-QA tracks show that reasoning components
substantially improve the response relevance and accuracy. They can also potentially be much more
cooperative. However, there is still a long way before being able to produce accurate, cooperative and
robust QA systems, because of the very large complexity of natural systems and of the need to make
several communities work together on common grounds.
Recent foundational, methodological and technological developments in knowledge representation
(e.g. ontologies, knowledge bases incorporating various forms of incompleteness or uncertainty), in
advanced reasoning forms (e.g. data fusion-integration, argumentation, decision theory, fuzzy logic,
incomplete knowledge bases, etc.), in advanced language processing resources and techniques (for
question processing as well as for generating responses) including semantic role labelling and the
recognition and resolution of temporal and spatial expressions, and recent progress in HLT and formal
pragmatics (user models, intentions, etc.) make it possible to foresee the elaboration of much more
accurate, cooperative and robust systems dedicated to answering questions from multimedia supports or
from textual data, from e.g. online texts or web pages, operating either on open or closed domains. The
user interface aspects (input, output (e.g. SMS or advanced interfaces), on line help, dialogue, etc.) are
also crucial for the viability of such systems.
We thanks very much the Programme Committee for producing accurate reviews.
