Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999944913043478">
This research is aimed at understanding the
dynamics of collaborative multi-party dis-
course across multiple communication mo-
dalities. Before we can truly make significant
strides in devising collaborative communica-
tion systems, there is a need to understand
how typical users utilize computationally sup-
ported communications mechanisms such as
email, instant messaging, video conferencing,
chat rooms, etc., both singularly and in con-
junction with traditional means of communi-
cation such as face-to-face meetings,
telephone calls and postal mail. Attempting to
understand an individual’s communications
profile with access to only a single modality is
challenging at best and often futile. Here, we
discuss the development of RACE Ð Retro-
spective Analysis of Communications Events
Ð a test-bed prototype to investigate issues re-
lating to multi-modal multi-party discourse.
We also examine future avenues of research
for further enhancing our prototype and inves-
tigating this area.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999897">
Communication is the heart of what makes us so-
cial creatures. Today, we have a myriad of tech-
nologies that allow us to communicate in ways our
forefathers could never have imagined. Computa-
tionally supported modalities such as email and
instant messaging have had immeasurable effect on
the way we work, play and generally interact with

those in our lives. Being able to understand how
individuals communicate, the methods they use,
their personal preferences etc., and are all part of a
field called anthroposemiotics1. This field looks to
uncover the mystery behind how we communicate
with ourselves (intrapersonal communication),
with others (interpersonal communication), within
groups (group dynamics) and across cultures
(cross-cultural communication). While there is a
great deal of literature in these fields, there are few
operational applications that allow for true hands-
on investigation.
Perhaps nowhere is the application of this
field more important than in the field of intelli-
gence analysis. Intelligence analysts must make
sound judgments, coherently constructed from
scattered heterogeneous fragments of information
while being faced with significant time constraints.
The information they use is rarely complete, often
unreliable and usually temporally and spatially
diverse. These dimensions need to be aligned and
the information understood to enable the analyst to
recognize sequences of inter-related events and
hypothesize about future actions.
Our aim has been to aid the analyst by
researching, designing and implementing a test-bed
for the investigation of collaborative, multi-party
discourse. The focus is on reducing the complexity
of analyzing communications data through a triage
process; from a large corpus to a small handful of
relevant conversations to finally a highly detailed
view of one or two conversations, with incorpo-
rated socio-behavioral dimensions. Below we pre-
sent our design methodology and discuss the latest
version of the prototype.

The design methodology we used included a
review of the literature, followed by in-depth focus
group discussions with working analysts to deter-
mine requirements. Following the group session, a
participatory design process was used to gather
more information from our user group, leading to a
set of sketches that were used in the initial proto-
type implementation. From these an initial proto-
type was created. The test-bed is currently in its
second phase of implementation that includes the
integration of components developed under other
auspices into the RACE environment. These in-
clude indicators of affect and social roles. Finally,
we have built and collected a number of data
sources that we intend to use to evaluate the sys-
tem. We describe these stages in the following sec-
tions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.969474">
2.1 Prior Art
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978716049383">
This effort began with a thorough literature
review across the fields of ubiquitous computing,
visualization, multi-party discourse and communi-
cations theory. A number of research systems with
similarities to our goal were reviewed in order to
be able to understand the landscape and determine
where specific opportunities may lie. Here we dis-
cuss some of the systems (mainly research proto-
types) that are available for reviewing
communications data.
As both Internet communications and com-
plex graphics capabilities have become more per-
vasive in modern computing, there has been much
interest in visualizing conversations. Due to the
ease of data capture with computationally sup-
ported communications, such communication mo-
dalities as email, chat, and forum/newsgroup
threads appear to be the most researched. Several
systems have represented vast, multi-threaded
newsgroup or forum posts such as USENET.
‘Loom’ can represent the activity patterns of indi-
viduals relative to one another, helping to charac-
terize individuals’ participation and roles (Donath
et al, 1999). In another view, linked posts are
graphed to represent threads, characterizing the
newsgroup as a whole. ‘Discourse Diagrams’ de-
scribes newsgroups with semantic graphs of related
concepts, and also graphs people’s connectedness
to one another in social networks (Sack, 2000).
‘Conversation Thumbnails’ uses an over-
view/detail display to contextualize a user’s post in
the group as a whole while it is being composed
(Wattenberg and Millen, 2003). ‘PeopleGarden’
represents each individual participant as a compos-
ite of their history of posting. Having all partici-
pants represented in the same screen provides
insight into the dynamics of the group as a whole
across its recorded history, although there is no
way to track connections between individuals or
threading (Xiong and Donath, 1999).
In RACE, the topics of a multitude of con-
versations are explored by an analyst looking for
both episodic and social information. Through an
iterative filtering process, the analyst examines
individual conversations. Like the newsgroup visu-
alizations above, the goals are (in addition to a
general desire to understand what is going on) to
determine an individual’s social role and dynamic
of the group, but the concept of “conversations” is
more granular. Whereas the newsgroup visualiza-
tions may represent hundreds or even thousands of
users and conversation threads, the detailed visu-
alization in RACE’s final screen represents a sin-
gle discourse with as few as two people. Thus, the
systems above deal with a higher level of abstrac-
tion and do not convey information on “lurkers”
who may read but not post, emotional qualities of
contributions, or the temporal information present
in synchronous communication. RACE has the
additional goals of denoting presence, affect, and
what Viegas and Donath call “negotiation of con-
versational synchrony” (1999).
Research on chat room conversation has
produced some interesting visualizations that start
to deal with these concepts. The ‘Babble’ system
both facilitates and visualizes synchronous and
asynchronous chat (Erickson and Laff, 2001). Us-
ers are represented as colored dots on a social
proxy called a ‘cookie’. The more interactions they
have with the system, whether posting or only
reading, the more central they become in the visu-
alization. With inactivity, the dots move slowly
back out to the periphery of the cookie, conveying
information about presence and activity level.
‘Chat Circles’ is designed for synchronous chat
and creates a strong sense of location by situating
participants (represented as colored circles) in a
large 2D space and only allowing them to see the
text posted by others positioned nearby (Viegas
and Donath, 1999). The circles expand to encom-
pass posted text and shrink when ample time to
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999725">
read the utterance has passed. Even people who are
idling or only listening are represented spatially so
others can see them. People can position their cir-
cles to avoid the ‘noise’ of unrelated conversations
(as one could do at a cocktail party) or signify
whom they are addressing. Each post leaves a cu-
mulative translucent trace, indicating how long the
poster has been there and how active they have
been. Thus, group dynamics such as a group con-
versation fragmenting into smaller ones, relative
verbosity, and relative position are available for
interpretation.
While each of the systems above is designed
for a particular modality, RACE integrates email,
instant messaging, text messaging, phone conver-
sations and teleconferences, in-person meetings in
addition to chat or newsgroup participation. The
goal is to get a more holistic sense of an individual
throughout their discrete conversations and com-
munication methods. As a post-hoc analysis tool,
RACE aids the analyst by adding system interpre-
tations of affect and social dynamics to the infor-
mation represented in the prior art. It should be
noted that this effort violates one of Erickson’s six
claims about social visualization: “Portray actions,
not interpretation... users understand the context
better than the system ever will” (2003). We agree
in theory, but the needs of our analysts differ from
those of a contributor to the conversation. Content-
driven interpretations of group dynamics, affect,
and social role complement full-text transcripts of
the conversations, providing shortcuts to insight.
Below we discuss further the requirements of our
user group.
</bodyText>

2.2 Requirements Elicitation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999507904761905">
To ensure our research was applicable to our or-
ganization’s missions and fulfilled the require-
ments and expectations of our user group, we
enlisted the help of four analysts to determine spe-
cific requirements. These were to be our subject
matter experts (SME’s). Through interactions with
our SME’s we determined that while it is important
to being able to understand a single conversation in
time, it is just as, if not more, important to be able
to comprehend the stream of conversations that
occurs over longer periods, related to the same
topic. For example, it is important to be able to
intercept, process, and analyze a discussion be-
tween two individuals talking about making a
homemade bomb, but it is even more important to
place such a discussion within the context of the
set of communications leading to an understanding
of the overarching plot. Such review can provide
additional information that could be invaluable to
the analyst. Other requirements identified as part of
these sessions included:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.912064045454546">
• The system should allow the analyst to get
back to original source documents and be able
to review the provenance.
• The system should allow the analyst to anno-
tate the communication events.
• Consider the use of color for note taking and
marking modalities.
• The system should allow the analyst to high-
light conversation fragments (i.e., small parts
of a larger conversation that are considered
important).
• The system should provide basic translation
mechanisms for foreign language support as
well as provide some form of lexicon for terms
that fall outside an analyst’s field of expertise.
• The system should be able to import and ex-
port conversation fragments using common
formats. The system should allow multiple
analysts to work collaboratively within the
same workspace.
• The system should allow the analyst to cus-
tomize the environment to their preferences.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975428571429">
In addition to an informal list of requirements, a
great deal of brainstorming was performed during
this session. Following a participatory design proc-
ess, system designers worked with SME’s to put
together a work process and some initial sketches
of the overall system that could be fed into the im-
plementation stage.
The process was designed so that the analyst
could (Figure 1) interact with the conversation
corpus available to them (potentially produced as a
result of a search), viewing the conversations as
dots, clustered around major topics. This view
could be filtered based on time period, participants
involved and communications modality used.

<bodyText confidence="0.9972025">
On selecting a subset of conversations to
review further (Figure 2) the analyst moves
through to a second screen (the sequence view)
where they can analyze the conversations in rela-
tion to when they occurred (the view is reminiscent
of Microsoft Project’s Gant view).

While icons and text will continue to de-
pict the modality the conversation utilized, the fo-
cus at this level is of fusing the conversations to
build a sequenced stream of communications traf-
fic so the underlying thread or purpose can be un-
derstood. Finally (Figure 3), conversations of
specific interest to the analyst can be pursued in
further detail in a third screen, called the ‘detail
view’. Here, the full transcript is displayed and can
be ‘played’ utterance by utterance in real time. As
each utterance is reached, a text-to-speech engine
speaks the words, while a number of visual repre-
sentations indicate social constructs such as social
roles and the dynamics between the individuals.

2.3 Implemented Prototype

<bodyText confidence="0.998585428571429">
Using a participatory design process, in-
formed by the sketches and requirements of our
analysts and the limitations of current research sys-
tems, we implemented a three-screen prototype
analytical environment that allows a user to visual-
ize a large corpus of communications events
(Figure 4).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.993622">
Figure 4: Analyst using the RACE Environment.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924769230769">
The environment can run on three screens simulta-
neously, be split across three panes (useful for per-
forming analysis on large displays like wall-
mounted plasma displays) or on a single screen
with the use of a window manager seen in the top
right of each view.
For the ‘corpus view’ (left hand screen,
Figure 5) we customized some commercially
available visualization software to present the con-
versation corpus, clustered by topic. Zooming in to
individual items brings up metadata about that spe-
cific conversation. The different modalities may
also be represented by different icons or colors,

depending on the type of style sheet loaded. Filters
currently available include the modality used, the
participants involved and the time/date the conver-
sation occurred (and shortcuts to selecting all or
none, or the current inverse are also available).
Finally, a navigation window ensures the user does
not get lost when interacting with a massive data
that is topically diverse.

<bodyText confidence="0.998589086956522">
The ‘sequence view’ (Figure 6) is where
we envision the majority of an analyst’s time will
be spent. It is here that they will review, in detail, a
small subset of conversations that they found of
interest in the corpus space. For example, in their
exploration of the visualization, the analyst may
find a group of discussions about a particular
chemical substance. Knowing that this is relevant
to a study they are performing, they simply drag a
box around that subset and immediately those con-
versations are shown in the sequence view. Each
conversation has an independent time line and can
be zoomed out to show the entire conversation or
zoomed in to see the individual utterances (these
may also be accessed using tool-tips). The conver-
sation titles on the left hand side of the screen can
be unexpanded to show all the participants in-
volved. Clicking on the participant opens a dialog
box containing known information about that indi-
vidual (including any known aliases and other
names they may use online). A global timeline at
the bottom of the screen shows where each conver-
sation falls in sequence.

<bodyText confidence="0.999956083333333">
Once an important conversation is uncov-
ered through the triage process, it can be selected
for deeper investigation in the details view (Figure
7). This view can enable the analyst to see beyond
the individual utterances. Utilizing other research
performed at the Pacific Northwest National Labo-
ratory, the details view enables the analyst to gain
insight into an individual’s opinion on the topics
discussed. The transcript is color-coded to show
the seven dimensions of affect (expression, power,
ethics, attainment, skill, accomplishment and
transactions), while a graph representation allows
the analyst to compare individuals’ affect against
each other. In order to ingest the text in different
ways, a ‘text-to-speech’ engine can be used to have
the computer ‘speak’ the transcript. As it steps
through the utterances, a group dynamics graphic
(based on Erickson’s Social Proxy) shows how the
individuals relate to each other, highlighting those
involved in the conversation and those that are
idle. This view also provides a hierarchical view of
the topics discussed with the ability to trigger a
multi-dimensional visualization that maps partici-
pants to topics.

3 Evaluation and Data Sets
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993181818182">
In addition to the prototype system, an evalua-
tion plan was developed. The current dataset being
used to demonstrate the system was synthesized
from news reports about the London bombings of
7th July 2005. The evaluation will use a new
dataset build up from telephone transcripts from
the regional August 14, 2003 blackout2 to ensure
any analysts used that were involved in the devel-
opment of the prototype will not benefit from any
potential learning effects. This data is made up of
several participants involved in many different
conversations. These characteristics are exactly
what RACE was designed for. Another dataset is a
transcript of a murder mystery held on a chat room.
While there was only space for characters to inter-
act, there are many different threads of conversa-
tion going on at once. This data set will be useful
for exploring the social dynamic part of RACE.
We hope to show who the conversational “drivers”
were and explore what characteristics give some-
one away as hiding details they do not want other
characters to discover.

4 Summary &amp; Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998525">
The ultimate goal of the RACE project is to
assist analysts as they try to extract meaning from
a myriad of sources. To this end, we started by
talking with analysts themselves. This is in recog-
nition of the fact that no matter how powerful a
tool might seem to its developers, it is useless un-

less the end users actually adopt it. By working
with analysts every step of the way, we are keeping
that goal in sight.
RACE’s design as a test bed enables other re-
search to get in front of the analyst sooner. The
quick insertion of the text affect work illustrates
the capability to make functionality available to the
user for evaluation. Showing an analyst a concrete
example of an idea allows them to get a better un-
derstanding of it and an easier way to elicit feed-
back for future work.
While this is an exciting first step, there are
many avenues of crucial research still to be per-
formed. In many fields, having access to all the
communications events that occurred is rare. Re-
search needs to be performed to determine how
best to enable the analyst to fill in these blanks.
Potential approaches include hypothesized infer-
ence or the use placeholders.
Currently, the prototype analytical envi-
ronment only processes and displays textual tran-
scripts of communication events. This decision
was made to handle textual content first so to en-
sure proof of principle prior to expending effort on
the more challenging aspect of fusing video, audio,
still images and text (VAST). Some effort has been
expended on looking for suitable design metaphors
that could aid an analyst in making sense of such
diverse media (e.g., video production user inter-
faces such as Final Cut Pro) but more research,
design and evaluation is required.
More effort needs to be expended on un-
derstanding how best to fuse different modalities
of communication. Currently, a time-shifting ap-
proach is used to normalize an asynchronous email
thread with similar-topic synchronous communica-
tions (e.g., telephone call, instant messaging ses-
sion). This approach works but needs to be refined
in order to be successful. At one level, the modal-
ity used is irrelevant Ð it is the essence of the event
that is of primary concern. Being able to boil down
the associated threads into one specific stream
(e.g., multiple conversations across a number of
modalities, all around the topic of plotting to ex-
plode a device at a particular location) is crucial in
being able to support the analytical tradecraft and
allow analysts to provide actionable intelligence to
their superiors.
Conversations rarely keep to one single
focused topic, and this can cause problems in the
cluster visualization type approach used so far.

Topic segmentation is a difficult research area and
not one that we intend to pursue. There are at least
three projects currently on the way at our institu-
tion that deal with this area and this work intends
to utilize the fruits of those labors.
Finally, there are many elements of multi-
party discourse that exist outside linguistic bounda-
ries. The words we use, how often we make an
utterance, etc., all speak to who we are as individu-
als. While some of this is obvious and can be ob-
served with just a cursory review of a transcript of
the source material, other elements are discrete and
hidden. For example, conversational statistics can
be recorded and used to determine an individual’s
level of engagement in a topic. Detection of fa-
miliarity (e.g., either by specific words not cur-
rently found in the present conversation or through
the use of casual rather than formal speech) can
indicate personal relationships between individuals
in a dyad. Personality types can be inferred by
markers indicative of leadership (e.g., number of
interruptions performed/received, ability to change
topic, use of power terms) or weaker, subversive
roles (e.g., use of weak terms, submission of floor,
deference to others). Analysts are rarely able to
access such rich personality profiles of their sub-
jects without performing an exhaustive analysis or
calling in specialized help. While we are just be-
ginning to integrate certain elements of social dis-
course, there are many other dimensions to be
considered.

<abstract confidence="0.998491791666666">This research is aimed at understanding the dynamics of collaborative multi-party discourse across multiple communication modalities. Before we can truly make significant strides in devising collaborative communication systems, there is a need to understand how typical users utilize computationally supported communications mechanisms such as email, instant messaging, video conferencing, chat rooms, etc., both singularly and in conjunction with traditional means of communication such as face-to-face meetings, telephone calls and postal mail. Attempting to understand an individual’s communications profile with access to only a single modality is challenging at best and often futile. Here, we discuss the development of RACE Ð Retrospective Analysis of Communications Events Ð a test-bed prototype to investigate issues relating to multi-modal multi-party discourse. We also examine future avenues of research for further enhancing our prototype and investigating this area.</abstract>

Due to the ease of data capture with computationally supported communications, such communication modalities as email, chat, and forum/newsgroup threads appear to be the most researched. Several systems have represented vast, multi-threaded newsgroup or forum posts such as USENET. ‘Loom’ can represent the activity patterns of individuals relative to one another, helping to characterize individuals’ participation and roles (Donath et al, 1999). In another view, linked posts are graphed to represent threads, characterizing the newsgroup as a whole. ‘Discourse Diagrams’ describes newsgroups with semantic graphs of related concepts, and also graphs people’s connectedness to one another in social networks (Sack, 2000). ‘Conversation Thumbnails’ uses an overview/detail display to contextualize a user’s post in the group as a whole while it is being composed (Wattenberg and Millen, 2003). ‘PeopleGarden’ represents each individual participant as a composite of their history of posting.
