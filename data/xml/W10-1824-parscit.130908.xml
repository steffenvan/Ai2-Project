This paper presents preliminary work on a
corpus-based study of Korean demonstratives.
Through the development of an annotation
scheme and the use of spoken and written
corpora, we aim to determine different func-
tions of demonstratives and to examine their
distributional properties. Our corpus study
adopts similar features of annotation used in
Botley and McEnery (2001) and provides
some linguistic hypotheses on grammatical
functions of Korean demonstratives to be fur-
ther explored.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999962525423729">
Korean demonstratives are known to have two
different functions: anaphoric and deictic refer-
ence. Anaphoric demonstratives refer to objects,
individuals, events, situations, or propositions in
the given linguistic context. Deictic demonstra-
tives refer to physical objects, individuals, or
positions (or regions) in the given situational
context. Deictic variations commonly signal the
speaker’s physical distance from specified items.
Previous literature on Korean demonstratives has
focused on deictic functions in spoken Korean,
but a comprehensive approach to their diverse
linguistic functions is still lacking. This study
examines distinct usages of Korean demonstra-
tives in a spoken and a written corpus through
the annotation of relevant linguistic features. Our
annotation scheme and features are expected to
help clarify grammatical functions of Korean
demonstratives, as well as other anaphoric ex-
pressions.
English demonstratives show a binary distinc-
tion that depends on physical distance; there is a
distinction between proximal forms (this, these,
this N, these Ns) and distal forms (that, those,
that N, those Ns). In contrast, demonstratives in
languages like Korean and Japanese show a
three-way distinction: proximal forms, speaker-
centered distal forms, and speaker- and hearer-
centered distal forms. For example, deictic de-
monstrative i refers to a proximal object relative
to the speaker, ku refers to a distant object that is
close to the hearer, and ce refers to a distant ob-
ject that is far from both the speaker and the
hearer. Thus, distinct usage of ce and ku is asso-
ciated with how the speaker allocates the deictic
center and contextual space, i.e., the speaker-
centered space vs. the speaker- and the hearer–
centered space. In contrast with deictic usage,
previous studies (Chang, 1980; Chang, 1984)
assumed that anaphoric demonstratives show
only a two-way distinction between proximal
forms i and distal forms ku. However, it is still
controversial as to whether the boundaries be-
tween anaphora and deixis are clear cut. With
our annotation scheme, we aim to capture the
linguistic properties contributing to interpreta-
tions of demonstratives in Korean. In particular,
we aim to determine whether different registers
or genres contribute to different functions of de-
monstratives by comparing their usage in a spo-
ken corpus and a written corpus.
In consideration of a future comparative anal-
ysis with English demonstratives, we have de-
signed our annotation scheme by adopting Botley
and McEnery’s (2001) paradigmatic set of dis-
tinctive features for English demonstratives.
However, the detailed annotation features have
been revised according to language specific fea-
tures of Korean.

proximately 5000 eojeol. The subcorpora of the
spoken corpus are everyday conversations with-

Compared to English, Korean demonstratives
include more complex grammatical categories
with morphological relations. The demonstrative
forms i, ku, and ce combine with other words or
morphemes and form complex words including
nominals (e.g., i-kes: this+thing ‘this’), adverbs
(e.g., ce-lehkey: that+way ‘that way’), adjectives
(e.g., ku-lehata: it+is ‘is so’) and other lexical
categories. Thus, it is difficult to determine if
they all belong to the same category of demon-
stratives in Korean. In this study, demonstratives
are restricted to words that contain i, ku, and ce
maintaining a distinct referentialfunction of
pointing. The selected demonstratives include
adnouns ( i N ‘this N’, ku N ‘that N’, ce ‘that
N’), pronouns ( i-es/i-ke ‘this’, ku-kes/ ku-ke ‘it’,
ce-kes/ceke ‘that’, i-tul ‘these’, ku-tul ‘they’ ce-
tul), and locative pronouns ( yeki ‘here’, keki
‘there’, ceki ‘over there’). Although those forms
have different lexical categories, strong similari-
ties exist within the same morphological families,
which we will refer to as i type, ku type, and ce
type demonstratives. Our annotation work aims
to extract a generalization of the fundamental
usage of the three different types and to use that
generalization for developing further research on
various morphological variants containing i, ku,
and ce.

2.1 The Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998154797101449">
In order to mark referential functions of Korean
demonstratives, we first adopt Halliday and Ha-
san’s (1976) classification of the different refer-
ence functions of demonstratives: exophoric vs.
endophoric usage. We further divide exophora
into deixis and background. While the former
refers to a physical object or an individual (or
location) in the situational context, the latter re-
fers to certain shared information between the
speaker and the hearer.
deictic background anaphoric cataphoric
(shared knowledge)
Six distinct features include “Lexical Category of
a Demonstrative”, “Endophoricity”, “Exopho-
ricity”, “Syntactic Category of an Antecedent”,
“Phoric Type”, and “Semantic Function of an
Antecedent”. The first five features are adopted
from five features in Botley and McEnery’s
(2001) annotation work on English demonstra-
tives.2 The last feature (semantic function) has
been added for future work annotating semantic
information that facilitates anaphor resolution
processes.
Lexical categories of Korean demonstratives
in this study include four parts of speech: adnoun,
pronoun, locative pronoun (functioning also as
an adverb), and exclamatory expressions. While
the first three categories show referential func-
tions, the exclamatory expressions do not have
reference. Instead, they are used as expressions
conveying the speaker’s emotion or state, e.g.,
embarrassment, confusion, hedging. We do not,
however, exclude the possibility of linguistic
connectivity between demonstrative and excla-
matory forms. For instance, the distal demonstra-
tive form ce tends to be used as a hedging ex-
pression in Korean. Our study includes exclama-
tory usage as an annotation feature.
Endophoricity refers to two different func-
tions: anaphoric vs. cataphoric. Exophoricity re-
fers to context based vs. deixis. According to
Halliday and Hasan’s classification in (1), de-
monstratives with referential function show two
major usages: endophoric and exophoric. The
first type takes its antecedent within the given
text; the latter, within the given situation. Dis-
tinction between an anaphor and a cataphor de-
pends on the position of the antecedent. When an
endophor follows its antecedent, it is an anaphor;
the other case is a cataphor. Demonstratives may
have different types of antecedents syntactically.
The corresponding values include nominals (in-
cluding N or NP), clausals (including V, A, VP,
2 As one of the reviewers pointed out, our study has some
limitations as it only refers to two previous studies, Halliday
and Hasan (1976) and Botley and McEnery (2001). Al-
though we are aware of the other fundamental work includ-
ing demonstratives in a broader range of referential expres-
sions such as Gundel et al. (1993), Prince (1981), Nissim et
al. (2004), etc., we choose to focus on Korean demonstra-
tives because their exact grammatical functions have not
been comprehensively studied in existing literature. In addi-
tion, developing a broader classification system for referen-
tial expressions in Korean is a challenging task from both
theoretical and empirical perspectives; linguistic analyses of
Korean nominal expressions must deal with controversial
issues such as definiteness without articles, zero elements
functioning as anaphors, unsystematic morphological mark-
ing of plurality and genericity, etc.

AP, etc.), and sentential elements (S or Ss for
more than two sentences).3
The feature semantic function of an antece-
dent includes values of nominal entities, events,
and propositions. This feature will be expanded
into specified values such as event, process, state,
and circumstances in our future study. Phoric
type has been adopted from Botley and McEnery
(2001) and refers to two distinct relations: refer-
ence and substitution. According to Halliday and
Hasan, substitution is a relation between linguis-
tic forms, whereas reference is a relation between
meanings. The values of phoric type also include
non-phoric such as exophora whose antecedents
exist outside the text.

3 Although the syntactic category of an antecedent can be
differentiated in a more sophisticated way using phrasal
categories such as NP, VP, AdvP, etc. (as well as lexical
categories), this will render the annotation process nearly
impossible unless one uses a corpus with syntactic annota-
tion, such as treebanks. Thus, we use simplified syntactic
information such as nominal, clausal, and sentential.
4 The agreement rate was calculated for each six high level
categories separately and then averaged. The syntactic func-
tion has the lowest agreement rate even after the discussion
(K=0.76). This is due to complex properties of Korean de-
monstratives with unclear boundaries between exclamatory
expressions and other lexical categories.

pus. This fact is associated with the linguistic
function of ku that represents a speaker’s desire
to anchor interpersonal involvement with the
hearer by actively inviting the hearer’s voluntary
understanding of the target referent. In contrast, i
demonstratives imply that the speaker (writer)
intends to incorporate the hearer (reader) within
the proximal cognitive distance. In terms of an-
notation features, our findings are summarized as
follows.
Lexical category: In both the written and
spoken corpora, adnominal demonstratives are
more frequently used than pronouns or locative
pronouns. Demonstrative forms used as intensifi-
ers, hedges, or personal habitual noise have been
marked as exclamatives. Annotators have found
that it is often difficult to clearly distinguish
them from adnominal demonstratives.
Endophoricity: Our written corpus does not
include any cataphors, whereas the spoken cor-
pus shows 61 cases (cf. 523 anaphors). This fact
seems to be related to the speaker’s discourse
strategy of intending to call the discourse partici-
pants’ attention by placing an endophoric ele-
ment before its antecedent.
Exophoricity: Exophoric usage of demonstr-
atives in the written corpus is very limited. Only
17 cases were found (6 deixis vs. 11 context-
based). In the spoken corpus, exophoric usages
occur more frequently across three types of de-
monstratives. The deictic usage dominates the
context-based usage (151 deixis vs. 79 context-
based). As noted in previous literature, ce de-
monstratives mainly appear in deictic context,
where its antecedent is visible or exists in the
given situation. There seems to be a constraint of
deictic usage of ce involving physical existence
or visibility (or cognitive awareness) of an entity
in addition to distance. This hypothesis needs to
be further investigated with additional data.
Syntactic and Semantic Function: All three
types of i, ku, and ce demonstratives refer to no-
minal entities as their antecedents. Although i
and ku demonstratives are also used to refer to
clausals and sentential elements, only a few ex-
amples of ce replace clausal or sentential ele-
ments. Another notable point is that i and ku de-
monstratives refer to clausal or sentential ele-
ments (corresponding to events or propositions)
more frequently than nominal entities in both
spoken and written corpora. 59% of the antece-
dents of i demonstratives (56% for ku type) in
the written corpus are clausals or sentential ele-
ments, whereas 53% of the antecedents of i type
(69% for ku type) are in the spoken corpus. This
result needs to be tested on a larger corpus in our
future study.
Phoric Type: In our annotated corpus, we
only found referential examples, not substitu-
tional cases. Exophoric examples are marked as
non-phoric. In the written corpus, referential de-
monstratives are predominant (285 cases) and a
small number of non-phoric cases are observed
(18 cases). In the spoken corpus, referential de-
monstratives are more frequent (590 cases), whe-
reas non-phoric cases have been more observed
than in the written corpus (198 cases).

3 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605333333333">
In this paper we presented a corpus-based study
on Korean demonstratives. Six annotation fea-
tures were used to mark complex linguistic func-
tions of demonstratives. Using spoken and writ-
ten corpora, we compared different usages of
Korean demonstratives and showed that their
usages are different depending on the registers of
spoken and written Korean.
In spite of the deictic functions of demonstra-
tives highlighted in previous research, our study
indicates that endophoric usage is more predo-
minant. This hypothesis, as well as others in this
study, will be tested with a large corpus in our
future work. We also plan to incorporate more
sophisticated exploitation on semantic types of
antecedents. This information will be useful for
resolving the meaning of anaphoric demonstra-
tives.
