Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999330666666667">
This document describes the development of a
surface realisation component for the Portu-
guese language that takes advantage of the
data and evaluation tools provided by the
REG-2008 team. At this initial stage, our
work uses simple n-gram statistics to produce
descriptions in the Furniture domain, with lit-
tle or no linguistic variation. Preliminary re-
sults suggest that, unlike the generation of
English descriptions, contextual information
may be required to account for Portuguese
word order.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919363636364">
In this work we describe a surface realisation com-
ponent for Portuguese definite descriptions using
the data and evaluation tool provided as part of the
REG-2008 Challenge. However, given the differ-
ences between language and a number of project
decisions discussed below, the present results are
not suitable for comparison with the work done by
the actual task participants, and it should be re-
garded simply as an ongoing effort to generate and
evaluate Portuguese descriptions using similar
standards.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979433333333">
Our work is a simple application of n-gram statis-
tics to surface realisation. Two independent anno-
tators started by producing individual lists of the
most likely phrases that could possibly be associ-
ated with every attribute–value pair in the corpus.
Since at this initial stage we are only considering
1-to-n relations (i.e., each phrase is the realisation
of exactly one attribute-value pair) the mapping
annotation was straightforward. More complex (m-
to-n) cases – those in which two or more properties
may combine to form a single text unit (e.g., the
properties of being human, young and male may be
realised simply as “a young man” or even as “a
boy”) – will be discussed elsewhere.
Given a TUNA attribute set as an input, we
compute all (unordered) sets of phrases that corre-
spond to a possible description, including gender
variations. Next, we compute all possible permuta-
tions of each phrase set that matched a pre-defined
description template suitable to Portuguese phrase
order, once again with gender variation. As a re-
sult, even a simple attribute set as in “the large red
table” would have at least eight possible realisa-
tions in Portuguese, although only a few can be
considered well-formed and likely to be uttered for
the purpose of identification. The final task of se-
lecting the most likely output string is left to a
simple bigram language model built from a 40-
million words corpus of Brazilian Portuguese
newspaper articles.

3 Preliminary Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935857142857">
We produced a surface realisation form for each of
the 80 instances of Portuguese descriptions in the
REG-2008 development data. Overall, 32 instances
(40%) of descriptions were incorrectly generated.
The major source of errors was the lack of com-
plete gender agreement, since our simple bigram-
based model cannot handle long-distance depend-

<bodyText confidence="0.99931151923077">
encies appropriately, as in “o sofá grande ver-
melha”, in which the gender agreement between
“sofá” (masculine) and “vermelha” (feminine)
could not be established. We believe that this could
be easily fixed had we used a more expressive lan-
guage model instead.
Two independent annotators built a Portuguese
reference set by manually translating each of the
80 descriptions in the development data set and
taking into account the possible phrase realisations
defined earlier. More specifically, we produced a
‘normalized’ reference set, removing much of the
noise that naturally occurs in the raw data. This
included a number of likely errors (e.g., “red chair
in center red”), meta-attributes (e.g., “first picture
on third row”), illegal attributes (e.g.., “the grey
desk with drawers”), differences in specificity
(e.g., “shown from the side” as a less specific al-
ternative to both “facing left” and “facing right”
values) and synonymy (e.g., “facing the viewer” as
an alternative to “facing forward”). Moreover,
given that definiteness cannot be worked out from
the attribute set alone, all indefinite descriptions
were changed to definite.
Regarding the usefulness of this modified refer-
ence set, there are a number of due observations:
firstly, given the differences between languages,
our reference data set is not to be regarded as a
resource for investigating language use as the
original TUNA data set is intended to be, but rather
as a standard of acceptable performance for a prac-
tical Portuguese NLG system. Moreover, since the
translated descriptions were not produced in real
situations of reference, we are aware that our re-
sults are not directly comparable to, e.g., the work
carried out in the REG-2008 challenge for evaluat-
ing English descriptions, and that would remain the
case even without normalization.
On the other hand, although the result of both
translation and normalization tasks is a somewhat
simplified set of Portuguese descriptions, this is
not to say that these descriptions are tailored to
match those that we intend to generate. In fact, one
of the goals in the normalization task was to retain
the most appropriate instances of reference, which
included a large number of cases that we are not
presently able to produce, e.g., those combining
the x-dimension and y-dimension attributes in sin-
gle references to corners, as in “in the upper right
corner”. Figure 1 summarizes our findings for the
80 instances of descriptions in the Furniture do-
main.

4 Final Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999431">
One striking difference between system descrip-
tions and the reference set was the word order of
Portuguese adjectives. To our surprise, it is not
clear in which order attributes such as colour and
size should be combined in Portuguese definite
descriptions. For example, “a large red table”
could be realised either as type + colour + size
(e.g., “a mesa vermelha, grande” ) or as type + size
+ colour (e.g., “a mesa grande, vermelha”). As
both alternatives seem equally acceptable, the
choice may depend on which property contrasts
each of the distractors in the situation of reference.
Whilst the present ambiguity reveals a weakness in
our artificially-built reference set, it may also sug-
gest that a much more sophisticated approach to
Portuguese realisation is called-for, especially if
compared to the generation of English descriptions
whose word order seems fairly standard. We be-
lieve that further investigation on this issue is still
required
