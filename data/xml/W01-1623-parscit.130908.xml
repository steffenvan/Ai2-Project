Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999930235294118">
Large speech corpora have become indispensable
for current linguistic research and information
science applications dealing with spoken data
(Gibbon et al. 1997). Concretely, they provide
real phonetic data and empirical data-driven
knowledge on linguistic features of spoken
language. The corpus presented here is composed
of conversational dialogues. Conversations
contain a considerable variety of linguistic
phenomena as well as phonetic-acoustic
variations. Furthermore, they open up a wide
range of research issues such as dialogue acts,
turn-taking, lexical use of spoken language and
prosodic use in conversation. From a diachronic
point of view, such a large dialogue corpus
archives the contemporary daily conversational
use of a given language.

1 General Issues on Mandarin Dialogues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999384">
In the following, issues on Mandarin dialogues
relevant to spontaneous dialogue annotation are
summarized and discussed. It includes lexical
distribution, discourse markers, turn-taking and
prosodic characterization.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.673219">
1.1 Lexical Distribution in Spoken Mandarin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998111055555556">
Results presented by Tseng (2001) show that
speakers of Mandarin adopt some 30 words for
building core structures of utterances in
conversation, independently of individual
speakers. All subjects used these words more
than three times. The occurrences of these 30
core words make up about 80% of the overall
tokens in conversation. Interestingly but also
expected in conversational dialogues, the
distribution of token frequency across all subjects
is highly symmetric (Tseng 2001). For instance,
verbs “is located”, “is”, “that is”, “say”, “want”
and “have” were frequently used, so were
pronouns “s/he”, “you” and “I”. The negation
“don’t have” was a high-frequency word, so were
words “right”, “this/these” and ”that/those”.
Grammatical particles as well as discourse
particles were also among the core words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.936611">
1.2 Discourse Markers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999441621621622">
It is now well known that what differentiates
written texts from spontaneous speech most is the
use of discourse particles. Among the core words,
eleven words were discourse particles, or they
were used as discourse markers. In the literature,
there is still no consistent definition for discourse
markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993).
Discourse markers can be defined as follows:
elements whose original semantic meaning tends
to decrease and their use in spoken discourse
becomes more pragmatic and indicative of
discourse structuring are discourse markers. In
addition to several adverbs and determiners,
discourse particles can also be categorized as
discourse markers. They are very often observed
in Mandarin spoken conversations as mentioned
in Tseng (2001) and Clancy et al. (1996).
In Tseng (2001), each subject used on average
1.6 discourse particles per turn. This result leads
to the consideration, if there is a need to add
special categories for discourse particles or
particle-like words for spoken Mandarin.
Discourse particles were found to have different
and specific discourse use in conversation.
Namely, there exist discourse particles appearing
preferably in turn-beginning position and some
other discourse particles may exclusively mark
the location of repairs. Regarding the small size
of data used in Tseng (2001), it is one of the
reasons why the ongoing project is necessary for
research of Mandarin spontaneous conversations.
1989, Sagerer et al. 1994), subjects participating
in this project were told to converse as naturally
as possible. The scenario is similar to a situation
where two strangers meet at the first time, try to
find common topics interested by both of them
and have a chat.

1.3 Taking Turns in Dialogues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946714285714">
In spontaneous conversation, turn-taking usually
takes place arbitrarily to the extent that every
individual interacts differently with the others
under different circumstances. Thus, how to
annotate overlapping sequences is one of the
essential tasks in developing annotation systems.
In Mandarin conversation, there are words
preferably used in turn-initial position (Tseng
2001, Chui 2000). They normally have their own
discourse-related pragmatic function associated
with their positioning in utterances. Similarly,
how to mark up turn-initial positions is also
directly connected with the annotation
convention.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.94822">
1.4 Prosody in Spoken Mandarin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999782">
Lexical tones are typically characteristic of
spoken Mandarin. The interaction of lexical tones
and the other prosodic means such as stress and
intonation are related to a number of research
issues, particularly in conversation. Falling tones
may not show falling tendency anymore, when
the associated words are used for specific
discourse functions such as for indicating
hesitation or the beginning of a turn (Tseng
2001).

2 Mandarin Conversational Dialogue Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999050333333333">
This section deals with the design and collection
of a large Mandarin dialogue corpus currently
produced in Academia Sinica.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990219">
2.1 Design and Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999587555555556">
The long-term goal of this project is to collect
domain-independent Mandarin spoken dialogues.
They are daily conversations with specific topics
given for each stage of recording. Since the
design of scenario aims to collect natural and
spontaneous conversations, limitations on the
topics are reduced to a minimum. Different from
task-oriented dialogues such as air-planning or
instruction-construction tasks (Kowtko and Price
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.99582675">

topic 3
topic 5 topic 4

WHERE-HOW
WHAT-WHY
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.980588782608696">
As illustrated in Figure 1, this stage of corpus
collection consists of WHAT-WHERE
component. The subjects have to determine on
WHAT topic they’d like to talk. Usually, they do
not stick to only one topic. Sometime in
conversation, the participants asked each other
WHERE the events mentioned in their
conversation happened or WHERE they could
take part in the events. There are two reasons for
this design. First, we will extend the local
domains to WHAT-WHEN, WHAT-WHO,
WHERE-HOW as well as WHAT-WHY
combinations in the next five years to cover
important dialogue components used for daily
talks in Taiwan. This aims to archive the use of
contemporary spoken Mandarin from varied
daily-life perspectives. Second, casual
conversations usually do not require correctness
of information. To make sure that we will obtain
at least some “seriously spoken” materials, the
subjects should interact with attention to fulfil the
WHERE task, namely the route-asking and
route-describing task.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.95288">
2.2 Subjects and Instructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858625">
60, 23 male and 37 female, Taipei residents of
Taipei City who volunteered to participate in the
project were recorded in pairs. Age ranges from
16 to 45. Subjects did not know each other and
their task was to introduce themselves first. Then
they chose topics from those given on the
instruction sheet or they were also free of
choosing any other not-listed topics to talk about.
In addition, they asked some questions about
routes within conversation. The topics given to
the subjects are family, work, shopping, food,
travelling, politics and economics. Both subjects
can be information-acquirer or information-giver.
However, they were told that the person who
asked route questions had to make sure that s/he
has completely understood the described routes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999923">
2.3 Recording
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953636363636">
The dialogues were recorded by a SONY
TCD-D10 Pro II DAT tape recorder with
Audio-Technica ATM-33a handheld/stand
cardioid condenser microphones at a sampling
rate of 48 kHz. Each subject was recorded on a
separate channel on a DAT tape. There was no
time constraint given in advance. Once the
subjects completed their task and wished to end
the conversation, the recording was stopped.
Total length of corpus is about 25 hours
recording.

3 An Extensible Transcription Tool
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996929">
3.1 Functional Considerations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987529411765">
This section discusses three principles for
constructing word-based database for Mandarin
dialogues from audio data to lexical database.
Three functions have to be included in a
transcription system, either directly or potentially:
1) connecting the tasks of transcribing,
annotating and labelling of sound data, 2) being
able to deal with overlapping turns and 3) making
available possible tiers for later time-alignment.
There are three working levels for processing
spoken data: transcribe, annotate and label. First,
transcription is the transliteration of audio data.
Normally, it is verbatim transcription in plain text
form. A transcription tool has exclusively been
developed for broadcast spoken data, named
Transcriber (Barras et al. 2001). Audio data can
be nicely combined with the other information.
However, it lacks flexible possibility for defining
new annotation tags. It is especially difficult to
use Transcriber to transcribe Mandarin
conversations because of the written system of
Mandarin. For the understanding of content and
for the completeness of written system, Chinese
characters are as representative and important as
Latin transcriptions.
Secondly, to annotate spoken data is to add
linguistic explanations to the plain transcript to
represent linguistic structures at selected levels.
And lastly, to label sound data is to temporally
align transcript texts with speech signals. The
tool we develop for our corpus collection aims to
transcribe and annotate the speech data as well as
to build potential temporal tiers for future
labelling work. Traditional annotations of spoken
data orient at turn-structured separation of
utterances or sets of utterances (Sagerer et al.
1994). This leads to the following
inconveniences. The beginning and ending
boundaries between utterances are not
represented, because it is presupposed that the
current ending boundary is the beginning
boundary of the next unit. While doing temporal
alignment, pauses between utterance units and
speakers may be missing. From the point of view
of searching mechanism, an annotation system
should also satisfy the demand on classifying
sequences produced by given speakers or
sequences produced in a given time period. Thus,
it will be statistically effective and useful to
output annotated transcription data in a database
format.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999858">
3.2 TransList
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995359">
Recorded dialogues are currently being
transcribed by using a computer-aided program
TransList, specifically developed for transcribing
Mandarin conversations. The interface is
illustrated in Figure 2. Input contents include
location of sound file, subject, start and end times
of the transcribed segment in the correspondent
sound file, the person who transcribes the
segment. The actual transcription is done twofold:
in characters and in Pinyin.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.994012">
Figure 2: TransList
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.981517444444445">
Tag list can be flexibly extended to annotate
different phenomena any time while doing the
transcription. Each transcribed segment is
referred to its original sound file. However, a
direct connection to processing audio files is not
available yet. Regarding the output format of
TransList, two variations are currently in use.
One is conversation-typed format. In other words,
all sound files split from one conversation form
an independent text file. In order of time and
subject, the program outputs a turn-oriented
format, as illustrated in the next section. More
important is the second output format. All
transcribed segments belonging to one
conversation will be listed in a database, having
the following columns: characters, pinyin, sound
file and all added tags. Words marked up by
different tags will all have the values of added
tags as their attribute in the database. By doing
this, we plan to do word segmentation and
tagging for spoken Mandarin. An automatic word
segmentation and tagging system is currently
available for written Mandarin (Chen et al. 1996).
We intend to test this program for spontaneous
Mandarin. By outputting the transcription in
database format, we will make the continuing
data processing and searching more effective.

3.3 An Output Example

<bodyText confidence="0.857556071428571">
This section gives an example produced by
TransList.

yeshi dao gongguan huan danshuixian ranhou ni zhiyao zuo
dao dagai yuanshanzhan1&lt;/A 2 22230&gt;
In the above example, the brackets &lt;&gt; and &lt;/&gt;
mark up the beginning and ending boundaries of
a speaker production sequence. A and B stand for
speakers. Turns are not explicitly separated, but
marked up in the annotation. Numbers after the
speaker abbreviations indicate numbers of
production sequences by the speaker. Thus,
whether it is a turn-taking or it is a overlapping
can be evaluated by means of the third parameter
time (msec). With respect to tags added into the
transcribed segments, it is optional to include or
1 &lt;A 1 6473&gt; from city want go city gallery in the case we

to exclude the annotation tags. As shown in
Figure 2, these can be non-speech sounds, repairs
or discourse markers (Heeman and Allen 1999).

Regarding the small size of data used in Tseng (2001), it is one of the reasons why the ongoing project is necessary for research of Mandarin spontaneous conversations. 1989, Sagerer et al. 1994), subjects participating in this project were told to converse as naturally as possible. The scenario is similar to a situation where two strangers meet at the first time, try to find common topics interested by both of them and have a chat.

Secondly, to annotate spoken data is to add linguistic explanations to the plain transcript to represent linguistic structures at selected levels. And lastly, to label sound data is to temporally align transcript texts with speech signals. The tool we develop for our corpus collection aims to transcribe and annotate the speech data as well as to build potential temporal tiers for future labelling work. Traditional annotations of spoken data orient at turn-structured separation of utterances or sets of utterances (Sagerer et al. 1994). This leads to the following inconveniences. The beginning and ending boundaries between utterances are not represented, because it is presupposed that the current ending boundary is the beginning boundary of the next unit. While doing temporal alignment, pauses between utterance units and speakers may be missing. From the point of view of searching mechanism, an annotation system should also satisfy the demand on classifying sequences produced by given speakers or sequences produced in a given time period. Thus, it will be statistically effective and useful to output annotated transcription </context>

From a diachronic point of view, such a large dialogue corpus archives the contemporary daily conversational use of a given language. 1 General Issues on Mandarin Dialogues In the following, issues on Mandarin dialogues relevant to spontaneous dialogue annotation are summarized and discussed. It includes lexical distribution, discourse markers, turn-taking and prosodic characterization. 1.1 Lexical Distribution in Spoken Mandarin Results presented by Tseng (2001) show that speakers of Mandarin adopt some 30 words for building core structures of utterances in conversation, independently of individual speakers. All subjects used these words more than three times. The occurrences of these 30 core words make up about 80% of the overall tokens in conversation. Interestingly but also expected in conversational dialogues, the distribution of token frequency across all subjects is highly symmetric (Tseng 2001). For instance, verbs “is located”, “is”, “that is”, “say”, “want” and “have” were frequently used, so were pronouns “s/he”, “you” and “I”. The negation</context>

In the literature, there is still no consistent definition for discourse markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993). Discourse markers can be defined as follows: elements whose original semantic meaning tends to decrease and their use in spoken discourse becomes more pragmatic and indicative of discourse structuring are discourse markers. In addition to several adverbs and determiners, discourse particles can also be categorized as discourse markers. They are very often observed in Mandarin spoken conversations as mentioned in Tseng (2001) and Clancy et al. (1996). In Tseng (2001), each subject used on average 1.6 discourse particles per turn. This result leads to the consideration, if there is a need to add special categories for discourse particles or particle-like words for spoken Mandarin. Discourse particles were found to have different and specific discourse use in conversation. Namely, there exist discourse particles appearing preferably in turn-beginning position and some other discourse particles may exclusively mark the location of repairs. Regarding the small size of data used in Tseng (2001), it is one of the reason</context>

Thus, how to annotate overlapping sequences is one of the essential tasks in developing annotation systems. In Mandarin conversation, there are words preferably used in turn-initial position (Tseng 2001, Chui 2000). They normally have their own discourse-related pragmatic function associated with their positioning in utterances. Similarly, how to mark up turn-initial positions is also directly connected with the annotation convention. 1.4 Prosody in Spoken Mandarin Lexical tones are typically characteristic of spoken Mandarin. The interaction of lexical tones and the other prosodic means such as stress and intonation are related to a number of research issues, particularly in conversation. Falling tones may not show falling tendency anymore, when the associated words are used for specific di</context>
