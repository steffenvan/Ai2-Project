We present two approaches to time expres-
sion identification, as entered in to SemEval-
2015 Task 6, Clinical TempEval. The first
is a comprehensive rule-based approach that
favoured recall, and which achieved the best
recall for time expression identification in Clin-
ical TempEval. The second is an SVM-based
system built using readily available compo-
nents, which was able to achieve a competi-
tive F1 in a short development time. We dis-
cuss how the two approaches perform relative
to each other, and how characteristics of the
corpus affect the suitability of different ap-

SemEval-2015 Task 6, Clinical TempEval (Bethard et
al., 2015), was a temporal information extraction task
over the clinical domain. The combined University
of Sheffield/Federal University of Parana team fo-
cused on identification of spans and features for time
expressions (TIMEX3), based on specific annotation
guidelines (TS and TA subtasks).
For time expressions, participants identified ex-
pression spans within the text and their corresponding
classes: DATE, TIME, DURATION, QUANTIFIER,
PREPOSTEXP or SET.1 Participating systems had
to annotate timexes according to the guidelines for
the annotation of times, events and temporal rela-

lines (Styler et al., 2014) – which is an extension of
ISO TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010) developed
by the THYME project.2 Further, ISO TimeML ex-
tends two other guidelines: a) TimeML Annotation
Guidelines (Sauri et al., 2006), and b) TIDES 2005
Standard for the Annotation of Temporal Expressions
(Ferro et al., 2005). Clinical TempEval temporal ex-
pression results3 were given in terms of Precision,
Recall and F1-score for identifying spans and classes
of temporal expressions.
For Clinical TempEval two datasets were provided.
The first was a training dataset comprising 293 doc-
uments with a total number 3818 annotated time ex-
pressions. The second dataset comprised 150 docu-
ments with 2078 timexes. This was used for evalua-
tion and was then made available to participants, after
evaluations were completed. Annotations identified
the span and class of each timex. Table 1 shows the
number of annotated timex by class in each dataset.
We present a rule-based and a SVM-based ap-
proach to time expression identification, and we dis-
cuss how they perform relative to each other, and how
characteristics of the corpus affect outcomes and the
suitability of the two approaches.

2 HINX: A Rule-Based Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999494666666667">
HINX is a rule-based system developed using
GATE4 (Cunningham et al., 2011). It executes a
hierarchical set of rules and scripts in an information
extraction pipeline that can be split into the 3 mod-
ules: 1) text pre-processing; 2) timex identification;
and 3) timex normalisation, which are described be-
low. These modules identify and normalise temporal
concepts, starting from finding basic tokens, then
grouping such tokens into more complex expressions,
and finally normalising their features. An additional
step was included to produce the output files in the
desired format.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968119">
2.1 Text Pre-processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975857142857">
This module is used to pre-process the documents
and identify the document creation time (DCT).
HINX used GATE’s ANNIE (Cunningham et al.,
2011) – a rule-based system that was not specifically
adapted to clinical domain – to provide tokenization,
sentence splitting and part of speech (POS) tagging.
We used the Unicode Alternate Tokenizer provided
by GATE to split the text into very simple tokens
such as numbers, punctuation and words. The Sen-
tence Splitter identifies sentence boundaries, making
it possible to avoid creating a timex that connects
tokens from different sentences or paragraphs. POS
Tagging produces a part-of-speech tag as an annota-
tion on each word or symbol, which is useful in cases
such as identifying whether the word “may” is being
used as a verb or as a noun (the month).
We use rules written in JAPE, GATE’s pattern
matching language, to identify the DCT annotation
reference within the “[meta]” tag at the beginning
of each document. The DCT value was split into
different features to be stored at the document level –

2.2 Timex Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987625">
This module uses a set of hierarchical JAPE rules to
combine 15 kinds of basic temporal tokens into more
complex expressions, as described in the sequence of
steps given below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996694875">
• Numbers: A set of rules is used to identify
numbers that are written in a numeric or a non-
numeric format, as numbers as words (e.g. “two
and a half”).
• Temporal tokens: Every word that can be used
to identify temporal concepts is annotated as a
basic temporal token - e.g. temporal granulari-
ties; periods of the day; names of months; days
of the week; season names; words that represent
past, present and future references; and words
that can give an imprecise sense to a temporal
expression (e.g. the word “few” in “the last
few days”). Additionally, as a requirement for
Clinical TempEval, we included specific rules
to identify those words that corresponded to a
timex of class PREPOSTEXP (e.g. “postopera-
tive” and “pre-surgical”).
• Basic expressions: A set of rules identifies the
basic temporal expressions, including explicit
dates and times in different formats (e.g. “2014”,
“15th of November”, “12:30”), durations (e.g.
“24 hours”, “the last 3 months”), quantifiers, and
isolated temporal tokens that can be normalised.
• Complex expressions: Complex expressions
are formed by connecting two basic expressions
or a basic expression with a temporal token.
These represent information corresponding to
ranges of values (e.g. “from July to August
this year”), full timestamps (e.g. “Mar-03-2010
09:54:31”), referenced points in time (e.g. “last
month”), and precise pre/post-operative periods
(e.g. “two days postoperative”).
• SETs: Temporal expressions denoting a SET
(number of times and frequency, or just fre-
quency) are identified by this specific set of
rules (e.g. “twice-a-day”, “three times every
month”, “99/minute”, “every morning”).
• Imprecise expressions: These expressions
comprise language-specific structures used to
refer to imprecise periods of time, including im-
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.995617">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940222222222">
precise expressions defined with boundaries (e.g.
“around 9-11 pm yesterday”), imprecise values
of a given temporal granularity (e.g. “a few days
ago”, “the coming months”), precise and impre-
cise references (e.g. “that same month”, “the
end of last year”, “the following days”), impre-
cise sets (e.g. “2 to 4 times a day”), and vague
expressions (e.g. “some time earlier”, “a long
time ago”).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993608">
2.3 Timex Normalisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940409090909">
As the above identification process is run, the ba-
sic temporal tokens are combined to produce more
complex annotations. Annotation features on these
complex annotations are used to store specific time
values, for use by the normalisation process. Such
features comprise explicit values like “year=2004”,
references to the document creation time/DCT (e.g.
“month=(DCT.month)+1” for the expression “in
the following month”, and “day=(DCT.day)-3” in
“three days ago”), and a direct reference to the
last mentioned timex in the previous sentences (e.g.
“year=LAST.year” for the timex “April” in “In Febru-
ary 2002,... Then, in April,...”).
The normalisation process uses these features to
calculate corresponding final values. It also captures
a set of other characteristics, including the precision
of an expression, and whether or not it represents a
boundary period of time. This last one is used to split
the DURATION timexes into two different DATE
expressions, as explicitly defined in the THYME An-
notation Guidelines (e.g. “between November/2012
and March/2013”).

3 Using an SVM-Based Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992228571429">
GATE provides an integration of LibSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2011) technology with some modifications
enabling effective rapid prototyping for the task of
locating and classifying named entities. This was
used to quickly achieve competitive results. An ini-
tial system was created in a few hours, and although
a couple of days were spent trying parameter and
feature variants, the initial results could not be im-
proved. No development effort was required, the
system being used as “off the shelf” software.
State of the art machine learning approaches to
timex recognition often use sequence labeling (e.g.
CRF) to find timex bounds (UzZaman et al., 2013),
then a use separate instance-based classification step
(e.g. with SVM) to classify them (Sun et al., 2013).
Our approach uses SVM to implement separate
named entity recognizers for each class, then makes
a final selection for each span based on probability.
GATE’s LibSVM integration incorporates the uneven
margins parameter (UM) (Li et al., 2009), which
has been shown to improve results on imbalanced
datasets especially for smaller corpora. In position-
ing the hyperplane further from the (smaller) positive
set, we compensate for a tendency in smaller cor-
pora for the larger (negative) class to push away the
separator in a way that it doesn’t tend to do when suf-
ficient positive examples exist for them to populate
their space more thoroughly, as this default behaviour
can result in poor generalization and a conservative
model. Since NLP tasks such as NER often do in-
volve imbalanced datasets, this inclusion, as well as
robust default implementation choices for NLP tasks,
make it easy to get a respectable result quickly using
GATE’s SVM/UM, as our entry demonstrates. The
feature set used is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.795634833333333">
• String and part of speech of the current token
plus the preceding and ensuing five.
• If a date has been detected for this span using the
Date Normalizer rule-based date detection and
normalization resource in GATE, then the type
of date in this location is included as a feature.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99744525">
The mere presence of such a date annotation
may be the most important aspect of this feature.
Note that this Date Normalizer was not used in
HINX, which used a custom solution.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9649482">
• As above, but using the “complete” feature on
the date, to indicate whether the date present in
this location is a fully qualified date. This may
be of value as an indicator of the quality of the
rule-based date annotation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.929493222222222">
A probabilistic polynomial SVM is used, of order
3. Probabilistic SVMs allow us to apply confidence
thresholds later, so we may: 1) tune to the imbalanced
dataset and task constraints, 2) use the “one vs. rest”
method for transforming the multiclass problem to a
set of binary problems, and 3) select the final class for
the time expression. In the “one vs. rest” approach,
one classifier is created for each class, allowing it to
be separated from all others, and the class with the

highest confidence score is chosen. A UM of 0.4 is
selected based on previous work (Li et al., 2005).
Two classifiers are trained for each class; one to
identify the start of the entity and another to iden-
tify the end. This information is then post-processed
into entity spans first by removing orphaned start or
end tags and secondly by filtering out entities with
lengths (in number of words) that did not appear in
the training data. Finally, where multiple annota-
tions overlap, a confidence score is used to select the
strongest candidate. A separate confidence score is
also used to remove weak entities.
Table 2 shows negligible difference between a lin-
ear and polynomial SVM (degree 3). A confidence
threshold of 0.25 was selected empirically. Task train-
ing data was split 50:50 to form training and test sets
to produce these figures. An additional experiment
involved including the output from the HINX rule-
based system as features for the SVM. This did not
improve the outcome.

4 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980236363637">
We submitted 5 runs using the HINX system and 2
runs using our SVM approach to Clinical TempEval.
Results of both systems are shown in Table 3. For
completeness, both SVM runs submitted are included.
However the only difference between the two is that
SVM-2 included the full training set, whereas SVM-1
included only the half reserved for testing at develop-
ment time, and submitted as a backup for its quality
of being a tested model. As expected, including more
training data leads to a slightly superior result, and
the fact that the improvement is small suggests the
training set is adequate in size.
The HINX runs shown in Table 3 correspond to
the following variants: 1) using preposition “at” as
part of the timex span; 2) disregarding timexes of
class QUANTIFIER; 3) using full measures span
for QUANTIFIERs (e.g. “20 mg”); 4) considering
measure tokens as non-markable expressions; and
5) disregarding QUANTIFIERs that represent mea-
sures. The timex type QUANTIFIER was targeted
in different submitted runs as it was not clear how
these expressions were annotated when comparing
the training corpus to the annotation guidelines.
The HINX system had the best Recall over all
Clinical TempEval systems in both subtasks. The
low precision of the rule-based system was, however,
a surprise, and led us to examine the training and
test corpora in detail. While we would expect to
see inconsistencies in any manually created corpus,
we found a surprising number of repeated inconsis-
tencies between the guidelines and the corpora for
certain very regular and unambiguous temporal lan-
guage constructs. These included: a) timex span and
class inconsistencies, b) non-markable expressions
that were annotated as timexes, c) many occurrences
of SET expressions that were not manually annotated
in the corpus, and d) inconsistencies in the set of
manually annotated QUANTIFIERs. Had these in-
consistencies not been present in the gold standard,
HINX would have attained a precision between 0.85
and 0.90 (Tissot et al., 2015).
We suggest that inconsistent data such as this will
tend to lower the precision of rule-based systems.
To illustrate this, we ran HeidelTime (Str¨otgen et
al., 2013) on this year’s dataset and found that pre-
cision and recall were low (0.44; 0.49) despite this
being a demonstrably successful system in TempEval-
3. Similarly low results can be observed from
ClearTK-TimeML (0.593; 0.428), used to evaluate
the THYME Corpus (Styler et al., 2014). Systems
were run “as-is”, unadapted to the clinical domain.
Styler et al. (2014) suggest that clinical narratives
introduce new challenges for temporal information
extraction systems, and performance degrades when
moving to this domain. However, they do not con-

sider how far performance can be impaired by incon-
sistencies in the annotated corpus.
The appearance of a superior result by our machine
learning system, which is agnostic about what infor-
mation it uses to replicate the annotators’ assertions,
is therefore not to be taken at face value. A machine
learning system may have learned regularities in an
annotation style, rather than having learned to ac-
curately find time expressions. This is an example
of data bias (Hovy et al., 2014). Machine learning
systems have a flexibility and power in finding non-
obvious cues to more subtle patterns, which makes
them successful in linguistically complex tasks, but
also gives them a deceptive appearance of success
where the irregularity in a task comes not from its
inherent complexity but from flaws in the dataset.

The combined University of Sheffield/Federal University of Parana team focused on identification of spans and features for time expressions (TIMEX3), based on specific annotation guidelines (TS and TA subtasks). For time expressions, participants identified expression spans within the text and their corresponding classes: DATE, TIME, DURATION, QUANTIFIER, PREPOSTEXP or SET.1 Participating systems had to annotate timexes according to the guidelines for the annotation of times, events and temporal rela1There was no time norma</context>

Then, in April,...”). The normalisation process uses these features to calculate corresponding final values. It also captures a set of other characteristics, including the precision of an expression, and whether or not it represents a boundary period of time. This last one is used to split the DURATION timexes into two different DATE expressions, as explicitly defined in the THYME Annotation Guidelines (e.g. “between November/2012 and March/2013”). 3 Using an SVM-Based Approach GATE provides an integration of LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) technology with some modifications enabling effective rapid prototyping for the task of locating and classifying named entities. This was used to quickly achieve competitive results.

The appearance of a superior result by our machine learning system, which is agnostic about what information it uses to replicate the annotators’ assertions, is therefore not to be taken at face value. A machine learning system may have learned regularities in an annotation style, rather than having learned to accurately find time expressions. This is an example of data bias (Hovy et al., 2014). Machine learning systems have a flexibility and power in finding nonobvious cues to more subtle patterns, which makes them successful in linguistically complex tasks, but also gives them a deceptive appearance of success where the irregularity in a task comes not from its inherent complexity but from flaws in the dataset.

These included: a) timex span and class inconsistencies, b) non-markable expressions that were annotated as timexes, c) many occurrences of SET expressions that were not manually annotated in the corpus, and d) inconsistencies in the set of manually annotated QUANTIFIERs. Had these inconsistencies not been present in the gold standard, HINX would have attained a precision between 0.85 and 0.90 (Tissot et al., 2015). We suggest that inconsistent data such as this will tend to lower the precision of rule-based systems. To illustrate this, we ran HeidelTime (Str¨otgen et al., 2013) on this year’s dataset and found that precision and recall were low (0.44; 0.49) despite this being a demonstrably successful system in TempEval3. Similarly low results can be observed from ClearTK-TimeML (0.593; 0.428), used to evaluate the THYME Corpus (Styler et al., 2014). Systems were run “as-is”, unadapted to the clinical domain.

Our approach uses SVM to implement separate named entity recognizers for each class, then makes a final selection for each span based on probability. GATE’s LibSVM integration incorporates the uneven margins parameter (UM) (Li et al., 2009), which has been shown to improve results on imbalanced datasets especially for smaller corpora. In positioning the hyperplane further from the (smaller) positive set, we compensate for a tendency in smaller corpora for the larger (negative) class to</context>
