<bodyText confidence="0.999977736842105">
This paper presents a methodology
for the automatic acquisition of lex-
ical and morpho—syntactic informa-
tion from raw corpora. The system
uses information about the inflec-
tional morphology declared by rules
and is based on the co—occurrence of
different forms of the same paradigm
in the corpus. A direct application
of this methodology gives very poor
precision rates due to rule interac-
tion between paradigms. We present
a rule analysis algorithm that solves
this problem, giving quite better pre-
cision rates, although recall decreases
dramatically. Finally, we investigate
some techniques to raise the recall,
achieving recall rates around 67%
with a precision of 92%.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.991916619047619">
The implementation of different NLP applica-
tions requires a lot of lexical information. In
particular, the construction of word—form lists
usually requires a lot of human effort. In this
paper we present a method for the automatic
acquisition of lexical and morpho—syntantic in-
formation from raw corpora. The main goal is
to acquire a complete list of word—forms with
the associated morpho—syntactic information,
expressed with tags that follow the Multext
recommendations (Veronis and Khouri, 1995;
Erj avec, 2001) (e.g., form: mocmana; lemma:
mocm; POS/TAG: NCMSI; all expressed as
mocmana:mocm:NCMS1).
This methodology could be very useful for
those languages that do not have such word—
form lists available, and suitable to enrich ex-
isting word—form lists.
The knowledge about morphology is ex-
pressed by means of rules. Some previous
works used a symilar formalism, for exam-
ple (Sanfilippo, 1990) for English and Ital-
ian. Other works on slavic morphology are
(Sheremetyeva et al., 1998; Mikheev and Li-
ubushkina, 1995) for Russian, and (Tadie,
1994) for Croatian.
The system searches for co—occurrences of
different forms of the same paradigm in
the corpus to infer the associated lemma
and morpho—syntactic characteristics. Experi-
ments of this methodology were firstly carried
out for Croatian (Oliver et al., 2002). In this
paper we present, on the one hand, an exten-
sion for Russian that includes an algorithm for
the analysis of the interaction between rules of
different paradigms, and, on the other hand, a
technique for improving recall.
Our task is similar to the learning of word—
category for unknown words, as in (Mikheev,
1996a; Mikheev, 1996b). Nevertheless, in our
methodology almost all words are unknown
and more detailed morpho—syntactic informa-
tion, as well as the lemma, is acquired.
This paper is organized as follows: section 2
presents the main components of the acqui-
sition system. In section 3 the acquisition
methodology and its main drawbacks are ex-
plained. Section 4 deals with rule ambiguity
and describes the rule analysis algorithm. Sec-
tion 5 focuses some techniques for improving
the acquisition process and in section 6 the
results obtained in the experiments are pre-
sented. Section 7 concludes and outlines some
lines of future research.
2 Components of the acquisition
system
The system is composed by several analysis
modules. First, non—inflectional and irregular
forms are dealt with by means of a predefined
list. In the second module, the decomposition
of the rest of the forms is made by morpholog-
ical rules. The source of word forms is a raw
corpus.

The words that belong to non—inflectional and
closed categories are excluded from the acqui-

As can be seen, adverbs are provisionally in-

ered as a closed class. In the near future, we
are planning to include derivative rules for the
most productive processes of adverb formation
from other categories.

2.2 Irregular word list

<bodyText confidence="0.999955375">
Irregular words are also excluded from the ac-
quisition process. These words are declared
in a list that includes all forms with the asso-
ciated lemma and morpho—syntactic informa-
tion. This list is currently being developed by
hand. Our criterion is to write all forms of
the irregular words included in the 5,000 most
frequent words (Sharov, 2001).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998806">
2.3 Morphological rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968625">
Morphological rules are implemented following
a morphological stripping formalism (Alshawi,
1992). These rules are converted into Perl reg-
ular expressions at running time. The rules are
of the form FE:LE:Desc, where: FE stands for
the form ending, LE for the lemma ending, and
Desc for morphological description. For exam-
ple, the generic rule
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.497062">
om::NCMSI
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887">
can express the entry MOCTOM : MOCT : NCMSI. As
it can be observed, this rule expresses a null
lemma ending. By using Perl regular expres-
sions we can describe the lemma ending with
more precision. An example can be seen in the
following rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.568543">
( [-aHeammoyloblcrxxcuiTu_0] ) om : \ 1 : NCMSI
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989142857143">
where &apos; means the complementary set of sym-
bols written between square brackets and &apos; \1&apos;
is a variable representing the symbol matched
by the regular expression between brackets.
Regular expressions allow to express other
complex morphological phenomena, such as
vowel alternation. For example, the rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.421475">
ab([-aseammoymblcrxxillmtinfifla:Ne\1:NCMSG
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999079">
can express an entry as ,nbsa:,nes:NCMSG.
Table 2 shows the number of rules manually
developed for each part of speech.
The rules have been developed following the
most productive models in (Zaliznjak, 1977).
The high number of rules corresponding to
verbs is due to the fact that some forms, as
participles, are declinable. The rules corre-
sponding to declined forms are derived auto-
matically from the rule that expresses the base

form. Not all the rules will be used in the
acquisition process. Those rules expressing al-
ternative endings equal to other endings in the
paradigm are left out. For example, the rule
([-aHeammoyloblcrxHinuvrli4i;d)a: \1:NCMPN
that expresses the alternative plural nomina-
tive in a for the masculine nouns, is left out
because the FE &apos;a&apos; is equal to that of the geni-
tive singular.
In execution time, rules are transformed into
Perl substitutions, for example the rule
([-Krxxium-ru])y: \1a:NCFSA
is transformed into the substitution
sI( L&apos;ECTXXIIIIIV,ILO )y/\1a/
This expression means &amp;quot;change the final y,
if the preceding letter is not on the list
{K,r,x,x,m,m,=1,i4)- and replace this y by an
a&amp;quot;. This substitution allows the formation of
the lemma of a feminine noun from its singular
accusative.

<bodyText confidence="0.99579275">
The acquisition methodology is described in
figure 1. The corpus is seen as a list of
all the word—forms appearing in it. For
example, let us consider that the corpus

is formed by all the word—forms of the
paradigms of the lemma ocm, that is: ocm,
Awcma, Awcmax, Awcma,m, ,naocma,mu, mocme,
mocmana, mOCT/108, mocmy and AtOCrint. The
algorithm takes one form, for example
mocmana, and verifies if the form is an excep-
tion or a word belonging to a closed class. In
this case, it is neither one, so the algorithm
goes to the next step and searches for an ap-
plicable morphological rule. In the example
one applicable rule is
([eammoyloblcrxxonTm_0])om:\1:NCMSI
For the word—form mocmana the lemma mocm
is hypothesized by applying the rule. The algo-
rithm then verifies if the hypothesized lemma
appears in the corpus. If so, the algorithm con-
structs a lexical entry with the form, the as-
sociated lemma, and the morpho—syntactic in-
formation of the applied rule. In our example
mocmana:mocm:NCMSI.

lemma, but a simple occurrence in the corpus
does not assure that what the system hypothe-
sizes is actually a lemma. It may be any other
form of the paradigm. Let us consider one ex-
ample of this situation using the word-form
Atocmy. By applying the rule
( Vicrxxinuvrn0 )y : \ 1a : NCFSA
the algorithm hypothesizes the lemma mocma,
which exists in the corpus. However, this is
not a lemma but the singular genitive of ocm.
Therefore, the algorithm wrongly creates a lex-
ical entry: Atocmy:Atocma:NCFSA.
This fact shows us that interferences be-
tween the morphological rules exist and that
rules cannot be straightforwardly applied in
the acquisition process.
One simple approach is to set up a minimal
number of rules that must be applied to vali-
date a lemma. In other words, to set a mini-
mum number of times the lemma is hypothe-
sized. In the first prototypes for the Croatian
language this number was empirically set to 3,
achieving a precision of 88.9%. However, no
figures of recall were available.
Another approach consists of previously
identifying ambiguous and non-ambiguous
rules in order to devise incremental application
procedures that guarantee no interferences be-
tween rules.
All the rules with equal FE and LE (the
rules that form the lemma) are ambiguous, be-
cause in the acquisition process the hypothe-
sized lemma is equal to the form and it vali-
dates itself. For the rest of the rules the anal-
ysis is more complex because there is an inter-
action between endings and roots and because
up to three paradigms can be implied in the
ambiguity. For example, let us consider the
following three rules:
ymero:am:VIPPOSMGA,VIPPOSNGA
aTb:aTHTb :VIMO2S0
pymero:epeTb:VIPPOSMGA,VIPPOSNGA
And the following forms: mpyuyeao (present
participle of mepemb, singular genitive, mas-
culine or neutre) and mpamt, (imperative of
mpamumb). The algorithm will wrongly ac-
quire the entry:
*mpyuyeao:mpamb:VIPPOSMGA,VIPPOSNGA
applying the first rule.
An efficient algorithm to analyze the rules
and classify them as either ambiguous or non-
ambiguous is necessary. First approach to this
algorithm considered a list of embedded if-
then-else conditions, with ad hoc conditions for
the Russian language. This approach gave us
good results, but nevertheless we preferred to
develop a more general algorithm that could
be applied to other languages (at least to
languages with a concatenative morphology).
The strategy of the work consists of convert-
ing the rule analysis into a controlled acqui-
sition by using a pseudo-form-list. The com-
parison of the results of that acquisition with
the pseudo-form-list lets us classify rules as
either ambiguous or non-ambiguous. The full
process is explained in the following 6 points:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957382">
1. Rule expansion Rules expressing mor-
phological contexts are expanded to all
their possibilities. For example:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.971304285714286">
( [-aHeammoyloblcrximuiTu4ii])om: \l:NCMSI
is expanded to the following rules:
som:s:NCMSI cl)om:c1):NCMSI Tom:T:NCMSI
com:c:NCMSI pom:p:NCMSI nom:n:NCMSI
mom:m:NCMSI mom:m:NCMSI mom:m:NCMSI
som:s:NCMSI Aom:A:NCMSI mom:m:NCMSI
6om:6:NCMSI
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.94913225">
2. Rule filtering with final letter n-grams
The expansion of the rules leads to a mul-
tiplication of the number of rules. Some of
these rules cannot be applied because the
combinations of final letters expressed by
the rules are not found in the language
(or at least are not found in the corpus).
After rule expansion, rules are filtered us-
ing the set of letter n-grams extracted
from the word-form endings in our cor-
pus. By this process a large number of
rules that cannot be applied are elimi-
nated, and make the rest of the process
faster.
In the filtering process of the example
above, the rule 10M :1 : NOS&apos; was elimi-
nated because the ending lom is not found
in the corpus. No matter if the ending ac-
tually exists, as if it does not exist in our
corpus the rule is not applicable.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.728906">
3. Creation of the pseudo-form-list In
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998839666666667">
this step a list of pseudo-word-forms
is created with the associated pseudo-
lemma and the morpho-syntactic in-
formation. This list has the form
CODE+TF:CODE+TL:POS/TAG. The code is
related to the part of speech. For
example, following the same example
above, the following pseudo-word-form
list would be created:

</table>
<listItem confidence="0.690759652173913">
4. Acquisition process with the pseudo—
forms After the creation of the pseudo-
form-list an acquisition process is per-
formed with the pseudo-forms and the
remaining rules. This acquisition pro-
cess will give correct and incorrect re-
sults. An example of a correct acquisition
is NCMTom:NCMT :NCMSI, and an example of
an incorrect one is NCMTy:NCMTa:NCFSA.
With each acquisition, the rule used to do
it is stored. This information will be use-
ful for the next step.
5. Verification and detection of ambiguous
rules At this point, the result of the acqui-
sition can be compared with the expected
result (the pseudo-form-list itself). Since
the rule used for each acquisition has been
stored, those rules leading to acquisition
errors can be now classified as ambiguous.
6. Creation of the list of non-ambiguous
rules The rules not leading to any ac-
quisition error will be classified as unam-
biguous.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.6318215" genericHeader="method">
5 Improved acquisition
methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999573">
By the rule analysis algorithm it is possible to
know which rules will lead to acquisition errors
and which will not. The improved acquisition
methodology consists of two steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.740423333333333">
• Acquisition with non-ambiguous rules.
The lemmas acquired in this step will be
correct with a high reliability.
• Acquisition with ambiguous rules and val-
idation of the acquisition with the lemmas
acquired in the first step.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986775">
In fact, for practical reasons, we made the two
steps jointly in a single acquisition process with
all the rules (storing the rule used for each ac-
quisition). All the acquisitions made with un-
ambiguous rules were validated and also those
acquisitions made with ambiguous rules but
with a lemma acquired with an unambiguous
rule.

6 Experimental evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987384615385">
A test corpus has been built only with regu-
lar and known forms, large enough and with
a distribution of lemmas and forms as real as
possible. All the forms are known so the result
of each experiment can be evaluated automat-
ically. The test corpus was built as follows: A
word-form list was created with all the forms
of 78,519 lemmas, totalling 1,247,202 forms.
Each of these forms was included only if it oc-
curs in our 16,000,000 word corpus of Russian
texts. The result is a corpus of 232,770 regular
word forms corresponding to 43,543 lemmas.
This corpus is, in fact, a word-form list.

this experimental setting.

sion and recall in the experimental setting
The results given so far are calculated in an
alphabetic basis, that is, all the process is done
with all the words beginning with a given letter
and repeated for each letter.
It is also interesting to observe, that
the different parts of speech have different
behaviours. The next figures show the per-
centages of nouns, adjectives and verbs in the
corpus and in the result of the acquisition:

Table 4: Part of speech distribution in the ac-
quisition
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999725166666667">
As we can see, the category of verb is the
most acquired part of speech. This result
can be explained by the fact that the verb is
the part of speech which has more forms per
lemma and also because nouns and adjectives
have more ambiguous rules between them.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998234">
6.3 Improvement of recall
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943352945945946">
Some previous experiments showed that the
smaller the corpus, the higher the recall. This
is mainly due to the fact that the rule analy-
sis uses the final n—grams of the word forms
present in the corpus. If the corpus is small,
the amount of ambiguous rules is small too, so
the recall improves. To treat the whole corpus
as a collection of smaller corpora where higher
recall could be achieved, the acquisition pro-
cess was repeated alphabetically in groups of
two and three initial letters. The results are
presented in table 5.
Using this approach, significant improve-
ments in recall were obtained, with a slight
drop in precision (p: 91.93%; r: 67.19%). We
think that the still low results of recall can be
explained mainly by two factors:
• A great amount of morphological rules are
ambiguous for the acquisition task. The
rule analysis in an alphabetic basis gives,
on average, 32.96 % of unambiguous rules.
• Not all the forms of a paradigm are
present in the corpus. Besides, for some
paradigms, the lemma is not present. The
methodology searches for the hypothe-
sized lemma in the corpus, but if it is not
present no acquisition will be made for the
paradigm.
To evaluate the effect of the second cause
one more acquisition experiment was per-
formed with an artificially modified corpus.
The modification consisted of the inclusion of
all the lemmas of the forms present in the test
corpus. The inclusion of all the lemmas gives
a slight increase of recall of about 6 %, con-
firming that the main cause for the low recall
is the great amount of ambiguous rules.

syntantic information. This methodology has
been applied to a large corpus of Russian. Re-
sults for precision are quite good, but the main
drawback of the methodology is a relatively
low recall.
A new acquisition method that does not
need the presence of the lemma in the corpus
to validate the acquisition is currently under
progress. This enhaced algorithm will acquire
an entry even if the lemma is not present in
the corpus. Also, to validate some of the ac-
quisitions made with ambiguous rules, the con-
text of occurrence in the corpus will be used.
In some cases, the surrounding words can be
tagged with the information acquired so far,
and this information can be used to confirm a
hypothesis or to reject it. This approach will
be specially useful for nouns and adjectives,
which are indeed the categories with lower re-
call.
In the experiments conducted so far, mor-
phological rules have been written by hand
based on traditional grammars as (Zalizn-
jak, 1977) for Russian and (Bane et al.,
1995) for Croatian. We plan to develope
some algorithms to learn the most productives
paradigms from the raw corpus, as in (Gold-
smith, 2001). These algorithms will allow to
learn also the most productive derivative pro-
cesses.
Future work includes testing these method-
ologies in other languages, such as Croatian,
Spanish and Catalan.

<abstract confidence="0.99810865">This paper presents a methodology for the automatic acquisition of lexical and morpho—syntactic information from raw corpora. The system uses information about the inflectional morphology declared by rules and is based on the co—occurrence of different forms of the same paradigm in the corpus. A direct application of this methodology gives very poor precision rates due to rule interaction between paradigms. We present a rule analysis algorithm that solves this problem, giving quite better precision rates, although recall decreases dramatically. Finally, we investigate some techniques to raise the recall, achieving recall rates around 67% with a precision of 92%.</abstract>

In the near future, we are planning to include derivative rules for the most productive processes of adverb formation from other categories. 2.2 Irregular word list Irregular words are also excluded from the acquisition process. These words are declared in a list that includes all forms with the associated lemma and morpho—syntactic information. This list is currently being developed by hand. Our criterion is to write all forms of the irregular words included in the 5,000 most frequent words (Sharov, 2001). 2.3 Morphological rules Morphological rules are implemented following a morphological stripping formalism (Alshawi, 1992). These rules are converted into Perl regular expressions at running time. The rules are of the form FE:LE:Desc, where: FE stands for the form ending, LE for the lemma ending, and Desc for morphological description. For example, the generic rule om::NCMSI can express the entry MOCTOM : MOCT : NCMSI. As it can be observed, this rule expresses a null lemma ending. By using Perl regular expressions we can describe the lemma ending with more precision. An example can be seen i</context>

In particular, the construction of word—form lists usually requires a lot of human effort. In this paper we present a method for the automatic acquisition of lexical and morpho—syntantic information from raw corpora. The main goal is to acquire a complete list of word—forms with the associated morpho—syntactic information, expressed with tags that follow the Multext recommendations (Veronis and Khouri, 1995; Erj avec, 2001) (e.g., form: mocmana; lemma: mocm; POS/TAG: NCMSI; all expressed as mocmana:mocm:NCMS1).

The rules have been developed following the most productive models in (Zaliznjak, 1977). The high number of rules corresponding to verbs is due to the fact that some forms, as participles, are declinable.
