1 Introduction

A theory of discourse interpretation has to deal with
a set of problems including anaphora resolution and
the hierarchical ordering of discourse structure:

Peter. Some students wrote fancy invitation
cards. Some other students bought exotic food.
But Peter didn&apos;t like it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968653846154">
There are two conceivable readings for (1). Either
(a) it refers to the party or (b) Peter only disliked
the food. Discourse grammars like Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory (SDRT) offer an ex-
planation for this phenomenon. SDRT — an exten-
sion of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) — describes a
complex propositional structure of Discourse Rep-
resentation Structures (DRSs) connected via dis-
course relations. The hierarchical ordering imposed
by relations like narration or elaboration can be
used to make predictions about possible attachment
sites within the already processed discourse as well
as suitable antecedents of anaphora.
The next section discusses the question of
whether the SDRT formalisation used for discourse
structure should also capture the ambiguities, as
expressed in (1), for instance, via an underspec-
ified representation. Section 3 introduces a tree
logic proposed by Kallmeyer called TDG. Follow-
ing Schilder (1997), this formalism is employed for
the representation of the discourse structure. Sec-
tion 4 presents the conjoined version of SDRT and
TDG. This is a novel combination of the discourse
grammar and a tree logic indicating the hierarchical
discourse structure. Finally, a USDRT formalisation
of the discourse example discussed is given.

One obvious shortcoming DRT is that it lacks the
rhetorical information that structures the text. This
rhetorical information, expressed by discourse rela-
tions such as narration or background, has a crucial
effect on anaphora resolution, lexical disambigua-
tion, and spatial-temporal information. SDRT ex-
tends DRT in order to amend this insufficiency.
Following Asher (1996) DRSs and SDRSs will
be labelled ({Ki,., Kn}). Formally, an SDRS is
recursively defined as a pair of sets containing la-
belled DRSs or SDRSs, and the discourse relations
holding between them.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.827231857142857">
Definition 1 (SDRS) Let K1 : Kn an
be a labelled DRSs or SDRSs and R a set of dis-
course relations. The tuple (U, Con) is an SDRS
if (a) U is a labelled DRS and Con = 0 or (b)
U = , KO and Con is a set of SDRS con-
ditions. An SDRS condition is a discourse relation
such as D(Ki, , KO, where D E R.

<bodyText confidence="0.972282454545454">
For the basic case (i.e. (K,0)) K labels a DRS rep-
resenting the semantic context of a sentence. A
discourse relation introduces furthermore a hierar-
chical ordering indicated by a graph representation.
The nodes represent the labelled SDRSs and the
edges are discourse relations. Apart from the dis-
course relations, which impose a hierarchical or-
dering, &apos;topic&apos; relations add more structure to this
graph. If a sentence a is the topic of another sen-
tence 0, this is formalised as a 4). 0.1 This sym-
bol also occurs in the graph, indicating a further
SDRS condition. The graph representation illus-
trates the hierarchical structure of the discourse and
in particular the open attachment site for newly pro-
cessed sentences. Basically the constituents on the
so-called &apos;right frontier&apos; of the discourse structure
are assumed to be available for further attachment
(Webber, 1991).
Assuming a current label (i.e. the one added af-
ter processing the last clause/sentence), a notion of
A further SDRS condition is Focus Background Pair (FBP)
which is introduced by background.

D-Subordination is defined by Asher (1996, P. 24).
Generally speaking, all constituents which domi-
nate the current label are open. A further restric-
tion is introduced by the term D-Freedom which ap-
plies to all labels which are directly dominated by
a topic, unless the label assigns the current node.
Formally speaking, this can be phrased as: a label
K is D-free in an SDRS 3 if current(0) = K or

Note that this in (k5) can refer back either to (a) the
entire Shuttle voyage or (b) the launch of the TDRS
satellite in (k4). It can also be shown that this cannot
be linked to the start of the shuttle described in (k2).
The hierachical structure of the two
first sentences is established by an elab-
oration relation. As a consequence, the
SDRS labelled by K1 is the topic of K2
(i.e. ({K1, K2}, {elaboration(Ki, K2), K1 4-
K2 } ). The next sentence (k3) is a comment to
the situation described in the preceding sentence.
However, a new constituent K1 has to be introduced
into the discourse structure. This SDRS labelled
by Ki subsumes the two DRS s in K2 and K3. As
a side effect, the label K2 within the discourse
relation elaboration(Ki, K2) is changed to the
newly introduced label K1 and a further edge is
introduced between this SDRS and K3. It has to

ploits discourse relations to establish a hierachical
ordering of discourse segments. A constituent graph
indicates the dependencies between the segment, es-
pecially highlighting the open attachment points.
How the discourse relations such as narration or
elaboration are derived is left to an axiomatic the-
ory called DICE (DIscourse in Commonsense En-
tailment) that uses a non-montonic logic. Taking the
reader&apos;s world knowledge and Gricean-style prag-
matic maxims into account, DICE provides a formal
theory of discourse attachment. The main ingre-
dients are defaults describing laws that encode the
knowledge we have about the discourse relation and
discourse processing.2
The following discourse which is similar to
example (1) exemplifies how SDRT deals with
anaphora resolution within a sequence of sentences
(Asher, 1996):
</bodyText>

(2) (k 1) After thirty months, America is back in
space. (k2) The shuttle Discovery roared off the
pad from Cape Kennedy at 10:38 this morning.

munication satellite was sucessfully deployed.

NASA morale.

be pointed out that this modification of the entire
SDRS involves an overwriting of the structure
derived so far. The SDRT update function has to be
designed such that these changes are accordingly
incorporated. Note furthermore that the introduc-
tion of an additional edge from Ki to K3 is not
assigned with a discourse relation.
In order to proceed with the SDRS construction,
we have to consider which constituents are available
for further attachment. According to the definition
of D-Freedom and D-Subordination, the SDRS la-
belled by K1, K2 and K3 are still available.3
We derive using DICE that the next sentence (k4)
is connected to (k2) via narration. The resulting
constituent graph is shown in figure 3. A com-
mon topic as demanded by Asher (1996, p. 28)
does not occur in the graph representation. Finally,
only two attachment sites are left, namely K1 and
K4. The discourse relation result can connect both

SDRSs with the SDRS derived for (k5). Conse-
quently, two antecedents for the anaphora this can
be resolved and the theory predicts two conceivable
derivations: One SDRS contains the SDRS labelled
by K5 attached to K1, whereas the second conceiv-
able SDRS exhibits K5 connected to K4.
Summing up, the formalism includes the follow-
ing shortcomings: (a) The representation of an un-
derspecified discourse is not possible in SDRT. All
readings have to be generated. (b) The formalism
is not monotonic. Updates may overwrite preceed-
ing constituents. As it can be seen from figure 2
a new SDRS K1 substituted K2.4 (c) The con-
stituent graph contains a set of different SDRS con-
ditions (i.e. discourse relations, 4., and FBP). It is
not clear how these different conditions interact and
it seems difficult to predict their effect on the dis-
course structure. Note that the update on narration
requires a common topic which connects the two
SDRSs according to the axioms stipulated within
SDRT. However the relation is not shown in the
constituent graph.
I will develop further ideas introduced by under-
specified semantic formalisms which have been pro-
posed in recent years (e.g. (Reyle, 1995)) in order
to provide an underspecified representation for dis-
course structure. I will employ a first order tree
logic by Kallmeyer (1996) to define an underspeci-
fied SDRT, in the following sections.

(a) N and T are disjoint finite sets for the nonter-

The tree descriptions are formulae in TDGs reflect-
ing the dominance relations between subtrees. Such
formulae have to be negation-free and at least one
k E K must dominate all other k&apos; E K. In order
to combine two tree descriptions an adjunction op-
eration is used which simply conjoins the two tree
descriptions. Graphically, this operation can take
place at the dotted lines indicating the dominance
relation (i.e. &lt;s).The straight line describes the par-
ent relation (i). No adjunction can take place here.

malisms, the SDRSs are labelled and dominance re-

Generally speaking, a discourse relation P provides
the link between DRSs or SDRSs. Similar to the
standard SDRT account, this relation has to be de-
rived by considering world knowledge as well as ad-
ditional discourse knowledge, and is derived within
DICE. I do not consider any changes of the stan-
dard theory in this respect. The structural infor-
mation, however, is encoded by the tree descrip-
tions as introduced in section 3. The most gen-
eral case describing two situations connected by a
(not yet known) discourse relation is formalised as
shown in figure 5.6 The description formula for
this tree is KT &lt;1*Kk1 A Kk1 Kin A K R1 &lt;
K R1&apos; A K Ri i K&apos;Ai A KIR1 s1 A K;11 4* 82.
Comparing this representation with the SDRT con-
stituent graph, the following similarities and differ-
ences can be observed. First of all, the question of
where the open attachment sites are found is easily
observable in the structural restriction given by the

tree description. Graphically, the open nodes are in-
dicated by the dotted lines. Secondly, a topic node is
introduced, immediately dominating the discourse
segment. No distinction between D-Subordination
and D-Freedom has to be made, because the topic
is open for further attachment as well. This is the
main change to the discourse structure proposed by
Schilder (1997). This account encodes the topic
information in an additional feature called PROMI.
However, it gives no formal definition of this term.
I stick therefore to the topic definition Asher gives.
But instead a uniform treatment of the hierarchi-
cal ordering can be given by the tree logic used.
Thirdly, the discourse segment is dominated by
the discourse relation that possesses two daughter
nodes. The structure is flexible enough to allow fur-
ther attachment here. No overwriting of a derived
structure, as for the SDRT account, is necessary.
If a discourse relation is derived, further con-
straints are imposed on the discourse structure. Ba-
sically, two cases can be distinguished: (a) A subor-
dinating structure is triggered by discourse relations
like narration or result. Consequently, the second
situation becomes the topic (i.e. 4-1 : 0) and the
precedence relation between 41 and 41 is intro-
duced. In addition, the open attachment site on the
right frontier gets closed (i.e. 41 P.,- K2). (b) A
subordinated structure which comes with discourse
relations like elaboration or background contains
the first situation as a topic (i.e. K7?-1 : a). For
this structure a precedence relation between K&apos;in.
and Kiln also holds, but instead of the right fron-
tier, the left frontier is closed (i.e. 41 Kr).
Generally speaking, the analysis proposed for (2)
follows the SDRT account, especially regarding the
derivation of the discourse relations. The first two
sentences are connected via elaboration. However,
the analysis differs with respect to the obtained dis-
course structure. Since sentence (kl) (i.e. the se-
mantic content a) is the topic of this text segment

The resulting tree description contains two node
pairs where the dominance relation holds, indicated
by the dotted line in the graphical representation.
Hence there are two possible attachment sites.7
The construction of the discourse sequence con-
tinues in the same way until sentence (k5). The am-
biguity for this can be expressed as illustrated in fig-
ure 6. Sentence (k5) (i.e. .95 : E) is connected via re-
sult with either KL. : a (i.e. this refers to the entire
voyage in (kl)) or ICL3 (i.e. only the launch of the
satellite is referred to by this). Note furthermore that
the latter reading requires that (k5) is an elabora-
tion of (kl). Thus the USDRT analysis provides an
underspecified representation of the discourse struc-
ture which covers the two possible readings of (2).

The graph representation illustrates the hierarchical structure of the discourse and in particular the open attachment site for newly processed sentences. Basically the constituents on the so-called &apos;right frontier&apos; of the discourse structure are assumed to be available for further attachment (Webber, 1991). Assuming a current label (i.e. the one added after processing the last clause/sentence), a notion of A further SDRS condition is Focus Background Pair (FBP) which is introduced by background. 1188 D-Subordination is defined by Asher (1996, P. 24). Generally speaking, all constituents which dominate the current label are open. A further restriction is introduced by the term D-Freedom which applies to all labels which are directly dominated by a topic, unless the label assigns the current node. Formally speaking, this can be phrased as: a label K is D-free in an SDRS 3 if current(0) = K or (K1 K) E Con (see figure 1).

Taking the reader&apos;s world knowledge and Gricean-style pragmatic maxims into account, DICE provides a formal theory of discourse attachment. The main ingredients are defaults describing laws that encode the knowledge we have about the discourse relation and discourse processing.2 The following discourse which is similar to example (1) exemplifies how SDRT deals with anaphora resolution within a sequence of sentences (Asher, 1996): (2) (k 1) After thirty months, America is back in space.

Note furthermore that the introduction of an additional edge from Ki to K3 is not assigned with a discourse relation. In order to proceed with the SDRS construction, we have to consider which constituents are available for further attachment. According to the definition of D-Freedom and D-Subordination, the SDRS labelled by K1, K2 and K3 are still available.3 We derive using DICE that the next sentence (k4) is connected to (k2) via narration. The resulting constituent graph is shown in figure 3. A common topic as demanded by Asher (1996, p. 28) does not occur in the graph representation. Finally, only two attachment sites are left, namely K1 and K4.

Some students wrote fancy invitation cards. Some other students bought exotic food. But Peter didn&apos;t like it. There are two conceivable readings for (1). Either (a) it refers to the party or (b) Peter only disliked the food. Discourse grammars like Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) offer an explanation for this phenomenon. SDRT — an extension of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) — describes a complex propositional structure of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) connected via discourse relations. The hierarchical ordering imposed by relations like narration or elaboration can be used to make predictions about possible attachment sites within the already processed discourse as well as suitable antecedents of anaphora. The next section discusses the question of whether the SDRT formalisation used for discourse structure should also capture the ambiguities, as expressed in (1), for instance, via an underspecified representation.

The hierarchical ordering imposed by relations like narration or elaboration can be used to make predictions about possible attachment sites within the already processed discourse as well as suitable antecedents of anaphora. The next section discusses the question of whether the SDRT formalisation used for discourse structure should also capture the ambiguities, as expressed in (1), for instance, via an underspecified representation. Section 3 introduces a tree logic proposed by Kallmeyer called TDG. Following Schilder (1997), this formalism is employed for the representation of the discourse structure. Section 4 presents the conjoined version of SDRT and TDG. This is a novel combination of the discourse grammar and a tree logic indicating the hierarchical discourse structure. Finally, a USDRT formalisation of the discourse example discussed is given. 2 From DRT to SDRT One obvious shortcoming DRT is that it lacks the rhetorical information that structures the text. This rhetorical information, expressed by discourse relations such as narration or background, has a crucial effect on anaphora resolution, lexical di</context>

Secondly, a topic node is introduced, immediately dominating the discourse segment. No distinction between D-Subordination and D-Freedom has to be made, because the topic is open for further attachment as well. This is the main change to the discourse structure proposed by Schilder (1997). This account encodes the topic information in an additional feature called PROMI. However, it gives no formal definition of this term. I stick therefore to the topic definition Asher gives. But instead a uniform treatment of the hierarchical ordering can be given by the tree logic used. Thirdly, the discourse segment is dominated by the discourse relation that possesses two daughter nodes. The structure is flexible enough to allow further attachment here. No overwriting of a derived structure, as for the SDRT account, is necessary. If a discourse relation is derived, further constraints are </context>
