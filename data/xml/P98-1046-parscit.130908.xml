In this paper we specifically address questions of
polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular
extensions of meaning can be achieved through
the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.
We see verb classes as the key to making gen-
eralizations about regular extensions of mean-
ing. Current approaches to English classifica-
tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita-
tions in their applicability that impede their
utility as general classification schemes. We
present a refinement of Levin classes, intersec-
tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clas-
sification and have more coherent sets of syn-
tactic frames and associated semantic compo-
nents. We have preliminary indications that
the membership of our intersective sets will be
more compatible with WordNet than the orig-
inal Levin classes. We also have begun to ex-
amine related classes in Portuguese, and find
that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent
syntactic and semantic properties.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.979657063829787">
The difficulty of achieving adequate hand-
crafted semantic representations has limited the
field of natural language processing to applica-
tions that can be contained within well-defined
subdomains. The only escape from this lim-
itation will be through the use of automated
or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi-
tion. However, the field has yet to develop a
clear consensus on guidelines for a computa-
tional lexicon that could provide a springboard
for such methods, although attempts are being
made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and San-
filippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

One of the most controversial areas has to do
with polysemy. What constitutes a clear sepa-
ration into senses for any one verb, and how can
these senses be computationally characterized
and distinguished? The answer to this question
is the key to breaking the bottleneck of semantic
representation that is currently the single great-
est limitation on the general application of nat-
ural language processing techniques.
In this paper we specifically address questions
of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how
regular extensions of meaning can be achieved
through the adjunction of particular syntactic
phrases. We base these regular extensions on
a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, inter-
sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic
components associated with specific adjuncts.
We also examine similar classes in Portuguese,
and the predictive powers of alternations in this
language with respect to the same semantic
components. The difficulty of determining a
suitable lexical representation becomes multi-
plied when more than one language is involved
and attempts are made to map between them.
Preliminary investigations have indicated that
a straightforward translation of Levin classes
into other languages is not feasible (Jones et
al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier,
1996). However, we have found interesting par-
allels in how Portuguese and English treat reg-
ular sense extensions.

2 Classifying verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929714285714">
Two current approaches to English verb classi-
fications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and
Levin classes (Levin, 1993). WordNet is an on-
line lexical database of English that currently
contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun,
verb, adjective, and adverb synonyms, each rep-
resenting a lexicalized concept. A synset (syn-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997249">
293
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999634791666667">
onym set) contains, besides all the word forms
that can refer to a given concept, a definitional
gloss and - in most cases - an example sentence.
Words and synsets are interrelated by means
of lexical and semantic-conceptual links, respec-
tively. Antonymy or semantic opposition links
individual words, while the super-/subordinate
relation links entire synsets. WordNet was de-
signed principally as a semantic network, and
contains little syntactic information.
Levin verb classes are based on the ability of
a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntac-
tic frames that are in some sense meaning pre-
serving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
The distribution of syntactic frames in which a
verb can appear determines its class member-
ship. The fundamental assumption is that the
syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the un-
derlying semantics. Levin classes are supposed
to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that
are associated with the individual classes.
The sets of syntactic frames associated with
a particular Levin class are not intended to be
arbitrary, and they are supposed to reflect un-
derlying semantic components that constrain al-
lowable arguments. For example, break verbs
and cut verbs are similar in that they can all
participate in the transitive and in the mid-
dle construction, John broke the window, Glass
breaks easily, John cut the bread, This loaf cuts
easily. However, only break verbs can also occur
in the simple intransitive, The window broke,
*The bread cut. In addition, cut verbs can oc-
cur in the conative, John valiantly cut/hacked
at the frozen loaf, but his knife was too dull to
make a dent in it, whereas break verbs cannot,
*John broke at the window. The explanation
given is that cut describes a series of actions di-
rected at achieving the goal of separating some
object into pieces. It is possible for these ac-
tions to be performed without the end result
being achieved, but where the cutting manner
can still be recognized, i.e., John cut at the loaf.
Where break is concerned, the only thing speci-
fied is the resulting change of state where the
object becomes separated into pieces. If the
result is not achieved, there are no attempted
breaking actions that can still be recognized.

2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906833333334">
It is not clear how much WordNet synsets
should be expected to overlap with Levin
classes, and preliminary indications are that
there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones,
1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Dorr,
1997). However, it would be useful for the
WordNet senses to have access to the detailed
syntactic information that the Levin classes
contain, and it would be equally useful to have
more guidance as to when membership in a
Levin class does in fact indicate shared seman-
tic components. Of course, some Levin classes,
such as braid (bob, braid, brush, clip, coldcream,
comb, condition, crimp, crop, curl, etc.) are
clearly not intended to be synonymous, which
at least partly explains the lack of overlap be-
tween Levin and WordNet.
The association of sets of syntactic frames
with individual verbs in each class is not as
straightforward as one might suppose. For in-
stance, carry verbs are described as not taking
the conative, *The mother carried at the baby,
and yet many of the verbs in the carry class
(push, pull, tug, shove, kick) are also listed in
the push/pull class, which does take the cona-
tive. This listing of a verb in more than one
class (many verbs are in three or even four
classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin.
Does it indicate that more than one sense of
the verb is involved, or is one sense primary,
and the alternations for that class should take
precedence over the alternations for the other
classes in which the verb is listed? The grounds
for deciding that a verb belongs in a particular
class because of the alternations that it does not
take are elusive at best.

3 Intersective Levin classes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999908">
We augmented the existing database of Levin
semantic classes with a set of intersective
classes, which were created by grouping to-
gether subsets of existing classes with over-
lapping members. All subsets were included
which shared a minimum of three members. If
only one or two verbs were shared between two
classes, we assumed this might be due to ho-
mophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual
verbs rather than a systematic relationship in-
volving coherent sets of verbs. This filter al-
lowed us to reject the potential intersective class
that would have resulted from combining the re-
move verbs with the scribble verbs, for example.
The sole member of this intersection is the verb

draw. On the other hand, the scribble verbs
do form an intersective class with the perfor-
mance verbs, since paint and write are also in
both classes, in addition to draw. The algorithm
we used is given in Figure 1.

We then reclassified the verbs in the database
as follows. A verb was assigned membership in
an intersective class if it was listed in each of
the existing classes that were combined to form
the new intersective class. Simultaneously, the
verb was removed from the membership lists of
those existing classes.

3.1 Using intersective Levin classes to
isolate semantic components
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996248682926829">
Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs
that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic
components, and could be divided into smaller
subclasses. The split verbs (cut, draw, kick,
knock, push, rip, roll, shove, slip, split, etc.)
do not obviously form a homogeneous seman-
tic class. Instead, in their use as split verbs,
each verb manifests an extended sense that can
be paraphrased as &amp;quot;separate by V-ing,&amp;quot; where
&amp;quot;V&amp;quot; is the basic meaning of that verb (Levin,
1993). Many of the verbs (e.g., draw, pull, push,
shove, tug, yank) that do not have an inherent
semantic component of &amp;quot;separating&amp;quot; belong to
this class because of the component of force in
their meaning. They are interpretable as verbs
of splitting or separating only in particular syn-
tactic frames (I pulled the twig and the branch
apart, I pulled the twig off (of) the branch, but
not *I pulled the twig and the branch). The ad-
junction of the apart adverb adds a change of
state semantic component with respect to the
object which is not present otherwise. These
fringe split verbs appear in several other inter-
sective classes that highlight the force aspect of
their meaning. Figure 2 depicts the intersection
of split, carry and push/pull.

carry, push/pull and split verbs - verbs in () are
not listed by Levin in all the intersecting classes
but participate in all the alternations
The intersection between the push/pull verbs
of exerting force, the carry verbs and the split
verbs illustrates how the force semantic compo-
nent of a verb can also be used to extend its
meaning so that one can infer a causation of
accompanied motion. Depending on the par-
ticular syntactic frame in which they appear,
members of this intersective class (pull, push,
shove, tug, kick, draw, yank) * can be used to
exemplify any one (or more) of the the compo-
nent Levin classes.

for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to
check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to
check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that de-
fine the class. Since intersective classes were built using
membership lists rather than the set of defining alterna-
tions, they were similarly incomplete. This is an obvious
shortcoming of the current implementation of intersec-
tive classes, and might affect the choice of 3 as a relevance
cut-off in later implementations.

Although the Levin classes that make up an
intersective class may have conflicting alterna-
tions (e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the
conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot),
this does not invalidate the semantic regularity
of the intersective class. As a verb of exerting
force, push can appear in the conative alterna-
tion, which emphasizes its force semantic com-
ponent and ability to express an &amp;quot;attempted&amp;quot;
action where any result that might be associ-
ated with the verb (e.g., motion) is not nec-
essarily achieved; as a carry verb (used with a
goal or directional phrase), push cannot take the
conative alternation, which would conflict with
the core meaning of the carry verb class (i.e.,
causation of motion). The critical point is that,
while the verb&apos;s meaning can be extended to
either &amp;quot;attempted&amp;quot; action or directed motion,
these two extensions cannot co-occur - they are
mutually exclusive. However the simultaneous
potential of mutually exclusive extensions is not
a problem. It is exactly those verbs that are
triple-listed in the split/push/carry intersective
class (which have force exertion as a semantic
component) that can take the conative. The
carry verbs that are not in the intersective class
(carry, drag, haul, heft, hoist, lug, tote, tow) are
more &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; examples of the carry class and
always imply the achievement of causation of
motion. Thus they cannot take the conative al-
ternation.

3.2 Comparisons to WordNet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947421052632">
Even though the Levin verb classes are defined
by their syntactic behavior, many reflect seman-
tic distinctions made by WordNet, a classifica-
tion hierarchy defined in terms of purely se-
mantic word relations (synonyms, hypernyms,
etc.). When examining in detail the intersec-
tive classes just described, which emphasize not
only the individual classes, but also their rela-
tion to other classes, we see a rich semantic lat-
tice much like WordNet. This is exemplified by
the Levin cut verbs and the intersective class
formed by the cut verbs and split verbs. The
original intersective class (cut, hack, hew, saw)
exhibits alternations of both parent classes, and
has been augmented with chip, clip, slash, snip
since these cut verbs also display the syntactic
properties of split verbs.
WordNet distinguishes two subclasses of cut,
differentiated by the type of result:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922568333333333">
1. Manner of cutting that results in separa-
tion into pieces (chip, clip, cut, hack, hew,
saw, slash, snip), having cut, separate with
an instrument as an immediate hypernym.
2. Manner of cutting that doesn&apos;t separate
completely (scrape, scratch), having cut
into, incise as an immediate hypernym,
which in turn has cut, separate with an in-
strument as an immediate hypernym.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964965517241">
This distinction appears in the second-order
Levin classes as membership vs. nonmember-
ship in the intersective class with split. Levin
verb classes are based on an underlying lat-
tice of partial semantic descriptions, which are
manifested indirectly in diathesis alternations.
Whereas high level semantic relations (syn-
onym, hypernym) are represented directly in
WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from
the intersection between Levin verb classes, as
with the cut/split class.
However, other intersective classes, such as
the split/push/carry class, are no more con-
sistent with WordNet than the original Levin
classes. The most specific hypernym common
to all the verbs in this intersective class is move,
displace, which is also a hypernym for other
carry verbs not in the intersection. In addition,
only one verb (pull) has a WordNet sense cor-
responding to the change of state - separation
semantic component associated with the split
class. The fact that the split sense for these
verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet
is not surprising since it is only an extended
sense of the verbs, and separation is inferred
only when the verb occurs with an appropriate
adjunct, such as apart. However, apart can also
be used with other classes of verbs, including
many verbs of motion. To explicitly list separa-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999990214285714">
tion as a possible sense for all these verbs would
be extravagant when this sense can be gener-
ated from the combination of the adjunct with
the force (potential cause of change of physical
state) or motion (itself a special kind of change
of state, i.e., of position) semantic component of
the verb. WordNet does not currently provide
a consistent treatment of regular sense exten-
sion (some are listed as separate senses, others
are not mentioned at all). It would be straight-
forward to augment it with pointers indicating
which senses are basic to a class of verbs and
which can be generated automatically, and in-
clude corresponding syntactic information.

3.3 Sense extension for manner of
motion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999569488372093">
Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two
classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and
roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (me-
ander verbs). Roll and run verbs have seman-
tic components describing a manner of motion
that typically, though not necessarily, involves
change of location. In the absence of a goal or
path adjunct they do not specify any direction
of motion, and in some cases (e.g., float, bounce)
require the adjunct to explicitly specify any dis-
placement at all. The two classes differ in that
roll verbs relate to manners of motion charac-
teristic of inanimate entities, while run verbs
describe manners in which animate entities can
move. Some manner of motion verbs allow a
transitive alternation in addition to the basic in-
transitive. When a roll verb occurs in the tran-
sitive (Bill moved the box across the room), the
subject physically causes the object to move,
whereas the subject of a transitive run verb
merely induces the object to move (the coach
ran the athlete around the track). Some verbs
can be used to describe motion of both animate
and inanimate objects, and thus appear in both
roll and run verb classes. The slide class parti-
tions this roll/run intersection into verbs that
can take the transitive alternation and verbs
that cannot (drift and glide cannot be causative,
because they are not typically externally con-
trollable). Verbs in the slide/roll/run intersec-
tion are also allowed to appear in the dative
alternation (Carla slid the book to Dale, Carla
slid Dale the book), in which the sense of change
of location is extended to change of possession.
When used intransitively with a path prepo-
sitional phrase, some of the manner of motion
verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional
existence, in which the subject does not actu-
ally move, but has a shape that could describe
a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists
through the valley). These verbs are listed in
the intersective classes with meander verbs of
existence.

The Portuguese verbs we examined behaved
much more similarly to their English counter-
parts than we expected. Many of the verbs
participate in alternations that are direct trans-
lations of the English alternations. However,
there are some interesting differences in which
sense extensions are allowed.

We have made a preliminary study of the Por-
tuguese translation of the carry verb class. As in
English, these verbs seem to take different alter-
nations, and the ability of each to participate in
an alternation is related to its semantic content.
Table 1 shows how these Portuguese verbs natu-
rally cluster into two different subclasses, based
on their ability to take the conative and apart
alternations as well as path prepositions. These
subclasses correspond very well to the English
subclasses created by the intersective class.
The conative alternation in Portuguese is
mainly contra (against), and the apart alterna-
tion is mainly separando (separating). For ex-

4.2 Changing class membership
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999704780487805">
We also investigated the Portuguese translation
of some intersective classes of motion verbs. We
selected the slide/roll/run, meander/roll and
roll/run intersective classes. Most verbs have
more than one translation into Portuguese, so
we chose the translation that best described the
meaning or that had the same type of arguments
as described in Levin&apos;s verb classes.
The elements of the slide/roll/run class are
rebater (bounce), flutuar (float), rolar (roll) and
deslizar (slide). The resultative in Portuguese
cannot be expressed in the same way as in En-
glish. It takes a gerund plus a reflexive, as in A
porta deslizou abrindo-se (The door slid opening
itself). Transitivity is also not always preserved
in the translations. For example, flutuar does
not take a direct object, so some of the alterna-
tions that are related to its transitive meaning
are not present. For these verbs, we have the in-
duced action alternation by using the light verb
fazer (make) before the verb, as in Maria fez o
barco flutuar (Mary floated the boat).
As can be seen in Table 2 the alternations for
the Portuguese translations of the verbs in this
intersective class indicate that they share simi-
lar properties with the English verbs, including
the causative/inchoative. The exception to this,
as just noted, is flutuar (float). The result of
this is that flutuar should move out of the slide
class, which puts it with derivar (drift) and pla-
nar (glide) in the closely related roll/run class.
As in English, derivar and planar are not exter-
nally controllable actions and thus don&apos;t take
the causative/inchoative alternation common to
other verbs in the roll class. Planar doesn&apos;t take
a direct object in Portuguese, and it shows the
induced action alternation the same way as flu-
tuar (by using the light verb fazer). Derivar is
usually said as &amp;quot;estar a deriva&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;to be adrift&amp;quot;),
showing its non-controllable action more explic-
itly.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997381769230769">
We have presented a refinement of Levin classes,
intersective classes, and discussed the potential
for mapping them to WordNet senses. Whereas
each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized accord-
ing to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of
cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may
share many different semantic features, without
designating one as primary. Intersective Levin
sets partition these classes according to more co-
herent subsets of features (force, force+motion,
force+ separation), in effect highlighting a lattice
of semantic features that determine the sense of
a verb. Given the incompleteness of the list of
members of Levin classes, each verb must be
examined to see whether it exhibits all the al-
ternations of a class. This might be approxi-
mated by automatically extracting the syntac-
tic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus
data, rather than manual analysis of each verb,
as was done in this study.
We have also examined a mapping between
the English verbs that we have discussed and
their Portuguese translations, which have sev-
eral of the same properties as the corresponding
verbs in English. Most of these verbs take the
same alternations as in English and, by virtue
of these alternations, achieve the same regular
sense extensions.
There are still many questions that require
further investigation. First, since our experi-
ment was based on a translation from English
to Portuguese, we can expect that other verbs in
Portuguese would share the same alternations,
so the classes in Portuguese should by no means
be considered complete. We will be using re-
sources such as dictionaries and on-line corpora
to investigate potential additional members of
our classes. Second, since the translation map-
pings may often be many-to-many, the alterna-

tions may depend on which translation is cho-
sen, potentially giving us different clusters, but
it is uncertain to what extent this is a factor,
and it also requires further investigation. In
this experiment, we have tried to choose the
Portuguese verb that is most closely related to
the description of the English verb in the Levin
class.
We expect these cross-linguistic features to be
useful for capturing translation generalizations
between languages as discussed in the litera-
ture (Palmer and Rosenzweig, 1996), (Copes-
take and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Dorr, 1997). In
pursuing this goal, we are currently implement-
ing features for motion verbs in the English
Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al.,
1998). TAGs have also been applied to Por-
tuguese in previous work, resulting in a small
Portuguese grammar (Kipper, 1994). We in-
tend to extend this grammar, building a more
robust TAG grammar for Portuguese, that will
allow us to build an English/Portuguese trans-
fer lexicon using these features.

<abstract confidence="0.9996735">In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. We see verb classes as the key to making generalizations about regular extensions of meaning. Current approaches to English classification, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitations in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersective sets, which are a more fine-grained classification and have more coherent sets of syntactic frames and associated semantic components. We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the original Levin classes. We also have begun to examine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.</abstract>

The split verbs (cut, draw, kick, knock, push, rip, roll, shove, slip, split, etc.) do not obviously form a homogeneous semantic class. Instead, in their use as split verbs, each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as &amp;quot;separate by V-ing,&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; is the basic meaning of that verb (Levin, 1993). Many of the verbs (e.g., draw, pull, push, shove, tug, yank) that do not have an inherent semantic component of &amp;quot;separating&amp;quot; belong to this class because of the component of force in their meaning. They are interpretable as verbs of splitting or separating only in particular syntactic frames (I pulled the twig and the branch apart, I pulled the twig off (of) the branch, but not *I pulled the twig and the branch). The adjunction of the apart adverb adds a change of state semantic component with respect to the object which is not present otherwise. These fringe split verbs appear in several ot</context>

We also examine similar classes in Portuguese, and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components. The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multiplied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them. Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996). However, we have found interesting parallels in how Portuguese and English treat regular sense extensions. 2 Classifying verbs Two current approaches to English verb classifications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993). WordNet is an online lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun, verb, adjective, and adverb synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. A synset (syn293 onym set) contains, besides all the word forms that can refer to a given concept, a definitional gloss and - in most cases - an example sentence</context>
