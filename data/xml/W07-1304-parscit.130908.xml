This present work deliberately abandons
the purpose of capturing the global
resemblance between languages and the
ambition of giving a rational foundation to
probability of changes in linguistics, to
focus instead on cladistic approach, which
was applied to different dialects and data
(gallo-romance, southern italo-romance)
through an original coding of philological
derivations. Results show good congruence
with linguistic classification and provide
new insight on how tackle various

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949191489362">
In the last decades, theoretical developments in the
field of the biological evolution of species and
populations have been combined with increasing
computer facilities, which are likely to change the
practice of phylogeny reconstruction drastically.
Attempts to shift such a practice in order to
reconstruct the evolution of language have been
proposed, since the middle of the 20th century, as
evidenced by several publications that display the
whole range of methodologies. One of these
approaches, called Numerical Taxonomy, consists
in estimating some linguistic distances between
pairs of languages, from which evolutionary trees
or networks are inferred to produce some linguistic
classifications. This approach is classically used in
dialectometry. (Evrard, 1964; Goebl, 1981, 1987,
Scapoli et al., 2005, Ben Hamed, 2005). A more
recent approach, based on Bayesian principles,
suggests to attach some probabilities to each
linguistic change (Gray et al, 2003), looking for the
most likely tree, given the model and the observed
data. Finally, the last kind of approach, inherited
from XIXth century linguists, is the cladistic
approach, as formalized by Hennig (1950) and
clearly advocated by some linguists, although
using various methodologies (Hoenigswald and
Wiener, 1987; Wang, 1988; Holden, 2001; Ringe
et al., 2002; Rexova et al., 2003; Nakhleh et al.,
2005; Ben Hamed et al., 2005).
The present work is focusing on cladistics,
abandoning the purpose of capturing the global
resemblance between languages and the ambition
of giving a rational foundation to probability of
linguistic changes, adopting instead a strategy
enabling us to integrate linguistic hypotheses
before drawing inference on the evolution of
linguistic traits and languages, and possibly to
refute them. To check the heuristic value of this
methodology, we endeavour to apply cladistics to
dialectal data from different sources, hoping to
bring forward and discuss some arguments on their
diversification in space and time. As far as we
know, cladistic is more often applied to language
families than to dialect areas, so that our research
is pioneering the field, raising the controversial
question concerning the best representation of
dialectal diversity: tree-like and/or networks.

In this case, 21 localities were sampled for this

corpora, diachronic trees were created using the
existing bibliography (Chauveau, 1989; Pignon,
1960). But we must reckon and point out that we
had a very hard time in trying to make sense out of
contradictory or underspecified accounts on chains
of phonetic changes available in the literature. We
found out – to our bewilderment – that most
phonetic changes are quite often telescoped in
handbooks of Romance dialectology, monographs,
and Ph.D. dissertations, giving only the first and
the last stage of phonetic changes: *A &gt; D, instead
of *A &gt; *B &gt; *C &gt; D. We therefore had to rely on
principles of areologic continuity, as the process of
stepping is made hazardous by the vacuum on the
successive stages of the sound changes in the
literature, in particular in the peripheral varieties of
oïl (except in Chauveau’s monographs on western
Oïl dialects). These principles are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996891608695653">
Pr.1. Principle of areologic continuity: implies a
gradual theory of linguistic change whose stages
can be reconstructed on the basis of areal
configurations. It entails that stages *B and *C of a
*A &gt; D change are available on the maps in current
dialects not far from a contiguous centre of gravity.
For instance, in western oïl dialects, *e &gt; oi goes
through a *e &gt; ei &gt; ai &gt; oi vowel shift whose *ai
phase is still to be seen on the ALF maps in the
neighbourhood, but it is not akin with the far
distant *e &gt; oi change in the East (in Romance
lorrain), where the chain *e &gt; ei &gt;oi does not entail
an *ai phase.
Pr.2. Principle of parsimony: it claims that the
vocalic system develops with parsimony the
strategies of change; not more than two or three
major structural options from which the later
evolutions unfold.
Pr.3. Principle of unitarianism and naturalness:
dialectal idiosyncrasies should be rare upstream
and abundant downstream. In other words, change
is strongly constrained typologically closer to the
root of the stepping tree, and gets more and more

free at the end of the branches. One should be
cautious with the intricate complexity of
explanations found in monographs and handbooks
on idiosyncrasy of changes in local dialects. More
simply, one could state that changes are
constrained according to UG (Universal Grammar)
principles on the first hand, and specified by local,
language or dialect-specific parameters on the
second hand.
3.2. Cladistic procedure. In order to apply
cladistic procedure to linguistic data, one has first
to find a way to code the trees of philological
derivations through a coding procedure which
takes into account all the hypotheses assumed by
the linguists. In a second step, the field
observations have to be coded, and, finally, tree
building algorithms are implemented to meet
optimal criteria, i.e. parsimony in this context.
However, within the framework of this necessarily
short paper, we will only discuss tree structure,
tackling briefly the feasible reconstruction of
ancestral state at nodes, but keeping detailed
development for further presentation.

3.2.1 Character coding
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99848836">
Figure 1a shows how the relationships between
vocalic variations of a given word (“Père”, as an
example) are coded. Each variant takes the value 0
or 1 depending on its place within the tree
derivation. First, a matrix is built (figure 1b),
where rows stand for the coding of the variants,
whereas columns hold for the transformations from
a plesiomorphic variant (the initial diachronic
state, or etymon) to an apomorphic one (the
terminal state, or synchronic reflexes). For
example, the inferred variant, *aé (lettered A),
derived from the late latin variant of the A[ 2
variable, is coded by the vector [0000000], being
the ancestral variant, while its derived reflexes are
all coded 1, in the first column. Likewise, the
apomorphic variant é:é (lettered F) is coded by the
vector [1001100], the first 1 indicates that this
variant is derived from the é variant (B), and the
fourth and fifth 1 indicate that it is also derived
successively from –é– to –à:é– (B−&gt;E) and from –
à:é– to – é:é– (E−&gt;F).
2 A[ reads as classical latin low vowel in open syllable
as in PA-TREM, MA-REM (noted &lt; [ &gt;, whereas &lt; ] &gt;
stands for a closed syllabe as in –AR- : AR-CUM, AR-
TEM).

Since the transformations can be estimated to be
more or less current in term of phonological
naturalness, they can be weighed by giving heavy
weights for natural or rare transformations and
light weights for easy transformations. In this
work, character weight was ranged on a scale
between 1 and 5 (e.g. w [423433], figure 1).
Lastly, since the transformations are polarized,
meaning that we hypothesize the absence of
backward changes, we allocate an infinite weight
for reversal transformation (i.e. no reversion
allowed). This kind of coding is routinely used by
phylogeneticists (see PHYLIP or PAUP software).

Once the character coding step is performed for
all the words investigated (23 different words for
the Oïl data (ALF), 20 for SIR (ALI)), each area or
dialect is coded according to the previous coding.
In the example of the Oïl investigation, data were
collected for 45 geographical different areas
(figure 2), each of them having its own way to
pronounce each of the 23 words of the sample. For
example (Table 2), the row « 16Bourg 3» has the
variant C for the first word (“Père”) described on
the first column. This means that this area as well
as the area numbered 45, 59, 65, and 143 share the
same derived variant: –é– (labelled C, figure 1),
while the rows labelled 108 and 153 share the –è:–
reflex variant (B), variants that they inherited
either from some common ancestor or because of
geographical proximity.

previous step (character coding). For instance the
letter C, column 1 (figure 2) is replaced by the
vector [1100000], the letter B by [1000000]. The
tree building reconstruction is carried out from this
final matrix which sums up all the linguistic
hypotheses (tree of philological derivation, polarity
of changes, weighting, and geographic variants).

4.1. In the Oïl dialects tree (figures 2 and 3), the
central varieties appear as a clade (C1, from

the Paris basin and those of the mid-west plains,
and includes peripheral spots, like Noirmoutier
(478) or Saintongeais (518Saintonge). This major

the Romance Lorraine 4 dialects. In addition to
these great divisions between Central-Western oïl
and Peripheric Eastern oïl, which is fairly
consistent with current classifications of oïl
dialects (Goebl, 1984, 2002), the advantage of this
tree lies in the consistency of the inner structures
of the major or intermediate clades.

4.2. Concerning the Southern Italo-Romance
(SIR), from Naples to Sicily and Sardinia, the
congruence between the cladistic tree (figure 4)
and the philological classifications is satisfactory
(Goebl, 1984; Grassi et al., 1997), and most of
novelties lay in the inner structures of the tree. The
phylogram of the SIR shows three major divisions
(figure 4): two peripheries, the first one gathering
Sardinian Central-Southerner varieties (786 and
748) and the southernmost apulien (818) (red
cluster), and the second one (fuchsia) grouping the
central-northern apulian (846,828)) as an external
branch with the southernmost basilian and central
salentino (868 and 917) This last branch is
connected to an inner group which separates the
branch from Sicilian-Sardinian-Salentino (in blue)
from the campano-calabro-basilian (green and
yellow). A most interesting detail is the place of
818Apul, a Gallo-Romance francoprovençal
dialect settled in two villages (Faeto and Celle) San
Vito by the Angevine dynasty in Northern Apulia
during the 13th century. This dialect, previously

spoken in the Ain and Isère departments in France,
got into close, symbiotic contact with Apulian, a
dialect of the SIR type. The cladistic procedure
grasped accurately its allogenic structure,
clustering it in the upper branch, along with
Sardinian – also a distinct language as compared to
SIR- which should therefore considered as a
“foreign languages branch” rather than a peripheric
node of the SIR continuum.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993189189189">
The cladistic approach developed here provides a
convenient way to integrate and test various
hypotheses concerning the linguistic changes.
Particularly, the rare or relative absence of
backmutation in phonological characters is
correctly taken into account by forbidden reverse
changes, and complex relationships between states
of traits are easily handled, unlike most of the other
methods (as network approaches). The parsimony
criterion consists to optimise the tree in minimising
parallelism. The residual inferred parallelisms
could clearly be visualized simply by looking at
the places they occur along the tree (as exemplified
figure 3). A way to circumvent the parallelism
problem, when several parsimonious trees are
found, would be using a successive weighting
process which looks for parsimonious trees by
assigning to each trait a weight inversely
proportional to its degree of homoplasy (only
parallelism in our case since reversion are not
allowed) (Farris 1969). No such a process was
necessary with our dataset since only one
parsimonious tree was found. However, the
robustness of the parsimonious tree remains
difficult to evaluate, as long as only few words are
integrated in our dataset (only 23 and 20 for Oil
and SIR data respectively), particularly to
appropriately implement resampling procedures
(bootstrap or jackknife).
At this stage of interpretation, one cannot
differentiate between parallel development and
borrowing, unless some a priori are introduced to
do so. In our data set, parallelisms are frequent
(leading to a weak CI) although our two
parsimonious trees are unique and well resolved
(actually, there is no simple relation between CI
and tree resolution) preventing us using various

neighbornet method which is based on global
resemblance and is in any way cladistic). These
approaches are not able, as far as we know, to
handle large amount of polarized changes and
complex weighted multistate relationships. On the
other hand, our strategy turns out to be quite
different from the one proposed by Nakhelh et al
(2006) which first apply compatibility method to
select the best traits allowing to retain few trees
considered as “almost perfect phylogenies”
(missing the phylogenetic information brought by
the other traits), and then to parsimoniously handle
the remaining traits as possible edges representing
borrowing, (but not giving the possibility of
modifying the tree structure accordingly). An
additional advantage (only lightly evoked in this
paper) of the cladistic approach is to allow
inferring changes of the traits along the tree,
suggesting some linguistic scenarios, as correlated
changes, borrowings ...

<bodyText confidence="0.999971136363637">
We shall conclude this pioneering cladistic survey
of phyla and dialect networks pointing out at three
main assets of our data processing : i) unlike most
of current and past research in taxonomy applied to
linguistic data, we tried to do much more than
merely computing distance and similarity between
lists of lexical cognates with a binary procedure:
we processed data according to geolinguistic
analysis, using area linguistic procedures and
phonological markedness theory in endowing
weight to reflexes, ii) our results are mainly
congruent and consistent with current
classification, but intricate patterns in the inner
structures of cladistic nodes also challenging these
classifications, iii) In spite of the small number of
words presently studied here, but thanks to
accurate data and proper sampling from the ALF
and ALI database, it turns out that, by applying
cladistics, for long advocated by linguists, one can
obtain consistent, reliable (and possibly refutable)
results. This is not always the case in the
processing of fuzzy data and mere lists of words.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995085">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897">
Linguists and cladisticians should therefore be
cautious about word-lists, and should as well rely
on linguistic atlases, which provide the widest
array of sampling, and high quality data gathered
through fieldwork by highly trained professionals.
In other words, to put it straightforwardly, well
managed empiricism is a sine qua non condition
for reliable results in quantitative linguistics,
especially as far as cladistics is concerned, due to
the powerfulness of the procedure.

But we must reckon and point out that we had a very hard time in trying to make sense out of contradictory or underspecified accounts on chains of phonetic changes available in the literature. We found out – to our bewilderment – that most phonetic changes are quite often telescoped in handbooks of Romance dialectology, monographs, and Ph.D. dissertations, giving only the first and the last stage of phonetic changes: *A &gt; D, instead of *A &gt; *B &gt; *C &gt; D.

Attempts to shift such a practice in order to reconstruct the evolution of language have been proposed, since the middle of the 20th century, as evidenced by several publications that display the whole range of methodologies. One of these approaches, called Numerical Taxonomy, consists in estimating some linguistic distances between pairs of languages, from which evolutionary trees or networks are inferred to produce some linguistic classifications. This approach is classically used in dialectometry. (Evrard, 1964; Goebl, 1981, 1987, Scapoli et al., 2005, Ben Hamed, 2005).

The parsimony criterion consists to optimise the tree in minimising parallelism. The residual inferred parallelisms could clearly be visualized simply by looking at the places they occur along the tree (as exemplified figure 3). A way to circumvent the parallelism problem, when several parsimonious trees are found, would be using a successive weighting process which looks for parsimonious trees by assigning to each trait a weight inversely proportional to its degree of homoplasy (only parallelism in our case since reversion are not allowed) (Farris 1969). No such a process was necessary with our dataset since only one parsimonious tree was found. However, the robustness of the parsimonious tree remains difficult to evaluate, as long as only few words are integrated in our dataset (only 23 and 20 for Oil and SIR data respectively), particularly to appropriately implement resampling procedures (bootstrap or jackknife). At this stage of interpretation, one cannot differentiate between parallel development and borrowing, unless some a priori are introduced to do so. In our data set, parallelisms are frequent (leading to a weak CI) although our tw</context>

The phylogram of the SIR shows three major divisions (figure 4): two peripheries, the first one gathering Sardinian Central-Southerner varieties (786 and 748) and the southernmost apulien (818) (red cluster), and the second one (fuchsia) grouping the central-northern apulian (846,828)) as an external branch with the southernmost basilian and central salentino (868 and 917) This last branch is connected to an inner group which separates the branch from Sicilian-Sardinian-Salentino (in blue) from the campano-calabro-basilian (green</context>

But we must reckon and point out that we had a very hard time in trying to make sense out of contradictory or underspecified accounts on chains of phonetic changes available in the literature. We found out – to our bewilderment – that most phonetic changes are quite often telescoped in handbooks of Romance dialectology, monographs, and Ph.D. dissertations, giving only the first and the last stage of phonetic changes: *A &gt; D, instead of *A &gt; *B &gt; *C &gt; D.

For instance the letter C, column 1 (figure 2) is replaced by the vector [1100000], the letter B by [1000000]. The tree building reconstruction is carried out from this final matrix which sums up all the linguistic hypotheses (tree of philological derivation, polarity of changes, weighting, and geographic variants). Factorisation are performed with FACTOR software (Felsenstein, 2004), parsimonious trees being obtained with PAUP* (v4.0) (Swofford, 2002), using TBR (tree-bisection-reconnection), random agglomeration option (100), holding 6 best trees at each steps. Tree length, consistency index and retention index are also estimated. The most parsimonious trees are then plotted figures 3 and 4. An example of inferred parallelism is also shown on figure 3.
