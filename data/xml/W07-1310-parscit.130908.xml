With the supply of 8 closely interpreted
dialectometrical maps, this paper analyses
the linguistic change of the geolinguistic
deep structures in Northern France (Do-
maine d’Oïl) between 1300 and 1900. As a
matter of fact, the result will show – with
one exception – the great stability of these
deep structures.

Through the comparison of two data sets of 1300
and of 1900, the present contribution discusses, if
and in which way the basic geolinguistic structure
of Northern France (Domaine d’Oïl) changed in
the course of this period. In this investigation, a
number of different methods of dialectometry
(DM) will be applied. DM is a subdiscipline of
quantitative linguistics which concentrates on the
exploration of the actual deep geolinguistic structu-
res of a given space, using as data source linguistic
atlases or similarly structured data collections
(consisting of N inquiry points and p atlas or wor-
king maps). Of course, it has to be assumed that
these deep structures were generated by a genuine
specific activity of man (i.e of of the homo lo-
quens), that is to say: the « linguistic (or dialectal)
management of space by the homo loquens ». Inso-
far as man has obviously many other opportunities
of managing a given natural space besides the lin-
guistic management, there result many opportuni-
ties for interdisciplinary cooperation with DM.
The Salzburg-based DM (Goebl 2006a) pursues
the genuine principles of traditional (Romance)
linguistic geography with quantitative means. It
therefore defines its main aim in the empowering
of the diagnostic virtue of traditional linguistic
geography by introducing global or synthetic
(quantitative) methods.

2.1 Corpus 1300 (drawn from Dees 1980)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996365">
The medieval corpus was borrowed from the scrip-
ta-atlas (1980) of the Amsterdam Romance linguist
A. Dees. This atlas is based on the comprehensive
interpretation of 3300 original charters of Northern
France of the second half of the 13th century,
which were analysed in that instance according to a
list of ca. 300 written (or scripta-) attributes. These
scripta-attributes are mainly of phonetic relevance,
most of them referring to vocalism (189 attributes),
but also to consonantism (87 attributes), and some
of them even to morphology (22 attributes). As a
result, the data matrix holds 298 attributes and 85
« inquiry points ». The latter correspond actually to
scripta-centres (scriptoria, chanceries) which are
distributed as evenly as possible all over the Do-
maine d’Oïl. For the measuring of the graphic va-
riation in the 3300 charters, A. Dees developped a
specific method. As a result, he was able to deter-
mine – for each single attribute – its relative occur-
rence (in percentage) in the charters of the 85

scripta-centres. The content of the data matrix lies
therefore on a metrical scale.
In the ninetees, A. Dees and his collaborator Piet
von Reenen handed me over this data matrix, as a
basis which allowed me to realize many dialecto-
metrical experiments. Its only disadvantage is that
the machine-readable matrix holds less attributes
(268) than the printed atlas (298). Nevertheless, by
applying the « Average Euclidean Metric »
(AEM), the « Average Manhattan Metric » (AMM)
and the « Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficent »
[r(BP)], the dialectometrical results are very profi-
table (see Goebl 2006b). The scripta-atlas publis-
hed by Dees in 1980 shows quantitative visualisa-
tions of the spatial distribution of the 298 attribu-
tes, but does not encompass global data interpreta-
tion with dialectometrical (or similar) methods.

2.1.1 The Dees-data: one illustrative example
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968696969697">
In his scripta-atlas (1980: carte 87, p. 93), A. Dees
also investigated the regional variation in the spel-
ling of the French possessive pronoun: leur, leurs,
leurz etc. which are all derived from the Latin ety-
mon ILLÓRU. Most probably they were created
under the influence of a specific regional dialect
pronunciation. At the end of the 13th century, the
geographic contrast between these eu-spellings and
the older equivalent forms lor, lors, lors etc. was
quite sharp in the Domaine d’Oïl. Hence, Dees
checked the number of all occurrences of eu-
spellings (belonging to the possessive pronoun) in
the 3300 above mentioned charters and listed, for
each of the 85 scripta-centres of his atlas, the per-
centages of those charters which show at least one
occurence of the spelling -eu-. As a result, 81 out
of the 93 charters of the scripta-region 26
« Somme, Pas-de-Calais » (located in the medieval
Artois: see the top of the figures 1, 3, 5 and 7)
showed a considerable amount of eu-spellings, un-
like the remaining 12 charters. In the 105 charters
of the scripta-region 1 « Charente, Charente-
Maritime » (South-western corner of the Domaine
d’Oïl), no occurrences of the eu-spellings were
found. Obviously, the different spellings of the
possessive pronoun in that region were still on -o-.
Thus, Dees registered the value 87% (= 81 : 93) for
the scripta-region 26 in the North and the value 0%
for the scripta-region 1 in the South-west.
As Dees analysed 298 scripta-features in the same
way, he succeeded in covering the whole range of
the stressed and unstressed vocalism and conso-
nantism of Old French.

2.2 Corpus 1900 (drawn from ALF)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967392857143">
The second corpus, referring to 1900, was drawn
from the data of the French linguistic atlas ALF,
precisely: from a data matrix which had been esta-
blished in the process of dialectometrization of the
total ALF grid. The dimensions of this data matrix
are: N = 641 inquiry points (distributed all over
France), p = 1687 working maps, 1117 referring to
phonetics (612 to vocalism, and 505 to consonan-
tism), 417 referring to vocabulary, and 99 to mor-
phology. 347 inquiry points (out of the 641 points
on the total ALF grid) are located in Northern
France : they represent therefore the Domaine
d’Oïl. Among these 347 inquiry points, 85 points
were selected in geographic correspondance to the
85 scripta-centres of the Dees-atlas, and subse-
quently reunited to a new grid (see the right halves
of Maps 1-8).
Among the 1687 workings maps mentioned above,
we took only into consideration those of phonetic
relevance, thus: 1117 maps. They derived from
247 original maps of the ALF by phonetic typiza-
tion, which is a common procedure in Romance
linguistics. The units of this ALF data matrix are
upon the nominal scale. With the supply of the
« Weighted Identity Value (with the weight 1) »
[WIV (1)], the dialectometrical interpretation of
this data matrix proved to be very successful (see
Goebl 1984, I: 83-86, and 2006a: 418-419).

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.783606">
2.2.1 The ALF-data : two illustrative examples
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990125">
An example for two characteristic phonetic featu-
res is given in Map 812 of the ALF le marché « the
market ». The 85 occurrences in the Domaine
d’Oïl all derive from the Latin etymon MERCÁ-
TU. The different dialectal followers of the
stressed Á which is considered in this instance
show the following results: a) pronunciation with -i
(19 ALF-points), b) with (closed) -é (60 ALF-
points), c) with (open) -è (1 ALF-point), d) with -ö
(4 ALF-points), e) with (neutral) -e (1 ALF-point).
From the metrological point of view, these five
phonetic types represent what is called « (nominal)

multistate characters ». As the corresponding wor-
king map contains five different (phonetic) types
(or &lt; taxates » in Salzburg terminology), it is called
as well a &lt; 5-nymic working map ».
Nevertheless, the data of the same ALF-map can
also be analysed according to consonantal princi-
ples, which is realized by listing the dialectal re-
sults of the postconsonantal C before stressed Á in
MERCÁTU. The results are as follows: a) š (72
ALF-points), b) šy (2), c) ts (1), d) tšy (3), e) k (2),
f) tš (3), g) ky (1), h) ty (1). On the map, these eight
consonantal types show a geographic distribution
which is far from being similar to the former one
of the five vocalic types. Actually, this experience
is also valid for the great majority of our ALF-
working maps.
The reduced data matrix drawn from the integral
ALF-grid (with 1687 working maps) consists of
914 working maps: it starts with 2-nymic maps and
has up to 23-nymic maps, embracing a total of
4263 phonetic types or &lt; taxates ».

3 Establishement of the dialectometrical
maps
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971405405405">
DM is a map-based discipline: It visualises sys-
tematically all its results by using previously de-
fined cartographic standards and by a very hand-
some computer program called VDM (&lt; Visual
DialectoMetry »), which supports and resets these
visualisations perfectly. With VDM, choropleth
maps and isarithmic maps, as well as trees can be
generated. The results are always mapped in col-
ours that are ranged according to the solar (or rain-
bow) spectrum, the warm colours lying above the
arithmetic means of the respective frequency dis-
tribution, and the cold colours below it. The trees
are all &lt; spatialized » in principle, which means
that their structural information is projected di-
rectly from the tree on the map.
The comparison between the medieval versus the
modern data occurs basically in visual form, a me-
thodically correct procedure, as the two corre-
sponding iconic patterns are established according
to the same cartographic norms. Further, the re-
spective frequency distributions may also be corre-
lated in order to gain a correlation map. For rea-
sons of space, this procedure will not be demon-
strated in this paper.
All the maps shown in section 4 are taken from
two square similarity matrices (N x N) consisting
of 85 items (N = 85), calculated by means of spe-
cial similarity indexes – AEM and WIV(1) – on
the basis of two data matrices (N = 85 ; p1300 = 268
metrical attributes, p1900 = 1117 nominal attrib-
utes). Hence, this demonstration includes two simi-
larity maps, two parameter maps, two interpoint
maps and two trees (with the respective spatializa-
tions). These four comparison planes are actually
of special relevance, by allowing a global compari-
son which is also precise to the last detail of the
medieval versus the modern data.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972519">
4.1 Comparison plane 1 : two similarity maps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914413793103">
The most important instrument of DM is the simi-
larity map. Each similarity map consists of a refer-
ence point and N-1 similarity values distributed in
space, which values decrease proportionally with
their geographical distance from the reference
point. The geographic pattern of the progressive
drop of these measurement values is clearly shown
with the cartographic means of DM. In Maps 1 and
2, the reference point is located in the Poitou
(South-west). The visual comparison of the two
choropleth profiles shows their great similarity.
The same effect occurs also from the remaining 84
reference points. This means that the linguistic
management of the Domaine d’Oïl was very simi-
lar in the Middle Ages (through the linguistic ac-
tivity of the scribes) and in modern times (through
the linguistic activity of the dialect speakers). It
must be added that, generally speaking, medieval
non-Latin charters of the 13th and the 14th centu-
ries (mainly) had a strong dialectal colouring, a
phenomenon which was noted not in France only,
they showed therefore a great number of local
and/or regional written attributes. In the 19th cen-
tury already, it was assumed that this graph(et)ic
variation was generated or at least partly caused by
the oral variation of the different medieval dialects.
In Northern France, this regional colouring of the
charters decreases rapidly after ca. 1400, and van-
ishes after 1450.

4.2 Comparison plane 2 : two parameter-
maps : synopsis of the skewness values
Maps 3 and 4 reveal an entirely different question.
The synopsis (or combination) of the N skewness
values of a given similarity matrix indicates the
degree of variation between different regions in
regard to the so-called &lt; linguistic compromise or
exchange ». This phenomenon is defined as the
degree of the intermixing of geolinguistic attributes
with (respectively) regionally varying extension
and/or intensity. Our DM-classification distinguis-
hes therefore zones of high linguistic compromise
(here : clear shadings) and zones of weak linguistic
compromise (here : dark shadings). Where this lin-
guistic exchange is high or great, a strong linguis-
tic intermixing is prevailing. Where it is weak, the
linguistic interaction is also low: these areas went
on keeping a strong linguistic autonomy and were
not yet seized by the general intermixing.
In Map 3 (left), the zones of high linguistic com-
promise or exchange form a kind of cross: they are
located in the centre of the Domaine d’Oïl, whe-
reas on its peripherical boarders the areas of diffe-
rent historical provinces (such as: Normandy, Pi-
cardy, Lorraine, etc.) are found. In Map 4 (right),
the clear shaded zone occupies now the main part
of the grid of the Domaine d’Oïl: in comparison
with the left map it has virtually &lt; exploded » (note
the black circle), as a consequence of the conti-
nuous expansion of the language type of the Ile-de-
France, which had been strongly supported by the
French kings and after 1789 also by the Republic.
Only on the Eastern peripherical boarders, some
provinces (Picardy, the Walloons, Lorraine, etc.)
could elude the general language compromise and
thus the general linguistic intermixing.
Both maps consist of respectively 85 skewness
values which were gained by respectively 85 simi-
larity distributions. Since almost 20 years, it is
well-known that the skewness value is an excellent
instrument for measuring language compromise or
exchange; in many instances, evidence of this fact
has been given with different data sets (see Goebl
1984, I: 150-153, and 2006a: 419-420).
4.3 Comparison plane 3 : two interpoint or
honeycomb maps
Actually, Maps 5 and 6 represent two honeycomb
maps, each of them consisting of 225 polygon si-
des which vary according to thickness and dark-
ness. Every one of these polygon sides lies bet-
ween (= inter) contiguous inquiry points (hence the
name interpoint map), and indicates virtually the
relative dialectal differences. Instead of the linguis-
tic similarities (sim), the potential linguistic diffe-
rences or distances (dist) were mapped. In quanti-
tative regard, they are interrelated according to the
formula: dist + sim = 100. Thus, the distance re-
lated counterpart of the above mentioned similarity
index WIV(1) is the WDV (1) (&lt; Weighted Dis-
tance Value (with the weight 1)) ».
The cartographic message of the two maps largely
corresponds to the evidence of the traditional iso-
gloss syntheses which were commonly established
during the 20th century in Romance, German and
English linguistics. The thick (and dark) polygon
sides represent the so called &lt; linguistic bounda-
ries», a linguistic term which is rather colloquial
and imprecise. One clearly recognizes that in Map
5 (left) in the North (Picardy) and the South-west
(Poitou, Saintonge) there are very prominent and
distinct &lt; boundaries ». But it also shows very
clearly in Map 6 (right) that in the period between
1300 and 1900 these &lt; boundaries » were moved to
the North (and East) as well as to the utmost bor-
ders of the South by an &lt; invisible force » and that
a zone with only very weak interpunctual demarca-
tions emerged in the middle of the Domaine d’Oïl.
Our knowledge of the history of the French lan-
guage allows us to identify this &lt; invisible force »:
it is the irradiation of the linguistic type of the Ile-
de-France, pushed by the politics.

Moreover, the two similarity matrices can first be
processed by dendrographic methods, in a next
step, the two trees are compared. In this procedure,
one has to pay attention to those bifurcations of the
tree which are located near the trunk (or the root).
Among the relevant &lt; hierarchic agglomerative
methods » applied for the generation of trees,
Ward’s method has proved to be most appropriate.
In Maps 7 and 8, the tree and the map were drawn
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989394">

<bodyText confidence="0.999979052631579">
and visualised, isolating thereby (respectively)
three distinct cartographic clusters. These clusters
are called « dendremes » in the tree, and their cor-
respondences on the map « choremes ». The heu-
ristic comparison of Maps 7 and 8 concentrates on
the position of the dendremes in the tree and simul-
taneously on the position of the choremes on the
map. First, the perfect spatial coherence of all cho-
remes is striking. Further, it clearly results that the
three dendremes (No. 1-3) at the top seize the East,
the North and the Centre (including the West) of
the Domaine d’Oïl, though in such a way that the
central dendreme-choreme (No. 1) expanded in the
course of the six centuries between 1300 and 1900
at the expense of the Eastern (No. 3) and the Nor-
thern (No. 2) choreme-dendreme. Again, this is a
consequence of the irradiation of the dialect of the
Ile-de-France, supported by the French royal dy-
nasty and the Republic.

5 Final remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698352941176">
By the visual comparison of four pairs of maps
established with dialectometrical methods, evi-
dence was given that the geolinguistic deep struc-
tures of the Domaine d’Oïl (Northern France) – in
the period between 1300 and 1900 – maintained a
large stability, that is to say : remained mostly
identical in regard to their phonetics. Hence the
question arises on determining the chronological
development and elaboration before 1300 of these
phonetic deep structures. Nevertheless, the present
investigation revealed the actual expansion of the
linguistic type of the Ile-de-France between 1300
and 1900 which represents the typological basis for
standard French. The dialectometrical techniques,
which were again applied in this contribution, have
proven many times their great diagnostic value in
the last three decades.
