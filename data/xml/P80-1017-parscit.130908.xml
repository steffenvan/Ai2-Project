Progress on natural language interfaces can perhaps be
stimulated or directed by imagining the ideal natural
language system of the future. What features (or even
design philosophies) should such a system have in order
to become an integral part of our work environments?
What scaled-down versions of these features might be
possible in the near nature in &amp;quot;simple service systems&amp;quot;
[27? These issues can be broken down into the following
four questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989288977272727">
1. What are the significant features of the environment
in which the system will reside? The system will be one
participant in an intricate information network, depend-
ing on a continually reinforced shared complex of knowl-
edge [9]. To be an integral part of this environment,
the system must possess some of the shared knowledge and
perhaps must participate in its reinforcement, e.g. via
explanations, [9], [2].
2. Investigations of person-person communication should
tell us what person-system communication ought to be
like. Face-to-face conversation is extraordinarily rich
in the information that is conveyed by various means,
such as gesture, body position, gaze direction [4], [8].
In addition to conveying propositional content or infor-
mation, what are the principal functions that moves in
conversation perform?
a. Organization of the interaction, regulation of turns
[7], Cl]. In the natural language dialog systems of
today, each turn consists of a sentence or less. In ex-
periments done at SRI on instruction dialogs between
people over computer terminals, the instructor&apos;s turns
usually involve long texts. It was discovered that the
student needs a way of interrupting. That is, some sort
of turn-taking mechanisms are required. What can we
learn from the turn-taking mechanisms people use?
b. Orientation of the participants toward each other,
including recognition [6], expressions of solidarity and
indications of agreement and disagreement [3], meta-
comments on the direction of the conversation [a] or the
reasons for certain utterances ([9] on discourse expla-
nations).
c. Maintenance of the channel of communication, implic-
it acknowledgment or verification of information con-
veyed [2]. Recovery from mistakes and breakdowns in
communication [C., e.g. via flexibility in parsing and
interpretation [2]; via explicit indications of in-
comprehension [2] and repairs [5]. In natural language
systems of today, when the user makes a mistake and the
system fails to interpret the input, the user must usu-
ally begin over again. The system cannot use whatever
it did get from the mistake to aid in the interpretation
of the repair. People are more efficient. What are the
principal means of repair that people use, and how can
they be carried over to natural language systems?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.917500714285714">
d. Building and reinforcing the mutual knowledge base,
i.e. the knowledge the participants share and know they
share, etc. [9]. Linking new or out-of-the-ordinary
information to shared knowledge via explanations [9],
[2].
e. Inferring others goals, knowledge, abilities, focus
of attention [8], [2], [4]. The system should have a
model of the user and of the communication situation
[a].
f. Communicating one&apos;s own goals, knowledge, abilities,
focus of attention [8], [2]. Establishing and main-
taming one&apos;s role, e.g. as a competent, cooperative
participant (cf. [8]; [9]; Cl] for the role of speech
Style; [4] for defense of competence). In addition to
the system having a model of the user, the user will
have a model of the system, determined by the nature of
his interaction with it. The system should thus be
tailored to convey an accurate image of what the system
can do. For example, superficial politeness or fluency
(&amp;quot;Good morning, Jerry. What can I do for you today?&amp;quot;)
is more likely to mislead the user about the system&apos;s
capabilities than to ease the interaction. What the
system does, via lexical choice, indirect speech acts,
polite forms, etc., to maintain its role in the inter-
action should arise out of a coherent view of what the
role is. The linguistic competence of the system is an
important element of the image it conveys to the user
r2].

3. When we move from face-to-face conversations to
dialogs over computer terminals, the communication is
purely verbal. The work done non-verbally now has to be
realized verbally. How are the realizations of the
above functions altered over the change of channels

[8]? We know, for example, that there are more utter-
ances showing solidarity and asking for opinions,
because this is work done non-verbally face-to-face [3].
Some things that occur face-to-face (e.g. tension
release, jokes) seem to be expendable over computer
terminals, where each utterance costs the speaker more.
The messages take longer to produce, are less transi-
tory, and can be absorbed more carefully, so there is
less asking for orientation, elaboration, and correction
[3]. What devices are likely to be borrowed from
related but more familiar communication frames [1]?
Possible frames are letters or telephone conversations.
4. Should and how can these functions be incorporated
into the ideal natural language systems of the far
future and the simple service systems of the near
future [2], [8]?
