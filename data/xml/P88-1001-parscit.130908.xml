UDICT is a dictionary system intended to sup-
port the lexical needs of computer programs that
do natural language processing (NLP). Its first
version was built for English and has been used
in several systems needing a variety of informa-
tion about English words (Heidom, et al.(1982),
Sowa(1984), McCord(1986), and Neff and
Byrd(1987)). As described in Byrd(1986),
UDICT provides a framework for supplying syn-
tactic, semantic, phonological, and morphological
information about the words it contains.
Part of UD1CT&apos;s apparatus is a morphological
analysis subsystem capable of recognizing
morphological variants of the words whose
lemma forms are stored in UDICI&amp;quot;s dictionary.
The English version of this analyzer has been de-
scribed in Byrd(l983) and Byrd, et al. (1986) and
allows UDICT to recognize inflectionally and
derivationally affixed words, compounds, and
collocations. The present paper describes an ef-
fort to build a French version of UDICT. It
briefly discusses the creation of the dictionary
data itself and then focuses on issues raised in
handling French inflectional morphology.

The primary role of the dictionary in an NLP
system is to store and retrieve information about
words. In order for NLP systems to be effective,
their dictionaries must contain a lot of informa-
tion about a lot of words. Chodorow, et al.(1985)
and Byrd, et al.(1987) discuss techniques for
building dictionaries with the required scope by
extracting lexical information from machine-
readable versions of published dictionaries. Be-
sides serving the NLP application, some of the
lexical information supports that part of the dic-
tionary&apos;s access mechanism which permits recog-
nition of morphological variants of the stored
words. We have build a UDICT dictionary con-
taining such morphological information for
French by starting with an existing spelling cor-
rection and synonym aid dictionary&apos; and by add-
ing words and information from the
French-English dictionary in Collins(1978).
French UDICT contains a data base of over
40,000 lemmata which are stored in a direct access
file managed by the Dictionary Access Method
(Byrd, et al. (1986)). Each entry in this file has
one of the lemmata as its key and contains lexical
information about that lemma. Other than the
word&apos;s part-of-speech, this information is repres-
ented as binary features and multi-valued attri-
butes. The feature information relevant for
inflectional analysis includes the following:

Some of these features are explicitly stored in
UDICT&apos;s data base. Other features — including
many of the stored ones — control morphological
processing by being tested and set by rules in
ways that will be described in the next section.
Stored features and attributes which are not af-
fected by (and do not affect) morphological
processing are called -morphologically neutral.&apos;
Morphologically neutral information appears in
UDICT&apos;s output with its stored values unaltered.
Such information could include translations from
a transfer dictionary in a machine translation
system or selectional restrictions used by an NLP
system. For French, no such information is
stored now, but in other work (Byrd, et al.
(1987)) we have demonstrated the feasibility of
transferring some additional lexical information
(for example, semantic features such as
[ + human]) from English UD1CT via bilingual
dictionaries.
It may be useful to point out that, given the
ability to store such information about words,
one way of building a lexical subsystem would
be to exhaustively list and store all inflected words
in the language with their associated lexical in-
formation. There are at least three good reasons
for not doing so. First, even with the availability
of efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms, the
number of inflected forms is prohibitively large.
We estimate that the ratio of the number of
French inflected forms to lemmata is around 5 (a
little more for verbs, a little less for adjectives and
nouns). This ratio would require our 40,000
lemmata to be stored as 200,000 entries, thore
than we would like. The second reason is that
inflected forms sharing the same lemma also share
a great deal of other lexical information: namely
the morphologically neutral information men-
tioned earlier. Redundant storage of that infor-
mation in many related inflected forms does not
make sense linguistically or computationally.
Furthermore, as new words are added to the dic-
tionary, it would be an unnecessary complication
to generate the inflected forms and duplicate the
morphologically neutral information. Storing the
information only once with the lemma and al-
lowing it to be inherited by derived forms is a
more reasonable approach. Third, it is clear that
there are many regular processes at work in the
formation of inflected forms from their lemmata.
Discovering generalizations to capture those reg-
ularities and building computational mechanisms
to handle them is an interesting task in its own
right. We now turn to some of the details of that
task.

3.1. The mechanism. The UDICT morphological
analyzer assumes that words are derived from
other words by affixation, following
Aronoff(1976) and others. Consequently,
UDICT&apos;s word grammar contains affix rules
which express conditions on the base word and
makes assertions about the affixed word. These
conditions and assertions are stated in terms of
the kinds of lexical information listed in (1).
An example of an affix rule is the rule for forming
French plural nouns shown in Figure 1. This
rule — which, for example, derives chevaux from
cheval — consists of five parts. First, a boundary
marker indicates whether the affix is a prefix or a
suffix and whether it is inflectional or deriva-
tional. (Byrd(1983) describes further possible
distinctions which have so far not been exploited
in the French system.) Second, the affix name is
an identifier which will be used to describe the
morphological structure of the input word.
Third, the pattern expresses string tests and
modifications to be performed on the input word.
In this case, the string is tested for aux at its right
end (since this is a suffix rule), two characters are
removed, and the letter / is appended, yielding a
potential base word. This base word is looked
up via a recursive invocation of the rule applica-
tion mechanism which includes an attempt to re-
trieve the form from the dictionary of stored
lemmata. The fourth part of the rule, the condi-
tion, expresses constraints which must be met by
the base word. In this case, it must be a mascu-
line singular (and not plural) noun. The fifth part
of the rule, the assertion, expresses modifications
to be made to the features of the base in order to

describe the derived word. For this rule, the sin-
gular feature is turned off and the plural feature
is turned on. Features not mentioned in the as-
sertion retain their original values; in effect, the
derived word contains inherited morphologically
neutral lexical information from the base com-
bined with information asserted by the rule.
For the input chevaux (&amp;quot;horses&amp;quot;), the rule shown
in Figure I will produce the following analysis:
( 2) chevaux: cheval(noun plur masc
(structure &lt;&lt;*&gt;N -pn&gt;N))
In other words, chevaux is derived from cheval.
It is a plural noun by assertion. It is masculine
by inheritance. Its structure consists of the base
noun cheval (represented by &amp;quot;&lt;*&gt;N&amp;quot;) together
with the inflectional suffix &amp;quot;-pn&amp;quot;.
In order for rules such as these to operate, there
is a critical dependance on having reliable and
extensive lexical information about words hy-
pothesized as bases. This information comes
from three sources: the stored dictionary, redun-
dancy rules, and other recursively applied affix
rules.
While the assumption that affixes derive words
from other words seems entirely appropriate for
English, it at first seemed less so for French. An
initial temptation was to write affix rules which
derived inflected words by adding affixes to non-
word stems. This was especially true for verbs
where the inflected forms are often shorter than
the infinitives used as lemmata, and where some
of the verbs — particularly in the third group —
have very complex paradigms. However, our
rules&apos; requirement for testable lexical information
on base forms cannot be met by a system in
which bases are not words. The machine-
readable sources from which we build UDICT
dictionaries do not contain information about
non-word stems. It is furthermore difficult to
design procedures for eliciting such information
from native speakers, since people don&apos;t have
intuitions about forms that are not words. Con-
sequently, we have maintained the English model
in which only words are stored in UDICT&apos;s dic-
tionary.
UDICT&apos;s word grammar includes redundancy
rules which allow the expression of further gen-
eralizations about the properties of words. In a
sense, they represent an extension of the analysis
techniques used to populate the dictionary and
their output could well be stored in the diction-
ary. The following example shows two redun-
dancy rules in the French word grammar:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.669781">
(3) : (adj -masc -fem)(adj +masc)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97739825">
: e0 (adj +masc) (adj +fem)
The first rule has no boundary or affix name and
its pattern does nothing to the input word. It
expresses the notion that if an adjective is not
explicitly marked as either masculine or feminine
(the condition), then it should at least be consid-
ered masculine (the assertion). The second rule
says that any masculine adjective which ends in
e is also feminine. Examples are the adjectives
absurde, &amp;table, and vane which are both mas-
culine and feminine. Such rules reduce the bur-
den on dictionary analysis techniques whose job
is to determine the genders of adjectives from
machine-readable resources.
For inflectional affixation, we normally derive the
inflected form directly from the lemma. How-
ever, recursive rule application plays a role in the
derivation of feminine and plural forms of nouns,
adjectives, and participles — which will be dis-
cussed under &amp;quot;noun and adjective morphology&amp;quot;
— and in our method for handling stem
morphology of the French verbs belonging to the
third group, which will be discussed under &amp;quot;verb
morphology&apos;.
3.2. Noun and adjective morphology. For nouns
and adjectives, where inflectional changes to a
word&apos;s spelling occur only at its rightmost end,
the word-based model was simple to maintain.

<bodyText confidence="0.999558227272727">
As shown in Figure 1, the pattern mechanism
supports the needed tests and modifications. For
recognition of feminine plurals, we treat the
feminine-forming affixes as derivational ones (us-
ing an appropriate boundary), so that recursive
rule application assures that they always occur
inside or the plural inflectional affix. For ex-
ample heureuses is analyzed as the plural of
heureuse which itself is the feminine of heurewc
(-happy&amp;quot;). Similarly, glues (&amp;quot;chosen or elected&amp;quot;)
is the plural of elue which, in turn, is the feminine
of du itself analyzed as the past participle of the
verb dire (&amp;quot;to vote&amp;quot;). The final section of the
paper mentions another justification for treating
feminine-forming affixes as derivational.
3.3. Verb morphology. Many French verbs be-
longing to the first group (i.e., those whose
infinitives end in -er, except for aller) show
internal spelling changes when certain inflections
are applied. Examples are given in (4) where the
inflected forms on the right contain spelling al-
terations of the infinitive forms on the left.

These spelling changes are predictable and are not
directly dependent on the particular affix that is
being applied. Rather, they depend on
phonological properties of the affix such as
whether it is silent, which vowel it begins with,
etc. There are seven such spelling rules whose job
is to relate the spelling of the word part &amp;quot;inside
or the inflectional affix to its infinitive form.
These rules are given informally in (5). (The
sample patterns should be interpreted as in
Figure 1 and are intended to suggest the strategy
used to construct infinitive forms from the
inflected form. &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; represents an arbitrary con-
sonant, 1)&amp;quot; represents 1 or 1, and &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; represents a
repeated letter.)

and add er, as in jetteljeter
It would be inappropriate and uneconomical to
treat these spelling rules within the affix rules
themselves. If we did so, the same &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; would
be repeated as many times as there were rules to
which it applied. Rather, we handle these seven
spelling rules with special logic which not only
encodes the rules but also captures sequential
constraints on their application: if one of them
applies for a given affix, then none of the others
will apply. The spelling rules are invoked from
the affix rules by placing a &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; rather than a
in the pattern to denote a recursive lookup. In
effect, the base form is looked up modulo the set
of possible spelling changes. Example affix rules
largely responsible for (and corresponding to) the
forms shown in (4) are given in Figure 2.
Verbs of the third group are highly irregular.
Traditional French grammar books usually assign
each verb anywhere from one to six stem forms.
Some examples are given in (6).

Since our derivations are to be based on lemmata,
we need a way to associate infinitives with ap-
propriate stem forms. The mechanism we have
chosen is to let a special set of verb stem rules
perform that association. Recognition of the
inflected form of a third group verb thus becomes
a two-step process. In the first step, the outer-
most affix is recognized, and its inner part is
tested for being a valid stem. In the second step,
a verb stem rule attempts to relate the stem pro-
posed by the inflectional affix rule to an infinitive
in the dictionary. If it succeeds, it marks the
proposed stem as a valid one and the entire deri-
vation succeeds.
Consider, as an example, the rules and system
output shown in Figure 3. During the analysis
of the input saurions (&amp;quot;(we) would know&amp;quot;), the
rule in Figure 3(a) will first recognize and remove
the ending -rions, and then ask whether the re-
sulting sau meets the condition &amp;quot;(v +stem
- inf )&amp;quot;. Application of the verb stem rule in
Figure 3(b) will successfully relate sau to savoir
and assert its description to include &amp;quot;( v +stem
- inf ) , thus meeting the condition of rule (a).
The result will be the successful recognition of
saurions with the analysis given in Figure 3(c).
Note that the structure given does not mention
the occurrence of the &amp;quot;+vstem&amp;quot; affix; this is in-
tentional and reflects our belief that the two-level
structural analysis — inflectional affix plus
infinitive lemma — is the appropriate output for
all verbs. The intermediate stem level, while im-
portant for our processing, is not shown in the
output for verbs of the third group.
The French word grammar contains 165 verb
stem rules and another 110 affix rules for third
group verbs. Given the extent of the idiosyncrasy
of these verbs and their finite number (there are
only about 350 of them), it is natural to wonder
whether we might not do just as well by storing
the inflected forms. In addition to the arguments
given above (about redundant storage of
morphologically neutral lexical information, etc.),
we can observe that there are generalizations to
be made for which treatment by rule is appropri-
ate. The lists of verbs shown in (6c,d) have
common stem pattemings. Lexicalization of the
derived forms of these words would not allow us
to capture these generalizations or to handle the
admittedly rare coinage of new words which fit
these patterns.

4. Summary and further work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921192307692">
A recognizer for French inflected words has been
built using a modified version of UDICT, which
is programmed in PL/I and runs on IBM
mainframe computers. Approximately 400 affix
and verb stem rules were required, of which over
half are devoted to the analysis of French verbs
belonging to the third group. 15 redundancy
rules and 7 spelling rules were also written. In
addition to many minor changes not mentioned
in this paper, the major effort in adapting the
formerly English-only UDICT system to French
involved handling stem morphology. French
UDICT contains a dictionary of over 40,000
lemmata, providing fairly complete initial cover-
age of most French texts, and forming a setting
in which to add further, morphologically neutral,
lexical information as required by various appli-
cations.
We are testing French UDICT with a corpus of
Canadian French containing well over 100,000
word types. (The corpus size is close to
100,000,000 tokens.) Initial results show that the
recognizer successfully analyzes over 99% of the
most frequent 2,000 types in the corpus, after we
discard those which are proper names or not
French. For a small number of words (fewer
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.969232">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882585365854">
than 25), spurious information was added to the
correct analysis. Work continues toward elimi-
nating those errors.
We believe that the resulting machinery will be
adequate for building dictionaries for other
European languages in which we are interested
(Spanish, Italian, and German). In particular,
we believe that the spelling rule mechanism will
help in recognizing German umlauted forms and
that the stem mechanism will serve to handle
highly irregular paradigms in all of these lan-
guages.
Expressing spelling rules in a more symbolic no-
tation (rather than as logic in a subroutine in-
voked from affix rules) would facilitate the task
of the grammar writer when creating
morphological analyzers for new languages. For
French, the bulk of the work done by spelling
rules is on behalf of verbs of the first group.
However, some of the spelling changes are also
observed in other verbs and in nouns and adjec-
tives. Currently those effects are handled by affix
rules. We look forward to generalizing the cov-
erage of our spelling rules and thereby further
simplifying the affix rules.
We also plan to expand our word grammar to
handle the more productive parts of French deri-
vational morphology. The attachment of deriva-
tional affixes to words is constrained by
conditions on a much more extensive set of lexi-
cal features than the attachment of inflectional
affixes. For example, we have observed that
feminine-forming suffixes apply only to nouns
which denote humans or domestic animals. The
idiosyncrasy of this constraint is typical of deri-
vational affixes and provides further justification
for our earlier decision to treat feminine-forming
suffixes as derivational. By discovering and ex-
ploiting such regularities within our framework,
we expect to cover a large set of derivational af-
fixes.

French UDICT contains a data base of over 40,000 lemmata which are stored in a direct access file managed by the Dictionary Access Method (Byrd, et al. (1986)). Each entry in this file has one of the lemmata as its key and contains lexical information about that lemma.

Stored features and attributes which are not affected by (and do not affect) morphological processing are called -morphologically neutral.&apos; Morphologically neutral information appears in UDICT&apos;s output with its stored values unaltered. Such information could include translations from a transfer dictionary in a machine translation system or selectional restrictions used by an NLP system. For French, no such information is stored now, but in other work (Byrd, et al. (1987)) we have demonstrated the feasibility of transferring some additional lexical information (for example, semantic features such as [ + human]) from English UD1CT via bilingual dictionaries. It may be useful to point out that, given the ability to store such information about words, one way of building a lexical subsystem would be to exhaustively list and store all inflected words in the language with their associated lexical information. There are at least three good reasons for not doing so. First, even with the availability of efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms, the number of inflect</context>
