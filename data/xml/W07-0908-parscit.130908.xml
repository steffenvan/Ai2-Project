Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
In this paper, we argue on the interest of an-
choring Dutch Cultural Heritage controlled
vocabularies to WordNet, and demonstrate
a reusable methodology for achieving this
anchoring. We test it on two controlled
vocabularies, namely the GTAA thesaurus,
used at the Netherlands Institute for Sound
and Vision (the Dutch radio and television
archives), and the GTT thesaurus, used to in-
dex books of the Dutch National Library. We
evaluate the two anchorings having in mind a
concrete use case, namely generic alignment
scenarios where concepts from one thesaurus
must be aligned to concepts from the other.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998548142857143">
Cultural Heritage Institutions are the keepers of large
collections of data. To optimize the core tasks of
indexing and searching through these collections,
controlled vocabularies like thesauri are often used.
These vocabularies are structured concept networks1
and help indexers to select proper subjects for de-
scription, and users to formulate queries or to browse
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.889896125">
1The typical semantic relationships found between elements
from thesauri are Broader Term linking a specialized concept
to a more general one, Narrower Term, its inverse relationship,
and Related Term, which denotes a general associative link.
Thesauri also contain lexical information, where the preferred
terms used for description are given synonyms or non-preferred
terms (Use and Used for links), as well as general scope notes
giving indexers instructions regarding the use of a term.

collections using the concepts that appear in the
metadata.
The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision2,
for example, uses the GTAA thesaurus for indexing
public radio and TV programs – GTAA is a Dutch
abbreviation for “Common Thesaurus [for] Audio-
visual Archives”. Its hierarchy of subjects contains
about 3800 Preferred Terms and 2000 Non Preferred
terms. A second example is the GTT thesaurus, which
contains 35000 concepts, gathering 50000 preferred
and non-preferred Dutch terms. This thesaurus is
used to index and retrieve books from the Dutch Na-
tional Library3 – GTT is a Dutch abbreviation for
“GOO keyword thesaurus”, GOO referring to the Joint
Subject Indexing system used by many Dutch li-
braries.
Besides this classic scenario, thesauri can also al-
low for (semi-)automatic optimization of search pro-
cesses, like query expansion exploiting their hierar-
chical structure. But the available structure might
not be rich and regular enough for such purposes. In
fact, it has been shown that a mapping to a richer
and sounder terminology, like the English Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998), would enable more sophisti-
cated query expansion or other inferencing possibil-
ities (Voorhees, 1994; Hollink, 2006). This will be-
come especially true now that WordNet exists in the
form of an RDF ontology (van Assem et al., 2006).

ies in Dutch to WordNet can also be beneficial for
sharing information across institutions, which is dif-
ficult when the metadata attached to the different doc-
uments come from different thesauri. This issue can
be solved by building equivalence links between the
elements from these different vocabularies, as in (van
Gendt et al., 2006). This vocabulary alignment prob-
lem is comparable to the ontology matching one, and
techniques similar to the ones developed by the Se-
mantic Web research community can be applied here.
As found e.g. in (Euzenat, 2004), the existing meth-
ods are quite diverse, and proposed strategies often
mix several individual techniques:

<listItem confidence="0.9920684">
• lexical techniques, trying to compare the labels

jects that are actually populating the ontologies

knowledge source, by trying to derive from the
information found there relations between the
elements from the original vocabularies.
Here, we are interested in the last kind of techniques.
In these approaches, concepts from the vocabular-
ies to be aligned are first attached – “anchored” –
to the concepts from a third vocabulary (Aleksovski,
2006). Then, these anchors in the background vo-
cabulary are compared together. When a relation is
found between them4, a similar relation can be in-
ferred between the elements from the vocabularies
to be aligned. This is especially interesting when
the lexical overlap between the vocabularies is low
or when the vocabularies are quite poorly structured:
it is expected then that the background knowledge
will alleviate these shortcomings. The choice of

this knowledge is therefore crucial, and WordNet,
which has a rich structure and a broad coverage, has
been exploited in many existing alignment methods
(Giunchiglia et al., 2005; Castano et al., 2005).
For these reasons – even if this paper will only
focus on the alignment scenario – we wanted to ex-
periment the anchoring of two aforementioned Dutch
thesauri to WordNet. Unlike literature about linking
English thesauri to WordNet, we propose in this pa-
per an anchoring method for vocabularies in other
languages, and experiment it on these two thesauri,
testing its usefulness in terms of possibilities for vo-
cabulary alignment. The remainder of the paper is
organized as follows: in section 2, we present the
general anchoring methodology. The anchoring ex-
periment is described in section 3: first the GTAA
case (section 3.1) and then the GTT one (section 3.2),
as a reusability test. We evaluate the two anchoring
processes in section 3.3 and conclude on general re-
flexions about this method. Then, we show exam-
ples of such anchorings in the context of a possible
alignment between GTAA and GTT in section 4. We
conclude on perspectives to this research in section 5.

2 Anchoring methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990666666667">
The anchoring experiment presented in this paper is
based on a comparison of lexical descriptions of the
thesaurus terms with the ones of WordNet synsets,
the glosses: WordNet is a lexical database of En-
glish, which entries are grouped “into sets of cog-
nitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct
concept”5. In contrast to many anchoring methods,
like the one in (Khan and Hovy, 1997), we do not
compare the terms from our thesauri to the labels of
synsets, but measure the lexical overlap of their de-
scriptions. The same approach has already been fol-
lowed, for example, by (Knight and Luk, 1994).
As the thesauri we focus on in this paper are in
Dutch, we first need to map their terms to English de-
scriptions, and possibly translations, to make a com-
parison with the English glosses. Given the fact that
these thesauri cover a broad range of topics, we hy-
pothesize that using a general language bilingual dic-

tionary will lead to a good coverage of their content.
Additionally, it might give on top of the definitions
– i.e. the natural language descriptions of a term’s
meaning – useful information such as term transla-
tions and Part Of Speech (POS) tags – their gram-
matical category: noun, verb, etc. For each thesaurus
term which has been associated to an English defini-
tion, the rest of the anchoring procedure consists in
checking the overlap between the lexical content of
the definitions and the one of the different WordNet
glosses, considered as bags of words. The hypothesis
is that the closest gloss should give us a pointer to a
synset semantically equivalent to the intended mean-
ing of a thesaurus term.

3.1 Anchoring GTAA concepts

<bodyText confidence="0.999855388888889">
First step: Finding English definitions for GTAA
terms The first step in mapping Dutch terms from
the GTAA to WordNet was to select an online dic-
tionary that would cover a significant part of the the-
saurus entries and that would allow automatic queries
for these terms. We have tested the bilingual dictio-
nary LookWAYup6, which returned a 2222 results –
definitions and translations – on our query set.
This query set consisted in the list of GTAA Pre-
ferred terms (3800), Non preferred terms (2000) and
their singular forms7 (3200). These singular forms
were computed in the context of a MultimediaN
project8, on the basis of linguistic derivational rules
and a manual correction.
Given the fact that most of the thesaurus terms are
in plural form, but not all of them9, and knowing that
the dictionary entries are only standard lemma forms
(most of the time in singular), we first assumed that

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.995118928571429">
queries on the dictionary with a plural form would
not generate a result, and simply added the singu-
lar forms to the singular ones in the query set. It
turned out that the dictionary gave result for some
plural forms, creating noise: some plural forms cor-
responded to lemmas of verbs, and a spelling cor-
rection facility provided definitions for some plural
forms.
Removing doubles We cleaned manually the first
set of errors, and automatically the last one, based
on POS tag information. In the future, we will avoid
introducing duplicate lemmas in our the query set.
After cleaning, 1748 terms had one or more trans-
lation in English together with their associated POS
tag(s) and definition(s)10. This low number, com-
pared with the original set of 5800 distinct thesaurus
terms can be explained by the fact that our vocabu-
lary contains numerous multi-words terms and also
compound entries, both of which are rarely dictio-
nary entries. We discuss possible solutions to this
shortcoming in section 3.3.
POS tag-based cleaning We did then a rough man-
ual evaluation of these candidate definitions. The
evaluation was conducted by three people and took
about one day each. It turned out that some of the
definitions were irrelevant for our task: the Dutch Bij
was associated with the English Bee and Honey bee,
but also with the preposition by. We used again the
information given by the POS tag to remove these
irrelevant definitions: we kept only definitions of
Nouns and (relevant) Verbs. After this last cleaning,
some terms still had more then one definition.
Cleaning based on thesaurus relationships We
used the hierarchical relationship in the thesaurus to
check the intended meaning of these terms: for ex-
ample, Universiteit (University) had a Broader Term
relationship with Wetenschappelijk onderwijs (Scien-
tific education), so its meaning is restricted to the
“Educational aspect”, and it should not be used to
describe TV programs about University buildings for
instance. We used this information to restrict the
101299 terms have more than one definition.

number of valid candidate definitions associated with
every GTAA term. But in some cases the distinc-
tion was hard to make between the different defini-
tions, or no clue was provided by the thesaurus to
dismabiguate the senses of the term: sometimes it
did not have any relationship to other concepts nor
explanatory text (Scope Note).
Conclusion of the first step As a final result, as
summarized in table 1, 1655 GTAA terms had one
or more English equivalent and their related candi-
date definitions (7530). We decided to postpone a
more in-depth validation to the evaluation of anchor-
ing results with WordNet: we kept all candidate def-
initions and translations that were not obviously in-
correct, and checked the WordNet anchoring result
to see if some further refinement had to be done. The
idea was that the anchoring process would only work
for parts of the definitions, so we wanted to keep as
many data as possible.
Second step: Anchoring to WordNet synsets We
stemmed the candidate definitions of GTAA terms and
the glosses from WordNet with the Porter stemmer to
augment mapping possibilities. Stemming is the op-
eration of reducing words to a root, for example by
removing the “s’ character at the end of an (English)
word in plural form. This process can reduce differ-
ent unrelated words to a same root, and hence should
be handled with care, but it requires less resources
then a full fledged lemmatizing and helps compar-
ing a larger number of words then on the basis of the
graphical forms only. As announced, in order to map
synset to GTAA terms, we compared their lexical de-
scriptions: we compared the different sets of stems in
a simple bag-of-words approach. We actually found
out that the definitions of the online dictionary were
exact matches with WordNet glosses, thus all defined
terms could be straightforwardly anchored to one or
more synsets. In the end, 1060 concepts from GTAA
are successfully anchored to a synset, which repre-
sents 28% of the total number of concepts.
Evaluation of the results We evaluated the num-
ber of semantically relevant anchorings for a ran-
dom representative part of the the 1655 GTAA terms
that had one or more WordNet anchor: we evaluated
1789 mappings out of 7530. On these 1789 map-
pings, 85 were not equivalence links: 5 out of these
85 links were relating Related Terms (like zeerov an-
chored to corsair, the first being in GTAA a profes-
sion and the second a ship in Wordnet), 17 pointed
to Broader Terms, and the others were mapping a
term with a correct translation that was correct per
se but did not correspond to the intended meaning
of the term in GTAA. For example, two anchorings
were proposed for Vrouwen: married woman and fe-
male person, the latter one being the only valid for
our thesaurus. The first cases (RT and BT relation-
ships between the original term and its anchoring)
still provide useful information for aligning vocab-
ularies, but we took only equivalence relationships
into account in this experiment.
An additional evaluation that was also performed
on a sample set was to check that non-preferred terms
that were given a definition were pointing to the same
synset as their related preferred terms. It turned to be
correct for the evaluated pairs.
On a qualitative perspective, we found different
types of mappings:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994097888888889">
• some GTAA terms had more then one transla-
tion, all of them pointing to the same synset: this
was the confirmation that the mapping from the
term to the synset was correct;
• some GTAA terms had more then one trans-
lation, pointing to different but close synsets:
nothing in the thesaurus content could help us
distinguish between the different synsets, thus
we kept the different possibilities;
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.863142">

<bodyText confidence="0.917999714285714">
• some different GTAA terms pointed to a same
synset and, although they were not linked in
the thesaurus, they had a semantic relationship.
This information can be used to enrich the struc-
ture of the GTAA.
We can conclude that the anchoring was quite suc-
cessful: only 4.7% of the anchorings were incorrect
in the test sample. And this was due to cases where
multiple senses were linked to a same term, which
would not cause a big problem in a semi-automated
anchoring process. Moreover, this process can bring
an additional value to the thesaurus structure itself,
on top of the possible applications mentioned in the
introduction.

3.2 Anchoring GTT concepts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999627402777778">
Setting We carried out for GTT the same exper-
iment as for GTAA, but did not compute singular
forms, although GTT terms are generally in plural
form. Also, because GTT had 70% of its concepts al-
ready translated to English by human experts, we de-
cided that we would measure the global performance
of our method based on this translation gold standard,
additionally to manually assess the relevance of the
produced anchorings from GTT to WordNet.
Results Out of the 35194 GTT general subjects,
only 2458 were given some English definition and
translation by the dictionary service we used. For the
set of 25775 concepts for which there was already a
translation, the figure drops down to 2279, slightly
less than 9%.
As said, we tested the validity of these definitions
and translations by comparing them to the expert
translations. Our assumption was that an English def-
inition for a concept would prove to be correct if its
associated term matched one of the expert transla-
tions of the concept11. We found that 1479 of the
2279 concepts being given both expert and automatic
translations had the expert translation confirming one
11A manual checking of this assumption on the first 150 con-
cepts matching the criterion demonstrated an error rate of 4%:
4% of the concepts had no correct definition in their associated
glosses while there was a match between the expert translation
and one of the terms linked to the definitions.
of the automatically found ones, i.e. a precision rate
of 65% in terms of defined concepts.
When measuring accuracy of the found English
definitions for the 2279 defined concepts, we saw that
out of a total 3813 English definitions associated to a
concept, 2626 – 69% – had an associated term con-
firmed by the expert translation.
We also tried to assess the quality of the trans-
lations associated to the concepts of this set by our
method: out of 5747 terms proposed as translations,
1479 matched the expert translation. This precision
rate is low (25.7%) but it actually highlights one of
the problem of the expert translations found in the
thesaurus: the manual translation had a very low lex-
ical coverage, having provided with very few syn-
onyms for the “preferred” translations. The set of
25775 translated GTT concepts only brings 26954
English terms in total...
The evaluation by comparison to the expert trans-
lation brings useful information, but it has some
drawbacks, especially the limited coverage of the
translation work and a correctness assumption bring-
ing a (small) error rate. To complete it, we carried
out a manual investigation, inspired by what had been
done for the GTAA thesaurus.
For this, we selected the 179 concepts that were
translated by our method but had not previously been
assigned English labels by experts. For this subset,
441 glosses had been assigned. Of these, 172 were
correct, concerning 138 concepts. We therefore ob-
tain a 77% precision rate in terms of anchored con-
cepts. However, if we aim at assessing the quality
of the method and its potential to be used in a semi-
automatic anchoring process, we have to consider the
obtained glosses themselves. And here precision falls
to 39%, which is a far less satisfactory figure.
Feasibility of the proposed method in GTT case
Some of the previously mentioned anchorings to
wrong glosses could have been successfully found
by applying the heuristics mentioned in section 3.1.
The use of POS tags and the checking of the singu-
lar form of terms allowed to manually spot 41 ob-
viously wrong results. The other irrelevant glosses
were mainly found using the thesaurus information:

the Broader Term information helped to discriminate
68 cases, compared with 6 for Related Term, 6 for
synonyms and 15 for scope notes.
It is however still uncertain whether these differ-
ent kinds of information can be used in a more au-
tomatised setting. If we could count on translation
of broader and related terms to be done by the pro-
cess we have applied, taking into account scope notes
would require more effort. And the poor structure of
thesauri such as GTT – some 20000 concepts have no
parents at all – makes such validations by semantic
links difficult. It is also important to notice that in
14 cases, it was necessary to check the books which
have been indexed by a concept to find out its precise
meaning.
This could yet be compensated by an interesting
result we have observed: the anchoring method gave
us material for inferring new semantic links, as in the
GTAA case. Amongst the translated GTT concepts,
689 concepts are sharing at least one synset and are
not connected by a thesaurus link. We found inter-
esting matches, such as gratie (pardon) and absolutie
(absolution) or between honger (hunger) and dorst
(thirst). This potential for enriching thesauri could
actually be used to spark some positive feedback loop
for the anchoring process itself: a richer vocabulary
enables for example to use with greater profit the se-
lection strategies based on thesaurus structure.
An important problem for the implementation of
such strategies remains to deal with disambiguation
(when several English definitions are found, which
one shall be selected?) in a context of fine-grained
vocabularies. Both GTT and WordNet have a high
level of precision, but they are focused on different
matters. Especially, for a same GTT term the dic-
tionary pointed at several meanings that were very
close, but considered as different synsets in Word-
Net. A typical example is the distinction made be-
tween the gloss attached to moderation and temper-
ance, “the trait of avoiding excesses”, and the one
attached to moderateness and moderation, “quality
of being moderate and avoiding extremes”. Look-
ing at the books indexed by the concepts which these
glosses were attached to, it was not clear whether the
indexers systematically considered such a distinction.
Finally, we made rough estimattions of recall –
the number of concepts that were correctly anchored
compared to the number of concepts anchored in the
ideal case. If we compare the 1479 correctly defined
concepts to the 25775 concepts being given an expert
translation, we find a very disappointing recall rate
of 5.7%. This very low performance is in fact largely
due to three recurrent situations in which the online
dictionary could not give any translation:

anchoring: a qualitative evaluation
3.3 Conclusion on the anchoring methodology
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.996338807692308">
As just mentioned, a drawback of our anchoring
method is the fact that there are very few multi-
word entries in dictionaries but they compose a large
part of thesauri, and particularly thesauri in Dutch.
Previous work about assigning a semantic relation-
ship between a multi-word term and its components
(see (Ibekwe, 2005)) could be used in order to give
elements of solution to this problem. Using this pre-
processing, we could apply our method to the single-
word part that corresponds to the generic meaning
of the original multi-word term, and try to anchor
the single-word corresponding to the semantic root of
the thesaurus’ multi-word term (Kosten for Algemene
kosten – Cost for General cost – for instance).
From a more conceptual point of view, however,
further effort would be needed to adapt our anchor-
ing method – and the subsequent alignment of one
vocabulary with the other – to the cases where a
concept from one vocabulary should be anchored to
more than one element from WordNet. More com-
plex heuristics come closer to traditional anchoring
problems cases – without translation – and could
be solved using existing solutions, as proposed by
(Giunchiglia et al., 2005; Castano et al., 2005).
The last problem encountered in the anchoring
process was the fact that specialized notions, that also
appear in general purpose thesauri, have usually no
definition in a general language dictionary. Special-
ized dictionaries should be used as a complementary
resource.
These different shortcomings reduced the cover-
age of the anchoring, but our method has still posi-
tive points: the number of obviously wrong anchors
was rather low for the found pairs and additional links
could be provided for both of the source thesauri.
This method also provides a starting point for an-
choring complex and large vocabularies to WordNet,
which is also a large lexical resource, and both are
hard to grasp completely by a human expert.
Once the anchoring is performed, the synsets cor-
responding to the terms from the different thesauri
can be compared, in order to infer from them equi-
valences between the original concepts, as is done
in classical alignment techniques using background
knowledge. In this section, we present some exam-
ples illustrating the kind of alignment results one can
expect from a proper anchoring of our Dutch con-
trolled vocabularies.
First, we can confirm alignments of equal Dutch
labels: gtaa:arbeiders is aligned to gtt:arbeiders
since they are both anchored to the synset “some-
one who works with their hand, someone engaged
in manual labor”. In some cases, though, a first
stemming or lemmatizing process would have been
needed to achieve alignment, as in the example of
gtaa:bekeringen and gtt:bekering (Conversion, re-
spectively in plural and singular form), or gtaa:biljart
and gtt:biljartspel12 (Billiard and Billiard game).
Nevertheless, the more interesting cases are the
ones involving concepts with large semantic overlap
but a small lexical one, as in the case of gtaa:plant
(Plant) and gtt:begroeiing (Excessive growth of ve-
getation) via the WordNet flora synset. Begroeiing is
actually semantically related in the GTT to the con-
cept Planting. Here, the translation process compen-
sates for the lack of lexical coverage in the respective
vocabularies, which precisely corresponds to one of
the traditional features background knowledge-based
techniques boast. We can also derive general con-
ceptual similarity relationship based on the overlap
between glosses, such as the one between gtaa:drank
and gtt:alcohol, which are not direct matches but for
which our method has found some common glosses
like “an alcoholic beverage that is distilled rather than
fermented”.
12Notice that substring-based matching could also give these
results, but this method is usually very noisy for alignment pro-
cesses and therefore must be used cautiously.

5 Conclusion and perspectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990465116279">
Our experiments showed that the partial anchoring
of large Dutch controlled vocabularies to WordNet
can be done via a bilingual dictionary, even though
there is an obvious loss in information: not every
thesaurus concept can easily be found in a general
language bilingual dictionary, and a preprocessing of
multi-word and compound thesaurus entries has to be
done. Yet, a significant part of the GTAA thesaurus
could be anchored, and with some improvement to
the method this could be true for GTT too. Besides
multi-word and compound words processing, useful
extensions should also take into account specialized
dictionaries and have a closer look at methodologies
for anchoring a thesaurus term to multiple WordNet
synsets with close meanings. We plan to test such
strategies in future experiments, and hope to obtain a
better coverage of the thesauri.
In this paper, we have sketched a way to use of
these anchorings in a vocabulary alignment scenario,
and underlined the potential gains on test examples.
Even if the number of results given by the current im-
plementation of our method is quite low, the reader
should notice that the process can already, as is,
suggest new relationships between concepts of the
source thesauri. Moreover, proposed strategies in
the alignment field often advocate using combined
methods: combined contributions can be used to pro-
ceed with some cross validation if they overlap, or
to provide with larger number of candidate for fur-
ther (semi-)automatic selection. In such a setting, ev-
ery contribution of candidate links is welcome. In
this respect, what is useful here is the ability of a
WordNet-based method to provide with results that
could not be obtained with other techniques because
of the lack of explicit semantic information and hier-
archical structure in the original vocabularies.
Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, there are
other motivating use cases that we plan to experiment
with. Especially interesting is the way a mapping
with WordNet can enhance the existing access to doc-
ument collections of the Dutch Cultural Heritage In-
stitutes by providing with query refinement services
and browsing possibilities.
