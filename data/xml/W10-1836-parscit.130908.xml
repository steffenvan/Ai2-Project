<bodyText confidence="0.999537533333333">
The revised Arabic PropBank (APB) reflects
a number of changes to the data and the proc-
ess of PropBanking. Several changes stem
from Treebank revisions. An automatic proc-
ess was put in place to map existing annota-
tion to the new trees. We have revised the
original 493 Frame Files from the Pilot APB
and added 1462 new files for a total of 1955
Frame Files with 2446 framesets. In addition
to a heightened attention to sense distinctions
this cycle includes a greater attempt to ad-
dress complicated predicates such as light
verb constructions and multi-word expres-
sions. New tools facilitate the data tagging
and also simplify frame creation.

Recent years have witnessed a surge in available
automated resources for the Arabic language.1
These resources can now be exploited by the
computational linguistics community with the
aim of improving the automatic processing of
Arabic. This paper discusses semantic labeling.
Shallow approaches to semantic processing are
making large advances in the direction of effi-
ciently and effectively deriving application rele-
vant explicit semantic information from text
(Pradhan et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002;
Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002;
Xue and Palmer, 2004; Chen and Rambow,
2003; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Moschitti,
2004; Moschitti et al., 2005; Diab et al., 2008).
Indeed, the existence of semantically annotated
resources in English such as FrameNet (Baker et
al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer,
2003; Palmer et al., 2005) corpora have marked a
surge in efficient approaches to automatic se-

mantic labeling of the English language. For ex-
ample, in the English sentence, ‘John enjoys
movies’, the predicate is ‘enjoys’ and the first
argument, the subject, is ‘John’, and the second
argument, the object, is ‘movies’. ‘John’ would
be labeled as the agent/experiencer and ‘movies’
would be the theme/content. According to Prop-
Bank, ‘John’ is labeled Arg0 (or enjoyer) and
‘movies’ is labeled Arg1 (or thing enjoyed). Cru-
cially, that independent of the labeling formalism
adopted, the labels do not vary in different syn-
tactic constructions, which is why proposition
annotation is different from syntactic Treebank
annotation. For instance, if the example above
was in the passive voice, ‘Movies are enjoyed by
John’, ‘movies’ is still the Theme/Content (Arg1)
and (thing enjoyed), while ‘John’ remains the
Agent/Experiencer (Arg0) and (enjoyer). Like-
wise for the example ‘John opened the door’ vs.
‘The door opened’, in both of these examples
‘the door’ is the Theme (Arg1). In addition to
English, there are PropBank efforts in Chinese
(Xue et al., 2009), Korean (Palmer et al. 2006)
and Hindi (Palmer et al., 2009), as well as Fra-
meNet annotations in Chinese, German, Japa-
nese, Spanish and other languages (Hans 2009).
Being able to automatically apply this level of
analysis to Arabic is clearly a desirable goal, and
indeed, we began a pilot Arabic PropBank effort
several years ago (Palmer et al., 2008).
In this paper, we present recent work on adapting
the original pilot Arabic Proposition Bank (APB)
annotation to the recent changes that have been
made to the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al.,
2008). These changes have presented both lin-
guistic and engineering challenges as described
in the following sections. In Section 2 we discuss
major linguistics changes in the Arabic Treebank
annotation, and any impact they might have for
the APB effort. In Section 3 we discuss the engi-
neering ramifications of adding and deleting
nodes from parse trees, which necessitates mov-

cations. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss the cur-
rent APB annotation pipeline, which takes into
account all of these changes. We conclude with a
statement of our current goals for the project.

2 Arabic Treebank Revision and APB
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997225145454545">
The Arabic syntactic Treebank Part 3 v3.1 was
revised according to the new Arabic Treebank
Annotation Guidelines. Major changes have af-
fected the NP structure and the classification of
verbs with clausal arguments, as well as im-
provements to the annotation in general.2
The Arabic Treebank (ATB) is at the core of the
APB annotations. The current revisions have re-
sulted in a more consistent treebank that is closer
in its analyses to traditional Arabic grammar.
The ATB was revised for two levels of linguistic
representation, namely morphological informa-
tion and syntactic structure. Both of these
changes have implications for APB annotations.
The new ATB introduced more consistency in
the application of morphological features to POS
tags, hence almost all relevant words in the ATB
have full morphological features of number,
gender, case, mood, and definiteness associated
with them. This more comprehensive application
has implications on agreement markers between
nouns and their modifiers and predicative verbs
and their arguments, allowing for more consis-
tent semantic analysis in the APB.
In particular, the new ATB explicitly marks the
gerunds in Arabic known as maSAdir (singular
maSdar.) MaSAdirs, now annotated as VN, are
typically predicative nouns that take arguments
that should receive semantic roles. The nouns
marked as VN are embedded in a new kind of
syntactic S structure headed by a VN and having
subject and object arguments similar to verbal
arguments. This syntactic structure, namely S-
NOM, was present in previous editions/versions
of the ATB but it was headed by a regular noun,
hence it was difficult to find. This explicit VN
annotation allows the APB effort to take these
new categories into account as predicates. For
instance [ﺪﺒﻜﺗ]VN [-ﻢھ]ARG0 [ةﺮﯿﺒﻛ ﺮﺋﺎﺴﺧ]ARG1,
transliterated as takab—udi-, meaning &apos;suffered&apos;

tactic Annotation Guidelines 2008) at

is an example of predicative nominal together
with its semantically annotated arguments ARG0
transliterated as -him, meaning &apos;they&apos; and ARG1
transliterated as xasA}ira kabiyrap, meaning
&apos;heavy losses&apos;.
Other changes in the ATB include idafa con-
structions (a means of expressing possession)
and the addition of a pseudo-verb POS tag for a
particular group of particles traditionally known
as “the sisters of ّنإ &lt;in—a &apos;indeed&apos; ”. These have
very little impact on the APB annotation.

3 Revised Treebank processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981325">
One of the challenges that we faced during the
process of revising the APB was the transfer of
the already existing annotation to the newly re-
vised trees -- especially since APB data encoding
is tightly coupled with the explicit tree structure.
Some of the ATB changes that affected APB
projection from the old pilot effort to the new
trees are listed as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979348142857143">
i. Changes to the tree structure
ii. Changes to the number of tokens -- both
modification (insertion and deletion) of
traces and modification to some tokeni-
zation
iii. Changes in parts of speech
iv. Changes to sentence breaks
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.77324380952381">
The APB modifications are performed within the
OntoNotes project (Hovy et al. 2006), we have
direct access to the OntoNotes DB Tool, which
we extended to facilitate a smooth transition. The
tool is modified to perform a three-step mapping
process:
a) De-reference the existing (tree) node-level
annotations to the respective token spans;
b) Align the original token spans to the best pos-
sible token spans in the revised trees. This was
usually straight forward, but sometimes the to-
kenization affected the boundaries of a span in
which case careful heuristics had to be employed
to find the correct mapping. We incorporated the
standard &amp;quot;diff&amp;quot; utility into the API. A simple
space separated token-based diff would not com-
pletely align cases where the tokenization had
been changed in the new tree. For these cases we
had to back-off to a character based alignment to
recover the alignments. This two-pass strategy
works better than using character-based align-

ment as a default since the diff tool does not have
any specific domain-level constraints and gets
spurious alignments;
c) Create the PropBank (tree) node-pointers for
the revised spans.
As expected, this process is not completely
automatic. There are cases where we can deter-
ministically transfer the annotations to the new
trees, and other cases (especially ones that in-
volve decision making based on newly added
traces) where we cannot. We automatically trans-
ferred all the annotation that could be done de-
terministically, and flagged all the others for hu-
man review. These cases were grouped into mul-
tiple categories for the convenience of the anno-
tators. Some of the part of speech changes in-
validated some existing annotations, and created
new predicates to annotate. In the first case, we
simply dropped the existing annotations on the
affected nodes, and in the latter we just created
new pointers to be annotated. We could auto-
matically map roughly 50% of the annotations.
The rest are being manually reviewed.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98639">
4.1 Annotation process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963631818181818">
APB consists of two major portions: the lexicon
resource of Frame Files and the annotated cor-
pus. Hence, the process is divided into framing
and annotation (Palmer et al., 2005).
Currently, we have four linguists (framers) creat-
ing predicate Frame Files. Using the frame crea-
tion tool Cornerstone, a Frame File is created for
a specific lemma found in the Arabic Treebank.
The information in the Frame File must include
the lemma and at least one frameset.
Previously, senses were lumped together into a
single frame if they shared the same argument
structure. In this effort, however, we are attempt-
ing to be more sensitive to the different senses
and consequently each unique sense has its own
frameset. A frameset contains an English defini-
tion, the argument structure for the frameset, a
set of (parsed) Arabic examples as an illustration,
and it may include Arabic synonyms to further
help the annotators with sense disambiguation.
Figure 1 illustrates the Frameset for the verb
ﻊﻤﺘﺳا isotamaE} &apos;to listen&apos;

<bodyText confidence="0.999971513513513">
In addition to the framers, we also have five na-
tive Arabic speakers as annotators on the team,
using the annotation tool Jubilee (described be-
low). Treebanked sentences from the ATB are
clearly displayed in Jubilee, as well as the raw
text for that sentence at the bottom of the screen.
The verb that needs to be tagged is clearly
marked on the tree for the annotators. A drop-
down menu is available for the annotators to use
so that they may choose a particular frameset for
that specific instance. Once a frameset is chosen
the argument structure will be displayed for them
to see. As a visual aid, the annotators may also
click on the “example” button in order to see the
examples for that particular frameset. Finally, the
complements of the predicate are tagged directly
on the tree, and the annotators may move on to
the next sentence. Figure 2 illustrates a sample
annotation.
Once the data has been double-blind annotated,
the adjudication process begins. An adjudicator,
a member of the framing team, provides the Gold
Standard annotation by going over the tagged
instances to settle any differences in the choices.
Occasionally a verb will be mis-lemmatized (e.g.
the instance may actually be ﻞّBَﺳ sah~al &apos;to cause
to become easy&apos; but it is lemmatized under ﻞُﮭَﺳ
sahul-u &apos;to be easy&apos; which looks identical without
vocalization.) At this point the lemmas are cor-
rected and sent back to the annotators to tag be-
fore the adjudicators can complete their work.
The framers and annotators meet regularly at
least every fortnight. These meetings are impor-
tant for the framers since they may need to con-
vey to the annotators any changes or issues with
the frames, syntactic matters, or anything else
that may require extra training or preparation for
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999871076923077">
the annotators. It is important to note that while
the framers are linguists, the annotators are not.
This means that the annotators must be instructed
on a number of things including, but not limited
to, how to read trees, and what forms a constitu-
ent, as well as how to get familiar with the tools
in order to start annotating the data. Therefore,
little touches, such as the addition of Arabic
synonyms to the framesets (especially since not
all of the annotators have the same level of flu-
ency in English), or confronting specific linguis-
tic phenomena via multiple modalities are a nec-
essary part of the process. To these meetings, the
annotators mostly bring their questions and con-
cerns about the data they are working on. We
rely heavily on the annotator’s language skills.
They take note of whether a frame appears to be
incorrect, is missing an argument, or is missing a
sense. And since they go through every instance
in the data, annotators are instrumental for point-
ing out any errors the ATB. Since everything is
discussed together as a group people frequently
benefit from the conversations and issues that are
raised. These bi-monthly meetings not only help
maintain a certain level of quality control but
establish a feeling of cohesion in the group.
The APB has decided to thoroughly tackle light
verb constructions and multi-word expressions as
part of an effort to facilitate mapping between
the different languages that are being Prop-
Banked. In the process of setting this up a num-
ber of challenges have surfaced which include:
how can we cross-linguistically approach these
phenomena in a (semi) integrated manner, how
to identify one construction from the other, figur-
ing out a language specific reliable diagnostic
test, and whether we deal with these construc-
tions as a whole unit or as separate parts; and
how? (Hwang, et al., 2010)

4.2 Tools
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956318181818">
Frameset files are created in an XML format.
During the Pilot Propbank project these files
were created manually by editing the XML file
related to a particular predicate. This proved to
be time consuming and prone to many formatting
errors. The Frame File creation for the revised
APB is now performed with the recently devel-
oped Cornerstone tool (Choi et al., 2010a), which
is a PropBank frameset editor that allows the
creation and editing of Propbank framesets with-
out requiring any prior knowledge of XML.
Moreover, the annotation is now performed by
Jubilee, a new annotation tool, which has im-
proved the annotation process by displaying sev-
eral types of relevant syntactic and semantic in-
formation at the same time. Having everything
displayed helps the annotator quickly absorb and
apply the necessary syntactic and semantic in-
formation pertinent to each predicate for consis-
tent and efficient annotation (Choi et al.,
20010b). Both tools are available as Open Source
tools on Google code.3

We have currently created 1955 verb predicate
Frame Files which correspond to 2446 framesets,
since one verb predicate Frame File can contain
one or more framesets. We will reconcile the
previous Arabic PropBank with the new Tree-
bank and create an additional 3000 Frame files to
cover the rest of the ATB3 verb types.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951583333333">
This paper describes the recently revived and
revised APB. The changes in the ATB have af-
fected the APB in two fundamentally different
ways. More fine-grained POS tags facilitate the
tasks of labeling predicate argument structures.
However, all of the tokenization changes have
rendered the old pointers obsolete, and new
pointers to the new constituent boundaries have
to be supplied. This task is underway, as well as
the task of creating several thousand additional
Frame Files to complete predicate coverage of
ATB3.

Some of the ATB changes that affected APB projection from the old pilot effort to the new trees are listed as follows: i. Changes to the tree structure ii. Changes to the number of tokens -- both modification (insertion and deletion) of traces and modification to some tokenization iii. Changes in parts of speech iv. Changes to sentence breaks The APB modifications are performed within the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al. 2006), we have direct access to the OntoNotes DB Tool, which we extended to facilitate a smooth transition. The tool is modified to perform a three-step mapping process: a) De-reference the existing (tree) node-level annotations to the respective token spans; b) Align the original token spans to the best possible token spans in the revised trees. This was usually straight forward, but sometimes the tokenization affected the boundaries of a span in which case careful heuristics had to be employed to find the correct mapping.

The APB has decided to thoroughly tackle light verb constructions and multi-word expressions as part of an effort to facilitate mapping between the different languages that are being PropBanked. In the process of setting this up a number of challenges have surfaced which include: how can we cross-linguistically approach these phenomena in a (semi) integrated manner, how to identify one construction from the other, figuring out a language specific reliable diagnostic test, and whether we deal with these constructions as a whole unit or as separate parts; and how?

Shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large advances in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving application relevant explicit semantic information from text (Pradhan et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Moschitti, 2004; Moschitti et al., 2005; Diab et al., 2008). Indeed, the existence of semantically annotated resources in English such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003; Palmer et al., 2005) corpora have marked a surge in efficient approaches to automatic se1 In this paper, we use Arabic to refer to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). mantic labeling of the English language. For example, in the English sentence, ‘John enjoys movies’, the predicate is ‘enjoys’ and the first argument, the subject, is ‘John’, and the second argument, the object, is ‘movies’. ‘John’ would be labeled as the agent/experiencer and ‘movies’ would be the theme/content. According to PropBank, ‘John’ is labeled Arg0 (or enjoyer) and ‘movies’ is labeled Arg1 (or thing enjoyed). Crucially, that independent of the l</context>

Some of the part of speech changes invalidated some existing annotations, and created new predicates to annotate. In the first case, we simply dropped the existing annotations on the affected nodes, and in the latter we just created new pointers to be annotated. We could automatically map roughly 50% of the annotations. The rest are being manually reviewed. 4 Annotation Tools and Pipeline 4.1 Annotation process APB consists of two major portions: the lexicon resource of Frame Files and the annotated corpus. Hence, the process is divided into framing and annotation (Palmer et al., 2005). Currently, we have four linguists (framers) creating predicate Frame Files. Using the frame creation tool Cornerstone, a Frame File is created for a specific lemma found in the Arabic Treebank. The information in the Frame File must include the lemma and at least one frameset. Previously, senses were lumped together into a single frame if they shared the same argument structure. In this effort, however, we are attempting to be more sensitive to the different senses and consequently each unique sense has its own frameset. A frameset contains an English definition, the argument structure for t</context>

For instance, if the example above was in the passive voice, ‘Movies are enjoyed by John’, ‘movies’ is still the Theme/Content (Arg1) and (thing enjoyed), while ‘John’ remains the Agent/Experiencer (Arg0) and (enjoyer). Likewise for the example ‘John opened the door’ vs. ‘The door opened’, in both of these examples ‘the door’ is the Theme (Arg1). In addition to English, there are PropBank efforts in Chinese (Xue et al., 2009), Korean (Palmer et al. 2006) and Hindi (Palmer et al., 2009), as well as FrameNet annotations in Chinese, German, Japanese, Spanish and other languages (Hans 2009). Being able to automatically apply this level of analysis to Arabic is clearly a desirable goal, and indeed, we began a pilot Arabic PropBank effort several years ago (Palmer et al., 2008). In this paper, we present recent work on adapting the original pilot Arabic Proposition Bank (APB) annotation to the recent changes that have been made to the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2008). These changes have presented both linguistic and engineering challenges as</context>
