<bodyText confidence="0.999669615384615">
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has tackled and
solved a lot of prediction problems in Biology. One
practical research issue is Protein Sub-Cellular Lo-
calization (PSL) Prediction. Many previous ap-
proaches have combined information from both texts
and sequences by a machine learning (ML) technique
(Shatkay et al., 2007). All of them have not used tra-
ditional NLP techniques such as parsing. Our aim
is to develop a novel PSL prediction system using
information from texts and sequences. At the same
time, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the tra-
ditional NLP and the sequence-based features in the
viewpoint of the text-based approach.

quences. To develop a supervised ML-based predic-
tion system, an annotated corpus is needed to train
the system. However, there is no publicly available
corpus that contains the PSL. Therefore, we have
constructed a corpus using GENIA corpus as an ini-
tial data, because the annotation of Protein and Cel-
lular component in GENIA corpus is already done
by human experts. The new types of annotation con-
tain two tasks. The first annotation is to classify
1,117 cellular components in GENIA corpus into 11
locations, and the second annotation is to catego-
rize a relation between a protein and a location into
positive, negative, and neutral. Biologists selected
11 locations based on Gene Ontology: Cytoplasm,
Cytoskeleton, Endoplasmic reticulum, Extracellular,
Golgi apparatus, Granule, Lysosome, Mitochondria,
Nucleus, Peroxisome, and Plasma membrane. The
number of co-occurrences in GENIA corpus is 864.

inter-annotator agreement. For calculating the inter-
annotator agreement, all annotators annotated 117

co-occurrences. From the texts, we used eight fea-
tures: (1) protein and cellular component names an-
notated by human experts, (2) adjacent one and two
words of names, (3) bag of words, (4) order of names,
(5) distance between names, (6) syntactic category
of names, (7) predicates of names, and (8) part-of-
speech of predicates. To analyze the syntactic struc-
ture, we used the ENJU full parser whose output is
predicate-argument structures of a sentence.
To combine the information from sequences, we
attempted to predict PSL for all proteins in GE-
NIA corpus by two existing sequence-based meth-
ods: WoLF PSORT (Horton et al., 2006) and SOSUI
(Hirokawa et al., 1998). Approximately 14% of pro-
tein names in GENIA corpus obtained results. From
the sequences, we used two features: (1) existence
of the sequence-based results, and (2) the number of
sequence-based results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980404761905">
The proposed approach has integrated text and
sequence-based approaches. To evaluate the system,
we performed 10-fold cross validation using 864 co-
occurrences including positive, negative, and neutral
relations. We measured the precision, recall, and
F-score of the system for all experiments. Among
864 co-occurrences in GENIA corpus, 301 positive
or negative co-occurrences have been considered as
relevant relations, and the remaining 563 neutral re-
lations have been considered as irrelevant relations.
Four approaches have been compared based on
three locations in Table 1. The four approaches are
baseline, text-based approach, sequence-based ap-
proach, and integration of the text and sequence-
based approaches. Baseline experiment used an as-
sumption: there is a relevant relation if a protein and
a cellular component names occur together in a co-
occurrence. The three locations selected when there
are the sequence-based results and the number of rel-
evant relations is more than one. All experiments
showed that the integration of text and sequence-
based approaches is the best, even though the exper-
iments for Cytoplasm showed the best performance
at both the text-based approach and the integration
approach.
A new prediction method has been developed for
protein sub-cellular localization, and it has integrated
text and sequence-based approach using an ML tech-
nique. The traditional NLP techniques contributed
to improve performance of the text-based approach,
and the text and sequence-based approaches recipro-
cally contributed to obtain a improved PSL predic-
tion method. The newly constructed corpus will be
included in the next version of GENIA corpus. There
are weak points in the proposed approach. The cur-
rent evaluation method has been focusing on eval-
uating the text-based approach, and the results of
the sequence-based approach were obtained for only
14% of proteins in GENIA corpus, so these situations
might be the reason that the sequence-based approach
did contribute a little. Thus, we need to evaluate the
proposed approach with a more reasonable method.
