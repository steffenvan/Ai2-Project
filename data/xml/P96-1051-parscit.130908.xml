This paper presents •a method for word
sense disambiguation and coherence under-
standing of prepositional relations. The
method relies on information provided by
WordNet 1.5. We first classify preposi-
tional attachments according to semantic
equivalence of phrase heads and then ap-
ply inferential heuristics for understanding

<bodyText confidence="0.999953">
In this paper, we address the problem of disam-
biguation and understanding prepositional attach-
ment. The arguments of prepositional relations are
automatically categorized into semantically equiva-
lent classes of WordNet (Miller and Teibel, 1991)
concepts. Then by applying inferential heuristics
on each class, we establish semantic connections be-
tween arguments that explain the validity of that
prepositional structure. The method uses informa-
tion provided by WordNet, such as semantic rela-
tions and textual glosses.
We have collected prepositional relations from the
Wall Street Journal tagged articles of the PENN
TREEBANK. Here, we focus on preposition of, the
most frequently used preposition in the corpus.

2 Classes of prepositional relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998844777777778">
Since most of the prepositional attachments obey
the principle of locality (Wertmer, 1991), we consid-
ered only the case of prepositional phrases preceded
by noun or verb phrases. We scanned the corpus
and filtered the phrase heads to create C, an ad hoc
collection of sequences &lt; noun prep noun &gt; and &lt;
verb prep noun &gt;. This collection is divided into
classes of prepositional relations, using the following
definitions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95316025">
Definition 1: Two prepositional structures &lt; nouni
prep noun2 &gt; and &lt; noun3 prep noun,&apos; &gt; belong
to the same class if one of the following conditions
holds:
• nouni, and noun2 are hypernym/hyponym of
noun3, and noun4 respectively, or
• nouni, and noun2 have a common hyper-
nym/hyponym and with noun3, and noun4, re-
spectively.
A particular case is when nouni (noun2) and
noun3 (noun4) are synonyms.
Definition 2: Two prepositional structures &lt;
verbi prep noun). &gt; and &lt; verb2 prep noun2 &gt; be-
long to the same class if one of the following condi-
tions holds:
• verbi , and nouni are hypernym/hyponym of
verb2, and noun2, respectively or
• verbi, and nouni have a common hyper-
nym/hyponym with verb2, and noun2, respec-
tively.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999072">
A particular case is when the verbs or the nouns
are synonyms, respectively.
The main benefit and reason for grouping prepo-
sitional relations into classes is the possibility to
disambiguate the words surrounding prepositions.
When classes of prepositional structures are iden-
tified, two possibilities arise:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.919462153846154">
1. A class contains at least two prepositional se-
quences from the collection C. In this case, all
sequences in that class are disambiguated, be-
cause for each pair (&lt; nouni prep nouni &gt; ,
&lt; nounk prep nounq &gt;), nouni and nounk (and
nouni and nounq respectively) are in one of the
following relations:
(a) they are synonyms, and point to one synset
that is their meaning.
(b) they belong to synsets that are in hyper-
nym/hyponym relation.
(c) they belong to synsets that have a common
hypernym/hyponym.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999187">
In cases (a), (b) and (c), since words are as-
sociated to synsets, their meanings are disam-
biguated. The same applies for classes of prepo-
sitional sequences &lt; verb prep noun &gt;.

2. A class contains only one sequence. We dis-
regard these classes from our study, since in
this class it is not possible to disambiguate the
words.
The collection C has 9511 &lt; noun of noun &gt; se-
quences, out of which 2158 have at least one of the
nouns tagged as a proper noun. 602 of these se-
quences have both nouns tagged as proper nouns.
Due to the fact that WordNet&apos;s coverage of proper
nouns is rather sparse, only 34% of these sequences
were disambiguated. Successful cases are &lt; House
of Representatives &gt;, &lt; University of Pennsylvania
&gt; or &lt; Museum of Art &gt;. Sequences that couldn&apos;t
be disambiguated comprise &lt; Aerospaciale of France
&gt; or &lt; Kennedy of Massachusetts &gt;. A small dis-
ambiguation rate of 28% covers the rest of the 1566
sequences relating a proper noun to a common noun.
A successful disambiguation occurred for &lt; hun-
dreds of Californians &gt; or &lt; corporation of Vancou-
ver &gt;. Sequences like &lt; aftermath of Iran-Contra
&gt; or &lt; acquisition of Merryl Linch &gt; weren&apos;t dis-
ambiguated. The results of the disambiguation of
the rest of 7353 sequences comprising only common
nouns are more encouraging. A total of 473 classes
were devised, out of which 131 had only one ele-
ment, yielding a disambiguation rate of 72.3%. The
number of elements in a class varies from 2 to 68.
Now that we found disambiguated classes of
prepositional structures, we provide some heuristics
to better understand why the prepositional relations
are valid. These heuristics are possible inferences
performed on WordNet.

3 Selectional Heuristics on WordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904868421053">
In this section we focus on semantic connections be-
tween the words of prepositional structures. Con-
sider for example acquisition of company. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates some of the relevant semantic con-
nections that can be drawn from WordNet when an-
alyzing this prepositional structure.
We note that noun acquisition is semantically
connected to the verb acquire, which is related to
the concept { buy, purchase, take}, a hypernym
of { take over, buy out}. Typical objects for buy
out are corporations and companies, both hyper-
nyms of concern. Thus, at a more abstract level, we
understand acquisition of company as an action
performed on a typical object. Such relations hold
for an entire class of prepositional structures.
What we want is to have a mechanism that ex-
tracts the essence of such semantic connections, and
be able to provide the inference that the elements of
this class are all sequences of &lt; noun i prep nounj &gt;,
with nouni always an object of the action described
by nouns.
Our approach to establish semantic paths is based
on inferential heuristics on WordNet. Using sev-
eral heuristics one can find common properties of
a prepositional class. The classification procedure
disambiguates both nouns as follows: the word
acquisition has four senses in WordNet , but it is
found in its synset number 1. The word company
appears in its synset number 1. The gloss of
acquisition satisfies the prerequisite of HR1:
Heuristic Rule 1 (HR1) If the textual gloss of
a noun concept begins with the expression the act
of followed by the gerund of a verb, then the respec-
tive noun concept describes an action represented by
the verb from the gloss.
This heuristic applies 831 times in WordNet,
showing that nouns like accomplishment, dispatch
or subsidization describe actions.

6 N2 describes the action with the theme Ni allegations of fraud
7 Ni is the location of the activity described by N2 place of business

<bodyText confidence="0.999681">
Thus acquisition is a description of any of the
verbal expressions contract possession, assume
possession and acquire possession.
The role of company is recovered using another
heuristic:
Heuristic Rule 2 (HR2) The gloss of a verb may
contain multiple textual explanations for that con-
cept, which are separated by semicolons. If one such
explanation takes one of the forms:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999967">
• of nouni
• of nouni and noun2
• of nouni or noun2
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99800496875">
then nouni and noun2 respectively are objects of
that verb.
Heuristic HR2 applies 134 times in WordNet,
providing objects for such verbs as generalize,
exfoliate or laicize.
The noun company is recognized as an object
of the synset {take over, buy out}, and so is
corporation. Both of them are hyponyms of
{business, concern, business concern}, which
fills in the object role of {business, concern,
business concern}. Because of that, both
company and corporation from the gloss of {take
over, buy out} are disambiguated and point to
their first corresponding synsets. Due to the in-
heritance property, company is an object of any hy-
pernyms of {take over, buy out}. One such hy-
pernym, {buy, purchase, take} also meets the re-
quirements of HR3:
Heuristic Rule 3 (HR3) If a verb concept has
another verb at the beginning of its gloss, then that
verb describes the same action, but in a more specific
context.
Therefore, acquire is a definition of {buy,
purchase, take}, that has company as an object
and involves a financial transaction. These three
heuristics operate throughout all the sequences of
the class comprising &lt; acquisition of company &gt;, &lt;
addition of business &gt;3 &lt; formation of group &gt; or
&lt; beginning of service &gt;
We conclude that for this class of prepositional
relations, noun2 is the object of the action described
by noun.

This paper proposes a method of extracting and val-
idating semantic relations for prepositional attach-
ment. The method is appealing because it uses
WordNet (which is publicly available and applicable
to broad English) and is scalable. A plausible expla-
nation of prepositional attachment may be provided
and the lexical disambiguation of the phrase heads
is possible. The method may be improved by us-
ing additional attachment locations as provided by
the transformations proposed in (Brill and Resnik,
1994).
