Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.996987">
The aim of this paper is to present
a language-neutral, theory-neutral
method for annotating sentence-
internal temporal relations. The
annotation method is simple and
can be applied without special
training. The annotations are
provided with a well-defined
model-theoretic interpretation for
use in the content-based
comparison of annotations.
Temporally annotated corpora
have a number of applications, in
lexicon/induction, translation and
linguistic investigation. A
searchable multi-language
database has already been created.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995956">
In interpreting narratives the most essential
information to be extracted is who did what
where, when and why, the classic journalistic
imperatives. The ‘who’ and ‘what’ information
is usually expressed overtly, and this has made it
possible to apply empirical techniques to
problems in this domain (such as word-sense
classification and argument structure mapping).
The ‘when’ and ‘where’ information is,
however, often left implicit, or, at least, only
partially specified, making it difficlut to apply
such techniques to this domain.
Formal semantic theories of temporal
interpretation (e.g. Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993;
Ogihara 1996; Abusch 1997) have been quite
successful at specifying the contribution that
such overt markers as tenses and temporal
adverbials make to the meaning of a sentence or
discourse. Investigations into the interpretation
of narrative discourse (Lascarides &amp; Asher
1993, Reyle &amp; Rossdeutscher 2000) have,
however, shown that very specific lexical
information plays an important role in
determining temporal interpretation. As of yet it
is not clear how this kind of lexical information
could be automatically acquired. The most
promising avenue for acquiring lexical
information appears to be automatic induction
from very large annotated corpora (Rooth, et. al.
1998). In order to apply these techniques to the
temporal domain it is necessary that the
temporal information be made explicit. Our task
here is to provide a system of temporal
annotation that fulfills this requirement.
The systems for temporal annotation we are
familiar with have been concerned either with
absolute temporal information (Wiebe, et. al.
1998, Androutsopoulos, Rithie &amp; Thanisch
1997), or with the annotation of overt markers
(Setzer &amp; Gaizauskas 2000). Much temporal
information, however, is not absolute but
relative and not overtly marked but implicit. We
are frequently only interested (and only have
information about) the order events occurred in.
And while there are sometimes overt markers
for these temporal relations, the conjunctions
before, after and when being the most obvious,
usually this kind of relational information is
implicit. The examples in (1) illustrate the
phenomenon.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9016045">
(1) a. John kissed the girl he met at the party.
b. Leaving the party, John walked home.
c. He remembered talking to her and asking
her for her name.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401684210526">
Although there are no obvious markers for the
temporal ordering of the events described in
these sentences, native speakers have clear
intuitions about what happened when: we know
that the kissing took place after the meeting and
that the asking was part of the talking. But how
do we know this? And – more importantly –
how could this information be automatically
extracted from these sentences? These are the
questions that motivate the development of our
annotation system.
We believe that the creation of a large scale
treebank annotated with relational temporal
information as well as standard morphological
and syntactic information will make it possible
to investigate these issues productively. The
annotated treebank must be large scale for the
obvious reason that the application of stochastic
methods requires this. It should be syntactically
as well as semantically annotated because we
consider it quite likely that syntactic as well as
lexical information plays a role in temporal
interpretation. We don’t know a priori whether
in (1a) it is the lexical relationship between kiss
and meet that is crucial to determining the
temporal interpretation, or whether the fact that
meet is in a subordinate clause – the syntactic
relation – also plays a role. To answer these
kinds of questions it is necessary to encode the
temporal information conveyed by a sentence in
a way which makes addressing such questions
possible.
What we describe below is a practical system
for encoding relational temporal information
that is suited to large-scale hand annotation of
texts. This system has a number of applications
beyond this, both in the domain of cross-
linguistic investigation and in empirical NLP.

2 Temporal annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997549576271186">
The idea of developing a treebank enriched with
semantic information is not new. In particular
such semantically annotated corpora have been
used in research on word sense disambiguation
(wordNet, Eagles, Simple) and semantics role
interpretation (Eagles). The public availability
of large syntactically annotated treebanks (Penn,
Yerbmobil, Negra) makes such work attractive,
particularly in light of the success that empirical
methods have had (Kilgarriff &amp; Rosenzweig
2000). Traditional semantic representational
formalisms such as DRT (Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993)
are ill suited to semantic annotation. Since these
formalisms are developed in the service of
theories of natural language interpretation, they
are – rightly – both highly articulated and highly
constrained. In short, they are often too complex
and sometimes not expressive enough for the
purposes at hand (as the experience of Poesio et.
al. (1999) makes clear). Our proposal here is to
adopt a radically simplified semantic formalism
which, by virtue of its simplicity, is suited the
temporal-annotation application.
The temporal interpretation of a sentence, for
our purposes, can simply be taken to be the set
of temporal relations that a speaker naturally
takes to hold among the states and events
described by the verbs of the sentence. To put it
more formally, we associate with each verb a
temporal interval, and concern ourselves with
relations among these intervals. Of the interval
relations discussed by Allen (1984), we will be
concerned with only two: precedence and
inclusion. Taking ttalk to be the time of talking
task to be the time of asking and tremember to be the
time of remembering, the temporal
interpretation (1c), for example, can be given by
the following table:
ttalk task tremember
ttalk &lt;
task ⊆ &lt;
tremember
Such a table, in effect, stores the native
speaker’s judgement about the most natural
temporal interpretation of the sentence.
Since our goal was to annotate a large number of
sentences with their temporal interpretations,
with the goal of examining the interaction
between the lexical and syntactic structure, it
was imperative that the interpretation be closely
tied to its syntactic context. We needed to keep
track of both the semantic relations among times
referred to by the words in a sentence and the
syntactic relations among the words in the
sentences that refer to these times, but not much
more. By adopting existing technology for
syntactic annotation, we were able do this quite
directly, by essentially building the information
in this table into the syntax.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995719">
2.1 The annotation system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984252724137931">
To carry out our temporal annotation, we made
use of the Annotate tool for syntactic annotation
developed in Saarbrücken by Brants and Plaehn
(2000). We exploited an aspect of the system
originally designed for the annotation of
anaphoric relations: the ability to link two
arbitrary nodes in a syntactic structure by means
of labeled “secondary edges.” This allowed us to
add a layer of semantic annotation directly to
that of syntactic annotation.
A sentence was temporally annotated by linking
the verbs in the sentence via secondary edges
labeled with the appropriate temporal relation.
As we were initially only concerned with the
relations of precedence and inclusion, we only
had four labels: “&lt;” , “⊆”, and their duals.
Sentence (1a), then, is annotated as in (2).
(2)
The natural ordering relation between the
kissing and the meeting is indicated by the
labeled edge. Note that the edge goes from the
verb associated with the event that fills the first
argument of the relation to the verb associated
with the event that fills the second argument of
the relation.
The annotation of (1c), which was somewhat
more complex, indicates the two relations that
hold among the events described by the
sentence.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932221">
(3) He remembered talking and asking her name
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996985">
In addition to encoding the relations among the
events described in a sentence, we anticipated
that it would be useful to encode also the
relationship between these events and the time at
which the sentence is produced. This is, after all,
what tenses usually convey. To encode this
temporal indexical information, we introduce
into the annotation an explicit representation of
the speech time. This is indicated by the “ ° ”
symbol, which is automatically prefaced to all
sentences prior to annotation.
The complete annotation for sentence (1a), then,
is (4).
As we see in (5), this coding scheme enables us
to represent the different interpretations that past
tensed and present tensed clauses have.
Notice that we do not annotate the tenses
themselves directly.
Note that in the case of reported speech, the time
associated with the embedding verb plays, for
the embedded sentence, much the same role that
the speech time plays for the main clause.
Formally, in fact, the relational analysis implicit
in our notation makes it possible to avoid many
of the problems associated with the treatment of
these constructions (such as those discussed at
length by von Stechow (1995)). We set these
issues aside here.
It should be clear that we are not concerned with
giving a semantics for temporal markers, but
rather with providing a language within which
we can describe the temporal information
conveyed by natural language sentences. With
the addition of temporal indexical annotation,
our annotation system gains enough expressive
power to account for most of the relational
information conveyed by natural language
sentences. Left out at this point is temporal-
metrical information such as that conveyed by
the adverbial “two hours later.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99973">
2.2 Annotation procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9862354">
The annotation procedure itself is quite
straightforward. We begin with a syntactically
annotated treebank and add the speech time
marker to each of the sentences. The annotator
then simply marks the temporal relations among
verbs and the speech time for each sentence in
the corpus. This is accomplished in accordance
with the following conventions:
(i) temporal relations are encoded with
directed “secondary edges”;
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.994039333333333">
&gt;

</figure>
<listItem confidence="0.957901">
(ii) the edge goes from the element that fills
the first argument of the relation to the
element that fills the second;
(iii) edge labels indicate the temporal relation
that holds;
(iv) edge labels can be “&gt;”, “&lt;”, “❑” and “❑”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855">
Annotators are instructed to annotate the
sentences as they naturally understand them.
When the treebank is made up of a sequence of
connected text, the annotators are encouraged to
make use of contextual information.
The annotation scheme is simple, explicit and
theory neutral. The annotator needs only to
exercise his native competence in his language
and he doesn’t need any special training in
temporal semantics or in any specific formal
language; in pilot studies we have assembled
small temporal annotated databases in few
hours. Our current database consists of 300
sentences from six languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999703">
2.3 Comparing annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945661265306122">
It is well known that hand-annotated corpora are
prone to inconsistency (Marcus, Santorini &amp;
Marcinkiewicz, 1993) and to that end it is
desirable that the corpus be multiply annotated
by different annotators and that these
annotations be compared. The kind of semantic
annotation we are proposing here introduces an
additional complexity to inter-annotation
comparison, in that the consistency of an
annotation is best defined not in formal terms
but in semantic terms. Two annotations should
be taken to be equivalent, for example, if they
express the same meanings, even if they use
different sets of labeled edges.
To make explicit what semantic identity is, we
provide our annotations with a model theoretic
interpretation. The annotations are interpreted
with respect to a structure D,&lt;,❑ , where D is
the domain (here the set of verbs tokens in the
corpus) and &lt; and ❑ are binary relations on D.
Models for this structure are assignments of
pairs of entities in D to &lt; and ❑ satisfying the
following axioms:
- ❑x,y,z. x&lt;y &amp; y&lt;z ❑ x&lt;z
- ❑x,y,z. x❑y &amp; y❑z ❑ x❑z
- ❑w,x,y,z. x&lt;y &amp; z❑x &amp; w❑y ❑ z&lt;w
- ❑w,x,y,z. x&lt;y &amp; y&lt;z &amp; x ❑w &amp; z❑w ❑ y❑w
Thus &lt; and ❑ have the properties one would
expect for the precedence and inclusion relation.
We are assuming that in the cases of interest
verbs refer to simply convex events. Intuitively,
the set of verb tokens in the corpus corresponds
the set of times at which an event or state of the
type indicated by the verb takes place or holds.
In our corpus the number of sentences that
involved quantified or generic event reference
was quite low.
An annotated relation of the following form
is satisfied in a model iff the model assigns
&lt;X1,X2&gt; to R if R is &lt; or ❑, or &lt;X2,X1&gt; to R if
R is &gt; or ❑. A sentence is satisfied by a model
iff all relations associated with the sentence are
satisfied by the model. Intuitively an annotated
is satisfied by a model if the model assigns the
appropriate relation to the verbs occurring in the
sentence.
There are four semantic relations that can hold
among between annotations. These can be
defined in model-theoretic terms:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99955625">
❑ Annotation A and B are equivalent if all
models satisfying A satisfy B and all models
satisfying B satisfy A.
❑ Annotation A subsumes annotation B iff all
models satisfying B satisfy A.
❑ Annotations A and B are consistent iff there
are models satisfying both A and B.
❑ Annotations A and B are inconsistent if
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9951114">
there are no models satisfying both A and B.
We can also define the minimal model satisfying
an annotation in the usual way. We can then
compute a distance measure between two
annotations by comparing set of models
satisfying the annotations. Let MA be the models
satisfying A and MB be those satisfying B and
MAB be those satisfying both (simply shorthand
for the intersection of MA and MB). Then the
distance between A and B can be defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.935088">
d(A,B) = (|MA- MAB |+ |MB-MAB|)/ |MAB|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999400333333333">
In other words, the distance is the number of
relation pairs that are not shared by the
annotations normalized by the number that they
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.985321">
R
X1 X2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9050176">
do share. We can use this metric to quantify the
“goodness” of both annotations and annotators.
Consider again (1c). We gave one annotation for
this in (3). In (6) and (7) there are two
alternative annotations.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998902">
(6) He remembered talking and asking her name
(7) He remembered talking and asking her name
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999689333333333">
As we can compute on the basis of the semantics
for the annotations (6) is equivalent with (3) –
they are no distance apart, while (7) is
inconsistent with (3) – they are infinitely far
apart. The annotation (8) is compatible (7) and is
a distance of 1 away from it.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.897081">
(8) He remembered talking and asking her name
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982777777778">
As in the case of structural annotation, there are
a number of ways of resolving inter-annotator
variation. We can chose the most informative
annotation as the correct one, or the most
general. Or we can combine annotations. The
intersection of two compatible annotations gives
an equally compatible annotation which contains
more information than either of the two alone.
We do not, as of yet, have enough data to
determine which of these strategies is most
effective.
In preliminary work, we had two annotators
annotate 50 complex sentences extracted
randomly from the BNC. The results were quite
encouraging. Although the annotations were
identical in only 70% of the cases, the
annotations were semantically consistent in 85%
of the cases.

3 Applications of temporal
annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999758692307692">
There are any number of applications for a
temporally annotated corpus such as that we
have been outlining. Lexicon induction is the
most interesting, but, as we indicated at the
outset, this is a long-term project, as it requires a
significant investment in hand annotation. We
hope to get around this problem. But even still,
there are a number of other applications which
require less extensive corpora, but which are of
significant interest. One of these has formed the
initial focus of our research, and this is the
development of a searchable multilingual
database.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999808">
3.1 Multilingual database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999766">
Our annotation method has been applied to
sentences from a variety of languages, creating a
searchable multi-language treebank. This
database allows us to search for sentences that
express a given temporal relation in a language.
We have already developed a pilot multilingual
database with sentences from the Yerbmobil
database (see an example in fig. 1) and we have
developed a query procedure in order to extract
relevant information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.551789">

<bodyText confidence="0.999861285714286">
As can be seen, the temporal annotation is
entirely independent of the syntactic annotation.
In the context of the Annotate environment a
number of tools have been developed (and are
under development) for the querying of
structural relations. Since each sentence is stored
in the relational database with both syntactic and
temporal semantic annotations, it is possible to
make use of these querying tools to query on
structures, on meanings, and on structures and
meanings together. For example a query such as:
“Find the sentences containing a relative clause
which is interpreted as temporally overlapping
the main clause” can be processed. This query is

encoded as a partially specified tree, as indicated
below:
In this structure, both the syntactic configuration
of the relative clause and the temporal relations
between the matrix verb and the speech time and
between the matrix verb and the verb occurring
in the relative clause are represented. Querying
our temporally annotated treebank with this
request yields the following result:
The application to cross-linguistic research
should be clear. It is now possible to use the
annotated tree-bank as an informant by storing
the linguistically relevant aspects of the
temporal system of a language in a compact
searchable database.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997952">
3.2 Aid for translation technology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937666666667">
Another potential application of the annotation
system is as an aid to automatic translation
systems. That the behaviour of tenses differ
from language to language makes the translation
of tenses difficult. In particular, the application
of example-based techniques faces serious
difficulties (Arnold, et. al. 1994). Adding the
intended temporal relation to the database of
source sentences makes it possible to moderate
this problem.
For example in Japanese (9a) is properly
translated as (10a) on one reading, where the
embedded past tense is translated as a present
tense, but as (10b) on the other, where the verb
is translated as a past tense.

lit: Bernard said Junko was sick.
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.997986">
Only the intended reading can distinguish these
two translations. If this is encoded as part of the
input, we can hope to achieve much more
reasonable output.

3.3 Extracting cues for temporal
interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962319342857143">
While we see this sort of cross-linguistic
investigation as of intrinsic interest, our real
goal is the investigation of the lexical and
grammatical cues for temporal interpretation. As
already mentioned, the biggest problem is one of
scale. Generating a temporally annotated
treebank of the size needed is a serious
undertaking.
It would, of course, be of great help to be able to
partially automate this task. To that end we are
currently engaged in research attempting to use
overt cues such as perfect marking and temporal
conjunctions such as before and after to
bootstrap our way towards a temporally
annotated corpus. Briefly, the idea is to use
these overt markers to tag a corpus directly and
to use this to generate a table of lexical
preferences. So, for example, the sentence (11)
can be tagged automatically, because of the
presence of the perfect marking.
This automatic tagging will allow us to assemble
an initial data set of lexical preferences, such as
that that would appear to hold between kiss and
meet. If this initial data is confirmed by
comparison with hand-tagged data, we can use
&gt;
&gt;
° John kissed the girl he had met
(11)
this information to automatically annotate a
much larger corpus based on these lexical
preferences. It may then be possible to begin to
carry out the investigation of cues to temporal
interpretation before we have constructed a large
hand-coded temporally annotated treebank.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999468">
We have described a simple and general
technique for the annotation of relational
temporal information in naturally occurring
sentences. This annotation system is intended
for use in the large-scale annotation of corpora.
The annotations are provided with a model
theoretic semantics. This semantics provides the
basis for a content-based system for comparing
and evaluating inter-annotator agreement.
Temporally annotated corpora such as those we
are developing have a number of applications in
both corpus-based theoretical work, and in
practical applications. Of particular interest to us
is the promise such annotated databases bring to
the problem of extracting automatically lexical
information about stereotypical ordering
relations among events that are used by native
speakers to interpret sentences temporally. We
see this application as the main future research
to be carried out.

<abstract confidence="0.990253491712709">The aim of this paper is to present a language-neutral, theory-neutral method for annotating sentenceinternal temporal relations. The annotation method is simple and can be applied without special training. The annotations are provided with a well-defined model-theoretic interpretation for use in the content-based comparison of annotations. Temporally annotated corpora have a number of applications, in lexicon/induction, translation and linguistic investigation. A searchable database has already been created. In interpreting narratives the most essential information to be extracted is who did what where, when and why, the classic journalistic imperatives. The ‘who’ and ‘what’ information is usually expressed overtly, and this has made it possible to apply empirical techniques to problems in this domain (such as word-sense classification and argument structure mapping). The ‘when’ and ‘where’ information is, however, often left implicit, or, at least, only partially specified, making it difficlut to apply such techniques to this domain. Formal semantic theories of temporal interpretation (e.g. Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993; Ogihara 1996; Abusch 1997) have been quite successful at specifying the contribution that such overt markers as tenses and temporal adverbials make to the meaning of a sentence or discourse. Investigations into the interpretation of narrative discourse (Lascarides &amp; Asher 1993, Reyle &amp; Rossdeutscher 2000) have, however, shown that very specific lexical information plays an important role in determining temporal interpretation. As of yet it is not clear how this kind of lexical information could be automatically acquired. The most promising avenue for acquiring lexical information appears to be automatic induction from very large annotated corpora (Rooth, et. al. 1998). In order to apply these techniques to the temporal domain it is necessary that the temporal information be made explicit. Our task here is to provide a system of temporal annotation that fulfills this requirement. The systems for temporal annotation we are familiar with have been concerned either with absolute temporal information (Wiebe, et. al. 1998, Androutsopoulos, Rithie &amp; Thanisch 1997), or with the annotation of overt markers (Setzer &amp; Gaizauskas 2000). Much temporal information, however, is not absolute but relative and not overtly marked but implicit. We are frequently only interested (and only have information about) the order events occurred in. And while there are sometimes overt markers for these temporal relations, the conjunctions the most obvious, usually this kind of relational information is implicit. The examples in (1) illustrate the phenomenon. (1) a. John kissed the girl he met at the party. b. Leaving the party, John walked home. c. He remembered talking to her and asking her for her name. Although there are no obvious markers for the temporal ordering of the events described in these sentences, native speakers have clear intuitions about what happened when: we know that the kissing took place after the meeting and that the asking was part of the talking. But how do we know this? And – more importantly – how could this information be automatically extracted from these sentences? These are the questions that motivate the development of our annotation system. We believe that the creation of a large scale treebank annotated with relational temporal information as well as standard morphological and syntactic information will make it possible to investigate these issues productively. The annotated treebank must be large scale for the obvious reason that the application of stochastic methods requires this. It should be syntactically as well as semantically annotated because we consider it quite likely that syntactic as well as lexical information plays a role in temporal We don’t know priori (1a) it is the lexical relationship between is crucial to determining the temporal interpretation, or whether the fact that in a subordinate clause – the syntactic relation – also plays a role. To answer these kinds of questions it is necessary to encode the temporal information conveyed by a sentence in a way which makes addressing such questions possible. What we describe below is a practical system for encoding relational temporal information that is suited to large-scale hand annotation of texts. This system has a number of applications beyond this, both in the domain of crosslinguistic investigation and in empirical NLP. annotation The idea of developing a treebank enriched with semantic information is not new. In particular such semantically annotated corpora have been used in research on word sense disambiguation Eagles, Simple) semantics role The public availability large syntactically annotated treebanks makes such work attractive, particularly in light of the success that empirical methods have had (Kilgarriff &amp; Rosenzweig 2000). Traditional semantic representational formalisms such as DRT (Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993) are ill suited to semantic annotation. Since these formalisms are developed in the service of theories of natural language interpretation, they are – rightly – both highly articulated and highly constrained. In short, they are often too complex and sometimes not expressive enough for the purposes at hand (as the experience of Poesio et. al. (1999) makes clear). Our proposal here is to adopt a radically simplified semantic formalism which, by virtue of its simplicity, is suited the temporal-annotation application. The temporal interpretation of a sentence, for our purposes, can simply be taken to be the set of temporal relations that a speaker naturally takes to hold among the states and events described by the verbs of the sentence. To put it more formally, we associate with each verb a temporal interval, and concern ourselves with relations among these intervals. Of the interval relations discussed by Allen (1984), we will be concerned with only two: precedence and Taking to be the time of talking be the time of asking and to be the time of remembering, the temporal interpretation (1c), for example, can be given by the following table: &lt; ⊆ &lt; Such a table, in effect, stores the native speaker’s judgement about the most natural temporal interpretation of the sentence. Since our goal was to annotate a large number of sentences with their temporal interpretations, with the goal of examining the interaction between the lexical and syntactic structure, it was imperative that the interpretation be closely tied to its syntactic context. We needed to keep track of both the semantic relations among times referred to by the words in a sentence and the syntactic relations among the words in the sentences that refer to these times, but not much more. By adopting existing technology for syntactic annotation, we were able do this quite directly, by essentially building the information in this table into the syntax. 2.1 The annotation system To carry out our temporal annotation, we made of the for syntactic annotation developed in Saarbrücken by Brants and Plaehn (2000). We exploited an aspect of the system originally designed for the annotation of anaphoric relations: the ability to link two arbitrary nodes in a syntactic structure by means of labeled “secondary edges.” This allowed us to add a layer of semantic annotation directly to that of syntactic annotation. A sentence was temporally annotated by linking the verbs in the sentence via secondary edges labeled with the appropriate temporal relation. As we were initially only concerned with the relations of precedence and inclusion, we only four labels: “&lt;” , and their duals. Sentence (1a), then, is annotated as in (2). (2) The natural ordering relation between the kissing and the meeting is indicated by the labeled edge. Note that the edge goes from the verb associated with the event that fills the first argument of the relation to the verb associated with the event that fills the second argument of the relation. The annotation of (1c), which was somewhat more complex, indicates the two relations that hold among the events described by the sentence. (3) He remembered talking and asking her name In addition to encoding the relations among the events described in a sentence, we anticipated that it would be useful to encode also the relationship between these events and the time at which the sentence is produced. This is, after all, what tenses usually convey. To encode this temporal indexical information, we introduce into the annotation an explicit representation of the speech time. This is indicated by the “ ° ” symbol, which is automatically prefaced to all sentences prior to annotation. The complete annotation for sentence (1a), then, is (4). As we see in (5), this coding scheme enables us to represent the different interpretations that past tensed and present tensed clauses have. Notice that we do not annotate the tenses themselves directly. Note that in the case of reported speech, the time associated with the embedding verb plays, for the embedded sentence, much the same role that the speech time plays for the main clause. Formally, in fact, the relational analysis implicit in our notation makes it possible to avoid many of the problems associated with the treatment of these constructions (such as those discussed at length by von Stechow (1995)). We set these issues aside here. It should be clear that we are not concerned with giving a semantics for temporal markers, but rather with providing a language within which we can describe the temporal information conveyed by natural language sentences. With the addition of temporal indexical annotation, our annotation system gains enough expressive power to account for most of the relational information conveyed by natural language sentences. Left out at this point is temporalmetrical information such as that conveyed by the adverbial “two hours later.” 2.2 Annotation procedure The annotation procedure itself is quite straightforward. We begin with a syntactically annotated treebank and add the speech time marker to each of the sentences. The annotator then simply marks the temporal relations among verbs and the speech time for each sentence in the corpus. This is accomplished in accordance with the following conventions: (i) temporal relations are encoded with directed “secondary edges”; &gt; ⊇ ° John kissed the girl he met at the party &gt; &gt; &gt; ⊆ ° John kissed the girl who is at the party &gt; John kissed the girl he met at the party (4) (5) (ii) the edge goes from the element that fills the first argument of the relation to the element that fills the second; (iii) edge labels indicate the temporal relation that holds; edge labels can be “&gt;”, “&lt;”, and Annotators are instructed to annotate the sentences as they naturally understand them. When the treebank is made up of a sequence of connected text, the annotators are encouraged to make use of contextual information. The annotation scheme is simple, explicit and theory neutral. The annotator needs only to exercise his native competence in his language and he doesn’t need any special training in temporal semantics or in any specific formal language; in pilot studies we have assembled small temporal annotated databases in few hours. Our current database consists of 300 sentences from six languages. 2.3 Comparing annotations It is well known that hand-annotated corpora are prone to inconsistency (Marcus, Santorini &amp; Marcinkiewicz, 1993) and to that end it is desirable that the corpus be multiply annotated by different annotators and that these annotations be compared. The kind of semantic annotation we are proposing here introduces an additional complexity to inter-annotation comparison, in that the consistency of an annotation is best defined not in formal terms but in semantic terms. Two annotations should be taken to be equivalent, for example, if they express the same meanings, even if they use different sets of labeled edges. To make explicit what semantic identity is, we provide our annotations with a model theoretic interpretation. The annotations are interpreted respect to a structure where D is the domain (here the set of verbs tokens in the and &lt; and binary relations on D. Models for this structure are assignments of of entities in D to &lt; and the following axioms: x&lt;y &amp; y&lt;z &amp; x&lt;y &amp; &amp; x&lt;y &amp; y&lt;z &amp; x &amp; &lt; and the properties one would expect for the precedence and inclusion relation. We are assuming that in the cases of interest verbs refer to simply convex events. Intuitively, the set of verb tokens in the corpus corresponds the set of times at which an event or state of the type indicated by the verb takes place or holds. In our corpus the number of sentences that involved quantified or generic event reference was quite low. An annotated relation of the following form is satisfied in a model iff the model assigns to R if R is &lt; or or to R if is &gt; or A sentence is satisfied by a model iff all relations associated with the sentence are satisfied by the model. Intuitively an annotated is satisfied by a model if the model assigns the appropriate relation to the verbs occurring in the sentence. There are four semantic relations that can hold among between annotations. These can be defined in model-theoretic terms: Annotation A and B are all models satisfying A satisfy B and all models satisfying B satisfy A. Annotation A B iff all models satisfying B satisfy A. Annotations A and B are there are models satisfying both A and B. Annotations A and B are there are no models satisfying both A and B. We can also define the minimal model satisfying an annotation in the usual way. We can then compute a distance measure between two annotations by comparing set of models the annotations. Let the models A and those satisfying B and those satisfying both (simply shorthand the intersection of Then the distance between A and B can be defined as: = + In other words, the distance is the number of relation pairs that are not shared by the annotations normalized by the number that they R do share. We can use this metric to quantify the “goodness” of both annotations and annotators. Consider again (1c). We gave one annotation for this in (3). In (6) and (7) there are two alternative annotations. (6) He remembered talking and asking her name (7) He remembered talking and asking her name As we can compute on the basis of the semantics for the annotations (6) is equivalent with (3) – they are no distance apart, while (7) is inconsistent with (3) – they are infinitely far apart. The annotation (8) is compatible (7) and is a distance of 1 away from it. (8) He remembered talking and asking her name As in the case of structural annotation, there are a number of ways of resolving inter-annotator variation. We can chose the most informative annotation as the correct one, or the most general. Or we can combine annotations. The intersection of two compatible annotations gives an equally compatible annotation which contains more information than either of the two alone. We do not, as of yet, have enough data to determine which of these strategies is most effective. In preliminary work, we had two annotators annotate 50 complex sentences extracted randomly from the BNC. The results were quite encouraging. Although the annotations were identical in only 70% of the cases, the annotations were semantically consistent in 85% of the cases. of temporal annotation There are any number of applications for a temporally annotated corpus such as that we have been outlining. Lexicon induction is the most interesting, but, as we indicated at the outset, this is a long-term project, as it requires a significant investment in hand annotation. We hope to get around this problem. But even still, there are a number of other applications which require less extensive corpora, but which are of significant interest. One of these has formed the initial focus of our research, and this is the development of a searchable multilingual database. 3.1 Multilingual database Our annotation method has been applied to sentences from a variety of languages, creating a searchable multi-language treebank. This database allows us to search for sentences that express a given temporal relation in a language. We have already developed a pilot multilingual with sentences from the database (see an example in fig. 1) and we have developed a query procedure in order to extract relevant information. A temporally annotated sentence from the treebank as displayed by As can be seen, the temporal annotation is entirely independent of the syntactic annotation. the context of the a number of tools have been developed (and are under development) for the querying of structural relations. Since each sentence is stored in the relational database with both syntactic and temporal semantic annotations, it is possible to make use of these querying tools to query on structures, on meanings, and on structures and meanings together. For example a query such as: “Find the sentences containing a relative clause which is interpreted as temporally overlapping the main clause” can be processed. This query is &gt; &gt; ⊇ &gt; &gt; &gt; [ST] VB VB S ADJ S HD ⊆ HD &gt; encoded as a partially specified tree, as indicated below: In this structure, both the syntactic configuration of the relative clause and the temporal relations between the matrix verb and the speech time and between the matrix verb and the verb occurring in the relative clause are represented. Querying our temporally annotated treebank with this request yields the following result: The application to cross-linguistic research should be clear. It is now possible to use the annotated tree-bank as an informant by storing the linguistically relevant aspects of the temporal system of a language in a compact searchable database. 3.2 Aid for translation technology Another potential application of the annotation system is as an aid to automatic translation systems. That the behaviour of tenses differ from language to language makes the translation of tenses difficult. In particular, the application of example-based techniques faces serious difficulties (Arnold, et. al. 1994). Adding the intended temporal relation to the database of source sentences makes it possible to moderate this problem. For example in Japanese (9a) is properly translated as (10a) on one reading, where the embedded past tense is translated as a present tense, but as (10b) on the other, where the verb is translated as a past tense. (9) a. Bernard said that Junko was sick (10)a. Bernard-wa Junko ga byookida to it-ta lit: Bernard said Junko is sick b. Bernard-wa Junko-ga byookidata to it-ta. lit: Bernard said Junko was sick. Only the intended reading can distinguish these two translations. If this is encoded as part of the input, we can hope to achieve much more reasonable output. 3.3 Extracting cues for temporal interpretation While we see this sort of cross-linguistic investigation as of intrinsic interest, our real goal is the investigation of the lexical and grammatical cues for temporal interpretation. As already mentioned, the biggest problem is one of scale. Generating a temporally annotated treebank of the size needed is a serious undertaking. It would, of course, be of great help to be able to partially automate this task. To that end we are currently engaged in research attempting to use overt cues such as perfect marking and temporal such as bootstrap our way towards a temporally annotated corpus. Briefly, the idea is to use these overt markers to tag a corpus directly and to use this to generate a table of lexical preferences. So, for example, the sentence (11) can be tagged automatically, because of the presence of the perfect marking. This automatic tagging will allow us to assemble an initial data set of lexical preferences, such as that would appear to hold between If this initial data is confirmed by comparison with hand-tagged data, we can use &gt; &gt; ° John kissed the girl he had met (11) this information to automatically annotate a much larger corpus based on these lexical preferences. It may then be possible to begin to carry out the investigation of cues to temporal interpretation before we have constructed a large hand-coded temporally annotated treebank. We have described a simple and general technique for the annotation of relational temporal information in naturally occurring sentences. This annotation system is intended for use in the large-scale annotation of corpora. The annotations are provided with a model theoretic semantics. This semantics provides the basis for a content-based system for comparing and evaluating inter-annotator agreement. Temporally annotated corpora such as those we are developing have a number of applications in both corpus-based theoretical work, and in practical applications. Of particular interest to us is the promise such annotated databases bring to the problem of extracting automatically lexical information about stereotypical ordering relations among events that are used by native speakers to interpret sentences temporally. We see this application as the main future research to be carried out.</abstract>

In order to apply these techniques to the temporal domain it is necessary that the temporal information be made explicit. Our task here is to provide a system of temporal annotation that fulfills this requirement. The systems for temporal annotation we are familiar with have been concerned either with absolute temporal information (Wiebe, et. al. 1998, Androutsopoulos, Rithie &amp; Thanisch 1997), or with the annotation of overt markers (Setzer &amp; Gaizauskas 2000). Much temporal information, however, is not absolute but relative and not overtly marked but implicit. We are frequently only interested (and only have information about) the order events occurred in. And while there are sometimes overt markers for these temporal relations, the conjunctions before, after and when being the most obvious, usually this kind of relational information is implicit. The examples in (1) illustrate the phenomenon. (1) a. John kissed the girl he met at the party. b. Leaving the party, John walked home. c. He remembered talking to her and asking her for her name.
