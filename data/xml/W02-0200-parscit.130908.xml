Continuing with a series of successful SIGdial workshops in Hong Kong and Denmark,
this workshop will span the ACL and ISCA SIGdial interest area of discourse and
dialogue. This series provides a regular forum for the presentation of research in this area
to both the larger SIGdial community as well as researchers outside this community. The
workshop is organized by SIGdial (http://www.sigdial.org) which is sponsored jointly by
ACL (http://www.aclweb.org) and ISCA (http://www.isca-speech.org).
The workshop includes a few plenary presentations of general interest along with three
thematic sessions. The thematic sessions will combine long presentations, short
presentations, and demos (as appropriate) with extended discussions. The three themes
for this workshop are:
•Annotation Methods for Corpora
•Architectures for Dialogue Systems: Agent-based vs. Pipelined
•Learning and Adaptivity in Dialogue Systems
We would like to thank our colleagues who acted as the programme committee members
and reviewed the submissions, thus helping us in deciding on the final programme.
