We report on a mechanism for semantic and prag-
matic interpretation that has been designed to
take advantage of the generally compositional na-
ture of semantic analysis, without unduly con-
straining the order in which pragmatic decisions
are made. To achieve this goal, we introduce the
idea of a conditional interpretation: one that de-
pends upon a set of assumptions about subsequent
pragmatic processing. Conditional interpretations
are constructed compositionally according to a set
of declaratively specified interpretation rules. The
mechanism can handle a wide range of pragmatic
phenomena and their interactions.

Compositional systems of semantic interpretation,
while logically and computationally very attrac-
tive [6,20,26], seem unable to cope with the fact
that the syntactic form of an utterance is not
the only source of information about its mean-
ing. Contextual information—information about
the world and about the history of a discourse—
influences not only an utterance&apos;s meaning, but
even its preferred syntactic analysis [3,5,7,16]. Of
course, context also influences the interpretation
(or meaning in context) of the utterance, in which,
for example, referring expressions have been re-
solved.
One possible solution is to move to an integrated
system of semantic and pragmatic interpretation,
defined recursively on syntactic analyses that are
This research has been funded by DARPA under Con-
tract N00039-84-C-0524, and by a gift from the Systems

formation, Stanford University. We would like to thank

neutral about those decisions that depend upon
context. In this approach, a least-commitment
grammar may be used to produce neutral repre-
sentations that can be reconfigured later. Such
a grammar might, for example, leave quantifiers
in place [30], attach all prepositional phrases low
and right [22], and bracket to the right all com-
pound nominals.2 These neutral analyses can then
serve as input to a system that produces inter-
pretations (and not meanings) in a nearly com-
positional manner, in that the interpretation of a
phrase3 is a function of the interpretations of its
syntactic constituents together with its context of
utterance.
This model of semantic interpretation assumes
that contextual information is available whenever
it is needed for deciding among alternative inter-
pretations. However, this is often not the case:
questions about the interpretation of some con-
stituent of an utterance might be answerable only
when information about the interpretation of syn-
tactically distant constituents becomes available.
Familiar examples of this can be found, for in-
stance, in sentences with quantifier scoping ambi-
guities and in sentences that include intrasenten-
tial anaphora. The so-called donkey sentences [9]
exhibit both these phenomena.
These difficulties do not necessitate a complete
abandonment of compositionality. To take advan-
tage of the generally compositional nature of se-
mantic analysis without constraining unduly the
order in which pragmatic decisions are made,
we assign to phrases conditional interpretations,
2There are reasons to suspect that ultimately syntactic
analysis should be incorporated into the same stage of pro-
cessing as semantic and pragmatic analysis; in particular, it
is difficult to develop syntactically neutral representations
for certain constructions such as conjunction.
3For simplicity, we shall use the term &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot; to refer
both to an entire utterance and to a constituent of an ut-
terance, distinguishing between the two only when needed.

which represent the dependence of a phrase&apos;s inter-
pretation on assumptions about subsequent prag-
matic processing. Conditional interpretations are
built compositionally according to declaratively
specified interpretation rules.
The interpretation mechanism we discuss here
has been implemented in Prolog as part of the
Candide system, a multimodal tool for knowledge
acquisition. Incorporating both a graphical inter-
face and a processor for English discourse, Can-
dide allows a user of the Procedural Reasoning
System (PRS) [10] to build and maintain proce-
dural networks in a natural way. Procedural net-
works, an essential part of PRS&apos;s knowledge base,
encode the information about procedures that is
used by PRS for reasoning about and performing
tasks in any given domain. The current version of
Candide has been used to construct networks for
malfunction procedures for NASA&apos;s space shuttle.
Further details of the Candide system will be pre-
sented elsewhere [24].

2 Conditional
Interpretations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993165142857143">
In our approach to semantic and pragmatic in-
terpretation, conditional interpretations separate
the context-independent aspects of an interpreta-
tion from those that are context-dependent. Each
conditional interpretation consists of a sense and
a [possibly empty] set of assumptions. As a first
approximation, one might think of the sense of a
phrase as representing purely semantic informa-
tion, that is, information that can be adduced
solely from the linguistic content of the phrase, no
matter in which context the phrase has been ut-
tered. The assumptions then represent constraints
relating the phrase&apos;s sense to its ultimate interpre-
tation. A complete interpretation has an empty
assumption set, indicating that all of its depen-
dencies on context have been resolved.
The present version of the theory allows for two
kinds of assumptions. A bind assumption intro-
duces a new parameter in an interpretation and
places constraints on the binding of the parameter
to individuals in the context. A restrict assump-
tion does not introduce a new parameter, but in-
stead further restricts the way in which an existing
parameter can be bound.
These concepts are illustrated by the following
conditional interpretation of the sentence &amp;quot;The jet
failed&amp;quot;:
rThe jet failedl =

(fail(x), (bind(x,def, jet))) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968666666667">
The first element of the interpretation is the sense
fail(x), while the second is the set of assump-
tions containing a single assumption whose infor-
mal reading is that x should be bound to some-
thing of the sort jet according to the constraints
of definite reference.

3 The Interpretation Pro-
cess
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998694775">
The process of semantic and pragmatic interpre-
tation computes complete interpretations of sen-
tences from least-commitment parse trees. Two
types of rules govern the interpretation pro-
cess: semantic-interpretation rules and pragmatic-
discharge. rules.
Semantic-interpretation rules specify the con-
ditional interpretation of a phrase in terms of
the conditional interpretations of its constituents.
Compositionality is enforced by making semantic-
interpretation rules sensitive only to the syntac-
tic types of a phrase and its constituents, as well
as to the types of assumptions in the conditional
interpretations associated with the constituents;
semantic-interpretation rules are not sensitive to
the senses of the constituents.
Pragmatic-discharge rules change the condi-
tional interpretation of a phrase by specifying how
assumptions in the conditional interpretation may
be eliminated with respect to the context of utter-
ance. For example, one discharge rule applies to
assumptions constraining a parameter to be bound
as a definite reference. This rule allows an assump-
tion of the form bind(v, def, T) to be discharged,
provided that there is a unique contextually avail-
able entity of sort T. The effect of applying the
definite discharge rule to an interpretation (S, A)
is twofold: the bind assumption operated upon is
removed from the set of assumptions A; the sense
S is changed to reflect the binding. For instance,
if the rule were applied to the interpretation in
(1), and if the context of utterance C contained a
unique available entity j of sort jet, the resulting
interpretation would be
(Jail(j), (2)
As we shall see in the next section, assumption dis-
charge will in general not only make use of but also
change the discourse context. Therefore, discharge
rules should be viewed as four-place relations. For
example, the following would be an instance of the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999957891304348">
where C is the discourse context before the as-
sumption is discharged, while C&apos; is the resulting
discourse context.
Semantic-interpretation rules are obligatory in
that some semantic-interpretation rule associated
with a given syntactic rule must be applied to any
phrase analyzed by the syntactic rule. In contrast,
the application of pragmatic-discharge rules is op-
tional, although discharging a particular assump-
tion too early or too late may lead to a dead end
in the interpretation process. Applying the same
discharge rule at different points in the interpreta-
tion process for some utterance may lead to alter-
native interpretations, as we shall illustrate with
the examples in Sections 6 and 7.
Given a sentence and its syntactic analy-
sis, the interpretation process applies semantic-
interpretation and pragmatic-discharge rules, ac-
cording to their applicability conditions, to con-
struct the derivation of a complete interpretation
of the sentence. In Candide, this process resem-
bles a syntax-directed translation system [1]. In-
terpretation starts at the root node of the anal-
ysis tree. For each node of the tree, the inter-
pretation process selects an appropriate semantic-
interpretation rule and calls itself recursively for
each of the node&apos;s daughters. Interpretations are
constructed on return from the recursion, and
pragmatic-discharge rules are optionally applied
in a discharge cycle that follows each application
to a node of a semantic-interpretation rule.
Lexical ambiguity, multiple semantic-interpre-
tation rules for a given syntactic construction, op-
tional application of discharge rules, and alter-
native ways of discharging a given assumption.
are all sources of nondeterminism in the interpre-
tation process, which need to be somehow con-
trolled. In Candide, we adopted four simple con-
trol tactics: overall depth-first search, early dis-
charge of assumptions, breadth-first search for al-
ternative bindings of a discharged parameter, and
bounds on assumption percolation wherever it can
be shown that an assumption would not be dis-
chargeable outside a certain syntactic domain. For
lack of space, a fuller discussion of these heuristics
will be conducted elsewhere [24].

4 The Discourse Context
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982516211538462">
Pragmatic-discharge rules need access to a dis-
course context that encodes information about rel-
evant world knowledge and the discourse history.
Although our framework for semantic and prag-
matic interpretation can accommodate alternative
representations of the discourse context, the spe-
cific discharge rules we have written and incorpo-
rated into the Candide system rely on a particular
representation comprising four parts: immediate
context, local context, global context, and a knowl-
edge base.
During the analysis of a sentence, the immediate
context contains detailed information about the
entities referred to in that sentence; it is used pri-
marily for resolving intrasentential anaphora. The
local context generally contains detailed informa-
tion about the immediately preceding sentence,4
while the global context includes somewhat less
detailed information about entities referred to
throughout longer stretches of the discourse. We
use the local context primarily for pronoun resolu-
tion, following the theory of centering introduced
by Grosz et a/412]. The global context is employed
primarily for the resolution of definite anaphora,
and is structured as a stack to make use of the
theory of focusing. Each element of the global-
context stack is itself a list of entries containing
information about the entities referred to in a dis-
course segment [13]. We refer to the top element
of the global context as the intermediate context.
Individual discharge rules used in processing a
sentence can extend the immediate context for
that sentence. For instance, the rule mentioned
earlier that binds a parameter as a definite refer-
ence adds to the immediate context an entry for
the entity to which the parameter is bound. When
the assumption in (1) is discharged, resulting in
the interpretation in (2), an entry for j must be
added to the immediate context. The entry will
include the sort of j (jet) and the surface position
of that phrase in the sentence (subject).
The discourse context must also be updated af-
ter each sentence has been processed. In the sim-
plest case, the update will be quite straightfor-
ward, as illustrated in Figure 1: the current im-
mediate context will become the new local con-
text, while a subset of the information encoded in
the immediate context will be also added to the
intermediate context (the topmost element of the
global-context stack). The immediate context will

has just occurred [13].

For the moment, we shall assume that the knowl-
edge base is static, although it will ultimately have
to be reorganizable dynamically so as to reflect a
language user&apos;s current perspective.
In fact, the update function can be rather more
complex. For example, if the current utterance is
recognized to be the start of a subordinate dis-
course segment, a new, empty element can be
pushed onto the global-context stack after the lo-
cal context has been merged into the previous top
element. We shall discuss the discourse-context
update function further elsewhere [24].

5 A Simple Discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995167393939394">
The following simple discourse will provide our
first illustration of the interpretation mechanism
and, in particular, the treatment of reference and
coreference:
The jet failed. (3)
Close the manifold.
In the subsequent sections, we shall turn to more
complex examples that provide further insight into
the way in which pragmatic processes can interact
with one another affecting syntactic and semantic
decisions.
The three semantic-interpretation rules given in
Figure 2 are needed in the example. Recall that
the interpretation process is driven by semantic-
interpretation rules, which apply compositionally
to phrases. Each such rule has three parts: an ap-
plicability condition (AC), a set of selection func-
tions (SF), and a conditional-intenmtation func-
tion (CIF). The applicability condition specifies
the syntactic type of phrase to which the seman-
tic interpretation rule applies; it is stated in terms
of a predicate on trees.5 The selection func-
tions specify how to access the constituents of the
phrase to which the rule is to be applied. Fi-
nally, the conditional-interpretation function de-
fines the conditional interpretation of the phrase
as a function of the conditional interpretations
of its constituents. A conditional-interpretation
function will often depend separately on the sense
and assumptions of a conditional interpretation I,
for which we use the notations Is and IA, respec-
tively.

ing the derivation of a complete interpretation of
the first sentence in (3). Conditional interpreta-
tions of constituents of the complete sentence are
shown above the root nodes of the corresponding
subtrees.
Semantic-interpretation rule [lex] applies to lex-
ical subtrees (Nodes 2 and 5 in Figure 37) associ-
tures of lexical-functional granunar [4] than to the usual
surface constituent structures. The sample analyses have
been extremely simplified for expository reasons, terminal
nodes, in particular, appear in the trees simply as the corre-
sponding word, but their actual representation, as required
by interpretation rule [lex], has two branches: vvordstem for
the actual root form of the terminal, cat for its syntactic
category. Finally, tree nodes relevant to the discussion are
numbered for ease of reference.
&apos;Node 4 is also lexical, but definite determiners con-
tribute only to the interpretation of their mother noun
ating with each wordstem W conditional interpre-
tations /w according to the lexicon. The lexical
entries relevant to the current discussion are:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981022137931034">
In the conditional interpretation of a common
noun, the sense is always a sort term. The assump-
tion set may be empty, as it is for &amp;quot;jet&amp;quot; above, but
for a relational noun it will contain bind assump-
tions for the relation&apos;s arguments, binding param-
eters occurring in the sort term.
The lexical entries for verbs and the structural
rules that combine a verb with its subject and
complements must refer, through assumptions, to
the grammatical functions that provide the argu-
ments of the predicates that represent the senses of
verbs (roughly the governable grammatical func-
tions of lexical-functional grammar [4,27]). Since
we are not defending any particular theory of
grammar in this paper, we shall skirt a theoretical
and terminological minefield by naming the gram-
matical functions relevant to our purposes argi
for i = 1, , n, and calling them simply &amp;quot;argu-
ments.&amp;quot; Arguments are used as edge labels in our
analyses, as well as in bind and restrict assump-
tions, and their intended interpretation should be
clear from the examples we are discussing.
The encoding of selectional restrictions is illus-
trated here in the conditional interpretation of the
verb &amp;quot;fail,&amp;quot; which is fail(x), under the assumption
that x must be bound as first argument of the
verb to something of the sort device. This inter-
phrase, by rule Iclef-np], rather than being given a sepa-
rate interpretation.

<bodyText confidence="0.976665697674419">
pretation effectively encodes the information that
things that fail are devices.8
Because the local tree rooted at Node 3 repre-
sents a definite noun phrase, rule [def-np] applies
to it in a straightforward fashion, yielding the con-
ditional interpretation
(b, {bind(b, def, jet)}) (4)
That is, &amp;quot;the jet&amp;quot; is interpreted as b under the as-
sumption that b can be bound in accordance with
the constraints of definite reference to an entity of
sort jet.
As mentioned earlier, a pragmatic-discharge
rule may be used whenever it is applicable to some
conditional interpretation in context. In the cur-
rent example, the rule for discharging the bind as-
sumption is applicable to the conditional interpre-
tation in (4), and it is actually used in the deriva-
tion to determine a referent for the definite noun
phrase.
The process of resolving a definite reference is
of course quite complex [5,11,28,29], and the rule
that discharges assumptions to bind a parameter
as a definite reference must reflect this complex-
ity. For the moment, let us assume that there is
only one entity of the correct sort available for def-
inite reference (perhaps introduced in a preceding
portion of the discourse): the jet identified as j.
The pragmatic discharge rule can thus bind the
parameter b to j, extend the immediate context
accordingly, and delete the bind assumption from
the list of assumptions in the current conditional
interpretation. The resulting conditional interpre-
tation of the string &amp;quot;the jet&amp;quot; is (j, 0), shown in
Figure 3 above Node 3&apos;.
Finally, consider the interpretation of the whole
sentence. Rule [iv-clause] applies to the parse tree
for the sentence, specifying that its sense is the
sense of the predicate (pred) constituent, namely
faika), and that its set of assumptions is the
union of (i) the assumptions from its predicate
constituent, (ii) the assumptions from its argu-
ment (arg1) constituent, and (iii) the new assump-
tion restrict(argl, =, j), where j is the sense of the
argument constituent. The restrict assumption,
which arises from the sentence&apos;s syntactic form,
applies to whatever parameter is to be bound as
the first argument of the sense of the sentence—in
8The conditional interpretation shown above Node 2 in
the figure has a new parameter, a, substituted for the vari-
able x of the lexical entry because parameters introduced
through bind assumptions in distinct applications of seman-
tic interpretation-rules in a derivation must be themselves
distinct.
this case, a, as specified by the bind assumption
inherited from the predicate constituent. The re-
strict assumption further constrains the binding
of this parameter by requiring that it be equated
with the entity j.
The interpretation process is completed after
the two remaining assumptions are discharged, as
indicated at the top of Figure 3.8 They can be
discharged successfully in parallel: binding a to j
is legitimate because j is a jet, and jet is a subsort
of device. Before the next sentence is processed
the discourse context needs to be updated, as de-
scribed earlier.
The second sentence of our example is &amp;quot;Close
the manifold&amp;quot;; we shall be concerned primarily
with the way in which the reference resolution
problem is handled. The conditional interpreta-
tion for the definite noun phrase &amp;quot;the manifold&amp;quot;
is
(c, {bind(c, def, manifold)}) (5)
Discharging the bind assumption here requires the
use not only of world knowledge — namely, that
each jet is attached to one and only one manifold
— but also of knowledge of the discourse history—
namely that there is a single salient jet in context,
the one identifed as j. The latter information can
be derived from the discourse context, while the
former must be encoded in the knowledge base.
This information is sufficient to resolve the ref-
erence in the sentence under consideration: &amp;quot;the
manifold&amp;quot; refers to the manifold that is attached
to j. Hence the interpretation we derive from (5)
is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.962623">
(m,4) (6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931166666667">
where m is the unique manifold attached to jet j.
For use in constraining subsequent reference, the
discourse context must be updated with the infor-
mation that In has the restricted sort : manifold
As. attached-to(x , j), where sip is the subsort of s
whose elements satisfy property P.

erwise an erroneous interpretation might be derived if the

node. A better scheme would encode sufficient information

We shall now turn to the kind of interactions in
pragmatic processing that challenge compositional
systems. In this section we shall discuss an exam-
ple of quantifier scope ambiguity; following that,
we shall give an example of our analysis of donkey
sentences, involving interactions between quanti-
fier scoping and reference resolution.
The following sentence illustrates the quantifier
scoping problem in its simplest form:
Every driver controls a jet. (7)
This sentence might be given either a wide-scope
existential (3V) interpretation, in which all the
drivers control the same jet, or a narrow-scope ex-
istential (V3) interpretation, in which each driver
controls its own, possibly different, jet.

Derivations of the 3V and the V3 interpretations
are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.
In both derivations, the general noun phrase
&amp;quot;every driver&amp;quot; is interpreted at Node 2 by rule
[gen-quant] and the indefinite noun phrase &amp;quot;a jet&amp;quot;
is interpreted at Node 1 by rule [indef-np]. How-
ever, the two derivations differ as to where the
indefinite-reference assumption is discharged. In
Figure 5 the assumption is discharged immediately
after its introduction. The resulting sense is a new
entity j of sort jet. The same 3V reading could
also be derived by allowing the indefinite-reference
assumption to percolate up to Node 3, but then
discharging it before the generalized quantifier as-
sumption. In either case, the immediate context
is updated at the time of the discharge with an
entry for the new entity j.
Somewhat more interesting is the derivation of
the V3 reading, shown in Figure 6. The indefinite-
reference assumption is allowed to percolate to
Node 3, where the generalized-quantifier assump-
tion is discharged. This discharge applies a quan-
tifier to its scope, but it also selects some sub-
set of the outstanding indefinite-reference assump-
tions in the current conditional interpretation and
discharges them, by existential quantification of
the respective parameters, within the scope of the
generalized quantifier. In our example, the rule
converts the conditional interpretation

We can now discuss the more complicated inter-
actions between assumptions occurring in donkey
sentences. Our example will be the sentence:
Every driver controlling a jet closes it. (8)
Clearly, this sentence has an interpretation in
which, for every driver controlling a jet, the driver
closes the jet. However, it is difficult to see how
this interpretation can be derived compositionally.
The well-recognized problem is that, in the in-
tended reading, the indefinite noun phrase &amp;quot;a jet&amp;quot;
has narrower scope than the determiner &amp;quot;every,&amp;quot;
forcing its interpretation to be part of the sort
term translating the nominal &amp;quot;driver controlling
a jet.&amp;quot; But this means that the interpretation of
the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; will be outside the scope of the
indefinite &amp;quot;a jet.&amp;quot;
Our solution to the problem of interpreting don-
key sentences involves two new mechanisms: cap-

noun phrase to discharge in a particular way bind
assumptions derived from singular noun phrases
occurring in the general noun phrase, and a pro-
noun resolution rule that discharges a pronoun-
introduced bind assumption by replacing the as-
sumption&apos;s parameter with the parameter bound
by the assumption for a possible antecedent of the
pronoun.
Figure 7 shows a simplified derivation of an
interpretation of sentence (8), with some of the
less interesting assumptions discharged immedi-
ately after their introduction rather than being
listed explicitly. Before discussing the main points
of this example we need to explain our somewhat
nonstandard representation of [reduced] relative
clauses, as in the compound nominal &amp;quot;driver con-
trolling a jet&amp;quot; (Node 2). A relative clause is rep-
resented as a main clause but has one of its argu-
ment positions filled by a nominal (the head noun
modified by the relative clause) instead of a noun
phrase. The discharge rule discussed in Section 5
that combines a verb argument with its filler then
has two versions: one in which the filler sense is
an entity, already described, and one in which the
filler sense is a sort. In the latter case, the rule
produces an interpretation whose sense is the filler
sort restricted by the sense of the clause. In the
foregoing example, the sort-filler discharge rule is
applied to the interpretation

to produce the restricted sort

After these preliminaries, we can go on to the
main point of the example. The first observation
to make is that the sentence has an alternative
(albeit unlikely) interpretation in which &amp;quot;a jet&amp;quot; is
taken to refer to a specific jet that every driver
controls. This interpretation would be derived by
discharging the corresponding indefinite-reference
assumption at Nodes 1 or 2 in the derivation.10
We shall assume that this is not done, and that the
indefinite-reference assumption is therefore avail-
able at Node 3.
So far bind assumptions have been given as
triples of a parameter, a binding criterion (derived
from a determiner), and a sort restriction for the
parameter. In fact, a fourth component of depen-
1°A third interpretation is also possible, in which &amp;quot;a jet&amp;quot;
is interpreted as a narrow-scope (nonreferential) existential,
and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is interpreted as having an extrasentential refer-
ent. Limitations in Candide&apos;s handling of nonreferential
indefinites preclude this reading, but a somewhat different
rule system will generate all three readings correctly [24
den cies is in general required, a set of other as-
sumptions that the given assumption may depend
on.11 An assumption a (the dependent assump-
tion) depends on another assumption # (the inde-
pendent assumption) whenever the parameter for
# occurs in the sort constraint of a. For the lan-
guage fragment under discussion, a would be the
bind assumption for a complex noun phrase and
# the bind assumption for a noun phrase within a
prepositional phrase or relative clause in the com-
plex noun phrase. For correct binding of quanti-
fied parameters, semantic interpretation and dis-
charge rules must maintain the invariant that as-
sumptions on which a given assumption depends
can occur only in its set of dependencies. Con-
sequently, whenever a dependent assumption a
is introduced any other assumption on which it
depends must be moved into a&apos;s dependencies,
thereby becoming inaccessible to discharge rules.
If a is later discharged, the assumptions in its set
of dependencies again become accessible to dis-

charge rules. Semantic interpretation must be
modified to fit this analysis. For instance, rule
[gen-quant], given earlier, should be instead
[gen-quant&apos;]:
AC: gen-quant(T)
SF: pred(T) = Q, arg1(T) = N
CIF: VI = (x, {bind(x, I[Q]s, &apos;VIA)))
In Figure 7, this rule is applied at Node 3.
Capture may occur whenever a generalized-
quantifier assumption with a nonempty set of de-
pendencies D is discharged. Any indefinite as-
sumption in D may be captured by turning it into
a universal-quantification assumption and putting
it into the set of assumptions for the new con-
ditional interpretation. In our example, the in-
definite assumption for &amp;quot;a jet&amp;quot; is captured in the
discharge of the universal assumption for &amp;quot;every
driver...&amp;quot;, from Node 4 to Node 4&apos; in the deriva-
tion. The resulting assumption is now universal.
If this assumption were discharged immediately,
there would be no way of discharging the pronoun
assumption as an intrasentential anaphoric refer-
ence. Instead the pronoun resolution rule is ap-
plied to discharge the pronoun assumption, caus-
ing identification of the pronoun parameter c with
the jet parameter b. The resulting conditional in-
terpretation is 4&amp;quot;. Finally, the remaining assump-
tion can be discharged by quantification leading
to the complete interpretation at Node 41&amp;quot;.
The example shows how assumptions allow in-
teractions between reference and quantification to
be left unresolved until all the necessary informa-
tion becomes available. Early discharge of the
assumption for &amp;quot;a driver&amp;quot; blocks the desired in-
terpretation for the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;; capture makes
available the attributive use of &amp;quot;a driver&apos; at an ap-
propriate point for its identification with the direct
object of &amp;quot;close.&amp;quot;

Strictly compositional approaches to semantic in-
terpretation, such as Montague grammar [19],
have so far proved inadequate for dealing with
interactions between meaning and context; rea-
sons for this are noted in Section 1. Our ap-
proach can be thought of as a generalization of
the compositional mechanism of Cooper storage
[6], or of its computational analogue developed by
Woods [30]. Alternative approaches that attempt
to address these interactions include discourse-
representation theory (DRT) [14,18] and Barwise&apos;s
partial-valuation approach [2].
In DRT, the interpretation of a sentence is
derived in a compositional manner from an
intermediate representation called a discourse-
representation structure (DRS). However, the
rules that have been developed for constructing
DRSs are not themselves compositional. Accord-
ing to the DRS-construction rules presented by
Kamp [18], the DRS for a phrase is found only as
a by-product of finding the DRS for the embed-
ding discourse. In particular, DRS-construction
rules apply only after the relative scope of noun
phrases and anaphoric bindings have been deter-
mined. It is conceivable that our notion of con-
ditional interpretation might be reexpressible in
DRT terms, leading to a compositional system for
DRS construction.
Barwise [2] uses the notion of partial valuation,
that is, partial assignments of values to variables,
to analyze the sorts of interactions exemplified by
the donkey sentences. Similar comments apply to
Webber&apos;s work [29]. In addition, none of the afore-
mentioned accounts has been concerned with as
wide a range of phenomena as is currently han-
dled in Candide.12 One of the motivations for
our work has been to see how Barwise&apos;s direct-
interpretation approach could be turned into a
two-stage one in which phrases are first &amp;quot;com-
piled&amp;quot; into conditional interpretations, which are
then &amp;quot;executed&amp;quot; by applying pragmatic-discharge
rules.
Finally, several other computational systems de-
veloped recently are concerned with interactions
between context and meaning, especially Pundit
[8,21] and Tacitus [17,16]. Both these systems
have emphasized solutions to such difficult prag-
matic problems as reference resolution. In particu-
lar, the Pundit project has made notable progress
on the question of resolving missing arguments,
while the Tacitus group has done the same for
questions involving the determination of implicit
relations. In Candide, solutions to such prag-
matic problems should be encoded in the proce-
dures that discharge assumptions; in future ver-
sions of the system the discharge procedures might
be improved applying some of the techniques de-
veloped in this other work. What neither Pundit
nor Tacitus has been concerned with is the ques-
tion of how to build interpretations composition-
I2To date, we have included capabilites for process-
ing reference and coreference (definite and indefinite noun
phrases, pronouns, possessives, and proper nouns), quan-
tifier scope, compound nominals, prepositional-phrase at-
tachment, and certain types of underspecified relations
(e.g., main-verb &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;). We shall report on these mecha-
nisms elsewhere [241.

ally. Both systems first build partial interpreta-
tions of sentences, and then attempt to solve a
collection of associated pragmatic problems. Pun-
dit does the latter in an overly constrained way,
with the result that it cannot handle systemati-
cally the sort of interactions exemplified by the
donkey sentences. Tacitus, on the other hand,
casts all the pragmatic problems as theorems to be
proved; the result is an underconstrained control
strategy. We believe that the generally composi-
tional approach developed in Candide enables us
to avoid both these extremes.

We have developed a mechanism of semantic and
pragmatic interpretation that relaxes the con-
straints of compositional semantics just - enough
to allow pragmatic information to play its neces-
sary role in the derivation of sentence interpreta-
tions. Central to the mechanism are conditional
interpetations, which allow us to separate con-
straints on interpretation that depend only on syn-
tactic structure, represented by the sense compo-
nent of the conditional interpretation, from those
that depend on pragmatic choices, represented
by the assumption component. The interpreta-
tion process is carried out by a combination of
semantic-interpretation rules, which build condi-
tional interpretations of phrases on the basis of
lexical and syntactic information, and pragmatic-
discharge rules, which satisfy assumptions on the
basis of discourse and domain information. While
the system we have implemented deals with a va-
riety of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, of
which only a few were discussed in this paper, it
can only be seen as a first limited instantiation
of a system architecure that requires much further
work. We shall mention now a few of the directions
that might be pursued in developing the architec-
ture further.
At the most theoretical level, it is interesting
to note the formal similarity of our interpretation
rules to rules in &amp;quot;deductive&amp;quot; models of program-
ming language semantics [25]. It is also interest-
ing to consider the connection between conditional
interpretations and the relational theory of mean-
ing from situation semantics [3]. These two simi-
larities might be fruitful in developing a semantic
justification for our formal interpretation rules in
terms of constraints on interpretation relations.
The applicability of discharge rules depends in
many cases on the compatibility of expected and
supplied sorts for relation arguments. In gen-
eral, these sorts may be parameterized by assump-
tion parameters, and some semantic interpretation
problems not considered here suggest that higher-
order parameterized types, instead of first-order
sorts, may be needed. A suitable notion of type
subsumption for such higher-order parameterized
types [15] would be useful. More generally, the
whole architecture would benefit from a semanti-
cally grounded treatment of parameters and pa-
rameterized objects.
Other pragmatic processes associated with dis-
charge rules, such as those for reference resolution,
also must be able to reason with parameterized
objects—for example in checking the uniqueness of
a dependent object relative to arbitrary parame-
ter assignments. Ultimately, the proper treatment
of singular noun phrases in context will require a
closer connection between assumptions and [pa-
rameterized] fragments of the discourse context.

The mechanism can handle a wide range of pragmatic phenomena and their interactions. 1 Introduction Compositional systems of semantic interpretation, while logically and computationally very attractive [6,20,26], seem unable to cope with the fact that the syntactic form of an utterance is not the only source of information about its meaning.

We shall mention now a few of the directions that might be pursued in developing the architecture further. At the most theoretical level, it is interesting to note the formal similarity of our interpretation rules to rules in &amp;quot;deductive&amp;quot; models of programming language semantics [25]. It is also interesting to consider the connection between conditional interpretations and the relational theory of meaning from situation semantics [3]. These two similarities might be fruitful in developing a semantic justification for our formal interpretation rules in terms of constraints on interpretation relations. The applicability of discharge rules depends in many cases on the compatibility of expected and supplied sorts for relation arguments. In general, these sorts may be parameterized by assumption parameters, and some semantic interpretation problems not considered here suggest that higherorder parameterized types, instead of first-order sorts, may be needed. A suitable notion of type subsumption for such higher-order parameteri</context>

This model of semantic interpretation assumes that contextual information is available whenever it is needed for deciding among alternative interpretations. However, this is often not the case: questions about the interpretation of some constituent of an utterance might be answerable only when information about the interpretation of syntactically distant constituents becomes available. Familiar examples of this can be found, for instance, in sentences with quantifier scoping ambiguities and in sentences that include intrasentential anaphora. The so-called donkey sentences [9] exhibit both these phenomena. These difficulties do not necessitate a complete abandonment of compositionality. To take advantage of the generally compositional nature of semantic analysis without constraining unduly the order in which pragmatic decisions are made, we assign to phrases conditional interpretations, 2There are reasons to suspect that ultimately syntactic analysis should be incorporated into the same stage of processing as semantic and pragmatic analysis; in particular, it is difficult to develop syntactically neutral representations for certain constructions such as conjunction</context>

Contextual information—information about the world and about the history of a discourse— influences not only an utterance&apos;s meaning, but even its preferred syntactic analysis [3,5,7,16].

Finally, several other computational systems developed recently are concerned with interactions between context and meaning, especially Pundit [8,21] and Tacitus [17,16]. Both these systems have emphasized solutions to such difficult pragmatic problems as reference resolution. In particular, the Pundit project has made notable progress on the question of resolving missing arguments, while the Tacitus group has done the same for questions involving the determination of implicit relations. In Candide, solutions to such pragmatic problems should be encoded in the procedures that discharge assumptions; in future versions of the system the discharge procedures might be improved applying some of the techniques developed in this other work.

Incorporating both a graphical interface and a processor for English discourse, Candide allows a user of the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) [10] to build and maintain procedural networks in a natural way. Procedural networks, an essential part of PRS&apos;s knowledge base, encode the information about procedures that is used by PRS for reasoning about and performing tasks in any given domain. The current version of Candide has been used to construct networks for malfunction procedures for NASA&apos;s space shuttle. Further details of the Candide system will be presented elsewhere [24]. 2 Conditional Interpretations In our approach to semantic and pragmatic interpretation, conditional interpretations separate the context-independent aspects of an interpretation from those that are context-dependent. Each conditional interpretation consists of a sense and a [possibly empty] set of assumptions. As a first approximation, one might think of the sense of a phrase as representing purely semantic information, that is, information that can be adduced solely from the linguistic content of the phrase, no matter in which context the phrase has been uttered. The assumptions then repres</context>

In Candide, we adopted four simple control tactics: overall depth-first search, early discharge of assumptions, breadth-first search for alternative bindings of a discharged parameter, and bounds on assumption percolation wherever it can be shown that an assumption would not be dischargeable outside a certain syntactic domain. For lack of space, a fuller discussion of these heuristics will be conducted elsewhere [24]. 4 The Discourse Context Pragmatic-discharge rules need access to a discourse context that encodes information about relevant world knowledge and the discourse history. Although our framework for semantic and pragmatic interpretation can accommodate alternative representations of the discourse context, the specific discharge rules we have written and incorporated into the Candide system rely on a particular representation comprising four parts: immediate context, local context, global context, and a knowledge base. During the analysis of a sentence, the immediate context contains detailed inf</context>

For the moment, we shall assume that the knowledge base is static, although it will ultimately have to be reorganizable dynamically so as to reflect a language user&apos;s current perspective. In fact, the update function can be rather more complex. For example, if the current utterance is recognized to be the start of a subordinate discourse segment, a new, empty element can be pushed onto the global-context stack after the local context has been merged into the previous top element. We shall discuss the discourse-context update function further elsewhere [24]. 5 A Simple Discourse The following simple discourse will provide our first illustration of the interpretation mechanism and, in particular, the treatment of reference and coreference: The jet failed. (3) Close the manifold. In the subsequent sections, we shall turn to more complex examples that provide further insight into the way in which pragmatic processes can interact with one another affecting syntactic and semantic decisions. The three semantic-interpretation rules given in Figure 2 are needed in the example. Recall that the interpretation process is driven by semanticinterpretation ru</context>

While the system we have implemented deals with a variety of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, of which only a few were discussed in this paper, it can only be seen as a first limited instantiation of a system architecure that requires much further work. We shall mention now a few of the directions that might be pursued in developing the architecture further. At the most theoretical level, it is interesting to note the formal similarity of our interpretation rules to rules in &amp;quot;deductive&amp;quot; models of programming language semantics [25]. It is also interesting to consider the connection between conditional interpretations and the relational theory of meaning from situation semantics [3]. These two similarities might be fruitful in developing a semantic justification for our formal interpretation rules in terms of constraints on interpretation relations. The applicability of discharge rules depends in many cases on the compatibility of expected and supplied sorts for relation arguments. In general, these sorts may be parameterized by assumption parameters, and some semantic interpretation problems not considered here suggest </context>
