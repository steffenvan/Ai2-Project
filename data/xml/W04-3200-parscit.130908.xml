EMNLP 2004 represents the twelfth year of SIGDAT meetings, and reflects an unprecedented
new scale that will doubtless impact heavily the future course to be charted by the community. We
received a record 257 submissions, compared with approximately 140 in the two preceding years.
In order to avoid dropping the 24% acceptance rate of preceding years, a record 58 papers were
accepted (of which 2 were subsequently withdrawn) while 17 were committed to other conferences.
This volume is over 450 pages—yet another record.
Even with fairly long days, two scheduling innovations have been necessary to accommodate
the enlarged scale: twin parallel sessions run throughout the entire two-day event, and a poster
format has been added (allowing more slots than “reserve papers”).
The community deserves great credit for pitching in to meet this year’s challenge of scaling
up EMNLP within its traditional extremely tight submission-to-publication timeframe. To put
this in perspective, the first pioneering meeting held in 1993 as the Workshop on Very Large
Corpora (WVLC) featured 13 papers and a handful of reviewers. EMNLP was introduced in 1996
initially as a second annual event, then merged as EMNLP/VLC in 1999 and 2000 when empirical
methodology penetrated the mainstream, after which the WVLC moniker was retired. In 2002 there
were 53 reviewers. For EMNLP 2004 this year, there were 150+, nearly half of whom committed
on extremely short notice. Moreover, members on average undertook about 50% more reviews than
they signed up for. We were fortunate still to receive at least three reviews on the vast majority of
papers (though technical obstacles prevented some from being entered into the conference workflow
database).
The unprecedented level of submissions has also led us to introduce an Area Chair system—
perhaps yet another step toward maturity for SIGDAT. Much credit goes to the Area Chairs for their
dedication and citizenship in taking on a great deal of additional work with conscientious attention
to detail, again with fairly little warning, in a year when the community had already borne unusually
heavy reviewing duties from the large number of conferences.
We are happy to observe that the resulting program reflects a healthy continuing diversification
of empirical NLP work. Increased representation is found in areas including semantic role labeling,
discourse, dialog, summarization, question answering, sentiment, boundary detection, and sentence
processing, in addition to traditional strengths in machine translation, parsing and tagging, word
sense disambiguation, morphology, IR, and speech. We have striven to respect the reviewers as
much as possible, with careful readings of their commentary together with the papers and not just
the numeric ratings; we sought primarily to compensate as much as possible for reviewing variances
and idiosyncrasies. But once again there were simply too many good papers submitted, and we can
only hope you do enjoy the selection that the constrained program permitted!
This year we are introducing, as an experiment, a best paper award selection mechanism based
on a larger (and hopefully, more statistically significant) sample size, so as to offset the larger
number of papers. Rather than relying on the judgment of a small number of chairs, we are inviting
all of you, the registrants, to vote for the paper you believe will be seen ten years from now as
having had the most impact. A decade may be a long time to wait for confirmation, but aren’t all
good things worth waiting for...?
Still another program innovation this year is the joint keynote address with Senseval-3. As
kindred spirits in empirical methodology, we trust that the coordination between our overlapping
meetings will strengthen the experience for participants of both, and we are grateful to Rada
Mihalcea and Phil Edmonds for their cooperative efforts. We are especially grateful to our speaker,
Ken Church, for accepting this challenge.
Our thanks also go to David Yarowsky for assembling the proceedings, and to Toni Badia and
the local organizers for making possible the unexpected expansion of the conference.
The EMNLP special theme this year is Empiricism and Error Analysis, and we are happy to see
a number of papers that made serious attempts to move forward on this front. We encouraged papers
that apply existing or new methodology for meaningful empirical analysis of errors, independent
of the application. The theme emphasizes that learning algorithms are not merely magic “black
boxes”. Corpus-based NLP has reached a stage of maturity where many competing models have
reached comparable plateaus in performance. Merely reporting the aggregate accuracy or coverage
percentages typically fails to uncover the model limitations that are fundamentally responsible for
the plateaus. While reporting aggregate percentages remains essential, instructive research should
also explain a model’s limitations in more meaningful ways. This can be as simple as categorizing
error statistics by finer-grained types of errors, to reveal specific areas of model limitations. Better
yet, we seek deeper insight into the models’ inherent representational biases, in the form of
qualitative theoretical analyses that can be backed up by comparative quantitative measurements.
We especially welcomed empirically verifiable implications arising for feature engineering or model
selection, whether manual or automatic.
Welcome to EMNLP 2004—we hope you will find it thought-provoking and stimulating!
