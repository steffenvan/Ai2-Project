It is not a rare phenomenon for human written text
to use non-restrictive NP modifiers to express es-
sential pieces of information or support the situa-
tion presented in the main proposition containing
the NP, for example, &amp;quot;Private Eye, which couldn&apos;t
afford the libel payment, had been threatened with
closure.&amp;quot; (from Wall Street Journal) Yet no previ-
ous research in NLG investigates this in detail. This
paper describes corpus analysis and a psychanguis-
tic experiment regarding the acceptability of using
non-restrictive NP modifiers to express semantic re-
lations that might normally be signalled by &apos;because&apos;
and &apos;then&apos;. The experiment tests several relevant
factors and enables us to accept or reject a number
of hypotheses. The results are incorporated into an
NLG system based on a Genetic Algorithm.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.97597">
To produce natural language text, an NLG system
must be able to choose among possible paraphrases
one that satisfies the highest number of constraints
in a certain context. Paraphrases can use various
constructions, for example, using nominalisation in-
stead of a clause for event representation. We are
particularly interested in the use of non-restrictive
(NR) modifiers within a referring expression to ex-
press certain semantic relations&apos; other than object-
attribute elaboration (in the sense defined in (Mann
and Thompson; 1987)), for instance, causal rela-
tions, which are normally expressed by separate
clauses connected by cue phrases (Knott, 1996) such
as &apos;because&apos;.
&amp;quot;A non-restrictive component gives additional in-
formation to a head that has already been viewed
as unique or as a member of a class that has been
independently identified,- and therefore is not-essen-,
tial for the identification of the head&amp;quot; (Quirk et al.,
1985). This definition can be extended to account
for modifiers of not only definite referring expres-
sions, but also definite and indefinite NPs of var-

ious types. In this paper, an NR modifier refers
to any NP modifying component that is not essen-
tial for identifying the object denoted by the head,
including all modifiers of an NP that does not in-
tend to identify (e.g. indefinite referring expressions
and predicative phrases) (Kronfeld, 1990). Our dis-
cussion focuses on definite referring expressions in-
cluding proper-names because of the dominance of
such examples in our corpus. However, we would
expect no difficulty in applying our observation to
other types of NPs.
The semantic roles of NR modifiers, in particular
NR clauses, are mentioned in many grammar and
linguistics books. Quirk et al. (1985) point out that
an NR clause in a referring expression is usually neu-
tral in its semantic role (i.e. it provides descriptive
information about its head), but sometimes it can
contribute to the semantics of the main clause in
a variety of ways. They summarise three types of
semantic relations that can be expressed by an NR
clause (examples are given in Figure 1):
O Causal, where the situation in the main clause
is caused by that in the NR clause, e.g. (la).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.673238">
• Temporal, where the two clauses form a time
sequence, e.g. (lb).
o Circumstantial, where the NR clause sets a tem-
poral or spatial framework for interpreting the
main clause, e.g. (1c).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.893489857142857">
Halliday (1985) mentions that a subordinate
clause can elaborate a part of its primary clause
through restating, clarifying, refining or adding a de-
scriptive attribute or comment (see (2) of Figure 1)
Halliday&apos;s notion of elaboration is much more gen-
eral than that in other coherence theories like RST
(Mann -and • Thompson; 1987),. and -the relation- ex-
pressed in (2) would not be treated as elaboration
in most NLG systems.
Similar phenomena were observed from the MUSE
corpus-, a corpus of museum exhibit labels, which

project (Poesio, 2000), which aims at developing general al-
gorithms for generating nominal expressions.

describe museum objects on display. For example,
in (3) of Figure I, the modifier French is not for
identifying the name, but for establishing a conces-
sion relation between the main proposition and the
subordinate phrase to increase the reader&apos;s positive
regard for where Martin Carlin was born.
For the convenience of discussion, we define some
terminology to be used throughout the paper:
An AR construction/sentence : a sentence that has
a main clause and a subordinate NR modifier
attached to one of its NPs (e.g. (4b) of Fig-
ure 2).
A hypotactic construction/sentence : a sentence
that has a main clause and a dependent clause,
connected by a cue phrase. This is a common
way of expressing semantic relations such as
causality (e.g. (4a) of Figure 2). In this syn-
tactic category, we single out a subclass of sen-
tences according to one possible semantic con-
nection between the two clauses. It is defined
below.
An elaboration realisation a type of hypotactic
construction where one clause elaborates the se-
mantics of the other. We take cue phrases as
for&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;what is more&amp;quot; to signal elaboration re-
lations&apos;.
Previous research in NLG mainly focuses on us-
ing NR constructions to realise elaboration relations
but not other semantic relations (e.g. (Scott and
de Souza, 1990) and (Hovy, 1993)). The NR modi-
fier usually adds a descriptive attribute to the object
denoted by the head.
The linguistic research suggests for an NLG sys-
tem the possibility to express certain semantic rela-
tions through NR constructions, which .is important
in two aspects. Firstly, an NR construction gives
a more concise alternative realisation for a relation,
where the relation is expressed implicitly rather than
explicitly and usually more subtly. It does not need

irt their semantic interpretations, but nut using cue phrases
would he even more ambiguous. Resides, our experiment does
not heavily depend on these rue phrases.
cue phrases in most cases, and therefore could avoid
using cues too heavily. This could be a better re-
alisation under certain circumstances. Secondly, an
NR construction enables a wider range of relations
(especially those that are preferred to be expressed
implicitly) to be selected for text structuring because
the corresponding syntactic option is available.
To understand how to enable an NLG system to
generate such modifiers, we are faced with two ques-
tions, which are not answered by linguistic research:
I. Can this type of modifier be identified by human
subjects, i.e. can humans tell the difference be-
tween different NP modifier uses?
2. Under what circumstances can an NR construc-
tion be used in substitution of a hypotactic con-
struction without changing the meaning dra-
matically and how close are the meanings con-
veyed by the two representations?
An NLG system roust come up with some solu-
tions, simple or complex, to these two questions in
order to choose among paraphrases. In this paper,
we use cue phrases as a signal of semantic relations
rather than try to identify the relations directly.
We describe systematically controlled experiments
aimed at finding out the factors related to the gen-
eration of this type of modifier in referring expres-
sions. The result is intended to be reliable enough
to be used by NLG systems in generating descriptive
text.

To _answer the first question,- we annotated the
MUSE corpus, from which we have observed three
types of modifier uses in an NP:
Firstly,. providing _prop erties._ to. uniquely identify
the objects or concepts denoted by theNP.- With-
out these modifiers, the NP can denote more than
one object/concept or sets of objects/concepts and
is ambiguous in its interpretation, e.g. those in (Ga).
Such modifiers usually appear in phrases headed by
the definite article &apos;the&apos;, which according to Lochner
(1987) has the same meaning in all its uses, includ-
ing in generic references and prechcatives. Modifiers

This type subsumes the modifiers normally con-
sidered by the referring expression generation mod-
ule of an NLC system for uniquely identifying the
referents (e.g. (Dale, 1992)).
Secondly, having no effect in constraining a unique
or unambiguous concept out of the NP which is ei-
ther already unique or not required to have a unique
interpretation, but being important to the situation
presented in the main proposition containing the NP.
This type includes the modifiers described in the
previous section and many modifiers in indefinite
predicatives, e.g. that in (6b).
Thirdly, providing additional details about the
referents of the NP, which functions the same way
as the NP without these modifiers, e.g. those in
(6c). The effect of such modifiers is usually local
to the heads they describe rather than to the main
propositions as a whole, which is the main difference
between this and the second type of modifier.
This type subsumes the modifiers normally gen-
erated by an aggregation module, in particular one
using embedding (e.g. (Shaw and McKeown, 1997),
(Cheng, 1998)).

To find out whether the above distinctions make
sense to human subjects, we designed an annotation
scheme for modifiers in NPs, describing which ele-
ments of an NP should be marked as a modifier and
how to mark the features for a modifier. Apart from
other features, each modifier should be -annotated
with a pragmatic function feature (FRAGM), which
specifies why a modifier is used in an NP. The pos-
sible values for this feature are unique, int and attr,
corresponding to the three types of modifier uses de-
scribed above (we will use the value names to refer
to the different types of modifier in the rest of this
paper). X \ IL was used as the markup language.
We had two .trained annotators mark the NP
modifiers in the MUSE corpus according to their
understanding of the scheme. The agreement be-
tween them on the PRAGM feature by means of the
Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) is .734, which means
that the distinctions we are trying to make can be
identified by human subjects to some extent. The
main ambiguity exists between int and attr modi-
fiers. There seems to be a gradual difference between
them and where to draw the line is a bit arbitrary.
In the MUSE corpus annotated so far, 19% of 1078
modifiers in all types of NPs are identified as int. So
this is not a trivial phenomenon.

<bodyText confidence="0.999990166666667">
We reduced the size of the problem of when to use
an NR construction by focusing on two relations: a
causal relation signalled by &apos;because&apos; and a temporal
relation signalled by &apos;then&apos;. The reason for choosing
these relations is that the possibilities of expressing
them through NR constructions have already been
shown by linguists. The two cue phrases are typical
for the corresponding relations arid can often substi-
tute other cue phrases for the same relations. In the
rest of this paper, we will still use the term causal
or temporal relation, but what we actually mean is
the specific relation signalled by &apos;because&apos; or &apos;then&apos;.

From the generation point of view, our question is:
given two facts and the semantic relation between
them, what extra input do we need for making real-

data, and transfered them to NR sentences by hand.

substitute (5a). A similar pattern can be found in a
number of other collected sentences.
We claim that it is the degree of inferrability of the
relation between the semantics expressed through
the two clauses that makes the difference. We define
the inferrability of a causal/temporal relation as:
Given two separate facts, the likeli-
hood of human subjects inferring from their
world knowledge that a causal/temporal
connection between the facts might plausi-
bly exist.
In examples (4) and (5), the fact that Private Eye
cannot afford the libel payment is very likely to di-
rectly cause the closure threaten, whereas a prod-
uct occupying less space is not usually a cause of
it being accepted by retailers according to common
sense. Therefore, the two realisations in (4) can be
used in substitution of one another whereas those in
(5) cannot.
Inferrability is dynamic and user dependent.
Given two facts, people with different background
knowledge can infer the relation between them with
different ease. If a relation is easily recognisable
according to general world knowledge, we say that
the inferrability of the relation is globally strong,
in which case a hypotactic and an NR construction
can express the relation almost equally well (if not
considering rhetorical effect). Context can also con-
tribute to the inferrability of a relation. A relation
not easily recognisable from world knowledge may
be identified by a reader with ease as the discourse
proceeds. In this case, we say that the inferrabil-
ity of the relation is locally strong, where the two
constructions can express the relation equally well
only in a certain context. In this paper, we mainly
consider the global aspect of a relation and we will
describe how we decided the value of inferrability in
the next section,

dent variables) that might play a role in the close-
ness judgement between the semantics of a hypotac-
tic construction and an Nil construction. The levels

tion and Inferrability. Position gives the location of

phrases on human judgement; Subordination speci-
fies whether the nucleus or the satellite is realised

Based on our observation of human written sen-
tences, we have the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis], For both causal and temporal rela-
tions, the inferrability of the relation between the se-
mantics of two facts contributes significantly to the
semantic similarities between a hypotactic construc-
tion and an NR construction.
In other words, if the inferrability of the relation
between the two facts is strong, the semantic rela-
tion can be expressed similarly through an NR con-
struction, otherwise, the similarity is significantly re-
duced.
Hypothesis 2 For the causal relation, the satellite
subordination bears significantly higher similarity in
meaning to the hypotactic construction than the nu-
cleus subordination does.
For example, (4b) would be preferred to &amp;quot;Private
Eye, which had been threatened with closure, couldn&apos;t
afford the libel payment.&amp;quot;
Hypothesis 3 For the temporal relation, both the
position of subordination and the &apos;Use of an appro-
priate cue phrase in the NR clause make a signifi-
cant difference to the semantic similarities between
&apos;a hypotactic and an NR construction.
This hypothesis prefers Example (7) to the reali-
sation that does not have &apos;then&apos;.

3.2 The design of the experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988571920634921">
To assess a semantic similarity, which is thought to
be influenced by the independent variables, we use
human subjects to judge the following two depen-
dent variables:
Naturalness : how fluent a sentence is on its own.
Similarity : how similar the meanings of two sen-
tences are without considering their natural-
ness.
The scales of the variables are selected such that
all values on the scale have natural verbal descrip-
tions that could be grasped easily by our subjects
(see Table 2). Similar rating methods have been
described in (Jordan et al., 1993) to compare the
output of a machine translation system with that of
expert humans.
Since we want to measure different groups of
similarity judgement based on different inferrabil-
ity, order or position levels, a between-groups de-
sign (Hatch and Lazaraton, 1991) seems to be most
appropriate. The design we used is illustrated in
Table 3, where all possible combinations of the in-
dependent variables are listed. In the table, para-
phrases gives the types of alternative sentences each
original sentence has. They should be scored by hu-
man subjects for their similarities to the original sen-
tences and their naturalness.
We used a method similar to random selection
to create a stratified random sample. The sample
should contain 12 hypotactic sentences and 12 NR
sentences, two for each combination of the causal re-
lation arid one for each combination of the temporal
relation. These numbers were used to obtain as big
a sample as possible which could still be judged by
human subjects in a relatively short period of time
(say less than 30 minutes).
Using cue phrases as- the indicators of •the
mantic relations between clauses, we collected all
the sentences containing &apos;been:1.15c or &apos;then&apos; from the
Wall Street Journal source data, and went through
each of them to pick out those that actually signal
the desired relations and can potentially have NR-
realisations, i.e. where there is a coreference relation
between the two NPs in the two clauses. Sentences
containing NR clauses signalled by 4, which&apos; or
-
who &apos;were collected sirnilarly....r.Rom these;sentences,
we randomly selected one by category. If it realised
an unused factor combination, it was kept in the
sample. This process was repeated until we collected
the right number of test items which instantiated all
combinations of properties in Table 3.
We asked two subjects to mark the 24 selected
items with regard to their inferrability on a five-
point scale: 5 for very likely, 4 for quite likely, 3
for possibly, 2 for even, less possibly and 1 for un-
knOtim. We took values of 4 and 5 as strong and &apos;the
others as weak. The subjects and an author agreed
on 19 items, and the author&apos;s version was used for
the experiment.
For the test items, we manually produced the cor-
responding paraphrases, which were then put into a
questionnaire for human assessment of the two de-
pendent variables for each paraphrase.

<bodyText confidence="0.999859272727273">
Since the similarity data is ordinal data and departs
significantly from a theoretical normal distribution
according to One-Sample Komogorov-Smirnov Test,
we chose Mann Whitney U, which is a test for com-
paring two groups on the basis of their ranks above
and below the median. The result is summarised in
Table 4, with statistically significant items in bold-
face (taking the conventional .05 p level). The Z
scores tell how many standard deviations above or
below the mean an observation might be. Means
gives the means of the similarity scores with respect
to the values of the independent variables in Table 1.
For the causal relation, there is a significant dif-
ference between the means of similarities of the two
groups of different inferrabilities (P&lt;.0005). So we
have high confidence to accept part of Hypothesis 1.
i.e. the strong inferrability of the causal relation be-
tween the semantics of two facts makes the semantic
similarities between a hypotactic construction and
an NR construction significantly higher than the
weak case does. In the strong case, the mean of
similarity is 4.59, which is close to very similar.
We treated order as a factor to be balanced and
did not expect it to have a significant effect, but
it does (P=.008). An NR paraphrase shows much
higher similarity to its corresponding hypotactic sen- • -
tence (with a mean of 4.46) than the other way
round (with a mean of 3.83), but the difference be-
comes smaller for the strong inferrability case. This
could be because the causal relations expressed in
NR sentences generally sound weaker than those in
hypotactic sentences and the cue phrase has a big
influence on the perceptibility of a relation.

For the temporal relation, position is the only sig-
nificant factor (P=.0389). So part of Hypothesis 3 is
confirmed, that is, the final position subordination
makes an NR paraphrase significantly more similar
to the corresponding hypotactic construction than
the initial position does.
We do not have enough evidence to accept the
claim that the inferrability of the temporal relation
contributes significantly to the similarity judgement
(as in Hypothesis 1). However, when we calculated
the similarity mean for the alternative sentences us-
ing cue phrases, strong or weak in inferrability, we
got 4.91 (very similar). Comparing this with that of
the strong causal case using the Mann Whitney U
test; we get a significance level of 0.0294. This means
that we have strong confidence to believe that the
similarity mean for the temporal relation if using a
cue phrase is significantly. .higher .than. that for .the
strong causal relation. Therefore, the temporal re-
lation can always be realised by an NR construction
as long as an appropriate cue phrase is used in the
NR clause.
The assumption of normality is also not met by
the subset of the data related to Hypothesis 2 and 3
(i.e. the similarity scores for nucleus/satellite subor--
dination paraphrases and cuedinocue paraphrases).
We used the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks
Test because we were comparing pairs of para-
phrases. The result is given in Table 5. We accept
the hypothesis that the similarity means of nucleus
and satellite subordination are significantly different
in the initial position (Hypothesis 2). This confirms
the linguistic observation that information of greater
importance should be presented in a main position
rather than a subordinate position. We can also ac-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957263523809524">
We briefly summarise the heuristics drawn from the
experiment for expressing the causal and temporal
relations with an NR construction. This is an ac-
ceptable realisation in the following circumstances:
• the causal relation holds between two facts and
the inferrability of the relation is strong, in
which case satellite subordination should be
used; or
o the temporal relation holds between two facts,
in which case a final position subordination and
an appropriate cue phrase, like &apos;then&apos;, should be
used in the NR clause.
We also found that an NR construction can ex-
press the causal/temporal relation and the object-
attribute elaboration relation at the same time, ir-
respective of the inferrability of the relation. Gen-
erally speaking, a semantic relation expressed by an
NR construction sounds weaker than a hypotactic
realisation with a cue phrase. Therefore, if a rela-
tion is to be emphasised. NR constructions should
not be used.

4 Implementing the results in a
GA-based text planner
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915457142857">
int-modifiers have a mixed character, i.e. like attr-
modifiers they are not essential for identifying the
referents, hut like unique-modifiers they are not op-
tional. Because of their role in supporting the se-
mantics of the main propositions, the selection of
int-modifiers should be a part of the text planning
process, where a text structure is constructed to ful-
fill the overall goals for producing the text. How-
ever, compared with unique-modifiers, int-modifiers
are less essential for an NP and they can only be
added if there are available syntactic slots.
Since embedding deals with attr-modifiers at both
a content selection and an abstract realisation level,
it could coordinate the addition of int-modifiers.
Therefore, the text planner could consult the embed-
ding module as to whether a property can be realised
as an NP modifier, under the constraints from the
NP type and the unique-modifiers that are already
there. In other words, the text planner chooses facts
to satisfy certain goals and the embedding process
decides if the facts can be realised as NP modifiers
in an abstract sense.
We need a generation architecture that allows a
certain degree of interaction between text planning,
referring expression generation and embedding. So
we chose the Genetic Algorithm based text planner
described in (Mellish et al., 1998). Their task is,
given a set of facts and- relations b-etween facts, to
produce a legal RST tree using all the facts and some
relations. The text planning is basically a two step
process. Firstly sequences of facts are generated by
applying GA operators, and secondly the rhetorical
structure trees built from these sequences are evalu-
ated and the good sequences are kept for producing
better offspring.

<bodyText confidence="0.999921703703704">
We extended the text planner by adding a GA op-
erator called embedding mutation, which .randomly
selects two items mentioning a common entity from
a sequence and assumes an embedding on them. Em-
beddings are evaluated together with the other prop-
erties an RST tree has. In this way, embedding is
performed during text planning. The ultimate score
of a tree is the sum of positive and negative scores
for all the good and bad properties it bears. Since
good embeddings are scored higher, they are kept in
the sequences for producing better offspring and are
very likely to be included-in the final output.
We incorporated the results from the experiment
into the GA planner by using them as preferences
for evaluating RST trees. We treated inferrability
as an input to the system. If a good embedding can
be formed from two facts connected by an RST re-
lation (i.e. either of the two cases in Section 3.3.3
is satisfied and the required syntactic slot is free),
the embedding is scored higher than the hypotactic
realisation. However, this emphasis on embedding
might not be appropriate. In a real application en-
vironment, other communicative intentions should
be incorporated to balance the scoring for differ-
ent realisations. And generally, inferrability has to
be implemented based on limited domain-dependent
knowledge and user configuration.

5 Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973294117647">
This paper investigates the use of NR modifiers in
referring expressions to express certain semantic re-
lations. This is a commonly used strategy by human
authors, which has not been explored by an NLG
system before. Our experiment shows that when the
conditions for inferrability etc. are satisfied, certain
relations can be expressed through an NR construc-
tion as well as a normally used hypotactic construc-
tion with little difference in semantics. This facili-
tates for an NLG system a way of expressing these
semantic relations more concisely and subtly which
could not be achieved by other means.
Our experiment is restricted in many ways. One
possible extension is to use more cue phrases to cover
a wider range of cases for each semantic relation. In
reality, the application domain should decide which
relations need to be tested.

Their task is, given a set of facts and- relations b-etween facts, to produce a legal RST tree using all the facts and some relations. The text planning is basically a two step process. Firstly sequences of facts are generated by applying GA operators, and secondly the rhetorical structure trees built from these sequences are evaluated and the good sequences are kept for producing better offspring. 1 I 4 We extended the text planner by adding a GA operator called embedding mutation, which .randomly selects two items mentioning a common entity from a sequence and assumes an embedding on them.</context>

Halliday (1985) mentions that a subordinate clause can elaborate a part of its primary clause through restating, clarifying, refining or adding a descriptive attribute or comment (see (2) of Figure 1) Halliday&apos;s notion of elaboration is much more general than that in other coherence theories like RST (Mann -and • Thompson; 1987),. and -the relation- expressed in (2) would not be treated as elaboration in most NLG systems.

In this paper, an NR modifier refers to any NP modifying component that is not essential for identifying the object denoted by the head, including all modifiers of an NP that does not intend to identify (e.g. indefinite referring expressions and predicative phrases) (Kronfeld, 1990).

Thirdly, providing additional details about the referents of the NP, which functions the same way as the NP without these modifiers, e.g. those in (6c). The effect of such modifiers is usually local to the heads they describe rather than to the main propositions as a whole, which is the main difference between this and the second type of modifier. This type subsumes the modifiers normally generated by an aggregation module, in particular one using embedding (e.g. (Shaw and McKeown, 1997), (Cheng, 1998)).
