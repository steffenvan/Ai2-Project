This paper describes a novel approach to construct-
ing phonotactic models. The underlying theoretical
approach to phonological description is the multi-
syllable approach in which multiple syllable classes
are defined that reflect phonotactically idiosyncratic
syllable subcategories. A new finite-state formalism,
OFS Modelling, is used as a tool for encoding, au-
tomatically constructing and generalising phonotac-
tic descriptions. Language-independent prototype
models are constructed which are instantiated on the
basis of data sets of phonological strings, and gener-
alised with a clustering algorithm. The resulting ap-
proach enables the automatic construction of phono-
tactic models that encode arbitrarily close approxi-
mations of a language&apos;s set of attested phonological
forms. The approach is applied to the construction
of multi-syllable word-level phonotactic models for
German, English and Dutch.

<bodyText confidence="0.999757807692308">
Finite-state models of phonotactics have been
used in automatic language identification (Zissman,
1995; Belz, 2000), in speech recognition (Carson-
Berndsen, 1992; Jusek et al., 1994; Jusek et al.,
1996; Carson-Berndsen, 2000), and optical character
recognition, among other applications. While statis-
tical models (n-gram or Markov models) are derived
automatically from data, their symbolic equivalents
are usually constructed in a painstaking manual
process, and because based on standard single-
syllable phonological analyses tend to overgen-
eralise greatly over a language&apos;s set of wellformed
phonological strings. This paper describes methods
that enable the automatic construction of symbolic
phonotactic models that are more accurate represen-
tations of phonological grammars.
The underlying theoretical approach to phonolog-
ical description is the Multi-Syllable Approach (Belz,
1998; Belz, 2000). Syllable phonotactics vary consid-
erably not only in correlation with a syllable&apos;s posi-
tion within a word, but also with other factors such
as position relative to word stress. Analyses based
on multiple syllable classes defined to reflect such
factors can more accurately account for the phonolo-
gies of natural languages than analyses based on a
single syllable class.

described in Belz, 2000) is used as an encoding,
construction and generalisation tool, and facili-
tates Language-Independent Prototyping, where in-
completely specified generic models are constructed
for groups of languages and subsequently instanti-
ated and generalised automatically to fully spec-
ified, language-specific models using data sets of
phoneme strings from individual languages. The
theory-driven (manual) component in this construc-
tion method is restricted to specifying the maxi-
mum possible ways in which syllable phonotactics
may differ in a family of languages, without hard-
wiring the differences into the final models. The ac-
tual construction of models for individual languages
is a data-driven process and is done automatically.
Sets of German, English and Dutch syllables were
used extensively in the research described in this
paper, both as a source of evidence in support of
the multi-syllable approach (Section 2) and as data
in automatic phonotactic model construction (Sec-
tion 4). All syllable sets were derived from sets of
fully syllabified, phonetically transcribed forms col-
lected from the lexical database CELEX (Baayen et
al., 1995). CELEX contains compounds and phrases
as well as single words. Phonological words were de-
fined as any phonetic sequence with a single primary
stress marker, and all other entries were disregarded.

The multi-syllable approach works on the assump-
tion that single-syllable approaches cannot ade-
quately capture the phonological grammars of nat-
ural languages, because they fail to account for the
significant syllable-based phonotactic variation re-
sulting from a range of factors that is evident in
natural languages, and consequently overgeneralise
greatly.
Single-syllable analyses. The traditional view
is that all syllables in a language share the same
structure and compositional constraints which can

be captured by a single analysis. In many languages,
however, the sets of word-initial and/or word-final
consonant clusters differ significantly from other
consonantal clusters (Goldsmith, 1990, p. 107ff, lists
several examples from different languages). Such id-
iosyncratic clusters have been treated as &apos;termina-
tions&apos;, &apos;appendices&apos;, or as &apos;extrasyllabic&apos; (Goldsmith,
1990), and integrated along with syllables at the
word-level. Similar, apparently irregular phenom-
ena occur in correlation with tone and stress, and
the first and last vocalic segments in phonological
words are often analysed as &apos;extratonar and &apos;extra-
metrical&apos;. However, such apparent irregularities are
not restricted to the beginnings and ends of phono-
logical words, and the phonotactics of syllables are
affected by a range of factors other than position,
which are difficult if not impossible to account for
by the notion of extrasyllabicity.
Three problematic issues arise in single-syllable
analyses. Firstly, if a phonotactic model assumes
a single syllable class for a language, and if the
language has idiosyncratic word-initial and word-
final phonotactics, then the set of possible phono-
logical words that the model encodes is necessar-
ily too large, and includes words that form system-
atic (rather than accidental) gaps in the languages.
Secondly, if extrasyllabicity is used to account for
phonotactic idiosyncracies, then the resulting the-
ory of syllable structure fails to account for ev-
erything that it is intended to account for, and is
forced to integrate constituents that are not sylla-
bles (the extrasyllabic material) at the word level.
Thirdly, the notion of extrasyllabicity only works
for cases where phonemic material can be segmented
off adjacent syllables (most easily done at the begin-
nings and ends of words), and cannot be used to
account for syllable-internal variation. The alterna-
tive offered by multi-syllable analyses is to make the
universal assumption that position, stress and tone
(among other factors) will result in variation in syl-
lable phonotactics that are not necessarily restricted
to any particular part of words, and to account for
such variation systematically by the use of different
syllable classes.
Related approaches. The idea to discriminate
between different syllable types, classified by word
position and position with respect to the stressed
syllable has been explored and utilised in previous
research, for example in FSA-based phonotactic mod-
els, typed formalisms, and in stochastic production
rule grammars. Carson-Berndsen (1992) uses two
separate FsAs to encode the phonotactics of full and
reduced syllables, and Jusek et al. (1994) distin-
guish between stressed and unstressed syllables. In
a typed feature system of morpho-phonology, Mas-
troianni and Carpenter (1994) define subtypes of the
general type syllable.
The most closely related existing research is that
presented by Coleman and Pierrehumbert (1997).
The paper examines different possibilities for using
a probabilistic grammar for English words to model
native speakers&apos; acceptability judgments. The pro-
duction rule grammar encodes the phonotactics of
English monosyllabic and bisyllabic words. Differ-
ent probability distributions over paths in derivation
trees are investigated which model likelihood of ac-
ceptability to native speakers, rather than likelihood
of occurrence. To build a grammar that accounts
for interactions among onsets and rhymes, location
with respect to the word edge and word stress pat-
terns, six syllable types are distinguished which re-
flect possible combinations of the features strong,
weak, initial and final. The subsyllabic constituents
onset and rhyme are similarly marked for stress and
position.
The present research extends existing work on syl-
lable subclasses by applying the multi-syllable ap-
proach systematically to model the entire phono-
tactics of languages, and by using it for language-
independent prototyping (see Section 3.3 below).
Position-correlated phonotactic variation.

the size of its subset of syllables that do not occur in

syllables, or 16.4%, only occur word-initially). For
all three languages, the figures show significant

subsets. In German and Dutch, final syllables are
particularly idiosyncratic, with 30.3% and 24.54%,
respectively, not occurring in any other position. In
English, all syllable sets except the medial syllables
display a high degree of idiosyncracy. Table 2
shows the size of the intersections between the
syllable sets, and the more objective measure of
set similarity in brackets&apos;. In German and Dutch,
the similarity between initial and medial syllables,
and between final and monosyllables is particularly
high. The similarity between the least similar of
syllable sets is much greater in Dutch than in either
English or German. In English, only the final and
monosyllables display any significant similarity.
Average set similarity is highest in Dutch (0.37),
followed by German (0.28), and English (0.21).
Stress-correlated phonotactic variation. Ta-
ble 3 shows analogous statistics for phonotactic vari-
ation correlated with word stress. Set sizes and
unique subset sizes are shown for the set of sylla-
bles that carry primary stress (stressed), those im-
mediately preceding stress (pretonic), those imme-
diately following stress (posttonic), and all others
(plain). In all three languages, the set of stressed
syllables has least in common with other sets. In
English, this is closely followed by the pretonic syl-
lables. The average percentage of syllables unique
to a set is highest in English, followed by Dutch and
then German.
1Set similarity here is the standard measure of the size of
the intersection over the size of the union of two sets Si and
S2 or 1S1 n s21/Isi u S21 (not defined for Si = S2 = 0).
These statistics show not only that there is signifi-
cant syllable-level variation in the phonotactics of all
three languages, but also that the simple strategy of
subdividing the set of all syllables on the basis of po-
sition and stress succeeds in capturing at least some
of this variation. If a high percentage of syllables
in one subcategory do not occur in any other, then
distinguishing this syllable subcategory in a phono-
tactic model will help reduce overgeneralisation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999635">
The OFS Modelling formalism was used as a tool for
encoding, constructing and generalising phonotactic
models in the research described in Section 4. OFS
Modelling consists of three main components, (i) a
representation formalism, (ii) a mechanism for auto-
matic model construction, and (iii) mechanisms for
model generalisation. Brief summaries of the com-
ponents that were used in the research described in
this paper are given here (for full details see Belz,
2000).
Underlying OFS Modelling is a set of assump-
tions about linguistic description that shares many
of the fundamental tenets of declarative phonol-
ogy (Bird, 1991, for example). This set of as-
sumptions includes a strictly non-derivational, non-
transformational and constraint-based approach to
linguistic description, and the principle of constraint
inviolability.

The OFS formalism is a declarative, monostratal
finite-state representation formalism that is intu-
itively readable, facilitates the automatic data-
driven construction of models, and permits the in-
tegration of available prior, theoretical knowledge.
The derivations (trees or brackettings) defined by
OFS models correspond to context-free derivations
with a limited tree depth or degree of nesting of
brackets. This means that in OFS models (unlike
in other normal forms for regular grammars), rules
(hence expansions or brackets) can, if appropriately
defined, systematically correspond to standard lin-
guistic objects, the reason why the formalism is
called object-based.

OFS Models. The OFS representation formalism
is essentially a normal form for regular sets. OFS
models can be interpreted in the same way as stan-
dard production rule grammars, but are subject to
a set of additional constraints. An OFS model 0 is
denoted (N, T, P, n 1), where N is a finite set of
non-terminal objects O, 0 &lt; i &lt; n, and T is a fi-
nite set of terminals. P is an ordered finite set of
n sets of productions O w, where O E N, and

Og E N, i &gt; g, whereas for i = 0, w is a set of

sets of production rules, and each rule O is

number of repetitions of r, r+ denotes at least one repetition
of r, and r e denotes the disjunction of r and e.

uniquely associated with one of the levels. The nth
set of production rules is a singleton set {0&apos;01 41,
and 0&apos;01 is interpreted as the start symbol. The nota-
tional convention adopted for OFS models is as shown
in Figure 1.

Each rule 0 w in an OFS model corresponds to
a set of strings which will be referred to as an object
set or class, where 0 is the name of the object. The
production rules in OFS models will also be referred
to as object rules.
OFS models thus differ from standard production
rule grammars in three ways. Firstly, Russ of rules
above level 0 are arbitrary regular expressions4. Sec-
ondly, terminals from T are restricted to appear-
ing in the Russ of rules at level 0 (mostly to fa-
cilitate automatic model construction, see below).
Thirdly, OFS models are limited in their representa-
tional power to the finite-state domain by the con-
straints that the Russ of rules in rule sets at level
i &gt; 0 are regular expressions over non-terminals that
appear only in the Luss of rules in rule sets at lev-
els g &lt; i. That this limits representational power
to the regular languages can be seen from the fact
that all non-terminals O in the RHS of the single

top-level rule can be substituted iteratively with the
Russ of the corresponding rules O w. This it-
eration terminates after a finite time because there
is a finite number of levels in the model, and at this
point the RHS of the top-level rule contains only non-
terminals, i.e. is a regular expression, hence repre-
sents a regular language.
Unlike other normal forms for regular production-
rule grammars (such as left-linear and right-linear
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9481268">
10ther formalisms for linguistic analysis have permitted
full regular expressions in the RHSS of rules. For instance,
in syntactic grammars, the recursive nature of some types of
coordination has been modelled with right-recursive regular
expressions (e.g. in GPSG).

sets of production rules), OFS models enable the defi-
nition of production rules and hence derivations that
can, if appropriately defined, correspond to standard
linguistic objects and constituents (not possible in
linear grammars). Through the association of rules
with a finite number of levels, OFS models permit the
definition of grammars that encode sets of context-
free derivations up to a maximum depth equal to the
number of levels in the model.
The fact that non-terminal strings are in OFS mod-
els restricted to the lowest level, facilitates the com-
bined theory and data driven construction of models.
Uninstantiated models can be defined, that encode
what is known in advance about the structural regu-
larities of the object to be modelled in levels above 0,
and have under-specified level 0 Russ that are sub-
sequently instantiated on the basis of data sets of
examples of the object to be modelled. OFS Mod-
elling also has a generalisation procedure which can
be used to generalise fully instantiated OFS models.
Each of these mechanisms is described in turn over
the following paragraphs.
Uninstantiated OFS Models. In fully specified
OFS models (as defined in the preceding section),
the right-hand sides (Russ) of production rules at
level i are regular expressions for i &gt; 0, and string
sets for i = 0. This separation makes it simple to
construct incompletely specified models, or proto-
type OFS models, where the Russ of level 0 rules are
pattern descriptions rather than strings sets. Level 0
Russ in prototype models have the form C):&apos; Si,
where C):&apos; is the name of the object, and S, is a set
former {x : vxw E D, P2, . .P}, where v, w are
concatenations of variables, D refers to any given fi-
nite data set of strings, and P, 1 &lt; i &lt; n are prop-
erties of the variables in v and w.
Instantiation of Prototype OFS Models. The
OFS instantiation procedure takes a prototype OFS
model M for some linguistic object and a data set
D of example members of the corresponding object
class and proceeds as follows. For each level 0 rule
Si in M, and for each element x of D, all
substrings of x that match Si are collected. The
resulting set of substrings becomes the new RHS of
rule Q:). After instantiation, level 0 rules whose RHS
is the empty set are removed, as are rules at higher
levels whose Russ contain non-terminals that can no
longer be expanded by any of the production rules
in M.
Object-Set Generalisation. Instantiated OFS
models can be generalised by object-set (0s) gen-
eralisation, where pairs of level 0 object sets are
compared on the basis of a standard set similar-
ity measure sim for two finite sets Di and D2
(not defined for Di = D2 = 0): sim(D), D2) =
ID) n D2 1/1D1 U D21. The os-generalisation pro-
cedure takes a fully specified OFS model M and a
given similarity threshold T, and, applying a sim-
ple clustering algorithm, merges all object sets that
have a similarity value sim matching or exceeding
T. That is, the os-generalisation procedure mea-
sures the similarity between all pairs of level 0 sets,
and all pairs that match or exceed the threshold
end up in the same cluster. Finally, the old object
names (non-terminals) in the Russ of object rules
at levels above 0 are replaced with the Luss of the
corresponding new merged object rule, while all ob-
ject rules that now have identical Russ are in turn
merged. In this way, generalisation &apos;percolates&apos; up-
wards through the levels of the model.
Determining an appropriate value for the simi-
larity threshold T is not unproblematic. It could
be set in relation to the average similarity value in
an instantiated model (individually for each proto-
type instantiation), but this approach would obscure
the similarities that object-set generalisation (in par-
ticular in conjunction with LIP) is intended to ex-
ploit. The whole point of object-set generalisation
for language-independent prototypes is that it will
merge a different number of level 0 object classes in
different prototype instantiations, creating different
final, language-specific OFS models. If T is set in
proportion to the average similarity between level 0
classes, then this difference is reduced, and the re-
sulting models will tend to retain the same number
of level 0 object classes from the prototype. For ex-
ample, if the above prototype model Word is instan-
tiated to a data set from a language that has phono-
tactics which differ only between stressed and un-
stressed syllables, then all similarity values between
stressed syllable classes regardless of their position
within a word, and between all posttonic, pretonic
and plain syllables classes (again, regardless of posi-
tion), will be very high. The average similarity value
will therefore also be high. If T is set in relation to
this high average, not all unstressed and all stressed
syllable classes, respectively, will be merged, because
not all syllable classes can exceed average similarity.
Average similarity is a language-specific property,
and so is the number of syllable classes similar
enough to be merged for a given T value. For differ-
ent generalised instantiations of the same prototype
model to be comparable, object-set generalisation
must have been carried out for each of them with
the same T value.
The threshold T is best regarded as a variable pa-
rameter to the os-generalisation procedure that can
be used to control the degree to which a generalised
OFS model will fit the data: the higher T, the more
closely the model will fit the data, and the less it will
generalise over it. This is particularly appropriate in
phonotactic modelling, because phonotactics seeks
to encode not just the set of attested words, but also

syllable-level phonotactics in different languages can
be appropriately modelled by interpreting syllables
as a sequence of consonantal phonemes (onset), fol-
lowed by a sequence of vocalic phonemes (peak), and
another sequence of consonantal phonemes (coda).

section, a language-independent phonotactic proto-

4 Multi-Syllable Phonotactic Models
for German, English and Dutch
When applied to modelling multi-syllable word-level
phonotactics, LIP with OFS Modelling means defin-
ing the maximum possible number of syllable classes
that may be subject to different phonotactic con-
straints in a given group of languages. The exact
set of syllable classes depends on the group of lan-
guages the prototype is intended to cover as well as
the desired amount of generalisation over data (in
general, a model that distinguishes only two syllable
classes will generalise more than a model that distin-
guishes three or more classes, given the same data).
The prototype presented in this section is intended
to cover German, English and Dutch, and takes into
account only phonological factors (syntactic factors
such as word category which can also affect phono-
tactics are not taken into account). Two phonologi-
cal factors are modelled: position of a syllable within
a word, and position of a syllable relative to primary
word stress.
For this modelling task, the LIP approach is im-
plemented by constructing an OFS prototype model
in which syllable classes reflecting all possible differ-
ent combinations of position within a word and rel-
ative to stress are defined as level 0 uninstantiated
object rules, and all possible ways in which the cor-
responding objects can be combined to form words
are defined as higher-level object rules. No prior as-
sumptions about where phonotactic variation occurs
is hardwired into the model. Instead, the maximal
ways in which phonotactics may vary in a group of
languages is encoded. The idea is that prototype in-
stantiation and os-generalisation with data sets of
phonological words from different languages will re-
sult in different final, instantiated phonotactic mod-
els.

Table 4 shows the sizes of the different level 0 object
sets resulting from OFS model instantiations to the
German, English and Dutch word sets derived from
CELEX (the syllable sets are far too large to be shown
in their entirety). In all three languages, the largest
syllable set is the set of stressed monosyllables, and
the smallest is the set of medial pretonic syllables7.
Table 4 also shows (in the same format as in Sec-
tion 2) the number of syllables in each syllable class
that do not occur in any of the other classes.
In German and Dutch, percentages of unique syl-
lables are significantly lower than in the classes
reflecting position only and stress only that were
shown in Section 2, indicating that some of the
classes may not be worth distinguishing in phono-
tactic models. In English, however, the higher per-
centages of unique syllables are not far behind those
shown previously, indicating that most of the twelve

Some correlation is evident between the size of a
set and the percentage of unique syllables it contains.
In German, average syllable set size is 2, 754 and the
average percentage of unique syllables is 6.48%. Five
syllable sets are of above average size, and four of
these also have above-average percentages of unique
syllables. Seven syllable sets are below average in
size, and non of these have above-average percent-
ages of unique syllables. In English, the picture is
not as straightforward. Average syllable set size is
2, 717, and average percentage of unique syllables is
18.62%. Of the four sets of above-average size, two
have above-average, and two have below-average,
percentages of unique syllables. Of the seven En-
glish syllable sets of below-average size (the set of
plain monosyllables is disregarded again for English
and Dutch), two have above-average, and five have
below-average percentages of unique syllables. Fi-
nally, in Dutch, average set size is 3, 449 and aver-
age percentage of unique syllables is 6.33%. Four
of the six above-average sized sets also have above-
average percentages of unique syllables, while all of
the below-average sized sets also have below-average
percentages of unique syllables. However, there is no
complete correlation, with some of the largest sets
having very small percentages of unique syllables,
and vice versa.

progressively finer grained subcategories of syllables,
progressively closer approximations of the set of at-
tested forms can be achieved.
However, doing this in an indiscriminate,
language-independent way may produce some syl-
lable classes that are very similar. With os-
generalisation, the most similar classes can be
merged, so that only strongly marked differences are
preserved. However, setting T to any specific value
is problematic. Producing cluster trees with a range
of T values can give some idea of important class dis-
tinctions, and can be used as a basis for determining
an appropriate T value. T can further be motivated
by different linguistic assumptions and the intended
purpose of the generalised models. Generalising dif-
ferent instantiations of the same prototype for the
same T value, makes it possible to compare the rela-
tive markedness of phonotactic variation in different
languages.

This paper described how OFS modelling and
the multi-syllable approach can be combined
with language-independent prototyping to create a
method for designing phonotactic models that (i) fa-
cilitates automatic model construction, (ii) produces
models that are arbitrarily close approximations of
the set of wellformed phonological words in a given

with control over the degree to which final models
fit given data. Extensions of the approach currently
under investigation include stochastic OFS models,

The actual construction of models for individual languages is a data-driven process and is done automatically. Sets of German, English and Dutch syllables were used extensively in the research described in this paper, both as a source of evidence in support of the multi-syllable approach (Section 2) and as data in automatic phonotactic model construction (Section 4). All syllable sets were derived from sets of fully syllabified, phonetically transcribed forms collected from the lexical database CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995). CELEX contains compounds and phrases as well as single words. Phonological words were defined as any phonetic sequence with a single primary stress marker, and all other entries were disregarded. 2 Multi-Syllable Phonotactics The multi-syllable approach works on the assumption that single-syllable approaches cannot adequately capture the phonological grammars of natural languages, because they fail to account for the significant syllable-based phonotactic variation resulting from a range of factors that is evident in natural languages, and consequently overgeneralise greatly.

This paper describes methods that enable the automatic construction of symbolic phonotactic models that are more accurate representations of phonological grammars.

Language-independent prototype models are constructed which are instantiated on the basis of data sets of phonological strings, and generalised with a clustering algorithm. The resulting approach enables the automatic construction of phonotactic models that encode arbitrarily close approximations of a language&apos;s set of attested phonological forms. The approach is applied to the construction of multi-syllable word-level phonotactic models for German, English and Dutch. 1 Introduction Finite-state models of phonotactics have been used in automatic language identification (Zissman, 1995; Belz, 2000), in speech recognition (CarsonBerndsen, 1992; Jusek et al., 1994; Jusek et al., 1996; Carson-Berndsen, 2000), and optical character recognition, among other applications. While statistical models (n-gram or Markov models) are derived automatically from data, their symbolic equivalents are usually constructed in a painstaking manual process, and because based on standard singlesyllable phonological analyses tend to overgeneralise greatly over a language&apos;s set of wellformed phonological strings.

The underlying theoretical approach to phonological description is the Multi-Syllable Approach (Belz, 1998; Belz, 2000). Syllable phonotactics vary considerably not only in correlation with a syllable&apos;s position within a word, but also with other factors such as position relative to word stress. Analyses based on multiple syllable classes defined to reflect such factors can more accurately account for the phonologies of natural languages than analyses based on a single syllable class. Object-Based Finite State Modelling (previously described in Belz, 2000) is used as an encoding, construction and generalisation tool, and facilitates Language-Independent Prototyping, where incompletely specified generic models are constructed for groups of languages and subsequently instantiated and generalised automatically to fully specified, language-specific models using data sets of phoneme strings from individual languages. The theory-driven (manual) component in this construction method is restricted to specifying the maximum possible ways in which syllable phonotactics may differ in a family of languages, without hardwiring the differences into the final</context>

OFS Modelling consists of three main components, (i) a representation formalism, (ii) a mechanism for automatic model construction, and (iii) mechanisms for model generalisation. Brief summaries of the components that were used in the research described in this paper are given here (for full details see Belz, 2000). Underlying OFS Modelling is a set of assumptions about linguistic description that shares many of the fundamental tenets of declarative phonology (Bird, 1991, for example). This set of assumptions includes a strictly non-derivational, nontransformational and constraint-based approach to linguistic description, and the principle of constraint inviolability. 48 The OFS formalism is a declarative, monostratal finite-state representation formalism that is intuitively readable, facilitates the automatic datadriven construction of models, and permits the integration of available prior, theoretical</context>
