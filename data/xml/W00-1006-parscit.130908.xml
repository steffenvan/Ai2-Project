<bodyText confidence="0.993573785714286">
Coherence relations have usually
been taken to link clauses and larger
units. After arguing that some
phrases can be seen as discourse
units, a computational account for
such phrases is presented that inte-
grates surface-based criteria with in-
ferential ones. This approach can be
generalized to treat intra-sentential
cue-phrases. Since cue-phrases are
not always present, referential rela-
tions between nominal expressions
are additionally used to derive a
text&apos;s discourse structure.

It is widely acknowledged that texts are not
just collections of sentences, but have a struc-
ture of their own. There has been substan-
tial work in order to account for the different
phenomena of discourse structure by apply-
ing theories of coherence relations, e.g. (Mann
and Thompson, 1988; Asher, 1993) among
others. Coherence relations represent rich se-
mantic linkage (like Cause&apos; or Evaluation)
between text segments of varying size.
However, what the minimum size of text
segments to relate should be, is still left open
to debate. As common approaches argue
that coherence relations relate events or situ-
ations (e.g. (Hobbs et al., 1993; Asher, 1993))
and that such events are usually introduced
&apos;Coherence relations in this paper are basically
taken from taken Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann
and Thompson, 1988) will appear emphasized and
Capitalized.
through the means of verbs, it has become
standard practice to consider clauses to be
the appropriate size for elementary discourse
units. It has, however, also been observed
(Vander Linden and Martin, 1995; Grote et
al., 1997) that sometimes phrases may serve
as very condensed forms to express elaborate
contents. Recently, (Schauer and Hahn, 2000)
provided a more detailed analysis when prepo-
sitional phrases (PPs) may serve as elemen-
tary discourse units.
Cursorily viewed, the claims of another re-
cent study stand in contrast to the idea of
intra-clausal discourse units: (Schauer, 2000)
examined the interplay of coreferential ex-
pressions and discourse structure and con-
cluded that referential relations are a good
indicator of the discourse structural configu-
rations in case the units examined are entire
sentences. This poses the question whether
not entire sentences are the appropriate grain
size for elementary discourse units.
I will argue that these results - i.e. the dif-
ferent levels of granularity for discourse units
- are not incompatible with each other. The
approach used in (Schauer and Hahn, 2000)
to derive the coherence relation governing a
prepositional phrase neatly carries over to the
computation of coherence relations signaled
by sentence-internal cue-phrases. This then
allows an integration with the algorithm us-
ing referential relations that was proposed in
(Schauer, 2000).

2 Adjuncts as Discourse Units

The question at what size of textual expres-
sions one should start looking for discourse
units has not been sufficiently answered yet.

(Mann and Thompson, 1988), for example,
state that &amp;quot;Unit size is arbitrary, but the di-
vision of the text should be based on some
theory-neutral classification. That is, for in-
teresting results, the units should have inde-
pendent functional integrity. In our analy-
ses, units are basically clauses [... ]&amp;quot; [p.248].
It has been noted previously that sometimes
phrases already seem to have enough &amp;quot;func-
tional integrity&amp;quot; to give some &amp;quot;interesting re-
sults&amp;quot;, however, until recently there has been
no detailed proposal what kind of phrases
should be considered.
Consider the following (German) example:2

A straightforward coherence analysis with
relations from RST (Mann and Thompson,
1988) takes (1-b) as a single unit and links
it to (1-a), probably via an Evaluation re-
lation. Paraphrasing sentence (1-b) reveals,
however, a plausible decomposition into two
interdependent discourse units:

Clause (2-a) gives an Explanation for the
subordinate clause (2-b). This might be at-
tributed to the impact of the cue word &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;
in (2-b). More generally, it has been claimed
that whenever an implicit coherence relation
can be made explicit by a paraphrase incor-
porating a specific cue word, then this coher-
ence relation can always be assumed to hold.3
So, from a methodological point of view it

2In the following, I will summarize the arguments
from (Schauer and Hahn, 2000) that focus on prepo-
sitional phrases.
3&amp;quot;As a test for the presence of an implicit connec-
tion it can be required that the connection could have
been explicit... &amp;quot;(Martin, 1992, p.184)

<bodyText confidence="0.999788688888889">
cannot be justified to analyze Sentence (2)
as being composed of two elementary units,
while the prepositional phrase &amp;quot;with one PCI
slot&amp;quot; should be an indistinguishable part of
the whole Sentence (1-b).
Obviously, not all kind of phrases may serve
as elementary units. As a first criterion to de-
termine whether a phrase is a discourse unit,
we propose to consider only those phrases
that are not syntactically mandatory com-
plements of their governing syntactic head.
Complements are assumed to be specified in
terms of subcategorization frames, valency
lists, etc. Adjuncts are phrases which do
not match such a complement specification of
their governing syntactic head.
In Example (1-b), while it is both possi-
ble to omit the optional prepositional phrase
&amp;quot;with one PCI slot&amp;quot; and to decompose the
sentence such that the prepositional phrase
turns into a proper clause, this is only hardly
possible for any other phrase in this example,
say the subject &amp;quot;the motherboard&amp;quot;.
The second major criterion operates at the
semantic level. Semantic specifications of lex-
emes, independent of the specific semantic
theory one subscribes to, are confined to &amp;quot;typ-
ical&amp;quot; properties, e.g., events are character-
ized by agents, patients, instruments, loca-
tions, time frames, etc. The interpretation
of phrases referring to these attributes can
be taken care of by straightforward semantic
interpretation mechanisms. As long as the
interpretation makes reference only to such
&amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; properties it is not necessary to con-
sider such phrases as discourse units. But
when an analyst thinks that the interpreta-
tion involves (additional) non-typical, unpre-
dictable information, coherence relations may
capture their value-adding meaning.4 E.g.,
the prepositional phrase of (1-a) only refers
to a such typical property, namely the instru-
ment of an action. This typicality considera-
tion does not carry over to an &amp;quot;explanation&amp;quot;
of events, which is the interpretation of &amp;quot;with
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.84844525">
4The interpretation of complements is assumed to
involve only these typical attributes. The interpreta-
tion of adjuncts, in contrast, may refer to both typical
and non-typical information.

one PCI slot&amp;quot; from Sentence (1-b).
Ultimately, however, there is also a third
criterion that needs to be considered: namely,
that a coherence relation can be found by
which the phrase may be related to the re-
mainder of the clause it occurs in (Marcu et
al., 1999). We propose that this search for
an applicable coherence relation may be per-
formed by trying to paraphrase the phrase
and its matrix clause in such a way that it
results in two clauses that are related by a
cue-phrase.
(Schauer and Hahn, 2000) evaluated the
applicability of the criteria by human anno-
tators using two corpora. We found that
11.0% of the prepositional phrases in a Ger-
man text corpus can be seen as discourse units
and 8.0% in an English control set. These
PPs are responsible for 14.8% and 12.1%, re-
spectively, of the relations found in the texts.
The discourse units triggered by prepositional
phrases always occur in satellite (i.e. subordi-
nate) position, which is not surprising, given
their status of optional information.

3 From Prepositional Phrases to
Coherence Relations

For an automated coherence analysis, we will
basically take the preposition as a trigger for
computing a coherence relation. To make
this discussion more concrete, it is embed-
ded in the framework of SYNDIKATE, a text
analysis system under development in our lab
(Hahn and Romacker, 1999).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998638">
3.1 Semantic Interpretation

<bodyText confidence="0.997861763157895">
Crucial for the discussion here is that the syn-
tactic analysis provided by the system allows
to distinguish between adjuncts and manda-
tory complements: for Sentence (1-b), a de-
pendency relation ppadj between the prepo-
sitional phrase and its governing syntactic
head is derived, that results from the valency
specification for the main verb &amp;quot;bietet&amp;quot; (pro-
vide). For computing a semantic interpre-
tation6 , the corresponding conceptual corre-
lates of the content words are then checked

for role compatibility.
In Example (1-b), the major interpretation
constraints derive from the main verb &amp;quot;bi-
etet&amp;quot; (provide) which is represented by the
concept PROVIDE. It has three major concep-
tual roles, PROVIDE-PATIENT, PROVIDE-CO-
PATIENT, and INSTRUMENT. The PROVIDE-
PATIENT and PROVIDE-CO-PATIENT roles can
be filled by some instance of MOTHERBOARD
and SPACE, respectively.
Focusing on the analysis of the PP, each
preposition specifies allowed semantic rela-
tions (Romacker et al., 1999). In the case
of &amp;quot;mit&amp;quot; (with) they allow an interpretation
in terms of the conceptual INSTRUMENT role,
so the corresponding role of PROVIDE is filled
with PCI-SLOT. This causes additional con-
ceptual interpretation processes: a production
rule checks whether the filler of the INSTRU-
MENT role may be a PART-OF the concep-
tual correlate of the syntactic subject, link-
ing SPACE and MOTHERBOARD. Along the
line, a HAS-PART-STATE is established that
corresponds to the situation that &amp;quot;the moth-
erboard has one PCI slot&amp;quot;.6

3.2 Discourse Interpretation

<bodyText confidence="0.963526695652174">
As discussed above, a preposition does not
always signal a coherence relation. Also, a
preposition may give rise to different coher-
ence relations depending on context, so one
can not simply paste a label of &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; coher-
ence relation into the representation. Instead,
the computation of coherence relations is per-
formed by testing relation-specific constraints
on the configuration of the text-knowledge
base resulting from semantic interpretation.
Following standard practice, coherence rela-
tions are assumed to connect situations. So,
we try to derive the relation between the
conceptual correlate PROVIDE of the main
verb and the inferred state HAS-PART-STATE,
which stems from the conceptual interpreta-
tion of the prepositional phrase.
6In case that the sentence &amp;quot;the motherboard has
one PCI slot&amp;quot; would have been parsed, the PART-OF
relation would have been derived via a production
rule operating on the interpretation of the main verb
&amp;quot;has&amp;quot;. Thus, establishing the HAS-PART-STATE in Ex-
ample (1-b) yields a uniform analysis.

The preposition &amp;quot;mit&amp;quot; (with) may signal an
Explanation. The basis for computing this re-
lation consists in recognizing that the matrix
clause gives some kind of evaluation: namely,
that the &amp;quot;motherboard provides only little
space.&amp;quot;. The degree expression SPACE, with
its associated negative POL-MARKER, (Staab
and Hahn, 1997) is the trigger for recognizing
the evaluative status of the matrix clause. We
can now start looking for the signalled Expla-
nation for this negative judgment.
Explanation can be found quite easily: usu-
ally, a MOTHERBOARD has up to four PCI-
SLOTS (see the default value that is denoted at
the PART-OF relation in Figure 1). But actu-
ally the situation HAS-PART-STATE is a state
in which only one is present, which is obvi-
ously &amp;quot;little&amp;quot;. The computations that derive
the Explanation-relation are all performed by
means of production rules.
As a preposition might give rise to differ-
ent coherence relations, the constraints of all
those relations have to be checked. None of
the constraints that are checked for other co-
herence relations signaled by &amp;quot;mit&amp;quot; (e.g. (Jon-
dition) are satisfiable in this example. Sim-
ilarly, for Example (1-a) no coherence rela-
tion would be derived, because the constraints
would not be appicable. So, the compu-
tational approach is complementary to the
semantic criterion of typicallity discussed in
Section 2.

4 Interclausal Coherence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999655625">
The proposed mechanism essentially treats
the preposition as a kind of cue-phrase that
determines a set of possible coherence rela-
tions, combining it with a inference mecha-
nism. The main advantage of using such a
combination is that it is possible to disam-
biguate cases in which cue-phrases may give
rise to different relations without being con-
fined to testing the complete range of Co-
-herence relations. This problem is not re-
stricted to prepositions: (Knott and Sanders,
1998) actually build a multi-taxonomy of cue-
phrases in which elements may give rise to
several relations, depending on context. E.g.,
&amp;quot;as&amp;quot; has three connotations: &amp;quot;as&amp;quot; may signal
temporal, causal or similarity relationship.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997358">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997397695652174">
The presented approach carries over neatly
to such cue-phrases with multiple relations:
indeed, the process described in Section 3
can be seen as a formal reconstruction of the
paraphrase. The conceptual representations
that is derived for Sentence (2) is basically
the same as for (1-b): in both cases a HAS-
PART-STATE and a PART-OF relation are com-
puted that connects the MOTHERBOARD and
its PCI-SLOT. Finally, the computation of
the coherence relation for Sentence (2) differs
only with respect to the trigger: in Sentence
(2), the cue-phrase &amp;quot;so&amp;quot; triggers the computa-
tion instead of the preposition &amp;quot;mit&amp;quot; in (1-b).
The presented approach is thus able to han-
dle coherence relations that operate on the
intra-sentential level. Still, this is only a first
step to account for the discourse structure
of entire texts: cue-phrases are by no means
always present. And even if there is a cue-
phrase in a new unit to attach, it is still often
not clear from the cue alone to which unit the
new one should connect:

<bodyText confidence="0.99993">
The cue &amp;quot;however&amp;quot; alone does not give
enough information to decide whether Sen-
tence (3-c) should connect to (3-b) or to (3-a):
further information is needed, like that there
is a referential relation between the old Mes-
sagePad 120 and the MessagePad family. As
a step towards connecting larger units, a re-
cent study (Schauer, 2000) examined the in-
teraction of discourse structure and referen-
tial relations among nominal expressions.

4.1 Structural Dependencies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955777777778">
What seems intuitively clear, is that a theory
of discourse structure should reflect the struc-
ture of the text under consideration. Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory, however, concentrates
on the effects intended by the author of a text.
RST focuses on a &amp;quot;pre-realizational&amp;quot; struc-
ture and is not primarily concerned with text
phenomena. The results are analyses that do
not account for the structural constraints in a
text, here referential constraints: the depen-
dency of an anaphoric expression on its an-
tecedent - that it is resolvable and hence in-
terpretable - can hardly be captured in RST.
While this is of course not an issue for RST
as a theory, it is a prerequisite for any sys-
tem that wants to account automatically for
a text&apos;s discourse structure. As an example
consider the following fragment:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9296835">
(4) a. The Vaio F190 comes with convincing
equipment.
b. It features a DVD-ROM and a 6 GB
harddisk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97189075">
In classical RST, example (4-a) could be said
to stand in an Evaluation relation to (4-b).
The definition of Evaluation requires that the
satellite evaluates the nucleus, see Figure 2.7
However, this would not capture a structural
dependency: the pronominal anaphora &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;
cannot be interpreted correctly without the
antecedent, so (4-b) depends on (4-a).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999539">
Figure 2: Structure of Evaluation
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9897210625">
In RST, one could reflect this referential
dependency by analyzing (4-b) as giving Evi-
dence for (4-a) (see Figure 3), as an Evidence
relation may be applied when the hypothesis
is the nucleus. Such an analysis would ne-
glect the &amp;quot;convincing&amp;quot; in (4-a) which is quite
an explicit evaluation.
In order to account for the structural
dependency and the appropriate semantic
linkage, we propose to use a new kind of
Evaluation-N(ucleus) relation. More gener-
ally, this loosens the relation between nucleus-
satellite assignment and semantic content of
coherence relations.

schemata. The target of the arrow marks the nucleus.

4.2 Structural Configurations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915214285714">
Analyzing texts using the outlined notion
of structural dependencies as a basic guide-
line, we determined the structural configu-
rations involving coreference relations. Ba-
sically, when two units contain coreferential
expressions, they are usually connected by
a coherence relation which subordinates the
anaphoric unit. In the simplest case, the re-
lation is one of Elaboration. However, further
linguistic cues or inferences might give rise to
semantically &amp;quot;richer&amp;quot; relations.
When more than one coreference relation
is involved, issues become more complex. For
instance, consider the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.897680285714286">
(5) a. The Panasonic LC9OS is a 19&amp;quot;-display.

d. The device can be attached to a video-
card via a USB-connector.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694294117647">
Obviously, the nominal anaphor &amp;quot;the device&amp;quot;
in (5-d) requires an antecedent. One possi-
bility would be the pronominal &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in (5-b),
leading to a resolution to &amp;quot;the LC90S&amp;quot;. How-
ever, this is not reflected in the discourse
structure that seems most appropriate, cf.
Figure 4. The topic of (5-b) and (5-c) (the
size) is not further elaborated on in (5-d), so
one might say there is a mini-segment bound-
ary between these two sentences. Hence, it
would also be not correct to analyze (5-d) as
an Elaboration of (5a-c), because (5-d) elab-
orates only (5-a). So, unless further connec-
tions (stemming from cue-phrases, inferences
or whatever) license a topic continuation, a
new unit containing anaphora will connect to
the upmost unit bearing their antecedents.

The configurations just described naturally
lead to a combined account of deriving a
text&apos;s discourse structure and resolving its re-
ferring expressions, repeated from (Schauer,
2000) in Figure 5. Basically, the algorithm
uses the successful resolution of anaphoric ex-
pressions as a guideline for determining the
target unit to which a new unit should be
connected which in turn restricts the set of
units which should be searched for resolving
further referring expressions.
The algorithm assumes the availability of
several capabilities for anaphora resolution.
First, for a given unit candidates a set of noun
phrases needs to be identified that may be
anaphoric expressions. Second, some resolu-
tion process is necessary that checks whether
an anaphoric expression can be resolved in a
given list of possible antecedents. This pro-
cess makes heavy use of underlying (domain)
knowledge (Hahn et al., 1996): in Exam-
ple (1), &amp;quot;the P6LXZ-A&amp;quot; is an instance of a
MOTHERBOARD. Since &amp;quot;the motherboard&amp;quot; in
(1-a) is a definite noun phrase and syntactic
as well as conceptual information match with
the plausible antecedent &amp;quot;the P6LXZ-A&amp;quot;, a
referential link can be established, see the Is-
COREFERENTIAL relation in Figure 6.

The algorithm now loops through all
clauses of a text, building up both the tree
and the antecedent lists incrementally. When-
ever a new clause has to be considered, its left
context consisting of the right frontier of the
tree is checked for plausible antecedents.
When all accessible antecedent nodes are
determined, the highest node that provides
antecedents for all resolvable anaphoric ex-
pressions in the new unit is taken as the tar-
get node, in accordance with the discussion in
Section 4.2.
If a new unit contains no referential expres-
sion then the algorithm makes no prediction.
If the target node has been found, the new
unit is connected to it, i.e. the new unit is es-
tablished as a satellite to the target unit. This
means that the new unit opens a new right-
most branch and hence becomes the lowest-
right node of the tree. So, the new right fron-
tier consists of the newly attached unit, the

The evaluation in (Schauer, 2000) showed
that the predictions made by the algorithm
depend crucially on the size of the elementary
units considered. When clauses are consid-
ered to be the elementary unit size, the pre-
dictions are correct in up to 81% of the cases
in which the algorithm makes a prediction —
under the pre-condition that intra-sentential
units are handled first. Linking units by ref-
erential makes surely no sense when the units
considered are phrases: of course, syntactic
constraints always mandate that intra-clausal
units are related with each other first.
This algorithm is only a useful approxima-

discourse structure. Relating to the highest
unit providing antecedents works only when
there is a mini segment boundary every time
an anaphoric expression is used. Although
the algorithm ignores other sources of rela-
tions between units — which are exactly the
cases where the algorithm fails — the results
are surprisingly good. As such, enhancing
the cue-phrase-only approach by additionally
considering coreference relations is in the mid-

Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) was basically used as the
theory on which the presented arguments
were grounded. Unfortunately, its definitions
are intended to be applied by human anno-
tators and have long resisted approaches to
automation because of their vagueness. Pre-
vious approaches to (automatically) deriv-
ing a text&apos;s discourse structure either tried
to rely on purely surface-based criteria (cue-
phrases, (Marcu, 1998)) or concentrated on
inferences about representations of discourse
units (Asher, 1993; Hobbs et al., 1993). How-
ever, neither of these approaches tries to ac-
count for phrases as discourse units. Two re-

cent studies mention the role of PPs as carri-
ers of coherence relations (Vander Linden and
Martin, 1995; Grote et al., 1997), but only for
the purpose of text generation.
As prepositions (and cue-phrases in gen-
eral) can signal different coherence relations,
the presented computational approach cou-
ples a cue-phrase approach like (Marcu, 1998)
with inferences using the computed seman-
tic representation. Only recently, there have
been some approaches (Webber et al., 1999)
that acknowledge the need to incorporate
both a treatment of cue-phrase approaches
and inferences. However, how these inferences
take place is not addressed, neither is the level
of intraclausal coherence, that, as we have ar-
gued, substantially relies on an integration of
both veins. Purely inferential approaches like
(Asher, 1993; Hobbs et al., 1993) have also
been criticized for being not really applica-
ble because of computational costs. The pre-
sented approach tries to minimize these costs
by relying on surface-based criteria that re-
duce the set of coherence relations that have
to be considered.

Cue-phrases are not necessarily alone re-
sponsible for the discourse structure of texts.
Hence, referential relations between nominal
expressions were suggested as means for find-
ing attachment points of new units that need
to be incorporated. (Corston-Oliver, 1998)
enlarges the cue-phrase approach of (Marcu,
1998) in a vein similar to the one presented
in Section 5. However, how several corefer-
ence relations interact with the resulting dis-
course structure, is not spelled out. Also, in
his approach, it remains unclear how the cor-
rect target node to attach to is identified.

ory (SDRT), as described in (Asher, 1993),
provides a framework of discourse structure
which interacts with referential accessibility
constraints. Asher does not rely on coref-
erences for establishing target units; instead
the derivation of a coherence relation (and
thereby of the target unit to connect a new
unit to) relies on rather abstract connections
between &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;. While recognizing corefer-
ence relations certainly also requires domain
knowledge and inference capabilities, recog-
nizing connections between events seems an
even more impossible task. The presented ap-
proach is hence more light-weight in nature.
(Webber et al., 1999) apply operations
on trees for incorporating cue-phrases in a
grammar-driven approach to discourse struc-
ture. The presented algorithm could be in-
tegrated with their approach, to account for
the cases of units that are not connected by
referential relations but via cue-phrases.

<bodyText confidence="0.998667737704918">
Starting from the question what are the el-
ementary units to consider for a text&apos;s dis-
course structure, I presented an account for
prepositional phrases with adjunct-status as
discourse units. Prepositions can be seen as
a kind of cue-phrase; however, a preposition
does not necessarily signal a coherence re-
lation and even if it does is often ambigu-
ous with regard to the coherence relation sig-
naled. Therefore accounting for prepositional
phrases as discourse units requires additional
inferences operating on the semantic repre-
sentation of both PP and its matrix clause.
The approach neatly carries over to the
phenomena of ambiguous cue-phrases. How-
ever, this is still not sufficient to account for
deriving the discourse structure of texts in
general: cue-phrases are by no means always
present and even if there is a cue-phrase, de-
tecting the correct attachment point of a new
unit is usually not straight-forward.
As (one step towards) a solution, ref-
erential relations between nominal expres-
sions were suggested. The presented algo-
rithm integrates the resolution of anaphora
— which also depends heavily on inferences
and domain-knowledge — with choosing the
target unit to which a new unit should con-
nect to: namely, the highest node provid-
ing antecedents to all anaphoric expressions
in the new unit. In order for this algorithm
to operate successful, it is however necessary
that this process is started only after all phe-
nomena of intra-sentential coherence relations
have been accounted for, which might be done
using the combined approach outlined above.
Returning to the question posed at the be-
ginning of the paper - what is the appropri-
ate size of elementary discourse units - the
answer is twofold: first of all, coherence re-
lations can be found to hold between phrases
and the clause containing them, so one should
indeed start looking for discourse units at the
phrase level. However, Syntax requires that
the components of sentences group together,
and returning to what (Mann and Thompson,
1988) said, sentences have a kind of functional
integrity - one that operates on a level that
is different from those of phrases. Once this
level is reached, larger chunks can be formed,
e.g. by referential means.
The presented approach to cue-phrases as
well as the use of referential relations will
be implemented in the text understanding
system SYNDIKATE (Hahn and Romacker,
1999), in order to account for semantically
rich relations between larger text chunks and
the discourse structure of texts in general.
This, however, will require further under-
standing of the conditions of the coherence
relations involved.

The discourse units triggered by prepositional phrases always occur in satellite (i.e. subordinate) position, which is not surprising, given their status of optional information. 3 From Prepositional Phrases to Coherence Relations For an automated coherence analysis, we will basically take the preposition as a trigger for computing a coherence relation. To make this discussion more concrete, it is embedded in the framework of SYNDIKATE, a text analysis system under development in our lab (Hahn and Romacker, 1999). 3.1 Semantic Interpretation Crucial for the discussion here is that the syntactic analysis provided by the system allows to distinguish between adjuncts and mandatory complements: for Sentence (1-b), a dependency relation ppadj between the prepositional phrase and its governing syntactic head is derived, that results from the valency specification for the main verb &amp;quot;bietet&amp;quot; (provide).

The algorithm assumes the availability of several capabilities for anaphora resolution. First, for a given unit candidates a set of noun phrases needs to be identified that may be anaphoric expressions. Second, some resolution process is necessary that checks whether an anaphoric expression can be resolved in a given list of possible antecedents. This process makes heavy use of underlying (domain) knowledge (Hahn et al., 1996): in Example (1), &amp;quot;the P6LXZ-A&amp;quot; is an instance of a MOTHERBOARD. Since &amp;quot;the motherboard&amp;quot; in (1-a) is a definite noun phrase and syntactic as well as conceptual information match with the plausible antecedent &amp;quot;the P6LXZ-A&amp;quot;, a referential link can be established, see the IsCOREFERENTIAL relation in Figure 6.

So, the computational approach is complementary to the semantic criterion of typicallity discussed in Section 2. 4 Interclausal Coherence The proposed mechanism essentially treats the preposition as a kind of cue-phrase that determines a set of possible coherence relations, combining it with a inference mechanism. The main advantage of using such a combination is that it is possible to disambiguate cases in which cue-phrases may give rise to different relations without being confined to testing the complete range of Co-herence relations. This problem is not restricted to prepositions: (Knott and Sanders, 1998) actually build a multi-taxonomy of cuephrases in which elements may give rise to several relations, depending on context. E.g., &amp;quot;as&amp;quot; has three connotations: &amp;quot;as&amp;quot; may signal temporal, causal or similarity relationship. 49 The presented approach carries over neatly to such cue-phrases with multiple relations: indeed, the process described in Section 3 can be seen as a formal reconstruction of the paraphrase. The conceptual representations that is derived for Sentence (2) is basically the same as for (1-b): in both cases a HASPART-STATE and a PART-OF relation are computed that connects the MOTHE</context>

This approach can be generalized to treat intra-sentential cue-phrases. Since cue-phrases are not always present, referential relations between nominal expressions are additionally used to derive a text&apos;s discourse structure. 1 Introduction It is widely acknowledged that texts are not just collections of sentences, but have a structure of their own. There has been substantial work in order to account for the different phenomena of discourse structure by applying theories of coherence relations, e.g. (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Asher, 1993) among others.

The approach used in (Schauer and Hahn, 2000) to derive the coherence relation governing a prepositional phrase neatly carries over to the computation of coherence relations signaled by sentence-internal cue-phrases. This then allows an integration with the algorithm using referential relations that was proposed in (Schauer, 2000). 2 Adjuncts as Discourse Units The question at what size of textual expressions one should start looking for discourse units has not been sufficiently answered yet. 46 (Mann and Thompson, 1988), for example, state that &amp;quot;Unit size is arbitrary, but the division of the text should be based on some theory-neutral classification. That is, for interesting results, the units should have independent functional integrity. In our analyses, units are basically clauses [... ]&amp;quot; [p.248]. It has been noted previously that sometimes phrases already seem to have enough &amp;quot;functional integrity&amp;quot; to give some &amp;quot;interesting results&amp;quot;, however, until recently there has been no detailed proposal what kind of phrases should be considered. Consider the following (German) example:2 (1) a. Mit dem P6LXZ-A versuc</context>

Returning to the question posed at the beginning of the paper - what is the appropriate size of elementary discourse units - the answer is twofold: first of all, coherence relations can be found to hold between phrases and the clause containing them, so one should indeed start looking for discourse units at the phrase level. However, Syntax requires that the components of sentences group together, and returning to what (Mann and Thompson, 1988) said, sentences have a kind of functional integrity - one that operates on a level that is different from those of phrases. Once this level is reached, larger chunks can be formed, e.g. by referential means. The presented approach to cue-phrases as well as the use of referential relations will be implemented in the text understanding system SYNDIKATE (Hahn and Romacker, 1999), in order to account for semantically rich relations between larger text chunks and the discourse structure of texts in general. This, however, will require further understanding of the conditions of the coherence relati</context>

The presented approach tries to minimize these costs by relying on surface-based criteria that reduce the set of coherence relations that have to be considered. 53 Cue-phrases are not necessarily alone responsible for the discourse structure of texts. Hence, referential relations between nominal expressions were suggested as means for finding attachment points of new units that need to be incorporated. (Corston-Oliver, 1998) enlarges the cue-phrase approach of (Marcu, 1998) in a vein similar to the one presented in Section 5. However, how several coreference relations interact with the resulting discourse structure, is not spelled out. Also, in his approach, it remains unclear how the correct target node to attach to is identified. Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT), as described in (Asher, 1993), provides a framework of discourse structure which interacts with referential accessibility constraints. Asher does not rely on coreferences for establishing target units; instead the derivation of a coherence relation (and thereby of the target unit to co</context>

As a step towards connecting larger units, a recent study (Schauer, 2000) examined the interaction of discourse structure and referential relations among nominal expressions. 4.1 Structural Dependencies What seems intuitively clear, is that a theory of discourse structure should reflect the structure of the text under consideration. Rhetorical Structure Theory, however, concentrates on the effects intended by the author of a text.

Basically, the algorithm uses the successful resolution of anaphoric expressions as a guideline for determining the target unit to which a new unit should be connected which in turn restricts the set of units which should be searched for resolving further referring expressions. The algorithm assumes the availability of several capabilities for anaphora resolution. First, for a given unit candidates a set of noun phrases needs to be identified that may be anaphoric expressions.

So, the new right frontier consists of the newly attached unit, the 9The computed representation of the discourse structure is shown in Figure 6, while the storage of accessible referential objects is managed elsewhere in the system as it interacts with the syntactic parser. modified node and its predecessors. The evaluation in (Schauer, 2000) showed that the predictions made by the algorithm depend crucially on the size of the elementary units considered. When clauses are considered to be the elementary unit size, the predictions are correct in up to 81% of the cases in which the algorithm makes a prediction — under the pre-condition that intra-sentential units are handled first. Linking units by referential makes surely no sense when the units considered are phrases: of course, syntactic constraints always mandate that intra-clausal units are related with each other first.

The degree expression SPACE, with its associated negative POL-MARKER, (Staab and Hahn, 1997) is the trigger for recognizing the evaluative status of the matrix clause. We can now start looking for the signalled Explanation for this negative judgment. Explanation can be found quite easily: usually, a MOTHERBOARD has up to four PCISLOTS (see the default value that is denoted at the PART-OF relation in Figure 1). But actually the situation HAS-PART-STATE is a state in which only one is present, which is obviously &amp;quot;little&amp;quot;.

Cursorily viewed, the claims of another recent study stand in contrast to the idea of intra-clausal discourse units: (Schauer, 2000) examined the interplay of coreferential expressions and discourse structure and concluded that referential relations are a good indicator of the discourse structural configurations in case the units examined are en</context>

Asher does not rely on coreferences for establishing target units; instead the derivation of a coherence relation (and thereby of the target unit to connect a new unit to) relies on rather abstract connections between &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;. While recognizing coreference relations certainly also requires domain knowledge and inference capabilities, recognizing connections between events seems an even more impossible task. The presented approach is hence more light-weight in nature. (Webber et al., 1999) apply operations on trees for incorporating cue-phrases in a grammar-driven approach to discourse structure. The presented algorithm could be integrated with their approach, to account for the cases of units that are not connected by referential relations but via cue-phrases. 7 Conclusion Starting from the question what are the elementary units to consider for a text&apos;s discourse structure, I presented an account for prepositional phrases with adjunct-status as discourse units. Prepositions can be seen as a kind of cue-phrase; however, a preposition does not necessarily signal a coherence rela</context>

For computing a semantic interpretation6 , the corresponding conceptual correlates of the content words are then checked 5We assume the framework of description logics (Woods and Schmolze, 1992). for role compatibility. In Example (1-b), the major interpretation constraints derive from the main verb &amp;quot;bietet&amp;quot; (provide) which is represented by the concept PROVIDE. It has three major conceptual roles, PROVIDE-PATIENT, PROVIDE-COPATIENT, and INSTRUMENT. The PROVIDEPATIENT and PROVIDE-CO-PATIENT roles can be filled by some instance of MOTHERBOARD and SPACE, respectively. Focusing on the analysis of the PP, each preposition specifies allowed semantic relations (Romacker et al., 1999).
