1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998124538461538">
In the past, quite a few phenomena related to discourse structures have been studied, such as lexical
cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), coherence relation (Hobbs, 1985; Wu and Lytinen, 1989), and
rhetorical relation (Mann and Thompson, 1988). On the other hand, there also exists abundant
research on communicative intention such as speech act theory (Searle, 1968) and relevance maxim
(Wilson and Sperber, 1986). One logical question to ask is then:
What is the relationship between discourse structures and communicative intention?
In the following, we shall take an objective approach to bridging the gap between these two SPIS of
phenomena. More specifically, certain discourse structures and communicative intentions are taken.
as literally as possible, from their &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; theories; Then, without any predefined framework, we
observe the emergence of an integral discourse model encompassing these structures and intentions
via necessary &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; knowledge and inferences. Thus, on the one hand, our integrative views
toward discourse structures and intentions are similar to (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and ( Moore and
Pollack, 1992) in the sense that we hold
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9989615">
• The separation of attentional and intentional &amp;quot;tracks&amp;quot; of discourse&apos;.
• The stratification of coherence (informational) and rhetorical (intentional) relations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976104538461539">
On the other hand, unlike previous work, we formulate knowledge sources which explair, bow the
emergence of integrated discourse model is possible, rather than just identifying such integration.
In particular, the following knowledge sources are identified:
KN-LC which associate concepts denoted by words (anchoring Lexical Cohesion)
KN-SA which interpret utterances in terms of the speaker&apos;s mental models which consist of propo-
sitions embedded in attitude contexts (anchoring Speech Acts)
KN-CR which specify a domain theory of physical world (anchoring Coherence Relations)
KN-RR which specify a domain theory of mental dynamics (anchoring Rhetorical Relations)
The above four knowledge sources in turns are governed by the ultimate principles of Relevance
Maxim (KN-RM). In short, by explicating the knowledge behind discourse structures and intentions.
we advocate that the stratification of discourse structures and intentions is motivated/supporte(l
by modularized, but related, knowledge sources.
&apos;This, however, will not he discussed here; interested readers are referred to (Wu, 1)93) for some d discussion.

In the following, we propose a sequence of specific questions concerning lexical cohesions ( IA &apos;).
coherence relations (CR), rhetorical relations (RR), speech acts (SA), and conversational maxims
(CM); more specifically, we intend to demonstrate the following strata
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999525">
• X coherence relation encompasses Y lexical cohesion (CR &gt; LC).
• X rhetorical relation encompasses Y coherence relation (RR &gt; CR).
• X speech act is achieved by Y rhetorical relation (SA &gt; RR).
• X relevance maxim is obeyed by Y speech act (RM &gt; SA).

Let&apos;s look at an example which is composed for an independent purpose; It is taken from (M;1.1111
and Thompson, 1986):
(Si) I love to collect classic automobiles.
(S2) My favorite car is my 1887 Duryea.
First, let&apos;s observe that the semantic/propositional interpretation of Si and 52 yields 1.11c 1O1
lowing (main) propositions:
LOVE(1, { al OLD(a) &amp; AUTOMOBILE(a) })
FAVOR.ITE(I, b), CAR(b), b = 1887-Duryea
That is, I love antique automobiles and my favorite car is the 1887 Duryea. fly detecting the
following lexical cohesions (between the words denoting the concepts):
KN-LC-1:
&apos;CAR&apos; is a synonym of &apos;AUTOMOBILE&apos;
&apos;FAVORITE&apos; is similar to &apos;LOVE&apos;
We conclude the following coherence relation,
Exemplification(S2, Si) — (F1)
since as (Hobbs, 1985) defines it, we can
KN-CR-1:
Infer p(A) from Si and p(a) from 52, where a is a member or subset of A
in our case, &apos;p&apos; is &apos;LOVE&apos; (cm &apos;FAVORITE&apos;) and &apos;A&apos; is the set of automobiles and &apos;a&apos; is the car ( ny
1887 Duryea).
Now, we have demonstrated the connection between coherence relations and lexical cohesions.
Let&apos;s look at how this is connected to rhetorical relations and speech acts. First, we need to extend
the interpretation of Si and S2 from purely propositional to including propositional attitudes ( ( U.
(Cohen and Levesque, 1990), (Wu and Lytinen, 1991) and (Wu and Lytinen, 1992)),
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.634495666666667">
KN-SA-1:
Si = BEL(Spkr, LOVE(Spkr, { al OLD(a) &amp; AUTOMOBILE(a) })) (102)
S2 = BEL(Spkr, (FAVORITE(Spkr, b), CAR(b), h = 1887-Duryea))
</equation>
<page confidence="0.986845">
153
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9342675">
That is, the speaker (spkr) &apos;believes,&apos; as well as &apos;stated,&apos; that Si and S2. In order to conceive the
intention behind the speaker&apos;s making S2, it is reasonable to assume that
MBEL(Hr, Spkr, ?BEL(Hr, LOVE(Spkr, a I OLD(a) &amp; AUTOMOBILE(a) }))) — (F3)
That is, the speaker and the hearer (Hr) mutually believe (MBEL) that the hearer weakly believes
(?BEL) Si. Thus, in order to facilitate the &amp;quot;acceptance&amp;quot; of Si, the speaker uses S2 as an &apos;evidence&apos;
to support Si. That is, the following speech act and rhetorical relation are achieved simultaneously,
ASSERT(Spkr, Si) and Evidence(S2, Si)
The Evidence rhetorical relation is achieved through associating the following knowledge concerning
persuasiveness and the Exemplification coherence relation (an instance of which is recognized in
F1):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.496278">
(KN-RR-1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991151066666667">
IF the speaker provides more detailed information about a fact P (such as stating an
example of P)
THEN the hearer is more obliged to believe P (because the speaker really wants him to
believe P)
Once the Evidence rhetorical relation is recognized, the hearer recognizes that the speaker really
wants him to believe P from the THEN-part of KN-RR-1:
WANT(Spkr, Hr, BEL(Hr, LOVE(Spkr, 1 a I OLD(a) &amp; AUTOMOBILE(a) }))) (F4)
Based on F2, F3 and F4, the hearer has recognized, according to Searle, the sincerity, the prepara-
tory, and the essential conditions of the Assertion speech act, respectively. Together with the
Evidence rhetorical relation, it is clear that the speaker is making an assertion.
Now, the last question remains as which relevance maxim has been obeyed during the above
process. According to (Sperber and Wilson, 1986), relevance is obeyed by producing the following
contextual effects (KN-RMs) (1) enhancing a statement (2) canceling a statement (3) introducing a.
statement. Thus, in S2, the speaker has addressed the relevance by producing a definite contextual
effects to enhance the certainty of a proposition.

3 Discussion and conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722333333333">
In summary, we have demonstrated through tracing detailed examples that an integrated model of
discourse does encompass discourse structures and intentions. We also take an objective approach
in arguing so, since we do not predefine any framework to demonstrate our thesis; Rather. we
follow existing theories and by identifying the necessary bridging knowledge and inferences, we
just observe the integration emerging out of the individual discourse structures and intentions as
defined in their native theories.
This integrative view is similar to others, e.g., (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and (Moore and Pollack.
1992). Due to the lack of space, we did not deal with the full ranges of issues, but many of our
positions are identical to others, in particular:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.59431">
1. Discourse structure and intention form a strata
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.996082">

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.978382666666667">
2. Many to many mapping exists between adjacent layers of the strata, e.g., between colierpnro
and rhetorical relations for both text generation and interpretation
3. The nucleus and satellite, if exist, may not coincide between two adjacent layers.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99355075">
What we have demonstrated in this paper is a particular (one-to-one) instance of a strata of
discourse structure and intention. To be more specific, we demonstrate how a lexical cohesion gives
rise to coherence relation; a coherence relation to a rhetorical relation; then to a speech act and a.
relevance maxim. In doing so, we feel we have extended the research in the following ways
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9914195">
• Address a wider range of strata; not only between coherence and rhetorical relations, but all
the way from lexical cohesions till relevance maxims;
• Formulate knowledge which explain the emergence of such connections between layers of
discourse
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999815">
The second point has been kept in the background in many previous research. For example, now
it can be readily understood that an Exemplification coherence relation can give rise to an Evi-
dence rhetorical relation. However, knowledge such as (KN-RR-1) is kept implicit; but upon closer
inspection, it becomes obvious without such knowledge the connection between Exemplification
and Evidence can not be established. Thus, flushing out the explanatory theory for the mapping
between discourse strata has been identified as our most urgent research topic. In particular. the
knowledge in the maxim level (KN-RM) is much in need of further study, especially with respect
to other layers of the strata.
