We quantify the lexical subjectivity of ad-
jectives using a corpus-based method, and
show for the first time that it correlates
with noun concreteness in large corpora.
These cognitive dimensions together influ-
ence how word meanings combine, and
we exploit this fact to achieve performance
improvements on the semantic classifica-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999966101449276">
Concreteness, the degree to which language has
a perceptible physical referent, and subjectivity,
the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on
the perspective of the speaker, are well established
cognitive and linguistic notions. Recent results
suggest that they could also be useful knowledge
for natural language processing systems that aim
to extract and represent the meaning of language.
Insight into concreteness can help systems to
classify adjective-noun pairs according to their se-
mantics. In the non-literal expressions kill the pro-
cess or black comedy, a verb or adjective that oc-
curs with a concrete argument in literal phrases
takes an abstract argument. Turney et al. (2011)
present a supervised model that exploits this effect
to correctly classify 79% of adjective-noun pairs
as having literal or non-literal meaning.
Subjectivity analysis has already proved highly
applicable to a range of NLP applications, includ-
ing sentiment analysis, information extraction and
text categorization (Pang and Lee, 2004; Riloff
and Wiebe, 2003). For such applications, subjec-
tivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level.
However, recent work has highlighted the applica-
tion of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics,
for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words
according to their usage or sense (Wiebe and Mi-
halcea, 2006; Banea et al., 2014).
The importance of concreteness to NLP systems
is likely to grow with the emergence of multi-
modal semantic models (Bruni et al., 2012; Roller
and Schulte im Walde, 2013). Such models, which
learn representations from both linguistic and per-
ceptual input, outperform text-only models on a
range of evaluations. However, while multi-modal
models acquire richer representations of concrete
concepts, their ability to represent abstract con-
cepts can be weaker than text-only models (Hill et
al., 2013). A principled treatment of concreteness
is thus likely to be important if the multi-modal
approach is to prove effective on a wider range of
concepts. In a similar vein, interest in subjectiv-
ity analysis is set to grow with interest in extract-
ing sentiment and opinion from the web and social
media (Benson et al., 2011). Moreover, given that
humans seem to exploit both concreteness (Paivio,
1990) and subjectivity (Canestrelli et al., 2013)
clues when processing language, it is likely that
the same clues should benefit computational mod-
els aiming to replicate human-level performance
in this area.
In this paper, we show how concreteness and
subjectivity can be applied together to produce
performance improvements on two classification
problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal
adjective-noun pairs (Turney et al., 2011), and
classifying the modification type exhibited by
such pairs (Boleda et al., 2012). We describe an
unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify ad-
jective subjectivity, and show that it effectively
predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity
lexicon. Further, we show for the first time that
adjective subjectivity correlates with noun con-
creteness in large corpora. In addition, we anal-
yse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective
subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating
how the interaction of these dimensions enables
the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs
according to their semantics. We conclude by dis-

Concreteness A large and growing body of em-
pirical evidence indicates clear differences be-
tween concrete concepts, such as donut or hot-
dog and abstract concepts, such as guilt or obesity.
Concrete words are more easily learned, remem-
bered and processed than abstract words (Paivio,
1991), while differences in brain activity (Binder
et al., 2005) and cognitive representation (Hill et
al., 2013) have also been observed. In linguistic
conctructions, concreteness appears to influence
compound and phrasal semantics (Traugott, 1985;
Bowdle and Gentner, 2005; Turney et al., 2011).
Together with the practical applications outlined in
Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value
of concreteness for models aiming to replicate hu-
man performance in language processing tasks.
While automatic methods have been proposed
for the quantification of lexical concreteness, they
each rely on dictionaries or similar hand-coded
resources (Kwong, 2008; Turney et al., 2011).
We instead extract scores from a recently released
dataset of lexical concepts rated on a 1-5 scale for
concreteness by 20 annotators in a crowdsourcing
experiment (Brysbaert et al., 2013).1
Subjectivity Subjectivity is the degree to which
language is interpretable independently of the
speaker’s perspective (Langacker, 2002). For ex-
ample, the utterance he sits across the table is
more subjective than he sits opposite Sam as its
truth depends on the speaker’s position. Language
may also be subjective because it conveys evalua-
tions or opinions (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
Computational applications of subjectivity, in-
cluding sentiment analysis and information ex-
traction, have focused largely on phrase or doc-
ument meaning.2 In contrast, here we present six
corpus-based features designed to quantify the lex-
ical subjectivity of adjectives. The features Com-
parability and Modifiability are identified as pre-
dictors of subjectivity by Wiebe (2000). The re-
mainder are motivated by corpus studies and/or
observations from the theoretical literature.3

to the task of ordering multiple-modifier strings.

<note confidence="0.56616">
Adverbiability: Quirk et al. (1985) theorizes that
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9394918">
subjective adjectives tend to develop derived ad-
verbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives
do not. We thus define adverbiability as the fre-
quency of derived adverbial forms relative to the
frequency of their base form, e.g.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.984775">
E hotly
E hot + E hotly
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999795571428572">
Comparability: Wiebe (2000) oberve that grad-
able are more likely to be subjective. Following
Wiebe, we note that the existence of comparative
forms for an adjective are indicative of gradabil-
ity. We thus define comparability as the frequency
of comparative or superlative forms relative to the
frequency of the base form, e.g.

<equation confidence="0.995535">
E hotter + E hottest
E hot + E hotter + E hottest
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906275862069">
LeftTendency: Adamson (2000) proposes that
more subjective adjectives typically occur furthest
from the noun in multiple-modifier strings such as
(hot crossed buns). We consequently extract the
LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the fre-
quency of occurrence as the leftmost of two ad-
jectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of
occurrence in multiple-modifier strings.
Modifiability: Another characteristic of gradable
adjectives noted by Wiebe (2000) is that they ad-
mit degree modifiers (very/quite delicious). We
therefore extract the relative frequency of occur-
rence with one of a hand-coded list of English de-
gree modifiers.
Predicativity: Bolinger (1967) proposed that sub-
jective adjectives occur in predicative construc-
tions (the cake is sweet), rather than attribu-
tive constructions (the German capital) more fre-
quently than objective adjectives. We therefore ex-
tract the relative frequency of occurrence in such
constructions.
Non-nominality: Many adjectives also function
as nouns (sweet cake vs. (boiled sweet). Un-
like nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjec-
tive, and the number of adjectives in texts corre-
lates with human judgements of their subjectivity
(Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). We there-
fore extract the frequency with which concepts are
tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the

assumption that ‘pure’ adjectives are on average
more subjective than nominal-style adjectives.
Concreteness meets Subjectivity Demonstra-
ble commonalities in how different people per-
ceive the physical world suggest that concrete lan-
guage may be more objective than abstract lan-
guage (Langacker, 1997). Intuitively, adjectives
ascribing physical properties (wooden shed) are
more objective than those conveying abstract traits
(suspicious man). Indeed, in certain cases the
original, apparently objective, senses of polyse-
mous adjectives are not modifiable (very wooden
shed?), while their more abstract sense extensions
are (very wooden personality).
Motivated by these observations, in the follow-
ing sections we test two hypotheses. (1) Subjec-
tive / objective adjectives are more likely to mod-
ify abstract / concrete nouns respectively. (2) Sub-
jectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of
how adjective and noun concepts combine.

To verify the quality of our subjectivity features,
we measured their performance as predictors in a
logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives
labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al.
(2005) lexicon.4 The combination of all features
produced an overall classifiction accuracy of 79%.

tors in isolation is shown in Figure 1 (top).
We first tested the relationship between con-

pothesized, CONC(n) was a significant predictor
of the magnitude of the subjectivity profile (Pear-

To explore the relationship between concrete-

in the CONC-SUBJ semantic space (Figure 2,

tom) illustrates the the CONC-ExpCONC space.
In both spaces, the extremities reflect particular
meaning combination types. Pairs in the bottom-
left region of the CONC-SUBJ space (objective
adjectives with abstract nouns, such as green pol-
itics) seem to exhibit a non-literal, or at least non
prototypical modification type. In contrast, for
pairs in the objective+concrete corner, the adjec-
tives appear to perform a classifying or categoriz-
ing function (baptist minister).
In the CONC-ExpCONC space, on the diag-
onal, where noun-concreteness is ‘as expected’,
pairings appear to combine literally. Away from
the diagonal, meaning composition is less pre-
dictable. In the top-left, where ExpCONC is
greater than CONC, the combinations are almost
all non-literal, as shown in Table 2.
In this section we have outlined a set of corpus
features that, taken together, enable effective ap-
proximation of adjective subjectivity. The results
of our analyses also demonstrate a clear interac-
tion between subjectivity and concreteness scores
for nouns attributed by human raters. Specifi-
cally, objective adjectives are more likely to mod-
ify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are
more likely to modify abstract nouns. Qualita-
tive investigations further suggest the interaction
between these dimensions to be useful in the se-
mantic characterization of adjective-noun pairs, a
proposition we test formally in the next section.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999729085714286">
Models were trained with concreteness features
(CONC and ExpCONC), subjectivity features
(SUBJ and SUBJpfl) and the combination of both
types (Combined). The performance of each
model is presented in Table 3, along with a base-
line score reflecting the strategy of allocating all
pairs to the largest class.
On the non-literal composition task, the con-
creteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models out-
perform that of Turney et al. (79.0). The concrete-
ness model performance represents further confir-
mation of the link between concreteness and com-
position. The improvement of this model over
Turney et al. (2011) is perhaps to be expected,
since our model exploits the wide scope of the
new Brysbaert et al. (2013) crowdsourced data
whereas Turney et al. infer concreteness scores
from a smaller training set. Notably, our combined
model improves on the concreteness-only model,
confirming that the interaction of concreteness and
subjectivity provides additional information perti-
nent to meaning composition.
The modification-type task has no performance
benchmark since Boleda et al. (2012) do not use
their data for classification. Although all models
improve on the majority-class baseline, the com-
bined model was again most effective. Additive
improvement over the baseline in each case was
lower than for the composition task, which may
reflect the greater subtlety inherent in the sub-
sective/intersective classification. Indeed, inter-
annotator agreement for this goldstandard (Co-
hen’s κ = 0.87) was lower than for the composi-
tion task (0.95), implying a less cognitively salient
distinction.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989108695652">
We have shown that objective adjectives are most
likely to modify concrete nouns, and that non-
literal combinations can emerge when this princi-
ple is violated (Section 3). Indeed, the occurrence
of an adjective with a more abstract noun than
those it typically modifies is a strikingly consistent
indicator of metaphoricity (Table 2). In addition,
we showed that both concreteness and subjectivity
improve the automatic classification of adjective-
noun pairs according to compositionality or mod-
ification type (Section 4). Importantly, a classifier
with both subjectivity and concreteness features
outperforms concreteness-only classifiers, includ-
ing those proposed in previous work.
The results underline the relevance of both sub-
jectivity and concreteness to lexical and phrasal
semantics, and their application to language pro-
cessing tasks. We hypothesize that concreteness
and subjectivity are fundamental to human lan-
guage processing because language is precisely
the conveyance of information about the world
from one party to another. In decoding this sig-
nal, it is clearly informative to understand to what
extent the information refers directly to the world,
and also to what extent it reports a fact versus an
opinion. We believe these dimensions will ulti-
mately prove essential for computational systems
aiming to replicate human performance in inter-
preting language. As the results suggest, they may
be particularly important for capturing the intrica-
cies of semantic composition and thus extending
representations beyond the lexeme.
Of course, two dimensions alone are not suf-
ficient to reflect all of the subtleties of adjective
and noun semantics. For instance, our model clas-
sifies white spirit, a transparent cleaning product,
as non-literal, since the lexical concreteness score
does not allow for strong noun polysemy. Further,
it makes no allowance for wider sentential context,
which can be an important clue to modification
type in such cases.
We aim to address these limitations in future
work by integrating subjectivity and concreteness
with conventially acquired semantic representa-
tions, and, ultimately, models that integrate input
corresponding to the perceptual modalities.

Subjectivity analysis has already proved highly applicable to a range of NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, information extraction and text categorization (Pang and Lee, 2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). For such applications, subjectivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level. However, recent work has highlighted the application of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics, for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words according to their usage or sense (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Banea et al., 2014). The importance of concreteness to NLP systems is likely to grow with the emergence of multimodal semantic models (Bruni et al., 2012; Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013). Such models, which learn representations from both linguistic and perceptual input, outperform text-only models on a range of evaluations. However, while multi-modal models acquire richer representations of concrete concepts, their ability to represent abstract concepts can be weaker than text-only models (Hill et al., 2013).

In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs (Turney et al., 2011), and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs (Boleda et al., 2012). We describe an unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify adjective subjectivity, and show that it effectively predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity lexicon. Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora. In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics.

(2011) developed a list of 100 common adjective-noun pairs classified as either denotative (used literally) or connotative (non-literal) by five annotators. Using an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al. (logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification. 4.2 Modification-type Classification Boleda et al. (2012) introduce a set of 370 adjective-noun pairs grouped into modification types by human judges. Because a red car is both a car and red, the pair is classed as intersective, whereas dark humour, which is not literally dark, is classed as subsective. To create a distinct but analogous binary categorization problem to the composition task, we filtered out pairs not unanimously allocated to either class.

Although all models improve on the majority-class baseline, the combined model was again most effective. Additive improvement over the baseline in each case was lower than for the composition task, which may reflect the greater subtlety inherent in the subsective/intersective classification. Indeed, interannotator agreement for this goldstandard (Cohen’s κ = 0.87) was lower than for the composition task (0.95), implying a less cognitively salient distinction. 5 Conclusion We have shown that objective adjectives are most likely to modify concrete nouns</context>

We instead extract scores from a recently released dataset of lexical concepts rated on a 1-5 scale for concreteness by 20 annotators in a crowdsourcing experiment (Brysbaert et al., 2013).1 Subjectivity Subjectivity is the degree to which language is interpretable independently of the speaker’s perspective (Langacker, 2002). For example, the utterance he sits across the table is more subjective than he sits opposite Sam as its truth depends on the speaker’s position. Language may also be subjective because it conveys evaluations or opinions (Mihalcea et al., 2007). Computational applications of subjectivity, including sentiment analysis and information extraction, have focused largely on phrase or document meaning.2 In contrast, here we present six corpus-based features design</context>

Indeed, in certain cases the original, apparently objective, senses of polysemous adjectives are not modifiable (very wooden shed?), while their more abstract sense extensions are (very wooden personality). Motivated by these observations, in the following sections we test two hypotheses. (1) Subjective / objective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract / concrete nouns respectively. (2) Subjectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine. 3 Analysis In addressing (1), we extracted the 2,000 highestfrequency nouns from the Brysbaert et al. (2013) concreteness dataset. We denote by CONC(n) the mean concreteness rating for noun n. For the 24,908 adjectives that occur in some adjectivenoun pair with one of these nouns in the British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech et al., 1994), we extracted subjectivity features from the Google Books Corpus (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013). Since each of the six features takes values on [0, 1], we define the overall subjectivity of an adjective a with feature vector sa = [sa 1 ... sa6] as NonNominality LeftTendency Comparability Predicativity Modifiability Adverbiability Combined 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 −0.1 24 6 C</context>

The performance of each model is presented in Table 3, along with a baseline score reflecting the strategy of allocating all pairs to the largest class. On the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al. (79.0). The concreteness model performance represents further confirmation of the link between concreteness and composition. The improvement of this model over Turney et al.

In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs (Turney et al., 2011), and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs (Boleda et al., 2012).

Predicativity: Bolinger (1967) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions (the cake is sweet), rather than attributive constructions (the German capital) more frequently than objective adjectives. We therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions. Non-nominality: Many adjectives also function as nouns (sweet cake vs. (boiled sweet). Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). We therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the 726 assumption that ‘pure’ adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives.

Recent results suggest that they could also be useful knowledge for natural language processing systems that aim to extract and represent the meaning of language. Insight into concreteness can help systems to classify adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics. In the non-literal expressions kill the process or black comedy, a verb or adjective that occurs with a concrete argument in literal phrases takes an abstract argument. Turney et al. (2011) present a supervised model that exploits this effect to correctly classify 79% of adjective-noun pairs as having literal or non-literal meaning. Subjectivity analysis has already proved highly applicable to a range of NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, information extraction and text categorization (Pang and Lee, 2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). For such applications, subjectivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level.

Moreover, given that humans seem to exploit both concreteness (Paivio, 1990) and subjectivity (Canestrelli et al., 2013) clues when processing language, it is likely that the same clues should benefit computational models aiming to replicate human-level performance in this area. In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs (Turney et al., 2011), and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs (Boleda et al., 2012). We describe an unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify adjective subjectivity, and show that it effectively predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity lexicon. Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora. In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs accord</context>

Figure 2: Adjective-noun pairs in two semantic spaces. Selected pairs are labelled for illustration, italics indicate non-literal meaning combinations. 4.1 Non-literal Composition Task To evaluate their model of lexical concreteness, Turney et al. (2011) developed a list of 100 common adjective-noun pairs classified as either denotative (used literally) or connotative (non-literal) by five annotators. Using an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al. (logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification. 4.2 Modification-type Classification Boleda et al.

The performance of each model is presented in Table 3, along with a baseline score reflecting the strategy of allocating all pairs to the largest class. On the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al. (79.0). The concreteness model performance represents further confirmation of the link between concreteness and composition. The improvement of this model over Turney et al. (2011) is perhaps to be expected, since our model exploits the wide scope of the new Brysbaert et al. (2013) crowdsourced data whereas Turney et al. infer concreteness scores from a smaller training set. Notably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition. The modification-type task has no performance benchmark since Boleda et al. (2012) do not use their data for classification.

The importance of concreteness to NLP systems is likely to grow with the emergence of multimodal semantic models (Bruni et al., 2012; Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013). Such models, which learn representations from both linguistic and perceptual input, outperform text-only models on a range of evaluations. However, while multi-modal models acquire richer representations of concrete concepts, their ability to represent abstract concepts can be weaker than text-only models (Hill et al., 2013).

We consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the frequency of occurrence as the leftmost of two adjectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings. Modifiability: Another characteristic of gradable adjectives noted by Wiebe (2000) is that they admit degree modifiers (very/quite delicious). We therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence with one of a hand-coded list of English degree modifiers. Predicativity: Bolinger (1967) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions (the cake is sweet), rather than attributive constructions (the German capital) more frequently than objective adjectives. We therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions. Non-nominality: Many adjectives also function as nouns (sweet cake vs. (boiled sweet).
