In this paper we discuss some
philosophical questions related to the
treatment of abstract and underspecified
prepositions. We consider three issues in
particular: (i) the relation between sense
and meanings, (ii) the privileged status of
abstract meanings in the spectrum of
contextual instantiations of basic senses,
and finally (iii) the difference between
prediction and inference. The discussion
will be based on the study of avec (with)
and the analysis of its abstract meaning of
comitativity in particular. A model for
avec semantic variability will also be
suggested.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999196">
Through the study of the preposition avec we
discuss some major questions related to the
analysis and model of abstract prepositions.
Avec is traditionally (Spang-Hanssen, 1963)
considered as a mixed preposition. On one side,
its contextual behavior is very heterogeneous:
contrary to the colored prepositions (e.g.
spatial), it seems difficult to construct a unique
sense from which all the meanings are derived;
nevertheless, contrary to the uncolored
prepositions such as de (of) or à (to) in French,
avec seems to point to an identifiable set of
constraints. It is our aim to investigate whether
this set exists and to determine its status. This
requires an answer to the following questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999097285714286">
1. How can the contextual variability of
polysemous prepositions be mastered ?
2. Does a privileged sense exists in the
spectrum of this variability ?
3. What is the relation between sense and
meanings ?
4. What criteria have to be filled by a model ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999491035714286">
We discuss the first of these questions in
section 2 where we present the theoretical
contention around the notion of polysemy of
grammatical items and prepositions in
particular, against which we will have to
evaluate the results of our study. The second
question will be illustrated in section 3 where
we present the main meanings of avec and focus
on comitativity, which, being more abstract then
the others, seems to point directly to the under-
specified set of constraints defining avec in
general. In section 4 we briefly introduce a
model inspired from Channel Theory (Barwise
and Seligman, 1997) and we test it on the
problematic data related to the meaning of
comitativity. In section 5 we come back to the
two remaining questions: we present a model for
the whole semantic domain of avec by
introducing the distinction among notions and
values and discuss the inferential power of our
model.
Following Pinkal&apos;s distinction between
sense and meaning (Pinkal, 1985, Poesio, 1996),
we consider that senses tell us under which
circumstances in the world the sentence is true
or false, and that meanings assigned to an
expression behaves as functions from contexts
to senses.

2 Polysemy and contextual variability
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945308226415094">
The notion of polysemy implies that (i) a word
has many different meanings and that (ii) these
meanings are in a certain way related to one
another. A major issue is then to explain the
phrase &amp;quot;in a certain way&amp;quot;. By virtue of what
principles are they related? Is it by virtue of a
unique sense that, together with a rule system
allows to generate all of them, or simply by
virtue of family resemblances ?
More fundamentally, the notion of
polysemy poses the major question of the
relation between language and thought. It is not
only a matter of discovering whether a unique
sense exists, but also to determine whether this
sense is cognitively grounded, or in other terms,
whether it is pre-linguistic or perception based.
Cognitive linguists such as Wierzbicka
(1996) claim that all meanings are derived from
a cognitive primitive-based dictionary by a
cognitive grammar. Under her account, language
is grounded in thought and polysemy is a
consequence of the instantiation of thought into
language, the cognitive dictionary being the glue
of all the meanings of a polysemous word.
Wittgenstein (1953/1961) introduces in his
Philosophical Investigations (§68) a radically
different point of view. He argues that it is
clearly impossible to define words by abstract
meanings on the account of pure observation.
Provocative, this affirmation poses the problem
of the existence of rules and opens a series of
other questions: do definitions of polysemous
word exist? And what do these definitions look
like? Is it possible for an abstract definition to
coexist with local values not caught by this
definition? What is their status then?
According to these antithetic philosophical
positions, prepositions have undergone different
treatments. Jackendoff (1987), Wierzbicka
(1996) and Brøndal (1950) consider that they
instantiate primitive atomic notions and that
their meanings can be metaphorically and
metonymically calculated; some other authors
such as Cadiot (1997) consider instead that
prepositions denote different properties on a
variable spectrum that cannot be reduced to an
atomic sense.
These positions are more often grounded in
philosophical considerations rather than in
empirical observations. Our approach is
fundamentally inductive and is focused on the
meaning of comitativity which seems to trace a
privileged way to the abstract notion of avec.

The meaning of comitativity, as argued by
Cadiot (1997), stays in the middle of the
spectrum of the semantic domain of the
preposition avec: it is less constrained than the
meaning of reciprocity and more specific than
the meaning thematic. Compared to
instrumental and manner, it is characterized by a
notion of symmetry as will be discussed at
length in the next section. Its privileged status
clearly emerges from the definition given for the
first time by Guillaume (1919/1975) and
adopted by Cadiot (ibid.) in a recent study.
Guillaume (ibid.: 279) defines the comitativity
as follows1: “ the preposition avec is an abstract
image of parallelism: it expresses the relation
holding between two entities that exist or act
together, accomplish the same movements and
follow the same directions. This image
presupposes a certain equality ... which is easily
realized when the preposition links two nouns”.
Cadiot (ibid.: 153) adds to this the notion of
interaction: “avec creates ... the conditions for
an optimal interaction between two entities of
the reality”.
It is important to note that these definitions
also apply to avec in general: according to these
authors, they fit the meaning of comitativity and
are modified into the other contextual
possibilities enumerated in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
Three key notions emerge as fundamental
from these citations: parallelism, interaction and
finally association, which is strictly related to the
first two. In the following section we show that the
intuition grounding these definitions is correct, but
that it is precisely the sense of association that
needs an explanation: to define avec means to
clearly formulate the constraints which need to be
satisfied for two or more entities to be said
&amp;quot;associated&amp;quot;. We admit that the meaning of
comitativity has a privileged status and focus on it.

3.1 Cadiot&apos;s account of comitativity
and problematic data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955781">
On a phenomenological level, Cadiot (1997)
analyzes the typical example of comitativity in
(1), by a condition on symmetry (2) which
implies a coordination (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992340428571429">
(1) Pierre marche avec Marie / Peter walks with
Mary
(2) a. If NP1 VP avec NP2 then, NP2 VP avec

“Marie marche avec Pierre”

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99653575">
b. If “Pierre marche avec Marie”, then
“Pierre marche” and “Marie marche”
These conditions properly describe the fact
that in a situation where &amp;quot;Pierre walks with
Mary&amp;quot; it is true that &amp;quot;Pierre walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marie
walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pierre walks and Marie walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marie
walks with Pierre&amp;quot;.
Nevertheless, these conditions appear too
vague: all the cases enumerated from (4) to (6)
below are unproperly generated by (2) and (3).
Consider the case of two animates who are
both at the same time in the same place2.

is no interaction between them. The spatio-
temporal association which seems sufficient for
interpreting (4a) has to be reinforced by a
stronger sense of interaction for (4b) to be
interpretable.
The condition in (2) also misses the
difference between (5a) and (5b). Consider two
inanimate entities:
(5) a. Les verres sont dans le buffet avec les
carafes / The glasses are in the cabinet with the
pitchers
b. (??)La porte est dans le salon avec la
fenêtre / The door is in the living-room with the
window
The sentence (5b) cannot describe the
relation existing between a window and a door
of a living-room. For it to be interpretable, the
door and the window have to be figured out as
taken down.
Finally, the condition in (2) misses the
constraints related to the nature of the
predicates:
(6) a. Jean est gentil avec Marie / John is kind
with Mary
b. (??)Jean est triste avec Marie / John is sad
with Mary
The only possibility to interpret (6b) is that
Mary has an influence on John’s sadness. The
interpretation that John is sad, Mary is sad and
that they are sad together at the same time, as
foreseen by (2), is excluded.
Of course these are all problematic data that
a model of avec must explain. More abstractly,
two major difficulties missed by (2) will have to
be solved:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9647826">
(i) The spatio-temporal association
problem. As discussed above (cf. (4a) / (4b)) the
property of spatio-temporal location is not
always sufficient to ensure the association of
two entities.
(ii) Regular association vs. accidental
association. Consider two persons walking form
point X to point Y. (7a) and (7b) describe this
scene in a fundamentally different way:
(7) a. Le passant A marche avec le passant B /
Person A walks with person B
b. Le passant A et le passant B marchent /
Person A and person B walk

accidental. If one of the two persons turns
around a corner, the other will do the same. This
set of inferences is not enhanced by (7b), where
et presents the coordination of the walks of the
two persons as purely accidental.
In the rest of the paper we will refer to (7a)
as showing a togetherness effect. In the
following section we introduce an intensional
model which takes the mechanism of this effect
into account.

The model we are about to present is an
intentional model that takes into account the
properties of the entities denoted by the NPs of
the construction NP1 VP avec[+comitativity] NP2.
This explanation contrasts with the extensional
models that have been used to explain the
togetherness effect (Lasersohn, 1998).
Our representation serves the purpose of
illustrating, by a concrete case, the speculative
discussion in the next section. It can be
questioned on many different formal aspects,
and can be further elaborated or even differently
expressed. Nevertheless the model is intuitive
enough to ground the philosophical discussion
underlying our case study.

4.1 Shortcomings of extensional
models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946783125">
Lasershon (ibid.) proposes a model of
togetherness based on the notion of group:
(8) Together: given the eventuality3 e, a
property P and a group g, together is appropriate
iff g ∈ P(e) and, for each part (proper or
improper) e’ of e, if it exists x such that x ∈
P(e’), then P(e’) = P(e).
Under this account, a group is thought of in
terms of the minimal number of entities sharing
a property in an event (or state) and all its parts.
As such, this model fails to discard the cases of
pure accidental association such as (7b): this
notion of group can be applied to a scene where
two (and only two) persons accidentally walk in
the street from point A to point B and in all the
parts (proper and improper) of this path.

4.2 Channel theory and intensionality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694909090909">
To explain the togetherness effect, we have
developed a modal model inspired by Channel
Theory of Barwise and Seligman (1997). We
claim that the notion of togetherness is
interpretable in terms of channel or the linkage
of properties of the parts of a whole.
A whole regulating and coordinating the
internal behavior of its parts is a distributed
system or channel. A model considering
properties and types is intensional: knowing the
object type, one can predict its behavior.
A channel is thus defined by constraints that
universally quantify over types (and not entities
as in the extensional accounts), guaranteeing
that the linkage of the properties of the parts (i)
is regular (vs. accidental) for a given object type
and (ii) take place within the structure of the
distributed system.
Technically, a channel is defined as the
combination of two infomorphisms. The notion
of classification grounds the definitions in (10)
and (11).

We claim that avec signals the presence of a
distributed system regulating the properties of
the entities it links, in a regular way. In other
terms, the kind of association introduced by
avec can be represented by a channel. We can
thus formulate the abstract constraints defining
the behavior of avec:

We can now come back to the explanation of the
problematic data introduced in the discussion of
avec-comitativity and test our model.
The definition (12) establishes a clear
distinction between (7a) and (7b): avec in (7a)
signals the existence of an overall walk
coordinating the two separate walks of the
persons involved, where et in (7b) does not. It
follows that only (7a) enhances a scenario that
can be described by a channel. This under-
specified definition is specified as follows into
the meaning of comitativity:
(12) Avec-comitativity. In a structure NP1 VP
avec NP2, avec signals the existence of a
channel verifying the following conditions:
(i) it links the phases describing the events
involving the entities denoted by NP1 and
NP2,
(ii) each of the phases involving one of the
two entities implies that the phase
involving the other entity expresses an
actual or potential influence,
(iii) no other phases than the ones described in
the sentence can be evoked4.

Let us analyze this definition:
(i) Avec links the eventualities which
involve the entities denoted by NP1 and NP25.
(ii) The types describing these eventualities
are phases i.e. descriptions including the
possible previous and past developments of the
actual eventuality (Penczek, 1995).
Moreover, we have to note that the
constraints characterizing the channel present
modal types. This is licit within Channel Theory
and is particularly useful for our purposes.
We can conclude that the channel signaled
by avec-comitativity links the present, past and
future developments of the eventualities which
involve the denotations of NP1 and NP2.
4.3.1 Solution of the spatio-temporal
juxtaposition problem
Let us come back to the paradox of spatio-
temporal co-localisation. In most cases, avec is
used when two entities interact. Cadiot (1997)
considers this condition as necessary.
Nevertheless some cases of pure spatio-temporal
co-localisation are supported by avec, such as
(4a). They can now be easily explained.
Consider an example:
(13) A son insu, Jean s&apos;est retrouvé sur la
montagne avec un ours / Without knowing it,
John was on the mountain with a bear
In the referred state of affairs there is no
interaction between John and the bear.
Nevertheless, according to our experience, we
know that the particular location of a person and
a bear being on a mountain can evolve toward
an interaction by virtue of them being in the
same place. It is because John and the bear are
in the same place at the same time, that they
could interact. According to (13), this scenario
can be described by a channel that takes the
5 From now on, we will refer to the denotations of NP1
and NP2 by X and Y respectively.
form of potential interaction and links their
mutual positions.
This is not the case for the spatio-temporal
location of John and Chirac in (4b). In the case
where they would meet, it would not be by
virtue of their being both in Paris, at least not in
a default context; an extra eventuality should
intervene for John et Chirac to meet and this is
not allowed by (13) nor by the definition of
channel in (11). There is then no distributed
system regulating their particular spatio-
temporal properties.
The definition (13) also explains why in
some other cases avec is impossible. Consider
the window and the door of a living-room (5b):
the properties of their spatio-temporal locations
are not mutually regulated. This is why the
interpretation of the sentence enhances a
scenario in which someone has taken them down
in the course of a remaking of the house, for
instance.
The same explanation holds for (6b). Avec
forces an interpretation where the sadness (or
another property) of Mary influences the
sadness of John: avec signals a coordination of
the properties of the entities it links. The
definition in (12) forbids the interpretation that
&amp;quot;Jean is sad, Marie is sad, they are sad
independently from one another and they are sad
in the same spatio-temporal location&amp;quot;.

Let us recall the argumentation we have been
pursuing until now. Avec shows a very wide
contextual variability and the challenge is to
reconstruct a unique set of constraints
explaining the coherence of its semantic
spectrum. The meaning of comitativity has
offered a privileged way toward this set defined
in (12). This definition is quite abstract and is
differently instantiated into the other contextual
possibilities. The table 2 summarizes the
definitions that can be given to each of the
meanings listed in table 1.

of all, the distinction between notions and values
roughly corresponds to the sense / meaning. The
term notion, clearly implies that the definition
has a cognitive reality and is probably learned
and stored as such.
On the vertical level there is a difference in
nature between notions and values: notions can
be considered as models for values. The overall
abstract notion defined in (12) is a model for
avec.
The issue related to the predictive power of
our model is still open.
To affirm that a model is predictive means
to recognize that it is possible to generate all and
only the observed meanings by an appropriate
rule system. In spite of the fact that we have
reconstructed an under-specified and general
model for avec, we must recognize that it is
impossible by virtue of the definition in (12) to
generate all (and only) its meanings.
The main reason is philosophically evident:
to generate such meanings one should
previously know them and because we do not
have an access to all the existing corpora, it is
impossible to affirm that the model generates all
the possible meanings. This argument has been
well known since Wittgenstein (1953/1961).
Nevertheless, we believe that we can find
more than pure family resemblances. First of all,
even if very abstract, the polysemous domain of
prepositions seems well structured: the
definitions of the notions that we have
inductively found show that it is possible to
identify with a certain precision the semantic
domain of avec. Moreover, our model constrains
the licit interpretations.
It follows that in spite of being predictive,
our model allows to formulate inferences.
Consider the interface between semantics
and pragmatics. On a semantic level we have
admitted that avec creates a scenario that can be
described in terms of a distributed system
regularly linking the properties of two or more
entities / events. On a pragmatic level we can
conclude that when using avec, the speaker
wants to signal the existence of such a
correlation. The hearer will then infer that a
regular association exists between the entities /
events linked by avec in the sentence uttered by
the speaker, and that such an association must be
sought. Let us look at an example.
(17) Avec les stylos dans le verre, la police
donne des PV / With the pens in the glass the
police give parking tickets
Consider a situation where a speaker and a
hearer trust each other, that is to say, a situation
where pragmatic irrelevance is not a matter. If
the speaker utters a sentence such as (18), the
hearer will be looking for a non accidental
association between the events (as kind of
entities) associated by avec: namely the fact that
the pens are in the glass and that the police give
tickets.
This is exactly what the model we have
built for avec allows us to infer: the two events
of the pens being in the glass and the police
giving parking tickets are thought, said and
interpreted as regularly (vs. non accidentally)
associated.
This is the case for many familiar examples,
occurring in different syntactic environments:
(18) Avec la pluie, je suis de mauvais humeur /
With this rain, I am in a bad mood
(19) J’ai mis les verres avec les carafes / I put
the glasses with the pitchers
This observation leads us to conclude that
the model is expressive enough to be
generalized and to constrain the interpretations
of apparently very different meanings. A clearer
formalization of these speculative conclusions
on the contextual interpretation of under-
specified representations is currently under
construction.

We discuss the first of these questions in section 2 where we present the theoretical contention around the notion of polysemy of grammatical items and prepositions in particular, against which we will have to evaluate the results of our study. The second question will be illustrated in section 3 where we present the main meanings of avec and focus on comitativity, which, being more abstract then the others, seems to point directly to the underspecified set of constraints defining avec in general. In section 4 we briefly introduce a model inspired from Channel Theory (Barwise and Seligman, 1997) and we test it on the problematic data related to the meaning of comitativity. In section 5 we come back to the two remaining questions: we present a model for the whole semantic domain of avec by introducing the distinction among notions and values and discuss the inferential power of our model. Following Pinkal&apos;s distinction between sense and meaning (Pinkal, 1985, Poesio, 1996), we consider that senses tell us under which circumstances in the world the sentence is true or false, and that meanings assigned to an expression behaves as functions from contexts to senses. 2 Polysemy and context</context>

Classification of avec meanings. The meaning of comitativity, as argued by Cadiot (1997), stays in the middle of the spectrum of the semantic domain of the preposition avec: it is less constrained than the meaning of reciprocity and more specific than the meaning thematic. Compared to instrumental and manner, it is characterized by a notion of symmetry as will be discussed at length in the next section. Its privileged status clearly emerges from the definition given for the first time by Guillaume (1919/1975) and adopted by Cadiot (ibid.) in a recent study. Guillaume (ibid.: 279) defines the comitativity as follows1: “ the preposition avec is an abstract image of parallelism: it </context>
<context position="8384" citStr="Cadiot (1997)" startWordPosition="1344" endWordPosition="1345">ndamental from these citations: parallelism, interaction and finally association, which is strictly related to the first two. In the following section we show that the intuition grounding these definitions is correct, but that it is precisely the sense of association that needs an explanation: to define avec means to clearly formulate the constraints which need to be satisfied for two or more entities to be said &amp;quot;associated&amp;quot;. We admit that the meaning of comitativity has a privileged status and focus on it. 3.1 Cadiot&apos;s account of comitativity and problematic data On a phenomenological level, Cadiot (1997) analyzes the typical example of comitativity in (1), by a condition on symmetry (2) which implies a coordination (3): (1) Pierre marche avec Marie / Peter walks with Mary (2) a. If NP1 VP avec NP2 then, NP2 VP avec NP1 b. If “Pierre marche avec Marie”, then “Marie marche avec Pierre” (3) a. If NP1 VP avec NP2, then NP1 VP et NP2 GV b. If “Pierre marche avec Marie”, then “Pierre marche” and “Marie marche” These conditions properly describe the fact that in a situation where &amp;quot;Pierre walks with Mary&amp;quot; it is true that &amp;quot;Pierre walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marie walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pierre walks and Marie walks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marie walks with</context>

Moreover, we have to note that the constraints characterizing the channel present modal types. This is licit within Channel Theory and is particularly useful for our purposes. We can conclude that the channel signaled by avec-comitativity links the present, past and future developments of the eventualities which involve the denotations of NP1 and NP2. 4.3.1 Solution of the spatio-temporal juxtaposition problem Let us come back to the paradox of spatiotemporal co-localisation. In most cases, avec is used when two entities interact. Cadiot (1997) considers this condition as necessary. Nevertheless some cases of pure spatio-temporal co-localisation are supported by avec, such as (4a). They can now be easily explained. Consider an example: (13) A son insu, Jean s&apos;est retrouvé sur la montagne avec un ours / Without knowing it, John was on the mountain with a bear In the referred state of affairs there is no interaction between John and the bear. Nevertheless, according to our experience, we know that the particular location of a person and a bear being on a mountain can evolve toward an interaction by virtue of them being in the same pla</context>

In section 4 we briefly introduce a model inspired from Channel Theory (Barwise and Seligman, 1997) and we test it on the problematic data related to the meaning of comitativity. In section 5 we come back to the two remaining questions: we present a model for the whole semantic domain of avec by introducing the distinction among notions and values and discuss the inferential power of our model. Following Pinkal&apos;s distinction between sense and meaning (Pinkal, 1985, Poesio, 1996), we consider that senses tell us under which circumstances in the world the sentence is true or false, and that meanings assigned to an expression behaves as functions from contexts to senses. 2 Polysemy and contextual variability The notion of polysemy implies that (i) a word has many different meanings and that (ii) these meanings are in a certain way related to one another. A major issue is then to explain the phrase &amp;quot;in a certain way&amp;quot;. By virtue of what principles are they related? Is it by virtue of a unique sense that, together with a rule system allows to generate all of them, or simpl</context>

The discussion will be based on the study of avec (with) and the analysis of its abstract meaning of comitativity in particular. A model for avec semantic variability will also be suggested. 1 Introduction Through the study of the preposition avec we discuss some major questions related to the analysis and model of abstract prepositions. Avec is traditionally (Spang-Hanssen, 1963) considered as a mixed preposition. On one side, its contextual behavior is very heterogeneous: contrary to the colored prepositions (e.g. spatial), it seems difficult to construct a unique sense from which all the meanings are derived; nevertheless, contrary to the uncolored prepositions such as de (of) or à (to) in French, avec seems to point to an identifiable set of constraints. It is our aim to investigate whether this set exists and to determine its status. This requires an answer to the following questions: 1. How can the contextual variability of polysemous prepositions be mastered ? 2</context>

By virtue of what principles are they related? Is it by virtue of a unique sense that, together with a rule system allows to generate all of them, or simply by virtue of family resemblances ? More fundamentally, the notion of polysemy poses the major question of the relation between language and thought. It is not only a matter of discovering whether a unique sense exists, but also to determine whether this sense is cognitively grounded, or in other terms, whether it is pre-linguistic or perception based. Cognitive linguists such as Wierzbicka (1996) claim that all meanings are derived from a cognitive primitive-based dictionary by a cognitive grammar. Under her account, language is grounded in thought and polysemy is a consequence of the instantiation of thought into language, the cognitive dictionary being the glue of all the meanings of a polysemous word.

He argues that it is clearly impossible to define words by abstract meanings on the account of pure observation. Provocative, this affirmation poses the problem of the existence of rules and opens a series of other questions: do definitions of polysemous word exist? And what do these definitions look like? Is it possible for an abstract definition to coexist with local values not caught by this definition? What is their status then?

In spite of the fact that we have reconstructed an under-specified and general model for avec, we must recognize that it is impossible by virtue of the definition in (12) to generate all (and only) its meanings. The main reason is philosophically evident: to generate such meanings one should previously know them and because we do not have an access to all the existing corpora, it is impossible to affirm that the model generates all the possible meanings. This argument has been well known since Wittgenstein (1953/1961). Nevertheless, we believe that we can find more than pure family resemblances. First of all, even if very abstract, the polysemous domain of prepositions seems well structured: the definitions of the notions that we have inductively found show that it is possible to identify with a certain precision the semantic domain of avec. Moreover, our model constrains the licit interpretations. It follows that in spite of being predictive, our model allows to formulate inferences. Consider the interface between semantics and pragmatics. On a semantic level we have admitted that avec creates a sce</context>
