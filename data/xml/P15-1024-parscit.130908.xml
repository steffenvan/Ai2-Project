Understanding open-domain text is one
of the primary challenges in NLP. Ma-
chine comprehension evaluates the sys-
tem’s ability to understand text through
a series of question-answering tasks on
short pieces of text such that the correct
answer can be found only in the given text.
For this task, we posit that there is a hid-
den (latent) structure that explains the rela-
tion between the question, correct answer,
and text. We call this the answer-entailing
structure; given the structure, the correct-
ness of the answer is evident. Since the
structure is latent, it must be inferred. We
present a unified max-margin framework
that learns to find these hidden structures
(given a corpus of question-answer pairs),
and uses what it learns to answer machine
comprehension questions on novel texts.
We extend this framework to incorporate
multi-task learning on the different sub-
tasks that are required to perform machine
comprehension. Evaluation on a publicly
available dataset shows that our frame-
work outperforms various IR and neural-
network baselines, achieving an overall
accuracy of 67.8% (vs. 59.9%, the best
previously-published result.)

Developing an ability to understand natural lan-
guage is a long-standing goal in NLP and holds the
promise of revolutionizing the way in which peo-
ple interact with machines and retrieve informa-
tion (e.g., for scientific endeavor). To evaluate this
ability, Richardson et al. (2013) proposed the task
of machine comprehension (MCTest), along with

a dataset for evaluation. Machine comprehension
evaluates a machine’s understanding by posing a
series of reading comprehension questions and as-
sociated texts, where the answer to each question
can be found only in its associated text. Solutions
typically focus on some semantic interpretation of
the text, possibly with some form of probabilistic
or logical inference, in order to answer the ques-
tions. Despite significant recent interest (Burges,
2013; Weston et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2015),
the problem remains unsolved.
In this paper, we propose an approach for ma-
chine comprehension. Our approach learns latent
answer-entailing structures that can help us an-
swer questions about a text. The answer-entailing
structures in our model are closely related to the
inference procedure often used in various mod-
els for MT (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006), RTE
(MacCartney et al., 2008), paraphrase (Yao et al.,
2013b), QA (Yih et al., 2013), etc. and correspond
to the best (latent) alignment between a hypoth-
esis (formed from the question and a candidate
answer) with appropriate snippets in the text that
are required to answer the question. An example
of such an answer-entailing structure is given in
Figure 1. The key difference between the answer-
entailing structures considered here and the align-
ment structures considered in previous works is
that we can align multiple sentences in the text
to the hypothesis. The sentences in the text con-
sidered for alignment are not restricted to occur
contiguously in the text. To allow such a dis-
contiguous alignment, we make use of the docu-
ment structure; in particular, we take help from
rhetorical structure theory (Mann and Thomp-
son, 1988) and event and entity coreference links
across sentences. Modelling the inference proce-
dure via answer-entailing structures is a crude yet
effective and computationally inexpensive proxy
to model the semantics needed for the problem.
Learning these latent structures can also be bene-

ficial as they can assist a human in verifying the
correctness of the answer, eliminating the need to
read a lengthy document.
The overall model is trained in a max-margin
fashion using a latent structural SVM (LSSVM)
where the answer-entailing structures are latent.
We also extend our LSSVM to multi-task set-
tings using a top-level question-type classification.
Many QA systems include a question classifica-
tion component (Li and Roth, 2002; Zhang and
Lee, 2003), which typically divides the questions
into semantic categories based on the type of the
question or answers expected. This helps the sys-
tem impose some constraints on the plausible an-
swers. Machine comprehension can benefit from
such a pre-classification step, not only to constrain
plausible answers, but also to allow the system to
use different processing strategies for each cate-
gory. Recently, Weston et al. (2015) defined a
set of 20 sub-tasks in the machine comprehen-
sion setting, each referring to a specific aspect of
language understanding and reasoning required to
build a machine comprehension system. They in-
clude fact chaining, negation, temporal and spatial
reasoning, simple induction, deduction and many
more. We use this set to learn to classify ques-
tions into the various machine comprehension sub-
tasks, and show that this task classification fur-
ther improves our performance on MCTest. By
using the multi-task setting, our learner is able to
exploit the commonality among tasks where pos-
sible, while having the flexibility to learn task-
specific parameters where needed. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first use of multi-task
learning in a structured prediction model for QA.
We provide experimental validation for our
model on a real-world dataset (Richardson et al.,
2013) and achieve superior performance vs. a
number of IR and neural network baselines.

2 The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998847785714285">
Machine comprehension requires us to answer
questions based on unstructured text. We treat this
as selecting the best answer from a set of can-
didate answers. The candidate answers may be
pre-defined, as is the case in multiple-choice ques-
tion answering, or may be undefined but restricted
(e.g., to yes, no, or any noun phrase in the text).
Machine Comprehension as Textual Entail-
ment: Let for each question qi E Q, ti be the
unstructured text and Ai = {aii, ... , aim} be
the set of candidate answers to the question. We
cast the machine comprehension task as a tex-
tual entailment task by converting each question-
answer candidate pair (qi, ai,d) into a hypothe-
sis statement hid. For example, the question
“What did Alyssa eat at the restaurant?” and
answer candidate “Catfish” in Figure 1 can be
combined to achieve a hypothesis “Alyssa ate
Catfish at the restaurant”. We use the question
matching/rewriting rules described in Cucerzan
and Agichtein (2005) to achieve this transforma-
tion. For each question qi, the machine com-
prehension task reduces to picking the hypothe-
sis ˆhi that has the highest likelihood of being en-
tailed by the text among the set of hypotheses
hi = {hii, ... , him} generated for that question.
Let h∗i E hi be the correct hypothesis. Now let us
define the latent answer-entailing structures.

pothesis. We consider the quality of a one-to-
one word alignment from a hypothesis to snippets
in the text as a proxy for the evidence. Hypoth-
esis words are aligned to a unique text word in
the text or an empty word. For example, in Fig-
ure 1, all words but “at” are aligned to a word
in the text. The word “at” can be assumed to be
aligned to an empty word and it has no effect on
the model. Learning these alignment edges typi-
cally helps a model decompose the input and out-
put structures into semantic constituents and de-
termine which constituents should be compared to
each other. These alignments can then be used to
generate more effective features.
The alignment depends on two things: (a) snip-
pets in the text to be aligned to the hypothesis
and (b) word alignment from the hypothesis to the
snippets. We explore three variants of the snippets
in the text to be aligned to the hypothesis. The
choice of these snippets composed with the word
alignment is the resulting hidden structure called
an answer-entailing structure.

<listItem confidence="0.994226909090909">
1. Sentence Alignment: The simplest variant is to
find a single sentence in the text that best aligns to
the hypothesis. This is the structure considered in
a majority of previous works in RTE (MacCartney
et al., 2008) and QA (Yih et al., 2013) as they only
reason on single sentence length texts.
2. Subset Alignment: Here we find a subset of sen-
tences from the text (instead of just one sentence)
that best aligns with the hypothesis.
3. Subset+ Alignment: This is the same as above
except that the best subset is an ordered set.

A natural solution is to treat MCTest as a
structured prediction problem of ranking the
hypotheses hi such that the correct hypothesis
is at the top of this ranking. This induces a
constraint on the ranking structure that the correct
hypothesis is ranked above the other competing
hypotheses. For each text ti and hypotheses
set hi, let Yi be the set of possible orderings
of the hypotheses. Let y∗i E Yi be a correct
ranking (such that the correct hypothesis is at
the top of this ranking). Let the set of possible
answer-entailing structures for each text hypoth-
esis pair (ti, hi) be denoted by Zi. For each text
ti, with hypotheses set hi, an ordering of the
hypotheses y E Yi, and hidden structure z E Zi.
we define a scoring function Score,(ti, hi, z, y)
parameterized by a weight vector w such
that we have the prediction rule: ( byi, bzi) =
arg maxYEYi,ZEZi Score,(ti, hi, z, y). The
learning task is to find w such that the predicted
ordering byi is close to the optimal ordering
y∗i . Mathematically this can be written as
min, 12�w�2 + C Pi Δ(y∗ i , z∗ i , byi, bzi) where
z∗i =arg maxZEZi Score,(ti, hi, z, y∗ i ) and
Δ is the loss function between the predicted
and the actual ranking and latent structure.
We simplify the loss function and assume
it to be independent of the hidden structure
(Δ(y∗ i , z∗ i , byi, bzi) = Δ(y∗ i , byi))and use a lin-
ear scoring function: Score,(ti, hi, z, y) =
wT φ(ti, hi, z, y) where φ is a feature map
dependent on the text ti, the hypothesis set hi, an
ordering of answers y and a hidden structure z.
We use a convex upper bound of the loss function
(Yu and Joachims, 2009) to rewrite the objective:

This problem can be solved using Concave-
Convex Programming (Yuille and Rangarajan,
2003) with the cutting plane algorithm for struc-
tural SVM (Finley and Joachims, 2008). We use
phi partial order (Joachims, 2006; Dubey et al.,
2009) which has been used in previous structural
ranking literature to incorporate ranking structure
in the feature vector φ:

where, cj(y) = 1 if h∗ i is above hij in the ranking
y else −1. We use pair preference (Chakrabarti et
al., 2008) as the ranking loss Δ(y∗i , y). Here, ψ
is the feature vector defined for a text, hypothesis
and answer-entailing structure.
Solution: We substitute the feature map definition
(2) into Equation 1, leading to our LSSVM formu-
lation. We consider the optimization as an alter-
nating minimization problem where we alternate
between getting the best zij and ψ for each text-
hypothesis pair given w (inference) and then solv-
ing for the weights w given ψ to obtain an opti-
mal ordering of the hypothesis (learning). The step
for solving for the weights is similar to rankSVM

that in step 3, when the answer-entailing structures
are “Subset” or “Subset+”, we can always get a

chine comprehension is a complex task which of-
ten requires us to interpret questions, the kind of
answers they seek as well as the kinds of inference
required to solve them. Many approaches in QA
(Moldovan et al., 2003; Ferrucci, 2012) solve this
by having a top-level classifier that categorizes the
complex task into a variety of sub-tasks. The sub-
tasks can correspond to various categories of ques-
tions that can be asked or various facets of text un-
derstanding that are required to do well at machine
comprehension in its entirety.It is well known that
learning a sub-task together with other related sub-
tasks leads to a better solution for each sub-task.
Hence, we consider learning classifications of the
sub-tasks and then using multi-task learning.
We extend our LSSVM to multi-task settings.
Let S be the number of sub-tasks. We assume
that the predictor w for each subtask s is par-
titioned into two parts: a parameter w0 that is
globally shared across each subtasks and a pa-
rameter vs that is locally used to provide for the
variations within the particular subtask: w =
w0 + vs. Mathematically we define the scoring
function for text ti, hypothesis set hi of the sub-
task s to be Scorew0,v,s(ti, hi, z, y) = (w0 +
vs)T φ(ti, hi, z, y). The objective in this case is

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851571428571">
Now, we extend a trick that Evgeniou and Pon-
til (2004) used on linear SVM to reformulate this
problem into an objective that looks like (1). Such
reformulation will help in using algorithm 1 to
solve the multi-task problem as well. Lets define a
new feature map Φs, one for each sub-task s using
the old feature map φ as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9045996">
Φs(ti, hi, z, y) = (φ(ti, hi, z, y)
µ

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999136045454545">
where µ = Sλ2
λ1 and the 0 denotes the zero
vector of the same size as φ. Also define our
new predictor as w = (√µw0, v1, ... , vS).
Using this formulation we can show that
wT Φs(ti, hi, z, y) = (w0 + vs)T φ(ti, hi, z, y)
and kwk2 = Es kvsk2 + µkw0k2. Hence, if we
now define the objective (1) but use the new fea-
ture map and w then we will get back our multi-
task objective (3). Thus we can use the same setup
as before for multi-task learning after appropri-
ately changing the feature map. We will explore
a few definitions of sub-tasks in our experiments.
Features: Recall that our features had the form
ψ(t, h, z) where the hypothesis h was itself
formed from a question q and answer candidate a.
Given an answer-entailing structure z, we induce
the following features based on word level sim-
ilarity of aligned words: (a) Limited word-level
surface-form matching and (b) Semantic word
form matching: Word similarity for synonymy us-
ing SENNA word vectors (Collobert et al., 2011),

“Antonymy” ‘Class-Inclusion’ or ‘Is-A’ relations
using Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998). We compute ad-
ditional features of the aforementioned kinds to
match named entities and events. We also add
features for matching local neighborhood in the
aligned structure: features for matching bigrams,
trigrams, dependencies, semantic roles, predicate-
argument structure as well as features for match-
ing global structure: a tree kernel for matching
syntactic representations of entire sentences us-
ing Srivastava and Hovy (2013). The local and
global features can use the RST and coreference
links enabling inference across sentences. For in-
stance, in the example shown in figure 1, the coref-
erence link connecting the two “restaurant” words
brings the snippets “Alyssa enjoyed the” and “had
a special on catfish” closer making these features
more effective. The answer-entailing structures
should be intuitively similar to the question but
also the answer. Hence, we add features that are
the product of features for the text-question match
and text-answer match.
String edit Features: In addition to looking for
features on exact word/phrase match, we also add
features using two paraphrase databases ParaPara
(Chan et al., 2011) and DIRT (Lin and Pantel,
2001). The ParaPara database contains strings of
the form string1 → string2 like “total lack of” →
“lack of”, “is one of” → “among”, etc. Simi-
larly, the DIRT database contains paraphrases of
the form “If X decreases Y then X reduces Y”, “If
X causes Y then X affects Y”, etc. Whenever we
have a substring in the text can be transformed into
another using these two databases, we keep match
features for the substring with a higher score (ac-
cording to w) and ignore the other substring.
The sentences with discourse relations are related
to each other by means of substitution, ellipsis,
conjunction and lexical cohesion, etc (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) and can help us answer certain
kinds of questions (Jansen et al., 2014). As an ex-
ample, the “cause” relation between sentences in
the text can often give cues that can help us an-
swer “why” or “how” questions. Hence, we add
additional features - conjunction of the RST label
and the question word - to our feature vector. Sim-
ilarly, the entity and event co-reference relations
can allows the system to reason about repeating
entities or events through all the sentences they get
mentioned in. Thus, we add additional features of
the aforementioned types by replacing entity men-
tions with their first mentions.
Subset+ Features: We add an additional set of fea-
tures which match the first sentence in the ordered
set to the question and the last sentence in the or-
dered set to the answer. This helps in the case
when a certain portion of the text is targeted by
the question but then it must be used in combina-
tion with another sentence to answer the question.
For instance, in Figure 1, sentence 2 mentions the
target of the question but the answer can only be
given when in combination with sentence 1.
Negation We empirically found that one key lim-
itation in our formulation is its inability to handle
negation (both in questions and text). Negation
is especially hurtful to our model as it not only
results in poor performance on questions that re-
quire us to reason with negated facts, it provides
our model with a wrong signal (facts usually align
well with their negated versions). We use a simple
heuristic to overcome the negation problem. We
detect negation (either in the hypothesis or a sen-
tence in the text snippet aligned to it) using a small
set of manually defined rules that test for presence
of words such as “not”, “n’t”, etc. Then, we flip
the partial order - i.e. the correct hypothesis is now
ranked below the other competing hypotheses. For
inference at test time, we also invert the prediction
rule i.e. we predict the hypothesis (answer) that
has the least score under the model.

Datasets: We use two datasets for our evaluation.
(1) First is the MCTest-500 dataset 1, a freely
available set of 500 stories (split into 300 train,
50 dev and 150 test) and associated questions
(Richardson et al., 2013). The stories are fictional
so the answers can be found only in the story it-
self. The stories and questions are carefully lim-
ited, thereby minimizing the world knowledge re-
quired for this task. Yet, the task is challenging for
most modern NLP systems. Each story in MCTest
has four multiple choice questions, each with four
answer choices. Each question has only one cor-
rect answer. Furthermore, questions are also anno-
tated with ‘single’ and ‘multiple’ labels. The ques-
tions annotated ‘single’ only require one sentence
in the story to answer them. For ‘multiple’ ques-
tions it should not be possible to find the answer
to the question in any individual sentence of the
passage. In a sense, the ‘multiple’ questions are

3Note that the bAbI dataset is artificial and not meant for
open-domain machine comprehension. It is a toy dataset gen-
harder than the ‘single’ questions as they typically
require complex lexical analysis, some inference
and some form of limited reasoning. Cucerzan-
converted questions can also be downloaded from
the MCTest website.
(2) The second dataset is a synthetic dataset
released under the bAbI project2 (Weston et al.,
2015). The dataset presents a set of 20 ‘tasks’,
each testing a different aspect of text understand-
ing and reasoning in the QA setting, and hence
can be used to test and compare capabilities of
learning models in a fine-grained manner. For
each ‘task’, 1000 questions are used for training
and 1000 for testing. The ‘tasks’ refer to question
categories such as questions requiring reasoning
over single/two/three supporting facts or two/three
arg. relations, yes/no questions, counting ques-
tions, etc. Candidate answers are not provided but
the answers are typically constrained to a small
set: either yes or no or entities already appear-
ing in the text, etc. We write simple rules to con-
vert the question and answer candidate pairs to hy-
potheses. 3
Baselines: We have five baselines. (1) The first
three baselines are inspired from Richardson et
al. (2013). The first baseline (called SW) uses
a sliding window and matches a bag of words
constructed from the question and hypothesized
answer to the text. (2) Since this ignores long
range dependencies, the second baseline (called
SW+D) accounts for intra-word distances as well.
As far as we know, SW+D is the best previ-
ously published result on this task.4 (3) The
third baseline (called RTE) uses textual entail-
ment to answer MCTest questions. For this base-
line, MCTest is again re-casted as an RTE task
by converting each question-answer pair into a
statement (using Cucerzan and Agichtein (2005))
and then selecting the answer whose statement
has the highest likelihood of being entailed by the
erated from a simulated world. Due to its restrictive nature,
we do not use it directly in evaluating our method vs. other
open-domain machine comprehension methods. However,
it provides benefit in identifying interesting subtasks of ma-
chine comprehension. As will be seen, we are able to lever-
age the dataset both to improve our multi-task learning algo-
rithm, as well as to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of
our model.

QUANTA) for comparison in this paper both of which achieve
superior performance to SW+D.
story. 5 (4) The fourth baseline (called LSTM)
is taken from Weston et al. (2015). The base-
line uses LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) to accomplish the task. LSTMs have re-
cently achieved state-of-the-art results in a vari-
ety of tasks due to their ability to model long-
term context information as opposed to other neu-
ral networks based techniques. (5) The fifth base-
line (called QANTA)6 is taken from Iyyer et al.
(2014). QANTA too uses a recursive neural net-
work for question answering.
Task Classification for MultiTask Learning:
We consider three alternative task classifications
for our experiments. First, we look at question
classification. We use a simple question classi-
fication based on the question word (what, why,
what, etc.). We call this QClassification. Next, we
also use a question/answer classification7 from Li
and Roth (2002). This classifies questions into dif-
ferent semantic classes based on the possible se-
mantic types of the answers sought. We call this
QAClassification. Finally, we also learn a clas-
sifier for the 20 tasks in the Machine Compre-
hension gamut described in Weston et al. (2015).
The classification algorithm (called TaskClassifi-
cation) was built on the bAbI training set. It is
essentially a Naive-Bayes classifier and uses only
simple unigram and bigram features for the ques-
tion and answer. The tasks typically correspond
to different strategies when looking for an answer
in the machine comprehension setting. In our ex-
periments we will see that learning these strategies
is better than learning the question answer classi-
fication which is in turn better than learning the
question classification.
Results: We compare multiple variants of our
LSSVM8 where we consider a variety of answer-
entailing structures and our modification for nega-
tion and multi-task LSSVM, where we consider
three kinds of task classification strategies against
the baselines on the MCTest dataset. We con-
sider two evaluation metrics: accuracy (propor-
tion of questions correctly answered) and NDCG4

(J¨arvelin and Kek¨al¨ainen, 2002). Unlike classifi-
cation accuracy which evaluates if the prediction is
correct or not, NDCG4, being a measure of rank-
ing quality, evaluates the position of the correct
answer in our predicted ranking.
Figure 2 describes the comparison on MCTest.
We can observe that all the LSSVM models have
a better performance than all the five baselines
(including LSTMs and RNNs which are state-of-
the-art for many other NLP tasks) on both met-
rics. Very interestingly, LSSVMs have a consid-
erable improvement over the baselines for “mul-
tiple” questions. We posit that this is because of
our answer-entailing structure alignment strategy
which is a weak proxy to the deep semantic in-
ference procedure required for machine compre-
hension. The RTE baseline achieves the best per-
formance on the “single” questions. This is per-
haps because the RTE community has almost en-
tirely focused on single sentence text hypothesis
pairs for a long time. However, RTE fares pretty
poorly on the “multiple” questions indicating that
of-the-shelf RTE systems cannot perform infer-
ence across large texts.
Figure 2 also compares the performance of
LSSVM variants when various answer-entailing
structures are considered. Here we observe a clear
benefit of using the alignment to the best subset
structure over alignment to best sentence structure.
We furthermore see improvements when the best
subset alignment structure is augmented with the
subset+ features. We can observe that the negation
heuristic also helps, especially for “single” ques-
tions (majority of negation cases in the MCTest
dataset are for the “single” questions).
It is also interesting to see that the multi-task
learners show a substantial boost over the sin-
gle task SSVM. Also, it can be observed that
the multi-task learner greatly benefits if we can
learn a separation between the various strategies
needed to learn an overarching list of subtasks re-
quired to solve the machine comprehension task. 9

6 Strengths and Weaknesses

A good question to be asked is how good is struc-
ture alignment as a proxy to the semantics of the
problem? In this section, we attempt to tease out
the strengths and limitations of such a structure
alignment approach for machine comprehension.
To do so, we evaluate our methods on various tasks
in the bAbl dataset.For the bAbI dataset, we add
additional features inspired from the “task” dis-
tinction to handle specific “tasks”.
In our experiments, we observed a similar gen-
eral pattern of improvement of LSSVM over the
baselines as well as the improvement due to multi-
task learning. Again task classification helped
the multi-task learner the most and the QA clas-
sification helped more than the QClassification.
It is interesting here to look at the performance
within the sub-tasks. Negation improved the per-
formance for three sub-tasks, namely, the tasks
of modelling “yes/no questions”, “simple nega-
tions” and “indefinite knowledge” (the “Indefinite
Knowledge” sub-task tests the ability to model
statements that describe possibilities rather than
certainties). Each of these sub-tasks contain a sig-
nificant number of negation cases. Our models do
especially well on questions requiring reasoning
over one and two supporting facts, two arg. rela-
tions, indefinite knowledge, basic and compound
coreference and conjunction. Our models achieve
lower accuracy better than the baselines on two
sub-tasks, namely “path finding” and “agent mo-
tivations”. Our model along with the baselines
do not do too well on the “counting” sub-task, al-
though we get slightly better scores. The “count-
ing” sub-task (which asks about the number of ob-
jects with a certain property) requires the inference
to have an ability to perform simple counting op-
erations. The “path finding” sub-task requires the
inference to reason about the spatial path between
locations (e.g. Pittsburgh is located on the west
of New York). The “agents motivations” sub-task
asks questions such as ‘why an agent performs
a certain action’. As inference is cheaply mod-
elled via alignment structure, we lack the ability
to deeply reason about facts or numbers. This is
an important challenge for future work.

The field of QA is quite rich. Most QA evaluations
such as TREC have typically focused on short
factoid questions. The solutions proposed have
ranged from various IR based approaches (Mittal
and Mittal, 2011) that treat this as a problem of re-
trieval from existing knowledge bases and perform
some shallow inference to NLP approaches that
learn a similarity between the question and a set of
candidate answers (Yih et al., 2013). A majority of
these approaches do not focus on doing any deeper
inference. However, the task of machine compre-
hension requires an ability to perform inference
over paragraph length texts to seek the answer.
This is challenging for most IR and NLP tech-
niques. In this paper, we presented a strategy for
learning answer-entailing structures that helped us
perform inference over much longer texts by treat-
ing this as a structured input-output problem.
The approach of treating a problem as one of
mapping structured inputs to structured outputs is
common across many NLP applications. Exam-
ples include word or phrase alignment for bitexts
in MT (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006), text-hypothesis
alignment in RTE (Sammons et al., 2009; Mac-
Cartney et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2013a; Sultan
et al., 2014), question-answer alignment in QA
(Berant et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2013; Yao and
Van Durme, 2014), etc. Again all of these ap-
proaches align local parts of the input to local parts
of the output. In this work, we extended the word
alignment formalism to align multiple sentences
in the text to the hypothesis. We also incorpo-
rated the document structure (rhetorical structures
(Mann and Thompson, 1988)) and co-reference to
help us perform inference over longer documents.
QA has had a long history of using pipeline
models that extract a limited number of high-level
features from induced representations of question-
answer pairs, and then built a classifier using some
labelled corpora. On the other hand we learnt
these structures and performed machine com-
prehension jointly through a unified max-margin
framework. We note that there exist some recent
models such as Yih et al. (2013) that do model QA
by automatically defining some kind of alignment
between the question and answer snippets and use
a similar structured input-output model. However,
they are limited to single sentence answers.

Another advantage of our approach is its sim-
ple and elegant extension to multi-task settings.
There has been a rich vein of work in multi-task
learning for SVMs in the ML community. Evge-
niou and Pontil (2004) proposed a multi-task SVM
formulation assuming that the multi-task predictor
w factorizes as the sum of a shared and a task-
specific component. We used the same idea to
propose a multi-task variant of Latent Structured
SVMs. This allows us to use the single task SVM
in the multi-task setting with a different feature
mapping. This is much simpler than other compet-
ing approaches such as Zhu et al. (2011) proposed
in the literature for multi-task LSSVM.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995985">
In this paper, we addressed the problem of ma-
chine comprehension which tests language under-
standing through multiple choice question answer-
ing tasks. We posed the task as an extension to
RTE. Then, we proposed a solution by learning la-
tent alignment structures between texts and the hy-
potheses in the equivalent RTE setting. The task
requires solving a variety of sub-tasks so we ex-
tended our technique to a multi-task setting. Our
technique showed empirical improvements over
various IR and neural network baselines. The la-
tent structures while effective are cheap proxies
to the reasoning and language understanding re-
quired for this task and have their own limitations.
We also discuss strengths and limitations of our
model in a more fine-grained analysis. In the fu-
ture, we plan to use logic-like semantic represen-
tations of texts, questions and answers and explore
approaches to perform structured inference over
richer semantic representations.

Machine comprehension evaluates the system’s ability to understand text through a series of question-answering tasks on short pieces of text such that the correct answer can be found only in the given text. For this task, we posit that there is a hidden (latent) structure that explains the relation between the question, correct answer, text. We call this the given the structure, the correctness of the answer is evident. Since the structure is latent, it must be inferred. We present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer machine comprehension questions on novel texts. We extend this framework to incorporate multi-task learning on the different subtasks that are required to perform machine comprehension. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that our framework outperforms various IR and neuralnetwork baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 67.8% (vs. 59.9%, the best previously-published result.)</abstract>
