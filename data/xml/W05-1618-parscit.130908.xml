Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999931545454546">
Instructional texts consist of sequences of instruc-
tions designed in order to reach an objective. The
author or the generator of instructional texts must
follow a number of principles to guarantee that the
text is of any use. Similarly, a user must follow
step by step the instructions in order to reach the
results expected. In this paper, we explore facets of
instructional texts: general prototypical structures,
rhetorical structure and natural argumentation. Our
study is based on an extensive corpus study with
the aim of generating such texts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873484848485">
Instructional texts, also equivalently called procedural texts,
consist of a sequence of instructions, designed with some ac-
curacy in order to reach an objective (e.g. assemble a com-
puter). Procedural texts explain how to realize a certain goal
by means of actions which are at least partially temporally
organized.
Procedural texts often exhibit a quite complex rational and
’irrational’ structure, outlining different ways to realize some-
thing, with arguments, advices, conditions, hypothesis, pref-
erences, evaluations, user stimulations, etc. They also often
contain a number of recommendations, warnings, and com-
ments of various sorts.
Another feature is that procedural texts tend to minimize
the distance between language and action. Plans to realize a
goal are made as immediate and explicit as necessary, the ob-
jective being to reduce the inferences that the user will have
to make before acting, and therefore potential errors or mis-
understandings.
In our perspective, procedural texts range from appar-
ently simple cooking receipes to large maintenance manuals
(whose paper versions are measured in tons e.g. for aircraft
maintenance). They also include documents as diverse as
teaching texts, medical notices, social behavior recommen-
dations, directions for use, assembly notices, do-it-yourself
notices, itinerary guides, advice texts, savoir-faire guides etc.
Procedural texts obey more or less to a number of structural
criteria, which may depend on the author’s writing abilities
and on traditions associated with a given domain. There is
obviously a big contrast between maintenance manuals and
people magazines which both contains such texts. Procedu-
ral texts can be regulatory, procedural, programmatory, pre-
scriptive, injunctive, or may introduce advices (for social of
psychological behavior) [1].
The study we present in this paper has three main goals:
First, to be able to accurately respond in natural lan-
guage to (procedural) questions. Procedural
question answering systems are much of interest both
to large public via the web, and to more technical staff
for example to query large textual databases dedicated
to various types of procedures [6].
Next, to be able to select the best text (assuming a single
text is selected as a response) w.r.t. the user profile when
there are several responses (a frequent phenomenon on
the Web),
Finally, and for the long term, to be able to merge proce-
dural texts or fragments of procedural texts to construct
an optimal text, in terms of level of detail, illustration,
etc. Integrating texts is obviouly a long-term challenge.
This paper basically relates the structure ofprocedural texts
as they are in French. English translations of examples are
just glosses, they are given when space constraints permit.
We believe that besides language realization variants, most of
the characteristics we present here are language neutral. This
study is based on an extensive corpus study, within a language
production perspective. This approach allows us to integrate
logical, linguistic (e.g. [17], [5]) and philosophical views of
argumentation.
In this paper we first introduce some elements of a general
typology of procedural texts, outlining the number of com-
ponents, rational and irrational, that compose them. We then
give the most important structural elements, and the rhetorical
structure that characterizes the relations between elements.
Finally, we focus on argumentation, a major dimension of
procedural texts and we briefly present the forms of argu-
ments which are the most important, and under what con-
straints they can be generated.

2.1 General typology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905411764706">
Procedural texts have been studied in psycholinguistic, lin-
guistic and didactic circles. We briefly survey various ap-
proaches here, outlining elements of interest for our objec-
tives.
Under the heading of procedural texts, there is a quite large
diversity of texts. J.M. Adam [1] notices the variability of
judgments in procedural text categorization. Texts can, for
example, be grouped into families according to their main
objectives and style. We have, for example:
regulatory texts [16] that characterize expected be-
haviours,
procedural texts [13] defined as rather liear sets of in-
structions,
’programmatory’ texts [11] which include receipes, mu-
sical scores and architectory plan, identifie how knowl-
edge from an expert is transferred via these texts to
users who are expected to follow strictly the instructions
which are given.
instructional-prescriptive texts [21], where a quite de-
tailed analysis of temporal and event structures is carried
out,
injunctive texts, where [2] show the form and style used
in short notices that relate e.g. fire instructions, security
measures, etc.,
advice texts [14], which include advice texts of various
sorts, such as those found in large public magazines.
receipe texts [18], which is a domain quite well-studied,
for example in language generation.
Despite their goals, all these forms share common struc-
tures: specification of goals, description of lists of pre-
requisites to reach the goal, and description of sequences
of instructions. They also share common stylistic forms,
e.g. preferences for imperative forms, and a number of ty-
pographic elements such as enumerations.

2.2 Informational content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999563307692307">
Two works will be used as the starting point of the develop-
ment of the discursive structure of procedural texts that we
have elaborated (see section 3.). G.R. Bieger [7] propose
a taxonomy of the contents of instructions in 9 points: in-
ventory (objects and concepts used), description (of objects
and concepts), operational (information that suggest the agent
how to realize an action), spatial (spatial data about the ac-
tions), contextual, covariance (of actions, which evolve in
conjunction), temporal, qualificative (manners, limits of an
information), emphatic (redirects attention to another action).
One of the main works in Computational Linguistics is due
to [12]. She isolated 9 main structures or operations, called
semantic elements from corpus analysis:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998671625">
1. sequential operations: a necessary action that the agent
must realize,
2. object attribute: description meant to help understand
the action to realize,
3. material conditions: environment in which an action
must be carried out,
4. effects: consequences of the realization of a group of
operations on the world,
5. influences: explain why and how and operation must be
realized,
6. co-temporal operations: expresses synchronization of
operations,
7. options: optional operations,
8. preventions: describes actions to be avoided,
9. possible operations: possible operations to do in the fu-
ture.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997646">
She also identified 7 rhetorical relations (sequence, c-
condition, elaboration, goal, result, manner, concurrence)
which present those semantic elements. She positionned her
work on automatic text generation : how to select the infor-
mation and how to present it into a coherent text.

2.3 Argumentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971">
Procedural texts are specific forms of discourse, satisfying
constraints of economy of means, accuracy, etc. They are
in general based on a specific discursive logic, made up of
presuppositions, causes and consequences, goals, inductions,
warnings, anaphoric networks, etc., and more psychological
elements (e.g. to stimulate a user). The goal is to optimize a
logical sequencing of instructions and make the user feel safe
and confident with respect to the goal(s) he wants to achieve
(e.g. clean an oil filter, learn how to organize a customer
meeting).
Procedural texts, from this point of view, can be analyzed
not only just as sequences of mere instructions, but as effi-
cient, one-way (i.e. no contradiction, no negotiation) argu-
mentative discourses, designed to help a user to reach a goal,
making the best decisions (see e.g. [3], [4]). This type of dis-
course contains a number of facets, which are all associated
in a way to argumentation. Given a certain goal, it is also
of much interest to compare or contrast the means used by
different authors, possibly for different audiences.
In most types of procedural texts, in particular social be-
havior, communication, etc. procedural discourse has two
dimensions: an explicative component, constructed around
rational and objective elements, and a seduction component
whose goal is (1) to encourage the user, (2) to help him re-
vise his opinions, (3) to enrich the goals and the purposes, by
outlining certain properties or qualities or consequences of a
certain action or prevention.
Producing explanations is a rather synthetic activity whose
goal is to use the elements introduced by knowledge ex-
plicitation mechanisms to induce generalizations, subsump-
tions, deductions, relations between objects or activities and
the goals to reach. This is particularly visible in the lexical
choices made and in the choice of some constructions, includ-
ing typographic; procedural discourse is basically interactive:
it communicates, teaches, justifies, explains, warns, forbids,
stimulates, evaluates.
Let us finally note a few NLG-oriented papers centered on
the generation of arguments such as [22], which focus on
generic types of arguments (ad absurdum, from cases, etc.)
and [8].

3 A Discursive analysis of procedural texts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99809724137931">
The complexity of procedural texts leads us to proceed very
gradually in the study of their structure before being able to
produce even simple such texts. At an intermediate level, re-
sponding in natural language to questions, using un-
derspecified templates is an interesting step which can be
evaluated.
We collected a corpus of procedural texts from which we
extracted the main structure via the design of a grammar.
The corpus contains several types of procedural texts: re-
ceipes, maintenance manuals, medical notices, assembly, ad-
vice texts, etc. The grammar was enriched as the analysis
progresses. Finally a second corpus was gathered to conduct a
manual evaluation of the grammar. An annotation tool based
on the grammar and on related marks has been developped in
order to automatically evaluate on larger samples. The struc-
tures reported below essentially correspond to (1) the organi-
zation of the informational contents: how tasks are planned,
according to goals and subgoals, and (2) to the argumentative
strategies used (planning, progression of tasks, warnings, ad-
vices, evaluations, etc.). General principles of argumentative
discourse are given e.g. in [9].
In what follows, parentheses express optionality, + it-
eration, the comma is just a separator with no temporal
connotation a priori, / is an or and the operator indicates
a preferred precedence. Each symbol corresponds to an
XML-tag, allowing us to annotate procedural texts,.
The top node is termed objective:
objective title, (summary), (warning)+, (pre-
requisites), (picture)+ instruction sequences.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.509308" genericHeader="method">
summary title+
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975003612244898">
Summary describes the global organization of the procedure,
it may be useful when procedures are complex (summary can
be a set of hyper-links, often pointing to titles).
warning text, (picture)+, (pre-requisites).
pre-requisites list of objects, instruction sequences.
Pre-requisites describe all kinds of equipments needed to
realize the action (e.g. the different constituents of a receipe)
and preparatory actions. It may also include presuppositions
on the user profile and abilities.
picture describes a sequence of charts and/or schemas
of various sorts. They often interact with instructions by e.g.
making them more clear.
Instruction sequences is structured as follows:
instruction sequences instseq discursive con-
nector instruction sequences / instseq.
instseq is then of one of four main types below:
instseq (goal), imperative linear sequence / (goal),
optional sequence / (goal), alternative sequence / (goal),
imperative co-temporal sequence.
Goal may contain, besides the target itself motivations,
manners, references etc.
Each type of instruction sequence is defined as follows:
imperative linear sequence instruction (tempo-
ral mark), imperative linear sequence/ instruction. (e.g.
inspect carefully if the filter is clean and then open the valve)
optional sequence conditional expression, imper-
ative linear sequence. (e.g. ifyou prefer a stronger flavor,
add curry powder and cream.)
alternative sequence (conditional expression),
(argument) imperative linear sequence, (alternative-
opposition mark) instseq / (conditional expression,
instseq)+. (e.g. if you can locate the COM1 port, then ...
otherwise, or if you wish to be more cautious or cannot
locate it, dismount ....).
imperative co-temporal sequence imperative
linear sequence co-temporal mark, imperative
co-temporal sequence / instruction.
A co-temporal sequence relates instructions which must be
realized at the same time.
Finally, Instruction is the lower level and has the following
structure, with recursion on objective:
instruction (iterative expression), action, (ref-
erence)+, (goal)+, (manner)+, (motivation), (limit),
(picture)+, (warning) / objective.
Instructions can be complex since they may contain their own
goals, warnings and pictures. If an instruction is complex it
is analyzed as an objective.
As an illustration, the annotation of an alternative sequence
which is analysed as ”embedded conditions” is given, page 4.

3.1 Rhetorical structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997614039215686">
Rhetorical structures play several roles in our approach. They
first give a semantics to the discursive structure syntax given
above. They also contribute to enhancing the production of
well-designed responses [12]. They are also useful, as shall
be seen below, to allow for the integration of procedural texts
dealing with similar objectives or goals, but this is an ex-
tremely difficult task. Finally, they are used to answer ques-
tions with a higher accuracy by clearly identifying e.g. in-
struments (for the instrumental how), risks (via the warnings)
and equipment needed (via the prerequisites).
The RST [15] is a descriptive theory that specifies 23 pos-
sible relations showing how two portions of a text are linked.
Previous work on procedural texts [12], [20], [19], used lim-
ited RST relations and suggested additional relations that fit
procedural texts, which we use for our own analysis (limit, al-
ternative, concurrence). We identified 16 rhetorical relations
among which we introduced 6 new relations from our corpora
analysis:
Option: is considered when an action depends on the
existence of a conditional situation. Note that this rela-
tion can also link two sequential actions, where one is
compulsory and the other depends on the subject will or
on the situation itself (steam the fish for 10 minutes and
put it 5 minutes in the oven ifyou want it to turn brown).
Reference: holds between an action and a segment
which provides the localisation (in the text or in related
texts via hyperlink) of the detailed procedure, (remove
the reductor (seepage 18)); This relation occurs also be-
tween the summary (which contains the subgoals of the
global objective) and the related instruction sequences.
Prevention: is usually a relation between an action and
its warnings. Satellites include expressions such as: be
careful not to ..., and ’don’t’ expressions (cut the wood
planks, don’t draw any line!).
Prerequisites: occur between an action or an objective
and a list of of entities and instruments or a set of ac-
tions without which the action or the objective cannot be
realized (changing a car wheel : to change a wheel is
not difficult, with the proviso of having in one’s car the
good tools: wheel brace, jack, clean rag, torch (ifdark),
warning triangle).
Concurrence: occurs between two rival co-temporal ac-
tions (to choose the best computer, run the program A on
Mac, at the same time run the program B on PC. IfMac
detects the component before the PC, then use Mac, oth-
erwise use PC).
Development: allows for the identification of the pro-
cedure and sub-procedures in a text. It usually links the
titles or the goals to the instruction sequences.
The chart below summarizes, for the rhetorical relations
we use, the elements in our grammar which are involved.

4 Argumentation in procedural texts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998934">
Argumentation is found in the expression of procedural text
objectives, in the expression of disjunction, alternatives,
warnings, and within instructions.
Let us review here the four major forms of arguments we
frequently found in corpora. We outline here the main con-
ceptual and syntactic structures that characterize each of these
forms. Verb classes referred to are in general those specified
in WordNet [10]:
</bodyText>

quence

<bodyText confidence="0.849865066666666">
’Objective or goal’ arguments: are the most usual
ones. They usually introduce a set of instructions or
more locally an instruction. Their target is the ”goal”
symbol of the grammar. They basically introduce
causality between a goal and the set of instructions that
realize it. The abstract schemas are the following: (1)
purpose connector-infinitive verb, (2) causal connector-
deverbal and (3) titles.
– purpose connectors: pour, afin de, etc. (to, in order
to) (e.g. to remove the bearings, for lubrifzcation of
the universaljoint shafts).
– titles : infinitive verbs or deverbals (e.g. engine dis-
mount).
Prevention arguments: embedded either in a ’positive’
or a ’negative’ formulation. Their role is basically to ex-
plain and to justify. Negative formulation is easy to iden-
tify: there are prototypical expressions that introduce the
arguments. Negative formulation follows the abstract
schemas : (1) negative causal connector-infinitive risk
verbs; (2) causal connector-modal +VP(negative polar-
ity, infinitive); (3) negative causal mark-risk verb class
VP; (4) causal connector-VP(with negation); (5) causal
connector-prevention verb.
– negative causal connectors: sous peine de, sinon,
car sinon, sans quoi, etc. (otherwise, under the risk
of) (e.g. sous peine d’attaquer la teinte du bois).
– risk verb class: risquer, causer, nuire, commettre
etc. (e.g. pour ne pas commettre d’erreur).
– prevention verbs: ´eviter, pr´evenir, etc. (e.g. afzn
d’´eviter que la carte se d´echausse lorsqu’on la
visse au chˆassis, gloss: in order to prevent the card
from skipping off its rack).
– causal connector and negation: de facon a` ne pas,
pour ne pas, pour que ... ne ...pas etc. (in order not
to) (e.g. pour ne pas le rendre brillant, gloss: in
order not to make it too bright).
– modal VP: pouvoir, pouvoir-ˆetre (e.g. car il peut
ˆetre us´e pr´ematur´ement par la d´efaillance d’un
autre, gloss: because it may be prematurely worn
due to the failure of another component).
Positive formulation marks are the same as for the first
category of arguments described above. We have the
following abstract schemas: (1) purpose mark-infinitive
verb; (2) causal subordination mark-subordinate propo-
sition, (3) causal mark-proposition:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.840622333333333">
– purpose marks: afin de, pour (so as to, for).
– causal marks: car, c’est pourquoi etc. (e.g. car
ceux-ci sont les plus d´elicats).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.909456538461539">
– causal subordination marks: afin que, pour que, etc.
(so that, for).
– the verbs encountered are usually of conservative
type : conserver, maintenir, etc.
To discriminate arguments using purpose marks from
those of the first class, we can use a reformulation crite-
rion. Positive prevention arguments can be reformulated
to a negative form using negative causal connectors or
verbal inferences (e.g. afzn que la semence adh`ere bien
au sol car sinon la semence n’adh`erera pas au sol
(gloss: in order for the crop to adhere to the ground /
otherwise the crop will not adhere to the ground)).
Performing arguments: These arguments are less
imperative than the others, they are rather advices,
evaluations. The corresponding abstract schemas
are: (1) causal connector-performing NP; (2) causal
connector-performing verb; (3) causal connector-modal-
performing verb; (4) performing proposition.
– performing verbs: e.g. permettre, am´eliorer, etc.
(allow, improve).
– performing NP: e.g. Pour une meilleure fznition;
pour des raisons de performances.
– performing proposition: e.g. Have small bills. It’s
easier to tip and to pay your fare that way.
Threatening arguments: These arguments have a
strong impact on the user’s intention to realize the in-
struction provided, the instruction is made compulsory
by using this kind of argument. This is the injuctive
form. It follows the following schema: (1) otherwise
connector-consequence proposition; (2) otherwise nega-
tive expression-consequence proposition
– otherwise connectors: sinon.
– otherwise negative expression: si ... ne ...pas... (e.g.
si vous ne le faites pas, nous le p´erimerons automa-
tiquement apr`es trois semaines en ligne, if you do
not do it, we will revoke it immediately).
Besides these four main types of arguments, we found
some forms of stimulation-evaluation (what you only have
to do now...), and evaluation.

5 Injunctive forms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998916511627907">
Let us now say a few words about interesting syntactic and
morphological characteristics. First, we found no sign of au-
thor positioning: there is no use of personal pronoun like ’I’
or ’We’. However, the author’s enunciation is made visible in
French by the use of imperative and infinitive verbal forms.
The most important form is certainly the injunctive discourse.
It characterizes certain modalities of discourse: orders, pre-
ventions, warnings, avoidances, advices. These all have a
strong volitive and deontic dimension.
Injunctive discourse shows how the author of an procedural
text imposes his point of view to the user. The goal is that
the user knows how to execute it in a way as explicit and
less ambiguous as possible. The user is assumed to have the
required competences to realize it.
Procedural texts are an example of a logic of action. In-
junction is particularly frequent in cooking receipes, security
notices, etc. Its strength is measured via the illocutionary
force of the statement. In general we observed that infini-
tive or imperative modes are used in French. Some examples
of injunction forms are given below, from which we could
construct dedicated NLG templates:
infinitive: Mettre la poudre dans le verre (put the powder
in the glass).
imperative: Enlevez la bague sup´erieure du bol
d’articulation a` l’aide d’un burin (gloss: remove upper
bushing from socket using a chisel).
modal verbs: Vous devez enduire la face int´erieure du
pivot de pˆate d’´etanch´eit´e SILICOMET (gloss: you must
coat internal face of pivot with SILICOMET sealing
compound).
preference expresssion : ”il est conseill´e de ...”, ”nous
vous recommandons de ...”, ”il est pr´ef´erable de ...” (it
is advised to, we recommend that).
negative infinitive form: Ne pas utiliser de facon pro-
long´ee sans avis m´edical do not use on the long term
without medical advice.
In everyday life, we encounter many injunctions posted in
public areas. In French, these injunctions follow in general
these regular structural schemas:
deverbal-infinitive (e.g. d´efense d’afficher (gloss: stick
no bills).
courtesy formula-negative infinitive (e.g. pri`ere de ne
pas fumer (gloss: no smoking (please)).

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969">
In this paper, we briefly shown the variety of structures, ra-
tional and somewhat irrational that organize procedural texts.
We conducted this research with the main goal of generating
responses in a cooperative way to and ques-
tions. The long-term goals are to select the best text w.r.t. a
user profile, and then to be able to integrate texts on the same
topic to get a better text.
This preliminary step is now stabilized, and we designed
an annotation tool, based on the grammar and related marks,
to implement and evaluate our results. However, to get a
more accurate view of the diversity of argumentation in this
type of text, we need to also consider more subtle language
forms such as: modalisators, tonality, opinion marks, evalua-
tion marks, illocutionary force in injunctions, etc.

<abstract confidence="0.999331833333333">Instructional texts consist of sequences of instructions designed in order to reach an objective. The author or the generator of instructional texts must follow a number of principles to guarantee that the text is of any use. Similarly, a user must follow step by step the instructions in order to reach the results expected. In this paper, we explore facets of instructional texts: general prototypical structures, rhetorical structure and natural argumentation. Our study is based on an extensive corpus study with the aim of generating such texts.</abstract>

There is obviously a big contrast between maintenance manuals and people magazines which both contains such texts. Procedural texts can be regulatory, procedural, programmatory, prescriptive, injunctive, or may introduce advices (for social of psychological behavior) [1]. The study we present in this paper has three main goals: First, to be able to accurately respond in natural language to (procedural) questions. Procedural question answering systems are much of interest both to large public via the web, and to more technical staff for example to query large textual databases dedicated to various types of procedures [6].

We briefly survey various approaches here, outlining elements of interest for our objectives. Under the heading of procedural texts, there is a quite large diversity of texts. J.M. Adam [1] notices the variability of judgments in procedural text categorization. Texts can, for example, be grouped into families according to their main objectives and style. We have, for example: regulatory texts [16] that characterize expected behaviours, procedural texts [13] defined as rather liear sets of instructions, ’programmatory’ texts [11] which include receipes, musical scores and architectory plan, identifie how knowledge from an expert is transferred via these texts to users who are expected to follow strictly the instructions which are given. instructional-prescriptive texts [21], wher</context>

We believe that besides language realization variants, most of the characteristics we present here are language neutral. This study is based on an extensive corpus study, within a language production perspective. This approach allows us to integrate logical, linguistic (e.g. [17], [5]) and philosophical views of argumentation. In this paper we first introduce some elements of a general typology of procedural texts, outlining the number of components, rational and irrational, that compose them. We then give the most important structural elements, and the rhetorical structure that characterizes the relations between elements.

This is particularly visible in the lexical choices made and in the choice of some constructions, including typographic; procedural discourse is basically interactive: it communicates, teaches, justifies, explains, warns, forbids, stimulates, evaluates. Let us finally note a few NLG-oriented papers centered on the generation of arguments such as [22], which focus on generic types of arguments (ad absurdum, from cases, etc.) and [8]. 3 A Discursive analysis of procedural texts The complexity of procedural texts leads us to proceed very gradually in the study of their structure before being able to produce even simple such texts. At an intermediate level, responding in natural language to questions, using underspecified templates is an interesting step which can be evaluated. We collected a corpus of procedural texts from which we extracted the main structure via the design of a grammar. The corpus contains several types of procedural texts: receipes, maintenance manuals, medical notices, assembly, advice texts, etc. The </context>

Finally a second corpus was gathered to conduct a manual evaluation of the grammar. An annotation tool based on the grammar and on related marks has been developped in order to automatically evaluate on larger samples. The structures reported below essentially correspond to (1) the organization of the informational contents: how tasks are planned, according to goals and subgoals, and (2) to the argumentative strategies used (planning, progression of tasks, warnings, advices, evaluations, etc.). General principles of argumentative discourse are given e.g. in [9]. In what follows, parentheses express optionality, + iteration, the comma is just a separator with no temporal connotation a priori, / is an or and the operator indicates a preferred precedence. Each symbol corresponds to an XML-tag, allowing us to annotate procedural texts,. The top node is termed objective: objective title, (summary), (warning)+, (prerequisites), (picture)+ instruction sequences. summary title+ Summary describes the global organization of the procedure, it may be useful when procedures are complex (summary can be a set of hyper-links, often pointing to titles). warning text</context>

We briefly survey various approaches here, outlining elements of interest for our objectives. Under the heading of procedural texts, there is a quite large diversity of texts. J.M. Adam [1] notices the variability of judgments in procedural text categorization. Texts can, for example, be grouped into families according to their main objectives and style. We have, for example: regulatory texts [16] that characterize expected behaviours, procedural texts [13] defined as rather liear sets of instructions, ’programmatory’ texts [11] which include receipes, musical scores and architectory plan, identifie how knowledge from an expert is transferred via these texts to users who are expected to follow strictly the instructions which are given. instructional-prescriptive texts [21], where a quite detailed analysis of temporal and event structures is carried out, injunctive texts, where [2] show the form and style used in short notices that relate e.g. fire instructions, security measures, etc.,</context>

This paper basically relates the structure ofprocedural texts as they are in French. English translations of examples are just glosses, they are given when space constraints permit. We believe that besides language realization variants, most of the characteristics we present here are language neutral. This study is based on an extensive corpus study, within a language production perspective. This approach allows us to integrate logical, linguistic (e.g. [17], [5]) and philosophical views of argumentation. In this paper we first introduce some elements of a general typology of procedural texts, outlining the number of components, rational and irrational, that compose them. We then give the most important structural elements, and the rhetorical structure that characterizes the relations between elements. Finally, we focus on argumentation, a major dimension of procedural texts and we briefly present the forms of arguments which are the most important, and under what constraints they can be generated. 2 State of the art 2.1 General typology Procedur</context>

This is particularly visible in the lexical choices made and in the choice of some constructions, including typographic; procedural discourse is basically interactive: it communicates, teaches, justifies, explains, warns, forbids, stimulates, evaluates. Let us finally note a few NLG-oriented papers centered on the generation of arguments such as [22], which focus on generic types of arguments (ad absurdum, from cases, etc.) and [8]. 3 A Discursive analysis of procedural texts The complexity of procedural texts leads us to proceed very gradually in the study of their structure before being able to produce even simple such texts. At an intermediate level, responding in natural language to questions, using underspecified templates is an interesting step which can be evaluated. We collected a corpus of procedural texts from which we extracted the main structure via the design of a grammar. The corpus contains several types of procedural texts</context>
