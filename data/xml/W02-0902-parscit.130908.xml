This paper presents work on the task
of constructing a word-level translation
lexicon purely from unrelated mono-
lingual corpora. We combine vari-
ous clues such as cognates, similar
context, preservation of word similar-
ity, and word frequency. Experimen-
tal results for the construction of a
German-English noun lexicon are re-
ported. Noun translation accuracy of
39% scored against a parallel test cor-
pus could be achieved.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938442307692">
Recently, there has been a surge in research
in machine translation that is based on em-
pirical methods. The seminal work by Brown
et al. [1990] at IBM on the Candide system laid
the foundation for much of the current work
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
Some of this work has been re-implemented
and is freely available for research purposes [Al-
Onaizan et al., 1999].
Roughly speaking, SMT divides the task of
translation into two steps: a word-level trans-
lation model and a model for word reordering
during the translation process.
The statistical models are trained on parallel
corpora: large amounts of text in one language
along with their translation in another. Var-
ious parallel texts have recently become avail-
able, mostly from government sources such as
parliament proceedings (the Canadian Hansard,
the minutes of the European parliament1) or law
texts (from Hong Kong).
Still, for most language pairs, parallel texts
are hard to come by. This is clearly the case for
low-density languages such as Tamil, Swahili, or
Tetun. Furthermore, texts derived from parlia-
ment speeches may not be appropriate for a par-
ticular targeted domain. Specific parallel texts
can be constructed by hand for the purpose of
training an SMT system, but this is a very costly
endeavor.
On the other hand, the digital revolution and
the wide-spread use of the World Wide Web
have proliferated vast amounts of monolingual
corpora. Publishing text in one language is a
much more natural human activity than produc-
ing parallel texts. To illustrate this point: The
world wide web alone contains currently over
two billion pages, a number that is still grow-
ing exponentially. According to Google,2 the
word directory occurs 61 million times, empathy
383,000 times, and reflex 787,000 times. In the
Hansard, each of these words occurs only once.
The objective of this research to build a trans-
lation lexicon solely from monolingual corpora.
Specifically, we want to automatically generate
a one-to-one mapping of German and English
nouns. We are testing our mappings against
a bilingual lexicon of 9,206 German and 10,645
English nouns.
The two monolingual corpora should be in a
fairly comparable domain. For our experiments
we use the 1990-1992 Wall Street Journal corpus

on the English side and the 1995-1996 German
news wire (DPA) corpus on the German side.
Both corpora are news sources in the general
sense. However, they span different time peri-
ods and have a different orientation: the World
Street Journal covers mostly business news, the
German news wire mostly German politics.
For experiments on training probabilistic
translation lexicons from parallel corpora and
similar tasks on the same test corpus, refer to

2 Clues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991">
This section will describe clues that enable us to
find translations of words of the two monolingual
corpora. We will examine each clue separately.
The following clues are considered:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961469695652174">
• Identical words – Two languages contain
a certain number of identical words, such as
computer or email.
• Similar Spelling – Some words may have
very similarly written translations due to
common language roots (e.g. Freund and
friend) or adopted words (e.g. Webseite and
website).
• Context – Words that occur in a certain
context window in one language have trans-
lations that are likely to occur in a similar
context window in the other language (e.g.
Wirtschaft co-occurs frequently with Wach-
stum, as economy does with growth).
• Similarity – Words that are used simi-
larly in one language should have transla-
tions that are also similar (e.g. Wednesday
is similar to Thursday as Mittwoch is similar
to Donnerstag).
• Frequency – For comparable corpora, fre-
quent words in one corpus should have
translations that are frequent in the other
corpus (e.g. for news corpora, government is

more frequent than flower, as its translation
Regierung is more frequent than Blume.
We will now look in detail how these clues
may contribute to building a German-English
translation lexicon.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.866322">
2.1 Identical words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997468">
Due to cultural exchange, a large number of
words that originate in one language are adopted
by others. Recently, this phenomenon can be
seen with words such as Internet, or Aids.
These terms may be adopted verbatim, or
changed by well-established rules. For instance,
immigration (German and English) has the Por-
tuguese translation immigra¸c˜ao, as many words
ending in -tion have translations with the same
spelling except for the ending changed to -¸c˜ao.
We examined the German words in our lex-
icon and tried to find English words that have
the exact same spelling. Surprisingly, we could
count a total of 976 such words. When check-
ing them against a benchmark lexicon, we found
these mappings to be 88% correct.
The correctness of word mappings acquired
in this fashion depends highly on word length.
This is illustrated in Table 1: While identical 3-
letter words are only translations of each other
60% of the time, this is true for 98% of 10-letter
words. Clearly, for shorter words, the acciden-
tal existence of an identically spelled word in
the other language word is much higher. This
includes words such as fee, ton, art, and tag.

Table 1: Testing the assumption that identically

<bodyText confidence="0.978577652173913">
spelled words are in fact translations of each
other: The accuracy of this assumption depends
highly on the length of the words (see Section
2.1)
Knowing this allows us to restrict the word
length to be able to increase the accuracy of the
collected word pairs. For instance, by relying
only on words at least of length 6, we could col-
lect 622 word pairs with 96% accuracy. In our
experiments, however, we included all the words
pairs.
As already mentioned, there are some well-
established transformation rules for the adop-
tion of words from a foreign language. For Ger-
man to English, this includes replacing the let-
ters k and z by c and changing the ending -t¨at
by -ty. Both these rules can be observed in the
word pair Elektrizit¨at and electricity.
By using these two rules, we can gather 363
additional word pairs of which 330, or 91%, are
in fact translations of each other. The combined
total of 1339 (976+363) word pairs are separated
and form the seed for some of the following steps.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997381">
2.2 Similar Spelling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707166666667">
When words are adopted into another language,
their spelling might change slightly in a manner
that can not be simply generalized in a rule. Ob-
serve, for instance website and Webseite. This is
even more the case for words that can be traced
back to common language roots, such as friend
and Freund, or president and Pr¨asident.
Still, these words – often called cognates –
maintain a very similar spelling. This can be
defined as differing in very few letters. This
measurement can be formalized as the number
of letters common in sequence between the two
words, divided by the length of the longer word.
The example word pair friend and freund
shares 5 letters (fr-e-nd), and both words have
length 6, hence there spelling similarity is 5/6, or
0.83. This measurement is called longest com-
mon subsequence ratio [Melamed, 1995]. In
related work, string edit distance (or, Lev-
enshtein distance) has been used [Mann and
Yarowski, 2001].
With this computational means at hand, we
can now measure the spelling similarity between
every German and English word, and sort pos-
sible word pairs accordingly. By going through
this list starting at the top we can collect new
word pairs. We do this is in a greedy fashion –
once a word is assigned to a word pair, we do
not look for another match. Table 2 gives the
top 24 generated word pairs by this algorithm.

ing words with most similar spelling in a greedy
fashion.
The applied measurement of spelling similar-
ity does not take into account that certain letter
changes (such as z to s, or dropping of the fi-
nal e) are less harmful than others. Tiedemann
[1999] explores the automatic construction of a
string similarity measure that learns which let-
ter changes occur more likely between cognates
of two languages. This measure is trained, how-
ever, on parallel sentence-aligned text, which is
not available here.
Obviously, the vast majority of word pairs can
not be collected this way, since their spelling
shows no resemblance at all. For instance,
Spiegel and mirror share only one vowel, which
is rather accidental.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978445">
2.3 Similar Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986298630137">
If our monolingual corpora are comparable, we
can assume a word that occurs in a certain con-
text should have a translation that occurs in a
similar context.
Context, as we understand it here, is defined
by the frequencies of context words in surround-
ing positions. This local context has to be trans-
lated into the other language, and we can search
the word with the most similar context.
This idea has already been investigated in ear-
lier work. Rapp [1995, 1999] proposes to collect
counts over words occurring in a four word win-
dow around the target word. For each occur-
rence of a target word, counts are collected over
how often certain context words occur in the two
positions directly ahead of the target word and
the two following positions. The counts are col-
lected separately for each position and then en-
tered into in a context vector with an dimension
for each context word in each position. Finally,
the raw counts are normalized, so that for each
of the four word positions the vector values add
up to one. Vector comparison is done by adding
all absolute differences of all components.
Fung and Yee [1998] propose a similar ap-
proach: They count how often another word oc-
curs in the same sentence as the target word.
The counts are then normalized by a using the
tf/idf method which is often used in information
retrieval [Jones, 1979].
The need for translating the context poses a
chicken-and-egg problem: If we already have a
translation lexicon we can translate the context
vectors. But we can only construct a translation
lexicon with this approach if we are already able
to translate the context vectors.
Theoretically, it is possible to use these meth-
ods to build a translation lexicon from scratch
[Rapp, 1995]. The number of possible mappings
has complexity O(n!), and the computing cost of
each mapping has quadratic complexity O(n2).
For a large number of words n – at least more
than 10,000, maybe more than 100,000 – the
combined complexity becomes prohibitively ex-
pensive.
Because of this, both Rapp and Fung focus on
expanding an existing large lexicon to add a few
novel terms.
Clearly, a seed lexicon to bootstrap these
methods is needed. Fortunately, we have out-
lined in Section 2.1 how such a seed lexicon can
be obtained: by finding words spelled identically
in both languages.
We can then construct context vectors that
contain information about how a new unmapped
word co-occurs with the seed words. This vec-
tor can be translated into the other language,
since we already know the translations of the
seed words.
Finally, we can look for the best matching
context vector in the target language, and de-
cide upon the corresponding word to construct
a word mapping.
Again, as in Section 2.2, we have to com-
pute all possible word – or context vector –
matches. We collect then the best word matches
in a greedy fashion. Table 3 displays the top 15
generated word pairs by this algorithm. The
context vectors are constructed in the way pro-
posed by Rapp [1999], with the difference that
we collect counts over a four noun window, not a
four word window, by dropping all intermediate
words.

2.4 Preserving Word Similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999754441176471">
Intuitively it is obvious that pairs of words that
are similar in one language should have trans-
lations that are similar in the other language.
For instance, Wednesday is similar to Thursday
as Mittwoch is similar to Donnerstag. Or: dog is
similar to cat in English, as Hund is similar to
Katze in German.
The challenge is now to come up with a quan-
tifiable measurement of word similarity. One
strategy is to define two words as similar if they
occur in a similar context. Clearly, this is the
case for Wednesday and Thursday, as well as for
dog and cat.
Exactly this similarity measurement is used
in the work by Diab and Finch [2000]. Their
approach to constructing and comparing con-
text vectors differs significantly from methods
discussed in the previous section.
For each word in the lexicon, the context vec-
tor consists of co-occurrence counts in respect to
150 so-called peripheral tokens, basically the
most frequent words. These counts are collected
for each position in a 4-word window around the
word in focus. This results in a 600-dimensional
vector.
Instead of comparing these co-occurrence
counts directly, the Spearman rank order
correlation is applied: For each position the
tokens are compared in frequency and the fre-
quency count is replaced by the frequency rank
– the most frequent token count is replaced by
1, the least frequent by n = 150. The similarity
of two context vectors a = (ai) and b = (bi) is
then defined by:3

<equation confidence="0.9346125">
Rab = 1 − 6 E(ai−bi)2
(,) 4n(n2−1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998994259259259">
The result of all this is a matrix with similar-
ity scores between all German words, and second
one with similarity scores between all English
words. Such matrices could also be constructed
using the definitions of context we reviewed in
the previous section. The important point here
is that we have generated a similarity matrix,
which we will use now to find new translation
word pairs.
Again, as in the previous Section 2.3, we as-
3In the given formula we fixed two mistakes of the
original presentation [Diab and Finch, 2000]: The square
of the differences is used, and the denominator contains
the additional factor 4, since essentially 4 150-word vec-
tors are compared.
sume that we will already have a seed lexicon.
For a new word we can look up its similarity
scores to the seed words, thus creating a simi-
larity vector. Such a vector can be translated
into the other language – recall that dimensions
of the vector are the similarity scores to seed
words, for which we already have translations.
The translated vector can be compared to other
vectors in the second language.
As before, we search greedily for the best
matching similarity vectors and add the corre-
sponding words to the lexicon.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984044">
2.5 Word Frequency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975153846154">
Finally, another simple clue is the observation
that in comparable corpora, the same concepts
should be used with similar frequencies. Even if
the most frequent word in the German corpus is
not necessarily the translation of the most fre-
quent English word, it should also be very fre-
quent.
Table 4 illustrates the situation with our cor-
pora. It contains the top 10 German and En-
glish words, together with the frequency ranks
of their best translations. For both languages, 4
of the 10 words have translations that also rank
in the top 10.
Clearly, simply aligning the nth frequent Ger-
man word with the nth frequent English word is
not a viable strategy. In our case, this is addi-
tionally hampered by the different orientation of
the news sources. The frequent financial terms
in the English WSJ corpus (stock, bank, sales,
etc.) are rather rare in the German corpus.
For most words, especially for more compara-
ble corpora, there is a considerable correlation
between the frequency of a word and its transla-
tion. Our frequency measurement is defined as
ratio of the word frequencies, normalized by the
corpus sizes.

3.1 Evaluation measurements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919772727273">
We are trying to build a one-to-one German-
English translation lexicon for the use in a ma-
chine translation system.
To evaluate this performance we use two dif-
ferent measurements: Firstly, we record how
many correct word-pairs we have constructed.
This is done by checking the generated word-
pairs against an existing bilingual lexicon.4 In
essence, we try to recreate this lexicon, which
contains 9,206 distinct German and 10,645 dis-
tinct English nouns and 19,782 lexicon entries.
For a machine translation system, it is of-
ten more important to get more frequently used
words right than obscure ones. Thus, our second
evaluation measurement tests the word transla-
tions proposed by the acquired lexicon against
the actual word-level translations in a 5,000 sen-
tence aligned parallel corpus.5
The starting point to extending the lexicon
is the seed lexicon of identically spelled words,
as described in Section 2.1. It consists of 1339
entries, of which are (88.9%) correct according

to the existing bilingual lexicon. Due to com-
putational constraints,6 we focus on the addi-
tional mapping of only 1,000 German and En-
glish words.
These 1,000 words are chosen from the 1,000
most frequent lexicon entries in the dictionary,
without duplications of words. This frequency
is defined by the sum of two word frequencies of
the words in the entry, as found in the mono-
lingual corpora. We did not collect statistics of
the actual use of lexical entries in, say, a parallel
corpus.
In a different experimental set-up we also sim-
ply tried to match the 1,000 most frequent Ger-
man words with the 1,000 most frequent English
words. The results do not differ significantly.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998677">
3.2 Greedy extension
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922958333333">
Each of the four clues described in the Sections
2.2 to 2.5 provide a matching score between a
German and an English word. The likelihood
of these two words being actual translations of
each other should correlate to these scores.
There are many ways one could search for the
best set of lexicon entries based on these scores.
We could perform an exhaustive search: con-
struct all possible mappings and find the high-
est combined score of all entries. Since there are
O(n!) possible mappings, a brute force approach
to this is practically impossible.
We therefore employed a greedy search: First
we search for the highest score for any word pair.
We add this word pair to the lexicon, and drop
word pairs that include either the German and
English word from further search. Again, we
search for the highest score and add the corre-
sponding word pair, drop these words from fur-
ther search, and so on. This is done iteratively,
until all words are used up.
Tables 2 and 3 illustrate this process for the
spelling and context similarity clues, when ap-
plied separately.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.855770666666667">
6For matching 1,000 words, the described algorithms
run up to 3 days. Since the complexity of these algo-
rithms is O(n2) in regard to the number of words, a full
run on 10,000 would take almost a year. Of course, this
may be alleviated by more efficient implementation and
parallelization.

The results are summarized in Table 5. Recall
that for each word that we are trying to map to
the other language, a thousand possible target
words exist, but only one is correct. The base-
line for this task, choosing words at random, re-
sults on average in only 1 correct mapping in
the entire lexicon. A perfect lexicon, of course,
contains 1000 correct entries.
The starting point for the corpus score is
the 15.8% that are already achieved with the
seed lexicon from Section 2.1. In an experiment
where we identified the best lexical entries using
a very large parallel corpus, we could achieve
89% accuracy on this test corpus.

Taken alone, both the context and spelling

search to the correct translations.

reveals that while the spelling clue allows to
learn more correct lexicon entries (140 opposed
to 107), the context clue does better with the
more frequently used lexicon entries, as found
in the test corpus (accuracy of 31.9% opposed
to 25.4%).

3.4 Combining Clues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999785">
Combining different clues is quite simple: We
can simply add up the matching scores. The
scores can be weighted. Initially we simply
weighted all clues equally. We then changed the
weights to see, if we can obtain better results.
We found that there is generally a broad range
of weights that result in similar performance.
When using the spelling clue in combination
with others, we found it useful to define a cutoff.
If two words agree in 30% of their letters this
is generally as bad as if they do not agree in
any – the agreements are purely coincidental.
Therefore we counted all spelling scores below
0.3 as 0.3.
Combining the context and the spelling clues
yields a significantly better result than using
each clue by itself. A total of 185 correct lexical
entries are learned with a corpus score of 38.6%.
Adding in the other scores, however, does not
seem to be beneficial: only adding the frequency
clue to the spelling clue provides some improve-
ment. In all other cases, these scores are not
helpful.
Besides this linear combination of scores from
the different clues, more sophisticated methods
may be possible [Koehn, 2002].

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984904761905">
We have attempted to learn a one-to-one trans-
lation lexicon purely from unrelated monolin-
gual corpora. Using identically spelled words
proved to be a good starting point. Beyond this,
we examined four different clues. Two of them,
matching similar spelled words and words with
the same context, helped us to learn a significant
number of additional correct lexical entries.
Our experiments have been restricted to
nouns. Verbs, adjectives, adverbs and other part
of speech may be tackled in a similar way. They
might also provide useful context information
that is beneficial to building a noun lexicon.
These methods may be also useful given a
different starting point: For efforts in building
machine translation systems, some small paral-
lel text should be available. From these, some
high-quality lexical entries can be learned, but
there will always be many words that are miss-
ing. These may be learned using the described
methods.

The counts are collected separately for each position and then entered into in a context vector with an dimension for each context word in each position. Finally, the raw counts are normalized, so that for each of the four word positions the vector values add up to one. Vector comparison is done by adding all absolute differences of all components. Fung and Yee [1998] propose a similar approach: They count how often another word occurs in the same sentence as the target word. The counts are then normalized by a using the tf/idf method which is often used in information retrieval [Jones, 1979]. The need for translating the context poses a chicken-and-egg problem: If we already have a translation lexicon we can translate the context vectors. But we can only construct a translation lexicon with this approach if we are already able to translate the context vectors. Theoretically, it is possible to use these methods to build a translation lexicon from scratch [Rapp, 1995].

Both corpora are news sources in the general sense. However, they span different time periods and have a different orientation: the World Street Journal covers mostly business news, the German news wire mostly German politics. For experiments on training probabilistic translation lexicons from parallel corpora and similar tasks on the same test corpus, refer to our earlier work [Koehn and Knight, 2000, 2001]. 2 Clues This section will describe clues that enable us to find translations of words of the two monolingual corpora. We will examine each clue separately. The following clues are considered: • Identical words – Two languages contain a certain number of identical words, such as computer or email. • Similar Spelling – Some words may have very similarly written translations due to common language roots (e.g. Freund and friend) or adopted words (e.g. Webseite and website). • Context – Words that occur in a certain context window in one language have translations that are likely to occur </context>
