Temporal information analysis is very
important for Chinese Information Process.
Comparing with English, Chinese is quite
different in temporal information
expression. Based on the feature of Chinese
a phase-based method is proposed to deal
with Chinese temporal information. To this
end, an algorithm is put forward to classify
verbs into different situation types
automatically. About 2981 verbs were
tested. The result has shown that the
algorithm is effective.

<bodyText confidence="0.999792125">
We are now launching a research
project on Events Extraction from Chinese
Financial News, which requires us to extract
the related temporal information from news.
Temporal expressions in Chinese form a
complex system. We cannot fully
understand the temporal information only by
extracting the verbs, adverbs, auxiliary
words and temporal phrases. Instead, more
profound analysis is needed. In this paper,
we first introduce the temporal system of
Chinese, then we put forward a method in
dealing with Chinese temporal information,
in which situation types is very important.
Therefore, an algorithm is rendered to
classify verbs into several situation types.

1.1 Temporal System of Chinese
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999597428571428">
Commonly, Chinese linguists [3114]
think that the temporal system of Chinese
includes three parts: phase, tense and aspect.
Each of these represents some profile of
temporal expression (these definitions are a
little different from linguistic theory of
English).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94678575">
(1) Phase. A sentence may describe a static
state or an action; an action may be durative
or instantaneous; a durative action may
indicate a terminal or not. All of these are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.937898761904762">
the research fields of phase. So, static vs.
dynamic, durative vs. instantaneous, telic vs.
non-telic are three pairs of phase features.
Phase depends fully on meaning. According
to phase features, we can classify the verbs
into different situation types.
(2) Tense. Tense describes the relations
between an event (E), reference time (R) and
speaking time (S). First, taking S as the
origin, we can get three relations between R
and S: if R is before S, the sentence
describes past; if R is the same time as S. it
describes present; if R is after S, it describes
future. This is called primary tense.
Secondly, we can get three relations
between E and S: If E is before R, we call it
anterior; if E is the same time as R, we call it
simple; otherwise we call it posterior. This is
called secondary tense. Therefore, there are
nine tenses including anterior past, anterior
future, simple future, posterior present, etc.

<listItem confidence="0.8396465">
(3) Aspect . Aspect reflects the way we
observe an event. For the same event, there
are many perspectives. We can take the
event as atomic and not consider its inner
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996002833333333">
structure, and call it perfective. We can
consider it being in process, and call it
imperfective. For imperfective, we can
observe it at a position before it, at the
beginning of it, in the middle of it, etc.
Different perspectives lead to different
expressions in the language.
Phase, tense and aspect are not
independent even though they are different
conceptions; each of them can influence and
restrict the others, ultimately building up the
complex temporal system of Chinese.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.7378445">
1.2 Phase-based Chinese temporal
information analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998371875">
Most languages express temporal
information through phase, tense and aspect,
however, for different languages, the
relative importance of the three parts is
different. A very important feature of
English is that tense and aspect are
expressed by variation of predicates. But for
Chinese, predicates keep the same form no
matter how the tense and aspect are
different.
Therefore, in English, temporal
information analysis mainly considers tense
and aspect, as well as temporal adjective and
time words and phrases. But in Chinese,
tense and aspect of a sentence are not very
clear, verbs do not vary in form with the
change of tense and aspect. So we suggest
basing temporal information analysis on
phase. We mainly perceive the situation type
of a sentence, then roughly acquire tense
from adverbs and auxiliary words. After
considering the temporal phrases, we can
understand the temporal information of
single event fully. Finally, according to the
absolute temporal information of single
event, we can get the temporal relation
between two events. Phase-based temporal
information analysis has been used in our
research on Event Extraction from Financial
News, in which the most important and
fundamental problem is to acquire the
situation types of a sentence.

1.3 Situation Classification of Chinese
Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999353714285714">
In the West, research on situation has a
long history. The earliest can be traced to
the times of Aristotle. In resent years,
Western researchers have published a large
volume of papers, which present many
points of view. The most important are
Vendler(1967), Bache(1982), and Smith
(1985) . They approximately classify the
situation as four types:
state, activity, accomplishment, and
achievement.
Chinese researchers have also done
considerable work, among which the most
typical research were done by Chen[3] and
Ma[5].
Ma[5] stated that the situation of a
sentence is fully determined by the situation
of the main verb of the sentence. He use
three phases: static, durative, telic to classify
verbs into four situational types
V1,V2,V3,V4.

<bodyText confidence="0.992388">
Chen[3] stated that the situation of a
sentence not only depends on the main verb
of the sentence but also on other parts of the
sentence. That is, although the main verb is
the most important in determining a
sentence situation, other parts such as
adverbs also have effect. Cheri s
classification is more detailed.

2. Our Classification Algorithm for

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988738">
2.1 Guiding Thoughts
</subsectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.9934196">
(1) Our algorithm is for information
processing
•Ma[5] uses three pairs of phase features in
classifying, but from which we can not get
an automatic classification algorithm for
computers; the classification can only be
done manually.
•In linguistics, telicity is a phase feature
used in classifying. In table 1.1 the
difference between category V2 and V3, in
table 1.3, the difference between &amp;quot;activitf
and &amp;quot;accomplishment&apos; , are attributed to
telicity. But in information process, we need
not distinguish whether an event is telic or
not. For example,
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.826385">
Exp.1
fthalYAM. (He is playing the flute)
flialX &apos;We . (He is playing a song &amp;quot;Liangzhu&amp;quot; )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99836112">
Chen[3] thinks that in Exp. 1, the first
sentence has the features: dynamicity, and
durativity, and non-telicity; it belongs
to &amp;quot;activity&apos; . The second sentence has the
features dynamicity, durativity, and telicity,
because in the second sentence, there is a
default terminal----when the song
liangzhif is over, the action &amp;quot;play&apos; is
over, so the sentence belongs to
&apos;accomplishment&apos; instead of &amp;quot;activit)P .
However we think such discrimination is
useless for information extraction, because
telicity is an ambiguous concept itself. What
we need is to acquire the exact duration of
the event. So if we knew the event is
durative or not, and got the temporal
phrases, we can know terminal time of the
event. Besides, whether an event is telic or
not can not be attributed to collocation and
only can be done manually(as the exp 1
shows). For these reasons, we consider the
two verbs in Exp. 1 belonging to the same
situational type, that is, we do not use
talicity as a phase feature to classifying
verbs.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991515">

<bodyText confidence="0.993602461538462">
(2) Separate classification of the verb
situation from classification of the sentence
situation.
Chen[3] points that some verbs belong
to more than one category, and gives a
method to distinguish these cases. To make
the ideal more clear, we use two steps to
complete the sentence situation recognition.
In this paper, we render an algorithm to
classify verbs into different categories,
which is the basis of another research--
recognition of sentence situation, which will
be discussed in future work.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993671">
2.2 Classification Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.78084175">
We classify the verbs into five categories ,
A tt(Attribute), Men (Mentality ), Act
(Activity) , Ins (Instantaneous) , Amb
(Ambiguous).
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.501995375">
Att: 4(be), 4T-(equal), t4(include),I&apos;S•(accord with)
Men: UK(like), A(love),
(be satisfied with)
Act: 1519(gab), lra(drink), Ilgt--(run)
In Pn(explore), M(extinguish), EK(snap),
(discovery)
Amb: 1(sit), *stand), gl(lie),,*(kneel), bring),
(hang), *wear), Ot(install)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.869278333333333">
Amb(Ambiguous) include those words
which describe different situations in
different context. For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.572904">
Exp. 2:
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.969596272727273">
IVEKtIlirmt. (they hung the picture on the wall.)
PM-4110h (Picture is hanging on the wall.)
In Exp. 2, the two sentences have the
same predicate ‘g (hang). In the first
sentence, 11 describes an instantaneous
action, but the second sentence describes a
state. In English, forms of these two
predicates are different; while in Chinese,
they are the same. For this reason, we
consider it ambiguous and indistinguishable
without context.
We have pointed out previously that
phase depends only on meaning. However
different situational types collocate with
different words. So the essence of our
algorithm is replace semantic judgement
with collocational judgement. For example,
Men(MentalityY can follow It (very) .
Verbs in the &amp;quot;Am13&apos; category can followed
by &amp;quot;I1A(preposition-object)&apos; structures, etc.
The following is the set of collocational
features.

2.3 Implementation of the algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987891263157895">
According to table 2.1, a classification
algorithm was designed, and we use two
resources to implement our algorithm: The
Contemporary Chinese Cihai [11] (which
we will refer to as the Cihai below)
dictionary and the Machine Tractable
Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese
Predicate Verbs [12}(which we will refer to
as the predicate dictionary below). The
Cihai dictionary includes 12,000 entries and
700,000 collocation instances, predicate
dictionary includes about 3000 verbs with
their semantic information, case relations
and detailed collocation information. These
two dictionaries both include some of the
collocation information that the algorithm
needs.
Considering the features of these two
dictionaries, we adjust part of our algorithm:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9615545">
(1) In predicate dictionary, there is a slot
named &amp;quot;verb type&apos;, which includes
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.907166083333333">
transitive ver13&apos; , &apos;intransitive ver13&apos; ,
&apos;atributive ver13&apos; , linking verb&apos; etc. So, at
the beginning of the algorithm, we judge if
the verb is a &amp;quot;linking verb&apos; (
MbeY , *T-(equal3&apos; ,etc) or a &amp;quot;possessive
verb&apos; ( NA&apos; (have)). If it is, we directly
classify the verb as &amp;quot;atkattributeY without
further processing.
(2) The predicate dictionary provides the
case relation of verbs, and their semantic
ategories. We restrict the agent of verbs in
the &amp;quot;Men(mentality)&apos; to belong to one of:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99701">

<bodyText confidence="0.907089866666667">

(collectivity)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;{ti} (creatures)&apos; 1&apos;11(
belief)&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;{ft}(animal) &amp;quot; (3) Because
Cihai includes collocation instances instead
of collocation relations, we should consider
synonyms. To be exact, when we determine
whether a verb belongs to &amp;quot;Men(Mentality7
or not, we judge if it can follow
11/ (very) and synonyms such as
VA&amp;quot;, ni*&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;3)M&apos;,
However, some seldom seen instances were
included. All these cause some errors.
The final algorithm is as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.978639965517241">
Chinese is a very complex language.
Replacing semantic judgment by using
collocations has limitation itself For
example, in most cases, whether a verb is
durative or not can be decided by whether it
can be used in such structure &amp;quot;verb-E! *&amp;quot; (In
most case, &amp;quot; S represents an action in
progress). But some instantaneous verbs
such as V(knock)&apos; , can also be used in
such structure to express a repeated action.
(2) Errors caused by the resources
(2.1) Collocation incompleteness in
Cihai: for example, WdisagreeY can
collocate with It (very), but this
collocation is not included in Cihai.
(2.2)Errors caused by predicate dictionary:
It is obvious that a certain proportion of
dictionary errors is inevitable. For example,
though `V (beg) can follow to
represent the action is in progress, it is not
included in the corresponding slot of
predicate dictionary.
(2.3) The inconsistency between the two
dictionaries: For example,
nt (admire), `YEIP (mind), and &amp;quot;giCZ (
belittle) are included in predicate dictionary
but not in Cihai. Although lto (regret) is
included in Cihai , it is taken as an adjective
instead of a verb.

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978153846154">
In this paper, we advance a phase-based
method to analyze temporal information in
Chinese. For this purpose, an algorithm is
rendered to classify verbs into different
situation types. Because a verb s situation
depends on the meaning of the verb, the
essence of our algorithm takes advantage of
collocations to avoid semantics. The result
shows the algorithm is successful. We also
believe that if the errors caused by resources
were eliminated, the result would be
improved significantly.
Although the five categories are defined
by us, they can describe basic situations of
Chinese. The classification algorithm itself
is independent of resources, so it can be
applied to other resources (dictionaries) if
these resources include sufficient collocation
information. Furthermore, Discarding
dictionaries and doing classification directly
on large-scale real corpus, especially in
certain domain, deserve the future research.
Our algorithm is very useful for the
future analysis of sentence situation for
Information Extraction system and for
dictionary construction.

The most important are Vendler(1967), Bache(1982), and Smith (1985) . They approximately classify the situation as four types: state, activity, accomplishment, and achievement. Chinese researchers have also done considerable work, among which the most typical research were done by Chen[3] and Ma[5]. Ma[5] stated that the situation of a sentence is fully determined by the situation of the main verb of the sentence.

In table 1.1 the difference between category V2 and V3, in table 1.3, the difference between &amp;quot;activitf and &amp;quot;accomplishment&apos; , are attributed to telicity. But in information process, we need not distinguish whether an event is telic or not. For example, Exp.1 fthalYAM. (He is playing the flute) flialX &apos;We . (He is playing a song &amp;quot;Liangzhu&amp;quot; ) Chen[3] thinks that in Exp. 1, the first sentence has the features: dynamicity, and durativity, and non-telicity; it belongs to &amp;quot;activity&apos; . The second sentence has the features dynamicity, durativity, and telicity, because in the second sentence, there is a default terminal----when the song liangzhif is over, the action &amp;quot;play&apos; is over, so the sentence belongs to &apos;accomplishment&apos; instead of &amp;quot;activit)P . However we think such discrimination is useless for information extraction, because telicity is an ambiguous concept itself. What we need is to acquire the exact duration of the event.
