The main purpose of this paper is the ex-
ploitation and application of an audio and
video bimodal corpus of the Chinese lan-
guage in broadcasting. It deals with the
designation of the size and structure of
speech samples according to radio and
television program features. Secondly, it
discusses annotation method of broadcast
speech with achievements made and sug-
gested future improvements. Finally, it
presents an attempt to describe the distri-

<bodyText confidence="0.999891583333333">
Since the year of 2002, we’ve been engaged in
setting up the Media Language Corpus aimed to
provide the language resources for the research-
ers who are interested in broadcasting and televi-
sion media language, for teachers and for re-
searchers of presentation art. Up till now, we
have established a 50 million word text corpus
involving 40 million word television program
text corpora and 10 million word radio program
text corpora with 10 million annotated word cor-
pora. The work of this paper is to introduce a
ten-hour segmented and prosodic labeled broad-
cast audio &amp; video bimodal corpus that we built
just now.
Section 2 of this paper describes a method for
selection of radio and television programs to re-
cord according to program features on radio and
television stations. Recording conditions are pro-
posed to record a quality spoken language corpus.
Section 3 is dedicated to annotation methods.
Section 4 shows the distribution of syllables, ini-
tials, finals and tones etc. Finally, section 5 con-
tains the conclusion and outlines of our future
work in this field.

First of all, we have to select radio and television
programs to record. Since a broadcast bimodal
corpus should represent the real life usages of
spoken language in radio and television, the dif-
ferences between radio and television, the differ-
ences between central and local televisions, and
the categories of programs should all together be
taken into account during the process of collect-
ing. The followings are the framework (.wav
files &amp; .mpeg files matched with .txt files) of

2.2 Corpus structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997509">
The purpose of building the broadcast spoken
language corpus is to provide the service for the
research of broadcast spoken language, esp. for
the contrastive studies of the prosodic features of
different genres of broadcast language. Hence,
the selections of samples of the corpus mainly
involve monologues, dialogues or both. As the
performing forms of radio and television pro-
grams are getting more and more diverse, it is
very difficult to decide whether a program is a
monologue or dialogue, because these two gen-
res of programs often co-occur in one program.
Furthermore, these kinds of programs are in-
creasing their share of radio and television pro-
grams. Consequently, this kind of program is
most frequent in the corpus. Table 1 displays the
structural framework of the broadcast audio and
video bimodal corpus.

2.3 Recording &amp; management information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96275325">
All the recorded data are over the programs on
radio and TV, that is, it is recorded directly from
radio and TV programs by Pinnacle PCTV pro
card to connect cable TV with our recording
computers. The recorded speech data are saved
as 22 kHz and 16bit, Windows PCM waveform,
the video data are saved as MPEG or WMV for-
mat file by Ulead VideoStudio in a post-
processing step. Every program or segment of
programs is composed of three parts: *.wav
data, *.txt data, and *.mpeg/.wmv data.
Zhao Shixia et al (2000) pointed out that the
structure of a speech corpus consists of synchro-
nized objects (text files, wav files, and annotated
prosodic files), arranged in deep hierarchies (re-
cording environment), and labeled with speaker-
attribute metadata. Therefore, the managed ob-
jects of our broadcast bimodal corpus are inte-
grated programs or segments of programs. All
data are stored separately but have complex logi-
cal inter-relations. These inter-relations can be
obtained through the description of the programs.

3 Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963375">
Why should we annotate a corpus? An annota-
tion is the fundamental act of associating some
content to a region in a signal. The annotation
quality and depth have a direct impact on the
utility and possible applications of the corpus
(Ding Xinshan 1998). The annotation of our cor-
pus consists of transcription, segmental annota-
tion, and prosodic annotation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998411">
3.1 Transcription and segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997815">
Transcription is primarily composed of pinyin
transcription of Chinese characters. Besides,
tones are annotated “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” after
the syllable, the neutral tone is labeled “0”; final
“%” annotated as “v”, and “%e” annotated as “ue”,
for example, “旅 (lǚ)” annotated as “lv3”, “虐
(n%è)” annotated as “nue4”.
In the utterance, compared with broken sylla-
bles, successive speech alters greatly, due to the
influence of co-articulation, semantics and pros-
ody. The purpose of segmental annotating is to
annotate the altered phonemes in the syllables
amidst the utterance. For instances, the voicing
of some plosives (e.g. b, d, g); labial’s influence
on alveolar nasal (e.g. “-n” in “renmin” affected
by the initial of “min” gradually change into
“labionasal”,demonstrating the similarities be-
tween alveolar nasal and labionasal initial in the
frequency spectrum). In the places of unapparent
pauses, the stop in the front of plosives esp. af-

3.2 Prosodic annotation tiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969571428571">
Prosodic annotation increases the utility of a
speech corpus. An annotated speech corpus can
not only offer us a database for the research and
exploration of speech information but can also
enlarge our knowledge of speech and prosodic
features through a visual and scientific method.
Prosodic annotation is a categorical descrip-
tion for the prosodic features with linguistic
functions, in other words, annotation of the
changes of tone, the patterns of stress, and the
prosodic structure with linguistic functions. The
prosodic labeling conventions are a set of ma-
chine-readable codes for transforming speech
prosodies and rule conventions. Based on ToBI
(Kim Silverman et al. 1992, John F. Pitrelli et al.
1994) and C-ToBI Conventions (Li Aijun 2002),
according to the practical needs of broadcast
speech language, the prosodic annotation mainly
involves labeling the following parallel tiers:
break index, stress index, and intonation con-
struction tier (Chen Yudong 2004, Zou Yu 2004).
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.492438">
3.2.1 Break indices tier
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843384615385">
Based on Cao Jianfen’s (1999, 2001) categories
of prosodic hierarchy structure combined with
the practical needs of broadcast speech, we iden-
tified five break levels (0-4): 0 indicates the si-
lence or the boundary of default internal sylla-
bles amidst the prosodic words. 1 stands for the
boundaries of the prosodic words including the
short breaks with silent pause and breaks with
filled pause. The prosodic words are the funda-
mental prosodic units in broadcast speech. Sim-
ple prosodic words are composed of 1~3 sylla-
bles. Complex prosodic words normally contain
5~9 syllables, e.g., “Shang4hai3 he2zuo4
zu3zhi1” (i.e. the Shanghai Cooperation Organi-
zation). Break level 2 designates the boundaries
of the prosodic phrases, most of which are ap-
parent breaks with silent pause, and their patterns
of pitch have also changed. Break level 3 repre-
sent the boundaries of intonational phrases, or
the boundaries of sentences. Break level 4 stands
for the boundaries of intonation groups, similar
to the boundary of the entire piece of news in a
news broadcast, or of a talker turn in dialogue.
At indefinite boundaries, the code “-” is added
after the numbers. The labels of the break tier
occurring times are shown in table 2:

<bodyText confidence="0.999610814814815">
Stress is a significant prosodic feature. In train-
ing materials for broadcast announcers, emphasis
is laid on labeling the stress on the basis of the
purpose of the utterance, the pattern and rhythm
of stresses, and the changes of emotions. Zhang
Song’s (1983) classification of nuclear stresses
can be the guideline for broadcasting production
and practice. However, there are some shortcom-
ings in his classifications, for instances, the
vague hierarchies between the sentences and dis-
courses. This gets in the way of the formal de-
scription of the stresses by the computers. Never-
theless, his theories on the judgment of primary
and minor stresses (i.e. non-stresses, minor
stresses, primary stresses etc.) have some refer-
ence value for stress annotations, because distin-
guishing the hierarchies of stress is a crucial
practical problem for annotation.
As to the problems with the hierarchies of
stress, most of the experimental phonetics and
speech processing researchers adopt Lin Mao-
can’s (2001, 2002) classifications of stress hier-
archies or some similar classifications. That is to
say, the levels of stress include prosodic word
stress, prosodic phrase stress, and sentence stress
(or nuclear stress) in Chinese. According to real
life broadcasting productions, this paper identi-

fies four categories of stresses in broadcast
speech: the rhythm unit, the cross rhythm unit,
the clause, and the discourse. Among them, the
discourse stress often occurs at the place of an
accented syllable, but they are relatively more
important than the other sentence stresses. The
labeling methods of all the ranks are listed as
follows (Chen Yudong 2004):

Furthermore, Zhang Song&apos;s (1983) other crite-
ria for stress annotation (utterance purpose and
emotion change), while perceptually important,
are meta-linguistic or para-linguistic in character,
and will therefore not be addressed in this paper.

3.2.3 Intonation construction tier
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.942703090909091">
In line with Shen Jiong’s view about intonation
(Shen Jiong 1994), we found that the intonation
construction tier is an important component of
the annotation of discourses (Chen Yudong
2004). It can display the changes of sentence in-
tonation structures. The annotation of the intona-
tion construction is mainly to label the relation-
ship of other syllables to the nuclear stress apart
from prehead, dissociation etc. For example:

A sentence can have one nuclear stress, or
multiple nuclear stresses.
Single nuclear stress: representing the fore-
and-aft places of the nuclear stress, the steepness
of nuclear stress, and the length of nuclear stress.
Examples are listed as follows:
P-H-N-T;
P-H-H-N;
... ...
Among the above examples, long nuclear
splitting type “H-N-T-H-N’-T”, with the features
of multi-nuclear “H-N1-T-H-N2-T” is greatly
similar to multi-nuclear. However, “H-N-T-H-
N’-T” differs from multi-nuclear in its dependent
grammar unit.
Multi-nuclear stress: The two or more nuclear
stresses in a multi-nuclear sentence take the pat-
terns of like independent sentence intonation
constructions, each with its own nucleus, pre-
ceded by a head and optional prehead, and fol-
lowed by a tail. In other words, these relatively
independent patterns already have the features of
relatively independent intonation constructions,
with the apparent features of “prehead, head, and
nuclear ending”. This kind of nuclear stress often
occurs in relatively longer and more complex
constructions. Intonation constructions can be
labeled separately. A case in point is the contras-
tive sentence “zai4 wen3 ding4 de0 ji1 chu3
shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 gao1 su4 de0 fa1
zhan3” (i.e. It got a comparative high-speed de-
velopment on the stable conditions) that can be
annotated as “H-N1-T, H-N2-T”. For example:

The broadcast audio and video bimodal corpus1
is a presentation art-oriented corpus with radio
and television news as its basis. This paper
probes the development and compilation of
broadcast audio and video bimodal corpus.
Firstly, on the collection of the corpus, what
sort of audio and video corpus can represent the
features of radio and television speech language?
How can we auto-annotate the audio and video
corpus? ...These are the problems that have al-
ways been bothering us.
Secondly, this corpus can be a platform for
further research into non-accented or accented
syllables, intonation construction, the prosodic
functions of paragraphs and discourses, the emo-
tions of speech, and genre styles.
Finally, we can statistically analyze the spec-
tral and prosodic characteristics of various speak-
ing styles by the corpora, such as presentation,
reading and talk. All speaking styles would be
synthesized based on the analysis results. This is
also work for the future.

<abstract confidence="0.998799307692308">The main purpose of this paper is the exploitation and application of an audio and video bimodal corpus of the Chinese language in broadcasting. It deals with the designation of the size and structure of speech samples according to radio and television program features. Secondly, it discusses annotation method of broadcast speech with achievements made and suggested future improvements. Finally, it presents an attempt to describe the distribution of annotated items in our corpus.</abstract>

The prosodic labeling conventions are a set of machine-readable codes for transforming speech prosodies and rule conventions. Based on ToBI (Kim Silverman et al. 1992, John F. Pitrelli et al. 1994) and C-ToBI Conventions (Li Aijun 2002), according to the practical needs of broadcast speech language, the prosodic annotation mainly involves labeling the following parallel tiers: break index, stress index, and intonation construction tier (Chen Yudong 2004, Zou Yu 2004). 3.2.1 Break indices tier Based on Cao Jianfen’s (1999, 2001) categories of prosodic hierarchy structure combined with the practical needs of broadcast speech, we identified five break levels (0-4): 0 indicates the silence or the boundary of default internal syllables amidst the prosodic words. 1 stands for the boundaries of the prosodic words including the short breaks with silent pause and breaks with filled pause. The prosodic words are the fundamental prosodic units in broadcast speech. Simple prosodic words are composed of 1~3 syllables. Complex prosodic words normally cont</context>

That is to say, the levels of stress include prosodic word stress, prosodic phrase stress, and sentence stress (or nuclear stress) in Chinese. According to real life broadcasting productions, this paper identi104 fies four categories of stresses in broadcast speech: the rhythm unit, the cross rhythm unit, the clause, and the discourse. Among them, the discourse stress often occurs at the place of an accented syllable, but they are relatively more important than the other sentence stresses. The labeling methods of all the ranks are listed as follows (Chen Yudong 2004): Table 3 the stress levels in the stress indices tier Ranks Labels Rhythm unit 1 Cross rhythm unit 2 Clause 3 Discourse 4 Table 4 the stress levels’ mean of duration in 4 hours annotated corpora Furthermore, Zhang Song&apos;s (1983) other criteria for stress annotation (utterance purpose and emotion change), while perceptually important, are meta-linguistic or para-linguistic in character, and will therefore not be addressed in this paper. 3.2.3 Intonation construction tier In line with Shen Jiong’s view about intonation (Shen Jiong 1994), we found that the intonation construction tier is an impor</context>

It can display the changes of sentence intonation structures. The annotation of the intonation construction is mainly to label the relationship of other syllables to the nuclear stress apart from prehead, dissociation etc. For example: Table 5 the labels of the intonation construction tier occurring in 4 hours annotated corpora Labels Description Occurrence P Prehead 794 H Head 2980 N Nucleus 2400 T Tail 1600 W Weak in stress 2321 D Dissociation 527 Top Topic 269 Conj </context>
