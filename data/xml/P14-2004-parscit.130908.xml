Dialog topic tracking aims at analyzing
and maintaining topic transitions in on-
going dialogs. This paper proposes a com-
posite kernel approach for dialog topic
tracking to utilize various types of do-
main knowledge obtained from Wikipedia.
Two kernels are defined based on history
sequences and context trees constructed
based on the extracted features. The ex-
perimental results show that our compos-
ite kernel approach can significantly im-
prove the performances of topic tracking
in mixed-initiative human-human dialogs.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999965338461539">
Human communications in real world situations
interlace multiple topics which are related to each
other in conversational contexts. This fact sug-
gests that a dialog system should be also capable
of conducting multi-topic conversations with users
to provide them a more natural interaction with the
system. However, the majority of previous work
on dialog interfaces has focused on dealing with
only a single target task. Although some multi-
task dialog systems have been proposed (Lin et al.,
1999; Ikeda et al., 2008; Celikyilmaz et al., 2011),
they have aimed at just choosing the most proba-
ble one for each input from the sub-systems, each
of which is independently operated from others.
To analyze and maintain dialog topics from a
more systematic perspective in a given dialog flow,
some researchers (Nakata et al., 2002; Lagus and
Kuusisto, 2002; Adams and Martell, 2008) have
considered this dialog topic identification as a sep-
arate sub-problem of dialog management and at-
tempted to solve it with text categorization ap-
proaches for the recognized utterances in a given
turn. The major obstacle to the success of these
approaches results from the differences between
written texts and spoken utterances. In most text
categorization tasks, the proper category for each
textual unit can be assigned based only on its own
content. However, the dialog topic at each turn
can be determined not only by the user’s inten-
tions captured from the given utterances, but also
by the system’s decisions for dialog management
purposes. Thus, the text categorization approaches
can only be effective for the user-initiative cases
when users tend to mention the topic-related ex-
pressions explicitly in their utterances.
The other direction of dialog topic tracking ap-
proaches made use of external knowledge sources
including domain models (Roy and Subramaniam,
2006), heuristics (Young et al., 2007), and agen-
das (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003; Lee et al., 2008).
These knowledge-based methods have an advan-
tage of dealing with system-initiative dialogs, be-
cause dialog flows can be controlled by the sys-
tem based on given resources. However, this as-
pect can limit the flexibility to handle the user’s
responses which are contradictory to the system’s
suggestions. Moreover, these approaches face cost
problems for building a sufficient amount of re-
sources to cover broad states of complex dialogs,
because these resources should be manually pre-
pared by human experts for each specific domain.
In this paper, we propose a composite kernel
to explore various types of information obtained
from Wikipedia for mixed-initiative dialog topic
tracking without significant costs for building re-
sources. Composite kernels have been success-
fully applied to improve the performances in other
NLP problems (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang
et al., 2006) by integrating multiple individual ker-
nels, which aim to overcome the errors occurring
at one level by information from other levels. Our
composite kernel consists of a history sequence
and a domain context tree kernels, both of which
are composed based on similar textual units in
Wikipedia articles to a given dialog context.

2 Dialog Topic Tracking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923">
Dialog topic tracking can be considered as a clas-
sification problem to detect topic transitions. The
most probable pair of topics at just before and after
each turn is predicted by the following classifier:
f(xt) = (yt−1, yt), where xt contains the input
features obtained at a turn t, yt ∈ C, and C is a
closed set of topic categories. If a topic transition
occurs at t, yt should be different from yt−1. Oth-
erwise, both yt and yt−1 have the same value.
Figure 1 shows an example of dialog topic
tracking in a given dialog fragment on Singapore
tour guide domain between a tourist and a guide.
This conversation is divided into three segments,
since f detects three topic transitions at t1, t4 and
t6. Then, a topic sequence of ‘Attraction’, ‘Trans-
portation’, and ‘Food’ is obtained from the results.

3 Wikipedia-based Composite Kernel for
Dialog Topic Tracking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990225806452">
The classifier f can be built on the training exam-
ples annotated with topic labels using supervised
machine learning techniques. Although some fun-
damental features extracted from the utterances
mentioned at a given turn or in a certain number of
previous turns can be used for training the model,
this information obtained solely from an ongoing
dialog is not sufficient to identify not only user-
initiative, but also system-initiative topic transi-
tions.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to
leverage on Wikipedia as an external knowledge
source that can be obtained without significant
effort toward building resources for topic track-
ing. Recently, some researchers (Wilcock, 2012;
Breuing et al., 2011) have shown the feasibility
of using Wikipedia knowledge to build dialog sys-
tems. While each of these studies mainly focuses
only on a single type of information including cat-
egory relatedness or hyperlink connectedness, this
work aims at incorporating various knowledge ob-
tained from Wikipedia into the model using a com-
posite kernel method.
Our composite kernel consists of two different
kernels: a history sequence kernel and a domain
context tree kernel. Both represent the current di-
alog context at a given turn with a set of relevant
Wikipedia paragraphs which are selected based on
the cosine similarity between the term vectors of
the recently mentioned utterances and each para-
graph in the Wikipedia collection as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.982399">
sim(x,pi) = φ(x) · φ(pi)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997548">
where x is the input, pi is the i-th paragraph in
the Wikipedia collection, φ(pi) is the term vector
extracted from pi. The term vector for the input x,
φ(x), is computed by accumulating the weights in
the previous turns as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.967762">
φ(x) = (α1, α2, ··· , α|W|) ∈ R|W|,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996311785714286">
where αi = Eh(λj · tfidf(wi,u(t−j))), ut is
j=0
the utterance mentioned in a turn t, tfidf(wi, ut)
is the product of term frequency of a word wi in
ut and inverse document frequency of wi, λ is a
decay factor for giving more importance to more
recent turns, |W |is the size of word dictionary,
and h is the number of previous turns considered
as dialog history features.
After computing this relatedness between the
current dialog context and every paragraph in the
Wikipedia collection, two kernel structures are
constructed using the information obtained from
the highly-ranked paragraphs in the Wikipedia.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994334">
3.1 History Sequence Kernel
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963496">
The first structure to be constructed for our com-
posite kernel is a sequence of the most similar
paragraph IDs of each turn from the beginning of
the session to the current turn. Formally, the se-
quence S at a given turn t is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.96901">
S = (s0, ··· , st),

<bodyText confidence="0.999886142857143">
Since our hypothesis is that the more similar the
dialog histories of the two inputs are, the more
similar aspects of topic transtions occur for them,
we propose a sub-sequence kernel (Lodhi et al.,
2002) to map the data into a new feature space de-
fined based on the similarity of each pair of history
sequences as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9857795">
Ks(S1, S2) = X X X Al(i)+l(j),

where A is a finite set of paragraph IDs, S is a fi-
nite sequence of paragraph IDs, u is a subsequence
of S, S[j] is the subsequence with the i-th charac-
ters Vi E j, l(i) is the length of the subsequence,
and A E (0, 1) is a decay factor.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97667">
3.2 Domain Context Tree Kernel
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953142857143">
The other kernel incorporates more various types
of domain knowledge obtained from Wikipedia
into the feature space. In this method, each in-
stance is encoded in a tree structure constructed
following the rules in Figure 2. The root node of
a tree has few children, each of which is a subtree
rooted at each paragraph node in:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.950212">
Pt = {pi|sim (xt, pi) &gt; 01,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977615384616">
where 0 is a threshold value to select the relevant
paragraphs. Each subtree consists of a set of fea-
tures from a given paragraph in the Wikipedia col-
lection in a hierarchical structure. Figure 3 shows
an example of a constructed tree.
Since this constructed tree structure represents
semantic, discourse, and structural information
extracted from the similar Wikipedia paragraphs
to each given instance, we can explore these more
enriched features to build the topic tracking model
using a subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy,
2002) which computes the similarity between each
pair of trees in the feature space as follows:

where NT is the set of T’s nodes, A (n1, n2) =
Pi Ii (ni) · Ii (n2), and Ii(n) is a function that is
1 iff the i-th tree fragment occurs with root at node
n and 0 otherwise.

and tourists. All the recorded dialogs with the total
length of 21 hours were manually transcribed, then
these transcribed dialogs with 19,651 utterances
were manually annotated with the following nine
topic categories: Opening, Closing, Itinerary, Ac-
commodation, Attraction, Food, Transportation,
Shopping, and Other.
Since we aim at developing the system which
acts as a guide communicating with tourist users,
an instance for both training and prediction of
topic transition was created for each turn of
tourists. The annotation of an instance is a pair of
previous and current topics, and the actual number
of labels occurred in the dataset is 65.
For each instance, the term vector was gener-
ated from the utterances in current user turn, previ-
ous system turn, and history turns within the win-
dow sizes h = 10. Then, the history sequence and
tree context structures for our composite kernel
were constructed based on 3,155 articles related
to Singapore collected from Wikipedia database
dump as of February 2013. For the linear ker-
nel baseline, we used the following features: n-
gram words, previous system actions, and current
user acts which were manually annotated. Finally,
8,318 instances were used for training the model.
We trained the SVM models using
SVMlighr 1 (Joachims, 1999) with the follow-
ing five different combinations of kernels: Kl
only, Kl with P as features, Kl+K3, Kl+Kt, and
Kl + K3 + Kt. The threshold value θ for selecting
P was 0.5, and the combinations of kernels were
performed with the same α, Q, or γ coefficient
values for all sub-kernels. All the evaluations
were done in five-fold cross validation to the man-
ual annotations with two different metrics: one
is accuracy of the predicted topic label for every
turn, and the other is precision/recall/F-measure
for each event of topic transition occurred either
in the answer or the predicted result.
Table 1 compares the performances of the five
combinations of kernels. When just the para-
graph IDs were included as additional features,
it failed to improve the performances from the
baseline without any external features. However,
our proposed kernels using history sequences and
domain context trees achieved significant perfor-
mances improvements for both evaluation metrics.
While the history sequence kernel enhanced the
coverage of the model to detect topic transitions,

duce more precise outputs. Finally, the model
combining all the kernels outperformed the base-
line by 7.53% in turn-level accuracy and 10.81%
in transition-level F-measure.
The error distributions in Figure 4 indicate that
these performance improvements were achieved
by resolving the errors not only on user-initiative
topic transitions, but also on system-initiative
cases, which implies the effectiveness of the struc-
tured knowledge from Wikipedia to track the top-
ics in mixed-initiative dialogs.

Each subtree consists of a set of features from a given paragraph in the Wikipedia collection in a hierarchical structure. Figure 3 shows an example of a constructed tree. Since this constructed tree structure represents semantic, discourse, and structural information extracted from the similar Wikipedia paragraphs to each given instance, we can explore these more enriched features to build the topic tracking model using a subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002) which computes the similarity between each pair of trees in the feature space as follows: X Kt(T1,T2) = n1ENT1 where NT is the set of T’s nodes, A (n1, n2) = Pi Ii (ni) · Ii (n2), and Ii(n) is a function that is 1 iff the i-th tree fragment occurs with root at node n and 0 otherwise. 3.3 Kernel Composition In this work, a composite kernel is defined by combining the individual kernels including history sequence and domain context tree kernels, as well as &lt;TREE&gt;:=(ROOT &lt;PAR&gt;...&lt;PAR&gt;) &lt;PAR&gt;:=(PAR_ID &lt;PARENTS&gt; &lt;PREV_PAR&gt;&lt;NEXT_PAR&gt;&lt;LINKS&gt;) &lt;PARENTS&gt;:=(‘PARENTS’ &lt;ART&gt;&lt;SEC&gt;) &lt;ART&gt;:=(ART_ID &lt;ART_NAM</context>

For the linear kernel baseline, we used the following features: ngram words, previous system actions, and current user acts which were manually annotated. Finally, 8,318 instances were used for training the model. We trained the SVM models using SVMlighr 1 (Joachims, 1999) with the following five different combinations of kernels: Kl only, Kl with P as features, Kl+K3, Kl+Kt, and Kl + K3 + Kt. The threshold value θ for selecting P was 0.5, and the combinations of kernels were performed with the same α, Q, or γ coefficient values for all sub-kernels. All the evaluations were done in five-fold cross validation to the manual annotations with two different metrics: one is accuracy of the predicted topic label for every turn, and the other is precision/recall/F-measure for each event of topic transition occurred either in the answer or the predicted result.

Moreover, these approaches face cost problems for building a sufficient amount of resources to cover broad states of complex dialogs, because these resources should be manually prepared by human experts for each specific domain. In this paper, we propose a composite kernel to explore various types of information obtained from Wikipedia for mixed-initiative dialog topic tracking without significant costs for building resources. Composite kernels have been successfully applied to improve the performances in other NLP problems (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) by integrating multiple individual kernels, which aim to overcome the errors occurring at one level by information from other levels.
