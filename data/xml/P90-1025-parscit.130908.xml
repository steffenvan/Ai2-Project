ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.998906083333333">
Current complex-feature based grammars use a sin-
gle procedure—unification—for a multitude of pur-
poses, among them, enforcing formal agreement
between purely syntactic features. This paper
presents evidence from several natural languages that
unification—variable-matching combined with variable
substitution—is the wrong mechanism for effecting
agreement. The view of grammar developed here is
one in which unification is used for semantic interpre-
tation, while purely formal agreement involves only
a check for non-distinctness—i.e. variable-matching
without variable substitution.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998317695652174">
In recent years, a great deal of attention has been de-
voted to complex-feature based grammar formalisms—
i.e. grammar formalisms in which syntactic elements
are not atomic symbols, but rather complex elements,
such as value-attribute or term structures; see Shieber
(1986) for an overview. Typically such formalisms use
a single mechanism—variable substitution—for all pur-
poses, and the most widely used variable substitution
mechanism is unification.1 Such complex-feature based
grammars, then, are viewed as systems in which partial
feature structures are built up, by the process of unifica-
tion, into successively more specified structures. While
it is formally elegant to use a single mechanism for a
number of purposes, this theoretical elegance is real-
ized in practice only if the mechanism does not require
the other modules of the system to be complicated to
achieve this &amp;quot;elegance&amp;quot;. Currently, unification is used
for at least four purposes:
11n thc mat of this paper, for convenience I will use the term
&amp;quot;unification&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;variable substitution&amp;quot;. since it is the most
commonly used type of variable substitution, but it should be home
in mind that the point being made hem hoick for variable substitution,
in general.

• to enforce formal agreement between purely syn-
tactic features
• to &amp;quot;percolate&amp;quot; features between a pre-terminal cat-
egory and the phrase which it heads
• to pass features between a dislocated element—
such as a WH-phrase—and its trace

This paper will focus on the use of unification to
enforce agreement and will present evidence from sev-
eral natural languages which argues against its use in
the case of purely formal syntactic features: when such
features are lexically or morphologically underspecifted,
they remain so, even under agreement, contrary to the
predictions of a system using unification for agreement.
Moreover, it is worthwhile stressing at the outset that
the main argument of this paper is not that there are
certain constructions that present a problem for unifica-
tion, and, hence, require some technical solution. The
point is much stronger: even if some elaborate analy-
sis can be devised that allows unification to be used to
effect agreement, this would be the wrong tack to take.
Rather, the argument will go, using unification to effect
agreement is incorrect both for theoretical reasons—it
presents a view of language which is contradicted by
the facts—and for practical reasons—using unification
to effect agreement can impede a system&apos;s robustness
and transportability.

2 The Paradox
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698666666667">
A typical paradigm that is presented to show the almost
transparent application of unification to agreement phe-
nomena is the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8416288">
(1) a. &apos;The sheep is ready.
b. The sheep are ready.

<bodyText confidence="0.989115344827586">
Sentences (10 through (1d) are taken to indicate
that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; is underspecified with regard to number, it
can be either singular or plural. (le), on the other hand,
shows that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; cannot be both singular and plural
at the same time. In the relative clause, &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; is marked
as singular, and &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;, interpreted as its subject via
the relative connector &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, must also be singular. On
the other hand, &amp;quot;are&amp;quot; in the matrix clause is marked
as plural, and &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;, its subject, must also be plural.
Under a unification analysis, these facts are explained
in the following way: &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; is syntactically unspeci-
fied for the feature number. The process of subject-verb
agreement is effected by unification. Therefore, when
&amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; appears as the subject of a finite verb, unifica-
tion will fix its number as singular or plural (unless the
finite verb itself is ambiguous). (le) is ungrammatical,
then, since the values singular and plural cannot unify
and the fact that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; must agree with both &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;are&amp;quot; in number would require their unification.
This illegal feature configuration is shown in (2).
(2) [V [nurn:sg]] [N [nurn:{sg,p1}]] [V [numpli]
(&amp;quot;is&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;are&amp;quot;)
Here, the arrows indicate the notional flow of informa-
tion under agreement, but have no theoretical status.
They indicate that agreement between &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;
would set &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; &apos;s number feature to singular, while
agreement with &amp;quot;are&amp;quot; would set it to plural. More gen-
erally, the unification approach to agreement rules out
the following configuration:

<listItem confidence="0.964305">
(3) *IX –+ EY LF:{12,fi}ll [Z [17:0]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999047">
Here [F : x] denotes feature F, with value a, and
[F: {a, y}] indicates feature F with value either a or
y, a and y distinct. Thus, this schema indicates that a
category which is specified for the values a and 3 for
feature F cannot simultaneously agree in this feature
with categories that specify distinct values for F. In the
rest of this section, I will show eases of constructions
which match this schema but are still grammatical.

2.1 Case 1: German Free Relatives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787333333333">
In German, as Groos and van Riemsdijk (1979) demon-
strate, free relative clauses require that the relative pro-
noun agree in Case both with the position of the rela-
tive clause as a whole and also with the position with
which the relative pronoun is construed (Le. with the
gap which the relative pronoun fills). This is shown
in (4) and (5), where the matrix verb and the verb in
the free relative are annotated with the Case the relative
pronoun must bear in that clause.

Assuming that &amp;quot;Case assignment&amp;quot; is actually a form
of agreement between a verb and a noun phrase that it
governs, the data in (4)–(5) seems to fit nicely into
a unification approach. However, the neuter free rel-
ative pronoun was, which is both nominative and ac-
cusative, can seemingly agree with both nominative and
accusative Case assigning elements at the same time:

we should expect (6) and (7) to be ungrammatical.

A possible solution to this seeming paradox,
which still uses unification to effect agreement, is the
following.2 Assume that Case in German is not a
single-valued feature, but rather an array of the differ-
ent Cases of the language, each of which takes on one
of the values T or NIL. We can then handle the data
above with the following feature specifications. (The
(a) representations use a &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; notation, consisting of
attribute-value pairs, like that in Shieber (1986); while
the (b) representations use a term notation, with posi-
tional features, like that in Definite Clause Grammars
(Pereira and Warren (1980)).)

Assuming that a verb is only specified for the Case
it assigns and is unspecified for the others, the Case
specifications for verbs that take nominal complements
would be:

b. (CASE Nal ?val T ?val)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.663881333333333">
Similarly, the Case specification for nominative
Case assignment, whether this is a property of syntactic
structures or of particular lexical items, would be:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8851685">
(15) a. [case: [nom: TJ]

This solution works, then, because was, and no
other free relative pronouns, specifies the value T for

more than one element in its Case array and because
verbs and other Case &amp;quot;assigning&amp;quot; elements only specify
a value for the Case they &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot;, and for no others.
This solution of factoring out seemingly contradictory
values for a single feature into values of different fea-
tures allows us to get around the superficial violation of
the schema in (3). However, there are other construc-
tions which are harder to decompose in this fashion.

2.2 Case 2: Hungarian WH Movement
and Topicalimtion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878625">
Let us now turn to a more complicated example, from
Hungarian, described in Szamosi (1976). In Hungarian,
WH words, like full NPs, are marked as either definite
or indefinite. The verb in Hungarian is also marked as
definite or indefinite, in agreement with its complement.
When the complement is an accusative noun phrase, the
definiteness marking on verb and noun phrase is the
same.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956894740740741">
(16) a. Akart egy kdnyvet.

b. *Akarta egy konyvet.

c. *Akart a konyvet.

d. Akarta a konyvet.

e. Egy konyv amit akart

*DEF +DEF
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.888778666666667">
&apos;This book is the one which he wanted.&apos;
When the complement is a finite clause, the verb bears
definite agreement.

*JAnos akart, hogy elhozzak egy kOnyvet.
John wanted that I-bring a book
–DEF +DEF
&apos;John wanted me to bring a book.&apos;
Finally, WH phrases and topicalized constituents in
Hungarian typically appear immediately preceding the
verb; verb and WH word or topicalized noun phrase
must agree in definiteness.3 From these constraints, it
follows that WH phrases and topicalized noun phrases
extracted from complement clauses must be marked
definite. Since the clausal complement forces the verb
to bear definite agreement, and since the WH word or
topicalized NP must agree with the verb in definiteness,
the WH word or topicalized NP can only be definite.
This is shown in the following examples:
However, certain Hungarian verb forms4 bear an
ending which is ambiguous between definite and indef-
inite. In sentences involving such verbs, the WH word
may be indefinite.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.832199875">

<bodyText confidence="0.8230295">
Once again, the grammatical (20) and (21) match
the prohibited schema (3) (&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;complementizer&amp;quot;):
(22) a. [N [def:–] [V [der.{+, –}] [c [def:+]

Let us consider the consequences of expanding out
the definiteness feature into an array of separate values,
analogous to the German example. First, this would
require the underspecified verb forms to be represented
as in (23).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978535666666667">
(23) alcamdrik,akartam:
a. [definiteness: [definite: &amp;quot;I] [indefinite: TJ]
b. (DEFINITENESS T T)

<bodyText confidence="0.6951435">
Next, it would require that the WH pronouns be speci-
fied as in (24) and (23):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994044">

b. (DEFINITENESS ?val T)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965551724138">
Note that when either of these pronouns appeared
with an underspecified definite and indefinite verb, such
as those in (23), it would wind up with the definiteness
specification in (23). This would totally neutralize the
definiteness/indefiniteness contrast in such cases. But,
in fact, no such ambiguity of interpretation is reported:
a definite or indefinite WH phrase or topicalized noun
phrase that appears in the suitable configuration with
one of these ambiguously definite or indefinite verbs is
interpreted as uniquely definite or indefinite, as is con-
sistent with its overt marking, and not as ambiguous
between definite and indefinite, as the proposed unifi-
cation analysis would require. Thus, this unification
based solution to a problem of a morphological ambi-
guity entails an ambiguity of interpretation that is not
attested.
Moreover, aside from the empirically incorrect pre-
dictions about semantic interpretation, there is a more
fundamental problem with the unification account of
agreement. As was pointed out above, treating agree-
ment as unification implies that structures meeting the
schema in (3) should be superficially ungrammatical. In
fact, this seems to be universally false: in every case in
natural language in which an element does not morpho-
logically distinguish between two or more values of a
feature—a situation often referred to as morphological
neutralization—it behaves as if this distinction is also
neutralized for purposes of agreement. That is, instead
of the configuration in (3) being universally ruled out,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990441">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817375">
it is universally attested. This creates a paradox, since
the ungrammaticality of (le) seems to depend on the
ungrammaticality of structures matching the configura-
tion in (3). To demonstrate that this seeming paradox is
supported by the data, in the rest of this section, other
examples will be presented to show that the configura-
tion ruled out in (3) recurs again and again across the
languages of the world.

<bodyText confidence="0.946187625">
In French, as Kayne (1975) points out, it is possible to
conjoin past participles following the past auxiliary and
a weak (&amp;quot;chic&amp;quot;) object pronoun which is the common
object of the conjoined participles, under the require-
ment that the verbs of the conjuncts assign the pronoun
the same Case. This is shown in (26) and (27):

The previous section presented a paradox. There seems
to be evidence, in the form of ungrarnatical utterances
such as (le), that the configuration in (3) is ungram-

evidence from different constructions and different lan-
guages which strongly indicates that (3) is the stan-

of the world. In this section, I will resolve this paradox
by proposing that agreement is not effected by unifi-

First, let us return to example (le), repeated here for
convenience
(38) *The sheep that is ready are there.
Recall that the analysis of this utterance which argued
for the ungrammaticality of configuration (3) was based
on the assumption that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; is unspecified or under-
specified for number. Note that this analysis is tenable
if syntactic features alone are considered: syntactically,
it seems plausible that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; either has no number
feature or that it has a variable, rather than a constant,
as the value of this feature. However, when the ramifi-
cations of this analysis for semantics are considered, it
becomes less tenable: while syntactic frameworks have
been constructed in which features can take on under-
specified values, most semantic frameworks require fea-
tures such as singular/plural to be fully specified. That
is, semantically, &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; can denote an individual or
a set of individuals5 but it cannot denote something
indeterminate. This suggests that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; is not un-
derspecified, or vague, but rather ambiguous. That is,
there is not a single representation for &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;, which
is underspecified for number, but rather two distinct
entries, fully specified for number in both its syntactic
and semantic aspects. If this is the case, the reason that
(38) is ungrammatical is not that unification has filled
in the underspecified value for number, but rather that
subject-verb agreement disambiguates which of the two
senses of &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; has been encountered and once one of
3Nothing in the present argument hinges on this being the correct
treatment of the singular/plural distinction. It does not matter which
of the various proposals about the semantic interpretation of number is
chosen. All that matters is that semantic theories require that singular
and plural have different denotations, and do not allow indeterminate
representations.
the fully specified entries is chosen, it naturally cannot
agree with a constituent which bears a distinct number.
Once utterances like (38) are analyzed as not match-
ing the agreement configuration in (3), it is possible
to handle all the cases of morphological neutralization
discussed in the previous section. Note that the feature
involved in each example of neutralization discussed—
Case in German and French, and definiteness on verbs
in Hungarian—is either inherently formal, without se-
mantic content (Case) or a feature that does not have
any semantic ramification for the category in which it
is neutralized: definiteness does affect the interpretation
of noun phrases, but it serves purely as a formal agree-
ment marker on verbs. If this observation is correct,
then the solution to the apparent paradox runs along
the following lines:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9777412">
• Syntactic features which have semantic rarnifica-
dons, such as number on nouns, tense on verbs,
degree on adjectives, are never neutralized (under-
specified). They are always fully specified and
items which seem to be underspecified with re-
gard to them are, in fact, ambiguous items with
distinct, fully specified representations. (But see
the discussion in the Section 4.)
• Purely formal syntactic features, on the other hand,
can be neutralized, producing truly underspecified
representations, either through the use of value dis-
junction or through the use of a variable, rather
than a constant, as a feature value.6
• Agreement is effected not by unification but rather
by a non-distinctness check.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9711405">
That is, since we can view unification as logically
composed of two parts—variable checking and variable
substitution—agreement should be analyzed as involv-
ing only variable-matching, but not variable substitu-
tion. This would explain why constituents that neutral-
ize a syntactic feature distinction are universally able to
behave as if they are simultaneously marked for all the
values of the feature that they neutralize: since agree-
ment only involves variable matching, but not variable
substitution, the original, underspecified representation
is always available for agreement.
To make this proposal clearer, I will present an
analysis of the German and Hungarian facts,7 using a

erator, which introduces disjunctions of variable-free
tCITILS.S
These representations are matched by a non-
distinctness check, which performs the same tests as
unification. However, the non-distinctness check dif-
fers from unification in what it returns. Unification,
when applied to two eiressions, typically returns ei-
ther a distinguished symbol, such as Fail, if they do not
unify, or a single substitution expression, which is the
most general unifier of its input; see e.g. Pereira and
Shieber (1987, pp. 63-64). When two expressions are
identical, this substitution expression is empty, since no
substitutions need to be performed. In this case, then,
unification effectively leaves its input unchanged. Thus,
unification can be viewed as returning a single indicator
of failure and an unbounded set of substitution expres-
sions. Non-distinctness checicing, on the other hand,
returns a single indicator of failure but also a single
indicator of success—an empty substitution expression.
Alternatively, non-distinctness checking may be view-
ing as determining that two expressions are unifiable,
without actually unifying them.
The following table contrasts the behavior of unifi-
cation (LI) and non-distinctness
property of structures instead: however, the Case specification of the
appropriate structure would be the same as hem. A similar consider-
ation holds for Hungarian, where the property of a direct sentential
complement triggering definite verb agreement might be either a lex-
ical or structural property.

In examples (4) and (5) in German, and (16)—
(19) in Hungarian, clause 1 applies. Since the terms
involved in the agreements in all these examples are
variable-free, the results are identical under the unifi-
cation and non-distinctness analyses. In the German
examples (6) and (7), which involve was, daises 4 and
5 are the relevant ones, and it is here that the difference
between the unification approach to agreement and the
non-distinctness approach is apparent. Under the unifi-
cation approach, once the disjunctive Case feature value
associated with was unifies with a fully specified Case
feature, a substitution list is produced that replaces the
disjunction with one of its values:

<bodyText confidence="0.76856925">
On the other hand, the non-distinctness check returns a
null subsitution, so that the disjunction remains, allow-
ing the Case feature of was to agree with distinct values
of Case on different applications of non-distinctness.

9Note that this is an extension of the standard conception of sub-
stitution, in systems without disjunction, in which a term substitutes
for a variable, but not for a variable-free term. However, the addition
of disjunction requites such an extension.

A similar analysis holds for examples (20) and (21)
in Hungarian; in these cases, it is clause 2 which is
relevant.
The treatment of the conjoined verb phrase facts in
Section 2.3 is analogous to that of the cases already dis-
cussed. However, one point is worth discussing here.
It has not yet been made clear how it is that the object
of the conjoined verb phrase is able to agree separately
with each verb in the conjunct. While it might be pos-
sible to handle this mechanically by postulating some
special percolation rule that combines the features of
the conjuncts together into some underspecified or dis-
junctive form, there is a much more straightforward
solution, namely, to postulate that the examples in Sec-
tion 2.3 are generated by ellipsis. Certainly, given the
strong lexical thrust of recent grammatical frameworks,
in which syntactic structures, such as verbal comple-
ment structures, are projected from lexical representa-
tions, it is hard to see how such examples could not be
analyzed as cases of ellipsis, at least in configurational
languages. Thus, example (28) would be analyzed as
in (42) rather than (41).

In non-configurational languages, since comple-
ments may not be localized in any fixed position, some
other mechanism for associating a head with its com-
plements is needed, independent of these neutralization
facts. In an active-objects approach to syntax, such as
that outlined in Ingria and Pustejovsk-y (1990), message-
passing would be the logical way of associating a head
with its complements and would extend to the conjunc-
tion cases, as well. In any event, whatever mechanism
is operative in the non-conjunctive case should also ap-
ply to the conjoined case.

This paper is not the first to consider the problem that
neutralization facts pose for theories of agreement. In
particular, Zaenen and Karttunen (1984) and PuIlum
and Zwicky (1986) consider data of the type presented
in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. However, the analysis of agree-
ment proposed here seems more general in a number of
ways.

While the earlier analyses only considered neutral-
ization in the context of conjoined structures, as in Sec-
tions 2.3 and 2.4, this paper has examined the problem
in general. In particular, the solutions proposed by Za-
enen and ICartrunen and Pullum and Zwicky crucially
depend on the neutralized item standing in an agreement
relation with a conjunction and, hence, cannot extend to
cases of neutralization that do not involve conjunction.
While Zaenen and Karttunen and Pull= and
Zwicky agree with the present analysis in associating
the neutralized constistuent with each conjunct of the
conjunction directly, rather than through the conjunc-
tion as a whole, both of their analyses require this asso-
ciation to be stated as a separate principle. If the brief
sketch presented at the end of the preceding section is
correct, no such stipulation is necessary. Rather, the
behavior of neutralization with respect to conjunction
follows from the interaction of the general agreement
procedure with the way in which heads are associated
with their complements.
Zaenen and Karttunen leave the bulk of the ques-
tion of what features can be neutralized as a research
topic. Pullum and Zwicky, on the other hand, limit
neutralization to those features imposed by agreement.
This is essentially the position argued for here, although
there are subtle differences between the two proposals
and some problematic data (which we will return to in
Section 4). However, this proposal does seem to be
fundamentally correct, and, combined with the view of
agreement as non-distinctness, yields a more empiri-
cally valid theory of agreement than one which equates
unification with agreement or which limits the effects
of neutralization to conjoined structures.
Moreover, this view of agreement should contribute
to the portability of natural language systems across
languages. While it might be possible to reconcile the
type of agreement behavior discussed here with a for-
malism in which unification is used for agreement by
the use of arrays of feature values or some even more
byzantine mechanism, such an approach would increase
the fragility of any system embodying it. In a theory
such as the one here, it should be possible to distin-
guish cases of ambiguity from cases of neutralization
straightforwardly and to assign the appropriate repre-
sentation accordingly. In a system that tried to maintain
the use of unification for agreement by means of elab-
orated representations, the designer of a grammar for a
new language would be faced with the problem of either
using the elaborated representation for all cases of mor-
phological underspecification, and, perhaps, blowing up
the size and complexity of the grammar, or reserving

the elaborated representation for just those forms which
enter into an agreement relation. This would require a
thorough study of all the morphological forms of the
language and the constructions they enter into before
feature structures could be designed and might entail
large scale changes later if previously unnoticed cases
of neutralization were discovered.

3.3 The Place of Unification in Grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99481371875">
The proposal that agreement is not effected by unifica-
tion does not, however, mean that unification plays no
role in grammar. On the contrary: in most complex-
feature based systems, semantic features are also full-
fledged parts of syntactic representations and unifica-
tion is used to build up more complex terms out of
simpler or less specified terms and to build up formu-
las out of terms.&amp;quot; There is no argument at all in the
data presented here that unification does not continue
to play this role. In fact, there is a certain histori-
cal niceness in the picture of grammar that has been
developed here: variable matching (non-distinctness) is
used to effect agreement, and variable substitution (uni-
fication) is used to build up semantic representations.
The reason why this view is historically satisfying is
that it corresponds to views of agreement and seman-
tic interpretation that were independently developed in
theoretical and computational linguistics. In the ear-
liest forms of generative grammar, it was recognized
that certain constructions, such as the various types of
ellipsis, depended on a notion of identity. Over the
years, this notion of identity was refined into one of
non-distinctness. Two linguistic representations agree
if they are non-distinct from one another; they do not
need to be identical (see Chomsky (1965, p. 181)).
The view of agreement presented here accords with this
well-established view. The use of unification for build-
ing up semantic representations, in turn, is based on
Robinson&apos;s (1965) work on resolution theorem proving.
Thus, using unification to build up semantic represen-
tations, but not for agreement, returns it to something
close to its original use.
There are two other places where unification may
play a role in grammar, although other mechanisms are
also possibile in these cases. The first is feature per-
colation and the second is the use of empty categories,
such as traces. Whereas agreement has been used here
to mean matching of features between sister nodes, typi-
11See Pereira and Warren (1980), Shieber (1986), and Pereira and
&amp;get= (1987) for more detailed discussion of semantic interpretation
in complex-feature based grammars.
catty of distinct categories, feature-percolation involves
the matching of features between one constituent and
a constituent which it dominates, where the dominat-
ing constituent is a projection of the dominated, in the
sense of the X-Bar theory of phrase structure (Chom-
sky (1970), Jackendoff (1977)). For example, a noun
phrase has the same person and number features as its
head noun, a verb phrase, the tense and mood of its
head verb, etc. Unification has typically been used to
effect feature-percolation and nothing in the data pre-
sented here suggests that it is wrong to use unification
for this purpose. And while the proposal that agreement
and feature-percolation are handled by different mecha-
nisms is not usual in complex-feature based grammars,
it is also not unprecedented. Ross&apos;s (1981) Local Gram-
mar formalism is a complex-feature based grammar in
which feature percolation and agreement are distinct.
Finally, unification has been used to &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; fea-
tures between a &amp;quot;dislocated&amp;quot; element and its trace. Here
again, unification remains a viable mechanism. How-
ever, there are alternatives mechanisms for both these
functions, such as inheritance and delegation, whose
use should probably be investigated.

There are a number of theoretical and practical issues
that the analysis presented here raises. Their discussion
will conclude this paper.
First of all, there is the question of how the non-
distinctness test for agreement can be incorporated into
a system in which unification is used for semantic in-
terpretation and other purposes. Since non-distinctness
returns a subset of the values returned by unifica-
tion, interaction between non-distinctness and unifica-
tion should be straightforward. However, a system us-
ing both these mechanisms would also need to contain
some method for specifying which features of which
constituents are subject to unification and which are
subject to non-distinctness. This suggests the neces-
sity of some sort of type declaration system, in which
features are declared as semantically relevant or not
for a particular category. The BBN ACFG formalism
(Boisen 1989a,b), a form of Definite Clause Grammar,
already includes a type declaration system, which has
proven very useful for maintaining the consistency of
large grammars. It should be possible to extend this
kind of type system to the degree of delicacy required
by a system incorporating both unification and non-
distinctness.

A more problematic issue is the exact specification
of the features which can be neutralized and those which
can be ambiguous, and their contexts. In Section 3.1, it
was suggested that semantically relevant features enter
into ambiguity relations, while all others produce neu-
tralization. However, the notion of semantic relevance
may need to be refined. Zaenen and ICartunnen (1984)
produce examples such as the following:
(43) der Antrag des oder der Dozenten
the petition the or the docent(s)
SG PL GEN-SG/GEN-FL
&apos;the petition of the docent or docents&apos;

&apos;I have seen the docent and helped the docents.&apos;
Example (44), which by the account presented here
would involve the attempted neutralization of number,
a semantically relevant feature, is ungrammatical, just
as is predicted. However, (43), which also seems to
involve the attempted neutralization of number, is un-
expectedly grammatical. Zaenen and Karttunen also
present an example from Finnish parallel to (43):
(45) He lukivat letnen uusimman _ ja

`They read his newest book and we his best books.&apos;
Here again, number, a semantically relevant feature,
appears to be neutralized. Although Zaenen and Kart-
ttmen &apos;s treatment of neutralization is different from that
suggested here is several respects, they suggest a cru-
cial difference between (43) and (45) on the one hand
and (44) on the other that may carry over. In (44), the
constitutent level at which neutralization is attempted is
that of the phrase (NP), whereas in (43) and (45) it is at
the level of the pre-terminal (N). Zaenen and Karttunen
(1984, p. 517) suggest that the neutralization is possible
at the one level but not the other because &amp;quot;reference is
assigned to noun phrases, not to common nouns.&amp;quot; Or,
in the terms we have been using here, number is se-
mantically relevant for noun phrases, but not nouns.12
Clearly, more research needs to be done to detemnne
12Irt our work on the BBN ACFG system (Boisen 1989a,b), we
have also found that features such as number, degree, and tense seem
to have their semantic effect at the phrasal level. rather than that of
if the proposed distinction is valid or not. Moreover, if
it is valid, the theory of feature percolation needs to be
modified to allow number to be neutralized at the level
of N, but to produce ambiguity at the level of NP.
Finally, one issue that has not yet been mentioned
is that of speaker preferences. While the discussion
in Section 2 treated constructions involving the neu-
tralized forms as perfectly grammatical, variation in
speaker judgement has been reported. Thus, Zaenen and
Karttunen (1984) comment that some Icelandic speak-
ers reject (30b) as well as (30a). Pullum and Zwicky
(1986) present similar sorts of judgements for other con-
structions. Moreover, there are also judgements in the
opposite direction. For example, Modern Greek, unlike
German, does not require that the relative pronoun in a
free relative clause have a Case compatible with both its
source and superficial positions; see, for example Mack-
ridge (1985, pp. 259ft) for discussion. This means
that the Modem Greek equivalents of (4b) and (5h) are
grammatical. Nevertheless, some speakers13, while ac-
cepting such sentences as grammatical, report that sen-
tences containing a free relative pronoun which neu-
tralizes the abstract Case conflict are somewhat more
acceptable. These facts set us a broader research goal:
that of proposing a theory of agreement which does not
produce simple binary grammaticality statements but
one which is capable of estimating degrees of relative
grammaticality. Since the necessity of such a finer-
grained theory of grammaticality is becoming more and
more obvious in computational linguistics as a whole,
it is no surprise to find it appearing in the study of
agreement, as well.

<abstract confidence="0.999599461538461">Current complex-feature based grammars use a single procedure—unification—for a multitude of purposes, among them, enforcing formal agreement between purely syntactic features. This paper presents evidence from several natural languages that unification—variable-matching combined with variable substitution—is the wrong mechanism for effecting agreement. The view of grammar developed here is one in which unification is used for semantic interpretation, while purely formal agreement involves only a check for non-distinctness—i.e. variable-matching without variable substitution.</abstract>

Rather, the argument will go, using unification to effect agreement is incorrect both for theoretical reasons—it presents a view of language which is contradicted by the facts—and for practical reasons—using unification to effect agreement can impede a system&apos;s robustness and transportability. 2 The Paradox A typical paradigm that is presented to show the almost transparent application of unification to agreement phenomena is the following: (1) a. &apos;The sheep is ready. b. The sheep are ready. c. The sheep is there. d. The sheep are there. e. *The sheep that is ready are there. 194 Sentences (10 through (1d) are taken to indicate that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; is underspecified with regard to number, it can be either singular or plural. (le), on the other hand, shows that &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; cannot be both singular and plural at the same time. In the relative clause, &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; is marked as singular, and &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot;, interpreted as its subject via the relative connector &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, must also be singular.

The process of subject-verb agreement is effected by unification. Therefore, when &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; appears as the subject of a finite verb, unification will fix its number as singular or plural (unless the finite verb itself is ambiguous).

Thus, this schema indicates that a category which is specified for the values a and 3 for feature F cannot simultaneously agree in this feature with categories that specify distinct values for F. In the rest of this section, I will show eases of constructions which match this schema but are still grammatical. 2.1 Case 1: German Free Relatives In German, as Groos and van Riemsdijk (1979) demonstrate, free relative clauses require that t</context>

However, the neuter free relative pronoun was, which is both nominative and accusative, can seemingly agree with both nominative and accusative Case assigning elements at the same time: (6) Was du mix gegeben hest, ist prachtig. What you me given have is wonderful NOM/ACC ACC NOM &apos;What you have given to me is wonderful.&apos; (7) Ich habe gegessen was noch (brig war. I have eaten what still left was ACC NOM/ACC NOM &apos;I ate what was left.&apos; Note that sentences (6) and (7) are precisely instances of schema (3), just as (1e) is. Hence, if the explanation of the ungrammaticality of (le) is correct, we should expect (6) and (7) to be ungrammatical. (8) a_ [V [case:ACC1] [N [case:{N,AM [V [case:NOM]] (&amp;quot;gegeben&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;was&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;1st&amp;quot;) b.

We can then </context>
<context position="9755" citStr="(3)" startWordPosition="1615" endWordPosition="1615">ctures or of particular lexical items, would be: (15) a. [case: [nom: TJ] b. (CASE T ?val ?val) This solution works, then, because was, and no other free relative pronouns, specifies the value T for l&apos;This possibility was pointed out to me by Andy Haas. more than one element in its Case array and because verbs and other Case &amp;quot;assigning&amp;quot; elements only specify a value for the Case they &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot;, and for no others. This solution of factoring out seemingly contradictory values for a single feature into values of different features allows us to get around the superficial violation of the schema in (3). However, there are other constructions which are harder to decompose in this fashion. 2.2 Case 2: Hungarian WH Movement and Topicalimtion Let us now turn to a more complicated example, from Hungarian, described in Szamosi (1976). In Hungarian, WH words, like full NPs, are marked as either definite or indefinite. The verb in Hungarian is also marked as definite or indefinite, in agreement with its complement. When the complement is an accusative noun phrase, the definiteness marking on verb and noun phrase is the same. (16) a. Akart egy kdnyvet. he-wanted a book —DEF —DEF b. *Akarta egy konyv</context>
<context position="12557" citStr="(3)" startWordPosition="2094" endWordPosition="2094">lized NP can only be definite. This is shown in the following examples: However, certain Hungarian verb forms4 bear an ending which is ambiguous between definite and indefinite. In sentences involving such verbs, the WH word may be indefinite. (20) A kOnyv unit akarnink, bogy elhozzon. the hook which we-would-want that he-brings –DEF ±DEF +DEF –DEF &apos;The book which we would want him to bring.&apos; (21) Egy konyv akartam, hogy elhozzon. a book I-wanted that he-brings –DEF ±DEF +DEF –DEF &apos;It was a book that I wanted him to bring.&apos; Once again, the grammatical (20) and (21) match the prohibited schema (3) (&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;complementizer&amp;quot;): (22) a. [N [def:–] [V [der.{+, –}] [c [def:+] (&amp;quot;amit&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;akarridnk&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;hogy&amp;quot;) 31&apos;he situation is actually somewhat more complex; see Szamosi 0976) for Mi details. 4The first person singular past indicative and the first person plural present conditional. b. [NT&apos; [clef:–] [V [def:{+,--}] [c [def:+1 (&amp;quot;egy kbnyv&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;akartam&amp;quot;) (&amp;quot;hogy&amp;quot;) Let us consider the consequences of expanding out the definiteness feature into an array of separate values, analogous to the German example. First, this would require the underspecified verb forms to be represented as in (23). (23) alcamd</context>
<context position="14581" citStr="(3)" startWordPosition="2399" endWordPosition="2399"> as uniquely definite or indefinite, as is consistent with its overt marking, and not as ambiguous between definite and indefinite, as the proposed unification analysis would require. Thus, this unification based solution to a problem of a morphological ambiguity entails an ambiguity of interpretation that is not attested. Moreover, aside from the empirically incorrect predictions about semantic interpretation, there is a more fundamental problem with the unification account of agreement. As was pointed out above, treating agreement as unification implies that structures meeting the schema in (3) should be superficially ungrammatical. In fact, this seems to be universally false: in every case in natural language in which an element does not morphologically distinguish between two or more values of a feature—a situation often referred to as morphological neutralization—it behaves as if this distinction is also neutralized for purposes of agreement. That is, instead of the configuration in (3) being universally ruled out, 197 it is universally attested. This creates a paradox, since the ungrammaticality of (le) seems to depend on the ungrammaticality of structures matching the configura</context>

There seems to be evidence, in the form of ungrarnatical utterances such as (le), that the configuration in (3) is ungrammatical. However, the rest of the section presented evidence from different constructions and different languages which strongly indicates that (3) is the standard agreement configuration throughout the languages of the world. In this section, I will resolve this paradox by proposing that agreement is not effected by unification and but rather by a test for non-distinctness of feature values. 3.1 Neutralization versus Ambiguity First, let us return to example (le), repeated here for convenience (38) *The sheep that is ready are there. Recall that the analysis of this utterance which </context>
<context position="21050" citStr="(3)" startWordPosition="3483" endWordPosition="3483">n encountered and once one of 3Nothing in the present argument hinges on this being the correct treatment of the singular/plural distinction. It does not matter which of the various proposals about the semantic interpretation of number is chosen. All that matters is that semantic theories require that singular and plural have different denotations, and do not allow indeterminate representations. the fully specified entries is chosen, it naturally cannot agree with a constituent which bears a distinct number. Once utterances like (38) are analyzed as not matching the agreement configuration in (3), it is possible to handle all the cases of morphological neutralization discussed in the previous section. Note that the feature involved in each example of neutralization discussed— Case in German and French, and definiteness on verbs in Hungarian—is either inherently formal, without semantic content (Case) or a feature that does not have any semantic ramification for the category in which it is neutralized: definiteness does affect the interpretation of noun phrases, but it serves purely as a formal agreement marker on verbs.

However, there are other constructions which are harder to decompose in this fashion. 2.2 Case 2: Hungarian WH Movement and Topicalimtion Let us now turn to a more complicated example, from Hungarian, described in Szamosi (1976). In Hungarian, WH words, like full NPs, are marked as either definite or indefinite. The verb in Hungarian is also marked as definite or indefinite, in agreement with its complement. When the complement is an accusative noun phrase, the definiteness marking on verb and noun phrase is the same. (16) a.

In the German examples (6) and (7), which involve was, daises 4 and 5 are the relevant ones, and it is here that the difference between the unification approach to agreement and the non-distinctness approach is apparent. Under the unification approach, once the disjunctive Case feature value associated with was unifies with a fully specified Case feature, a substitution list is produced that replaces </context>

This is shown in the following examples: However, certain Hungarian verb forms4 bear an ending which is ambiguous between definite and indefinite.
