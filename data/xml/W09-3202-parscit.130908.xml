Archaeological excavations in the sites of the
Indus Valley civilization (2500-1900 BCE) in
Pakistan and northwestern India have un-
earthed a large number of artifacts with in-
scriptions made up of hundreds of distinct
signs. To date, there is no generally accepted
decipherment of these sign sequences, and
there have been suggestions that the signs
could be non-linguistic. Here we apply com-
plex network analysis techniques on the data-
base of available Indus inscriptions, with the
aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntac-
tic structure in this sign system. Our results
show the presence of regularities, e.g., in the
segmentation trees of the sequences, that sug-
gest the existence of a grammar underlying the
construction of the sequences.

The recent interest in complex networks among
physicists over the past few years has meant that
the graph theoretic paradigm has been applied to
many different areas, including networks defined
in corpora of textual units (Mehler, 2008), and
has often revealed hitherto unsuspected patterns.
While graph-based representation of texts had
been used for some time in natural language

biguation and clustering (Radev and Mihalcea,
2008), the approach based on the new physics of
complex networks often asks questions from a
different perspective that can shed new light on
the organization of linguistic structure. For ex-
ample, networks constructed on the basis of co-
occurrence of words in sentences have been seen
to exhibit the small-world effect, i.e., a small av-
erage distance between any pair of arbitrarily
chosen words, and, a scale-free distribution of
the number of words a given word is connected
to (i.e., its degree) (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole,
2001). These properties have been proposed to
reflect the evolutionary history of lexicons and
the origin of their flexibility and combinatorial
nature. Note that, a recent study of a lexical net-
work of words that are phonological neighbors
has found that the degree distribution might be
better fit by an exponential rather than a power-
law function (Vitevitch, 2008). A theoretical
model for such word co-occurrence network,
which treats language as a self-organizing net-
work of interacting words, has led to the sugges-
tion that languages may have a core (the “kernel
lexicon”) that does not vary as the language
evolves (Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001). How-
ever, even though text and speech are sequential,
the local correlation between immediately con-
secutive words may not describe natural lan-
guages well – due to the presence of non-local
relations between words that occur apart from
each other in a sentence. Therefore, network

analysis has been extended to syntactic depend-
ency networks, where two words are connected if
they have been related syntactically in a number
of sentences (Ferrer i Cancho et al, 2003). The
theory of complex networks has also been used
to investigate the structure of meaningful con-
cepts in the written texts of individual authors,
which have been seen to have small-world as
well as scale-free characteristics (Caldeira et al,
2006). The conceptual network of a language has
been explored by using the semantic relatedness
of words as defined by a thesaurus, and this net-
work too is seen to have small-world nature with
scale-free degree distribution (Motter et al,
2002).
In this article, we look at a corpus of inscriptions
obtained through archaeological excavations car-
ried out in the ruins of the Indus valley civiliza-
tion. The sequences comprise signs, of which
there are more than four hundred unique and dis-
tinct types. Since discovery in the early part of
the 20th century, there have been attempts at de-
ciphering them. However, to date there is no
generally accepted method of interpreting these
inscriptions. We analyze a representative data-
base of these sequences using techniques in-
spired by complex network theory. Our aim is to
see whether such methods can reveal the exis-
tence of patterns suggesting syntactic organiza-
tion in the sign sequences. In the next section, we
briefly introduce the historical context of the In-
dus inscriptions, while in Section 3, we discuss
the dataset on which analysis has been carried
out. Our results are reported in Section 4, and we
finally conclude with a discussion of unresolved
questions and further work that needs to be car-
ried out.

2 The Indus inscriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950837209303">
The Indus civilization, also known as the Mature
Harappan civilization (2500-1900 BCE), was
geographically spread over what is now Pakistan
and northwestern India, covering approximately
a million square kilometers (Possehl, 2002). It
was marked by urbanization centered around
large planned cities, as evidenced in the ruins of
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Craft specialization
and long-distance trade with Mesopotamia and
Central Asia have been well-demonstrated. This
civilization came to an end early in the 2nd mil-
lennium BC. There were no historical records of
its existence until archaeological excavations in
the late 19th and early 20th century uncovered
artifacts, and some of the ruined urban centers
(Marshall, 1931).
Among the artifacts uncovered during these dis-
coveries were a variety of objects (especially
seals) that were inscribed with a variety of signs
arranged in sequences (Fig. 1). Although found
primarily on seals and their impressions (seal-
ings), inscriptions with similar signs have also
been discovered on miniature tablets, pottery,
copper tablets, bronze implements, etc. Unsur-
prisingly, given the high sophistication of the
civilization and the level of social complexity it
implies, with the concomitant requirements of
coordination and communication, these inscrip-
tions have been interpreted as corresponding to
writing. However, despite periodic claims about
decipherment of this writing system, there has as
yet been no generally accepted interpretation of
the signs. The failure of decipherment is partly
due to lack of knowledge about the language
which the signs encode and the lack of any bilin-
gual texts such as the Rosetta stone which was
crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.
While there is disagreement on the exact number
of unique and distinct signs that occur in the in-
scriptions, there is overall agreement that they lie
in the range of a few hundred. This rules out the
possibility of the signs belonging either to an
alphabetic system, which contains on average

about 25 letters (such as English) or an ideo-
graphic (e.g., Chinese) writing system, compris-
ing more than 50,000 characters. The brevity of
the inscriptions (the longest that occurs on a sin-
gle line has 14 signs) and the existence of a large
number of signs that occur with very low fre-
quency have led to some alternative suggestions
regarding the meaning of the sign sequences.
These include the possibilities that, e.g., (i) the
signs correspond to a label specifying an indi-
vidual and his belongings, in the manner of he-
raldic badges (Fairservis, 1971) and (ii) the signs
are ritual or religious symbols which do not en-
code speech nor serve as mnemonic devices,
much as the Vinca signs or emblems in Near
Eastern artifacts (Farmer et al, 2004). The latter
possibility implies the absence of any syntactic
structure in the Indus inscriptions, a possibility
that can be tested without making any a priori
assumptions about the meaning of the signs.

3 Description of dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999204">
The database for Indus sign sequences that we
have used is based on the electronic concordance
constructed by Mahadevan (1977), referred here
as M77. This is based on the study of a total of
3573 sequences recorded from 2906 distinct arti-
facts and it identifies 417 unique signs. In the
following we identify each sign in a sign se-
quence by its corresponding identification num-
ber (1, ..., 417) in M77. Most of the inscriptions
seem to have been written from right to left.
However, according to the convention we use,
the sequence of numbers representing each text
is read from left to right (i.e., the leftmost num-
ber in the sequence is read as the first sign in the
inscription). Yadav et al (2008) have constructed

preceding sign to a sign that follows it in the cor-

are weighted by the frequency of occurrence of
that particular sign pair.

an Extended Basic Unique Data Set (EBUDS) by
removing from M77 all sequences that are in-
complete, because of the presence of signs that
are damaged, lost, illegible or not unambiguously
identified. Further, only sequences which are
written on a single line are retained. This is to
remove the ambiguity regarding the interpreta-
tion of sequences with multiple lines, namely,
whether the different lines should be considered
as independent sequences or whether they form
one continuous sequence. Moreover, if the same
sequence is found in multiple artifacts, it is rep-
resented only once in EBUDS. Following these
operations, the original number of 3573 se-
quences in M77 is reduced to 1548 sequences in
EBUDS. Moreover, 40 of the 417 unique signs in
M77, which occur with relatively very low fre-
quency, do not have any representation in
EBUDS – so that latter dataset comprises 377
unique signs. However, it has been verified by
Yadav et al (2008) that the frequency distribu-
tions of signs in the two datasets are qualitatively
similar.

4.1 The directed network of signs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874586206897">
To have a graphical view of the entire sign sys-
tem, we first construct the directed network of
Indus signs (Fig. 2). This has 377 nodes corre-
sponding to the distinct, uniquely identified
signs. Node i has a directed link to node j, if sign
j immediately follows sign i in any of the inscrip-
tions included in EBUDS. The link between i
and j is weighted by the frequency of occurrence
of *ij* in the corpus (“*” is a wildcard character
that may be substituted by any of the 377 signs
or blank space).
We note immediately that only 1.5% (=2178) of
the 377×377 possible directed pairs are seen to
occur in the actual inscriptions. Furthermore,
most of the signs are connected to only one or
two other signs. The connectance (probability of
link between any given pair) is only around 0.01,
implying that the network is extremely sparse.
However, if we plot the sub-network of connec-
tions between nodes corresponding to the 10 mo-
st common signs in EBUDS (i.e., the ones occur-
ring with the highest frequency), we note that
they are strongly inter-connected (Fig. 3). There-
fore the adjacency matrix of the sign network is
far from homogeneous, with patches of dense
connectivity in certain regions.
As the above evidence indicates that there exists
a core set of signs which occur very frequently as
pairs, a natural question is whether the network

generated from EBUDS has a core-periphery
organization. This would imply the existence of a
densely connected central core (central in terms
of graph distance) and a larger class of sparsely
connected peripheral nodes, like that seen in the
case of geographically embedded transportation
networks (Holme, 2005). To obtain such a de-
composition of the network we use a pruning
algorithm that successively peels away layers of
a given core-order of the network. The k-core of
a network is defined as the subnetwork contain-
ing all nodes that have degree at least equal to k.
Thus, to obtain it, we have to iteratively remove
all nodes having degree less than k. In particular,
the 2-core of a network is obtained by eliminat-
ing all nodes that do not form part of a loop (i.e.,
a closed path through a subset of the connected
nodes). For a k-core, there exist at least k paths
between any pair of nodes belonging to it. It is
obvious that for any network, there exists an in-
nermost core of maximum order which cannot
exceed the highest degree of the network.
In a directed network, one can define a k-core
either in terms of the in-degree (number of con-
nections arriving at the node) or the out-degree
(number of connections sent from the node). For
the EBUDS network, the innermost core turns
out to have order 8, regardless of the type of
network considered (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the
innermost core for the in-degree network. Even a
casual inspection shows that many of the com-
mon sign pairs in the database belong to this
subnetwork. Thus, a large part of the corpus can

4.2 Modularity of the network
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957571428571">
Many networks that we see in nature are modu-
lar, i.e., they comprise several subnetworks (of-
ten called communities) whose members are
more densely connected to each other than with
the rest of the network. In several systems, such
structural modules are often associated with
functional modularity, with each community be-
ing identified as being responsible for certain
specific functions (e.g., in the protein interaction
network). In the EBUDS network, existence of
modules will imply that certain sets of signs oc-
cur together far more often than would be ex-
pected had their frequencies of appearance in the
corpus been statistically independent.
The unambiguous identification of communities
in a network is a problem that still has not been
solved to complete satisfaction. However, sev-
eral near-optimal algorithms exist. The technique
we use was proposed in Newman and Girvan
(2004) and involves calculating the following
measure of modularity of a network:

The large deviation of the empirical value of the
pair occurrence probability from the randomized
corpus indicates that this is a statistically signifi-
cant sign pair.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998906060606">
nition, this gives a large value when the network
has an unambiguous partition into several com-
munities. Thus, the method for finding the mod-
ules involves carrying out many trial divisions of
the network into modules and calculating the
corresponding Q. The partition for which Q is
maximum will correspond to the true modular
partition of the system. Needless to say, a brute
force method for finding the best partition is im-
possible for modest sized networks, and we use
an extremal optimization technique for this pur-
pose. We obtain 8 communities whose sizes
range from 6 to 87 nodes.
Having identified the communities in the sign
network, the obvious question is whether they
correspond to sign groups that occur in a particu-
lar context, e.g., commercial or religious. With
this aim in view we have examined the correla-
tion between the modules and (i) artifact types,
(ii) nature of the field symbols and (iii) site of
excavation. None of them show any significant
correlation with the modules, implying that the
signs are not simple attributes of either artifact or
symbol portrayed in a seal, nor were the use of
certain sign subsets confined exclusively to cer-
tain regions. The latter point underlines the sur-
prising homogeneity of sign usage over the vast
area that the Indus civilization covered. Let us
stress that we are looking at correlation between
groups of signs (that have a strong probability of
co-occurrence) and specific contexts, rather than
the significant frequency of occurrence of an in-
dividual sign in a specific context, of which there

patterns at the level of groups of signs, rather
than individual signs, we aim to arrive at results

4.3 Network of “significant” links
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997996875">
So far we had placed all sign pairs that occur in
EBUDS on an equal footing. However, certain
pairs may occur with high probability simply
because the individual signs that make up the
pair occur with high frequency. Fig. 6 shows that
the frequency distribution of sign occurrence in
EBUDS has an approximately power law distri-
bution. This implies that the few commonest
signs will occur over a very large number of
cases (the most frequent sign appearing as many
as 715 times, which is 10% of the total of 7000
occurrences of the 377 signs in EBUDS). By us-
ing the information about the probability of oc-
currence for individual signs in EBUDS we can
investigate significant sign relations, i.e., sign
combinations that occur far more frequently than
that expected from the individual probabilities of
the component signs.
Thus, if sign i occurs with a probability p(i) and j
with p(j), then the pair ij is significant if p(ij) &gt;&gt;
p(i)p(j). To measure by how much p(ij) has to be
larger than the product of p(i) and p(j) in order to
be “significant”, we need to compare the empiri-
cal joint occurrence probability against the corre-
sponding value for randomized surrogates. The
randomized corpus is generated by shuffling the
sign sequences in the dataset so that, while the
individual sign frequencies are unchanged, all
pair correlations in the original inscriptions are
lost. The shuffling can be done over either (i) the
entire corpus, or (ii) over each individual seal.
Fig. 7 shows a comparison between the empirical
probability of a certain significant sign pair, and
the corresponding probability distribution ob-
tained upon corpus randomization. It is evident
that the pair would never have been observed
with the actual EBUDS frequency had the two
signs been independent, i.e., had there been no
dependency relation between them. This devia-
tion can be quantified by computing the z-score,
which is the difference between the empirical
sign pair probability and the mean of the ran-
domized cases, divided by the standard deviation
for the randomizations. The distribution of z-
scores for all 377×377 possible pairs are shown
in Fig. 8. We note that there are 284 sign pairs
with z-score larger than 10, while 46 pairs have
z-score more than 20.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952285714286">
We will finally attempt to reveal structure indica-
tive of syntactic trees by “parsing” the longest
sign sequences. We do this by generating seg-
mentation trees of the sign sequences based on
the relative frequency of sign combination occur-
rences. Given a inscription of length n, sign pairs
are iteratively merged to form meta-signs, with
the first merge being done for the sign pair with
the highest z-score among all pairs in that se-
quence. This merged sign is then included as a
meta-sign and assigned a new number. The re-
duced sequence of length n-1 is now again
scanned for the pair of signs or meta-signs that is
most “significant” and merged together. This
process continues until the entire sign sequence
reduces to a single meta-sign. In case of a tie be-
tween two or more pairs at any stage, one pair is
randomly chosen. The resulting segmentation
tree of the sign sequence is shown schematically
in Fig. 10. The height of the tree is an indicator
of the presence of significant recursive structure

in the sign sequence. In particular, if the signs
are all independent of each other, then the seg-
mentation tree has essentially the same height as
the length of the sequence (Fig. 10, top). On the
other hand, if for long sequences, there exists
subsequences that also appear in the corpus as
separate sequences in their own right, this is in-
dicative of recursion. The corresponding tree
height is substantially reduced as compared to
the sequence length (Fig. 10, bottom).
We use this criterion to seek signature of recur-
sive, and hence syntactic, structure in the
EBUDS network. For shorter length sequences, it
becomes difficult to obtain subsequences that
also appear as sequences in the database. We
have thus confined our attention to inscriptions
having 10 or more signs. Arranging the heights
of the segmentation trees of these sequences in
descending order (for seals of each specific
length), we see that the average tree height is
around 5 (Fig. 11). Such a characteristic length
scale indicates that the longer sequences may
actually be composed of multiple smaller se-
quences, each of which has a particular syntactic
relation among its constituent signs.

In this paper we have used complex network
analysis techniques on the sign network con-
structed from a subset of the corpus of inscrip-
tions obtained in Indus civilization excavations.
Our results suggest that though these sign se-
quences are yet to be deciphered, they have a
highly structured arrangement which is sugges-
tive of the existence of syntax. The inference of a
set of rules (i.e., the grammar) for arranging
these signs in a particular order, so as to be able

to create pseudotexts that are indistinguishable
from the excavated ones is the eventual aim of
the analysis described here. However, prior to
this several open problems need to be addressed.
One of the extensions of the present work has to
do with looking beyond sign pairs to sign trip-
lets, quadruplets, etc. Preliminary analysis of
networks of meta-signs by us indicates that,
combinations beyond four signs may not have
statistical significance. A detailed comparison
between the sign network described here and the
meta-sign network may provide clues about the
possible hierarchical arrangement of subse-
quences in the longer sequences. Evidence of this
is already seen from the construction of segmen-
tation trees of individual sequences based on
relative pair frequencies.
It is also possible that there are non-local correla-
tions between signs in a given inscription. To
analyze this, we need to redefine the links in the
network as being connections between all signs
that occur in the same inscription. Again, pre-
liminary analysis seems to suggest that this does
not provide substantially new results from those
reported here.
Based on the number of distinct signs (more than
400) there have been several suggestions that, as
the number is too high to be an alphabetic system
but too small to be an ideographic system, the
inscriptions could well be written in a logo-
syllabic system. Such a writing system combines
both logograms (morphemic signs) and syllabic
(or phonetic) signs without inherent meaning. In
future work, we plan to investigate the differ-
ences that arise in the network structure of lan-
guages belonging to these very different systems,
in order to make an inference on the nature of the
writing system used in the Indus inscriptions.
One of the most controversial aspects of Indus
decipherment is the question of how many dis-
tinct signs are there. M77 identified 417 signs,
but other researchers have come up with a wide
range of different numbers. Therefore, an impor-
tant open issue that needs to be settled in the fu-
ture is the robustness of these results, with re-
spect to analysis based on another sign list, e.g.,
that created by B. K. Wells (Wells, 2006).
Our analysis of correlations, or rather, the lack
of it, between the modules of the network (i.e.,
groups of signs that have a high probability of
co-occurrence) and contexts such as site of exca-
vation, artifact types and field symbols, indicates
that the patterns seen in the sequence organiza-
tion are intrinsic to the sign usage system and not
so much dependent on the context in which they
arise. This supports the long-held belief that the
signs encode writing, or, at least, proto-writing.

<abstract confidence="0.999776055555555">Archaeological excavations in the sites of the Indus Valley civilization (2500-1900 BCE) in Pakistan and northwestern India have unearthed a large number of artifacts with inscriptions made up of hundreds of distinct signs. To date, there is no generally accepted decipherment of these sign sequences, and there have been suggestions that the signs could be non-linguistic. Here we apply complex network analysis techniques on the database of available Indus inscriptions, with the aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntactic structure in this sign system. Our results show the presence of regularities, e.g., in the segmentation trees of the sequences, that suggest the existence of a grammar underlying the construction of the sequences.</abstract>

Craft specialization and long-distance trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia have been well-demonstrated. This civilization came to an end early in the 2nd millennium BC. There were no historical records of its existence until archaeological excavations in the late 19th and early 20th century uncovered artifacts, and some of the ruined urban centers (Marshall, 1931). Among the artifacts uncovered during these discoveries were a variety of objects (especially seals) that were inscribed with a variety of signs arranged in sequences (Fig. 1). Although found primarily on seals and their impressions (sealings), inscriptions with similar signs have also been discovered on miniature tablets, pottery, copper tablets, bronze implements, etc. Unsurprisingly, given the high sophistication of the civilization and the level of social complexity it implies, with the concomitant requirements of coordination and communication, these inscriptions have been interpreted as</context>

In the EBUDS network, existence of modules will imply that certain sets of signs occur together far more often than would be expected had their frequencies of appearance in the corpus been statistically independent. The unambiguous identification of communities in a network is a problem that still has not been solved to complete satisfaction. However, several near-optimal algorithms exist. The technique we use was proposed in Newman and Girvan (2004) and involves calculating the following measure of modularity of a network: Ls ds zl Q=�s L −(2L) J where, L is the total number of links in the network, Ls is the number of links between nodes within a module s and ds is the sum of the degrees for nodes belonging to module s. By defiFig. 7: The probability of occurrence of the sign pair 267-99 in EBUDS compared against the corresponding distribution for the randomized corpus (obtained by considering a million realizations).

In the next section, we briefly introduce the historical context of the Indus inscriptions, while in Section 3, we discuss the dataset on which analysis has been carried out. Our results are reported in Section 4, and we finally conclude with a discussion of unresolved questions and further work that needs to be carried out. 2 The Indus inscriptions The Indus civilization, also known as the Mature Harappan civilization (2500-1900 BCE), was geographically spread over what is now Pakistan and northwestern India, covering approximately a million square kilometers (Possehl, 2002). It was marked by urbanization centered around large planned cities, as evidenced in the ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Craft specialization and long-distance trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia have been well-demonstrated. This civilization came to an end early in the 2nd millennium BC. There were no historical records of its existence until archaeological excavations in the late 19th and early 20th century uncovered artifacts, and some of the ruined urban centers (Marshall, 1931). Among the artifacts uncovered during these discoveries were a variety of objects (especially seals) tha</context>

For example, networks constructed on the basis of cooccurrence of words in sentences have been seen to exhibit the small-world effect, i.e., a small average distance between any pair of arbitrarily chosen words, and, a scale-free distribution of the number of words a given word is connected to (i.e., its degree) (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, 2001).

These properties have been proposed to reflect the evolutionary history of lexicons and the origin of their flexibility and combinatorial nature. Note that, a recent study of a lexical network of words that are phonological neighbors has found that the degree distribution might be better fit by an exponential rather than a powerlaw function (Vitevitch, 2008). A theoretical model for such word co-occurrence network, which treats language as a self-organizing network of interacting words, has led to the suggestion that languages may have a core (the “kernel lexicon”) that does not vary as the language evolves (Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001). However, even though text and speech are sequential, the local correlation between immediately consecutive words may not describe natural languages well – due to the presence of non-local relations between words that occur apart from each other in a sentence.

One of the most controversial aspects of Indus decipherment is the question of how many distinct signs are there. M77 identified 417 signs, but other researchers have come up with a wide range of different numbers. Therefore, an important open issue that needs to be settled in the future is the robustness of these results, with respect to analysis based on another sign list, e.g., that created by B. K. Wells (Wells, 2006). Our analysis of correlations, or rather, the lack of it, between the modules of the network (i.e., groups of signs that have a high probability of co-occurrence) and contexts such as site of excavation, artifact types and field symbols, indicates that the patterns seen in the sequence organization are intrinsic to the sign usage system and not so much dependent on the context in which they arise. This supports the long-held belief that the signs encode writing, or, at least, proto-writing. Acknowledgments We would like to thank Bryan K. Wells for carefully reading through the manuscript and </context>

This is based on the study of a total of 3573 sequences recorded from 2906 distinct artifacts and it identifies 417 unique signs. In the following we identify each sign in a sign sequence by its corresponding identification number (1, ..., 417) in M77. Most of the inscriptions seem to have been written from right to left. However, according to the convention we use, the sequence of numbers representing each text is read from left to right (i.e., the leftmost number in the sequence is read as the first sign in the inscription). Yadav et al (2008) have constructed Fig. 2: The directed network of 377 distinct Indus signs in EBUDS, with arrows pointing from a preceding sign to a sign that follows it in the corpus of empirically observed sign sequences. Links are weighted by the frequency of occurrence of that particular sign pair. Fig. 3: The subnetwork of connections between the 10 highest frequency signs in EBUDS.

Moreover, if the same sequence is found in multiple artifacts, it is represented only once in EBUDS. Following these operations, the original number of 3573 sequences in M77 is reduced to 1548 sequences in EBUDS. Moreover, 40 of the 417 unique signs in M77, which occur with relatively very low frequency, do not have any representation in EBUDS – so that latter dataset comprises 377 unique signs. However, it has been verified by Yadav et al (2008) that the frequency distributions of signs in the two datasets are qualitatively similar. 4 Results In the following sections we report the results of applying network analysis techniques to the sign sequences in EBUDS. We should note at this point that, the distributions of the in- and out- strengths of all the nodes (i.e., the sum of the weights of the incoming and outgoing links, 7 Fig. 4: Core-decomposition of the undirected and directed networks of Indus signs.
