In the last few years the automatic extraction of definitions from textual data has become a common
research topic in several domains of Natural Language Processing. These include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990383857142857">
• Definition extraction as a methodological resource for fields as different as computational
semantics, information extraction, text mining, ontology development, WEB semantics and e-
learning.
• The conception of definition extraction as a self-challenging task, in particular in computational
lexicography and terminography, fields oriented towards the design and implementation of
electronic tools such as lexical knowledge bases, machine-readable dictionaries, terminological
databases, thesauri, machine translation systems or question-answering systems.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980905">
However, in contrast to the general use of definition extraction in multiple domains, there is no specific
forum for sharing information about methodologies, tools, evaluation techniques or applications related
to this field. Therefore, the goal of this workshop is to provide an opportunity to discuss theoretical and
applied issues regarding definition extraction, such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9996962">
• Contributions concerning the state of the art in definition extraction.
• Concrete applications of definition extraction in scientific or technical fields.
• The newest techniques to recognise and extract definitions candidates from running text using
symbolic or statistical methods.
• Demonstration of computational tools for extracting definitions from large corpora.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997065727272728">
The ten accepted papers report recent research initiatives on the topic of definition extraction and its
applications.
The first paper, A formal scope on the relation between definitions and verbal predications by
C´esar Aguilar and Gerardo Sierra, outline a formal description of grammatical relations found in
definitional contexts in Spanish and describe syntactic patterns relating definitions and predications
and the usefulness of these patterns for the identification of definitions in technical corpora.
In the paper Description and evaluation of a definition extraction system for Spanish language,
Rodrigo Alarc´on, Gerardo Sierra and Carme Bach present a description and evaluation of a pattern-
based approach for definition extraction in Spanish specialised texts based on the search for definitional
verbal patterns related to analytical, extensional, functional and synonymical definitions.
Enriching a lexicographical tool with domain definitions: Problems and solutions by Maria
Barrios, Guadalupe Aguado de Cea y Jos´e ´Angel Ramos describes the problems faced by definition
extraction methods due to poor definition construction and proposes some solutions.
iii
In the paper Extraction of author’s definitions using indexed reference identification, Marc Bertin, Iana
Atanassova and Jean-Pierre Descles explore the establishment of relations between definitions and
authors by using indexed references based on a linguistic ontology for the extraction of definitions
from multilingual corpora of scientific texts.
The paper Evolutionary algorithms for definition extraction, by Claudia Borg, Mike Rosner and
Gordon Pace, explores the use of machine learning methods to extract definitions. It reports the
positive results obtained by the use of genetic programming and genetic algorithms to learn the relative
importance of typical linguistic forms of definitions.
Language independent system for definition extraction: First results using learning algorithms,
by Rosa Del Gaudio and Ant´onio Branco, presents several language-independent approaches to deal
with unbalanced data sets applied to two corpora in different languages for definition extraction using
machine learning algorithms.
Gerard de Melo and Gerhard Weikum’s paper Extracting Sense-Disambiguated Example Sentences
From Parallel Corpora investigates to what extent sense-specific example sentences can be extracted
from parallel corpora using lexical knowledge bases for multiple languages as a sense index to
disambiguate word senses.
In her paper A proposal for a framework to evaluate feature relevance for terminographic definitions,
Selja Sepp¨al¨a proposes a theoretical and methodological terminology framework to evaluate relevant
features obtained from definition extraction procedures for terminographical purposes.
In the paper Linguistic realization of conceptual features in terminographic dictionary definitions,
Esperanza Valero Dom´enech and Amparo Alcina Caudet report the result of manual analysis of
specialised dictionary definitions to identify relevant conceptual features and their linguistic realisation
to extract and generate definitions.
Finally, Eline Westerhout’s paper entitled Definition extraction using linguistic and structural
features presents a promising approach to definition extraction in Dutch using a combination of
linguistic (n-grams, type of article, type of noun) and structural information (layout, position).
We hope that this workshop will provide a forum for interaction among members of different
research communities, a means for participants to increase their knowledge and understanding of the
potential of definition extraction and a means for promoting definition extraction as a consolidated
domain of NLP.
