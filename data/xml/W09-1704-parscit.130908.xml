In this paper we present two approaches to
automatically extract cross-lingual predi-
cate clusters, based on bilingual parallel
corpora and cross-lingual information ex-
traction. We demonstrate how these clus-
ters can be used to improve the NIST
Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) event
extraction task1. We propose a new induc-
tive learning framework to automatically
augment background data for low-
confidence events and then conduct global
inference. Without using any additional
data or accessing the baseline algorithms
this approach obtained significant im-
provement over a state-of-the-art bilingual
(English and Chinese) event extraction sys-
tem.

Event extraction, the ‘classical’ information extrac-
tion (IE) task, has progressed from Message Un-
derstanding Conference (MUC)-style single
template extraction to the more comprehensive
multi-lingual Automatic Content Extraction (ACE)
extraction including more fine-grained types. This
extension has made event extraction more widely
applicable in many NLP tasks including cross-
lingual document retrieval (Hakkani-Tur et al.,
2007) and question answering (Schiffman et al.,
2007). Various supervised learning approaches

have been explored for ACE multi-lingual event
extraction (e.g. Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006;
Hardy et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2008; Chen and Ji,
2009). All of these previous literatures showed that
one main bottleneck of event extraction lies in low
recall. It’s a challenging task to recognize the dif-
ferent forms in which an event may be expressed,
given the limited amount of training data. The goal
of this paper is to improve the performance of a
bilingual (English and Chinese) state-of-the-art
event extraction system without accessing its inter-
nal algorithms or annotating additional data.
As for a separate research theme, extensive
techniques have been used to produce word clus-
ters or paraphrases from large unlabeled corpora
(Brown et al., 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Lee and
Pereira, 1999, Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin
and Pantel, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Pang et al.,
2003). For example, (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005) and (Callison-Burch, 2008) described a
method to extract paraphrases from largely avail-
able bilingual corpora. The resulting clusters con-
tain words with similar semantic information and
therefore can be useful to augment a small amount
of annotated data. We will automatically extract
cross-lingual predicate clusters using two different
approaches based on bilingual parallel corpora and
cross-lingual IE respectively; and then use the de-
rived clusters to improve event extraction.
We propose a new learning method called in-
ductive learning to exploit the derived predicate
clusters. For each test document, a background
document is constructed by gradually replacing the
low-confidence events with the predicates in the
same cluster. Then we conduct cross-document
inference technique as described in (Ji and Grish-

matches the procedure of human knowledge acqui-

2 Terminology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985012259259259">
The event extraction task we are addressing is that
of ACE evaluations. ACE defines the following
terminology:
entity: an object or a set of objects in one of the
semantic categories of interest
mention: a reference to an entity (typically, a
noun phrase)
event trigger: the main word which most clearly
expresses an event occurrence
event arguments: the mentions that are in-
volved in an event (participants)
event mention: a phrase or sentence within
which an event is described, including trigger
and arguments
The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events,
with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we
will treat these simply as 33 distinct event types.
For example, for a sentence “Barry Diller on
Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi Universal En-
tertainment”, the event extractor should detect all
the following information: a “Personnel_End-
Position” event mention, with “quit” as the trigger
word, “chief” as an argument with a role of “posi-
tion”, “Barry Diller” as the person who quit the
position, “Vivendi Universal Entertainment” as the
organization, and the time during which the event
happened is “Wednesday”.

4 Cross-lingual Predicate Cluster Acqui-
sition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999465">
We start from two different approaches to extract
cross-lingual predicate clusters, based on parallel
corpora and cross-lingual IE techniques respec-
tively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.850371">
4.1 Acquisition from Bilingual Parallel Cor-
pora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999550652173913">
In the first approach, we take use of the 852 Chi-
nese event trigger words in ACE05 training cor-
pora as our ‘anchor set’. For each Chinese trigger,
we search its automatically aligned English words
from a Chinese-English parallel corpus including
50,000 sentence pairs (part of Global Autonomous
Language Exploitation Y3 Machine Translation
training corpora) to construct an English predicate
cluster. The word alignment was obtained by run-
ning Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003). In each cluster
we record the frequency of each unique English
word. Then we conduct the same procedure in the
other direction to construct Chinese predicate clus-
ters anchored by English triggers.
State-of-the-art Chinese-English word alignment
error rate is about 40% (Deng and Byrne, 2005).
Therefore the resulting cross-lingual clusters in-
clude a lot of word alignment errors. In order to
address this problem, we filter the clusters by only
keeping those predicates including the original
predicate forms in ACE training data or Eng-
lish/Chinese Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue
and Palmer, 2009).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996601">
4.2 Acquisition from Cross-lingual IE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996083">
Based on the intuition that Machine Translation
(MT) may translate a Chinese trigger word into
different English words in different contexts, we
employ the second approach using cross-lingual IE
techniques (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007) on TDT5
Chinese corpus to generate more clusters. We ap-
ply the following two cross-lingual IE pipelines:
Chinese IE_MT: Apply Chinese IE on the Chinese
texts to get a set of Chinese triggers ch-trigger-set1,
and then use word alignments to translate (project)
ch-trigger-set1 into a set of English triggers en-
trigger-set1;
MT_English IE: Translate Chinese texts into Eng-
lish, and then apply English IE on the translated
texts to get a set of English triggers en-trigger-set2.
For any Chinese trigger ch-trigger in ch-trigger-
set1, if its corresponding translation en-trigger in
en-trigger-set1 is the same as that in en-trigger-
set2, then we add en-trigger into the cluster an-
chored by ch-trigger.
We apply the English and Chinese IE systems
as described in (Grishman et al., 2005; Chen and Ji,
2009). Both cross-lingual IE pipelines need ma-
chine translation to translate Chinese documents
(for English IE) or project the extraction results
from Chinese IE into English. We use the RWTH
Aachen Chinese-to-English statistical phrase-based
machine translation system (Zens and Ney, 2004)
for these purposes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997895">
4.3 Derived Cross-lingual Predicate Clusters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986166666667">
Applying the above two approaches we obtained
438 English predicate clusters and 543 Chinese
predicate clusters.
For example, for a trigger “9(injure)”, we can
get the following two predicate clusters with their
frequency in the parallel corpora:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988336142857143">
94 (injured:99 injuries:96 injury:76
wounded:38 wounding:28 injuring:14 wounds:7
killed:4 died:2 mutilated:1 casualties:1 chop:1 kill-
ing:1 shot:1}.
injured 4 (199:1624 59:102 9:99 09:29 9
-V:23 0:12 �79:10 40:6 9x:•3 RT:-2 *Z-1
T:•1 R9:1 IWA:1 &amp;/0.•1 -M•1 00.1 go.-1 }
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825111111111">
We can see that the predicates in the same clus-
ter are not restrictedly synonyms, but they were
generated as alternative translations for the same
word and therefore represent similar meanings.
More importantly, these triggers vary from very
common ones such as ‘injured’ to rare words such
as ‘mutilate’. This indicates how these clusters can
aid extracting low-confidence events: when decid-
ing whether a word ‘mutilate’ indicates a “Life-

Injure” event in a certain context, we can replace it
with other predicates in the same cluster and may
provide us more reliable overall evidence.
Figure 2 presents the distribution of clusters
which include more than one predicate.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998699">
Figure 2. Cluster Size Distribution
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866166666667">
We can see that most clusters include 2-9 predi-
cates in both English and Chinese. However on
average English clusters include more predicates.
In addition, there are many more singletons in
Chinese (232) than in English (101). This indicates
that Chinese event triggers are more ambiguous.

5 Motivation of Using Cross-lingual Clus-
ters for Event Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807666666667">
After extracting cross-lingual predicate clusters,
we can combine the evidence from all the predi-
cates in each cluster to adjust the probabilities of
event labeling. In the following we present some
examples in both languages to demonstrate this
motivation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97759">
5.1 Improve Rare Trigger Labeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999226857142857">
Due to the limited training data, many trigger
words only appear a few times as a particular type
of event. This data sparse problem directly leads to
the low recall of trigger labeling. But exploiting
the evidence from other predicates in the same
cluster may boost the confidence score of the can-
didate event. We present two examples as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.450124">
(1) English Example 1
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998443">
For example, “blown up” doesn’t appear in the
training data as a “Conflict-Attack” event, and so it
cannot be identified in the following test sentence.
However, if we replace it with other predicates in
the same cluster, the system can easily identify
‘Conflict-Attack’ events in the new sentences with
high confidence values:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.963598588235294">
(a) Test Sentence:

dence=0:

ing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969081">
Chinese predicate clusters anchored by English
words can also provide external evidence for event
identification. For example, the trigger word “§0
(release/parole)” appears rarely in the Chinese
training data but in most cases it can be replaced
by a more frequent trigger “0!C(release)” to rep-
resent the same meaning. Therefore by combining
the evidence from “0&amp;” we can enhance the con-
fidence value of identifying “R0” as a “Justice-
Release_Parole” event. For example,

On the other hand, some common words are highly
ambiguous in particular contexts. But the other
less-ambiguous predicates in the clusters can help
classify event types more accurately.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.487681">

<bodyText confidence="0.997982666666667">
For example, in the following sentence the “Per-

“step” doesn’t indicate any ACE events in the
training data. However, after replacing “step” with
other prediates such as “quit”, the system can iden-
tify the event more easily:

Some single-character Chinese predicates can rep-
resent many different event types in different con-
texts. For example, the word “打” appears in 27
different predicate clusters, representing the mean-
ing of hit/call/strike/form/take/draw etc. Therefore
we can take use of other less ambiguous predicates
in these clusters to adjust the likelihood of event
classification.
For example, in the following test sentence, the
word “打” indicates two different event types. If
we replace these words with other predicates, we
can classify them into different event types more
accurately based on the evidence from replaced
predicates and contexts.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977615384615">
We design a framework of inductive learning to
incorporate the derived predicate clusters. The
general idea of inductive learning is to analyze in-
formation from all kinds of specific examples until
we can draw a conclusion. Since the main goal of
our approach is to improve the recall of event ex-
traction, we shall focus on those events generated
by the baseline tagger with low confidence. For
those events we automatically generate back-
ground documents using the predicate clusters (de-
tails in section 6.1) and then conduct global
inference between each test document and its
background documents (section 6.2).

For each background document BD, we apply the

inference techniques as described in (Ji and
Grishman, 2008) to improve trigger and argument
labeling performance by favoring interpretation
consistency across the test events and background
events.
This approach is based on the premise that many
events will be reported multiple times from differ-
ent sources in different forms. This naturally oc-
curs in the test document and the background
document because they include triggers from the
same predicate cluster.
By aggregating events across each pair of test
document TD and background document BD, we
conduct the following statistical global inference:

We can see that the best performance on the de-
velopment set can be obtained by selecting thresh-
old 0.6, achieving 9.4% better recall with a little
loss in precision (0.26%) compared to the baseline
(with threshold=0) . Then we apply this threshold
value directly for blind test. This optimizing pro-
cedure is repeated for Chinese as well.

Table 2 shows the overall Precision (P), Recall (R)
and F-Measure (F) scores for the blind test set.
For both English and Chinese, the inductive
learning approach using cross-lingual predicate
clusters provided significant improvement over the
baseline event extraction system (about 4% abso-
lute improvement on trigger labeling and 2%-2.3%
on argument labeling). The most significant gain
was provided for the recall of trigger labeling –
5.9% absolute improvement for English and 5.4%
absolute improvement for Chinese.
Surprisingly this approach didn’t cause any loss
in precision. In fact small gains were obtained on
precision for both languages. This indicates that
cross-lingual predicate clusters are effective at ad-
justing the confidence values so that the events
were not over-generated. The refined event trigger
labeling also directly yields better performance in
argument labeling.
We conducted the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs
Signed-Ranks Test on a document basis. The re-
sults show that for both languages the improve-
ment using cross-lingual predicate clusters is
significant at a 99.7% confidence level for trigger
labeling and a 96.4% confidence level for argu-
ment labeling.

For comparison we attempted a self-training ap-

set back as additional training data and re-train the
event tagger. This produced 1.7% worse F-measure
score for the English development set. It further

proves that using the test set itself is not enough,
we need to explore new predicates to serve as
background evidence.
In addition we also applied a bootstrapping ap-
proach using relevant unlabeled data and obtained
limited improvement – about 1.6% F-measure gain
for English. As Ji and Grishman (2006) pointed out,
both self-training and bootstrapping methods re-
quire good data selection scheme. But not for any
test set we can easily find relevant unlabeled data.
Therefore the approach presented in this paper is
less expensive – we can automatically generate
background data while introducing new evidence.
An alternative way of incorporating the cross-
lingual predicate clusters would follow (Miller et
al., 2004), namely encoding the cluster member-
ship as an additional feature in the supervised-
learning procedure of the baseline event tagger.
However in the situation where we cannot directly
change the algorithms of the baseline system, our
approach of inductive learning is more flexible.

Our approach of extracting predicate clusters is
related to some prior work on paraphrase or word
cluster discovery, either from mono-lingual paral-
lel corpora (e.g. Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin
and Pantel, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Pang et al.,
2003) or cross-lingual parallel corpora (e.g. Ban-
nard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch,
2008). Shinyama and Sekine (2003) presented an
approach of extracting paraphrases using names,
dates and numbers as anchors. Hasegawa et al.
(2004) described a paraphrase discovery approach
based on clustering concurrent name pairs.
Several recent studies have stressed the benefits
of using paraphrases or word clusters to improve
IE components. For example, (Miller et al., 2004)
proved that word clusters can significantly improve
English name tagging. The idea of using predicates
in the same cluster for candidate trigger replace-
ment is similar to Ge et al.(1998) who used local
context replacement for pronoun resolution. To the
best of our knowledge, our work presented the first
experiment of using cross-lingual predicate para-
phrases for the ACE event extraction task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999732227272727">
In this paper we described two approaches to ex-
tract cross-lingual predicate clusters, and designed
a new inductive learning framework to effectively
incorporate these clusters for event extraction.
Without using any additional data or changing the
baseline algorithms, we demonstrated that this
method can significantly enhance the performance
of a state-of-the-art bilingual event tagger.
We have noticed that the current filtering
scheme based on Propbank may be too restricted to
keep enough informative predicates. In the future
we will attempt incorporating POS tagging results
and frequency information.
In addition we will extend this framework to ex-
tract cross-lingual relation and name clusters to
improve other IE tasks such as name tagging, rela-
tion extraction, event coreference and event trans-
lation. We are also interested in automatically
discovering new event types (non-ACE event types)
or more fine-grained subtypes/attributes for exist-
ing ACE event types from the derived predicate
clusters.

As for a separate research theme, extensive techniques have been used to produce word clusters or paraphrases from large unlabeled corpora (Brown et al., 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Lee and Pereira, 1999, Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Pang et al., 2003).

It further 33 proves that using the test set itself is not enough, we need to explore new predicates to serve as background evidence. In addition we also applied a bootstrapping approach using relevant unlabeled data and obtained limited improvement – about 1.6% F-measure gain for English. As Ji and Grishman (2006) pointed out, both self-training and bootstrapping methods require good data selection scheme. But not for any test set we can easily find relevant unlabeled data. Therefore the approach presented in this paper is less expensive – we can automatically generate background data while introducing new evidence.

For each Chinese trigger, we search its automatically aligned English words from a Chinese-English parallel corpus including 50,000 sentence pairs (part of Global Autonomous Language Exploitation Y3 Machine Translation training corpora) to construct an English predicate cluster. The word alignment was obtained by running Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003). In each cluster we record the frequency of each unique English word. Then we conduct the same procedure in the other direction to construct Chinese predicate clusters anchored by English triggers. State-of-the-art Chinese-English word alignment error rate is about 40% (Deng and Byrne, 2005). Therefore the resulting cross-lingual clusters include a lot of word alignment errors.

In each cluster we record the frequency of each unique English word. Then we conduct the same procedure in the other direction to construct Chinese predicate clusters anchored by English triggers. State-of-the-art Chinese-English word alignment error rate is about 40% (Deng and Byrne, 2005). Therefore the resulting cross-lingual clusters include a lot of word alignment errors. In order to address this problem, we filter the clusters by only keeping those predicates including the original predicate forms in ACE training data or English/Chinese Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2009). 4.2 Acquisition from Cross-lingual IE Based on the intuition that Machine Translation (MT) may translate a Chinese trigger word into different English words in different contexts, we employ the second approach using cross-lingual IE techniques (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007) on TDT5 Chinese corpus to generate more clusters. We apply the following two cross-lingual IE pipelines: Chinese IE_MT: Apply Chinese IE on the Chinese texts to get a set of Chinese triggers ch-trigger-set1, and then use word alignments to translate (project) ch-trigger-set1 into a set of English trigge</context>

This extension has made event extraction more widely applicable in many NLP tasks including crosslingual document retrieval (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2007) and question answering (Schiffman et al., 2007). Various supervised learning approaches 1 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ 27 have been explored for ACE multi-lingual event extraction (e.g. Grishman et al., 2005; Ahn, 2006; Hardy et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2008; Chen and Ji, 2009).

For any Chinese trigger ch-trigger in ch-triggerset1, if its corresponding translation en-trigger in en-trigger-set1 is the same as that in en-triggerset2, then we add en-trigger into the cluster anchored by ch-trigger. We apply the English and Chinese IE systems as described in (Grishman et al., 2005; Chen and Ji, 2009). Both cross-lingual IE pipelines need machine translation to translate Chinese documents (for English IE) or project the extraction results from Chinese IE into English. We use the RWTH Aachen Chinese-to-English statistical phrase-based machine translation system (Zens and Ney, 2004) for these purposes. 4.3 Derived Cross-lingual Predicate Clusters Applying the above two approaches we obtained 438 English predicate clusters and 543 Chinese predicate clusters. For example, for a trigger “9(injure)”, we can get the following two predicate clusters with their frequency in the parallel corpora: 94 (injured:99 injuries:96 injury:76 wounded:38 wounding:28 injuring:14 wounds:7 killed:4 died:2 mutilated:1 casualties:1 chop:1 killing:1 shot:1}. injured 4 (199:1624 59:102 9:99 09:29 9 -V:23 0:12 �79:10 40:6 9x:•3 RT:-2 *Z-1 T:•1 R9:1 IWA:1 &amp;/0.•1 -M•1 00.1 go.-1 } We can see that th</context>
