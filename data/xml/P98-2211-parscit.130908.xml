Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999922142857143">
This paper explores the possibilities and limits of a
discourse grammar applied to spontaneous speech.
Most discourse grammars (e.g. SDRT, Asher, 1993;
RST, Mann &amp; Thompson, 1988) tend to be descrip-
tive theories of written discourse which presuppose
a coherent structure. This structure is the outcome
of a goal directed planning process on the part of
the producer. In order to obtain a better understand-
ing of the planning process we analyse spoken dis-
course elicited in an experimental setting. Subjects
describe the pixel-per-pixel development of sketch-
maps on a computer screen. This forces the speak-
ers to conceptualise the perceived state of affairs,
plan their discourse, and produce a description of
the drawing at the same time. Thus we find evi-
dence for the planning process in the recorded data
and can show that the discourse structures are less
globally coherent than those underlying written text.
In our paper we discuss to what extent a flexible dis-
course grammar based on a Tree Description Gram-
mar (TDG) (Schilder, 1997) can handle such data.

We investigate in this paper to what extent a dis-
course grammar is capable of analysing sponta-
neous speech that is obviously not as well structured
as written text. The example text discussed contains
questions and remarks which do not seem to be part
of the discourse. Nevertheless, we believe that the
entire spoken discourse is to be represented by one
discourse structure. Evidence for this assumption
comes from the observation that anaphoric refer-
ences are made between questions which apparently

comment on the planning process and the actual de-
scription of the sketch-map.
Following Schilder (1997) a discourse gram-
mar based on a Tree Description Grammar (TDG)
(Kallmeyer, 1996) is used for the analysis of an ex-
ample text. TDG is employed to encode the dy-
namics of the discourse structure. Other discourse
theories like Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory (SDRT) (Asher, 1993) or Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST) (Mann &amp; Thompson, 1988) offer
only a descriptive explanation.
The remaining part of the paper is organised as
follows. Section 2 contains a description of the ex-
perimental setting in which the example discourse
was obtained (Habel and Tappe, forthcoming). Sec-
tion 3 provides an outline of the example before a
short introduction to the discourse grammar is given
in section 4. Section 5 offers the formalisation of
the example discourse and section 6 concludes and
describes areas for ongoing research.

<bodyText confidence="0.999698764705882">
Subjects were presented with sketch-maps. These
were previously drawn by students who had been
asked to sketch the route between the Computer Sci-
ence Department and the main campus of their uni-
versity. Since the two landmarks are approximately
6 km apart, all of the sketch-maps included some
means of transport. The drawings were made on a
drawing tablet and subsequently stored on a com-
puter hard-disc. In the verbalisation-phase replays
of the drawings were used as stimulus material. A
new group of subjects was presented with one of the
drawings. They had to carefully watch what hap-
pened and simultaneously describe what they were
seeing, while the graphical objects became visible
on the previously empty screen in the same chrono-
logical order they were produced. The verbalisers
were familiar with the route between the two Uni-

For the present analysis we chose a fragment of one
of the online-verbalisations, consisting of the first
seven utterances describing the sketch-map segment
that is illustrated in figure 1.

3 Analysis of the text fragment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965284985915493">
The text fragment contains a variety of features that
are characteristic of spoken rather than of written
discourse. In this section we will look at each of the
utterances in greater detail and show how the dis-
course coherence is maintained by the speaker. He
starts talking as soon as he sees the rectangle being
drawn on the screen. The first utterance (U1) can
be characterised as a statement about the speaker&apos;s
current mental state:
UI: Ja, ich weiB ja schon worum es geht, (Yes, I already
know what this is all about,)
The speaker hereby expresses a self-belief the con-
tent of which can be circumscribed as follows: I (the
speaker) know which states-of-affairs I am about to
see on the computer screen. This utterance serves
as a kind of background for what follows. With
his statement, the speaker commits himself to prove
that he really knows what is going on. With the sub-
sequent utterance (U2) he demonstrates that he has
at least some intuition about the stimulus material:
He assigns the rectangle the name of the depicted
real world object.
U2: also das wird das Informatikgebaude ... mit der Be-
schreibung daneben. (well, this is going to be the build-
ing of the Computer Science department... with the an-
notation next to it)
Accordingly, he fulfills part of the felicity condi-
tions that accompany assertions about the posses-
sion of knowledge, i.e. he elaborates on the con-
tent of his belief-state. The elaboration-relation
between (U1) and (U2) is triggered by the dis-
course marker also. With the next utterance the
speaker adds further information to his states-of-
affairs-description.
U3: und die StraBen die jetzt angefangen werden zu
malen... (and the streets that are now started to be
drawn...)
Therefore, we can categorise the relation between
(U2) and (U3) as a narration-relation. This relation
does not add a new perspective or a new theme to the
ongoing discourse, but rather supports its continua-
tion. On contrast, (U4) establishes a break in the
ongoing discourse. The discourse marker eigentlich
signals that the speakers has build up an expectation
about the continuation of the drawing event on the
basis of his belief state.
U4: Eigentlich wiirde ich erwarten,(Actually I would ex-
pect)
The content of the belief state is — as mentioned
before — that the speaker believes to know what
will be drawn. Yet, this belief state ends here, be-
cause even though the speaker rightly interprets the
developing double lines to represent streets (cf. U3
above) his further expectation is not met. The con-
tent of this expectation is expressed in (U5):
U5: dal3 irgendwo die Bushaltestelle noch eingezeichnet
wird, da im... (that the bus stop was drawn into it some-
where, there in the...)
Obviously the speaker expects that the drawing will
contain a symbol representing a bus-stop near to the
building. This is not the case. Therefore the rhetor-
ical relation between (U4) and (U1) is that of a ter-
mination. We see that rhetorical relations do not
necessarily hold between adjacent utterances only,
but that an utterance may open a subtree that can be
closed off by an utterance that is verbalised a couple
of utterances later. (US) breaks off with a preposi-
tional phrase that lacks the location argument (...da
im...). The speaker is quite obviously insecure about
the name of the street that contains the bus-stop.
(U6) reveals his insecurity.

course. It is not in a strict sense part of the ongoing
discourse, but the verbalisation of vocabulary search
and planning processes. We hold that the interrog-
ative intonation functions as a signal, allowing the
integration of a substructure that is not connected
to the previous discourse via a prototypical rhetor-
ical relation. The substructure itself can be inter-
preted as a meta-comment about the ongoing men-
tal processes. This substructure is closed off by (U7)
which begins with aber (&apos;but&apos;).
U7:Aber ...keine Bushaltestelle (But ... no bus stop)
This discourse marker allows the speaker to return
to the branching node of the discourse structure
where the digression was introduced.

4.1 Tree descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844307692308">
A definition of TDG is given by Kallmeyer (1996)
who introduces tree descriptions consisting of con-
straints for finite labelled trees. A dominance rela-
tion (&lt;1*) between node labels indicates that these
two labels can be equated or have a path of arbitrary
length inserted between them. The second relation
between nodes is the parent relation (1) which is
irreflexive, asymmetric and intransitive.
The tree&apos;s root node D labelled k1 in figure 2,
for example, dominates another node labelled k2.
According to the definition of &lt;1* these two nodes
may be equal or an arbitrary number of other nodes
may be in between them. An adjoining operation

is easily defined because of this property. Fur-
ther tree descriptions can be inserted between such
nodes. The descriptions which are, formally speak-
ing, negation-free formulae of constraints on the
nodes, are conjoined. The nodes where the adjunc-
tion takes place are set to equal.&apos;

4.2 A flexible discourse grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999735233333333">
According to Schilder (1997), feature value struc-
tures are added to the tree logic in order to enrich
it with rhetorical relations and further discourse in-
formation. One non-terminal symbol is used for the
D(iscourse) segments, whereas the terminals are the
S(entences).
Two features are added to the tree description to
encode the semantic content of the sentence and the
&apos;topic&apos; information expressed in a discourse. Firstly,
S gets associated with the meaning of a sentence
via a feature CONT(ENT) containing all discourse
referents and the conditions imposed on them.2
Secondly, a feature PROM I( NENT) is added that is
used to define the notion of openness within a dis-
course. This feature reflects the fact that one situa-
tion described by an utterance (e.g. situation el de-
scribed by U1) is subordinated by another one when
combined via a rhetorical relation. It furthermore
exhibits the restriction of the further utterances to
the right frontier of the discourse tree (cf. (Webber,
1991)).
For the discourse structure two types of tree de-
scriptions have to be distinguished. One tree struc-
ture allows attachment on two levels of the right
frontier of the tree. This tree is called subordinated
tree and the structure is schematically indicated in
figure 2. The other one is a subordinating structure
that is triggered by discourse relations such as nar-
ration or result. Further attachment is only possible
at the last uttered sentence.3

The discourse structure obtained for the first three
sentences of the example text is reflected in figure
3. At first an elaboration relation is established be-
tween (U1) and (U2). The imposed discourse struc-
ture (i.e. a subordinated tree as in figure 2) allows
attachment at two levels. Note furthermore that the
elaboration relation holds between the mental state
of the producer (i.e. I already know what this is all
about) and the description of what is happening on
the screen.4
(U3) is connected with (U2) via narration. The
adjunction operation in figure 3 shows how the

newly generated sentence is incorporated in the cur-
rent discourse structure.
Although the production took place under a cer-
tain amount of pressure, the right frontier principle
was never violated. The speaker never went back
or made anaphoric references to discourse referents
being behind this frontier.
Having demonstrated how the production of the
discourse structure can be formally described for the
first three utterances, we now want to focus on a
particularly interesting problem exhibited by the se-
quence (U4) to (U6). This sequence contains rhetor-
ical questions, which describe the ongoing planning
process of the speaker.5
The sequence starts with an expectation
(i.e. (U4)) the subject utters. Again the proposition
expressed is related to the mental state of the
speaker. Interestingly enough, he has to return to
the top level of the discourse tree and continue
from there. Consequently, the discourse segment
containing (U2) and (U3) is &apos;cut off&apos; and not
available for further attachment.
Embedded within the expectation is an utterance
describing the ongoing planning and searching pro-
cess. The verbalised questions reflect the request to
the mental lexicon and the mental map the subject
has got of this area.
The discourse grammar consequently has to be

ten text.
extended in order to maintain a coherent discourse
structure for the modelling of the producer. Thus
rhetorical relations describing planning processes
are introduced. With these, the discourse gram-
mar becomes capable of representing a coherent dis-
course structure for the spoken language despite the
fact that the entire discourse segment does not seem
as coherent as written text.
Figure 4 contains the discourse structure after the
search for the street name has come to an end. One
rhetorical relation introduced is p(lan)_comment
which describes the ongoing planning process. It
also involves a search for the correct word in the
lexicon. The rhetorical quest(ion) is asked whether
the correct word has been chosen and this question
answered by the subject. The summarising yes, isn&apos;t
it (i.e. (U6b)) ends the search process and closes the
discourse structure at the right frontier.
Interestingly enough, the clue given by the dis-
course marker but uttered in (U7) is absolutely es-
sential. The speaker indicates with this marker that
he wants to return to the top level of the discourse
tree and to add a contrast relation to the expectation.
The construction of the discourse structure contin-
ues therefore at the top level of the tree in figure 4.

Following Schilder (1997) a discourse grammar based on a Tree Description Grammar (TDG) (Kallmeyer, 1996) is used for the analysis of an example text. TDG is employed to encode the dynamics of the discourse structure. Other discourse theories like Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher, 1993) or Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann &amp; Thompson, 1988) offer only a descriptive explanation. The remaining part of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains a description of the experimental setting in which the example discourse was obtained (Habel and Tappe, forthcoming). Section 3 provides an outline of the example before a short introduction to the discourse grammar is given in section 4. Section 5 offers the formalisation of the example discourse and section 6 concludes and describes areas for ongoing research. 2 Method and material 2.1 Method Subjects were presented with sketch-maps.

Subjects describe the pixel-per-pixel development of sketchmaps on a computer screen. This forces the speakers to conceptualise the perceived state of affairs, plan their discourse, and produce a description of the drawing at the same time. Thus we find evidence for the planning process in the recorded data and can show that the discourse structures are less globally coherent than those underlying written text. In our paper we discuss to what extent a flexible discourse grammar based on a Tree Description Grammar (TDG) (Schilder, 1997) can handle such data. 1 Introduction We investigate in this paper to what extent a discourse grammar is capable of analysing spontaneous speech that is obviously not as well structured as written text. The example text discussed contains questions and remarks which do not seem to be part of the discourse. Nevertheless, we believe that the entire spoken discourse is to be represented by one discourse structure. Evidence for this assumption comes from the observation that anaphoric references are made between questions which apparently * This work is partly funded by the German Science Foundati</context>

An adjoining operation ki:D k2:D k3:D k4:D k5:D k6 :S Figure 2: A labelled tree description is easily defined because of this property. Further tree descriptions can be inserted between such nodes. The descriptions which are, formally speaking, negation-free formulae of constraints on the nodes, are conjoined. The nodes where the adjunction takes place are set to equal.&apos; &apos;Figure 3 shows an example. 4.2 A flexible discourse grammar According to Schilder (1997), feature value structures are added to the tree logic in order to enrich it with rhetorical relations and further discourse information. One non-terminal symbol is used for the D(iscourse) segments, whereas the terminals are the S(entences). Two features are added to the tree description to encode the semantic content of the sentence and the &apos;topic&apos; information expressed in a discourse. Firstly, S gets associated with the meaning of a sentence via a feature CONT(ENT) containing all discourse referents and the conditions imposed on them.2 Secondly, a feature PROM I( NENT) is added that is used</context>

Firstly, S gets associated with the meaning of a sentence via a feature CONT(ENT) containing all discourse referents and the conditions imposed on them.2 Secondly, a feature PROM I( NENT) is added that is used to define the notion of openness within a discourse. This feature reflects the fact that one situation described by an utterance (e.g. situation el described by U1) is subordinated by another one when combined via a rhetorical relation. It furthermore exhibits the restriction of the further utterances to the right frontier of the discourse tree (cf. (Webber, 1991)). For the discourse structure two types of tree descriptions have to be distinguished. One tree structure allows attachment on two levels of the right frontier of the tree. This tree is called subordinated tree and the structure is schematically indicated in figure 2. The other one is a subordinating structure that is triggered by discourse relations such as narration or result. Further attachment is only possible at the last uttered sentence.3 5 Formalisation The discourse structure obtained for the first three sentences of the example text is reflected in figure 3.
