<bodyText confidence="0.999542666666667">
In June of 1952, ten years before the founding
of the Association, the first meeting ever held on
computational linguistics took place. This meet-
ing, the succeeding ten years, and the first year
of the Association are discussed. Some thoughts
are offered as to what the future may bring.

I THE EARLY YEARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827651685393">
When the suggestion came from Don Walker to
celebrate our twentieth anniversary by a panel
discussion I responded with enthusiasm at the op-
portunity for us all to reminisce. Much has hap-
pened in those twenty years to look back on, and
there have been many changes: Not many here will
remember that founding meeting. As our thoughts go
back to the beginnings it must also be with a note
of sadness, for some of our most illustrious early
members can no longer be counted among the living.
Not many of you will remember either that our
meeting here today marks another anniversary of
signal importance for this Association. Thirty
years ago the first organized conference ever to be
held in the field of computational linguistics took
place. The coincidence of the dates is remarkable.
This conference is on June 16-18, 1982, that one
was on June 17-20, 1952, overlapping two of our
three dates. That meeting was the M.I.T. Confer-
ence on Mechanical Translation. It was an inter-
national meeting organized by Y. Bar-Hillel and
held at the faculty club. If our association
was born twenty years ago, this was the moment of
its conception, exactly thirty years ago. I will
try to recall that meeting for you, as best I can,
for I propose that we celebrate that anniversary as
well.
For that very first meeting Bar-Hillel had
brought together eighteen interested people from
both coasts and from En6lepd. The first session
was an evening session open to the public. It
consisted of five short semi-popular talks. The
real business of the meeting took place the next
three days in closed sessions in a pleasant room
overlooking the Charles River. We sat around a
kind of rectangular round-table, listened to fif-
teen prepared papers or presentations, and discus-
sed them with a no-holds-barred give-and-take cata-
lyzed by the intense, open, and candidly outspoken
personality of Bar-Hillel. He was the only person
I ever knew who could argue with you, shouting
excitedly at the top of his lungs until your back
was literally against the wall, and always with
that angelic smile on his face and you couldn&apos;t
help liking him through it all. The stenotype
transcript of the discussion at that first meeting
makes interesting reading even today. The partici-
pants grappled in a preliminary but often insight-
ful way with difficult issues many of which are
still with us.
As for the papers at the conference, three
were given by Erwin Reifler of the Far Eastern and
Russian Institute, the University of Washington;
two by Victor Oswald of the Department of Germanic
Languages, UCLA; two by William Bull of the Depart-
ment of Spanish, UCLA; one each by Stuart Dodd of
the University of Washington, William Locke of the
Department of Modern Languages, M.I.T., James Perry
of the Center for International Studies, M.I.T.,
Harry Huskey of the National Bureau of Standards
computer lab at UCLA, and Jay Forrester of the
Digital Computer Laboratory, M.I.T. Two were by
Bar-Hillel himself, from M.I.T.; and one was by A.
D. Booth of the Electronic Computer Section, Birk-
beck college, London. Most of the substantial
papers were later revised for publication as some
of the fourteen articles in the volume Machine
Translation ar languactes edited by Locke and Booth,
or in the pages of the journal pechanical Transla-
tion, which was started in March of 1954. Two
reports of the conference were subsequently pub-
lished in the journal, one by Erwin Reifler and one
by Craig Reynolds, Jr. of IBM.
The ten years between the first conference and
the founding of the Association were marked by many
newsworthy events and considerable technical prog-
ress. A number of individuals and groups entered
the field, both here and abroad, and an adequate
level of support materialized, mostly from govern-
ment agencies. This important contribution to
progress in our field should be a matter of pride
to the agencies involved. It was an essential
ingredient in the mix of efforts that have put us
where we are today. Progress in that first ten
years can be estimated by considering that up to
the time of the founding of the Association the
journal yeahanieal Translatimpublished 52 arti-
cles, 187 abstracts of the literature, and ran to
532 pages.

To review all of that research adequately
would be a large task, and one that I will not
undertake here. But I should like to say that it
includes a number of cases where computer tech-
niques have played an essential role in linguistic
research. Just one example is the work on the
depth hypothesis during the summer of 1959, which
owes everything to the heuristic advantages of
computer modeling in linguistics. Those linguists
who still scorn or ignore computational linguistics
should consider carefully those many examples of
the efficacy of computer methods in their disci-
pline.

II FOUNDING THE SOCIETY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917219047619">
Toward the end of those ten years the need for
a professional society became clear. We did keep
in touch by phone and letter, and ad hoc committees
had been formed for various purposes. But most of
all we needed a formal organization to bring a
degree of order into the process of planning meet-
ings. We could make plans through our informal
contacts, but there was always the problem that new
groups or existing organizations would go ahead
with plans of their own for meetings too soon
before or after our own. There were also requests
from sponsoring agencies for symposia reviewing
progress and encouraging cooperation between the
growing number of federally supported projects. We
wanted regular meetings but we resisted the idea of
having too many.
As an example of the situation we faced, I
received a letter early in 1959 from the Associa-
tion for Computing Machinery, who were planning a
National Conference to be held at M.I.T. September
1-3, 1959. They asked me if I thought that people
connected with mechanical translation would like to
have a session at the meeting or meet concurrently.
I said I didn&apos;t know, but agreed to write to some
people in the field about it. I did write, offer-
ing to set up a session or a separate meeting if
others wanted me to do it, but expressing the
thought that there were very few of us doing re-
search in the field and that there now were a
number of organizations that would like to include
mechanical translation papers in their programs to
build interest and attendance. It was a hot topic
at the time.
We did not take up the ACM in their kind
offer. Had we done so, we might today be a Special
Interest Group of the ACM, and that would have
hindered our close ties to linguistics.
In any event, the people at UCLA organized a
National Symposium on Machine Translation, which
took place on February 2-5, 1960, just five months
after the date of the ACM meeting, and five months
after that, on July 18-22, 1960, a meeting of
federally sponsored machine translation workers,
organized by Harry Josselson and supported by NSF
and ONR was held at the Princeton Inn, Princeton,
New Jersey. The next year, on April 4-7, 1961, a
similar conference was held at Georgetown Univer-
sity, and just five months after that, on September
5-8, 1961, the National Physical Laboratory in
Teddington, England hosted an International Confer-
ence on Machine Translation of Languages and Ap-
plied Language Analysis. Something clearly had to
be done. So the stage had been set, and nine
months later, on June 13, 1962, at another confer-
ence organized by the irrepressible Harry Josselson
at the Princeton Inn, we finally founded a profes-
sional society: The Association for Machine Trans-
lation and Computational Linguistics, renamed six
years later the Association for Computational Lin-
guistics.
I have not been able to locate a list of our
charter members. I am sure one exists. The offi-
cers for the first year were Victor H. Yngve,
President; David G. Hays, Vice-President; and Harry
H. Josselson, Secretary-Treasurer. Mrs. Ida Rhodes,
Paul Garvin, and Winfred P. Lehmann were members of
the Executive Council. Richard See, Anthony G.
Oettinger, and Sydney H. Lamb were members of the
Nominating Committee. Our announced purpose was to
encourage high professional standards by sponsoring
meetings, publication, and other exchange of infor-
mation. It was to provide a means of doing to-
gether&apos;what individuals cannot do alone.
Many of us had hoped for a truly international
association. We felt this would be particularly
appropriate for an organization involved in trying
to improve the means for international communica-
tion through mechanical translation. But the cost
of travel, travel restrictions from some countries,
and various other practical problems stood in the
way. We became an international but predominantly
American association. We decided from the begin-
ning to meet in alternate years in conjunction with
a major computer conference and a major linguistics
conference.
My year of tenure as President was uneventful,
or so it seems. It is difficult to extract one
year of memories twenty years ago. I do remember a
trip to Denver to see about arrangements for our
first annual meeting at the Denver Hilton, to take
place August 25 and 26, 1963, the two days immedi-
ately preceding the ACM National Conference. The
local arrangements people for that meeting were
most helpful. The program was put together by
Harry Josselson. There were thirty-four papers
covering a wide variety of topics including syntac-
tic analysis, semantics, particulars of languages,
theoretical linguistics, research procedures, and
research techniques. Abstracts for the thirty four
papers were published in jlechanical Translation,
Vol. 7, No. 2, and a group photograph of some of
the delegates attending appeared in Vol. 8, No. 1.
Looking at this photograph and those taken at
earlier conferences and published in earlier issues
invokes considerable nostalgia for those days.

larly important for the future. These thoughts
were also embodied in a longer paper read to the
American Philosophical Society three months later,
in November 1963, and published the next year by
that organization. I should like to quote a few
sentences for they are particularly appropriate at
this point:
&amp;quot;A new field of research has grown up which
revolves about languages, computers, and symbolic
processes. This sometimes is called computational
linguistics, mechanical linguistics, information
processing, symbol manipulation, and soon. None
of the names are really adequate. The implications
of this research for the future are far-reaching.
Imagine what it would mean if we had computer
programs that could actually understand English.
Besides the obvious practical implications, the
implications for our understanding of language are
most exciting. This research promises to give us
new insights into the way in which languages convey
information, the way in which people understand
English, the nature of thought processes, the na-
ture of our theories, ideas, and prejudices, and
eventually a deeper understanding of ourselves.
Perhaps one of the last frontiers of man&apos;s under-
standing of his environment is his understanding of
man and his mental processes.
&amp;quot;This new field touches, with various degrees
of overlap and interaction, the already well-estab-
lished diverse fields of linguistics, psychology,
logic, philosophy, information theory, circuit
theory, and computer design. The interaction with
linguistics has already produced several small
revolutions in methodology, point of view, insight
into language, and standards of rigor and exact-
ness. It appears that before we are done, linguis-
tics will be completely revolutionized.&amp;quot;
This quotation is particularly apt because I
still believe that before we are done linguistics
will be completely revolutionized. Let we explain.
First, the difficulties in mechanizing translation
had already at that early date called attention to
fundamental inadequacies in linguistic theory,
traditional or transformational, it makes no dif-
ference. Second, the depth hypothesis and the
problems raised in trying to square it with current
linguistic theory threw further doubt on the scien-
tific integrity of linguistics. And third, the
depth hypothesis also provided an important clue as
to how the inadequacies in linguistic theory might
eventually be overcome. I have spent the last two
decades or so following this lead and trying to
find a more satisfactory foundation for linguis-
tics. The following is a brief progress report to
the parent body, as it were. A recent written
report may be found in the Alanua LineuaruaLeries
Maior volume 97, edited by Florian Coulmas.
Modern scientific linguistics, since its be-
ginning a century and a half ago, has been charac-
terized by three central goals (1) that it study
language, (2) that it be scientific, and (3) that
it seek explanations in terms of people. It turns
out that these goals are contradictory and mutually
incompatible, and this is the underlying reason for
the most serious inadequacies in linguistic theory.
Linguistics, and that includes computational
linguistics, is faced with two mutually exclusive
alternatives. We can either accept the first goal
and study language by the methods of grammar, or we
can accept the second and third goals and seek
explanations of communicative phenomena in terms of
people by the methods of. science.
We cannot continue with business a usual and
try to have it both ways. Basically this is be-
cause science studies real objects given in advance
whereas grammar studies objects that are only
created by a point of view, as Saussure realized.
Their study rests on a special assumption that
places grammar outside of science. To try to have
it both ways also leads to the fallacies of the
psychological and social reality of grammar.
The full implications of this fork in the road
that linguistics faces is just now sinking in.
Only the second alternative is viable, science
rather than grammar. This means we will have to
give up the two thousand year grammatical tradition
at the core of linguistic thought and reconstruct
the discipline on well-known scientific principles
instead. This will open up vast opportunities for
research to uncover that essential and unique part
of human nature, how people communicate. We may
then finally be able to do all those things we have
been trying so hard to do.
In this necessary reconstruction I foresee
that computational linguistics is destined to play
an essential role.
