This paper demonstrates that the polysemy of
the verb grow is a result of natural extension
of individual meanings connoted by its basic
literal meaning and that the polysemy of grow,

This paper claims that the polysemy of the verb
grow is a result of natural extension of meanings
connoted by the basic literal meaning and that the
connotations develop into each independent mean-
ing of grow by requiring different semantic fea-
tures of the arguments. The connotations of the
literal meaning of grow become viable in a new
context of argument structure.
It will be demonstrated that for the computational
treatment of disambiguation, it is not necessary to
exhaust all the features involved in a particular
meaning of grow, but the application of simple
rules of elimination to the argument structure
would be sufficient.
1 I would like to thank Alan Wallington, John Barnde, Mark
Lee and Sheila Glasbey for organizing the workshop entitled
The Lexicon and Figurative Language at ACL 2003 in Sap-
poro, Japan on July 11, 2003. My thanks also go to three
anonymous reviewers for valuable comments. I alone, how-
ever, am responsible for any errors this paper may contain.
The second section will discuss each sense of grow,
focusing on the semantic components of the argu-
ments, and on the relationships among them. I will
demonstrate what is required to disambiguate the
polysemy of grow in the third section, which is
followed by short sections for implications and
conclusion.

2 Relationships of extended meanings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999611777777778">
Viewed by using such thematic roles of verbs as
GOAL and SOURCE, the meanings of the verb
grow shows an interesting relationship among each
other. According to the etymology of the word, the
original sense would be for a plant to germinate
and develop or for a living thing to undergo natural
development, for instance, by increasing in size
and changing physically. The meanings of grow
could be illustrated as below2:

metaphorical process. Therefore, each developed
meaning has the undertone of the basic meaning of
grow.
The characteristic properties of the meaning of
‘grow_proto’ are that the SUBJECT noun phrase
refers to a living thing such as a plant and a human
and that it may take a component that plays a role
of denoting place for both growing and existence.
Such a component is called LOCUS among such
scholars who study the semantic structure of verbs
as Gruber (1965), Starosta (1978) and Ostler
(1980)4.
Unlike the meaning of ‘grow_proto’, the meaning
of ‘grow_appear’ takes the SUBJECT noun phrase
that does not refer to a living thing. Therefore, the
meanings of ‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_appear’ are
complementary in terms of the features of the
SUBJECT noun phrases. In addition, unlike the
reading of ‘grow_proto’, the reading of
‘grow_appear’ does not necessarily require a
LOCUS component having the feature of PLACE,
but the feature of denoting a physical object such
as a face in (2a) would be sufficient. Thus, it could
be stated that the reading of ‘grow_appear’ has less
semantic constraint on the LOCUS component
than that of ‘grow_proto’.
In addition, the reading of ‘grow_appear’ takes a
component indicating source of coming into exis-
tence, which can be called SOURCE because of
the role of indicating the source of action. The
SOURCE element refers to an abstract entity as in
(2c) through (2e). Difference in the semantic fea-
tures of the components in the readings of
‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_appear’ is illustrated in
the following table:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.493367">
4 It should be noted that LOCUS should be distinguished from
LOCATION, which indicates place where AGENT takes ac-
tion. Take the following for instance:
a. He is writing a letter on a letter pad.
b. He is writing a letter in the kitchen.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.8415515">
The phrase on a letter pad functions as LOCUS whereas in the
kitchen, LOCATION.

<bodyText confidence="0.9988862">
Although both readings take the construction in the
form of SUBJECT + GROW + LOCUS, the read-
ing of ‘grow_appear’ needs either the LOCUS or
the SOURCE whereas the reading of ‘grow_proto’
can have the SUBJECT only.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.838043">
B. grow_increase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964196">
The SUBJECT noun phrase of the reading of
‘grow_increase’ refers either to a physical object
or to an abstract object. This reading permits an
interesting interchange of two constructions, as
illustrated below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4446694">
(7)
a. His confidence grew. (= 3a)
(POSSESSOR’s ATTRIBUTE GROW)
b. He grew in confidence. (= 3b)
(POSSESSOR GROW in ATTRIBUTE)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999228">
As (7b) shows, the POSSESSOR component can
be the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the
ATTRIBUTE can appear in the form of in +
ATTRIBUTE. Let us look into the phrase in confi-
dence in (7b). In fact, we find the third construc-
tion somewhat similar in meaning to those in (7a)
and (7b), which is repeated below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.808314222222222">
(8) Confidence grew in him. (= 2b)
Let us use the following conceptual diagrams for
our exploration of the nature of the phrase “in +
ATTRIBUTE”:
5 Parentheses indicate the item inside is optional.
(9)
a. A flower grew in the pot.
b. Confidence grew in him. (= 2b, 8)
c. He grew in confidence. (=3b, 7b)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981875862069">
The two diagrams suggest that in (9a) the part, a
flower, is the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the
whole, the pot, is the LOCUS. Likewise, in (9b)
the part, confidence, is the SUBJECT while the
whole, him, is the LOCUS. Alternatively, by using
Talmy’s (1978) terminology in cognitive psychol-
ogy, we could call the part ‘figure’ and the whole
‘ground’. Moreover, Brugman and Lakoff (1988)
treated the figure as an element in focus and the
ground as an element not in focus in the paper
dealing with prepositions. Drawing on the insight
of previous researchers, I call the thematic role of
the phrase in confidence FOCUS. The FOCUS
element in this construction always appears in the
form of in + FOCUS noun, and the noun refers to
an abstract entity.
Furthermore, the reading of ‘grow_increase’ may
appear with phrases indicating a finishing point of
increase as well as a starting point. As those
phrases are preceded by the prepositions to and
from, I call their thematic roles GOAL and
SOURCE respectively according to the naming
convention of thematic roles. As the examples in
(3c) and (3e) show, the GOAL and SOURCE ele-
ments denote quantities. It should also be noted
that the reading of ‘grow_increase’ does not take
the SOURCE element alone without accompany-
ing the GOAL element. Where there is a SOURCE
element, so is there a GOAL element.

C. grow_change
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935153846154">
The reading of ‘grow_change’ seems to derive by
focusing the aspect of change or development con-
noted by the basic meaning of grow. The
SUBJECT noun phrase refers to an entity that un-
dergoes change of state. The minimum require-
ment of this reading is an element that indicates the
final state of change whether the final state is ex-
pressed as a prepositional phrase as in to manhood
(4a) and into a man (4b), as an adjective as in grew
cold (4c), or as an infinitival phrase as in growing
to hate him (4d). This reading may optionally ap-
pear with an element denoting the initial state of
change, as in from girl to woman in (4e).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.854071">
6 Parentheses indicate the item inside is optional.

<bodyText confidence="0.9945994">
The characteristics of this reading is that the se-
mantic features in the SUBJECT, GOAL and, if
any, SOURCE elements should agree in feature
specification. For instance, in (4b) the semantic
features of boy and man should agree in feature
specification for well-formedness. It is easy to de-
tect some cases of this reading syntactically. Only
this reading permits such a construction as His love
grew cold in (4c) and I am growing to hate him in
(4d). The following table shows semantic features
for the reading of ‘grow_change’ in constructions
other than (4c) and (4d), both of which require a
special syntactic treatment.

D. grow_caused
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970314285714">
The reading of ‘grow_caused’ differs structurally
from the other readings discussed above in that it
requires the component which plays the grammati-
cal role of OBJECT. In other words, grow in this
reading is a transitive verb. This reading is derived
from the reading of ‘grow_proto’ by adding the
AGENT element, and thus it may take the LOCUS
element, as in grew corn in this field (5a). Thus it
is not difficult to distinguish this reading from the
other readings.
To sum up, a combination of connotations of the
literal meaning of ‘grow_proto’ each seems to be-
come a focus and develop into an independent
meaning of grow. The shift of focus has caused the
change of the semantics of the argument, resulting
in a different argument structure from that for the
basic meanig: for instance, the meaning of increase
does not take the LOCUS that denotes place any
longer, but can instead have a FOCUS element that
denotes an abstract entity. Likewise, the GOAL
and SOURCE elements in the reading of
‘grow_increase’ do not denote place, but indicate a
finishing and a starting points of increase respec-
tively. The reading of ‘grow_change’ may have
GOAL and SOURCE elements, but what they
really represent is the final and initial states of
change. Yet, the readings of ‘grow_increase’ and
‘grow_change’ are related to each other, and share
something in common: both events are realized by
growing. All extended meanings carry the under-
tone of the basic meaning with them. These mean-
ings seem to be developed from ‘grow_proto’ as if
cell division takes place. This kind of lexical or-
ganization and extension would reduce memory
load on the learner.

Finally, I would like to make comments on the
computational treatment of the polysemy of grow.
The following table gives an idea of which read-
ings are similar syntactically and semantically and
of what is required to disambiguate the polysemy.
For the computational treatment of disambiguation,
we would not need to exhaust all the features in-
volved in argument structure for each meaning of a
verb, but to have sufficient rules of elimination of
other readings would suffice.
Following is a table showing relationships among
the meanings of grow, which is organized in terms
of grammatical and thematic roles.7

7 I will not include the reading of ‘grow_caused’ because it
has a distintive construction by having the OBJECT, and is
easy to distinguish from the others. In addition, constructions
such as His love grew cold and I am growing to hate him are
not included in this table because these are typical of the rea d-
ing of ‘grow_change’, and are easy to detect syntactically.
8 “=F” means that in this reading the LOCUS element has a
more specific role, FOCUS.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995625">
The construction in the form of SUBJECT +
GROW appears in both readings of ‘grow_proto’
and ‘grow_increase’. Both readings are distin-
guishable from each other by the semantics of the
SUBJECT noun phrases. The SUBJECT noun
phrase in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ requires an
entity referring to a living thing, while that in the
reading of ‘grow_increase’, an abstract entity.
Three readings, ‘grow_proto’, ‘grow_appear’ and
‘grow_increase’ take the form of SUBJECT noun
phrase + GROW + P9 + LOCUS noun phrase; in
particular the last reading in the form of SUBJECT
+ GROW + in + FOCUS noun instead. As the
LOCUS in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ denotes the
PLACE feature and the others do not, the reading
of ‘grow_proto’ can be distinguished from the
other two. Between the remaining two, the reading
of ‘grow_appear’ takes the LOCUS requiring a
physical entity whereas the reading of
‘grow_increase’, an abstract entity.
The readings of ‘grow_incease’ and
‘grow_change’ may appear in the form of
SUBJECT + GROW + to + GOAL or in the form
of SUBJECT + GROW + from + SOURCE + to +
GOAL. They are distinguishable because the
GOAL and SOURCE in the reading of
‘grow_increase’ include features of QUANTITY
while those in the reading of ‘grow_change’ do not.
The readings of ‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_appear’
take the form of SUBJECT + GROW + from +
SOURCE, but while the SOURCE in the reading
of ‘grow_appear’ refers to an abstract entity, that
in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ does not. As men-
tioned above, the two readings are also distin-
guishable in terms of the semantic features of the
SUBJECT noun phrases because the SUBJECT of
the reading of ‘grow_proto’ requires a feature indi-
cating a living thing while that of the reading of
‘grow_appear’ should not.
As discussed above, once rules of elimination are
prepared, it would not be difficult to disambiguate
the polysemy of a word, because the polysemy is
based on the extension of meanings that do not
overlap and the contexts that make the extensions

4 Implications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993090909091">
Interestingly, the hypothesis of the relationship
between the primary sense and other extended
senses in this study differs from that in Tyler and
Evans’ (2001) study on the polysemy of the prepo-
sition over. This study claims that the basic or pri-
mary sense of grow has a combination of
individual connotations such as change of state,
increase and appearance, and that grow acquires a
new sense extended from each individual connota-
tion by allowing a different argument structure. On
the other hand, the primary sense of over proposed
in Tyler and Evans ‘represents a highly idealized
abstraction from our rich recurring experience of
spatial scenes’ and ‘other distinct senses instanti-
ated in the polysemy network for over result from
pragmatic strengthening, i.e. reanalysis and encod-
ing.’ (p. 762) It would be an open question whether
this difference is due to different subject matters,
i.e. between the verb and the preposition, or due to
different approaches, i.e. between computationally
motivated and psycholinguistic approaches.
However, both studies have a common underlying
thesis that the lexicon is highly motivated exhibit-
ing regularities. This is in contrast to the view gen-
erally held by Minimalist linguists that the lexicon
is not organized by general principles (Chomsky
1995).10
The advantage of the analysis of the polysemy of
grow proposed in this study is that it is somewhat
similar to analyses we find in the entries for grow
in dictionaries. This suggests that it might be pos-
sible to use analyses of lexical entries listed in tra-
ditional dictionaries for computational purposes.

mantic features of the arguments. It has demon-
strated that a combination of meanings connoted in
the basic literal meaning each develops into an in-
dependent meaning of grow, attaining a new con-
text that makes the meanig effective. The
polysemy of grow is a natural extension of conno-
tations of its basic meaning. This type of lexical
organization, if this assumption is in the right di-
rection, would have reduced memory load on the
learner. It has also pointed out that for the compu-
tational treatment of disambiguation, it is not nec-
essary to exhaust all the features involved in a
particular reading of the polysemy, but that simple
rules of elimination of other readings should suf-
fice. This claim has been demonstrated by disam-
biguating the polysemy of grow by applying the
rules of elimination to the argument structures,
which are in fact the contexts that make particular
meanings viable.

In addition, unlike the reading of ‘grow_proto’, the reading of ‘grow_appear’ does not necessarily require a LOCUS component having the feature of PLACE, but the feature of denoting a physical object such as a face in (2a) would be sufficient. Thus, it could be stated that the reading of ‘grow_appear’ has less semantic constraint on the LOCUS component than that of ‘grow_proto’. In addition, the reading of ‘grow_appear’ takes a component indicating source of coming into existence, which can be called SOURCE because of the role of indicating the source of action. The SOURCE element refers to an abstract entity as in (2c) through (2e). Difference in the semantic features of the components in the readings of ‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_appear’ is illustrated in the following table: should be noted that LOCUS should be distinguished from LOCATION, which indicates place where AGENT takes action. Take the following for instance: a. He is writing a letter on a letter pad. b. He is writing a letter in the kitchen. phrase a letter pad as LOCUS whereas the LOCATION. (6) a. grow_proto + GROW (+ LOCUS or b. grow_appear SUBJECT + GROW + LOCUS or SOURCE readings semantics of semantics of semantics of SUBJECT LOCUS SOURCE grow_proto living thing place place grow_appear non-living thing physical entity abstract entity Although both readings take the construction in the form of SUBJECT + GROW + LOCUS, the reading of ‘grow_appear’ needs either the LOCUS or the SOURCE whereas the reading of ‘grow_proto’ can have the SUBJECT only. B. grow_increase The SUBJECT noun phrase of the reading of ‘grow_increase’ refers either to a physical object or to an abstract object. This reading permits an interesting interchange of two constructions, as illustrated below: (7) a. His confidence grew. (= 3a) GROW) b. He grew in confidence. (= 3b) GROW As (7b) shows, the POSSESSOR component can be the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the can appear in the form of Let us look into the phrase confi- (7b). In fact, we find the third construction somewhat similar in meaning to those in (7a) and (7b), which is repeated below: (8) Confidence grew in him. (= 2b) Let us use the following conceptual diagrams for exploration of the nature of the phrase ATTRIBUTE”: indicate the item inside is optional. (9) a. A flower grew in the pot. b. Confidence grew in him. (= 2b, 8) c. He grew in confidence. (=3b, 7b) two diagrams suggest that in (9a) the part, is the SUBJECT of the sentence, and the is the LOCUS. Likewise, in (9b) part, is the SUBJECT while the is the LOCUS. Alternatively, by using Talmy’s (1978) terminology in cognitive psychology, we could call the part ‘figure’ and the whole ‘ground’. Moreover, Brugman and Lakoff (1988) treated the figure as an element in focus and the ground as an element not in focus in the paper dealing with prepositions. Drawing on the insight of previous researchers, I call the thematic role of phrase confidence The FOCUS element in this construction always appears in the of FOCUS noun, and the noun refers to an abstract entity. Furthermore, the reading of ‘grow_increase’ may appear with phrases indicating a finishing point of increase as well as a starting point. As those are preceded by the prepositions I call their thematic roles GOAL and SOURCE respectively according to the naming convention of thematic roles. As the examples in (3c) and (3e) show, the GOAL and SOURCE elements denote quantities. It should also be noted that the reading of ‘grow_increase’ does not take the SOURCE element alone without accompanying the GOAL element. Where there is a SOURCE element, so is there a GOAL element. flower pot confidence him Thus, we need three-fold constructions in this reading, as illustrated below; (10) grow_increase (a) SUBJECT+ GROW (a) FOCUS GOAL (finishing point) SOURCE (starting point) of SUBJECT (possessor’s attribute) abstract entity (None) (None) (None) SUBJECT + GROW + FOCUS (b) semantics of SUBJECT (possessor) FOCUS (attribute) GOAL (finishing point) SOURCE (starting point) abstract or abstract entity (None) (None) physical entity SUBJECT + GROW (+ FOCUS) + GOAL (c) semantics FOCUS (attribute) GOAL (finishing point) SOURCE (starting point) of SUBJECT abstract or abstract entity quantity quantity physical entity C. grow_change The reading of ‘grow_change’ seems to derive by focusing the aspect of change or development conby the basic meaning of The SUBJECT noun phrase refers to an entity that undergoes change of state. The minimum requirement of this reading is an element that indicates the final state of change whether the final state is exas a prepositional phrase as in manhood and a man as an adjective as in or as an infinitival phrase as in hate him This reading may optionally appear with an element denoting the initial state of as in girl to woman (4e). indicate the item inside is optional. The characteristics of this reading is that the semantic features in the SUBJECT, GOAL and, if any, SOURCE elements should agree in feature specification. For instance, in (4b) the semantic of agree in feature specification for well-formedness. It is easy to detect some cases of this reading syntactically. Only reading permits such a construction as love cold (4c) and am growing to hate him (4d). The following table shows semantic features for the reading of ‘grow_change’ in constructions other than (4c) and (4d), both of which require a special syntactic treatment. (11) grow_change (requiring the feature agreement among the three roles) semantics of semantics of semantics of SUBJECT GOAL (re- SOURCE (op-tional element) quired element) physical entity physical entity physical entity abstract entity abstract entity abstract entity D. grow_caused The reading of ‘grow_caused’ differs structurally from the other readings discussed above in that it requires the component which plays the grammatirole of OBJECT. In other words, this reading is a transitive verb. This reading is derived from the reading of ‘grow_proto’ by adding the AGENT element, and thus it may take the LOCUS as in corn in this field Thus it is not difficult to distinguish this reading from the other readings. To sum up, a combination of connotations of the literal meaning of ‘grow_proto’ each seems to become a focus and develop into an independent of The shift of focus has caused the change of the semantics of the argument, resulting in a different argument structure from that for the basic meanig: for instance, the meaning of increase does not take the LOCUS that denotes place any longer, but can instead have a FOCUS element that denotes an abstract entity. Likewise, the GOAL and SOURCE elements in the reading of ‘grow_increase’ do not denote place, but indicate a finishing and a starting points of increase respectively. The reading of ‘grow_change’ may have GOAL and SOURCE elements, but what they really represent is the final and initial states of change. Yet, the readings of ‘grow_increase’ and ‘grow_change’ are related to each other, and share something in common: both events are realized by growing. All extended meanings carry the undertone of the basic meaning with them. These meanings seem to be developed from ‘grow_proto’ as if cell division takes place. This kind of lexical organization and extension would reduce memory load on the learner. 3 For computational treatment Finally, I would like to make comments on the treatment of the polysemy of The following table gives an idea of which readings are similar syntactically and semantically and of what is required to disambiguate the polysemy. For the computational treatment of disambiguation, we would not need to exhaust all the features involved in argument structure for each meaning of a verb, but to have sufficient rules of elimination of other readings would suffice. Following is a table showing relationships among meanings of which is organized in terms grammatical and thematic (12) Meanings Just SUBJ L G G&amp;S S grow_proto ok ok ok grow_appear ok ok grow_increase ok ok ok ok grow_change ok ok L=LOCUS, F=FOCUS, G=GOAL, G&amp;S = GOAL &amp; SOURCE, S=SOURCE will not include the reading of ‘grow_caused’ because it has a distintive construction by having the OBJECT, and is easy to distinguish from the others. In addition, constructions as love grew cold am growing to hate him not included in this table because these are typical of the rea ding of ‘grow_change’, and are easy to detect syntactically. means that in this reading the LOCUS element has a more specific role, FOCUS. The construction in the form of SUBJECT + GROW appears in both readings of ‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_increase’. Both readings are distinguishable from each other by the semantics of the SUBJECT noun phrases. The SUBJECT noun phrase in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ requires an entity referring to a living thing, while that in the reading of ‘grow_increase’, an abstract entity. Three readings, ‘grow_proto’, ‘grow_appear’ and ‘grow_increase’ take the form of SUBJECT noun + GROW + + LOCUS noun phrase; in particular the last reading in the form of SUBJECT GROW + FOCUS noun instead. As the LOCUS in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ denotes the PLACE feature and the others do not, the reading of ‘grow_proto’ can be distinguished from the other two. Between the remaining two, the reading of ‘grow_appear’ takes the LOCUS requiring a physical entity whereas the reading of ‘grow_increase’, an abstract entity. The readings of ‘grow_incease’ and ‘grow_change’ may appear in the form of + GROW + GOAL or in the form SUBJECT + GROW + SOURCE + GOAL. They are distinguishable because the GOAL and SOURCE in the reading of ‘grow_increase’ include features of QUANTITY while those in the reading of ‘grow_change’ do not. The readings of ‘grow_proto’ and ‘grow_appear’ the form of SUBJECT + GROW + SOURCE, but while the SOURCE in the reading of ‘grow_appear’ refers to an abstract entity, that in the reading of ‘grow_proto’ does not. As mentioned above, the two readings are also distinguishable in terms of the semantic features of the SUBJECT noun phrases because the SUBJECT of the reading of ‘grow_proto’ requires a feature indicating a living thing while that of the reading of ‘grow_appear’ should not. As discussed above, once rules of elimination are prepared, it would not be difficult to disambiguate the polysemy of a word, because the polysemy is based on the extension of meanings that do not overlap and the contexts that make the extensions stands for preposition. viable should not overlap either. The contexts in the case of verbs are the argument structures. 4 Implications Interestingly, the hypothesis of the relationship between the primary sense and other extended senses in this study differs from that in Tyler and Evans’ (2001) study on the polysemy of the prepo- This study claims that the basic or prisense of a combination of individual connotations such as change of state, and appearance, and that a new sense extended from each individual connotation by allowing a different argument structure. On other hand, the primary sense of in Tyler and Evans ‘represents a highly idealized abstraction from our rich recurring experience of spatial scenes’ and ‘other distinct senses instantiin the polysemy network for from pragmatic strengthening, i.e. reanalysis and encoding.’ (p. 762) It would be an open question whether this difference is due to different subject matters, i.e. between the verb and the preposition, or due to different approaches, i.e. between computationally motivated and psycholinguistic approaches. However, both studies have a common underlying thesis that the lexicon is highly motivated exhibiting regularities. This is in contrast to the view generally held by Minimalist linguists that the lexicon is not organized by general principles (Chomsky The advantage of the analysis of the polysemy of in this study is that it is somewhat to analyses we find in the entries for in dictionaries. This suggests that it might be possible to use analyses of lexical entries listed in traditional dictionaries for computational purposes. 5 Conclusion This paper has discussed the relationships of the of the verb examining the sestudy of the lexicon and in particular the semantic polysemy has never been a subject of serious linguistic research in the framework of Generative Linguistics. As the study of the lexicon has been scarce and the research has to cover a vast realm of linguistic data and activities, this field is in dire need of future research. mantic features of the arguments. It has demonstrated that a combination of meanings connoted in the basic literal meaning each develops into an inmeaning of attaining a new context that makes the meanig effective. The of a natural extension of connotations of its basic meaning. This type of lexical organization, if this assumption is in the right direction, would have reduced memory load on the learner. It has also pointed out that for the computational treatment of disambiguation, it is not necessary to exhaust all the features involved in a particular reading of the polysemy, but that simple rules of elimination of other readings should suffice. This claim has been demonstrated by disamthe polysemy of applying the rules of elimination to the argument structures, which are in fact the contexts that make particular meanings viable.</abstract>
