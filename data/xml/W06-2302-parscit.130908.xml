In this paper we will present an evaluation of
current state-of-the-art algorithms for Anaphora
Resolution based on a segment of Susanne
corpus (itself a portion of Brown Corpus), a
much more comparable text type to what is
usually required at an international level for
such application domains as
Question/Answering, Information Extraction,
Text Understanding, Language Learning. The
portion of text chosen has an adequate size
which lends itself to significant statistical
measurements: it is portion A, counting 35,000
tokens and some 1000 third person pronominal
expressions. The algorithms will then be
compared to our system, GETARUNS, which
incorporates an AR algorithm at the end of a
pipeline of interconnected modules that
instantiate standard architectures for NLP. F-
measure values reached by our system are
significantly higher (75%) than the other ones.

<bodyText confidence="0.999951547619047">
The problem of anaphora resolution (hence AR)
looms more and more as a prominent one in
unrestricted text processing due to the need to
recover semantically consistent information in most
current NLP applications. This problem does not
lend itself easily to a statistical approach so that
rule-based approaches seem the only viable
solution.
We present a new evaluation of three state-of-the-art
algorithms for anaphora resolution – GuiTAR,
JavaRAP, MARS – on the basis of a portion of
Susan Corpus (derived from Brown Corpus) a much
richer testbed than the ones previously used for
evaluation, and in any case a much more
comparable source with such texts as newspaper
articles and stories. Texts used previously ranged
from scientific manuals to descriptive scientific
texts and were generally poor on pronouns and rich
on nominal descriptions. Two of the algorithms –
GuiTAR and JavaRAP - use Charniak’s parser
output, which contributes to the homogeneity of the
type of knowledge passed to the resolution
procedure. MARS, on the contrary, uses a more
sophisticated input, the one provided by Connexor
FDG-parser. The algorithms will then be compared
to our system, GETARUNS, which incorporated an
AR algorithm at the end of a pipeline of
interconnected modules that instantiate standard
architectures for NLP. The version of the algorithm
presented here is a newly elaborated one, and is
devoted to unrestricted text processing. It is an
upgraded version from the one discussed in
Delmonte (1999;2002a;2002b) and tries to
incorporate as much as possible of the more
sophisticated version implemented in the complete
GETARUN (see Delmonte 1990;1991;1992;1994;
2003;2004).
The paper is organized as follows: in section 2
below we briefly discuss architectures and criteria
for AR of the three algorithms evaluated. In section
3 we present our system. Section 4 is dedicated to a
compared evaluation and a general discussion.

2 The Anaphora Resolution Algorithms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990805">
We start by presenting a brief overview of three
state-of-the-art algorithms for anaphora resolution –
GuiTAR, JavaRAP, MARS.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.618615">
2.1 JavaRAP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829545454545">
As reported by the authors (Long Qiu, Min-Yen
Kan, Tat-Seng Chua, 2004) of the JAVA
implementation, head-dependent relations required
by RAP are provided by looking into the structural
“argument domain” for arguments and into the
structural “adjunct domain” for adjuncts. Domain
information is important to establish disjunction
relations, i.e. to tell whether a third person pronoun
can look for antecedents within a certain structural
domain or not. According to Binding Principles,
Anaphors (i.e. reciprocal and reflexive pronouns),
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996955">
3
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716060606061">
must be bound – search for their binder-antecedent –
in their same binding domain – roughly
corresponding to the notion of structural
“argument/adjunct domain”. Within the same
domains, Pronouns must be free. Head-argument or
head-adjunct relation is determined whenever two or
more NPs are sibling of the same VP.
Additional information is related to agreement
features, which in the case of pronominal
expressions are directly derived. As for nominal
expressions, features are expressed in case they are
either available on the verb – for SUBJect NPs– or
else if they are expressed on the noun and some
other tricks are performed for conjoined nouns.
Gender is looked up in the list of names available on
the web. This list is also used to provide the
semantic feature of animacy.
RAP is also used to find pleonastic pronouns, i.e.
pronouns which have no referents. To detect
conditions for pleonastic pronouns a list of patterns
is indicated, which used both lexical and structural
information.
Salience weight is produced for each candidate
antecedent from a set of salience factors. These
factors include main Grammatical Relations,
Headedness, non Adverbiality, belonging to the
same sentence. The information is computed again
by RAP, directly on the syntactic structure. The
weight computed for each noun phrase is divided by
two in case the distance from the current sentence
increases. Only NPs contained within a distance of
three sentences preceding the anaphor are
considered by JavaRAP.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991309">
2.2 GuiTAR
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986981081081">
The authors (Poesio, M. and Mijail A. Kabadjov
2004) present their algorithm as an attempt at
providing a domain independent anaphora
resolution module, “that developers of NLE
applications can pick off the shelf in the way of
tokenizers, POS taggers, parsers, or Named
Entity classifiers”. For these reasons, GuiTAR has
been designed to be as independent as possible from
other modules, and to be as modular as possible,
thus “allowing for the possibility of replacing
specific components (e.g., the pronoun resolution
component)”.
The authors have also made an attempt at specifying
what they call the Minimal Anaphoric Syntax
(MAS) and have devised a markup language based
on GNOME mark-up scheme. In MAS, Nominal
Expressions constitute the main processing units,
and are identified with the tag NE &lt;ne&gt;, which have
a CAT attribute, specifying the NP type: the-np,
pronoun etc., as well as Person, Number and Gender
attributes for agreement features. Also the internal
structure of the NP is marked with Mod and
NPHead tags.
The pre-processing phase uses a syntactic guesser
which is a chunker of NPs based on heuristics. All
NEs add up to a discourse model – or better History
List - which is then used as the basic domain where
Discourse Segments are contained. Each Discourse
Segment in turn may be constituted by one or more
Utterances. Each Utterance in turn contains a list of
forward looking centers Cfs.
The Anaphora Resolution algorithm implemented is
the one proposed by MARS which will be
commented below. The authors also implemented a
simple algorithm for resolving Definite Descriptions
on the basis of the History List by a same head
matching approach.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93281">
2.3 MARS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980063921052631">
The approach is presented as a knowledge poor
anaphora resolution algorithm (Mitkov R.
[1995;1998]), which makes use of POS and NP
chunking, it tries to individuate pleonastic “it”
occurrences, and assigns animacy. The weighting
algorithm seems to contain the most original
approach. It is organized with a filtering approach
by a series of indicators that are used to boost or
reduce the score for antecedenthood to a given NP.
The indicators are the following ones:
FNP (First NP); INDEF (Indefinite NP); IV
(Indicating Verbs); REI (Lexical Reiteration); SH
(Section Heading Preference); CM (Collocation
Match); PNP (Prepositional Noun Phrases); IR
(Immediate Reference); SI (Sequential Instructions);
RD (Referential Distance); TP (Term Preference),
As the author comments, antecedent indicators
(preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down
the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
Candidates are assigned a score (-1, 0, 1 or 2) for
each indicator; the candidate with the highest
aggregate score is proposed as the antecedent.
The authors comment is that antecedent indicators
have been identified empirically and are related
to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating
verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading
preference, &amp;quot;non- prepositional&amp;quot; noun phrases), to
structural matches (collocation, immediate
reference), to referential distance or to preference
of terms. However it is clear that most of the
indicators have been suggested for lack of better
information, in particular no syntactic constituency
was available.
In a more recent paper (Mitkov et al., 2003) MARS
has been fully reimplemented and the indicators
updated. The authors seem to acknowledge the fact
that anaphora resolution is a much more difficult
task than previous work had suggested, In
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999958048780488">
unrestricted text analysis, the tasks involved in the
anaphora resolution process contribute a lot of
uncertainty and errors that may be the cause for low
performance measures.
The actual algorithm uses the output of Connexor’s
FDG Parser, filters instances of “it” and eliminates
pleonastic cases, then produces a list of potential
antecedents by extracting nominal and pronominal
heads from NPs preceding the pronoun. Constraints
are then applied to this list in order to produce the
“set of competing candidates” to be considered
further, i.e. those candidates that agree in number
and gender with the pronoun, and also obey
syntactic constraints. They also introduced the use
of Genetic Algorithms in the evaluation phase.
The new version of MARS includes three new
indicators which seem more general and applicable
to any text, so we shall comment on them.
Frequent Candidates (FC) – this is a boosting score
for most frequent three NPs; Syntactic Parallelism
(SP) – this is a boosting score for NPs with the same
syntactic role as the pronoun, roles provided by the
FDG-Parser; Boost Pronoun (BP) – pronoun
candidates are given a bonus (no indication of
conditions for such a bonus).
The authors also reimplemented in a significant way
the indicator First NPs which has been renamed,
“Obliqueness (OBL) – score grammatical functions,
SUBJect &gt; OBJect &gt; IndirectOBJect &gt; Undefined”.
MARS has a procedure for automatically identifying
pleonastic pronouns: the classification is done by
means of 35 features organized into 6 types and are
expressed by a mixture of lexical and grammatical
heuristics. The output should be a fine-grained
characterization of the phenomenon of the use of
pleonastic pronouns which includes, among others,
discourse anaphora, clause level anaphora and
idiomatic cases.
In the same paper, the authors deal with two more
important topics: syntactic constraints and animacy
identification.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999632573529412">
In a number of papers (Delmonte 1990;1991;
1992;1994; 2003;2004) and in a book (Delmonte
1992) we described our algorithms and the
theoretical background which inspired it. Whereas
the old version of the system had a limited
vocabulary and was intended to work only in limited
domains with high precision, the current version of
the system has been created to cope with
unrestricted text. In Delmonte (2002), we reported
preliminary results obtained on a corpus of
anaphorically annotated texts made available by
R.Mitkov on his website. Both definite descriptions
and pronominal expressions were considered,
success rate was at 75% F-measure. In those case
we used a very shallow and robust parser which
produced only NP chunks which were then used to
fire anaphoric processes. However the texts making
up the corpus were technical manuals, where the
scope and usage of pronominal expressions is very
limited.
The current algorithm for anaphora resolution works
on the output of a complete deep robust parser
which builds an indexed linear list of dependency
structures where clause boundaries are clearly
indicated; differently from Connexor, our system
elaborates both grammatical relations and semantic
roles information for arguments and adjuncts.
Semantic roles are very important in the weighting
procedures. Our system also produces implicit
grammatical relations which are either controlled
SUBJects of untensed clauses, arguments or
adjuncts of relative clauses.
As to the anaphoric resolution algorithm, it is based
on the original Sidner’s (1983:Chapter 5) and
Webber’s (1983:Chapter 6) intuitions on Focussing
in Discourse. We find distributed, local approaches
to anaphora resolution more efficient than
monolithic, global ones. In particular we believe
that due to the relevance of structural constraints in
the treatment of locally restricted classes of
pronominal expressions, it is more appropriate to
activate different procedures which by dealing
separately with non-locally restricted classes also
afford separate evaluation procedures. There are
also at least two principled reasons for the
separation into two classes.
The first reason is a theoretical one. Linguistic
theory has long since established without any doubt
the existence in most languages of the world of at
least two classes: the class of pronouns which must
be bound locally in a given domain and the class of
pronouns which must be left free in the same
domain – as a matter of fact, English also has a third
class of pronominals, the so-called long-distance
subject-of-consciousness bound pronouns (see
Zribi-Hertz A., 1989);
The second reason is empirical. Anaphora resolution
is usually carried out by searching antecedents
backward w.r.t. the position of the current anaphoric
expression. In our approach, we proceed in a clause
by clause fashion, weighting each candidate
antecedent w.r.t. that domain, trying to resolve it
locally. Weighting criteria are amenable on the one
hand to linear precedence constraints, with scores
assigned on a functional/semantic basis. On the
other hand, these criteria may be overrun by a
functional ranking of clauses which requires to treat
main clauses differently from secondary clauses,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.965751">
5
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941">
and these two differently from complement clauses.
On the contrary, global algorithms neglect
altogether such requirements: they weight each
referring expression w.r.t. the utterance, linear
precedence is only physically evaluated, no
functional correction is introduced.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999256">
3.1 Referential Policies and Algorithms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848361702128">
There are also two general referential policy
assumption that we adopt in our approach: The first
one is related to pronominal expressions, the second
one to referring expressions or entities to be asserted
in the History List, and are expressed as follows:
- no more than two pronominal expressions are
allowed to refer back in the previous discourse
portion;
- at discourse level, referring expressions are
stored in a push-down stack according to
Persistence principles.
Persistence principles respond to psychological
principles and limit the topicality space available to
user w.r.t. a given text. It has a bidimensional
nature: it is determined both in relation to an overall
topicality frequency value and to an utterance
number proximity value.
Only “persistent” referring expressions are allowed
to build up the History List, where persistence is
established on the basis of the frequency of
topicality for each referring expression which must
be higher than 1. All referring expression asserted as
Topic (Secondary, Potential) only once are
discarded in case they appeared at a distance
measured in 5 previous utterances. Proximate
referring expressions are allowed to be asserted in
the History List.
In particular, if Mitkov considers the paragraph as
the discourse unit most suitable for coreferring and
cospecifying operation at discourse level, we prefer
to adopt a parameterized procedure which is
definable by the user and activated automatically: it
can be fired within a number that can vary from
every 10 up to 50 sentences. Our procedure has the
task to prune the topicality space and reduce the
number of perspective topic for Main and
Secondary Topic. Thus we garbage-collect all non-
relevant entities. This responds to the empirically
validated fact that as the distance between first and
second mention of the same referring expression
increases, people are obliged to repeat the same
linguistic description, using a definite expression or
a bare NP. Indefinites are unallowed and may only
serve as first mention; they can also be used as
bridging expression within opaque propositions. The
first procedure is organized as follows:
A. For each clause,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.937471466666667">
1. we collect all referential expressions and
weight them (see B below for criteria) – this
is followed by an automatic ranking;
2. then we subtract pronominal expressions;
3. at clause level, we try to bind personal and
possessive pronouns obeying specific
structural properties; we also bind reflexive
pronouns and reciprocals if any, which must
be bound obligatorily in this domain;
4. when binding a pronoun, we check for
disjointness w.r.t. a previously bound
pronoun if any;
5. all unbound pronouns and all remaining
personal pronouns are asserted as
“externals”, and are passed up to the higher
clause levels;
B. Weighting is carried out by taking into account
the following linguistic properties associated to each
referring expression:
1. Grammatical Function with usual hierarchy
(SUBJ &gt; ARG_MOD &gt; OBJ &gt; OBJ2 &gt; IOBJ &gt;
NCMOD);
2. Semantic Roles, as they have been labelled in
FrameNet, and in our manually produced
frequency lexicon of English;
3. Animacy: we use 75 semantic features derived
from WordNet, and reward Human and
Institution/Company labelled referring
expressions;
4. Functional Clause Type is further used to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998921962962963">
introduce penalties associated to those referring
expressions which don’t belong to main clause.
C. Then we turn at the higher level – if any -, and
we proceed as in A., in addition
1. we try to bind pronouns passed up by the lower
clause levels
o if successful, this will activate a retract of the
“external” label and a label of
“antecedenthood” for the current pronoun
with a given antecedent;
o the best antecedent is chosen by recursively
trying to match features of the pronoun with
the first available antecedent previously
ranked by weighting;
o here again whenever a pronoun is bound we
check for disjointness at utterance level.
D. This is repeated until all clauses are examined
and all pronouns are scrutinised and bound or left
free.
E. Pronouns left free – those asserted as externals –
will be matched tentatively with the best candidates
provided this time by a “centering-like” algorithm.
Step A. is identical and is recursively repeated until
all clauses are processed.
Then, we move to step B. which in this case will use
all referring expressions present in the utterance,
rather than only those available locally.

3.2 Focussing Revisited
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975727272727">
Our version of the focussing algorithm follows
Sidner’s proposal (Sidner C., 1983; Grosz B., Sidner
C., 1986), to use a Focus Stack, a certain Focus
Algorithm with Focus movements and data
structures to allow for processing simple inferential
relations between different linguistic descriptions
co-specifying or coreferring to a given entity.
Our Focus Algorithm is organized as follows: for
each utterance, we assert three “centers” that we call
Main, Secondary and the first Potential Topic,
which represent the best three referring expressions
as they have been weighted in the candidate list
used for pronominal binding; then we also keep a
list of Potential Topics for the remaining best
candidates. These three best candidates repositories
are renovated at each new utterance, and are used
both to resolve pronominal and nominal
cospecification and coreference: this is done both in
case of strict identity of linguistic description and of
non-identity. The second case may occur either
when derivational morphological properties allow
the two referring expressions to be matched
successfully, or when a simple hyponym/hypernym
relation is entertained by two terms, one of which is
contained in the list of referring expressions
collected from the current sentence, and the other is
among one of the entities stored in the focus list.
The Main Topic may be regarded the Forward
Looking Center in the centering terminology or the
Current Focus. All entities are stored in the History
List (HL) which is a stack containing their
morphological and semantic features: this is not to
be confused with a Discourse Model - what we did
in the deep complete system anaphora resolution
module – which is a highly semantically wrought
elaboration of the current text. In the HL every new
entity is assigned a semantic index which identifies
it uniquely. To allow for Persistence evaluation, we
also assert rhetorical properties associated to each
entity, i.e. we store the information of topicality (i.e.
whether it has been evaluated as Main, Secondary or
Potential Topic), together with the semantic ID and
the number of the current utterance. This is
subsequently used to measure the degree of
Persistence in the overall text of a given entity, as
explained below.
In order to decide which entity has to become Main,
Secondary or Potential Topic we proceed as
follows:
- we collect all entities present in the History List
with their semantic identifier and feature list
and proceed to an additional weighting
procedure;
- nominal expressions, they are divided up into
four semantic types: definite, indefinite, bare
NPs, quantified NPs. Both definite and
indefinite NP may be computed as new or old
entity according to contextual conditions as
will be discussed below and are given a
rewarding score;
- we enumerate for each entity its persistence in
the previous text, and keep entities which have
frequency higher than 1, we discard the others;
- we recover entities which have been asserted in
the HL in proximity to the current utterance, up
to four utterances back;
- we use this list to “resolve” referring
expressions contained in the current utterance;
- if this succeeds, we use the “resolved” entities
as new Main, Secondary, and Potential Topics
and assert the rest in the Potential Topics stack;
- if this fails – also partially – we use the best
candidates in the weighted list of referring
expressions to assert the new Topics. It may be
the case that both resolved and current best
candidates are used, and this is by far the most
common case.

4. Evaluation and General Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874295081968">
Evaluating anaphora resolution systems calls for a
reformulation of the usual parameters of Precision
and Recall as introduced in IR/IE field: in that case,
there are two levels that are used as valuable results;
a first stage where systems are measured for their
capacity to retrieve/extract relevant items from the
corpus/web (coverage-recall). Then a second stage
follows in which systems are evaluated for their
capacity to match the content of the query
(accuracy-precision). In the field of IR/IE items to
be matched are usually constituted by words/phrases
and pattern-matching procedures are the norm.
However, for AR systems this is not sufficient and
NLP heavy techniques are used to get valuable
results. As Mitkov also notes, this phase jeopardizes
the capacity of AR systems to reach satisfactory
accuracy scores simply because of its intrinsic
weakness: none of the off-the-shelf parsers currently
available overcomes 90% accuracy.
To clarify these issues, we present here below two
Tables: in the first one we report data related to the
vexed question of whether pleonastic “it” should be
regarded as part of the task of anaphora resolution
or rather part of a separate classification task – as
suggested in a number of papers by Mitkov. In the
former case, they should contribute to the overall
anaphora resolution evaluation metrics; in the latter
case they should be compute separately as a case of
classification over all occurrences of “it” in the
current dataset and discarded from the overall count.
Even though we don’t agree fully with Mitkov’s
position, we find it useful to deal with “it” separate,
due to its high inherent ambiguity. Besides, it is true
that the AR task is not like any Information
Retrieval task.
In Table 1 below we reported figures for “it” in
order to evaluate the three algorithms in relation to
the classification task. Then in Table 2. we report
general data where we computed the two types of
accuracy reported in the literature. In Table 1 we
split results for “it” into Wrong Reference vs Wrong
Classification: following Mitkov, in case we only
computed anaphora related cases and disregarded
those cases of “it” which were wrongly classified as
expletives. Expletive “it” present in the text are 189:
so at first we computed coverage and accuracy with
the usual formula that we report below. Then we
subtracted wrongly classified cases from the number
of total “it” found in one case (following Mitkov
who claims that wrongly classified “it” found by the
system should not count; in another case, this
number is subtracted from the total number of “it”
to be found in the text. Only for MARS we then
computed different measures of Coverage and
Accuracy. If we regard this approach worth
pursuing, we come up with two Adjusted Accuracy
measures which are related to the revised total
numbers of anaphors by the two subtractions
indicated above.
We computed manually all third person pronominal
expressions and came up with a figure 982 which is

In absolute terms best accuracy figures have been
obtained by GETARUNS, followed by JavaRAP. So
it is still thanks to the classic Recall formula that
this result stands out clearly. We also produced
another table which can however only be worked
out for our system, which uses a distributed
approach. We managed to separate pronominal
expressions in relation to their contribution at the
different levels of anaphora resolution considered:
clause level, utterance level, discourse level. At
clause level, only those pronouns which must be
bound locally are checked, as is the case with
reflexive pronouns, possessives, some cases of
expletive ‘it’: both arguments and adjuncts may
contribute the appropriate antecedent. At utterance
level, in case the sentence is complex or there is
more than one clause, also personal subject/object
pronouns may be bound (if only preferentially so).
Eventually, those pronouns which do not find an
antecedent are regarded discourse level pronouns.
We collapsed under CLAUSE all pronouns bound at
clause and utterance level; DISCOURSE contains
only sentence external pronouns. Expletives have
been computed in a separate column.

<bodyText confidence="0.999671384615384">
As can be noticed easily, the highest percentage of
pronouns found is at Clause level: this is not
however the best performance of the system, which
on the contrary performs better at discourse level.
Expletives contribute by far the highest correct
result. We also found correctly 47 ‘there’ expletives
and 6 correctly classified pronominal ‘there’ which
however have been left unbound. The system also
found 48 occurrences of deictic discourse bound
“this” and “that”, which corresponds to the full
coverage.
Finally, nominal expressions: the History List (HL)
has been incremented up to 2243 new entities. The
system identified 2773 entities from the HL by
matching their linguistic description. The overall
number of resolution actions taken by the Discourse
Level algorithm is 1861: this includes both cases of
nominal and pronominal expressions. However,
since only 366 can be pronouns, the remaining 1500
resolution actions have been carried out on nominal
expressions present in the HL. If we compare these
results to the ones computed by GuiTAR, which
assign semantic indices to NamedEntities
disregarding their status of anaphora, we can see
that the whole text is made up of 12731 NEs.
GuiTAR finds 1585 cases of identity relations
between a NE and an antecedent. However,
GuiTAR introduces always new indices and creates
local antecedent-referring expression chains rather
than repeating the same index of the chain head. In
this way, it is difficult if not impossible to compute
how many times the text corefers/cospecifies to the
same referring expressions. On the contrary, in our
case, this can be easily computed by counting how
many times the same semantic index is being
repeated in a “resolution” or “identity” action of the
anaphora resolution algorithm. For instance, the
Jury is coreferred/cospecified 12 times; Price Daniel
also 12 times and so on.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984111111111">
The error rate of both Charniak’s and Connexor’s as
reported in the literature, is approximately the same,
20%; this notwithstanding, MARS has a slightly
reduced coverage when compared with JavaRAP,
96%. GuiTAR has the worst coverage, 85%. As to
accuracy, none of the three algorithms overruns
50%: JavaRAP has the best score 49.9%. However
GETARUNS has 63% correct score, with 90%
coverage.
There are at least three reasons why our system has a
better performance: one is the presence of a richer
functional and semantic information as explained
above, which comes with augmented head-
dependent structures. Second reason is the decision
to split the referential process into two and treat
utterance level pronominal expressions separately
from discourse level ones. Third reason is the way
in which discourse level anaphora resolution is

organized: our version of the Centering algorithm
hinges on a record of a list of best antecedents
weighted on the basis of their behaviour in History
List and on their intrinsic semantic properties. These
three properties of our AR algorithm can be dubbed
the Knowledge Rich approach.
F-measures approximates very closely what we
obtained in a previous experiment: however, as a
whole it is an insufficient score to insure adequate
confidence in semantic substitution of anaphoric
items by the head of the antecedent. Improvements
need to come from parsing and the lexical
component.

The portion of text chosen has an adequate size which lends itself to significant statistical measurements: it is portion A, counting 35,000 tokens and some 1000 third person pronominal expressions. The algorithms will then be compared to our system, GETARUNS, which incorporates an AR algorithm at the end of a pipeline of interconnected modules that instantiate standard architectures for NLP. Fmeasure values reached by our system are significantly higher (75%) than the other ones.</abstract>

The algorithms will then be compared to our system, GETARUNS, which incorporated an AR algorithm at the end of a pipeline of interconnected modules that instantiate standard architectures for NLP. The version of the algorithm presented here is a newly elaborated one, and is devoted to unrestricted text processing. It is an upgraded version from the one discussed in Delmonte (1999;2002a;2002b) and tries to incorporate as much as possible of the more sophisticated version implemented in the complete GETARUN (see Delmonte 1990;1991;1992;1994; 2003;2004). The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 below we briefly discuss architectures and criteria for AR of the three algorithms evaluated. In section 3 we present our system. Section 4 is dedicated to a compared evaluation and a general discussion. 2 The Anaphora Resolution Algorithms We start by presenting a brief overview of three state-of-the-art algorithms for anaphora resolution – GuiTAR, JavaRAP, MARS. 2.1 JavaRAP As reported by the authors (Long Qiu, Min-Yen Kan, Tat-Seng Chua, 2004) of the JAVA implementation, head-dependent relations required by RAP are</context>
