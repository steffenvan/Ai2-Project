Historically, suicide risk assessment has re-
lied on question-and-answer type tools. These
tools, built on psychometric advances, are
widely used because of availability. Yet there
is no known tool based on biologic and cogni-
tive evidence. This absence often cause a vex-
ing clinical problem for clinicians who ques-
tion the value of the result as time passes. The
purpose of this paper is to describe one exper-
iment in a series of experiments to develop a
tool that combines Biological Markers (B,..)
with Thought Markers (Try,.), and use machine
learning to compute a real-time index for as-
sessing the likelihood repeated suicide attempt
in the next six-months. For this study we fo-
cus using unsupervised machine learning to
distinguish between actual suicide notes and
newsgroups. This is important because it gives
us insight into how well these methods dis-
criminate between real notes and general con-
versation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998093711111111">
It is estimated that each year 800,000 die by suicide
worldwide (World Health Organization, 2001). In
the United States, suicide ranks second as the lead-
ing cause of death among 25-34 year-olds and the
third leading cause of death among 15-25 year-olds
(Kung et al., 2008). The challenge for those who
care for suicide attempters, such as an Emergency
Medicine clinicians, is to assess the likelihood of an-
other attempt, a more lethal one. We believe to fully
asses this risk a tool must be developed that mea-
sures both the biological and cognitive state of the
patient. Such a tool will include Biological Mark-
ers (Bryn): measured by the concentration of cer-
tain biochemical markers, Thought Markers (T n):
measured by artifacts of thought that have been re-
duced to writing or transcribe speech, and Clini-
cal Markers (Cn): measured by traditional clinical
risk factors. In this study we focus on the T n be-
cause of BioNLP’s important role. Here, we employ
machine-learning analysis to examine suicide notes
and how these notes compare to newsgroups. This
is one experiment in a series of experiments that are
intended to provide insight into how best to apply
linguistic tools when responding to suicidal patients.
To gain insight into the suicidal mind, researchers
have suggested empirically analyzing national mor-
tality statistics, psychological autopsies, nonfatal
suicide attempts and documents such as suicide
notes (Shneidman and Farberow, 1957; Maris,
1981). Most suicide notes analysis has focused
on classification and theoretical-conceptual analysis.
Content analysis has been limited to extracting ex-
plicit information from a suicide note, e.g., length of
the message, words, and parts of speech (Ogilvie et
al., 1969). Classification analysis uses data such as
age, sex, marital status, educational level, employ-
ment status and mental disorder (Ho et al., 1998;
Girdhar et al., 2004; Chavez et al., 2006; Demirel
et al., 2007). Only a very few studies have utilized
theoretical-conceptual analysis , despite the asser-
tion in the first formal study of suicide notes (Shnei-
dman and Farberow, 1957) that such an analysis has
much promise. So, the inconclusive nature of the
methods of analysis has limited their application to
patient care.

Our own research has taken a different approach.
In particular we first wanted to determine if mod-
ern machine learning methods could be applied to
free-text from those who committed suicide. Our
first experiment focused on the the ability of ma-
chine learning to distinguish between real suicide
notes and elicited suicide notes as well as mental
health professionals. This is an important question
since all current care is based on a mental health pro-
fession’s interpretation. Our findings showed that
mental health professionals accurately selected gen-
uine suicide notes 50% of the time and the super-
vised machine learning methods were accurate 78%
(Pestian et al., 2008). In this study we shift from
supervised to unsupervised machine learning meth-
ods. Even though these methods have rich history
we know of no research that has applied them to
suicide notes. Our rationale for this study, then, is
that since our ultimate goal is to create a Suicide
Risk Index that incorporates biological and thought
markers it is important to determine if unsupervised
methods can distinguish between suicidal and non-
suicidal writings. To conduct this research we de-
veloped a corpus of over 800 suicide notes from in-
dividuals who had committed suicide, as opposed to
those who attempted or ideated about suicide. This
is an important contribution and, as far as we know,
it is the largest ever developed. It spans 70 years of
notes, and now includes multiple languages. Details
of this corpus are described below. We also created
a corpus of data from various newsgroups that acted
as non-suicidal writings. These corpora were used
to conduct the analysis. The sections below describe
the cluster analysis process and results.

Suicide Notes Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988383692307692">
Data for the suicide note database were collected
from around the United States. They were either
in a hand written or typed written form. Once the
note was acquired it was scanned into the database.
Optical character recognition was attempted on the
typed written notes, but not accurate, so the notes
were read from the scanned version and type into the
database exactly as seen. A second person reviewed
what was typed. There were limitation in collecting
deceased demographics. The table 1 provides vari-
ous descriptive statistics.
Newsgroup Corpus
Newsgroup data was selected because it was conve-
nient and as close to normal discourse as we could
find. We understood that and ideal comparison
group would be composed of Internet blogs or e-
mails that were written by suicide ideators. True,
a Google query of ”suicide blog” yields millions
of response, a review of many of these responses
shows that the data are of little use for this analy-
sis. In our opinion, the next suitable corpora was
found in a 20 newsgroup collection from the Uni-
versity of California in Irvine (UCI) machine learn-
ing repository1. Most of the newsgroups have no
relevance to suicide notes. Since our hypothesis
is that unsupervised learning methods can tell the
difference between suicidal and non-suicidal writ-
ing we selected discussions that we believed may
have some similarity to suicide writings. This se-
lection was based on reviewing the newsgroups
with experts. We had conjectured that if an unsu-
pervised method could distinguish between similar
clusters those methods could distinguish between
dissimilar clusters. The newsgroups ultimately se-
lected were talk.politics.guns, talk.politics.mideast,
talk.politics.misc, talk.religion.misc. Each news-
group contains 1000 articles (newsgroup postings).
Headers and quotes from other postings were re-
moved.

Basic statistics are calculated using variables ex-
tracted by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ver-
sion 2007 software (LIWC2007) (Chung and Pen-
nebaker, 2007). J. W. Pennebaker, C. K. Chung, M.
Ireland, A. Gonzales, and R. J. Booth created an an-
notated dictionary. Each word in the dictionary is
assigned to at least one of the following high level
category: linguistic process, psychological process,
personal concern, or spoken category. These cat-
egories provide an efficient and effective method
for studying the various emotional, cognitive, and
structural components present in individuals’ verbal
and written speech samples (Chung and Pennebaker,
2007; Pennebaker et al., 2001). Here it is used to
analyze differences between suicide notes and news-

group articles.
Feature space was prepared using open source al-
gorithms available in Perl language2. First, Brian
Duggan spell checking software that uses aspell li-
brary was used (Text::SpellChecker module3). Then,
tokenizer created by Aaron Coburn was used (Lin-
gua::EN::Tagger module2) to extract words was ap-
plied. After that, words were filtered with 319 ele-
ment stop word list 4. Next, the Richardson/Franz
English stemmer was included in the pre-processing
stage (Lingua::Stem module2). Features that ap-
peared in less than 10 documents or in more than 500
documents were removed. Documents that had less
than 10 features or more than 500 were removed.
Finally, columns and rows were normalized to have
unitary lengths. These last steps of pre-processing
are used to reduce outliers.
Calculations are done using open source software
called R5. Clustering is done with the following al-
gorithms: expectation maximization (EM) (Witten
and Frank, 2000), simple k-means with euclidean
distance (SKM) (Witten and Frank, 2000), and
sequential information bottleneck algorithm (sIB)
(Slonim et al., 2002). The last approach has been
shown to work well work well when clustering doc-
uments. Specificity, sensitivity and F1 measure are
used as performance measures (Rijsbergen, 1979).
Multidimensional scaling with euclidean distance
measures is used for visualization purposes (Cox
and Cox, 1994).
To extract features that represent each cluster,
Pearson correlation coefficient is used. The correla-
tion coefficient r is calculated between each feature
and each cluster separately r(wi, cj) where wi is ith
word and cj is jth cluster. N best features with the
highest values for each cluster are selected as most
representative.

Table 2 summarizes information about the lin-
guistic and psychological processes of the data.
The idea of ”process” is derived from the Lin-
guistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2007) soft-
ware (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007). This software
conducts traditional natural language processing by
placing various word into categories. For example,
sixltrs includes words that are at least six letters in
length. A full description of this software, dictio-
naries, reliability and validity tests can be found on
LIWC’s website. 6. Table 2 shows that suicide notes
are, in many ways, different than normal text. For
our study this provides inspiration for continued re-
search.

that we use different newsgroups as control groups
same sub-groups of suicide notes are discovered.

Our findings suggest that unsupervised methods can
distinguish between suicide notes and newsgroups,
our proxy for general discussion. This is important
because it is helpful in determining if NLP can be
useful when integrating thought markers with bio-
logical and clinical markers (f(Bm, Tm, Cm)). In
other words, can an NLP tools accurately distin-
guish between suicidal and normal thought markers
(TmS =� TmN)? Moreover these unsupervised meth-
ods have shown an ability to find sub-groups of sui-

The purpose of this paper is to describe one experiment in a series of experiments to develop a that combines Biological Markers Thought Markers and use machine learning to compute a real-time index for assessing the likelihood repeated suicide attempt in the next six-months. For this study we focus using unsupervised machine learning to distinguish between actual suicide notes and newsgroups. This is important because it gives us insight into how well these methods discriminate between real notes and general conversation.</abstract>

J. W. Pennebaker, C. K. Chung, M. Ireland, A. Gonzales, and R. J. Booth created an annotated dictionary. Each word in the dictionary is assigned to at least one of the following high level category: linguistic process, psychological process, personal concern, or spoken category. These categories provide an efficient and effective method for studying the various emotional, cognitive, and structural components present in individuals’ verbal and written speech samples (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007; Pennebaker et al., 2001).

This is important because it gives us insight into how well these methods discriminate between real notes and general conversation. 1 Introduction It is estimated that each year 800,000 die by suicide worldwide (World Health Organization, 2001). In the United States, suicide ranks second as the leading cause of death among 25-34 year-olds and the third leading cause of death among 15-25 year-olds (Kung et al., 2008). The challenge for those who care for suicide attempters, such as an Emergency Medicine clinicians, is to assess the likelihood of another attempt, a more lethal one. We believe to fully asses this risk a tool must be developed that measures both the biological and cognitive state of the patient. Such a tool will include Biological Markers (Bryn): measured by the concentration of certain biochemical markers, Thought Markers (T n): measured by artifacts of thought that have been reduced to writing or transcribe speech, and Clinical Markers (Cn): measured by traditional clinical risk factors.

Our first experiment focused on the the ability of machine learning to distinguish between real suicide notes and elicited suicide notes as well as mental health professionals. This is an important question since all current care is based on a mental health profession’s interpretation. Our findings showed that mental health professionals accurately selected genuine suicide notes 50% of the time and the supervised machine learning methods were accurate 78% (Pestian et al., 2008). In this study we shift from supervised to unsupervised machine learning methods. Even though these methods have rich history we know of no research that has applied them to suicide notes. Our rationale for this study, then, is that since our ultimate goal is to create a Suicide Risk Index that incorporates biological and thought markers it is important to determine if unsupervised methods can distinguish between suicidal and nonsuicidal writings. To conduct this research we developed a corpus of over 800 suicide notes from individuals who had committed suicide, as opposed to those who attemp</context>

Features that appeared in less than 10 documents or in more than 500 documents were removed. Documents that had less than 10 features or more than 500 were removed. Finally, columns and rows were normalized to have unitary lengths. These last steps of pre-processing are used to reduce outliers. Calculations are done using open source software called R5. Clustering is done with the following algorithms: expectation maximization (EM) (Witten and Frank, 2000), simple k-means with euclidean distance (SKM) (Witten and Frank, 2000), and sequential information bottleneck algorithm (sIB) (Slonim et al., 2002). The last approach has been shown to work well work well when clustering documents. Specificity, sensitivity and F1 measure are used as performance measures (Rijsbergen, 1979). Multidimensional scaling with euclidean distance measures is used for visualization purposes (Cox and Cox, 1994). To extract features that represent each cluster, Pearson correlation coefficient is used. The correlation coefficient r is calculated between each feature and e</context>

For this study we focus using unsupervised machine learning to distinguish between actual suicide notes and newsgroups. This is important because it gives us insight into how well these methods discriminate between real notes and general conversation. 1 Introduction It is estimated that each year 800,000 die by suicide worldwide (World Health Organization, 2001). In the United States, suicide ranks second as the leading cause of death among 25-34 year-olds and the third leading cause of death among 15-25 year-olds (Kung et al., 2008). The challenge for those who care for suicide attempters, such as an Emergency Medicine clinicians, is to assess the likelihood of another attempt, a more lethal one. We believe to fully asses this risk a tool must be developed that measures both the biological and cognitive state of the patient. Such a tool will include Biological Markers (Bryn): measured by the concentration of certain biochemical markers, Thought Mark</context>
