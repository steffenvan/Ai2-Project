Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999951764705882">
One of the central assumptions of Opti-
mality Theory is the hypothesis of strict
domination among constraints. A few
studies have suggested that this hypothe-
sis is too strong and should be abandoned
in favor of a weaker cumulativity hy-
pothesis. If this suggestion is correct, we
should be able to find evidence for cumu-
lativity in the comprehension of Gapping
sentences, which lack explicit syntactic
clues in the form of the presence of a fi-
nite verb. On the basis of a comparison
between several computational models of
constraint evaluation, we conclude that
the comprehension of Gapping sentences
does not yield compelling evidence
against the strict domination hypothesis.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966893617022">
A linguistic framework which has gained a con-
siderable amount of attention in recent years is
Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky,
1993/2004). Optimality Theory (henceforth OT)
is not only used for analyzing and explaining
linguistic phenomena in the domain of phonol-
ogy, but also in the domains of morphology, syn-
tax, semantics and pragmatics. In contrast to
more traditional linguistic frameworks, OT as-
sumes grammatical constraints to be violable.
Because constraints are formulated in such a way
that they are maximally general (and perhaps
even universal across languages), these con-
straints may conflict. To resolve conflicts among
constraints, constraints are assumed to differ in
strength. It is better to violate a weaker constraint
than it is to violate a stronger constraint. The
grammatical structure is the one that violates the
least highly ranked (i.e., strong) constraints.
A fundamental property of OT is the principle
of strict domination. This means that each con-
straint has complete priority over all constraints
ranked lower in the constraint hierarchy. A num-
ber of recent studies, however, have called into
question this fundamental property of OT. Keller
(2001) argues that constraint violations must be
cumulative to account for the pattern of relative
acceptability with respect to the phenomenon of
Gapping. Jäger and Rosenbach (to appear) draw
a similar conclusion on the basis of the observed
variation with respect to the English genitive (the
king’s palace versus the palace of the king).
In this study, we focus on the linguistic phe-
nomenon of Gapping. The central question is
whether the comprehension of Gapping sen-
tences provides evidence in favor of cumulativity
of constraint violations. In section 2, we intro-
duce the phenomenon and discuss the possibility
of an OT model of Gapping. In section 3, we
consider different kinds of cumulativity. Section
4 discusses the way we modeled four different
evaluation algorithms based on these kinds of
cumulativity. A comparison between our compu-
tational models of constraint evaluation in sec-
tion 5 suggests that the comprehension of Gap-
ping does not provide compelling evidence for
abandoning the strict domination hypothesis.

The deleted material always includes the finite
verb, but may also include further constituents
such as the direct object. As a result, it may not
always be possible to uniquely identify which
elements were left out. As an example, consider
the following sentence:

2.1 Functional constraints on Gapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998114">
Based on previous work on Gapping, Kuno
(1976) notes that several non-syntactic factors
affect the acceptability and interpretation of Gap-
ping. One of these factors is the distance between
the remnants in the second conjunct and their
counterparts in the first conjunct:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.546402">
(5) The Minimal Distance Principle:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.946303294117647">
The two constituents left behind by Gap-
ping can be most readily coupled with
the constituents (of the same structures)
in the first conjunct that were processed
last of all.
According to this principle, interpretation (3)
should be preferred for sentence (2) because it is
more preferable to couple George in the second
conjunct to the direct object Paul in the first con-
junct, than to the more distant subject John. This
preference is confirmed by experimental evi-
dence (Carlson, 2001). A further principle about
Gapping is that the deleted material has to repre-
sent contextually given information, whereas the
remnants in the second conjunct have to consti-
tute new information. This is captured in the fol-
lowing principle:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990523227272727">
(6) The Functional Sentence Perspective
(FSP) Principle of Gapping:
a. Constituents deleted by Gapping
must be contextually known. On the
other hand, the two constituents left be-
hind by Gapping necessarily represent
new information and, therefore, must be
paired with constituents in the first con-
junct that represent new information.
b. It is generally the case that the
closer a given constituent is to sentence-
final position, the newer the information
it represents in the sentence.
c. Constituents that are clearly
marked for nonanaphoricity necessarily
represent new information in violation of
(b). Similarly, constituents that appear
closest tot sentence-final position neces-
sarily represent old information (in vio-
lation of (b)) if coreferential constituents
appear in the corresponding position in
the preceding discourse.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998793315789474">
This principle explains the observation that in a
suitable context, interpretation (4) can become
the preferred interpretation for (2) (but see Hoeks
et al. (2006) for experimental evidence that in
addition to context also prosody has to be in ac-
cordance with a Gapping reading to make this
reading the preferred reading):
(7) When did John and George greet Paul?
John greeted Paul yesterday and George
greeted Paul today.
In this example, John, Paul and George are all
contextually introduced. But only John and
George are subjects in the context sentence and
hence can be interpreted as contrastive topics in
the target sentence. Contrast has a similar effect
as newness. Because of this effect of context, the
Gapping reading can become the preferred read-
ing for (2). Two further principles proposed by
Kuno are (8) and (9).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.365905">
(8) The Tendency for Subject-Predicate In-
terpretation:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976312">
When Gapping leaves an NP and a VP
behind, the two constituents are readily
interpreted as constituting a sentential
pattern, with the NP representing the
subject of the VP.

(9) The Requirement for Simplex-Sentential
Relationship:
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999435625">
The two constituents left over by Gap-
ping are most readily interpretable as en-
tering into a simplex-sentential relation-
ship. The intelligibility of gapped sen-
tences declines drastically if there is no
such relationship between the two con-
stituents.
The principle in (8) is meant to account for a dif-
ference in preference with object control verbs
versus subject control verbs. The principle in (9)
reflects the observation that Gapping cannot
leave behind remnants that are part of a subordi-
nate clause. Kuno notes that this latter constraint
seems to be the strongest of the four principles,
being nearly inviolable, but does not make the
interaction between his principles explicit.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998468">
2.2 An OT model of Gapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998956">
As Kuno already observes, the FSP Principle
seems to be able to override the Minimal Dis-
tance Principle. This observation is regarded by
Keller (2001) as evidence that Gapping is subject
to constraint competition in an optimality theo-
retic sense. Based on Kuno’s principles, Keller
develops an OT model of Gapping, which is able
to account for the pattern of relative acceptability
of Gapping sentences. According to this model,
the degree of acceptability of a candidate struc-
ture depends on the number and type of re-
rankings required to make the structure optimal
(Keller, 1998).
Keller’s OT model differs from standard OT
in a number of ways. Firstly, a distinction is
made between soft and hard constraints. Hard
constraints cause strong acceptability when vio-
lated, while violation of soft constraints causes
only mild unacceptability. According to Keller,
the Requirement for Simplex-Sentential Rela-
tionship is such a hard constraint. The distinction
between soft and hard constraints is needed in
Keller’s model to avoid the problem of overgen-
eration of acceptability differences.
Secondly, Keller’s model assumes that con-
straint violations are cumulative. According to
his model, the degree of unacceptability in-
creases with the number of constraints violated.
In standard OT, on the other hand, no number of
violations of weaker constraints can override one
violation of a stronger constraint, in accordance
with the principle of strict domination.
The aim of Keller’s OT model is to account
for the pattern of relative acceptability of Gap-
ping sentences. The aim of the present study, on
the other hand, is to account for the comprehen-
sion of Gapping sentences. Nevertheless, we fol-
low Keller in adopting Kuno’s functional princi-
ples (reformulated as OT constraints) for our OT
model because Kuno’s principles are principles
of comprehension.
Our model differs from Keller’s model in sev-
eral essential aspects, though. We assume that all
constraints are violable, in accordance with the
basic assumptions of OT. Because certain strong
constraints are not violated by the data under dis-
cussion, they simply appear to be inviolable.
Keller’s second assumption, the assumption that
constraint violations are cumulative, is the topic
of investigation of this study.

3 Cumulativity of constraint violations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970725">
In this section we discuss the different ways OT
constraints can interact. In principle, OT con-
straints can interact in an unrestricted way, or in
one of several more or less restricted ways.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99933">
3.1 Unrestricted constraint interaction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997376964285714">
OT as a linguistic theory is derived from Har-
monic Grammar (Legendre et al., 1990). In Har-
monic Grammar (henceforth HG), each con-
straint is associated with a positive or negative
numerical weight value. For each candidate, a
so-called Harmony value is calculated by sum-
ming the numerically weighted constraints. From
the set of candidates, the candidate with the
highest Harmony value is selected as the optimal
candidate. Consequently, the interaction among
constraints in HG is cumulative. Each constraint
violation lowers the Harmony value of the can-
didate. This type of constraint interaction is es-
sentially unrestricted.
To account for natural language interpretation,
however, unrestricted cumulativity is too liberal,
as is shown by OT analyses of other phenomena.
With respect to Gapping, if Kuno and Keller are
right, no amount of violations on weaker con-
straints of an interpretation satisfying Simplex-
Sentential Relationship can make an interpreta-
tion violating Simplex-Sentential Relationship
the preferred one:
(10) Who did John promise to examine who?
John promised Paul to examine George,
and Ringo Bob.
If Simplex-Sentential Relationship indeed is a
strong constraint, (10) should only mean that
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999739181818182">
Ringo promised to examine Bob (satisfying Sim-
plex-Sentential Relationship but violating the
Minimal Distance Principle and the FSP), and
never that John promised to examine Bob (vio-
lating Simplex-Sentential Relationship).
For the analysis of natural language, therefore,
but also for the establishment of cross-linguistic
generalizations (see Legendre et al., 2006), we
seem to require a type of constraint interaction
which is more restricted than simple numerical
constraint weighting.

ity is similar to the effects of local conjunction.

Tableau 4: Keller’s counting cumulativity
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946">
Keller’s counting cumulativity is illustrated in
tableau 4. For Keller’s cumulativity, the hierar-
chical relation between the constraints is irrele-
vant. The candidate with the fewest constraint
violations is always optimal. In Keller’s model,
constraint violations are assumed to result in a
gradient pattern. The more constraints are vio-
lated by a given Gapping construction, the less
acceptable the construction is predicted to be. Of
course, this type of cumulativity will greatly
overgenerate in production as well as in compre-
hension if every constraint violation counts as an
equally serious violation. For this reason, a sys-
tem employing this type of cumulativity must
make a distinction between soft and hard con-
straints. Hard constraints cause strong unaccept-
ability. This extra assumption serves to restrict
the overgenerating power of this type of cumula-
tivity.
The four types of cumulativity discussed here
differ in the amount of freedom they allow. Strict
domination is the most restricted type of con-
straint interaction, local restricted cumulativity
the one but most restricted type, global restricted
cumulativity the two but most restricted type,
and Keller’s cumulativity the least restricted
type. As a result, strict domination yields the
strongest hypothesis, and Keller’s cumulativity
the weakest hypothesis. The question we set out
to answer in the next section is how strongly
constraint interaction must be restricted to ac-
count for the comprehension of Gapping sen-
tences.

possible couplings of constituents in the second
conjunct with constituents in the first conjunct.
In addition, for each possible coupling the con-
straint profile is given. For each possible cou-
pling, the model also gives a reconstruction of
the second conjunct by placing the constituents

4.1 Constraint ranking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746285714286">
The constraints implemented in the model were
Kuno’s principles, reformulated as OT con-
straints, augmented with constraints on parallel-
ism (cf. Carlson, 2001), thematic selection
(Hoeks and Hendriks, 2005) and word order
(Lamers and de Hoop, 2004). The constraint
ranking used is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955017833333333">
(11) Categorial Parallelism &gt;&gt; Simplex-
Sentential Relationship &gt;&gt; FSP &gt;&gt; The-

mal Distance &gt;&gt; Subject-Predicate In-
terpretation &gt;&gt; Featural Parallelism
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999296">
The constraint Categorial Parallelism is added to
ensure that constituents are coupled with con-
stituents of the same syntactic category only. It
prevents, for example, that in (2) today is cou-
pled with Paul. Thematic Selection expresses the
selectional restrictions verbs may impose on their
arguments. For example, the verb bake requires
an inanimate object, the verb introduce requires
an animate object, and the verb take can combine
with either an animate or an inanimate object
(see section 4.3). The constraint Thematic Selec-
tion is violated if the candidate interpretation
does not satisfy these selectional restrictions, for
example if the object of the verb bake is animate.
According to the constraint Subject Precedes Ob-
ject, the subject must linearly precede the object.
Syntactic Parallelism requires the two conjuncts
to have the same syntactic structure. The con-
straint Featural Parallelism, finally, promotes the
coupling of constituents which share features
such as animacy, definiteness, number and gen-
der. The ranking of these constraints was deter-
mined on the basis of the literature (Carlson,
2001; Kuno, 1976) and via comparison of rele-
vant sentences and their meanings.

4.2 Computational considerations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980875">
The different types of cumulativity were compu-
tationally modeled as different ways of evaluat-
ing the constraint profiles.
Strict domination can be modeled as numeri-
cal weighting with exponential weights.
Local restricted cumulativity can be modeled
as numerical weighting as well, if the weights are
chosen in such a way that the sum of two adja-
cent constraints is larger than the weight of the
directly dominating constraint. This is the case if,
for example, B is 0.50, C is 0.26, and D is 0.25 in
tableau 2. In our model, local restricted cumula-
tivity only applies to the constraints Thematic
Selection, Subject Precedes Object and Syntactic
Parallelism, and allows the constraints Subject
Precedes Object and Syntactic Parallelism to-
gether to override the directly dominating con-
straint Thematic Selection.
Global restricted cumulativity, on the other
hand, cannot be captured straightforwardly in a
system with weight values. To implement this
evaluation method, therefore, we made explicit
use of constraint conjunction. The newly formed
conjoined constraint C&amp;D was located in the
hierarchy somewhere above its constituting con-
straints C and D. Because violation of this con-
joined constraint is dependent on the violation of
each of the constituting constraints, the new con-
straint can only be evaluated in a second round
of evaluation after all other constraints have been
evaluated. This is an unfortunate complication of
our implementation. Legendre et al. (2006: 352)
show that this type of cumulativity can be im-
plemented with weight values if constraint con-
junction is assumed to involve a superlinear
combination of weights (through summation as
well as multiplication). In our model, only the
constraints Minimal Distance and Subject-
Predicate Interpretation were allowed to conjoin.
The resulting conjoined constraint was located
above Categorial Parallelism in the hierarchy.
For the fourth method of evaluation, Keller’s
counting cumulativity, simply counting the num-
ber of constraint violations suffices. By applying
one of these four evaluation algorithms, the
computational model yields an optimal interpre-
tation for each combination of input and evalua-
tion algorithm.

4.3 Input sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999253732673268">
To test the four evaluation algorithms, we fed the
model three types of input: (i) 10 Gapping sen-
tences taken from a corpus, (ii) test sentences
taken from all five conditions of Carlson’s
(2001) study on Gapping, and (iii) 15 hand-
crafted sentences.
The Eindhoven corpus (uit den Boogaart,
1975) is an annotated corpus of Dutch written
text of about 750 000 words. We scanned the
corpus for suitable Gapping sentences, which
had to occur unembedded, contain an overt con-
junction, and should not involve other deletion
operations as well. Unfortunately, we only found
10 such Gapping sentences in the corpus, pre-
sumably because Gapping is quite rare. For all
ten sentences, all evaluation methods produced
the same outputs. Nine out of the ten optimal
interpretations did not violate any of the con-
straints. One sentence involved a constraint vio-
lation by all models, namely a violation of the
constraint Featural Parallelism:
(12) Groep 1 trok de arm na vijftien minuten
uit de testkamer, en groep 4 na een uur.
Group 1 pulled the arm after fifteen
minutes from the test room and group 4
after an hour.
The most plausible interpretation of this sentence
is the interpretation that group 4 pulled the arm
from the test room after an hour. The interpreta-
tion selected by all evaluation methods, however,
was that group 1 pulled group 4 from the test
room after an hour, thus satisfying Minimal Dis-
tance but violating Featural Parallelism. It may
be that the strong parallelism between group 1
and group 4 sets up a contrast which evokes the
constraint FSP even in the absence of an explicit
linguistic context. If this is true, Minimal Dis-
tance must be violated in order to satisfy FSP.
We also fed the models test sentences taken
from Carlson’s (2001) written questionnaire.
Carlson studied the interaction between The-
matic Selection, Featural Parallelism and Mini-
mal Distance by varying verb type (see the dis-
cussion of Thematic Selection in section 4.1) and
properties of the noun phrases. She distinguished
five conditions: the Bake A condition (Alice
bakes cakes for tourists and Caroline for her
family), the Bake B condition (Alice bakes cakes
for tourists and brownies for her family), the
Take A condition (Josh visited the office during
the vacation and Sarah during the week), the
Take B condition (Josh visited Marjorie during
the vacation and Sarah during the week) and the
Introduce condition (Dan amazed the judges with
his talent and James with his musicality).
The four evaluation algorithms behaved ex-
actly the same on all five conditions of Carlson
because none of Carlson’s sentences involves a
simultaneous violation of Subject Precedes Ob-
ject and Syntactic Parallelism (which would give
rise to local restricted cumulativity in our model)
or a simultaneous violation of Minimal Distance
and Subject-Predicate Interpretation (which
would give rise to global restricted cumulativity
in our model). As a result, all models yielded a
100% Gapping response for Carlson’s Bake A
condition (compared to Carlson’s subjects 81%)
because for all models a violation of Thematic
Selection is more serious than a violation of
Minimal Distance. Furthermore, all models
yielded a 100% non-Gapping response for her
Bake B condition (compared to Carlson’s sub-
jects 97%) because a Gapping response violates
Thematic Selection, Minimal Distance and Fea-
tural Parallelism whereas a non-Gapping re-
sponse satisfies all three constraints. Finally, all
models yielded a 100% non-Gapping response
for Carlson’s Take A condition (compared to
Carlson’s subjects 60%), her Take B condition
(compared to Carlson’s subjects 96%) and her
Introduce condition (compared to Carlson’s sub-
jects 79%) because for all models a violation of
Minimal Distance is more serious than a viola-
tion of Featural Parallelism, given the constraint
ranking in (11).
So all models correctly predicted the interpre-
tational preferences found in Carlson’s experi-
ment. However, subjects’ percentages of non-
Gapping responses on the Take A, Take B and
Introduce condition varied considerably. This
variation seems to be due to differences between
the features of the NPs involved. In particular, in
the Take A condition the feature animacy played
a role, which seems to have a stronger effect than
the other grammatical features that were manipu-
lated. However, our constraint Featural Parallel-
ism does not distinguish between animacy and
other grammatical features. Moreover, our OT
model is unable to capture the gradience that
seems to result from the interaction between fea-
tures.

ers interpret this sentence as meaning that Paul
picked a tulip, then this is evidence for strict

evaluating the constraint FSP. If hearers interpret
this sentence as meaning that John asked George
to bring Ringo, they will have violated the
stronger constraint FSP in order to satisfy the
weaker constraints Minimal Distance and Sub-
ject-Predicate Interpretation. Because FSP does
not immediately dominate the weaker con-
straints, this would be evidence for global re-
stricted cumulativity. To distinguish between
strict domination and Keller’s counting cumula-
tivity, consider the following sentence:
(15) The children promised John to stop, and
the neighbors to continue.
If hearers interpret this sentence as meaning that
the neighbors promised John to continue, they
violate the single stronger constraint Minimal
Distance in favor of satisfaction of the two
weaker constraints Subject-Predicate Interpreta-
tion and Featural Parallelism. Because these con-
straints would all be considered soft constraints
according to Keller’s distinction between hard
and soft constraints, Keller’s counting cumulativ-
ity predicts that this interpretation is preferred.
The strict domination hypothesis, on the other
hand, predicts that the interpretation is preferred
according to which the children promised the
neighbors to continue, since it is more important
to satisfy the stronger constraint Minimal Dis-
tance than any number of weaker constraints.

5 Results and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984334">
For all Gapping sentences occurring in the Eind-
hoven corpus and all Gapping sentences taken
from the written part of Carlson’s psycholinguis-
tic study, the four evaluation algorithms yielded
identical results. These sentences therefore do
not shed any light on the central question of this
study, namely whether the strict domination hy-
pothesis should be abandoned in favor of a
weaker cumulativity hypothesis.
To determine which evaluation algorithm
models the way comprehenders process language
best, we must look at the interpretations of sen-
tences such as (13), (14) and (15). We presented
10 participants with a written questionnaire,
which included 15 sentences distinguishing be-
tween the four evaluation algorithms. The reader
is referred to van der Feen (2005) for the com-
plete list of sentences. The results show that
there does not seem to be a clear preference in
interpretation for sentences such as (13), leaving
the distinction between strict domination and
local restricted cumulativity undecided. For sen-
tences such as (14), on the other hand, there
seems to be a clear preference for the reading
supported by global restricted cumulativity. Sen-
tences such as (15), finally, show no effects at all
of Keller’s counting cumulativity. For only one
sentence only one subject preferred the interpre-
tation according to which the neighbors promised
John to continue, which favors the strict domina-
tion hypothesis and goes against Keller’s cumu-
lativity algorithm. This suggests that constraints
on comprehension may be different from the
principles governing acceptability judgments.
Boersma (2004) argues that the paralinguistic
task of providing acceptability judgments in-
volves comprehension, but under a reverse map-
ping between meaning and form. An alternative
view is that acceptability judgments involve a
mapping from the given form to its optimal
meaning (‘what do I think the sentence means?’),
followed by a mapping from that meaning to the
optimal form for that meaning (‘how would I
express that meaning?’), thus involving princi-
ples of comprehension as well as production.
To conclude, there seems to be a slight indica-
tion of global restricted cumulativity in the com-
prehension of Gapping, but further study with a
larger pool of subjects is required to confirm
these initial findings.

However, a few remarks are in place here.
First, note that for hearers to prefer the interpre-
tation that Paul picked a tulip for (13), the hearer
has to find some motivation in the linguistic con-
text of the utterance for why the speaker chose to
put the object first. In the absence of such a con-
text supporting a non-canonical word order, the
reading that Paul picked a tulip might be dis-
preferred anyway.
Also in sentence (14), context seems to play a
crucial role. Although in general pronouns may
be used to refer to given material, in certain con-
texts pronouns can be emphatically stressed. If
the pronoun in (14) is stressed, it is much easier
to couple George to him to obtain the reading
that John asked George to bring Ringo. This ef-
fect of context and prosody may have been the
main reason for the observed preferences.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
A central principle of Optimality Theory is the
hypothesis of strict domination among con-
straints. In this paper we investigated whether
this hypothesis should be abandoned in favor of
the weaker hypothesis that constraint violations
are cumulative. Studying the effects of four dif-
ferent evaluation algorithms (three of which dis-
play some kind of cumulativity) on the compre-
hension of Gapping sentences, we found a slight
indication of cumulativity effects. However,
these effects are likely to disappear if the context
and prosodic structure of the utterance are taken
into account.

<abstract confidence="0.999857333333333">One of the central assumptions of Optimality Theory is the hypothesis of strict domination among constraints. A few studies have suggested that this hypothesis is too strong and should be abandoned in favor of a weaker cumulativity hypothesis. If this suggestion is correct, we should be able to find evidence for cumulativity in the comprehension of Gapping sentences, which lack explicit syntactic clues in the form of the presence of a finite verb. On the basis of a comparison between several computational models of constraint evaluation, we conclude that the comprehension of Gapping sentences does not yield compelling evidence against the strict domination hypothesis.</abstract>

According to this principle, interpretation (3) should be preferred for sentence (2) because it is more preferable to couple George in the second conjunct to the direct object Paul in the first conjunct, than to the more distant subject John. This preference is confirmed by experimental evidence (Carlson, 2001). A further principle about Gapping is that the deleted material has to represent contextually given information, whereas the remnants in the second conjunct have to constitute new information. This is captured in the following principle: (6) The Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP) Principle of Gapping: a. Constituents deleted by Gapping must be contextually known. On the other hand, the two constituents left behind by Gapping necessarily represent new information and, therefore, must be paired with constituents in the first conjunct that represent new information. b.

In addition, for each possible coupling the constraint profile is given. For each possible coupling, the model also gives a reconstruction of the second conjunct by placing the constituents from the second conjunct in the position of the constituents they are coupled with in the first conjunct. 4.1 Constraint ranking The constraints implemented in the model were Kuno’s principles, reformulated as OT constraints, augmented with constraints on parallelism (cf. Carlson, 2001), thematic selection (Hoeks and Hendriks, 2005) and word order (Lamers and de Hoop, 2004). The constraint ranking used is: (11) Categorial Parallelism &gt;&gt; SimplexSentential Relationship &gt;&gt; FSP &gt;&gt; Thematic Selection &gt;&gt; Subject Precedes Object &gt;&gt; Syntactic Parallelism &gt;&gt; Minimal Distance &gt;&gt; Subject-Predicate Interpretation &gt;&gt; Featural Parallelism The constraint Categorial Parallelism is added to ensure that constituents are coupled with constituents of the same syntactic category only.

According to the constraint Subject Precedes Object, the subject must linearly precede the object. Syntactic Parallelism requires the two conjuncts to have the same syntactic structure. The constraint Featural Parallelism, finally, promotes the coupling of constituents which share features such as animacy, definiteness, number and gender. The ranking of these constraints was determined on the basis of the literature (Carlson, 2001; Kuno, 1976) and via comparison of relevant sentences and their meanings. 4.2 Computational considerations The different types of cumulativity were computationally modeled as different ways of evaluating the constraint profiles. Strict domination can be modeled as numerical weighting with exponential weights. Local restricted cumulativity can be modeled as numerical weighting as well, if the weights are chosen in such a way that the sum of two adjacent constraints is larger than the weight of the directly dominating constraint. This is the case if, for example, B is 0.50, C is 0.26, and D is </context>

Constituents that are clearly marked for nonanaphoricity necessarily represent new information in violation of (b).

This principle explains the observation that in a suitable context, interpretation (4) can become the preferred interpretation for (2) (but see Hoeks et al. (2006) for experimental evidence that in addition to context also prosody has to be in accordance with a Gapping reading to make this reading the preferred reading): (7) When did John and George greet Paul?

Based on Kuno’s principles, Keller develops an OT model of Gapping, which is able to account for the pattern of relative acceptability of Gapping sentences. According to this model, the degree of acceptability of a candidate structure depends on the number and type of rerankings required to make the structure optimal (Keller, 1998). Keller’s OT model differs from standard OT in a number of ways. Firstly, a distinction is made between soft and hard constraints. Hard constraints cause strong acceptability when violated, while violation of soft constraints causes only mild unacceptability. According to Keller, the Requirement for Simplex-Sentential Relationship is such a hard constraint. The distinction between soft and hard constraints is needed in Keller’s model to avoid the problem of overgeneration of acceptability differences.

To resolve conflicts among constraints, constraints are assumed to differ in strength. It is better to violate a weaker constraint than it is to violate a stronger constraint. The grammatical structure is the one that violates the least highly ranked (i.e., strong) constraints. A fundamental property of OT is the principle of strict domination. This means that each constraint has complete priority over all constraints ranked lower in the constraint hierarchy. A number of recent studies, however, have called into question this fundamental property of OT. Keller (2001) argues that constraint violations must be cumulative to account for the pattern of relative acceptability with respect to the phenomenon of Gapping. Jäger and Rosenbach (to appear) draw a similar conclusion on the basis of the observed variation with respect to the English genitive (the king’s palace versus the palace of the king). In this study, we focus on the linguistic phenomenon of Gapping. The central question is whether the comprehension of Gapping sentences provides evidence in favor of cumulativity of constraint violations. In section 2, we introduce the phenomenon and discuss the po</context>

This sentence is ambiguous between reading (3), where first John greeted Paul, and then John greeted George, and reading (4), where first John greeted Paul, and then George greeted Paul. (3) John greeted Paul yesterday and John greeted George today. (4) John greeted Paul yesterday and George greeted Paul today. The reading in (3) is traditionally analyzed as resulting from the operation of conjunction reduction, whereas the reading in (4) is analyzed as resulting from Gapping of the finite verb and the direct object. 2.1 Functional constraints on Gapping Based on previous work on Gapping, Kuno (1976) notes that several non-syntactic factors affect the acceptability and interpretation of Gapping. One of these factors is the distance between the remnants in the second conjunct and their counterparts in the first conjunct: (5) The Minimal Distance Principle: The two constituents left behind by Gapping can be most readily coupled with the constituents (of the same structures) in the first conjunct that were processed last of all. According to this principle, interpretation (3) should be preferred for sentence (2) because it is more preferable to couple George in the second conjunct to the dir</context>

According to the constraint Subject Precedes Object, the subject must linearly precede the object. Syntactic Parallelism requires the two conjuncts to have the same syntactic structure. The constraint Featural Parallelism, finally, promotes the coupling of constituents which share features such as animacy, definiteness, number and gender. The ranking of these constraints was determined on the basis of the literature (Carlson, 2001; Kuno, 1976) and via comparison of relevant sentences and their meanings. 4.2 Computational considerations The different types of cumulativity were computationally modeled as different ways of evaluating the constraint profiles. Strict domination can be modeled as numerical weighting with exponential weights. Local restricted cumulativity can be modeled as numerical weighting as well, if the weights are chosen in such a way that the sum of two adjacent constraints is larger than the weight of the directly dominating constraint. This is the case if, for example, B is 0.50, C is 0.26, and D is 0.25 in table</context>

Because certain strong constraints are not violated by the data under discussion, they simply appear to be inviolable. Keller’s second assumption, the assumption that constraint violations are cumulative, is the topic of investigation of this study. 3 Cumulativity of constraint violations In this section we discuss the different ways OT constraints can interact. In principle, OT constraints can interact in an unrestricted way, or in one of several more or less restricted ways. 3.1 Unrestricted constraint interaction OT as a linguistic theory is derived from Harmonic Grammar (Legendre et al., 1990). In Harmonic Grammar (henceforth HG), each constraint is associated with a positive or negative numerical weight value. For each candidate, a so-called Harmony value is calculated by summing the numerically weighted constraints. From the set of candidates, the candidate with the highest Harmony value is selected as the optimal candidate. Consequently, the interaction among constraints in HG is cumulative. Each constraint violation lowers the Harmony value of the candidate. This type of constraint interaction is essentially unrestricted. To account for natural language interpretation, however,</context>

John promised Paul to examine George, and Ringo Bob. If Simplex-Sentential Relationship indeed is a strong constraint, (10) should only mean that 3 Ringo promised to examine Bob (satisfying Simplex-Sentential Relationship but violating the Minimal Distance Principle and the FSP), and never that John promised to examine Bob (violating Simplex-Sentential Relationship). For the analysis of natural language, therefore, but also for the establishment of cross-linguistic generalizations (see Legendre et al., 2006), we seem to require a type of constraint interaction which is more restricted than simple numerical constraint weighting. 3.2 Restricted constraint interaction In this section we discuss four ways to restrict constraint interaction: (1) strict domination, (2) local restricted cumulativity, (3) global restricted cumulativity, and (4) Keller’s counting cumulativity.

To implement this evaluation method, therefore, we made explicit use of constraint conjunction. The newly formed conjoined constraint C&amp;D was located in the hierarchy somewhere above its constituting constraints C and D. Because violation of this conjoined constraint is dependent on the violation of each of the constituting constraints, the new constraint can only be evaluated in a second round of evaluation after all other constraints have been evaluated. This is an unfortunate complication of our implementation. Legendre et al. (2006: 352) show that this type of cumulativity can be implemented with weight values if constraint conjunction is assumed to involve a superlinear combination of weights (through summation as well as multiplication). In our model, only the constraints Minimal Distance and SubjectPredicate Interpretation were allowed to conjoin. The resulting conjoined constraint was located above Categorial Parallelism in the hierarchy. For the fourth method of evaluation, Keller’s counting cumulativity, simply counting the number of constraint violations suffices. By applying one of these four evaluation algorith</context>
