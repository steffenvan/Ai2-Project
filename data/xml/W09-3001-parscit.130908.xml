<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
Emotion computing is very important for
expressive information extraction. In this
paper, we provide a robust and versatile
emotion annotation scheme based on cog-
nitive emotion theories, which not only
can annotate both explicit and implicit
emotion expressions, but also can encode
different levels of emotion information for
the given emotion content. In addition,
motivated by a cognitive framework, an
automatic emotion annotation system is
developed, and large and comparatively
high-quality emotion corpora are created
for emotion computing, one in Chinese
and the other in English. Such an annota-
tion system can be easily adapted for dif-
ferent kinds of emotion applications and
be extended to other languages.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99997515">
Affective information is important for human
language technology, and sentiment analysis, a
coarse-grained affective computing (Shanahan et
al., 2006), which is attitude assessment, has be-
come the most salient trend. The polarity-driven
approach in sentiment analysis is, however, often
criticized as too general to satisfy some applica-
tions, such as advertisement design and robot
design, and one way to capture more fine-grained
affective information is to detect emotion expres-
sions. Unlike sentiment, emotions are cognitive-
based, which consistently occur across domains
because of its human psychological activities.
We believe that emotion computing, which is a
fine-grained and cognitive-based framework of
affective computing, will provide a more robust
and versatile model for human language technol-
ogy.
Since the concept of emotion is very compli-
cated and subjective, comparing to some annota-
tions such as POS annotation and Chinese word
segmentation annotation, emotion annotation is
highly labor intensive as it requires careful hu-
man judgment. Both explicit and implicit emo-
tions must be recognized and tagged during emo-
tion annotation, therefore, emotion annotation is
not a simple assignment exercise as in POS an-
notation. Technically, emotion annotation can be
divided into two subtasks: emotion detection (i.e.
differentiate emotional content from neutral con-
tent), which is a very important task for affective
information extraction, and emotion classifica-
tion (i.e. assign emotion tags to emotional con-
tent.)
Emotion computing often requires a large and
high-quality annotated data, however, there is a
lack of this kind of corpus. This is not only be-
cause of the enormous human involvement, but
also because of the unavailability of emotion an-
notation scheme, which is robust and versatile
for both emotion annotation and emotion com-
puting. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) is the only work
that explores the issue of emotion detection
while most of the previous studies concentrate on
the emotion classification given a known emo-
tion context (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Kozareva
et al., 2007.) Even for emotion classification,
some issues remain unresolved, such as the com-
plicated relationships among different emotion
types, emotion type selection, and so on. Thus, it
is still far from solving the emotion problem if
emotion annotation is just considered as emo-
tion-tag assignment.
In this paper, we first explore the relationships
among different emotion types with the support
of a proposed emotion taxonomy, which com-
bines some psychological theories and linguistic
semantics. Based on the emotion taxonomy, a
robust and versatile emotion annotation scheme
is designed and used in both Chinese and English

emotion corpora. Our emotion annotation
scheme is very flexible, which is only a layer
added to a sentence, although it can easily be
extended to a higher level of a text. Our annota-
tion scheme not only can provide the emotion
type information, but also can encode the infor-
mation regarding the relationship between emo-
tions. With this versatile annotated emotion in-
formation, different NLP users can extract dif-
ferent emotion information from a given anno-
tated corpus according to their applications.
With such an emotion annotation scheme, a
large and comparatively high-quality annotated
emotion corpus is built for emotion computing
through an unsupervised approach. Tokuhisa et
al. (2008) pointed out that besides emotion cor-
pus, neutral corpus (i.e. sentences containing no
emotion) is also very important for emotion
computing. Therefore, a high-quality neutral
corpus is also automatically collected using con-
textual information. These two corpora are com-
bined to form a complete emotion-driven corpus
for emotion computing. Although the unsuper-
vised method cannot provide a perfectly-
annotated corpus, it can easily adapt for different
emotion computing.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the
previous work on emotion annotation and some
related psychological and linguistic theories. In
Section 3, we describe our emotion taxonomy
and emotion annotation scheme. Section 4 dis-
cusses how the unsupervised corpus is created.
Section 5 presents the pilot experiments for emo-
tion computing with our corpus, which suggests
that the unsupervised approach of our corpus
creation is effective. Finally, a conclusion is
made in Section 5.

There is no clear consensus among many psy-
chological and linguistic theories on the concept
of emotions. Here, we limit our work by the clas-
sic definition of “emotions” (Cannon, 1927):
Emotion is the felt awareness of bodily reactions
to something perceived or thought.
Emotion is a complicated concept, and there
are complicated relationships among different
emotions. For example, the relationship between
“discouraged” and “sad” is different with the one
between “remorse” and “sad.” Hobbs &amp; Gordon
(2008) and Mathieu (2005) explore emotions
mainly from a lexical semantics perspective, and
Schröder et al. (2006) designed an annotation
scheme, EARL, mainly for speech processing.
Because of the disagreements in emotion theories,
EARL did not explore the relationships among
emotion types. In this paper, we focus on emo-
tions in written data, which is very different from
that of in spoken data in terms of expressions.
Here, we first adopt psychological theories
(Plutchik, 1980; Turner, 2000) to create an emo-
tion taxonomy, and then design an emotion anno-
tation scheme based on the taxonomy.
Since most of the previous emotion corpora
are either too small (Xu et al., 2008) or compara-
tively ineffective in terms of accuracy (Tokuhisa
et al., 2008), they cannot satisfy the requirements
of emotion computing. In this paper, based on
Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), a cogni-
tive approach to human emotions (which will be
discussed in the later section), we create an au-
tomatic emotion annotation system. While this
annotation system needs only a little training da-
ta and does not require human supervision, the
corpus still maintains a comparatively high qual-
ity. Another significant advantage of our auto-
matic annotation system is that it can easily adapt
to different emotion applications by simply sup-
plying different training data.
Most of the existing emotion theories study
emotions from the biological and psychological
perspectives, hence they cannot easily apply to
NLP. Fortunately, NSM, one of the prominent
cognitive models exploring human emotions,
offers a comprehensive and practical approach to
emotions (Wierbicka 1996.) NSM describes
complex and abstract concepts, such as emotions,
in terms of simpler and concrete ones. In such a
way, emotions are decomposed as complex
events involving a cause and a mental state,
which can be further described with a set of uni-
versal, irreducible cores called semantic primi-
tives. This approach identifies the exact differ-
ences and connections between emotion concepts
in terms of the causes, which provide an imme-
diate cue for emotion detection and classification.
We believe that the NSM model offers a plausi-
ble framework to be implemented for automatic
emotion computing.

3.1 The emotion taxonomy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947">
Although there are many emotion theories devel-
oped in different fields, such as biology, psy-
chology, and linguistics, most of them agree that
emotion can be divided into primary emotions
and complex emotions (i.e. the combinations of

primary emotions.) There is still controversy
over the selection of primary emotions, nonethe-
less, “happiness”, “sadness”, “anger”, and “fear”
are considered as primary emotions by most of
emotion theories.
Plutchik’s emotion taxonomy (Plutchik 1980),
one of the classic emotion taxonomies, also fol-
lows the division of primary emotions and com-
plex emotions, and Turner&apos;s taxonomy (Turner
2000), which is based on Plutchik’s work, allows
more flexible combinations of primary emotions.
In this paper, we adopt Turner’s taxonomy, with
the two main points emphasized:
1) For each primary emotion, it is divided into
three levels according to its intensity: high, mod-
erate, and low. Besides “happiness,” “sadness,”
“anger” and “fear,” Turner also suggests that
“disgust” and “surprise” can be primary emo-
tions (Turner 1996; Turner 2007). In Chinese,
the character “” (“surprise”) has a strong abil-
ity to form many emotion words, such as
(surprise and happiness), and (surprise and
fear), which is consistent with the explanation of
“surprise” emotion by Plutchik (1991): “when
the stimulus has been evaluated, the surprise may
quickly change to any other emotion.” Therefore,
in our annotation scheme, we consider “happi-
ness,” “sadness,” “anger,” “fear,” and “surprise”
as primary emotions.
2) Complex emotion can be divided into first-
order complex emotions (consisting of two pri-
mary emotions), second-order complex emotions
(consisting of three primary emotions), and so on,
according to the number of primary emotions
that involves in the complex emotion. For exam-
ple, “pride” (happiness + fear) is a first-order
complex emotion, which contains a greater
amount of “happiness” with a lesser amount of
“fear.”
Tables 1 and 2 show some keywords in Turn-
er’s taxonomy, and the symbol “//” is to separate
different emotion types. Table 1 lists the five
most common English keywords and their cor-
responding primary emotions, and Table 2 lists
the English keywords and their corresponding
complex emotions. In Table 2, several emotion
keywords, which express similar emotion
meaning, are grouped into an emotion type. For
example, the emotion keywords “awe, reverence,
veneration” are grouped into emotion type
“awe.” For a complex emotion, the order of pri-
mary emotions indicates the importance of those
primary emotions for that complex emotion. For
examples, “envy” is “fear + anger,” which con-
tains a greater amount of “fear” with a lesser
amount of “anger” whereas “awe” is “fear +
happiness,” which contains a greater amount of
“fear” with a lesser amount of “happiness.”
For English emotion keywords, as Turner’s
taxonomy missed some common emotion key-
words, we add the emotion keywords from
Plutchik&apos;s taxonomy. Besides, unlike Chinese,
English words have morphological variations, for
example, the emotion keyword “pride” can occur
in text with the various formats: “pride,”
“prides,” “prided,” “proud,” “proudly.” As
shown in Tables 1 and 2, there are 188 English
lemmas in our taxonomy. In total, there are 720
emotion keywords if morphology is taken into
account.
Since Turner’s emotion taxonomy is cogni-
tive-based, it is versatile for different languages
although there is no one-to-one mapping. We
also explore Chinese emotion taxonomy in our
previous work (Chen at el., 2009). We first select
emotion keywords from the cognitive-based feel-
ing words listed in Xu and Tao (2003), and then
map those emotion keywords to Turner’s taxon-
omy with adaptation for some cases. Lastly,
some polysemous emotion keywords are re-
moved to reduce ambiguity, and 226 Chinese
emotion keywords remain.
Moreover, Turner’s taxonomy is a compara-
tively flexible structure, and more extensions can
be done for different applications. For example,
for a complex emotion, not only its primary emo-
tions are listed, but also the intensity of the pri-
mary emotions can be given. For instance, three
emotion types, which belong to “anger + fear,”
are extended as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.822696">
Jealousy: Anger (Moderate) + Fear (Moderate)
Suspicion: Anger (Low) + Fear (Low)
Abhorrence: Anger (High) + Fear (Low)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857">
Finally, we should admit that the emotion tax-
onomy is still an on-going research topic and
needs further exploration, such as the position of
a given emotion keyword in the emotion taxon-
omy, whether and how to group similar emotion
keywords, and how to decompose a complex
emotion into primary emotions.

&lt;primaryEmtion&gt; element
It describes the property of a primary emotion
involved in the emotion type. There are three
attributes: “order,” “name,” and “intensity.”
“Order” gives the weight of this primary emo-
tion in the emotion type, and the weight value
decreases with the ascending “order” value.
“Name” and “intensity” provide the name and
intensity of a primary emotion. To encode the
information in our emotion taxonomy, the value
of “order” is {1,2,3,4,5}, the value of “name” is
{“happiness,” “sadness,” “anger,” “fear”, “sur-
prise” }, and the value of “intensity” is {“high”,
“moderate”, “low”.}
The &lt;primaryEmotion&gt; element seems to be
redundant because its encoded information can
be obtained from the given emotion taxonomy if
the name of the emotion type is available, but
the presence of this element can make our anno-
tation scheme more robust. Sometimes emotion
is so complicated (especially for those emotion
expressions without any explicit emotion key-
word) that an annotator may not be able to find
an exact emotion type to match this emotion, or
to list all involved primary emotions. For those
subtle cases, emotion annotation can be simpli-
fied to list the involved primary emotions as
many as possible through &lt;primaryEmotion&gt;
elements. For example, in Sentence 3 in Figure 2,
although there is no emotion keyword occurring,
the word “hurt” indicates the presence of an
emotion, which at least involves “sadness.”
However, because it is hard to explicitly list oth-
er primary emotions, therefore, we give only the
annotation of “sadness.”
Our annotation scheme has the versatility to
provide emotion data for different applications.
For example, if textual information input anno-
tated with our scheme is provided for the Japa-
nese robot Saya (Hashimoto et al, 2006) to con-
trol her facial emotion expression, a simple
mapping from our 24 emotion types can be done
automatically to Saya’s six emotion types, i.e.
surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and
sadness. As four of her emotion types are also
unique primary emotions, using information en-
coded in &lt;emotionType&gt; element and &lt;pri-
maryEmotion&gt; element will ensure unique
many-to-one mapping and the correct robotic
expressions. A trickier case involves her “anger”
and “disgust’ emotions. The emotion type “an-
ger” in our taxonomy includes emotion words
“anger” and “disgust”. However, with the “key-
word” information provided in &lt;emotionType&gt;
element, a small subset of “anger” emotion in
our taxonomy can be mapped to “disgust” in
Saya’s system. For example, we could map
keywords “dislike, disgust, hate” to “disgust”,

and all the remaining ones, such as “outrage,

4 Emotion-driven corpus creation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980097560975">
Similar to most corpora, our corpus creation is
designed to satisfy the requirements of real emo-
tion computing. Emotions can be expressed with
or without emotion vocabulary in the text. It
seems to be intuitive that emotion computing for
a context with emotion keywords can be satis-
factory when the collection of emotion vocabu-
lary is comprehensive, such as “joyful” indicates
the presence of “happiness” emotion. However,
this intuitive approach cannot work well because
of the ambiguity of some emotion keywords and
the emotion context shift as the sentiment shift
(Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004). Moreover, the de-
tection of emotions in a context without emotion
keywords is very challenging. To deal with these
problems, we build the emotion corpus, which is
motivated by the NSM theory.
According to the NSM theory, an emotion is
provoked by a stimulus. This indicates one pos-
sible way to detect emotions in text, i.e. the de-
tection of emotional stimulus, which is often
provided in the text. In other words, emotion
corpus is a collection of emotion stimuli. Since
emotion is subjective, the stimulus-based ap-
proach works only when its context is provided.
For example, the stimulus – “build a gym for
this community” – may cause different emotions,
such as “surprise”, “happy” and so on, depend-
ing on its context. We also notice that the text
containing an emotion keyword may contain
emotional stimulus and its context. Thus, a natu-
ral corpus creation approach comes out.
In our system, a pattern-based approach is
used to collect the emotion corpus, which is sim-
ilar to the one used in Tokuhisa et al. (2008), but
we do not limit to event-driven emotions
(Kozareva et al., 2008), and adjust our rules to
improve the quality of emotion annotation.
There are five steps in our emotion sentence an-
notation as given below, and Steps (2) and (3)
are to improve the annotation quality.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.942953625">
1) Extract emotion sentences: sentences con-
taining emotion keywords are extracted by
keyword matching.
2) Delete ambiguous structures: some ambigu-
ous sentences, which contain structures such
as negation and modal, are filtered out.
3) Delete ambiguous emotion keywords: if an
emotion keyword is very ambiguous, all sen-

<bodyText confidence="0.998446588235294">
tences containing this ambiguous emotion
keyword are filtered out.
4) Give emotion tags: each remaining sentence
is marked with its emotion tag according to the
emotion type which the focus emotion word
belongs to (refer to Tables 1 and 2.)
5) Ignore the focus emotion keywords: for
emotion computing, the emotion word is re-
moved from each sentence.
Polanyi and Zaenen (2004) addressed the is-
sue of polarity-based sentiment context shift,
and the similar phenomenon also exists in emo-
tion expressions. In our corpus creation, two
kinds of contextual structures are handled with:
the negation structure and the modal structure.
In both English and Chinese, a negated emotion
expression can be interpreted as one of the three
possible meanings (as shown in Figure 3): oppo-
site to the target emotion (S1), deny the exis-
tence of the target emotion (S2), or confirm the
existence of the target emotion (S3). The modal
structure often indicates that the emotion expres-
sion is based on the counter-factual assumption,
hence the emotion does not exist at all (S4 and
S5 in Figure 3). Although Chinese and English
have different interpretations about the modal
structure, for emotion analysis, those sentences
often do not express an emotion. Therefore, to
ensure the quality of the emotion corpus, all sen-
tences containing a negation structure or a modal
structure, which are detected by some rules plus
a list of keywords (negation polarity words for
the negation structure, and modal words for the
modal structure), are removed.

emotion keywords, after Step (2), for each emo-
tion keyword, five sentences are randomly se-
lected and annotated by two annotators. If the
accuracy of five sentences is lower than 40%,
this emotion keyword is removed from our emo-
tion taxonomy. Finally, 191 Chinese keywords
and 645 English keywords are remained.
Tokuhisa et al. found that a big challenge for
emotion computing, especially for emotion de-
tection, is to collect neutral sentences. Since
neutral sentences are unmarked and hard to de-
tect, we develop a naïve yet effective algorithm

to create a neutral corpus. A sentence is consid-
ered as neutral only when the sentence itself and
its context (i.e. the previous sentence and the
following sentence) do not contain any of the
given emotion keywords.
We run our emotion sentence extraction and
neutral sentence extraction on three corpora: the
Sinica Corpus (Chinese), the Chinese Gigaword
Corpus, and the British National Corpus (BNC,
English), and create three emotion corpora and
three neutral corpora separately. The Sinica
Corpus is a balanced Chinese corpus, which in-
cludes documents in 15 kinds of genres; The
Chinese Gigaword Corpus is a huge collection
of news reports; The BNC is also a balanced
corpus, which collects documents from different
domains.
To estimate the accuracy of our emotion sen-
tence extraction, we randomly select about 1000
sentences from the three emotion corpora, and
have two annotators to check it. Table 3 lists the
accuracy of those emotions sentences (emotion
corpus.) To test how good this straightforward
neutral sentence extraction strategy is, about
1000 sentences are randomly selected from each
of the three neutral corpora and are checked by
two annotators. Table 3 lists the accuracy of
those neutral sentences (neutral corpus.)

From Table 3, the high accuracy of neutral
corpus proves that our approach is effective in
extracting neutral sentences from the document-
based corpus which contains contextual informa-
tion. Although the accuracy of emotion corpus is
lower, it is still much higher than the one re-
ported by Kozareva et al. (2008), i.e. 49.4. The
accuracy is significantly increased by deleting
ambiguous emotion keywords in Step (3). For
the 2,474 randomly selected Chinese sentences,
the overall accuracy of the remaining 1,751 sen-
tence is increased by about 14% after Step (3).
For the 803 randomly selected English sentences,
the accuracy of the remaining 473 sentence is
increased about 21% after Step (3). Whether or
how the ambiguous emotion keywords in Step 3
are removed is a tradeoff between the coverage
and the accuracy of the emotion corpus.
From Table 3, we also find that the accuracy
of English emotion corpus is much lower than
Chinese emotion corpus, which indicates Eng-
lish emotion sentences expressed by emotion
keywords are more ambiguous than that of Chi-
nese. Moreover, during our emotion corpus
building, 20.2% of Sinica sentences and 22.4%
of Gigaword sentences are removed in Step (2)
and (3), on the contrary, 41.2% of BNC sen-
tences are deleted. Although it is more difficult
to develop the rules in Step (2) and (3) for Chi-
nese than for English, it also confirms the higher
ambiguity of emotion expressions in English due
to the ambiguity of emotion keyword. Finally,
because of the comparatively-high percentage of
the sentences removed in Step (2) and (3), more
exploration about those sentences is needed,
such as the emotion distribution, the expression
patterns and so on, and how to re-incorporate
them into the emotion corpus without hurting the
whole quality is also our future work.
We also explore emotions through the sen-
tences (no-emotion-keyword sentences) that do
not contain any given emotion keyword, because
our approach extracts only partial neutral sen-
tences and partial emotion sentences in reality.
For each corpus, about 1000 no-emotion-
keyword sentences are randomly selected and
checked by two annotators. It is surprising that
only about 1% of those sentences express emo-
tions. This indicates that it is important for real
emotion computing, which mainly works on
formal written text, to deal with the emotion ex-
pressions which contain emotion keywords and
however are ambiguous, such as the sentences
deleted in Steps (2) and (3). More exploration is
needed for the emotion and neutral sentence dis-
tribution on other kinds of written text, such as
blogs, and on spoken text.
The unsupervised corpus creation approach
can easily be adapted for different languages and
different emotion applications, provided that the
keyword collection and patterns in Step (2) and
(3) need some changes. Moreover, another big
advantage of our approach is that it can avoid
the controversy during emotion annotation.
Emotion is subjective, and therefore disagree-
ment for emotion types often arises if the emo-
tion is not expressed through an explicit emotion
keyword.
Overall, the annotated corpus created by the
unsupervised approach has a comparatively high
quality, and is suitable for the emotion comput-
ing. As the size of the neutral corpus is much
bigger than its corresponding emotion corpus, to
avoid model bias, we randomly select some neu-
tral sentences from the neutral corpus, combin-

In this paper, we present some pilot work to
prove that our emotion-driven corpus is useful
for emotion computing. With the inclusion of
neutral sentences, emotion detection and classi-
fication is simplified into a general classification
problem, and a supervised machine learning
method can be directly applied if enough anno-
tated data are obtained. Here, we choose the
MaxEnt learning in Mallet as a classifier.
Both the Sinica Corpus and the Chinese Cri-
gaword Corpus are segmented, and POS-tagged.
This allows us to implement the bag-of-words
approach in the focus sentences in both Chinese
and English. However, emotions are mostly hu-
man attitudes or expectations arising from situa-
tions, where situations are often expressed in
more than a single word. Such kind of situations
tends to be more easily extracted by word bi-
grams (2-gram word) than by word unigram (1-
gram word.) To take this into account, besides 1-
gram words, we also extract word bi-grams from
the focus sentences.
There are too many emotion types in our cor-
pus, which can cause data sparse; therefore, we
choose the most frequent emotions to do explo-
ration. Besides the five primary emotions, for
Chinese, we select another nine complex emo-
tions, and for English, we select another four
complex emotions. Other emotion types are re-
named as “Other Emotions.”
Since Chinese emotion-driven corpus is much
larger than the English one, to fairly compare the
performance, we reduce the size of Chinese cor-
pus in our experiments. Then, for each corpus,
we reserve 80% as the training data, 10% as the
development data, and 10% as the test data
(there are two sets of test data as follows.) In the
evaluation, for each emotion sentence, if our
system detects one of its emotion tags, we con-
sider this sentence is correctly tagged.
Test data set 1 (TDS 1): contains about 10%
of the sentences from the complete emotion-
driven corpus, and emotion tags are automati-
cally given during the corpus creation.
Test data set 2 (TDS 2): contains the sen-
tences used in Table 3, which is checked by two
annotators. If more than one emotion tags co-
exist in a sentence, all of them are chosen to la-
bel the sentence. If there exists an emotion that
does not belong to any of the emotion types, it is
labeled as “Other Emotions.”
Table 4 shows the performance (accuracy) of
our system for Test data set 1 and 2 for both
Chinese and English. We notice that our corpus
creation approach is effective for emotion com-
puting. As we expect, the 2-gram words can par-
tially catch the emotion stimulus, and improves
the performances. However, the overall per-
formance is still very low, which indicates that
emotion computing is a difficult task. From the
error analysis, it is surprised that for Chinese,
the mislabeling of emotion sentences as neutral
sentences (“emotion” vs. “neutral”) is a common
error, and whereas, for English, two kinds of
errors: “emotion” vs. “neutral” and “focus emo-
tions” vs. “Other emotions” (the mislabeling of a
sentence with a focus emotion as “Other emo-
tions,”) occupy at least 50%. The error distribu-
tion confirms the importance of emotion detec-
tion during emotion computing. The high fre-
quency of the error of “focus emotions” vs.
“Other Emotions” in English may be because
there are fewer focus emotion types for English.

<bodyText confidence="0.999923652173913">
Emotion, no matter its annotation or computing,
is still a new and difficult topic. In this paper, we
apply emotion theories to design a cognitive-
based emotion annotation scheme, which are
robust and versatile so that it can encode differ-
ent levels of emotion information for different
emotion computing. Moreover, motivated from
NSM, we develop an unsupervised approach to
create a large and comparatively high-quality
corpus for emotion computing, which is proven
in our pilot experiments to be useful. Moreover,
this approach makes emotion computing for dif-
ferent applications possible through a little mod-
ification.
Certainly, there are some issues remaining un-
solved. For corpus construction, we will explore
emotion distribution in other kinds of corpora,
such as blog and dialog, and make analysis of
ambiguous emotion sentences, such as negation
structure and modal structure. For emotion com-
puting, we did only pilot experiments and more
work needs to be done, such as feature extrac-
tion.

In this paper, we provide a robust and versatile emotion annotation scheme based on cognitive emotion theories, which not only can annotate both explicit and implicit emotion expressions, but also can encode different levels of emotion information for the given emotion content. In addition, motivated by a cognitive framework, an automatic emotion annotation system is developed, and large and comparatively high-quality emotion corpora are created for emotion computing, one in Chinese and the other in English.

For example, in Sentence 3 in Figure 2, although there is no emotion keyword occurring, the word “hurt” indicates the presence of an emotion, which at least involves “sadness.” However, because it is hard to explicitly list other primary emotions, therefore, we give only the annotation of “sadness.” Our annotation scheme has the versatility to provide emotion data for different applications. For example, if textual information input annotated with our scheme is provided for the Japanese robot Saya (Hashimoto et al, 2006) to control her facial emotion expression, a simple mapping from our 24 emotion types can be done automatically to Saya’s six emotion types, i.e. surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness. As four of her emotion types are also unique primary emotions, using information encoded in &lt;emotionType&gt; element and &lt;primaryEmotion&gt; element will ensure unique many-to-one mapping and the correct robotic expressions. A trickier case involves her “anger” and “disgust’ emotions. The emotion type “anger” in our taxonomy includes emotion words “anger” and “disgust”. However, with the “keyword” inf</context>

Emotion computing often requires a large and high-quality annotated data, however, there is a lack of this kind of corpus. This is not only because of the enormous human involvement, but also because of the unavailability of emotion annotation scheme, which is robust and versatile for both emotion annotation and emotion computing. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) is the only work that explores the issue of emotion detection while most of the previous studies concentrate on the emotion classification given a known emotion context (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Kozareva et al., 2007.) Even for emotion classification, some issues remain unresolved, such as the complicated relationships among different emotion types, emotion type selection, and so on. Thus, it is still far from solving the emotion problem if emotion annotation is just considered as emotion-tag assignment.

In this paper, we adopt Turner’s taxonomy, with the two main points emphasized: 1) For each primary emotion, it is divided into three levels according to its intensity: high, moderate, and low. Besides “happiness,” “sadness,” “anger” and “fear,” Turner also suggests that “disgust” and “surprise” can be primary emotions (Turner 1996; Turner 2007). In Chinese, the character “” (“surprise”) has a strong ability to form many emotion words, such as (surprise and happiness), and (surprise and fear), which is consistent with the explanation of “surprise” emotion by Plutchik (1991): “when the stimulus has been evaluated, the surprise may quickly change to any other emotion.” Therefore, in our annotation scheme, we consider “happiness,” “sadness,” “anger,” “fear,” and “surprise” as primary emotions. 2) Complex emotion can be divided into firstorder complex emotions (consisting of two primary emotions), second-order complex emotions (consisting of three primary emotions), and so on, according to the number of primary emotions that involves in the complex emotion. For example, “pride” (happiness + fear) is a first-order complex emotion, which contains a greater amount of “</context>

Here, we limit our work by the classic definition of “emotions” (Cannon, 1927): Emotion is the felt awareness of bodily reactions to something perceived or thought. Emotion is a complicated concept, and there are complicated relationships among different emotions. For example, the relationship between “discouraged” and “sad” is different with the one between “remorse” and “sad.” Hobbs &amp; Gordon (2008) and Mathieu (2005) explore emotions mainly from a lexical semantics perspective, and Schröder et al.

In addition, motivated by a cognitive framework, an automatic emotion annotation system is developed, and large and comparatively high-quality emotion corpora are created for emotion computing, one in Chinese and the other in English. Such an annotation system can be easily adapted for different kinds of emotion applications and be extended to other languages. 1 Introduction Affective information is important for human language technology, and sentiment analysis, a coarse-grained affective computing (Shanahan et al., 2006), which is attitude assessment, has become the most salient trend. The polarity-driven approach in sentiment analysis is, however, often criticized as too general to satisfy some applications, such as advertisement design and robot design, and one way to capture more fine-grained affective information is to detect emotion expressions. Unlike sentiment, emotions are cognitivebased, which consistently occur across domains because of its human psychological activities. We believe that emotion computing, which is a fine-grained and cognitive-based framework of affective computing, will provide a m</context>

<context position="2853" citStr="Tokuhisa et al.

Emotion computing often requires a large and high-quality annotated data, however, there is a lack of this kind of corpus. This is not only because of the enormous human involvement, but also because of the unavailability of emotion annotation scheme, which is robust and versatile for both emotion annotation and emotion computing. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) is the only work that explores the issue of emotion detection while most of the previous studies concentrate on the emotion classification given a known emotion context (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Kozareva et al., 2007.) Even for emotion classification, some issues remain unresolved, such as the complicated relationships among different emotion types, emotion type selection, and so on. Thus, it is still far from solving the emotion problem if emotion annotation is just considered as emotion-tag assignment. In this paper, we first explore the relationships among different emotion types with the s</context>

(2008)" startWordPosition="677" endWordPosition="680">is only a layer added to a sentence, although it can easily be extended to a higher level of a text. Our annotation scheme not only can provide the emotion type information, but also can encode the information regarding the relationship between emotions. With this versatile annotated emotion information, different NLP users can extract different emotion information from a given annotated corpus according to their applications. With such an emotion annotation scheme, a large and comparatively high-quality annotated emotion corpus is built for emotion computing through an unsupervised approach. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) pointed out that besides emotion corpus, neutral corpus (i.e. sentences containing no emotion) is also very important for emotion computing. Therefore, a high-quality neutral corpus is also automatically collected using contextual information. These two corpora are combined to form a complete emotion-driven corpus for emotion computing. Although the unsupervised method cannot provide a perfectlyannotated corpus, it can easily adapt for different emotion computing. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the previous work on emotion annotation </context>

In this paper, based on Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), a cognitive approach to human emotions (which will be discussed in the later section), we create an automatic emotion annotation system. While this annotation system needs only a little training data and does not require human supervision, the corpus still maintains a comparatively high quality. Another significant advantage of our automatic annotation system is that it can easily adapt to different emotion applications by simply supplying different training data. Most of t</context>

Since emotion is subjective, the stimulus-based approach works only when its context is provided. For example, the stimulus – “build a gym for this community” – may cause different emotions, such as “surprise”, “happy” and so on, depending on its context. We also notice that the text containing an emotion keyword may contain emotional stimulus and its context. Thus, a natural corpus creation approach comes out. In our system, a pattern-based approach is used to collect the emotion corpus, which is similar to the one used in Tokuhisa et al. (2008), but we do not limit to event-driven emotions (Kozareva et al., 2008), and adjust our rules to improve the quality of emotion annotation. There are five steps in our emotion sentence annotation as given below, and Steps (2) and (3) are to improve the annotation quality. 1) Extract emotion sentences: sentences containing emotion keywords are extracted by keyword matching. 2) Delete ambiguous structures: some ambiguous sentences, which contain structures such as negation and modal, are filtered out. 3) Delete ambiguous emotion keywords: if an emotion keyword is very ambiguous, all sentences con</context>

In total, there are 720 emotion keywords if morphology is taken into account. Since Turner’s emotion taxonomy is cognitive-based, it is versatile for different languages although there is no one-to-one mapping. We also explore Chinese emotion taxonomy in our previous work (Chen at el., 2009). We first select emotion keywords from the cognitive-based feeling words listed in Xu and Tao (2003), and then map those emotion keywords to Turner’s taxonomy with adaptation for some cases. Lastly, some polysemous emotion keywords are removed to reduce ambiguity, and 226 Chinese emotion keywords remain. Moreover, Turner’s taxonomy is a comparatively flexible structure, and more extensions can be done for different applications. For example, for a complex emotion, not only its primary emotions are listed, but also the intensity of the primary emotions can be given. For instance, three emotion types, which belong to “anger + fear,” are extended as follows: Jealousy: Anger (Moderate) + Fear (M</context>
