This paper proposes a practical integrated en-
vironment for extracting rules for the anaphora
resolution of zero pronouns from monolingual
and/or bilingual corpora. This method takes
into account the practical situation for making
resolution rules of zero pronouns in specific do-
main texts; the types of usable corpora (mono-
lingual and/or bilingual) for examining the ex-
traction of resolution rules have been changed
depending on the type of NLP system using
extracted resolution rules. The extraction pro-
cesses of resolution rules in the environment are
classified into five component tasks: (1) Zero
Pronoun Identification, (2) Antecedent Anno-
tation, (3) Rejection of Sentences Unsuitable
for Rule Extraction, (4) Rule Extraction, and
(5) Extracted Rule Application and Modifica-
tion. An automatic process and/or a manual
process with a user friendly human interface can
be used to achieve each component task. This
environment was implemented in the Japanese-
to-English machine translation system, ALT-
J/E, for Japanese zero pronoun resolution.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970896125">
In natural languages, elements that can be eas-
ily deduced by a reader are frequently omit-
ted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978).
This phenomenon causes considerable problems
in NLP systems such as MT, text summariza-
tion and text retrieval. In particular, the sub-
ject and object are often omitted in Japanese,
whereas they are normally obligatory in En-
glish&apos;. In Japanese-to-English machine transla-
tion systems, therefore, it is necessary to iden-
tify case elements omitted from the original
Japanese (&amp;quot;zero pronouns&amp;quot;) for their accurate
translation into English expressions.
Several algorithms have been proposed with
regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986;
Yoshimoto, 1988; Walker et al., 1990; Dohsaka,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.989307">
1-For example, there are 93 omitted case elements in
102 sentences in 30 newspaper articles which have to be
explicitly translated into English.

<bodyText confidence="0.99972935483871">
1994). However, it is not possible to apply these
methods directly to a practical machine trans-
lation system because of their low precision of
resolution and the large volume of knowledge
required.
To overcome these kinds of problems, sev-
eral methods have been proposed (Nakaiwa
and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995;
Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996). The focus of
these methods is on applications for a practical
machine translation system with an unlimited
translation target area.
With these methods, however, it is necessary
to make resolution rules for zero pronouns by
hand. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time
and effort for the experts of the NLP system
to make these rules robust and with wide cov-
erage. Furthermore, resolution rules often have
to be made depending on the target domain of
the documents, and this also requires the time-
consuming labor of experts. Because of these
problems, there is a need for an effective and
efficient method of making resolution rules for
zero pronouns.
Typical methods for this purpose include ex-
tracting resolution rules for zero pronouns from
monolingual corpora (Nasukawa, 1996; Mu-
rata and Nagao, 1997), from bilingual corpora
(Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b), and from
monolingual corpora with tags for antecedents
of zero pronouns (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ya-
mamoto and Sumita, 1998).
Monolingual corpora are relatively easy to
collect. Methods using monolingual corpora,
however, have difficulties in extracting resolu-
tion rules of zero pronouns whose referents are
normally unexpressed in Japanese.
Methods using sentence-aligned bilingual cor-
pora are better than those using monolingual
corpora. This is particularly so with a bilingual
corpus of dissimilar languages such as Japanese
and English whose language families are so dif-
ferent and where the distributions of zero pro-
nouns are also quite different. However, bilin-
gual corpora are relatively difficult to collect,
especially sentence-aligned corpora.
With methods using monolingual corpora
with antecedent tags, it is possible to efficiently
make effective resolution rules by relying on
the annotated information. However, there are
only a few corpora with antecedent tags for zero
pronouns. The standardization for annotating
zero pronouns and their antecedents is still on-
going (Hasida, 2000). Consequently, in actual
situations, analysts who want to make resolu-
tion rules for zero pronouns also have to labo-
riously annotate antecedent tags to zero pro-
nouns in the corpus by hand, as previously men-
tioned. Therefore, an annotation tool for the
antecedents of zero pronouns in the texts (Aone
and Bennett, 1994) is needed for the effective
addition of tags to zero pronouns.
To create resolution rules of zero pronouns
in a text of a specific domain, we commonly
use only monolingual corpora in the specific do-
main without antecedent tags for zero pronouns.
Accordingly, analysts annotate tags to the an-
tecedents of every zero pronoun in the corpus
to make effective resolution rules. However, to
accomplish this in machine translation, it is also
possible to use bilingual corpora in the specific
domain, such as a former version of a text that
has already been translated or bilingual corpora
used for translation memory systems. In this
case, methods that automatically extract the
resolution rules of zero pronouns from bilingual
corpora (Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b) can
be used. An automatic extraction process, how-
ever, cannot make perfect rule sets. Therefore,
the automatically extracted rules have to be
confirmed by human interaction before adding
the rule set used in anaphora resolution in NLP
systems if highly reliable rules such as domain-
independent default rules are required. Further-
more, the human interaction must take into ac-
count the efficiency of acquiring resolution rules
from both monolingual and bilingual corpora.
Considering these practical conditions for ex-
tracting the resolution rules of zero pronouns,
this paper proposes a practical integrated tool
capable of extracting rules for the anaphora
resolution of zero pronouns from monolingual
and/or bilingual corpora.

2 Component Tasks of Resolution

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.687982">
Rule Extraction of Zero Pronouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999607714285714">
We classify the subtasks for extracting resolu-
tion rules from corpora into the following five
component tasks: (1) Zero Pronoun Identifica-
tion, (2) Antecedent Annotation, (3) Rejection
of Sentences for Rule Extraction, (4) Rule Ex-
traction, and (5) Extracted Rule Application
and Modification.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970955">
2.1 Zero Pronoun Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933666666667">
The zero pronoun identification process identi-
fies zero pronouns that must be resolved in an
NLP system using extracted resolution rules.
For example, Japanese, which is a free word-
order language, often has no explicit cue helpful
in determining obligatory case elements. There-
fore, in this language, the identification of zero
pronouns in the corpus is also important for ex-
tracting resolution rules. Furthermore, depend-
ing on the NLP system, the zero pronouns that
must be resolved are different. For example,
MT systems only need to resolve zero pronouns
that must be explicitly translated into the tar-
get. In a Japanese sentence (1), the subject (ga-
case) is not expressed in Japanese but becomes
optional when translated into English, because
it is possible to translate this by using the ex-
pression, &amp;quot;Zoos raise lions.&amp;quot;.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963333333333">
Therefore, in the zero pronoun identification
process, the analysis results of the NLP system
must be taken into account.
Zero pronoun identification in monolingual
corpora only relies on the analysis results of the
NLP system. In bilingual corpora, however, the
translation equivalent of zero pronouns is also
usable as a trigger for determining zero pro-
nouns that must be resolved.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999364">
2.2 Antecedent Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998932">
The antecedent annotation process identifies
antecedents of zero pronouns that need to be re-
solved. In monolingual corpora, analysts must
basically annotate antecedents of zero pronouns
manually. However, even in the manual pro-
cess, the following factors must be taken into
account.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997256333333333">
â€¢ Zero pronouns with the same syntactic and
semantic features (such as modal expres-
sions, the meaning of verbs, and conjunc-
tions) around them in the corpus should
be grouped and displayed at the same time
when their antecedents are annotated.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985029754385965">
Zero pronouns with the same features tend
to have the same type of antecedents be-
cause the features become key factors in
determining their antecedents. Therefore,
analysts can judge antecedents for zero pro-
nouns with the same features easily and ef-
ficiently.
â€¢ Antecedent candidates of zero pronouns
should be easy to select from elements in
the text or deictic elements outside the
text.
There are three types of possible an-
tecedent candidates for each zero pronoun:
candidates in the same sentence (intrasen-
tential), candidates in another sentence in
the text (intersentential), and candidates
that are not explicitly expressed in the text
(deictic). Intrasentential and intersenten-
tial antecedent candidates are actually ex-
pressed in the text. Their conditions in the
resolution rules involve their syntactic po-
sitions and/or sentential relationships such
as distance, rhetorical relation, and rela-
tive relation in the discourse structure (e.g.,
a candidate in the title of a section and
a zero pronoun in a sentence in the sec-
tion) (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa
and Ikehara, 1995). Therefore, by grouping
intra- and intersentential candidates with
the same syntactic position and senten-
tial relationship in the text, and by show-
ing the same types of candidates for zero
pronouns at the same time, we can select
the actual antecedent easily and efficiently.
Among deictic antecedent candidates, the
antecedents tend to be limited elements
such as writer! speaker or reader/hearer
(Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996). Therefore,
listing the possible antecedent candidates
before the annotation process and select-
ing the actual antecedent from the possible
antecedent candidate list make the annota-
tion process of deictic antecedents for zero
pronouns much easier and more efficient.
In the case of bilingual corpora, in addi-
tion to the manual process used for mono-
lingual corpora, the translation of a sentence
with zero pronoun can be used to determine
the antecedent of the zero pronoun. For ex-
ample, in Japanese and English bilingual cor-
pora, the subject and object are often omit-
ted in Japanese, whereas they are normally
obligatory in English. Therefore, by aligning
zero pronouns in Japanese and their translation
equivalents in English, antecedent of zero pro-
nouns can be automatically identified (Nakaiwa,
1997b).

The following types of sentences with zero pro-
nouns and/or antecedents in the corpus are not
suitable as the source sentences for extracting

(a) Sentences in which the analysis made er-

gual corpora that were freely translated
by a human. Here, it is very difficult

pora.

2.4 Rule Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97083808">
The rule extraction process extracts resolution
rules of zero pronouns with antecedent tags
in the corpus. In this process, syntactic and
semantic features around zero pronouns and
around their annotated antecedents are used as
a condition in the resolution rules.
There are two way to extract rules:
(a) Automatic Extraction
In this process, resolution rules can be au-
tomatically extracted from zero pronouns
with antecedent tags (Section 2.2) and syn-
tactic and semantic features around zero
pronouns and their annotated antecedents
by a machine learning technique (Aone
and Bennett, 1995; Yamamoto and Sumita,
1998) or by statistical processing (Nakaiwa,
1997a).
(a) Manual Extraction
In this process, zero pronouns are grouped
depending on their syntactic position, their
annotated antecedent, and the syntactic
and semantic features around the zero pro-
nouns. Resolution rules for the grouped
zero pronouns are extracted by examining
how many correct antecedents for the zero

3.1.1 Analysis of Japanese Sentences

<bodyText confidence="0.998847">
Japanese sentences are analyzed with the mor-
phological, syntactic, and semantic analyzers
of Japanese in ALT-J/E (Ikehara and et al.,
1991). The syntactic and semantic structure
of the Japanese sentence is first created. The
Japanese structure is used for the automatic
translation into English in ALT-J/E. The
Japanese structure, therefore, includes the syn-
tactic positions of the Japanese zero pronouns,
which must be translated into English, and the
semantic constraints for the Japanese zero pro-
nouns forced by the verb within the Japanese
sentence. When a zero pronoun is resolved by
a rule, a determined antecedent and an ID of
the applied rule for each zero pronoun are also
annotated. This information is used to judge
whether existing rules will resolve zero pronouns
successfully, and which zero pronouns require
further resolution rules.
For example, from the Japanese sentence in
the aligned sentence pair (2) in Figure 1, the fol-
lowing syntactic and semantic structure is cre-
ated.

the internal English structure of ALT-J/E.
For example, from the English sentence in

the two structures. Then, based on the discus-

With Japanese monolingual corpora, an analyst
who wants to make resolution rules for Japanese
zero pronouns in the corpora must annotate
their antecedents by hand. To achieve an ef-
ficient annotation process, we have developed a
tool for annotating antecedents of Japanese zero
pronouns in Japanese sentences within the cor-
pora. This process uses the analysis results of
Japanese sentences (section 3.1.1). The details
of this process are described in the following sec-
tions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999965066666667">
According to the results of the Japanese anal-
ysis in a Japanese-to-English MT system, the
zero pronouns that must be explicitly translated
in English are explicitly annotated in the syn-
tactic and semantic structure of the inputted
Japanese sentences (e.g., example (3)). How-
ever, as we discussed in section 2.3, the sentence
analysis error causes erroneous zero pronouns.
Therefore, the analyst must annotate whether
the zero pronoun candidates in the Japanese
analysis result are actually zero pronouns or
not. For efficiency, the Japanese analysis re-
sults are grouped based on whether the same
features are around zero pronoun candidates as
follows.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999765">
After identifying zero pronouns in the Japanese
sentences, an antecedent for each zero pronoun
is annotated. As with the process of zero pro-
noun identification, zero pronouns are grouped
based on the presence of the same character-
istics around the zero pronouns. To efficiently
annotate the antecedents of zero pronouns, we
also group intrasentential and intersentential
anaphora candidates according to the charac-
teristics around the candidates as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.946681">
(1) syntactic position of an antecedent candi-

same sentence (intrasentential) (e.g., a unit
sentence with a zero pronoun is directly
connected to another unit sentence by a
conjunction)
(4) discourse structural relationship (or dis-
tances) between a sentence with a zero pro-
noun and a sentence with an antecedent
candidate (intersentential) (e.g., a sentence
with a zero pronoun is the next sentence
following a sentence with an antecedent
candidate)

<bodyText confidence="0.999720304347826">
For (3), the syntactic structures of unit sen-
tences with zero pronouns are classified, and
the sentences with the same types of syntac-
tic structures are examined. For (4), typical
antecedent candidate relationships for the tar-
get corpus are selected in advance. For exam-
ple, in newspaper articles, the first sentence of
an article often contains the antecedent of a
zero pronoun in another sentence in the article
(Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992). The relationship
between sentences should be selected depending
on the target domain to achieve an efficient an-
notating process. An analyst annotates deictic
antecedents of zero pronouns by first selecting
typical antecedent candidates such as &amp;quot;I/we&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in advance and then selecting the
diectic antecedent of a zero pronoun from them.
After an antecedent for a zero pronoun is anno-

pronoun are displayed as &amp;quot;negative candidates&amp;quot;

3.5 Manual Extraction of Resolution
Rules

For the extraction of more reliable resolution
rules with human interaction, a manual rule ex-
traction process from Japanese sentences using
Japanese analysis results and tags for zero pro-
nouns and their antecedents is implemented in
the system. In the same manner as in section
3.3, the five types of features around zero pro-
nouns and their antecedents used in section 3.4
are grouped and sorted by the frequencies of the
grouped items. Therefore, wide coverage rules
are efficiently extracted in the early stage of the
extraction process. This is also effective for rule
extraction by taking into account zero pronouns
with the same types of context. The reliabil-
ity of the extracted rules is also examined in
this stage by calculating the number of applied
zero pronouns for each rule and the number of
successfully resolved zero pronouns by referring
to antecedent tags for zero pronouns. Before
the extracted rules are added to the rule set
used in ALT-J/E, inclusion relationships be-
tween rules are examined and the priorities of
extracted rules within the rule set are set.

<bodyText confidence="0.999982318181818">
The performance of the automatic extraction
process from aligned sentence pairs has been
reported in (Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b).
According to the evaluation result on the au-
tomatic alignment of Japanese zero pronouns
and the English equivalents of their antecedents,
98.4% of all pairs were automatically aligned
correctly in the training data and 94% of all
pairs in unseen test data. Furthermore, ac-
cording to their evaluation of extracted rules
for zero pronouns with deictic references, those
rules created automatically from sentence pairs
correctly resolved 99.0% of the zero pronouns
in the training data and 85.0% of the zero
pronouns in an unseen test data. Therefore,
we only evaluate the manual extraction process
from Japanese monolingual corpora. The effec-
tiveness of the proposed method of manual rule
extraction highly relies on their grouping func-
tion. Therefore, in this evaluation, we examine
the effectiveness of the manual rule extraction
with or without the grouping function.

4.1 Evaluation Method of Manual Rule
Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994255787234043">
The effectiveness and efficiency of manual rule
extraction is examined by extracting rules from
3719 Japanese sentences in a test set for evalu-
ating Japanese-to-English MT system (Ikehara
et al., 1994). An analyst who is an expert of
zero pronoun resolution in ALT-J/E, extracts
resolution rules using the implemented system
in section 3, which is installed in SUN Sparc
Enterprise 3000, in the following manner.
A. Extraction using the Grouping Function
The grouping, annotation and extraction
are conducted as follows.
Step 1 Zero pronoun candidates are grouped
according to their syntactic positions;
the candidates in the most common
syntactic position, Ni (ga-case) are se-
lected: 866 instances in 724 sentences
(Figure 2)
Step 2 Selected candidates are grouped again
according to their syntactic structure;
the candidates in the most common
syntactic structure, where a unit sen-
tence with a zero pronoun is directly
connected with another unit sentence
by a conjunction, are selected: 315 in-
stances
Step 3 Zero pronouns are annotated for the
selected candidates: 285 out of 315 in-
stances
Step 4 Antecedents of selected zero pronouns
are annotated for 285 zero pronouns
after grouping the type of conjunc-
tions.
Step 5 Five rules are extracted from 285 zero
pronouns and the required time for
making the rules is recorded.
B. Extraction without using the Grouping
Function
Rules are extracted from sentences with
zero pronoun candidates one by one with-
out using the grouping function in the time
it takes to make the five rules in test A.
The results of two tests are compared by exam-
ining how fast the antecedents of zero pronouns
can be efficiently annotated and how many zero
pronouns can be successfully resolved by using
extracted rules.

4.2 Evaluation Result
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816833333333">
Table 1 shows the results of the evaluation. As
shown in this table, zero pronouns and their
antecedents were efficiently annotated in test
A (1.1 min/item and 1.7 min/item using the
grouping function (test A), and 2.5 min/item
and 2.0 min/item without using the grouping
function (test B), respectively). Furthermore,
the rule extraction time and its application and
evaluation time were also shorter in test A than
in test B (1.1 min/item and 2.2 min/item in
test A, and 6.0 min/item and 10.0 min./item
in test B, respectively). This result indicates
that grouping results with annotated informa-
tion is helpful for making rules with wide cover-
age by taking into account the estimated result
of an extracting rule for zero pronouns that will
be applied. Regarding the quality of extracted
rules, test B extracted better rules than test A
(93 % in test A and 100 % in test B). How-
ever, the five problematic zero pronouns in test
A were already noticed by the analyst at the
rule evaluation step. Therefore, new rules for
the zero pronouns with a detailed condition will
be extracted easily by referring to this result.

This paper proposed a practical integrated tool
for extracting rules for the anaphora resolu-
tion of zero pronouns from monolingual and/or
bilingual corpora. According to the preliminary
evaluation of the manual rule extraction pro-
cess, antecedent tags for zero pronouns can be
efficiently annotated and rules are efficiently ex-
tracted from Japanese monolingual corpora by
using the tool&apos;s grouping function. In the fu-
ture, we will examine the effectiveness of the
proposed method for both monolingual and
bilingual corpora. We will also examine the
most effective combined strategies for the ex-
traction of resolution rules by using both auto-
matic and manual processes.

<abstract confidence="0.972244125">This paper proposes a practical integrated environment for extracting rules for the anaphora resolution of zero pronouns from monolingual and/or bilingual corpora. This method takes into account the practical situation for making resolution rules of zero pronouns in specific domain texts; the types of usable corpora (monolingual and/or bilingual) for examining the extraction of resolution rules have been changed depending on the type of NLP system using extracted resolution rules. The extraction processes of resolution rules in the environment are classified into five component tasks: (1) Zero Pronoun Identification, (2) Antecedent Annotation, (3) Rejection of Sentences Unsuitable for Rule Extraction, (4) Rule Extraction, and Extracted and Modification. An automatic process and/or a manual process with a user friendly human interface can be used to achieve each component task. This environment was implemented in the Japanesemachine translation system, ALT- Japanese zero pronoun resolution.</abstract>

Furthermore, resolution rules often have to be made depending on the target domain of the documents, and this also requires the timeconsuming labor of experts. Because of these problems, there is a need for an effective and efficient method of making resolution rules for zero pronouns. Typical methods for this purpose include extracting resolution rules for zero pronouns from monolingual corpora (Nasukawa, 1996; Murata and Nagao, 1997), from bilingual corpora (Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b), and from monolingual corpora with tags for antecedents of zero pronouns (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yamamoto and Sumita, 1998). Monolingual corpora are relatively easy to collect. Methods using monolingual corpora, however, have difficulties in extracting resolution rules of zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese. Methods using sentence-aligned bilingual corpora are better than those using monolingual corpora. This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of dissimilar languages such as Japanese and English whose language families are so different and where the distributions of zero pronouns are also quite different. However, bilingual corpora are relatively d</context>

In this process, syntactic and semantic features around zero pronouns and around their annotated antecedents are used as a condition in the resolution rules. There are two way to extract rules: (a) Automatic Extraction In this process, resolution rules can be automatically extracted from zero pronouns with antecedent tags (Section 2.2) and syntactic and semantic features around zero pronouns and their annotated antecedents by a machine learning technique (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yamamoto and Sumita, 1998) or by statistical processing (Nakaiwa, 1997a). (a) Manual Extraction In this process, zero pronouns are grouped depending on their syntactic position, their annotated antecedent, and the syntactic and semantic features around the zero pronouns. Resolution rules for the grouped zero pronouns are extracted by examining how many correct antecedents for the zero Japanese and English Bilingual Corpus Japanese Monolingual Corpus Aligned Sentence Pair Japanese Sentence English Sentence &amp;quot;I want to read a book.&amp;quot; Japanese Sentence &amp;quot;hon-o yomi-tai.&amp;quot; English Analyzer Automatic</context>

In Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, therefore, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (&amp;quot;zero pronouns&amp;quot;) for their accurate translation into English expressions. Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Yoshimoto, 1988; Walker et al., 1990; Dohsaka, 1-For example, there are 93 omitted case elements in 102 sentences in 30 newspaper articles which have to be explicitly translated into English. 1994).

An automatic process and/or a manual process with a user friendly human interface can be used to achieve each component task. This environment was implemented in the Japaneseto-English machine translation system, ALTJ/E, for Japanese zero pronoun resolution. 1 Introduction In natural languages, elements that can be easily deduced by a reader are frequently omitted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978). This phenomenon causes considerable problems in NLP systems such as MT, text summarization and text retrieval. In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese, whereas they are normally obligatory in English&apos;. In Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, therefore, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (&amp;quot;zero pronouns&amp;quot;) for their accurate translation into English expressions. Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Yoshimoto, 1988; Walker et al., 1990; Dohsaka, 1-For example, there ar</context>

Intrasentential and intersentential antecedent candidates are actually expressed in the text. Their conditions in the resolution rules involve their syntactic positions and/or sentential relationships such as distance, rhetorical relation, and relative relation in the discourse structure (e.g., a candidate in the title of a section and a zero pronoun in a sentence in the section) (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995). Therefore, by grouping intra- and intersentential candidates with the same syntactic position and sentential relationship in the text, and by showing the same types of candidates for zero pronouns at the same time, we can select the actual antecedent easily and efficiently.

For example, in newspaper articles, the first sentence of an article often contains the antecedent of a zero pronoun in another sentence in the article (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992). The relationship between sentences should be selected depending on the target domain to achieve an efficient annotating process. An analyst annotates deictic antecedents of zero pronouns by first selecting typical antecedent candidates such as &amp;quot;I/we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in advance and then selecting the diectic antecedent of a zero pronoun from them.

According to the evaluation result on the automatic alignment of Japanese zero pronouns and the English equivalents of their antecedents, 98.4% of all pairs were automatically aligned correctly in the training data and 94% of all pairs in unseen test data. Furthermore, according to their evaluation of extracted rules for zero pronouns with deictic references, those rules created automatically from sentence pairs correctly resolved 99.0% of the zero pronouns in the training data and 85.0% of the zero pronouns in an unseen test data.

Resolution rules for the grouped zero pronouns are extracted by examining how many correct antecedents for the zero Japanese and English Bilingual Corpus Japanese Monolingual Corpus Aligned Sentence Pair Japanese Sentence English Sentence &amp;quot;I want to read a book.&amp;quot; Japanese Sentence &amp;quot;hon-o yomi-tai.&amp;quot; English Analyzer Automatic Alignment of Japanese Zero Pronouns and their Antecedents Words / Phras</context>

Next, the Japanese zero pronouns in the Japanese sentences and the translation equivalents of their antecedents in English sentences are extracted using 10 hand-developed alignment rules. For example, from the zero pronoun in the ga-case (subject) in the Japanese sentence in 2This process is implemented by using the alignment method proposed by Nakaiwa (Nakaiwa, 1997b).

The reliability of the extracted rules is also examined in this stage by calculating the number of applied zero pronouns for each rule and the number of successfully resolved zero pronouns by referring to antecedent tags for zero pronouns. Before the extracted rules are added to the rule set used in ALT-J/E, inclusion relationships between rules are examined and the priorities of extracted rules within the rule set are set. 4 Preliminary Evaluation The performance of the automatic extraction process from aligned sentence pairs has been reported in (Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b). According to the evaluation result on the automatic alignment of Japanese zero pronouns and the English equivalents of their antecedents, 98.4% of all pairs were automatically aligned correctly in the training data and 94% of all pairs in unseen test data. Furthermore, according to their evaluation of extracted rules for zero pronouns with deictic references, those rules created automatically from sentence pairs correctly resolved 99.0% of the zero pronouns in the training data and 85.0% of the zero pronouns in an unseen test data. Therefore, we only evaluate the manual ext</context>

Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time and effort for the experts of the NLP system to make these rules robust and with wide coverage. Furthermore, resolution rules often have to be made depending on the target domain of the documents, and this also requires the timeconsuming labor of experts. Because of these problems, there is a need for an effective and efficient method of making resolution rules for zero pronouns. Typical methods for this purpose include extracting resolution rules for zero pronouns from monolingual corpora (Nasukawa, 1996; Murata and Nagao, 1997), from bilingual corpora (Nakaiwa, 1997a; Nakaiwa, 1997b), and from monolingual corpora with tags for antecedents of zero pronouns (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Yamamoto and Sumita, 1998). Monolingual corpora are relatively easy to collect. Methods using monolingual corpora, however, have difficulties in extracting resolution rules of zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese. Methods using sentence-aligned bilingual corpora are better than those using monolingual corpora. This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of dissimilar languages such </context>
