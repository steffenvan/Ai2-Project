<bodyText confidence="0.999657909090909">
We present UBIU, a language indepen-
dent system for detecting full coreference
chains, composed of named entities, pro-
nouns, and full noun phrases which makes
use of memory based learning and a fea-
ture model following Rahman and Ng
(2009). UBIU is evaluated on the task
“Coreference Resolution in Multiple Lan-
guages” (SemEval Task 1 (Recasens et al.,
2010)) in the context of the 5th Interna-
tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996628">
Coreference resolution is a field in which major
progress has been made in the last decade. Af-
ter a concentration on rule-based systems (cf. e.g.
(Mitkov, 1998; Poesio et al., 2002; Markert and
Nissim, 2005)), machine learning methods were
embraced (cf. e.g. (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and
Cardie, 2002)). However, machine learning based
coreference resolution is only possible for a very
small number of languages. In order to make such
resources available for a wider range of languages,
language independent systems are often regarded
as a partial solution. To this day, there have been
only a few systems reported that work on multiple
languages (Mitkov, 1999; Harabagiu and Maio-
rano, 2000; Luo and Zitouni, 2005). However, all
of those systems were geared towards predefined
language sets.
In this paper, we present a language indepen-
dent system that does require syntactic resources
for each language but does not require any effort
for adapting the system to a new language, except
for minimal effort required to adapt the feature ex-
tractor to the new language. The system was com-
pletely developed within 4 months, and will be ex-
tended to new languages in the future.

2 UBIU: System Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999703125">
The UBIU system aims at being a language-
independent system in that it uses a combination
of machine learning, in the form of memory-based
learning (MBL) in the implementation of TiMBL
(Daelemans et al., 2007), and language indepen-
dent features. MBL uses a similarity metric to find
the k nearest neighbors in the training data in order
to classify a new example, and it has been shown
to work well for NLP problems (Daelemans and
van den Bosch, 2005). Similar to the approach
by Rahman and Ng (2009), classification in UBUI
is based on mention pairs (having been shown to
work well for German (Wunsch, 2009)) and uses
as features standard types of linguistic annotation
that are available for a wide range of languages
and are provided by the task.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the system. In
preprocessing, we slightly change the formatting
of the data in order to make it suitable for the next
step in which language dependent feature extrac-
tion modules are used, from which the training and
test sets for the classification are extracted. Our
approach is untypical in that it first extracts the
heads of possible antecedents during feature ex-
traction. The full yield of an antecedent in the test
set is determined after classification in a separate
module. During postprocessing, final decisions
are made concerning which of the mention pairs
are considered for the final coreference chains.
In the following sections, we will describe fea-
ture extraction, classification, markable extraction,
and postprocessing in more detail.

to the given language data (different POS tagsets,
differences in the provided annotations). This is
the only language dependent part of the system.
We decided to separate the task of finding heads
of markables, which then serve as the basis for the
generation of the feature vectors, from the identi-
fication of the scope of a markable. For the En-
glish sentence “Any details or speculation on who
specifically, we don’t know that at this point.”, we
first detect the heads of possible antecedents, for
example “details”. However, the decision on the
scope of the markable, i.e. the decision between
“details” or “Any details or speculation on who
specifically” is made in the postprocessing phase.
One major task of the language modules is the
check for cyclic dependencies. Our system re-
lies on the assumption that cyclic dependencies do
not occur, which is a standard assumption in de-
pendency parsing (K¨ubler et al., 2009). However,
since some of the data sets in the multilingual task
contained cycles, we integrated a module in the
preprocessing step that takes care of such cycles.
After the identification of the heads of mark-
ables, the actual feature extraction is performed.
The features that were used for training a classifier
(see Table 1) were selected from the feature pool

presented by Rahman and Ng (2009). Note that
not all features could be used for all languages.
We extracted all the features in Table 1 if the cor-
responding type of annotation was available; oth-
erwise, a null value was assigned.
A good example for the latter concerns the gen-
der information represented by feature 7 (for pos-
sible feature values cf. Table 1). Let us consider
the following two entries - the first from the Ger-
man data set and the second from English:

Extracting the value from entry 1, where
gend=fem, is straightforward; the value being F.
However, there is no gender information provided
in the English data (entry 2). As a result, the value
for feature 7 is U for the closed task.

optimization across all languages. Since a full op-
timization strategy would lead to an unmanageable
number of system runs, we concentrated on vary-
ing k, the number of nearest neighbors considered
in classification, and on the distance metric.
Furthermore, the optimization is focused on
language independence. Hence, we did not op-
timize each classifier separately but selected pa-
rameters that lead to best average results across
all languages of the shared task. In our opinion,
this ensures an acceptable performance for new
languages without further adaptation. The optimal
settings for all the given languages were k=3 with
the Overlap distance and gain ratio weighting.

2.3 Markable Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969304">
The markable extractor makes use of the depen-
dency relation labels. Each syntactic head together
with all its dependents is identified as a separate
markable. This approach is very sensitive to incor-
rect annotations and to dependency cycles in the
data set. It is also sensitive to differences between
the syntactic annotation and markables. In the
Dutch data, for example, markables for named en-
tities (NE) often exclude the determiner, a nominal
dependent in the dependency annotation. Thus,
the markable extractor suggests the whole phrase
as a markable, rather than just the NE.
During the development phase, we determined
experimentally that the recognition of markables
is one of the most important steps in order to
achieve high accuracy in coreference resolution:
We conducted an ablation study on the training
data set. We used the train data as training set and
the devel data as testing set and investigated three
different settings:

<listItem confidence="0.978170888888889">
1. Gold standard setting: Uses gold markable
annotations as well as gold linguistic anno-
tations (upper bound).
2. Gold linguistic setting: Uses automatically
determined markables and gold linguistic an-
notations.
3. Regular setting: Uses automatically deter-
mined markables and automatic linguistic in-
formation.

figures in Setting 2 and 3 are very similar. This
means that the deterioration from gold to automat-
ically annotated linguistic information is barely
visible in the coreference results. This is a great
advantage, since gold-standard data has always
proved to be very expensive and difficult or im-
possible to obtain. The information that proved to
be extremely important for the performance of the
system is the one providing the boundaries of the
markables. As shown in Table 2, the latter leads to
an improvement of about 20%, which is observ-
able in the difference in the figures of Setting 1
and 2. The results for the different languages show
that it is more important to improve markable de-
tection than the linguistic information.

2.4 Postprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997685">
In Section 2.1, we described that we decided to
separate the task of finding heads of markables
from the identification of the scope of a markable.
Thus, in the postprocessing step, we perform the
latter (by the Markables Extractor module) as well
as reformat the data for evaluation.
Another very important step during postpro-
cessing is the selection of possible antecedents. In
cases where more than one mention pair is classi-
fied as coreferent, only the pair with highest con-
fidence by TiMBL is selected. Since nouns can
be discourse-new, they do not necessarily have a
coreferent antecedent; pronouns however, require
an antecedent. Thus, in cases where all possible
antecedents for a given pronoun are classified as
not coreferent, we select the closest subject as an-
tecedent; or if this heuristic is not successful, the
antecedent that has been classified as not corefer-
ent with the lowest confidence score (i.e. the high-
est distance) by TiMBL.

UBIU participated in the closed task (i.e. only in-
formation provided in the data sets could be used),
in the gold and regular setting. It was one of two
systems that submitted results for all languages,
which we count as preliminary confirmation that
our system is language independent. The final re-
sults of UBIU are shown in Table 3. The figures
for the identification of mentions show that this is
an area in which the system needs to be improved.
The errors in the gold setting result from an in-
compatibility of our two-stage markable annota-
tion with the gold setting. We are planning to use
a classifier for mention identification in the future.
The results for coreference detection show that
English has a higher accuracy than all the other
languages. We assume that this is a consequence
of using a feature set that was developed for En-
glish (Rahman and Ng, 2009). This also means
that an optimization of the feature set for individ-
ual languages should result in improved system
performance.

We have presented UBIU, a coreference resolution
system that is language independent (given differ-
ent linguistic annotations for languages). UBIU
is easy to maintain, and it allows the inclusion of
new languages with minimal effort.
For the future, we are planning to improve the
system while strictly adhering to the language in-
dependence. We are planning to separate pronoun
and definite noun classification, with the possibil-
ity of using different feature sets. We will also
investigate language independent features and im-
plement a markable classifier and a negative in-

MBL uses a similarity metric to find the k nearest neighbors in the training data in order to classify a new example, and it has been shown to work well for NLP problems (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005). Similar to the approach by Rahman and Ng (2009), classification in UBUI is based on mention pairs (having been shown to work well for German (Wunsch, 2009)) and uses as features standard types of linguistic annotation that are available for a wide range of languages and are provided by the task. Figure 1 shows an overview of the system. In preprocessing, we slightly change the formatting of the data in order to make it suitable for the next step in which language dependent feature extraction modules are used, from which the training and test sets for the classification are extracted. Our approach is untypical in that it first extracts the </context>

Note that not all features could be used for all languages. We extracted all the features in Table 1 if the corresponding type of annotation was available; otherwise, a null value was assigned. A good example for the latter concerns the gender information represented by feature 7 (for possible feature values cf. Table 1). Let us consider the following two entries - the first from the German data set and the second from English: 1.

The figures for the identification of mentions show that this is an area in which the system needs to be improved. The errors in the gold setting result from an incompatibility of our two-stage markable annotation with the gold setting. We are planning to use a classifier for mention identification in the future. The results for coreference detection show that English has a higher accuracy than all the other languages. We assume that this is a consequence of using a feature set that was developed for English (Rahman and Ng, 2009). This also means that an optimization of the feature set for individual languages should result in improved system performance. 4 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented UBIU, a coreference resolution system that is language independent (given different linguistic annotations for languages). UBIU is easy to maintain, and it allows the inclusion of new languages with minimal effort. For the future, we are planning to improve the system while strictly adhering to the language independence. We are planning to separate pronoun and definite noun classification, with the possibility of using d</context>
